I used a couple pieces of twine. The neck rope is just a semichunky piece of cording.Body Fleece! The right orange is hard to find. I winged it with the pattern. Basic body shape lightly stuffed so his clothes look wrinkly. I also added a couple pipe cleaners in the armshands so he can pose and hold his lollipop.   Lollipop Small dowel for the handle sculpted the lolli and used a mixture of acrylics to get the right color. Definitely a process but totally worth it.

169111,0,t1_cexjxgl,Thank you for your answer and congratulations on your work. Do you agree however that there is an audience for this subgenre for lack of a better word?On another topic I found it interesting that the killers focus was on femininity and not necessarily on mommy issues that certainly could be the case. I asume this was a very conscious decision and one with restrictive consequences on the character development front. There is nevertheless a clear sense of control issues in this killers particular pathology. Was there a model from which this character emerged? I have to say that the film has in all a sense of sincerity that I found very refreshing. Plot development and action is all very clear cut. Probably I say this because I just recently saw Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones and Insidious  where in one the interpretation is very tenuous and in another the events are so fastidiously interconnected with the whole mythology where it gets too rigid.,horror,cexp124,1,t5_2qh9x

234748,0,t1_cf51eed,Ive watched all three countless times and Day is probably my favorite although I do go back n forth. Day of the dead is the installment in the series that tries to deal with the fear using science to demystify the unknown.  Where Night was being in fear and reacting to it and Dawn was about coping. Day is about facing the fear head on.  The others had  elements of religion where this has elements of science.  In the end neither one can save us. In the opening scenes we see an empty city quiet and peaceful but something is quite off meaningless money floating down the street like tumbleweeds alligator freely roaming the street.  And there it is zombies haven taken over the streets the zombies have won and they could care less.  We are now in a postapocalyptic world where there is no turning back a group of rednecks hunting zombies isnt going to do away with the problem.  While the dead walk the earth the living are now underneath the ground as if they were the buried dead.  Something must be done but what?  The character development and group interaction is great in all dead movies but with Day it stands out the most. Its a great microcosm of society and commentary on the military industrial complex without being too literal.  And once again it is not the zombie that are the greatest threat to our characters survival but it is the characters themselves.  As opposed to Night where the rescuers become the enemy and Dawn where nomad bikers become the enemy in Day it is the people of the same group and they are driving each other mad.The gore in Day really stands out. The death scenes are memorable.  The zombie attacks really escalate and create great tension. And I feel like it is the film that explains the Romero zombie mythology the most.  ,horror,cf52xti,10,t5_2qh9x

271155,0,t1_cf88zdz,Just finished watching and I really enjoyed it. Damn you definitely used that visceral haunting environment to its highest potential! Ive always felt that in a classic gothic storytelling the setting is as much a character as the cast and that really came through here. Similar to the relationship here in the US that we share with the south. When the trees and sky breath with that kind of life or death I can tell how much care and effort was put into this.I also really enjoyed your use of color the contrasting shades of warm and cold and the timelessness of the surroundings. With the exception of a few scenes this is a story that could have taken place either yesterday or a century ago. I wont go into too much detail to avoid spoilers for anyone who hasnt seen this but Evies dance sequence was one of the most beautiful hypnotic scenes Ive witnessed in a long time. I thought her character and the interactions shared between her and James were spot on realistic and she gave off a strangely addictive aura. It was an honest unique portrayal. I really hope more people give this a chance. Its truly a dark experience in textures emotions and the fragility of the human psyche. I will be sure to follow your future efforts and recommend this to others.,horror,cf8v67v,3,t5_2qh9x

415031,0,t1_cfnrq64,Im not going to bother with spoiler text because otherwise this entire post will be a wall of black. Just assume if someone reading this hasnt seen the film that everything from here on out is a spoiler.In the end I think the spirit of Madeline OMalley is just a maguffin. Shes a catchall spurned woman with unrequited love and a tragic life who could be taking it out on people in the hotel.As for the old man I assumed from the moment that he checked in that he was going to kill himself. It was clear his wife had died and he would be dying soon himself so I just thought he wanted to kill himself in the room they spent their honeymoon. Which is also the room Madeline OMalley killed herself in. I think technically the two are unrelated beyond the cosmic coincidence of very similar deaths.As for Madelines motive who knows. Is she jealous? Is she just angry? Is she not real and just the product of Sara Paxtons imagination? She seems pretty sure that the hotel is haunted and has littletono evidence for that until late in the movie and she only actually sees anything after the psychic has freaked her out and she has that head injury in the basement. I think there are ghosts in the film myselfthe last shot pretty much confirms this but I dont think the film was ever about their motives. ,horror,cfns80e,3,t5_2qh9x

But your opinion of what is and isnt horror actually discounts my favorite type of horror film. I was creeped out significantly by say Lake Mungo but that film has not a single scary scenethats arguable I know but it isnt meant to be a jump scare. The type of horror I prefer is actually of the slower more suspenseful variety. If you look back at the early classics the films of Val Lewton or even Roger Corman theres a lot of those films that arent scary in the way you define it but are without a doubt horror.I guess the lesson weve all learned from this very long thread is that tastes and definitions in art are subjective.,horror,cfzev1f,1,t5_2qh9x

It was edited by Del Howison and Joseph Nassise. The stories are about the Breed looking to find their way in a world that doesnt want them after the destruction of their home. I havent heard if Barker wrote for it the editors did work with him in the development of the anthology from my understandingat least to give authorization for use of his intellectual property but it would be awesome if he did.

Alvarez took the arrow straight parts of Evil Dead and injected them with every steroid he could find. The black humor is gone sure but the removal of the humor allowed the terror of the story to take center stage. In an era where horror movies need to have a twist or need to pander to some modern trend found footage film comes immediately to mind to be noticed and are ultimately not very scary or original because of these trappings Alvarez offered audiences an honesttoGod simple terrifying story.The first Evil Dead film proved that you dont need to be serious to be an effective horror story. The new Evil Dead film proved that you dont need a reason to make a horror movie save for wanting to make a scary horror movie.I think its a worthy successor to the franchise title.,horror,ciz6ry5,42,t5_2qh9x
1473262,0,t1_cj0w32m,Nothing to be embarrassed about  it is a bit of a mess. There are a couple cuts of it. The theatrical cut was the result of an editing massacre by the studio. There is another more recent cut that followed detailed instructions from Welles about how to recut the studio version into something artful.

1686701,0,t3_2dnnwz,One of my favorite films of the year.  Seems I liked it for the same reasons that others disliked it. The pacing the twists and the characters. I wouldnt call this a slasher at all. It didnt even seem like most films that would be labeled psychological horror here though thats the subgenre label Id assign to it. I expect it wont be many horror fans cup of tea. Most of the time it felt much more like a drama albeit a weird indie drama with no clear direction where every so often something fucked up happens and its just there without much closure or explanation. For me those long stretches of ambiguous drama and mystery made the more fucked up moments more powerful. I also liked the abruptness of the ending.,horror,cjrru7l,3,t5_2qh9x

Havent seen those other movies but it sounds like I might want to check them out.Edit To clarify the thing I liked about Oculus might not be the thing youre seeing in the other movies. I dont really give a shit about spooky mirrors or murdered families though again as a horror fan I get a kick out of that stuff its just not what makes the movie excellent. I love the way it explores subjectivity and obsession in a supernatural context because these are the channels through which the supernatural could plausibly act on our world. That sounds kind of pretentious written out. Sorry if it comes off that way.The older you get the harder it is to buy into a supernatural premise. And if thats what youre after it takes increasingly clever mechanisms to get it all to feel real.  Oculus just got that so perfectly right I didnt care about two weak performances.

Meaning we saw in the movie that BOTH characters experienced bouts of ... problems ... with language. What if those last twenty minutes of film you were observing from the perspective of the first stages of infection of the virus?

For one you started with Halloween. My first time with horror was Gremlins. Couldnt sleep for weeks. Parents had no idea what was wrong with me.Years later when I realized I should approach movies as works of fiction I tried a marathon of NOES Nightmare on Elm Street Freddys Revenge and Dream Child. Once again couldnt sleep for weeks.It took Halloween to make me love being scared. After seeing it for the first time I realized I was a fan of the genre. Also that I wasnt the biggest fan of sleep.  Do you still really enjoy it all these years actually is it years? later?As for the comedic potential of horror Ive seen plenty that have had me rolling. I cant think of too many that have made me sad though. Any examples?,horror,ckx0psz,1,t5_2qh9x

I enjoyed the first half a lot more with the more lowkey scares the dark corners the wardrobe etc. All of that was pretty ace as was the beautiful cinematography. Once stereotypical ugly ghosts started popping up all over the place and especially once the mother is full on possessed and flung all over the house I lost interest in it.

2121091,0,t3_2j8rvq,Slowed down in the s? I feel like Scream revitalized the subgenre. It was on its death rattle until  then there was a flood of slasher films   Scream   Scream    Urban Legend   I Know What You Did Last Summer   I Still Know What You Did Last Summer   Idle Hands   Halloween H   Disturbing Behavior   The Faculty  This wave would run into the early s with films like Final Destination Valentine Jeepers Creepers and various sequels to several of these late s slasher films before succumbing to the more torturous evolution into films like Wrong Turn and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Those obviously turned into films like Saw and whatnot. While the traditional slasher may have evolved into something barely recognizable now I feel like there are still a fair share of decent to forgettable postScream slashers. Anyway I think the landscape is still ripe for the traditional slasher maybe not the postmodern slasher just yet that was kind of oversaturating the market in the last  years. Maybe once the summer comic book blockbuster crazy dies the summer slasher will steal box offices again. I dunno...maybe not. These days studios are less apt to greenlight those  million dollar movies that return  million it seems like every major studio is trying to develop their own cinematic universe and chase Marvel numbers.

2203142,0,t3_2k99ii,From IMDBThe mask Michael wears is the exact same mask a repainted and modified Captain Kirk mask worn in the original film. It looks different in the sequel because the paint had faded due to a few reasons first because Nick Castle the original Michael kept it in his back pocket during shoots. Also Debra Hill kept the mask under her bed for several years until the filming of Halloween II causing it to collect dust and yellow because Hill was a heavy smoker. Also the mask appears wider because Dick Warlock is shorter and stockier than Nick Castle so the mask fit his head differently. As the producers thought it would be the final sequel in the series they let Warlock keep the mask scalpel boots jumpsuit and knife used in filming. When they decided to revive Michael in Halloween  The Return of Michael Myers the producers realized they had made a mistake and never again gave props out to the cast and crew therefore subsequent sequels used different masks that looked rather different.,horror,cljvg0q,5,t5_2qh9x

I think the mother had never gotten over her husband dying and since it happened by him driving her to the hospital to have her son the traumatic experience and situation caused her to blame her son. Due to her sons behavioral issues maybe she hates having to do it alone. In the beginning it seemed to me that she just went through the motions of being a mother. For example in the beginning when the son tells her I love you and she responds with something like me too.

Reality rarely offers us such clearcut paths to wellness though its usually an ongoing struggle with no clear absolute victory after which we can show the credits and contentedly fade to black.I wonder how many horrorphiles are really just using horror as a safe amp acceptable way to feed their own personal Babadook some worms?,horror,cmgay62,38,t5_2qh9x

2483857,0,t3_2o0ids,For starters I like antagonists who actually talk and have personalities. Silent killers like Jason and Michael Myers are uninteresting to me as actual characters. Their only value to me is as engines of gory violence. What I like are villains who are competent in any of a few different ways.For example Richie from Meeting Evil the villain from Blackout Hannibal Lecter from the TV series the villain from In Fear Mick from Wolf Creek Peter and Paul from Funny Games The Girl in Neighbor and Dario in Wake Up and Die They can pass themselves off as normal sane even trustworthy people then suddenly they say or do something inappropriate and maybe the mask drops right there or maybe they draw the ambiguity out for awhile so you think maybe theyre joking or eccentric or that theres some misunderstanding but really theyre a predator toying with your expectation of normal human behavior. They can engage in a kind of psychological torment that the masked psycho cannot. I like acting ability in a villain. Thats the scary thing about psychopaths in my eyes not their capacity for violenceeveryone has that but their ability to hide in plain sight as opposed to the sorts of killers who have to hide in the literal darkness because anyone who sees them knows to run away.Then there are others like Jigsaw from the Saw franchise John Doe from Seven Hannibal Lecter from his films Azazel from Fallen the mirror from Oculus the killer in The Poughkeepsie Tapes What I like about them is their ability to outsmart and manipulate the protagonist. I like to see a battle of wits where the protagonist is led to believe that they have the upper hand but then its revealed that theyre playing right into the villains plans.Also there are what I call the badasses. John Ryder from The Hitcher and Driver from No One Lives are the best examples. With the sorts of stunts they pull off they could be action heroes if not for their malevolence. I love the idea of a villain who doesnt need to isolate his victims from the police because he can shoot police helicopters out of the fucking sky if need be.,horror,cmis10y,3,t5_2qh9x

2813545,0,t1_cnnvg8d,No you didnt get it. Learn from someone who did gtI thoroughly enjoyed the shit out of Tusk. And to Smiths credit Im pretty sure I enjoyed it for all the same reasons that he had a blast making it and for all the same reasons he knew a small niche of viewers would love it. As Smith said in an interview I just wanted to showcase Michael Parks in a fucked up story where he could recite some Lewis Carroll and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner to some poor motherfucker.gtMichael Parks is phenomenal as Howe the psychopathic wheelchair philosopher. A long scene in which Howe regales Wallace with stories of drinking with Hemingway in Normandy is easily the best sequence of dialogue Smith has ever written. Wallaces every word is that of a noble worldly seamanif only that seaman were the lovechild of Hannibal Lecter and Dr. Moreau.gtFurthermore Kevin Smith writes a character in Howard Howe that is completely fleshed out. Even the greatest horror films too often leave us with questions as to who the villain really was and from whence his darkest motives were borne. In the case of Texas Chainsaw and Halloween perhaps this was so we could get hit over the head with a neverending shower of sequels. But in Tusk everything is laid on the tableand the story of our villain is brilliantly constructed with thoughtfully researched and historically creative flair.gtOther strong points in Tusk include special effects makeup that is both hilarious and also some of the most wonderfully gruesome creaturefeature imagery since Slither. And Justin Longs performance proves that after Drag Me to Hell and Jeepers Creepers this guy was put on Earth to do one thing play a hyperbolically snide scaredshitless version of himself in horror movies.  ,horror,cnnw4ug,-1,t5_2qh9x

2986470,0,t3_2ubnu6,They dropped the ball when it came to mystery and characterization. They had the investigation arc but after Hoffmans complicity was revealed to the audience in part  that left three movies with no more whodunnit just a monotonous catandmouse game between Hoffman and various equally bland characters coupled with more exposition and flashbacks about Kramer than we really needed. Granted Tobin Bells performance was fantastic but come on.Then there were the victim of the week subplots. Again they gave up on the mystery aspect. With parts  and  neither the characters nor the viewer knew why they were chosen or what the key to escaping was. We had to work it out as the characters did. Only part  did a clever job of replicating that. I dont know what the fuck part  thought it was doing. That whole film felt like filler that only existed to set up part . and s VOTW subplots were just exercises in sadism with victims set up as unsympathetic and traps set up for flimsy reasons just because the plots required more bodies to put through the grinder. Im a fan of sadism and gore for its own sake but these films couldve been entertaining on more levels if in addition to elaborate death traps they had provided characters worth investing in and something remotely resembling suspense. I mean was anybody in the audience actually expecting the insurance executive to survive? These parts of  and  were like Final Destination with machines.,horror,co7jmjk,1,t5_2qh9x

3128064,0,t1_colytih,Kings story was more supernatural but I still think the book had a point to it. I think the point to the book is our past can haunt us and also be our weakness. Jacks dad was an alcoholic and aggressive which unwillingly got passed down to Jack and could possibly be passed down to Danny to keep going until something changes. This happens all the time with people being alcoholics and they blame their fathers or mothers for being alcoholics and so on. I also believe he shows how people are greedy because Wendy doesnt want to go home to her mothers even though she wants to leave and doesnt trust jack. Jack is greedy because he wants to get his job back at stovington and needs a job for the time being so he stays. Both want to leave but dont because of the other choice not being as compelling even though they know they should leave. Danny also shows the innocence of children and how they try to please the people they love. ,horror,com7zxo,2,t5_2qh9x

3166789,0,t1_cop7ch7,Been playing it for a while now and Im very impressed. Its one of the few zombie survival games that I actually enjoy. I love the zombie concept but I think the genre is so popular that it makes every twobit jackass want to make a zombie game or a movie which unfortunately means a lot of the additions to the genre are going to be total shit.Dying Light is actually quite good and it seems it got just about everything right that its predecessors got wrong. I was a little skeptical about the freerunning mechanic because its kind of become a gimmick yet its actually quite smooth and useful in the game. The only issue I have is that the weapon crafting system is kind of cliched. I can understand putting nails in a baseball bat or adding attachments to a firearm but I kind of feel silly walking around with a machete with a blow torch duct taped to the side. There are so many different types of melee weapons in the game that I feel like they didnt really need to add ridiculous elemental effects to the weapons in the crafting menu. Just allow us to upgrade them by putting nails in bats or sharpening blades. I dont need to duct tape a battery to the side of my machete so it electrocutes zombies.Also Ive been playing it for a long time and Ive only come across five firearms. Two automatic pistols two automatic rifles and one double barrel shotgun. Thats it and they cant even be upgraded in any way.

3292176,0,t1_cp3dtqt,Ive had lucid dreams.  For me theyve always arisen from a repetition of some sort in a dream that essentially just became too much.  The first was as a kid I had a recurring nightmare.  Over and over a TRex or King Kong would walk into my bedroom and eat me up.  Very simple short and scary.  Except I just kept having it over and over and over night after night.  Until one night I remembered this is a dream.  So I laughed and the TRex looked taken aback and then I woke.  The next time I was having a dream where I was walking around an empty building going up stairs.  Over and over and over.  Then I got stuck in a weird way.  My foot got stuck between the iron staircases.  You know you go up one level then a landing then turn and go up another like in a stairwell and theres a gap between the stairs.

3329200,0,t3_2y9nxl,Your question only makes sense if you assume that theres some sort of universal hierarchy of scarinessgrossnesscreepiness etc. where if someone can make it through a film higher on the hierarchy that means itll be no problem for them to tolerate everything below it. So if someone makes it through whatevers at the top that somehow renders them immune to horror. But thats not how it works. There is no one movie at the top because everybody has their own personal hierarchyif there are even hierarchies at all.For example A Serbian Film one of my favorites. I had no trouble making it through that. Same with Martyrs Men Behind The Sun Inside August Underground Murder Set Pieces Chaos etc.But Septic Man grossed me out and I dont even have the stomach to try watching Lucifer Valentine Vomit Gore Trilogy. See rape gore and torture are low on my personal hierarchy compared to shit and vomit.The only way to get a movie like the one youre looking for would be for it to be packed full of everything that could possibly push anybodys buttons not just all the right content but also the right aspects of execution because poor actingeffectspacingsoundtracketc. can ruin the mood.

3470824,0,t1_cpnpxew,Saw it in New York last week. Do not go in thinking youre about to see Gods gift to horror fans. Its not. What it is is a movie with a couple cool ideas a pretty creepy and very distinct atmosphere and a small handful of good tense moments. Nothing more nothing less. The hype on this one is ungodly and so some people are coming out way more disappointed than if theyd managed their expectations and were only looking for something cool and unique instead of the best horror film of the decade. ,horror,cpnwd9s,11,t5_2qh9x
3471722,0,t3_2zz9sl,I liked it.  It proved that his wife could do more than the same Baby character over and over.  Fantastic style.  I loved how after the frenetic handheld style of the Halloween films and The Devils Rejects he made this one feel period without being period.  The camera work was controlled and cinematic.  Beautifully shot even though the picture had no budget.  It was maybe his cheapest film to date yet it looked the most expensive.My only real problem isnt anything too big but I find the conflation of devil worship and witchcraft kind of tedious now.  Im fully sure that this is something that Zombie uses because its so common in pop culture not to mention very specific to the periods hes referencing but that plus its like The Conjuring use of the Salem Witch hysteria as well would have been too much had it not been for how well he builds suspense and mood and how nice it looked.This film proved he was capable of more than just white trash gothic.,horror,cpo029l,3,t5_2qh9x

3545203,0,t3_2ywk41,Im just going to copy and paste what I wrote on my Facebook earlier this evening on my thoughts. We can possibly agree to disagree but I was pretty disappointed with this movie. And I went in really really excited to watch it! POSITIVESNice foreboding atmosphere.The creep factor was fantastic. Just thinking about somewhere in the world while you sleep play hang out eat anything really theres some thing in the world walking to your location as if it has a shining beacon on you. It knows exactly where you are at all times and eventually will catch up to you to kill you.Unknown actors can be a good thing for a horror film. People youve never really seen much of can really surprise you. How scary is it? Id give it an . Its just enough to keep you wanting more but not too much where it forces you out.NEGATIVESThe film was an obvious cautionary tale. Ooh be careful who you have sex with! Not only was it incredibly obvious at the getgo but it still spent the majority of its time hammering a point that we already knew. Well unless youre incredibly oblivious and I like to think that I know smarter people.Not enough backstory on the creature. Questions arose in my mind as I asked Well what IS it? What are the rules to its existence? How did it come about? What definition of sex does it operate by? They spent too much time running away then hanging out then running away then hanging out again. What ever happened to characters trying to figure out what it was? Or how about any loopholes to its haunting?Really they should have filled more time with the history of It what ever It is rather than chasing the characters from one scene to the next. What became a thrilling movie became somewhat tedious and exhausting near the middle.The characters dont change. AT ALL. When you read a story or watch a movie or show you have to expect that the characters grow and learn from their experiences. This movie did not show that at all and instead just kept punishing them for doing something that is biological. With all of this in mind I expected some kind of loophole that they had to be in love to remove the creature from their lives but rather instead of reflecting on their relationships with each other they jump to the next person without any evidence that this thing actually exists. Obvious fodder characters are obvious. One character only really shows up to pass along the creature only for him to drop off the face of the earth completely after a very awkward conversation in the grass. The opening character was obvious in its points to prove that this creature doesnt mess around when it comes to death. Really? Did she have to sit and wait for the thing to kill her?I give this movie a .,horror,cpwdjm9,2,t5_2qh9x

Im pretty sure he was basically like look I know how the industry works its not a big deal. I think he was even asked if he wanted to consult for the film amp he said no because he knew there was no way they were going to make a hr movie with anything even remotely similar to the content of his book.He totally knew what he was doing he made a lot of money off letting them use the title of his book amp also his book sales probably skyrocketed before during amp after the films release.Do I want a badass miniseries produced by HBO thats an actual adaptation of the book? Of course. But Max Brooks was just doing good sound business by signing off on this film without this film there probably wouldnt be nearly as many of us now yammering for a badass miniseries that does justice to the book amp thus were that much closer to actually getting it.PS  Hollywood did NOT ruin the book World War Z. I watched the movie left the theaters amp walked straight to a book store to buy the book. Since the film amp the book were completely separate concepts it was like I was reading a totally different amp fuckin awesome piece of zombie fiction.

4191977,0,t3_38uhsw,I wasnt blown away but was better than anything Ive seen recently other than It Follows.Between the two if I could only recommend one Id have to choose It Follows. I though We Are Still Here had a great momentum that it didnt quite know how to keep up with. I was enthralled in the very beginning I thought the camera work was incredible in the opening but then it seemed the first  minutes ate up their budget because it just became static shots. The performances were pretty wooden but it worked I really liked the characters. My only two complains was the logic of of some characters actions.SPOILERS SPOILERS DO NO READ IF YOU HAVENT SEENSPOILERS SPOILERSWhen Dave I think it was walks into the bar with his wife after shooting that young woman... Thats incredibly stupid. There is literally no reason for that to have happened other than to show hes an evil guy. But the amount of work that now creates to clean that up and everyone must know the young woman... It doesnt make sense and Im surprised no one pointed that out while shooting it. Its the stupidest scene in the movie. Also for plot and pacing people in real life DO NOT state points of plot. You know that every thirty years the house wakes up we  need that family to stay. If a person knows you dont say it no one repeats points like that in reality and its just laziness of not thinking of a more creative way to inform the audience then to have characters repeat things they already know to each other. Last but not least I thought the ending was a bit bullshitty. The whole thing of having the dead family holding hands.. Those who slay together stay together... Its just been so done before. And then they had to have the reunion with... Billy I think it was. It just wasnt necessary. However good notes it got right into it. I was a little surprised at how quickly it took off and although I think it failed to keep that pace I was impressed.

Not just me but others also have taken last to mean the last greatest so granted were arguing a bit of semantics here rather than the literal most recent and also best. I still stand by my original point. IMO the Xeno was the last iconic horror character. If OP meant from recent times then I just dont think theres anything to stand up against it. There seems to be some confusion about how iconic somehow means memorable. Sure AnnabelleJigsaw etc are memorable right now but will they still be memorable as iconic characters in  years time worthy of revisiting over and over again across decades? ,horror,csavasr,1,t5_2qh9x

4581274,0,t1_ct7wemh,What do you consider terrifying? Any films older than Blair Witch? If youve got a specific taste other than that Im sure Ive got some scares for you! I thought It follows was pretty average. Okay concept but just not a scary movie. Would have been better without the teen drama. Heres some movies I found scary a mix of obscureish and wellknown in various subgenres and no particular order  Sinister  A true crime writer moves into the house that the true crime he is writing about happened in. Strangely his wife does not agree. He finds a box of super  movies in the attic that show not only the murder that happened in his house but a string of other murders as well.  Grave Encounters  A ghost hunter type show investigates an abandoned asylum. If the things that creep you out include getting lost impossible geometry surroundings changing and a group of people waiting for sunrise realising theyve been in that asylum for like a week and the sun has not risen yet this is for you.  Yellowbrickroad  This one is probably closes to Blair Witch on this list. Its about a group of friends that investigate a trail in the woods and then cant find their way back. This ruined a genre of music for me and just left me feeling incredibly uneasy similar to Blair Witch. Dark Skies  If youre into very well done alien encounters this is for you. Its a mock documentary that comes off as very real and has some really freaky segments.  The Descent  A group of friends go caving. The cave theyre in doesnt match the cave theyre supposed to be in and they soon find themselves trapped. Claustrophobia wounded people the dark and something seems to be after them in this unexplored cave. Gets a bit hackyslashy towards the end but otherwise really good.  As Above So Below  A very recent one around the same time as It Follows. An archaeologistrelichunter ventures into the catacombs of Paris looking for the philosophers stone. Things get creepy. That is all. ,horror,ct82mmk,3,t5_2qh9x

4590491,0,t1_ct8rdei,You have an excellent point and an interesting perspective.However to play devils advocate I think I can see where their minds are at. Shows like Orange Is The New Black and House of Cards are getting major recognition for netflix. Its put them on the same playing field as traditional cable networks which is a huge leap for an internet streaming service.  years ago it would have been unheard of. So obviously now that theyve developed some winning series that people want to tune in for and more importantly which they legally cannot get elsewhere it makes sense that Netflix wants to develop these properties... as well as find their next big thing. It does make a certain kind of sense from a business perspective.But I would agree that if they sacrifice too much variety by not licensing more outside properties for the sake of original content they may end up with dissatisfied customers....EDIT  For the record I kind of agree with your point. IMHO variety is vital for a streaming service. But Im not gonna lie... OITNB is one of the best new tv series Ive seen in a while... ,horror,ct986p4,1,t5_2qh9x

4782248,0,t3_3gdtzf,Okay i recently watched a low budget Btype movie which I discovered via this sub  SlashersActually pretty decent for a low budget flick. Heavily cheesy at times but definitely entertaining. However some of the acting was a bit shaky at some points and the girl who played Megan the activist chick was severely overacting through a lot of the film.  Nice boobs though. lolI wouldnt say it ruined the film but it definitely detracted a bit and pulled you out of the story. And not to pick on her... she wasnt the only one. Just the most obvious. Usually I can look past a little bad acting. And there are a lot of purposely annoying characters in horror. The kid in Babadook comes to mind. lol ,horror,ctxcce5,1,t5_2qh9x

Everything in each shot is there for a reason...I like trying to figure out why.The characters who mattered had purpose and the side ones were there to amp up the s group of kids thing I think.

I am not easily scared at these attractions but love experiencing them. The ones that typically get me are not the jump scares  other than those random blast of air to the face. Damn those things but the quiet creepy guy that doesnt make a sound or you dont realize hes there right away. One that slowly changes places in a strobe light until hes right up on me. The feeling of suspense is more genuine than the the feeling of oh shit this guys about to axe my face. Hard to pull of it a fast paced haunted attraction but when done properly... Poop pants. Get a full body spandex costume or at least the face mask that blends into a solid color background in the maze and just when people start to realize there is a figure you in the background or in a corner or they are trying to sneak past you tear off your mask quickly inbetween strobes and reveal a rotted face or a monstrous set of gnarly teeth. ,horror,cuk87f4,1,t5_2qh9x

4983128,0,t3_3j5vnd,Ill tell you one that really stuck with me because of the style its filmed in its The Poughkeepsie Tapes. If you want semirealistic this is pretty damn realistic. Its in the style of a documentary about a serial killer who left several hundred VHS tapes behind before he got caught and instead of the entire movie being the found footage on the tapes its shot in the style of a real documentary with all sorts of interviews with people who were involved such as the families of victims forensic specialists who worked on the case and police who worked on it. Along with that it also shows a lot of the gruesome footage the killer left behind. People hail The Blair Witch Project as being a fantastic found footage film. Well Im not too big on it. I think found footage is often unrealistic despite the point of it being to seem more realistic. This however is the most realistic and the best found footage movie I have ever seen. Another Id recommend that is not found footage but is most definitely visually stimulating and disturbing is Mum and Dad but good luck finding it without having to buy or torrent it.TLDR The Poughkeepsie Tapes incredibly realistic fake serial killer documentaryMum and Dad visually stimulating disturbing and will stick in your mind,horror,cumngsv,1,t5_2qh9x

5128064,0,t3_3l8hzz,If you can handle A Nightmare on Elm Street then you can handle most slasher films.  It is basically a supernatural slasher film.  Copying a post with advice I gave to someone else who asked about this There are a number of ways to do this but I too recommend starting with the classics  before working your way up to some of the more inventive or genre defying films. So I would say take it by decade and see how it progresses. Starting in the s you have Rosemarys Baby Night of the Living Dead and The Haunting. Moving into the s you should try The Exorcist Halloween Texas Chainsaw Massacre Dawn of the Dead Carrie The Omen Jaws Last House on the Left The Wicker Man...and there are some others in fact probably plenty of others like Amityville Horror. Now with the s you have just...lots. And lots of crap too. A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the th are required watching to make sense of how the genre is going to change and unfold over the next twenty plus years. Then you have The Shining The Howling Pumpkinhead Near Dark Aliens Predator The Hunger The Fly Fright Night The Thing Evil Dead  you will be very much reminded of Evil Dead Poltergeist Childs Play Videodrome and of course various sequels to the other franchises particularly I think the next two Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the th films. Moving on to the s Scream which you will have a much better time appreciating Candyman Silence of the Lambs In the Mouth of Madness Ravenous Sixth Sense The Faculty Mimic The Craft The Ninth Gate Interview with the Vampire Bram Stokers Dracula Sleepy Hollow and assorted continuations of existing franchises in particular I would recommend Freddys Dead and Wes Cravens New Nightmare as well as finishing out the Scream trilogy. Then moving into the Aughtss The Ring Dawn of the Dead reimagined version  Days Later Ginger Snaps Pans Labyrinth Paranormal Activity Slither Open Water Signs The Village Shaun of the Dead The Descent Saw Final Destination Jeepers Creepers Trick R Treat The Mist The House of the Devil Cloverfield The Others  Days of Night and many more. I am only including movies that I have seen and I didnt really like all of them but they were important parts of the development of the genre over the last forty years or so. Ive watched plenty of other cult favorites and theres the whole Japanese horror explosion that Ive avoided discussing here except for the American versions like The Ring. But when thinking about the films that helped generate and inspire the next waves of horror these are the ones that come to mind. In more recent years I would say Scream  Let the Right One InLet Me In both versions Cabin in the Woods VHS Sinister Lords of Salem Dont Be Afraid of the Dark The Crazies Black Swan The Inkeepers American Mary The Last Exorcism Black Death Predators Prometheus Troll Hunter The Purge Starry Eyes and last but definitely not least It Follows. The truly genre bendingreinventing films to me are Cabin in the Woods and It Follows. And you really cant appreciate them until after seeing what inspired them. This isnt an exhaustive list Ive left out entire seriesfranchises that Ive not yet sampled i.e. Hellraiser Rec Human Centipede continuations of some of the above and others. But if you like films then you probably like seeing how horror progresses over time. What the constants are and what the truly experimental and interesting films are. And youve touched on three already that were experimental and genre defining Blair Witch ushered in the modern found footage films Alien has spawned its own franchise crossovers and imitators both for the actual storyline and ideas and designs as well as the atmosphere and Evil Dead has been massively influential Cabin in the Woods is deeply indebted to it as are lesser known films like Eli Roths Cabin Fever. Once you start sampling you will also get a taste for what you like and what you dont like including who you like and who you dont like. Enjoy. Being a newbie in this area is great in my opinion. ,horror,cv44h0f,10,t5_2qh9x

5329942,0,t1_cvsutnp,I love the first one beyond reason.The only thing about the second that I really enjoyed was the opening sequence. The plot behind it was less than Id hoped. No military personnel guarding the carrier of the virus? Maintenance guy has access to a new sector of security that only military officials can access? Guy knows about the virus and transmission still exchanges saliva? Growling yelling bloody guy charges military and they just stand there watching him run closer and closer until he kills them one after another? No cameras in the area containing the infected prisoner? Come the fuck on. Then pops is the only one shown in the series to intentionally go after specific people for the entirety of the story. I like the movie but there wasnt a more plausible way to have the outbreak other than making the entire organization and community forget what the infection is for the duration of the carriers presence with them? They should have been terrified and taking more precautions not deciding now is the best possible time to stop caring.Not that the first was without its issues either. Desperate to repopulate the earth after  month? Everything up to that was good and the result of that mentality was good. The mentality existing as such was a bit of a stretch though.

The musics great the visuals are great and its just a lot of fun exploring caves and treasure with the gang of friends.Id say its kidappropriate there are some dangerous moments light spoilers? one kid gets kidnapped by the baddies who Im pretty sure have guns there are skeletons in some sequences.

Seriously its great to work with others or alone...as Jason can and will show up whenever to fuck your dayplans up. The fun part is he gets harder as time goes along.

There is no corner Im in. You have a different understanding of believable. Im looking for entertainment in horror not believability because that is something I will personally never find. If I can suspend belief enough to enjoy demons on the screen I can do the same for people handling irrational situations irrationally.

5701862,0,t1_cx1qa9f,We saw in the nd one how the government ensures Purge night will always go off with a bang but Ill take a stab at these.. No.  If you murder someone during Purge night youre also not held accountable for their death.  You hold no responsibilities for crimes you commit during that night.  The mother might get her brothers together and hunt you down every subsequent Purge until you offer some support though.. Yes.  Banks are locked down and heavily guarded during the Purge though and even if you made it through the highly trained security force youd most likely get gunned down by the government on the way out.. No its still a stolen car.  You wont be charged for stealing it but you could be charged for driving a stolen vehicle if youre still in it after Purge night.  Most likely scenario is the guy you stole from simply gets his car back and then comes to murder you during the next Purge.. No.  If you held a gun to the owners during Purge night and had them sign the deeds over that might work though.. The governmenthired goons driving around in trucks with light machine guns aimed out of the back.

Night of the Living dead is well known enough that a movie making fun of it can be understood without having to see the original. Plus theyre not super scary due to the humor. Shaun of the Dead is another fun flick that still manages to be dark. Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness for sure. The first Resident Evil and Silent Hill movies are great too. AlsoFright Night.  If they wanted something a little more horrific Id go with Poltergeist. Event Horizon and House on Haunted Hill the remake are fantastic films too.

At the time I feel like the space thing hadnt been done to death quite yet so the atmosphere was fairly claustrophobic and selfcontained. The body count was pretty damn high for a  minute movie with Jason taking out a dozen coeds and two groups of soldiers. And most of the kills were pretty creative. The ice head smash the sleeping bag bash the chick getting sucked into space the other chick killing herself and more. There was even a semibelievable backstory about the government wanting to find out and harness why Jason was so unstoppable that if fleshed out would have given the movie a pretty solid plot in the past and future times. And thats really all I look for from a slasher pretty people dying in unique ways.Now for what it had going against it I honestly dont think it was that bad. The two glaring errors I see are the tone and the scientific accuracy. There were just too many puns and if anybody deserves the overserious treatment that so many horror films get today its Jason. Second the science could have been tightened up a little bit even for a scifi movie. The glaring example being when Uber Jason gets blown away from half the ship he somehow just manages to change his trajectory to get back on and its pretty common knowledge that cant be done.The rest of it I feel was pretty solid. The effects were good the jumps were there. I think this movie gets some unnecessary hate.And I totally stand by this. I think it is a very fun movie that could have pretty easily been a great movie!,horror,cxr5g31,3,t5_2qh9x

Its a good movie absolutely fantastic creature effects perfect atmosphere and winter effects and I love that its doing its own thing!

Interesting note that originally the shark was to be featured much more but it malfunctioned constantly and so they were unable to shoot it as much as they wanted. Turned out to really make the movie and added suspense and made the scenes when you saw the shark that much better. Unfortunately I recently read an article where Speilberg discussed remaking Jaws. This would be such a disaster the original is close to perfect and I cant see how a remake would add anything to it. ,horror,cyd4l07,3,t5_2qh9x

6175631,0,t3_3zyseg,I really enjoyed the setting and the wide shots of the forest. Honestly I wish there had been less close up of the leads so even more of the forest could be seen.The scares were decent especially in the frost cave.  However and this seems to be a trend in horror the scenes occurring outside the forest often carried a similar tone not the dream sequences as some of the more sinister moments. This took away the unique atmosphere in the forest itself. If the world outside the forest is just as scary as the forest then what makes the forest so special?My main critique would be Natalie Dormer as Sara and Jess. While some scenes at the end showed she could build her dread and intensity on camera she seemed very wooden throughout most of the film.  There is an inherent issue with having to work for chemistry between yourself and yourself but there was little chemistry her with either Rob or Aiden as well.  I would rank this as a . Also the search engine Sara uses is called Tree.com? That seems a bit weird. ,horror,cyrlt7r,1,t5_2qh9x

Thats why a lot of his short stories are my favorites.    Hell Maximum Overdrive was a short.  The stories that stick in peoples heads are usually short stories that come from him.  Cats eye Monkey shines and Night Shift are all full of stuff that haunted people for their lives.  My  year old sister is still terrified of rats due to the latter.    Its just that he pales in comparison to his son at this point for the actual novels.  His son wrote Lock and Key and Nosferatu.  One is a Lovecraftian comic the other is a branching out of The Black house. and The Talisman.  It also opens up worlds that were formerly held by the villains until now.

As Mitsuko escapes she is recaptured and finally deemed ready to mate with their male creators young version.

He grew up in New England among those old forests and the regions history and he was terrified of witches. He found them horrific and perhaps created a movie that reflected those childhood fears.

6829788,0,t1_d0qe335,How much evil can a baby do? How much evil can a toddler or kindergartener do? Well Kevin intentionally destroyed something his mother cared about very much her study. If it was just pure ignorance of its significance  him being  years old at the time then it would be nothing. The problem is that he only decided to destroy it when she  explained its significance to him. Thats a strange reaction at that age. Another red flag was that she tried to explain its significance to him by appealing to empathy. She said something along the lines of It is special because it shows my personality. Dont you want your room to be special to you by showing your personality? His response? He angrily said I have no personality. Is that normal? Later in the film you see that even as a teenager his room is sanitized and as generic as a model house showroom. No real hints of personality or interest. Who stopped him from cultivating that? His mother?Another red flag to me was that the film briefly showed that he had a potty training problem even to the point of having to still wear diapers despite being old enough to control himself. It is later shown that his potty training issues is linked with his refusal to show any educational progress to his mother except when to spite her.  He intentionally soils himself and wastes her time specifically to spite her.  Is that normal too for a child his age? I agree that she is a flawed selfish person. But I do believe that Kevin was written as having a possibly organic disorder. Even his sister never showed signs like he did despite the fact that his mother equally did not want her. Her daughter just happened to not create a feedback loop of frustration and abuse with her when she was a child  unlike Kevin. EDIT,horror,d0qggf7,3,t5_2qh9x

That lasted up until Hell Money which has to do with Chinese mafia and people being put in an incinerator. Guess what I was afraid of for awhile afterwards?There was also one with invisible animals causing havoc that really distressed me when I saw it but I dont  remember why its just one of the few that stuck out in my head from watching it on broadcast. Also the one with the guy where he finds a dead girl in the back of a bowling lane then goes outside and shes also there. For whatever reason Petes Dragon scared the hell out of me as a kid. I dont remember why or what it was but I was terrified of it and refused to watch it for a long time. What was really ....eerie? I guess or just odd but me and my best friend were talking about movies that had frightened us as children and I was like I know its a kids movie and everyone loves it but Petes Dragon scared me really badly as a kid. I dont remember why but I have an aversion to it even now  years later. He was like ...are you serious? Me too. I saw it as a kid and something about it really disturbed me but I cant remember what.

7084252,0,t3_4chd9n,I just think the whole idea of basing the merits of a horror movie on whether or not it is scary is such backwards childish thinking that I cant comprehend. Like I mentioned in a different topic how does an adult get scared of a movie? Unless there is something wrong with you as an adult youre supposed to be able to differentiate reality from fiction. So ideally watching a movie means you know that it is fiction and its not real and cannot harm you. So how can that scare you? Really people who use this argument please explain this to me because I dont get it.I say this as someone who loves the horror genre and has since I was a child. But I dont think I have been scared of a movie since I was like  years old watching the Nightmare on Elm St. movies. As an adult I appreciate horror differently. I can place myself in a what if scenario and get lost in the world if its done well. I can sympathize with the person living in a haunted house or the person being tortured or the person going down a figurative or literal rabbit hole and uncovering this disturbing world from which there is no escape. Those to me are the marks of great horror. Not because as a  year old adult man some monster jumped out and went boogy boogy! and I went peepee in my pants. Thats ridiculous.Its thinking like this that knocks horror down and makes people not respect it like other genres. Because the people who think that horror needs to be scary or else it sucks watch something and go didnt shit my pants! Booo! Bad movie! What a disservice to the genre. Maybe those people just lack the depth to be able to dissect something and look at it from the viewpoint of being in the movie and just take it at face value because ha ha noises! Maybe the problem is with you not horror.,horror,d1jd73x,1,t5_2qh9x

For a good psychological thriller Donnie Darko is excellent!

But for both of these movies I always gotta ask why dont the victims just make a run for it into the woods first chance they get?  Dont stop running until you find safety.  When the killer was getting choked out woulda been a good chance.I do like the fact that we dont know the killers motive.  It was like that chilling line in the Strangers because you were home. And yes I agree with most on here about the killer taking his mask off way too early.

7665383,0,t3_4kaq4l,April Fools Day  An s slasher movie that thinks outside the box. There is almost no gore but the fun of April Fools Day is the chemistry the cast has and the sense of mystery that the filmmakers created. This is one of the few s horrors that did something different and was basically an early satire of the genre.House By The Cemetery Not one of Fulcis finer moments it is pretty dull until the last act. The dubbing is atrocious. I guess Im a Dario Argento fan first and foremost so these Fulci movies dont impress me quite as much.Possession Ive heard such great things but it didnt do anything for me. It was way too long for this type of movie. I dont mind surreal horror but it seemed like it would never end. Sam Neill was the highlight of this movie.Tourist Trap An awful Texas Chainsaw Massacre type of movie that has some weird comedic undertones. Tanya Roberts is the only interesting thing about this movie.Creepshow They can keep trying to make new anthology films but none will ever be as good as Creepshow. Although the Stephen King segment and the final segment are my least favorite. I think it would be cool to create a hybrid of Creepshow  amp  and replace those two segments with the Hitchhiker and The Lake segments from part .The Mangler Not even Robert Englund and Ted Levine can save this movie. This has some of the worst pacing problems I have ever seen. But I have nostalgia for it because it was the first horror movie I saw in theaters.Oculus This is like a bigbudget Amityville A New Generation.Hardware  A really great postapocalypticcyberpunk thriller.

Even the absolute worst films of the s had some FX work to appreciate  whether it be the sculpting the camera placement the blood gags the delivery or something. Nowadays a number of people think that hiding errors with something they whipped up in Blender will solve all their problems.  It makes things more obvious rather than disguising limitations.And there have been good uses of oldschool techniques of late so the trend isnt wholly omnipresent.gt The percentage of quality to garbage may have gone down a bit because there are less hoops you have to jump through to get something releasedYouTube and other hosting services are a godsend for the genre.

8146303,0,t1_d4vseq1,SPOILERS for anyone else reading this who hasnt seen the movie or read the booksSo the Dark Tower Flagg CK etc are referenced mostly in very subtle ways but some of them are very significant. The most obvious and least important one is that at the beginning the piece of art being created is a movie poster featuring Roland the tower and roses. Im pretty sure that poster only exists to tell fans to pay attention to clues.The most important one is when the religious woman whos starting to freak out says to an entity we dont see my life for you which is what the trashcan man says to Randal Flagg and what Flagg in turn asks other characters to say later on to pledge themselves to him and the Crimson King. Remember that someone says that the mist started coming from a military base and that the scientists at the base were trying to open a window to another world or something along those lines. So when we establish that a character is pledging themselves to Flagg and CK we can then assume that they are behind this intentional or otherwise or at least involved somehow. So this would mean that in trying to open a window to a new world most likely they created a thinny or a doorway that doesnt lead to another world but to Todash space. The creatures from the movie match the description of the creatures of Todash space as does the mist. So now you have  antagonists in the story that are never seen or mentioned you know what theyve done you know that theyve probably done it in order to do something relating to the tower or to a beam and you know what the creatures are and where they come from. TLDR If you havent read the books or dont remember them The Mist just features some kind of accident wherein creatures from another dimension come into our world through this mist. If you have read the books then you can figure out that Randall Flagg probably in service to the Crimson King has ripped open a thinny leading to the creatures of Todash space escaping into our world. ,horror,d4vu1sp,9,t5_2qh9x

8368340,0,t3_4u0flx,Saw it last night really enjoyed it. The first two acts I just sat there thinking ok this is pretty good but I wasnt blown away. And then by the point the third act hit and all the lights in the house went out the movie became so much more intense. Without even realizing it I had become so invested in all of these characters and thats when I realized where all the praise for this movie was coming from. My biggest issues with the movie came from the script and how expository it could be at times. There were a few scenes that just felt kinda like they were forcefeeding the audience information when there were probably better ways to reveal these things. Another small gripe I had was the fact that we saw Diana under blacklight. IMO she was way more frightening as a silhouette. But overall I think this movie did way more good than bad and was definitely one of the more emotionally driven horror films Ive seen in a while. Its impressive that an entire film based around what could be easily considered a gimmick never felt lazy when utilizing that technique. Definitely something Id watch again. So props to udauid for making a solid first feature film! ,horror,d5nlcxi,17,t5_2qh9x

It was just about interesting enough to hold my attention until the end but I found it generally too slow and boring. Most of the characters were obnoxious and the dialogue was fairly terrible as well as the acting. Even though it was clear from the start that at least one person was going to die I never felt any sense of real danger for them and nothing that really creeped me out. There were a few good ideas and I though the general premise of the ghosts was pretty good but the whole thing just seemed poorly executed.

8847041,0,t1_d7ba1tl,Excellent criteria.I would add one fatalism. There is a sense that things are moving towards some inevitable terrible end and that actions taken to prevent it may change the details but not prevent the tragedy  and may well cause or exacerbate it. I suppose this is part of the oppressive atmosphere. The feeling that the only choices are evils and lesser evils. Even if the monster or threat is defeated in the end the feeling persists throughout.Just the very act of labeling something horror plants that seed in the back of the audiences minds leading to a case of dramatic irony. Sometimes this is subverted that trip out to the isolated cabin or haunted asylum actually turns out not to be the worst idea in the history of bad ideas. But I think its hard to create effective horror without any lingering sense of fatalism.,horror,d7baelg,3,t5_2qh9x

8926402,0,t1_d7joya1,It is certainly true that cosmic horror is incredibly difficult to capture in a visual medium. Any eldritch being seen by the audience immediately destroys any believability as to its madnessinducing power and the challenge of keeping such beings in shadow while giving tantalizing glimpses is immense. The world of those games should be becoming of Lovecrafts gothic and eldritch legacy something also difficult due to the stringent requirements of isolation paranoia and building disease. I believe that a Lovecraftian video game should be largely actionless instead focusing on a supreme helplessness and hopelessness. Choices given to players create a sense of empowerment and selfdetermination Cosmicism calls for a pressing predeterminism. The world of the cosmic is built upon a gradual or brief piercing revelation that humanity is truly animalistic and helpless in the face of the stars.The defeat of an apparent abomination only for this being to be revealed as a single cell within something much greater would fittingly create this existential terror. The confounding of a player by such twists and turns followed by the revelation that these choices were completely irrelevant might also create suitable despair.Silent Hill creates that feeling of maddening revelation a deranged cult intends to rebirth their god through a human child. Possession cosmic mystery and even the gothic pervade the series. Indeed an alternate ending involves an alien abduction.Silent Hill Two also conveys a powerful sense of the Outside and psychological torment. The bleakness of these pieces truly contributes to a sense of a Lovecraftian universe linked by pieces of a puzzle we dare not ponder in its entirety. ,horror,d7ktlyf,1,t5_2qh9x

Rather it just showed that the kid was messed up even as a kid.  He lived a normal but crappy life beforehand.  His murderous intent was there long before he killed the family.  The evil started to slip out and he started killing people that pissed him off.  Then it turned into killing anybody that was there and in his way.  Do we know why?  Nope.  Sure its not as mysterious as the original but I felt like it had a much more emotional impact within the story.  The mom sees her son become consumed by evil and turn into a monster and at the very end the only person he actually loved supposedly kills him.  of course the sequel shows that he wasnt killed but I pretend that it doesnt exist.  All of the white trash stuff could have been taken out though and we would have had an even better movie.,horror,d811lwd,11,t5_2qh9x

It is similar to VHS in that it is an anthology horror film but I dont know if VHS does this or not it intertwines each separate story so much so that in certain scenes you will see other characters in the background at the halloween parade and the werewolf scene to be specific and it all takes place in one place on Halloween night. It is sort of like that movie Crash if youve ever seen that. Plus I love how each separate story is a different Halloweeen experience for example the child and the father carving the jackolantern the older kids trick r treating and playing pranks the adult side of halloween when things get sexy and then the old guy at the end is sort of the Scrooge of halloween. Its awesome. I could go on forever about this movie lol. Anyways go into it with an open mind and lowered expectations and you might enjoy it more.

9203649,0,t3_56e4tq,I am incredibly excited for this and have been for a few years. My main concern is that the film will tank regardless of how good it actually is because people are so hung up on Tim Curry that they wont even give this new one a chance. I love the  adaptation but I know just how much of that is nostalgia. IT was my first real foray into horror and is largely responsible for me loving the genre. I rewatch it every now and then and the recently released Blu ray is currently on its way to me from Amazon but Im aware that it just simply is not a good miniseries. The acting from the adults involved is just plain bad and the complete lack of swearing gore or any real violence is kinda jarring once you notice it. Its just too... clean. Its even worse if you have read the book as well knowing how much better the full story is. If you detach yourself from the nostalgia youll see it will be difficult for the new film to not be an improvement.Ive only seen Bill Skarsgrd in Hemlock Grove which was a mediocre show at best. Regardless I very much enjoyed his performance in it and have no concerns about his casting as Pennywise. Like uHoustonsSolution mentioned there is no point comparing the two Pennywises.A lot of people are shitting on the costume based on one promo shot. What seems to be forgotten is the fact that they arent just going to show a regular looking friendly clown for the photo. Its a promo pic for a horror movie so of course its going to look Spooky. All of the promotional stuff is going to be of the same much like all horror promos these days. I urge and encourage everyone to approach the film with an open mind. Lets wait to see Pennywise in pleasant mode before condemning him as a failed attempt to be scary.Having just finished watching Stranger Things Im also excited for the fact that Finn Wolfhard Mike Wheeler has been cast as Richie Tozier. The kid is likeable and can act well which is obviously a concern people would have for a film that is so focused on the children as the main characters. I havent seen the other kids in anything so cant speak for their performances but Wolfhard and Skarsgrd make me comfortable with their casting choices so far.I havent yet seen Mama but I remember it getting relatively positive reviews with regard to the directing. A quick look on Wikipedia suggest IT is only going to be Muschiettis second film as director so its probably a bit unfair to be so concerned over his only other film so far.Either way I will be there at the earliest session I can when it is released and hopefully I will be making return trips if it is as good as I feel its going to be.,horror,d8imppv,2,t5_2qh9x

The killer kid and demon wife scenes in particular felt like they could have been very creepy were they better fleshed out and given room to breathe. Its only potentially worth it for  segments and even then your mileage may vary Id predict leaning towards the unimpressed in more cases. The rest are noticeably unpolished at best or completely trite at worst hard to recommend even for cheese value. Theres a tired retelling of The Ransom of Red Chief at one point and a slasher segment at another that tries really poorly to get its audience to laugh... with a random alien swerve. Even one of the more interesting premises in the film an escalating feud between two haunted house managers feels terribly awkward due to the pace it has to develop at.Id give it a .. Darren Lynn Bousmans segment gives it at least one story that feels clever and wellpaced and two or three others have enough charm and Halloween feel to partially compensate for the multiple misfires.

I guess there is a big difference between found footage and handheld cam movies thoughBeing a little more broad and treating all these movies as found footage even though yes some are handheld not found Id complete your list with The Visit The Taking of Deborah Logan I have mixed feelings about this one but its an interesting watch The Last Exorcism The Bay love this one I totally recommend it The Cutting Room and The Den these last two are divisive but I personally enjoy both for their subtle addition to the genre which I always enjoy when a movie takes a formula and adds some subtle thing to it in a good way like The Witch and the arcaic english makes the film feel unique even though its using well known formulas. ,horror,d8vujqx,1,t5_2qh9x
9313058,0,t1_d8w4thf,That was my next point  its cheap to make because of the filming method.

9416265,0,t3_59k9xe,My opinion on the Childs Play series is never very popular but of the modern Chucky movies I liked Seed the best followed by Curse with Bride far behind in third. Bride was the worst kind of s metahorror that thought being selfreferential was all that was needed to be clever. Seed went in a weird new place but it was interesting and genuinely charming and funny in addition to having some good kills.Curse just felt safe like they realized that audiences felt they deviated too far from their roots with Seed and they just went back to the darker tone of the first couple of movies but they didnt really do anything fresh with it. It just felt like everything in Curse had been done before and for the most part done better. It was certainly passable and makes for a decent entry in the series but personally Im waiting to hear more of the story of GlenGlenda.,horror,d99ksap,1,t5_2qh9x

9560982,0,t3_5bq665,Okay this is what annoys me. The second anyone says they didnt like a movie like this one thats considered artsy immediately the comments are filled with people suggesting that its because I prefer mainstream theatrically released Hollywood films. I specifically said that the vast majority of my favorite horror movies are the creepy ones not the in your face jumpscares. Babadook was without a doubt my favorite horror movie from last year and one of my favorites ever and I recently watched It Follows and really liked that as well even though I wasnt expecting to.There seems to be this odd assumption that if someone doesnt like an artsy movie its because they arent intelligent enough to get it and clearly only like mainstream films.Im not saying that The Witch was a bad movie or that it wasnt scary enough or that there wasnt enough blood and guts and scary ghosts. Im saying that I found the plot to be lackluster.You can agree with me or disagree with me thats fine. That was the point of making the post was to get the opinions of others.

This means that the horror movies I enjoy nowadays are either campy enough to be funny or just well made movies regardless of genre.My viewing of horror took a similar trajectory to yours I started off getting scared by a movie when I was a little kid and then dove off the deep end trying to desensitize myself. Like you I was successful.  I also found a genre with just as much to offer as any other in terms of variety of storytelling.  Of my top  favorite movies Id call at least  of them horror and none of them scared me when I saw them.  I like them because they are creative engaging and films I can watch over and over again finding something new to appreciate each time.

10012650,0,t1_dbcnnbg,The original is actually an important film. It was one of the first modern splatter movies take on some pretty heavy themes while still being a thoroughly manic mindfuck. It used things like meat eating ie cannibalism corpse defiling and systematic slaughter to really call into question just what humanity and by extension life itself really is. Are we just vessels destined for consumption? To become food and costumes like other animals? What lies at the core of our humanity? What gives it inherent value? In the end Sally learns that the only way her life had any value was to fight for it at all costs.It also examines the ins and outs of a kind of domestic xenophobia if that makes sense and how it applies to the post hippie generation. These naive kids wandered into the black hole of the Texas wilderness in their van all jaded and spoiled and minimally charmed by the novelties of the country only to have reality come along and seriously fuck them up. They even trusted the badge on the policemans chest as if they were able to take refuge in his authority not realizing that there could be that very same crazy in the person wearing it. This went on to be a common horror trope but back in  it was still fresh considering that hitchhiking culture and suburban sprawl was still in full swing.Much like The Hills Have Eyes TCM shows us that theres still some deep rooted pockets of tribal crazy out there. America is a big and fucked up place filled with all types.

10262798,0,t3_5mynom,I think it could be done as a psychological horror rather than a slasher set before Jasons death. The s setting would be pretty unique among modern films and then you could focus on the idea of curses and perhaps leave many details ambiguous  a general undercurrent of wrongness at the camp some weird events in the lake and woods lots of foreshadowing perhaps uncertainty about whether Pamela Voorhees is mentally well to start with and eventually leading up to the death of Jason. Kind of like a Pet Semetary feel with there being something inherently wrong about the place where the camp was built and something that lives there demanding a sacrifice every so often.I dont know maybe the change in tone would be too jarring considering that the franchise also includes the likes of Jason X but I would be cautiously interested in seeing something more serious in tone that focuses on the idea of curses and bad luck.,horror,dc7ce7q,12,t5_2qh9x

There are hacky jump scares oh it was only the cat and genuine jump scares that fit with the tone and the situation Jack is somewhere in the hotel and we are waiting for him to attack. To say there are no jump scares in The Shinning is silly. Especially since much of the film is about the tension between eerie tone and the sudden scares those twin girls appearing after watching Billy ride his bike around those hallways for awhile nearly killed me.,horror,dcamvib,2,t5_2qh9x

10383266,0,t3_5og1i6,I liked it. Was this her first effort at making a short? It didnt feel like it when watching.Suggestions are mostly technical.... Incongruent lighting. I would recommend that the filmmaker pay attention to color temps when using lights and setting white balance. Lighting and color help define a films mood so it is important to keep lighting themes consistent. This was kind of all over the place mood wise.. Some shots were under lit. Key light back light  and fill light for subjects such as people. The trick is to do it so it doesnt look like you are lighting an interview. It helps provide definition. Also its better to do it as bright as you can without clipping highlights. In post ou can lower exposure. If you have to boost exposure in post you will magnify sensor noise. . If you cant control color temps with the lighting shoot in black and white and eliminate the problem. Its also a good way to learn more about lighting.. Always invest in great sound.. Get creative with editing. Speed of cuts controls pacing. Think of it as a roller coaster. You want lows and highs. ,horror,dcl09yb,1,t5_2qh9x

10647684,0,t1_dda9iqc,I think its that hes been very ill.  I dont want to give him too hard a time but I believe he ended up in a coma and it had a serious effect on him.  He didnt have a lot of energy and likely was having some cognitive issues that were making writing difficult.  Im sure he wanted to get it out and thought that a cowriter could help him get it out the door.  I remember reading years ago how his assistant was editing and compiling it and Id put oddson there was still a lot of work to do so his assistant just finished it.  Purely my own speculation but I think you can really see the writing that is Barker and the writing that is not.

10708493,0,t3_5t5dqg,I took a writing class over the summer at a college during my Junior year of high school. Because it was a summer class and none of the students had it as part of any higher education curriculum schedule the professor wasnt able to assign a reading list. Instead she stuck to discussing the topics of the class then wed get together after class some evenings to watch films which emphasized those topics.We watched Psycho after we spent an entire class discussing the proper use of pacing because that film takes it time slowly building tension. Then in a single scene it accelerates from eerie subtly to a full on death scene which at the time contradicted the audiences opinion of what was proper. We take a lot of that film for granted now because so much has changed but at the time that shower death scene was breaking all the rules.Later one we watched John Carpenters The Thing after reading the short story which was the original source material for the film. We watched it because it emphasizes the concept of the actors secret which is basically just a character backstory which only the actorwriter knows and is never communicated to the audience. She pointed out how we dont really know every characters role at the research station but we dont need to. Theres no scene where the characters are taking a break and discussing their private lives to change the pace. Their backstories arent important to the plot and while most people would say youd need to communicate some sort of backstory to the audience to get them to empathize with the characters it works just fine in this film without any of that. Their character traits are backstory enough so the film doesnt have to waste time with the characters unnecessary selfexposition. Instead the film performs a pace change by alternating back and forth between moments where the threat is obvious when the thing is attacking and moments where the threat is unknown and the characters are suspicious of one another.,horror,ddki1gm,1,t5_2qh9x

What can one consider patently gratuitous that someone else doesnt find some sort of meaning in? Many oldguard critics would scoff at a film like Return of the Living Dead for being trashy schlock but thats exactly why I love the movie. Its trashy fun. I think its just too hard to actually pin something down and say that it is gratuitous for the sake of being so. Even films like Cannibal Holocaust or Mondo Cane have merit Id say. Even if they were made just to shock they are of note because theyre pieces of film history that give us a window into a subgenre of horror that is both of historical and cultural importance just as German Expressionism or Cold Warera science fictionhorror is culturally and historically important.,horror,ddpkpft,3,t5_2qh9x

But believe me it falls so far below the threshold of good horror its undisputable.This reminds me of failed press conferences that are then evaluated as a success by a supporters. In that case they say its a perfect example of being real and American even if there are blatant lies incoherent logic and complete ignorance of intel. In this case reviewers are latching on to the idea that this is a feminist horror film made be women filmmakers who are festival darlings.It doesnt matter! This is like a sequence of undergrad film school projects. Even the stopmotion stylized throughline connecting sequence has been done with far better taste and technique. This was pale imitiation weak sauce. The Babadook is so much better a success of this ideal of feminist horror.The first story did have nice cinematography and a nice score though.,horror,ddyxpkz,2,t5_2qh9x

11112086,0,t3_5y9wrv,I agree with the consensus here. Its a shame because for all of the impeccable detail that went into the fantastic look of the film you think the filmmakers maybe would have spent a little more time on the screenplay. I was also on board for the premise but it really goes nowhere. Elaine is interesting for maybe the first act due to her eccentricities but you soon realize that shes a flat onenote caricature who remains mostly arcless until the final scene and by then who cares?.In describing the protagonist Ive also described the entire story really  its a flat onenote narrative that is mostly arcless. Perfunctory scenes are stretched into infinity and do next to nothing to push the story forward no I dont need a ten minute scene of Elaine talking to her fellow witches at a burlesque club about NOTHING.People might hate me for saying this but The Love Witch really might be the horror version of La La Land I use the word horror loosely of course. Both are visually impressive The Love Witch being more impressive extremely lowstakes s retro revivalist movies featuring thin caricatures and dont have much to actually say. Sorry but I need more food for thought than Gee whiz doesnt love make us do crazy things?. This applies to both films.To be fair I did enjoy some moments.

Good jump scares are hard to do. Scream didnt have good jump scares. They used the DUN DUN sound effect to make them scarier. Due to the films success studios started making films targeted to a teen demographic. Then when it got harder for teens to get into an R rated film they cut the films down and made them PG.

Honestly the practical effects alone were enough to win me over. Add the spoilers end of death  ushering in of a new era concept along with the body horror elements and apocalyptic atmosphere and the film had me sold. The execution definitely wasnt perfect the lack of a solid story didnt bother me much but the characters had some very unbelievable interactions spoilers the bearded guy was ready to chop off the sheriffs head then he was ready to help the sheriff get his shotgun under the condition that he gets to keep it then when the sheriff tells him hes keeping it the dude doesnt protest at all? wtf was up with that?

11652012,0,t3_6688v2,Scream is the horror movie that sparked my love of the genre. I saw it at a midnight screening at the now defunct Cinedome theatre in Riverdale Utah. I think most of the crowd had seen it a time or two before. The audience laughed screamed and cat called. I dont think Ive ever had as much fun at a movie as I did seeing Scream. The only experience that comes close was the opening weekend for Grind House or the first year of the After Dark Film Festival.What bums me out in recent years fans of horror have decided to start slamming the series. Its my opinion that those who would make a point of trying to play down the first film are being entirely disingenuous. Scream was a classic the moment it debuted. It helped reinvigorate the genre. Sure as a whole the series is uneven. The original is a perfect horror film imo. The second being the weakest in the series was one of the first movies to really deal with plot leaks on the internet. The original script before the rewrites due to the leak was much stronger. ,horror,dggrq4u,5,t5_2qh9x
11652484,0,t3_6663vz,Eh  I rewatch The Thing like twice a year going on  years now. I saw The Void at a screening and was left a bit disappointed. To me it didnt do enough and there was basically no point in the movie where they focused on the practical effects themselves to show off the FX. To really say its body horror and Thingesque they could have put more camera time on the monsters and not in dark flashy light rooms.The biggest surprise and enjoyment was the fact a hero character was in there. The wise cracks and balls on the guy was more MacReady than the filming was to the Thing. With that said fuck yeah I liked it more than a lot of recent shit. I hope we see more of this type of work again. Its been a dead part of the genre for so long its awesome to see it just start up again with this. ,horror,dggtnlm,1,t5_2qh9x

11756295,0,t1_dgrz7e3,Finally an answer. Thank you for this! If youll publish a full review as text or video Id be happy to readview it. Just send a link.As for your input skipping the agreeing parts thank you for this nonethelessgtI saw it as an extension of the above  that she was prim wholesome and had felt safe when everything was just so those complex braids require impossibly fussy neatness and attention to detail.Makes sense. Ill see it that even the slightest disturbance of planned things tripped up Katherine.gtId have to rewatch but my first instinct was just that its a creepy scene to unnerve you with that not right feeling. I got an instant weird vibe about the dynamic between her and her father if that dream had any truth to it.Unnerving und unsettling all the way! Theyre the first few secondsminutes and yet perfectly set up the mood that continues throughout the whole film. Its hard to describe and I cant fit it into a single word  its somewhere around eerie weird dreamy odd.gtAfter Rose mentioned the eyebrows I did pay attention during the dinner scene and noticed they looked filled in with pencil but thats pretty normal. I think it was a red herring  you realise that the sisters werent devilworshippers because otherwise Kat would have spared them. It also helped illustrate how ready Rose was to tease Kat. Stuff that kids do to be mean to each other.Yep red herring fits pretty good.gtI noticed the pauses when she called too. I didnt think it wasnt an answering machine as she didnt have any differences in intonation as you do when youre talking back and forth with someone. It just sounded like someone trying to leave a very long message. Which I remember thinking would bug me because Id have to listen to a secondlong message with basically  words stretched over it. Its possible that she was calling a landline answering machine and waiting for someone to pick up do those things still exist?.Yes it didnt soundfeel like a real conversation one has over the phone. Rather like when a lay actor has to play a phone conversation. Odd undertone. Theres also the possibility nobody picked up on the other side and she pretended the conversation she wouldve liked to have.gtKat does later say that her parents are dead and seems to say so with certainty. Its probably easier for a demon to possess her if she has no family seen in another recent movie but I dont want to spoil it in case youve not seen it. It did seem like her parents were on the way but were mysteriously detained  whereas Rose deliberately delayed her familys arrival. Id bet the car in the beginning was theirs but I cant recall if there was blood or not i.e. if another possessed person murdered them or if it was just an accident.When she said that to Rose it came out dead serious. Like a confession. Not like something with which one comes up to mock their room mate. Her parents felt like they were there and not there at the same time. I think what Perkins was trying to convey here was this kind of ambiguity shortly after a persons death. Theyre also there and not there at the same time fading away more and more until theyre nothing but a memory.I think it was pretty sure the car was that of Katherines family otherwise she wouldnt have shouted Mommy? when she saw it while standing next to probably her father. Also blood is clearly visible on the left side of the cargtI dont know about there not being a physical manifestation but if Rose had seen it she would have reacted. I wouldnt be surprised if only the possessed could see what is possessing them.Ill stick to its all in her head but possessed ones being able to see different things is something I didnt consider yet. Thanks for this idea!Something I forgot in the long post before The title change. Perkins stated in several interviews that it will always be February for him not The Blackcoats Daughter. The Publisher A came up with that name by the way not him. Anyway the only confirmed blackcoat we get to see is Father Brien who doesnt have any daughter and doesnt seem like a fatherly figure for Katherine either. There is however Bill telling Joan about how he finds God not in churches but in unlikely events coincidences. During their little conversation about God Bill is wearing a dark jacket black dress shirt and white tshirt underneath And Bills daughter is Rose. Its strange still because whe whole film is way more about Katherine than it is about Rose. Except Katherines father also iswas a blackcoat.,horror,dgsltav,1,t5_2qh9x
11765245,1,t1_dgtlz55,I suppose to me a metaphor should be a subtle and complex thing. It shouldnt have to bat you over the head because its obvious without being obvious.

I guess its a huge barrier with the subject matter  dummiesdolls and I dont think he treated it with the same pinache the other movies had. Of course all horror concepts border on corny I think he just was able to use auteur vision to overcome that with the other films.

11792265,0,t1_dgwgp8h,gtIts objectively a different film than those that influenced it and even if it was a straightup remake of The Beyond thatd still be a really interesting project.The Void is essentially a retelling of the same story in The Beyond. Both concern two people who are caught up in a supernatural plot started by a warlock using an evil book. The evil plans to bridge the world of the dead with that of the living. The Warlock is murdered and this escalates events. The two humans travel through limbo futilely combating the forces and eventually end up on the Other SideHellThe Darkness where they are trapped. What is objectively different here? Thats way too strong a word to use in defense of The Void. Its not a straight up remake true but it is a nd generation version of the same plot in a game of cinematic Chinese Whispers.It certainly is similar enough to warrant a shout out in the credits which is all Id want from The Void.Something doesnt have to be a word for word copy in every aspect of another work to be considered plagiarism or in my terms a ripoff.  What you incorrectly call pastiche is actually mosaic plagiarism. To put it one way if a horror movies signature moments those things that make it a horror movie are essentially taken directly sceneforscene  from other movies then you have a derivative stealing work. Not some new breath of horror. This work will not add anything back to the genre it will only remind experienced people of better movies while not giving credit so others who dont know about those movies can never find what made The Void bearable to them. gtIve seen all the films you compared it to many times and watched it with other wellversed horror buffs and we all thought it was quite entertaining wellexecuted and a lot of fun. Was it wildly innovative? No but we thought it did a great job of building something distinct and worthwhile out of the sum of its great influences. I cant speak to your tastes but this was a boring boring movie to my group of friends and I but its pointless to try and argue anecdotally about your group of nameless faceless friends who all just loved this pile o crap compared to mine who did not like this pile o crap. Anecdotes are meaningless which is why I showed in my video exactly what was taken.gtLook at something like Army of Darkness  that recreates whole scenes from other films The Road Warrior springs to mindArmy of Darkness in no way resembles The Road Warrior or any of those older movies to the point of plagiarism. If you tried to tell someone Army of Darkness was a ripoff of The Road Warrior youd get a blank stare or a laugh because it isnt apparent from watching or studying both. However if you go look at the immediate reactions and reviews of The Void on rhorror most posts acknowledge the borrowing from The Beyond and Prince of Darkness are pretty obvious. This is because the borrowing is obvious because its done in such a way its not a new creative effort but just plain old stealing and redoing exactly what was done before. It doesnt make people go Oh what a fresh way to use X it just makes them go Ive seen this before.gt and Army of Darkness steals half its jokes from prewar comedy and The Adventures of Baron Von Munchausen and it is overloaded with visual and narrative references to other films.Using old jokes in a loving manner is not the same as just borrowing entire ideasscenes beat for beat and then  claiming to be original. Its one thing for a horror movie to hybridize Stooges humor and make it work its quite another for a bland horror movie to steal scenes to make itself stand out. Ones creative the other isnt. There are enough original elements in Army of Darkness that it doesnt compare to what it borrowed. This is what I meant in my review about swatches of inspiration thrown in little things like the jokes you mentioned in Army of Darkness. Not big ideas plot ideas entire scenes and characters like in The Void.gtIm thrilled to see a new film reinterpret those things because they are great and underseen and underreutilized motifs.  This is the entire point youve missed. Who cares? People who know those classic movies deserve more viewership because of their intrinsic worth. They arent going to get that if someone just steals their ideas and never gives credit where its due. Thats why I made this video to show people what was being borrowed so they can find the true masterpieces as opposed to being mildly entertained by their misuse in this much lesser movie. I dont want to live in a world where people dont appreciate the true works of art because someone mislead them into a dark alley full of cheap digitallyfilmed crappy versions of better movies. We need more The Beyond and Carpenter fans making great works based in what came before but not based solely on taking from their work.gtArt thrives on remixing combining and reinterpreting other ideas  you dont have to like the end product but thats simply the nature of the creative process.This is NOT the nature of a creative process. Its the process of theft and vandalism.gtSkimming through your other posts on the subject you clearly have some sort of vendetta you are pursuing but I think youre seeing malicious intent where there is none.I dont have a vendetta I just love those movies that were borrowed from so much more than I did The Void that I want to be fair and honest to them and their importance.However you seemed to have like the product so much youre willing to give it a pass for its very worrisome handling of other peoples ideas. I think you should give my video another watch and really try to be honest about whats going on here. This isnt the new generation learning from old masters its a hollow moneygrab using someone elses ideas.,horror,dgwoyj9,-2,t5_2qh9x

11801765,0,t1_dgxqrux,Its amazingly well put together for what it is. Usually black and white is just a gimmick but its used absolutely beautifully. The lights and darks are used in such an evocative way.The beauty of the cinematography contrasting with the horrific imagery and ideas makes for such unsettling viewing.,horror,dgxrrku,3,t5_2qh9x

Not only that but the empty ice block in the other room coupled with the music and Kurt Russel and the other actors performance is great. Completely creeps you out not knowing what happened to these people that were so desperate that it would lead someone to commit such a grisly act of suicide.,horror,dgxxe4b,4,t5_2qh9x
