801525,0,t1_cgvcpng,Well that is one way to look at it as far getting yourself killed. Unfortunately it was not a brag but more of a verbal illustration of how an ESTP sees adversity especially in bleak or even unwinnable odds. But now that I have been taken down a notch Probably to equalize your level of feelings and insecurity that are now on display in a public forum... I am severely glad that the  mentality of misguided inferiority complexes can be ever present in setting the world straight. Thank you again for God only knows what I couldve said had I not been brought back down to earth. Hell I was almost getting ready to compare the ESTP to a Godlike mentality but alas...all for not now and we can all sleep better tonight. ,estp,cgvdxi3,2,t5_2tt3a

2884008,0,t3_2t4ynf,Drop as much as you reasonably can from your life use the extra time to reflect on what you wanted to get out of the project what you actually ended up getting both good and bad and why you lost motivation. Take small steps toward new goals for example if you want a car go get your license or if you want to start another business go to a conference or seminar. Use your knowledge of what you enjoyed about your venture to recalibrate and set a new goal. The rest is easy grab opportunities break out of your comfort zone and keep doing you.,estp,cnvwx22,1,t5_2tt3a

5119427,0,t1_cv326o7,I dont hate ESTPs. I said they get a bad rep which they do for being womanizers and so do ESFPs. No need to get bitchy about it. MBTI is not a perfect science its a theory. My emotions arent fucked up theyre just there.,estp,cv32zv9,-1,t5_2tt3a
5165156,0,t1_cv3t93q,I love my brother and will do anything for his success. Hes unaware of the projection and I think most others fall for his charisma.  We are both gift iq but the obvious difference is I do he talks.  By the time I speak its worked out.  We both possess great communication and wit we both can manipulate the conversation.  Im very fact based and confident in confrontation because I only enter fray when Im knowledgeable. On the other hand my brother tends to wing it. This usually works for him in his surroundings.  Myself being surrounded by INTJ utilizing his approach would get me called out quickly.  Not to brag most never challenge or engage me. Bragging ,estp,cv8lcbl,1,t5_2tt3a

6668298,0,t3_46w1tg,To help her focus. Let her move and hyper focus on things. So if she is reading out loud let her pace or walk as she reads. Play some music in the background that has no words just a sick beat. Toss a ball back and forth while talking about the subject at hand. Walking about tossing a ball.. all things that engage the distracted parts of her brain the part that instinctively needs action. While letting the part of her brain that is involved with higher more critical thinking do other things.,estp,d0925ni,1,t5_2tt3a
6930662,0,t1_d11to2c,Haha I know! Its awesome finding people with the same mindset more or less.  I used to kind of think that way about other people.  So many things just come so naturally to us and its pretty much always obvious so when other people dont understand it is incredibly frustrating!  How do you not understand this!  Other people arent stupid though they just have different strengths.  Those that arent problem solving smart might be better at administration things or hospitality things.  We probably wouldnt be to thrilled with those because they sound really boring although you may be and if you are great! but we need people like that because thats how a lot of things get done.For the music thing yeah its just so irritating.  Is it that hard to just keep the conversation going?  I dont know maybe they just arent interested in keeping conversations going.  For all I know my asking him that could have been the most annoying thing in the world to him and if that was his way of ending it so he wasnt annoyed any more oh well.  I dont get it but thats okay because I can just move on to the next fun thing haha,estp,d11wz8w,1,t5_2tt3a

7423058,0,t3_4gyr4o,ESTPs use Ti and so they are notorious for shutting people out. They like to think about things alone unlike ENFPs who use Te and talk out loud. ENFPs can relate to some degree since they do have Fi so they do spend some time alone to develop their sense of self and work through feelings. This is very different from ESTPs though who dont actively work through feelings like you do. In my experience with ESTPs they are full speed ahead when theyre in. The ESTP I married proposed after only a month. They can be really spontaneous thats for sure. However they shy from commitment for awhile or at least what we might consider commitment talking openly about feelings etc. Even NOW I have issues getting my ESTP to talk openly with me. They get there eventually but youll likely see an outside commitment before they even open up really which is pretty opposite of the ENFPs I know who seem to value opening up to one another more and like to see that before committing to someone. So bottom line is... Hes not looking to open up to you right now. He might be evaluating his feelings for you but if he is its not like youd imagine. Hes probably putting it out of his mind right now bc he doesnt want to face it. Sounds like he doesnt want it to be serious between you guys. That could be bc hes just not into you and only wants to hook up or hes just freaked out by that side of himself. ESTPs avoid shit that makes them uncomfortable. So something about this makes him uncomfortable.My advice to you dont hold your breath on this guy. I know its hard for ENFPs to not focus on getting to know someone on this understanding level but trust me he doesnt want what you do. Best way to attract an ESTP is to be not serious. Dont call and ask why he hasnt called you. Pretend you dont even notice that he hasnt. Talk to other guys and do your own thing for awhile. Hell come back around and wanna hang out when he sees you dont care about him not talking to you.  It shows that you really are cool with him having his own space and it shows youre not looking for something serious. Honestly tho by then you might have moved on lol. Bc honestly I dont know if he can really make you happy. Good luck! ,estp,d2lybq7,5,t5_2tt3a

ESTPs shamelessly joke about a damsel unless there is actual trouble brewing and needed to step in to take action.   ,estp,d3h5td6,1,t5_2tt3a

10198757,0,t3_5m1kuw,. Document Table of ContentsStructureampnbspampnbspSurvey ResponsesThe raw survey responses  selfexplanatory hopefully!. Contains filters for the purposes of debugging as well as examining data not organized into one of the other tabs of the document.ampnbspampnbspOverview in the works as of Gives an overview of Gender Type Socionics and Temperament survey results. Includes a vast majority of the charts on the document charts not readily available on Google Sheets version  import from xlsx wasnt so streamlined and nicely executed. Compiles information from the General All Types Gender and Temperaments Tabs and presents them in paragraph format.   ampnbspampnbspIntroductionReferences in the works as of Gives a general overview of the concept of MBTISocionics and will also give readers a general idea of the extent of knowledgecompetence we the composers have as well as explaining various things throughout the rest of the document.   ampnbspampnbspGeneral All TypesSummarizes survey data on the basis of individual type mostly consists of semiorganized and compiled yet unrefined data. Is used as a reference for other sheets particularly the InDepth Analysis and Overview Tabs.   ampnbspampnbspGenderSummarizes survey data on the basis of each gender for the types consists of semiorganized and compiled yet unrefined data.ampnbspampnbspNOTE The issue of gendertyperelationship duration configurations was separated from General All Types due to the calculation intensive output that would have occurred if each ratertypegenderduration and rateetypegenderduration calculation was performed this resulted in a table that was well over  rows long and made the document excessively slow in a previous version not to mention extremely cumbersome to navigate. Thus the creation of the Gender Tab came into existence! We apologize if an intensive gender analysis is a highly sought after data point   ampnbspampnbspNOTE  There is a gender assessment being worked on and has been included in the General All Types and Overview tabs! Not yet implemented in the individual type analysis tab.   ampnbspampnbspTemperaments in the works as of Summarizes survey data on the basis of the various temperament groupings presented in the IntroductionReferences Tab.   ampnbspampnbspIndividual Type AnalysisSummarizes survey data on the basis of the individual type selected.
