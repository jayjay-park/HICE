My advice is to listen to your cravings and dont worry about consuming too many calories but do try to stick to healthier foods.  Best case scenario it will go straight to your boobs and hips while you keep losing weight on the scale due to muscle loss.

But seriously I think the issue simply stems from people understand homosexuality a lot better than transgenderism.

She has had trans feelings jealousy of guys wishes to experience temporarily be a guy off and on throughout her life but she is also fairly feminine dates mostly men and likes being a girl fairly well so she is not interested in transition at all.  Overall I think your plan is a good one.  Im MtF and spiro reduced my body hair by a lot.  I went from having some dark hair on my chest and stomach to simply having none.  My leg and arm hair is barely there. As for feeling womanly I experiment from time to time with changing my spiro dose and a higher dose definitely makes me feel more womanly which I really like but if the dose is too high then I lose my sex drive completely which is kind of lame so I seek a balance.,MtF,ck83u92,1,t5_2ub9j

2392581,0,t3_2ms2t1,It didnt start off well thats for sure.  I got there right on time or so I thought.  I was  minutes early.  So I waited. I get called I get my vitals checked and I answer questions about Ebola.  Then I waited for  minutes in the room for my doctor to show.  He finally shows up and then begins by apologizing for the delay.  I would come to find out why hes backed up soon.  He asked me about preferred name pronouns etc.  It was a little hard for me to make the choice on pronouns.  So he settled on calling me by my new name Isabelle.  That was...nice.  Then he asked what my story was how I came to feel how I do all kinds of questions about depression and history.  He did seem to be listening and taking notes.  Lots of notes.  The text block on the screen was massive or I was talking a lot and he was recording everything. Soon he asked about my plans.  I told him I was interested in HRT and felt like I had to see if this would help me feel more like who I am not just an empty shell along for the ride.  I said I anticipated that by  months Id feel like I knew if it was for me or not.  The doctor stated that itd probably take more than  months for even the brain chemicals to really start to change and for me to even notice the changes.  I dont like being told I have to make a choice to do this OR that and not have options to go back and forth.  However I felt strangely at peace when I thought to myself its like poker.  Im all in or not.  And I am all in.So he wants a letter from my therapist and for me to sign a informed consent blood draws for baseline..and then..we decide which options to go with.Im scared but happy that Im doing something. would do again.,MtF,cm7fi41,7,t5_2ub9j

3042302,0,t3_2v07j7,Hi Emma Welcome to the sub.. no need to be afraid ive found everyone here to be welcoming and lovely Initially i felt exactly how you felt that i had to do everything at once. I would get worked up  frustrated and annoyed. I felt i would never be able to get the hang of it all. I would worry that i looked stupid masculine or had made a fool of myself.One of the most important things i have learned through my transition is Patience and not to try and do everything at once. Its all about the little goals. For me this helped alot.I did what you did more femme clothing nail polish and some light foundation that was the wrong shade too heavy and badly applied. My eyebrows were not trimmed my hair was short and dont even get me started on some of the times where i tried something new and it went a little wrong.One of the problems most of us transwomen face is that we are going to make the same mistakes as cis girls do. Its just that we make them later on in life... but for me i feel they are a right of passage. I wouldnt be the woman i am today without those mistakes. They made me stronger i should point out i am by no means THERE with everything yetLike i say  all of this takes time. As for Which brands are the best in the early days i think its worth going cheap as thats when your experimenting. I used to just buy supermarket brands and mess about with them. Clothing wise again everyone has their fashion disasters I hate to think about some of the outfits i wore.. but at the time they were right for me as it was a cheap way to figure out what workeddidnt work and what i likeddidnt like.  a little secret i still do to this day is mannequin shop. Look at the store dummy.. like the look.. Give it a try My Cis friends still to this day dont really understand what dysphoria feels like. They just know that i am a woman and thats good enough for them.   In the early days they were there during the times where i would be experimenting.. And because they were my friends they would be supportive of me no matter what.. because at the end of the day thats what friends do.Take it in chunks set yourself small goals. As for the eyebrows Go get the them done. You dont have to go femme yet go in boymode. Loads of guys get their brows done. Same with your hair.

3053402,0,t1_coefwda,As was discussed in another thread the chances of emancipation for the OP are very slim at best.  She would have to be able to be selfsupportive which isnt feasible for her and the state requires that parentsguardians submit the request to the court for the minor which her parents probably wouldnt do.  Im not saying its impossible but the reality for her is that its really not a feasible option at this point.It stinks for her at this point which is a shame as I hate to see anybody have to be this unhappy.  Unfortunately her options are severely limited by her age and the state she resides in.  ,MtF,coehego,2,t5_2ub9j

I find it surprising how long a person can try to make excuses and deny obvious things just so they dont have to feel different from everyone else. Anyways I managed to stop lying to myself but now I feel like I am on an emotional rollercoaster.I managed to get a glimpse of clarity about myself and that feels good but I also feel like I have been hit by a bus going full speed down a highway. Yesterday I realized that I had went over three days without eating because I have been so overwhelmed by the reality of this realization before anyone asks I am eating properly again nothing good can come out of starving myself. I am worried about how I will move forward with my life from here but it is honestly better to have a direct problem to face rather than feeling uncomfortable with myself and not knowing why.I am sorry that this is such a downer and rantish but I needed some medium to help get these feeling off of my chest.,MtF,cow3k31,5,t5_2ub9j

3665862,0,t3_31tw6p,I can really only speak for me. But personally I think that theres nothing wrong with finding trans women especially attractive. Someone thinks Im especially hot? Great! Refreshing change from most of the mainstream world that seems to want to gawk and say how horrible trans women are and how many women who say that theyd never date a trans woman. Granted I approach this from the angle of being attracted primarily to women and as other people have said it tends to be less of an issue there. Although theres the other issue that women who are interested in dating trans women are even more rare.The only problem is going to be if they fetishize it. If I feel like the language and interaction of a sexual encounter is entirely focused on the part of me that I wish I didnt have in the first place thats going to make me uncomfortable. If someone asks me on the first date what size that part is thats going to make me uncomfortable. Overall if Im going to consider a relationship with someone I want to feel like theyre interested in me as a person and not a way of finding the sexual traits they like in the same place. This is...well pretty true of most people I think. Its just something that the chaser aspect has put a lot of trans women in close proximity to. Just treat it like any other dating relationship and it should be fine. When it is time for sexytimes communication is going to be key in the bedroom. I think it always is but its just something to keep in mind especially here. As far as pre or non operative trans women go some trans women are going to want to avoid even vocal references to their penis. Some are perfectly comfortable with their penis. Some will be okay using it for sex and some will be okay with sex in general but will want to avoid using it wherever possible. Its going to take good communication skills to make sure its fun for everyone involved.,MtF,cqa4st7,1,t5_2ub9j

This meant I ate less than others did sometimes or I had salads when others had burgers but it wasnt too bad.Nowadays I am dieting again yea cute dresses sometimes are only in  or  and I wanna get rid of this mangut but having that normalization period in the middle helped a lot in terms of intuitive eating.

3905406,0,t3_34pxx1,Im currently just finishing my first semester here at college and I started hormones near the beginning of it. My biggest tip find a college with gender inclusive housing! I didnt really apply to many places because near the time to apply I was depressed and missed out.Because of that I that I had to room with  guys this semester and trying to get them to understand all my girly things and smells. I was planning on transferring to a college with gender inclusive housing for next semester so I wouldnt have the problem. Luckily though right when I was looking at that my college emailed is saying about gender inclusive housing would be here for next semester.So I applied for that Im now rooming with a girl next semester who also opted into it.So yeah find a college with gender inclusive housing!

We werw talking about how gross we both thought beards were so I mentioned that I used to have a goatee back in high school. She seemed surprised and said she could never imagine me growing out my facial hair so I explained that I did it because I was tired of cutting my chin to pieces. She brought up laser hair removal said how some girls she knows swear by it and mentioned my drastic reduction in beard shadow since she started working there. I admitted to having had two sessions so far which was met with complete lack of surprise.I really need to learn how to steer conversation away from dangerous topics xDShes aiming for the position opening up fairly soon on my shift and if she gets it well be working together every day from now on.

4816325,0,t1_cu0h8pc,gtExactly why I want her to wait before she tells him. I want her armed with knowledge before he bombards her with crazy questions she cant answer.Thats a really great smart way to go about it.  Her having the knowledge about the condition of transgenderism will also make her feel more secure and able to answer his questions and concerns. Its always better to have the facts to back yourself up with.gtI told her that gender doesnt represent your sexual orientation to which she responded with a yeah I know but I wanted to be sure. Not that I blame her Ive only been in one serious relationship Im my entire life and weve never talked about my sexuality before. Im guessing it wasnt ready necessary.I think maybe she wanted to feel out if there was more than one big surprise you know? My mom also wanted to know if I was feeling more attracted to girls although in the long run she has admitted that since I present like a cis gay man in appearances that it would have probably been easier on me if was leaning more towards finding women instead of other men attractive. Its a double whammy when youre queer and trans! P I think your mom will probably find that little tidbit out in the long run when you bring home an eventual girlfriend and the world sees you two as two lovely ladies instead of a heterosexual couple.gtThank you! I do have insurance and it seems they cover everything. They even cover srs but thats not something Im even near considering right now. My main money issue is sperm banking and laser for my face. Groupon has great deals but I just cant afford it right now.Thats really great! D Im so happy to hear that insurances are coming around for major things like SRS and hormones. What have you been doing in the meantime with your face just shaving? I can recommend this really nice shaving creamskin lotion combo that makes your skin feel like butter!

4930198,0,t3_3ifb45,I am about as tall as you but a little differently shaped .  Ive learned a few things but Ive still got a good ways to go.So hair.  I have curly hair.  Check out rcurlyhair .  Some of the recommendations seem more complicated than they really are for example the Curly Girl method is essentially using good lowsulfate shampoo squeezing some of the water out of your hair before applying the conditioner applying the conditioner in a way that doesnt tangle your hair and drying your hair gently.  I do it it works great for days I really dont want to deal with straightening in other words nearly every day and requires almost no change from my daily routine.Honestly I dont know much about makeup.  I know Youtube is a wonderful source but I havent watched any because I feel weird about my boyfriend seeing that Im watching makeup videos.  It sounds ridiculous when I type that out maybe Ill watch a few tonight.If your shoulders arent making you look particularly masculine I wouldnt worry too much.  I can tell you that generally youll want to manage the visual emphasis your outfit gives to your figure.  Embroidery and straight especially horizontal lines in that region bring attention flat areas of color and jagged lines can remove it.  Thin straps and angled sleeves make your shoulders seem wide whereas wide straps and rounded sleeves make them seem narrow.  Check out rfemalefashionadvices sidebar for some great guides.Im still figuring out the whole chest situation myself.  Ive heard that some padded bras and pushups are actually pretty good at turning nothing into something without looking weird.  Lots of us use formers but I dont like them.Waist cinchers arent needed if youve got the booty D or really if you dont feel you need them.  Though seriously theres lots of clothing that will hide a nonfeminine waist.  Just watch out for garments with itchy waist seams youll need a tank or cami to mitigate those.  Of course if you do feel the need to use a waist cincher Im not going to stop you.  I just think clothing decisions can easily make up for not being curvy.When it comes to panties I hear that the best styles to get are Boyshort and Hipster because they provide maximum bulgehiding while being reasonably comfortable.  If you arent overly endowed you can probably hide the bulge by wearing a pair thats slightly too small.  Also some people can do tucking which is a way to temporarily push the testes back into the cavities they descended from.  Ive never been able to tuck results may vary.To get more feminine legs you could try to build leg muscle if you have the fat to cover it.  Otherwise I would just try to work on other things first.Generally flowy long skirts will make your feet look smaller but that really limits your options as does wearing nonattentiongrabbing shoes.  FWIW when youre nearly  feet tall having large feet is to be expected even among cis women.  IIRC Payless has a good selection of larger shoes.,MtF,cufzofz,1,t5_2ub9j

After we got outside on the final day of the event she told me she wanted to go to dinner and that she was really attracted to me. I didnt realize my mental guards were up so I had told her that unfortunately my feelings werent the same but that I would be happy to go to dinner with her.The drive home was a mix of so many emotions as my guards started to get hit with the thoughts of the mistake of just saying no. It ripped me apart until the next day when I decided to text her and say I would really like to go to dinner for the upcoming weekend. I also admitted that my mind was a mess and I was feeling all sorts of new feelings. We texted quite a bit for those days up until the dinner. For the dinner we went out to one of the places in the city. I didnt know what to expect but I made sure to let myself be open and free to what may happen. We had a ton of things to talk about during dinner and it was a delicious time. Before we left we hit the washroom. Just before heading back up the stairs basement washrooms we hugged and she kissed me on my neck. I went ahead and looked her in the eyes and kissed her. The smile after was of that just happened with a mix of did anyone see us since the door was almost opened.We were quite a bit giddy as we walked back. I was still nervous cause I didnt want to endanger her if someone realized we were lesbians. We decided to go back to her place and well.... I had one of the most amazing and incredible times! I learned so much more about myself and Im hoping I made her have one of the best times as well. The time made me realize how much I can love someone else and that my fears of how I would react to certain genitalia was not valid.

Also because of the  hours of sleep I overslept and missed half of my  am class.Things turned around after lunch though! It took a couple hours to talk myself into it but I called and made a counseling appointment! Its in  weeks which kinda sucks but its official now at least! I also had a conversation with one of my professors and its looking very realistic that Ill be able to change my major to what I want it to be.

5611316,0,t3_3ry8k0,Oh honey I so so so so so feel you. About a month ago I wrote a letter to my inner circle friends saying so many of the very things you are saying here. Reading your post it actually felt like you were quoting me. Like this this is some of what I wroteIm holding this dual awareness right now both sides of it are intense and real and bracing. On one hand this is a fucking brutal path Im having I cannot use the word choosing to walk. There is no way around the truth of that around the work and isolation and pain and invisibility and invalidation that comes attached to my identity itself. On the other this is so extraordinary its miraculous that I get to be me I am so profoundly fortunate to be able to have the opportunity to transform myself in order to be who I am. No matter the costs and they are high I am so deeply grateful to have gotten to where I am right now in this.Both sides of that equation are true both are important I am trying to honor them both.But here is the thing that is so hard for me say out loud Im terrified. I hate that I dont want it to be true. But it is. Im honestly deeply terrified. Im terrified of the impact of the choices I am making and I will use the word choice there differentiating between the path I necessarily walk and the choices I make about how I walk that path. I am terrified that I will never ever feel a sense of human connection in which this part of me can be truly held. And I cannot stand to face the reality that no matter how beautifully supportive people are all that love and support might never take away the terror the isolation the loneliness....the deep internal struggle that keeps me wondering if feeling like I am just a freak.Here is the brutal paradox at the heart of my existence I wouldnt choose to be anyone but who I am...and yet...I so wish that I could be anyone other than who I am. And thats just a brief excerpt! What I want to say is that in the weeks since I wrote that I have moved through to a place that feels very different. Its not that any of these painful aspects of our experience are any less real. I think that there are certain parts of this that will always remain extremely difficult. there are losses there is pain and fear and loneliness that no one other than us will truly understand. In other words you are right to protest this. No one should have to go through this. Seriously. It deeply sucks.But I also believe I have to believe that we will come to hold those aspects of our experience in ways which feel different than the way they feel in our darkest moments. We can come to hold ourselves in a new light. I wish that for you so much. I am holding you in my heart with love right now. Truly.,MtF,cwsmyys,3,t5_2ub9j

Most of the power in the golf swing does not come from muscles but from technique and presenting powerful angles at impact so muscle mass decrease shouldnt effect that.

Have been using Minoxidilrogaine for  months on spiro  months Finasteride for almost  months E for almost  months.  months ago the doctor that I went to see for a hair transplant consultation said to give it a year on Finasteride and HRT before deciding.It hasnt been a year yet but Im definitely going to need transplants at this rate  basically nothing has changed either in the M or in the thin spot at the back. Hair is longer and I can style it to make it non obvious but Id never be comfortable with a ponytail with this hairline. YMMV and hopefully yours is better. ,MtF,cy4k3sc,1,t5_2ub9j

6088789,0,t3_3yxksu,I went ahead and editedproof read this for you. Tried to keep it as similar as possible while just increasing readability.gt Dear Mom and Dad gt As another year ends and a new one begins the time has come that I need to be honest and let down a wall Ive had up most of my life. This is the hardest letter Ive ever written but I chose a letter because its the only way to really get out what I need to say. I know this is going to be hard for you to understand it took me years to really understand myself but Im at a point in my life where I cant live a lie anymore especially to you guys the closest people in my life. I love you both more than anything and you deserve the truth. This is beyond extremely hard for me to say and its taken me years to work up the courage so Ill just say it Im transgender. gt I know your probably like What the fuck?!?!? but what this means is that I have the brain of a female. In all likelihood it is biological caused during fetal formation by little more than a slightly off series of hormonal developments. My mind is a girls but its in the body of a boy and it has been this way for my entire existence regardless of how Ive been raised or how my worldly experiences have influenced me. After years of trying to bury these feelings Ive finally begun to accept myself and start the journey to change my body to match my mind. I know youre probably really confused and have a million questions and Ill do my best to answer them. This must sound crazy to you but its how Ive felt as long as i can remember. I want you to know that Im still the person you know and raised and love Im just at the point where Im ready for the outside to reflect the inside.gt You need to know that this is not your fault nothing you did or didnt do led to this. I was born this way and after years of fighting it and hiding my feelings Ive finally accepted myself and I really hope youre able to as well one day. Ive been seeing a therapist who specializes in gender issues and she has really helped me come to terms with my feelings and move forward with becoming my true self. This is going to be a long hard path for me but no matter how scary it is living this lie forever is much more terrifying. Ive spent most of my life burying these feeling as deep as possible doing whatever it took to fit in I became a bully so I wouldnt be bullied. Years of acting out and anger issues and drug use trying to escape from myself. Im done trying to run from who I am. Over the last couple of years Ive really come to terms with this and Im already a much happier person knowing what I need to do. This transition is one the hardest and scariest things Ill ever do in my life and I pray that you can one day find it in your hearts to accept me. I love you guys so much and dont know what I would do without you both but I also know this is huge news for you and it may take some time for you to get used to it. gt That said heres what this means for me... It means that over the next few months I will slowly phase out living as or identifying as a male. It means adding more feminine clothing to my wardrobe growing my hair out wearing make up. I will be using female pronouns. It means spending way too much money to have my beard lasered off my face. It means that I will be undergoing hormone replacement therapy to cancel out my bodys male hormones with female ones. It means that I will be physically developing as a female. It means that I will be a female. It means that over time I will stop dressing like a man at all and will begin to dress and be female full time. It means that I will no longer be speaking with that bassy voice of mine. It means that I will be undergoing a long and tedious process to shift every bit of identification related to me to reflect my female identity which will of course include a change of name. I do love the name you gave me so when I do change my name Im going to change it to Danielle or Dani for short. gt But above all of the rest this is the part I want you guys to understand the most. This is the part where Im going to be emphatic where Im going to be angry and where Im probably going to cry a little. This is the part where I want to make clear that this is not a choice. I am not deciding to become a girl. This is me allowing myself to be who I am and it is the only route that I can take. Im done lying about who I am. Even though Im transitioning from male to female I am going to become a secondclass citizen in the eyes of many people. I am going to be opening myself up to discrimination and hate. I am going to jeopardize my likelihood of finding a life partner who accepts me. I am going to jeopardize my job security. I am opening myself up to abandonment and rejection by family and friends. I am diving headfirst into what is really a whole world of social trouble and it is not something that I would choose to do. Im going to go into debt hundreds of times due to medical bills and this is not something that I would choose to do. This is the next step of my life of my existence and of my development as a human being and this was always going to happen because it was never my choice. gt I know this is a lot to take in but just know that I love you both with all my heart and Ill always be the person you raised no matter what gender I am. Please take as much time as you need to process this. As scary as this is going to be to talk about face to face Ill be ready whenever you guys are ready to talk. All I ask is please dont tell any of my grandparents. Im not ready for that. Shit it took all I had to go through with giving you this letter. I can answer any questions your might have and theres tons of info and resources online I can link you to some great sites if you would like. Thank you for listening and Im truly sorry if Ive hurt either of you. gt I love you both so much D,MtF,cyhpv5p,4,t5_2ub9j

6287981,0,t3_41n1ah,I think it absolutely comes down to who they are to you. I noticed that when I came out to people family included I only ever teared up once. And that was with a friend who Ive known for  years and feel like his family is a second family...even though I see him once a year nowadays. I knew he would be fine since he lives in SF but still. The chance of losing a friend that close to me was so anxiety inducing. He took maybe a minute to respond via text and that was the longest minute of my life. I didnt care nearly as much what my bio family thought but if he had taken it badly that would have ruined a good chunk of that month I think.    Everyone else before and after I was anxious about but I didnt get that amazing release of tensionconcern that I did with him.

Im sorry you were that scared hugs but I really understand your fears about safety I have them too recently. Especially when its dark. So the chocolate helped a bit? At least something. It depends on you. Maybe decide spontaneous when you know how the general attitude towards you is? It might end the way their visit at your work place ended. On the other hand that talk is due maybe even overdue. But from what you said about them they probably only make you feel bad and guilty and going back in denial. hugs No you dont have to thank me.

I just wanna say how great its been to have actual friends that have been nothing but  percent supportive its helped my social transition be a bit easier and not nearly as nerve wreaking as I thought it would.

6344038,0,t3_42hpu8,Hey hun Im sorry that you went through all that and I hope that you will get better soon.I actually got put in a psych ward right after I came out to my dad transitioning. I had a lot of emotions about that particular incident built up and I was in a really bad place. I reacted a bit differently though. I dressed in girl mode the whole time and was pretty adamant about being treated as a female  to the point where they had to put me in a single room because I refused to be go in with another guy. Thats not to say my reaction was better than yours I probably could have saved myself many headaches had I just presented male but it was what I needed.When I was there a lot of what really helped me was talking to the other girls there. There were a few who were my age and even though they werent trans they had similar mental health issues that I could relate to. We played basketball drew pictures and did some other activities like that. I also was able to talk to some of the social workers who were also women about some of my issues being trans and they were very supportive.Hygiene was really big for me. A lot of my dysphoria wasis caused by my facial and body hair so I asked for a razor to shave. They were a little hesitant for obvious reasons but I did eventually get it as long as a nurse stood behind to watch. I got to shave my face but not my legs yuck! but it helped a lot. Also got my mom to bring some makeup.Anyway this is kind of ramble but I hope that you get better and get out of there soon.

Its a spectrum yadayada another thing i hate why did they just dump it all into this one big spectrum with enough variation to basically make it the irritable bowel syndrome of mental disorders but its one of the more notable things that make me just feel like its a diagnosis of you do things differently than other people therefore theres something wrong with you and were going to ignore that there are benefits to it.,MtF,czqf6ft,5,t5_2ub9j

The point of labeling something as neurodiverse is in part to sound not negative but also to distinguish between how society treats people based on their mental health and the perceived norm.It is like the difference between trans and cis. Neurotypical and neurodiverse. Saying the neurodiverse and trans are the same in any manner of speaking is as silly as saying that transwoman is trans.

6715082,0,t1_d0dvzdo,I dunno....I really like the look of red lipstick though.  Plus its only  anyway around . euros. Plus my mom has tons of darker more lip colored lipstick. The clothes are a bit on the adrogynous but I do want some more casual clothes to wear around by myself...and I figured I may need a short sleeve to do that in the spring when its not quite time to break out the dress yet. I made sure to make the shirt as feminine as I could made it fitted so it would be tighter and made it a vneck...but I guess it isnt the most feminine look. I would love to wear it outside of the house...but I do not have that amount of confidence yet at all. I only just got around to finally wearing mens jeans...so thats nowhere near clearly womens black skinny jeans. I do have a fantasy of being able to go to a meeting at a gender therapists office in april wearing that kind of outfit without the lipstick of course and probably with some keds sneakers...if I ever get around to buying those but I know its a pipe dream that Ill never be able to achieve at least in that short of a time span.I guess...but it felt like I was just making excuses to not work at times too.

Im scared because I dont know how shell react. I know she loves me but I also know this is big. I just want her to be happy. When we get married we always say well do anything for our spouses. What if she asks me not to transition? Does anything encompass denying ones own identity? Could I even do that? A marriage is only as happy as its least happy member. If I was miserable she would be miserable. Its a question I have in the back of my mind and hopefully I wont have to answer it.But Im also excited. Since coming out to myself about a month ago its like I opened Pandoras box. Ive got this secret that I cant wait to share with people. So far I bought this really cute color of nail polish that I wear to my therapist appointments and last time I even put on eye liner it looked awful but I loved it.

7119871,0,t1_d1nf8op,Nice to read you are settling into your new job. One positive of having worked your ass off is that youll get paid from two different places for that week. In reply to your PSA... true story When I was but a few months into HRT and visiting Primark to start and build up a wardrobe I took a few clothes to the male changing area to try on. The female attendant told me the changing area for women was on the other floor. Great I thought I must be passing. Inside I was smiling. I thanked her for my mistake and went over to the female changing area. However as I handed over the clothes to the attendant and was about to tell her the number of items she told me that I was at the female changing room and that the male one was on the other floor. Devastated I took the clothes and lowered my face from the women in the queue behind me and left. After that incident it took nearly two years of HRT before I braved another changing room again. So if you ever work the customer services tills and wonder why you have to process so many returns this is one reason. I was forever buying stuff except the knickers to try at home before returning.,MtF,d1nfz83,2,t5_2ub9j

7233911,0,t1_d201xzc,Im going to piggyback off of that and second it. Spironolactone is normally used specifically to lower blood pressure. Usually its effects are pretty minor but if you dont have high blood pressure it can cause your blood pressure to tank. I actually have this problem a lot myself. Just be careful and report anything unusual to your doctor. Thats whats most important.Aspirin mg is not really anything to worry much about anyhow. Its not going to have any real side effects and its all just precautionary. And none of these problems are going to outweigh your desire to transition at least so long as your dysphoria is even remotely as horrible as mine had always been.Of course Im not a doctor but Id be happy to offer the best medical advice I can at any point to you. But under no circumstances should you take my word over that of an official doctor. Maybe when I get my degree in  years thatll change though!,MtF,d20fyf6,1,t5_2ub9j

7347615,0,t1_d2dd43w,Its okay. I was planning out how best to kill myself before I finally said enough and set out on the path of healing. I was on the path to selfdestruction weighing almost  pounds with a veritable cavalcade of health problems. But I soon realized I had to fix things. Ive lost over  pounds and secured the right to transition. I regularly pass and Im in the process of securing a name change as well as an orchiectomy.In short you cant give up. Its so easy to think youve got no future when you suffer each and every day struggling to wake up in the morning and live with a constant facade in front of you... That alone is bad. But then we also have ignorant people decrying as freaks or perverts trying to prevent us from doing even the most minor of things to help keep us both happy and safe. Its ridiculous.But despite all that we cannot surrender. Because we can make things better and though Im still often depressed and it pains me to no end to see the problems going on in the world right now I now realize the only chance for a bright tomorrow is to hang in there and help elevate and empower others.I personally still struggle with selfesteem and see myself as weak and powerless but what i will acknowledge as a strength is my capacity to help others out to reach their own true selves and their own full potential...

Maybe not super sad but I just felt really blah all the time. Your sociopathic tendencies are probably not related to anything sociopathic. More its because you dont feel any joy in your life that you come across as cold or whatever. Again that fit me to a tee before HRT and starting to present as myself. You sound a lot like me. Except youre in a successful career and marriage Im alone and jobless. I even get the part about anxiety and despair being where it ends. If you need to chat or whatever just hit me up.

7376983,0,t3_4g8ytv,For one thing do you know what your levels are? A common mistake I hear is that people consider themselves as starting HRT the moment they took their first pillpatchinjection. Which is technically correct but where changes are concerned time since getting your dosages right is what matters more. If it took you a while to get your levels in the right place you could be actually far less than  months in which can explain mellow effects.But also the YMMV nature of HRT means some people wont have many changes until much later in.With regards to laser it can take a while to considerably reduce the facial hair. While  sessions is the most common number I see cited Ive heard of some people needing twice that in which case youd be only  the way in which would explain all that beard shadow. Also note that laser hair removal has power levels. Talk to your technicians about how youre dissatisfied with the results. Perhaps the power level is too low? Or consider looking for a different place to get laser from?At any rate Im sure youre aware that even if laser fails theres electrolysis. While facial hair is an annoying time consuming and expensive thing to get rid of it can always be gotten rid of with enough work.Also a reminder about the existence of FFS. Its not exactly very accessible but it can do a lot if the effects of HRT fall short. Dont make any plans there just yet though. The magic number I see the most is to wait at least a year for HRT to work its changes. Preferably a little longer due to how much variance there is and to account for time to get the dosages right.I think that if you were to say fuck it and go back to being a guy well presenting as one anyway youd have just as bad of a time. The dysphoria wont go away from doing that.,MtF,d2gpmlv,2,t5_2ub9j

It becomes so very easy to abandon transition for sake of self in combination with the cant pass attitude especially in todays environment where we have people publicly announcing that they will cause harm to those that are visibly trans. Would the people who do not want to put themselves in those situations be not really trans because they happen to be slim average height orc shoulders barrel chest and a terribly masculine face?

8146022,0,t1_d4vs92c,Spiro alone probably wont make you feel like you know what you want. Its E which is responisble for that. And Spiro blocks t so your body stops producing sperm and the danger of infertility is the same as with E. Negotiate again also for your health no sex hormone is bad for the bones. they need either T or E to stay strong.  month probably wont be bad in the long run but still. So adding a sex hormone certainly decreases the risk of osteoporosis. I hope I dont scare you. Even the full  months arent probably a danger but still. Plus if you dont want to bank sperm that should be fine. I didnt do it either. Also because its incredible expensive and also the thought of being a father even when its just biological causes a lot dysphoria. There is still adoption. So yeah negotiate again E is what helps you to feel right. Or maybe not but there is only one way to find out. And there wont be any irreversible changes before you feel it.

Now that you do present as a woman I hope you dont internalize the commercial worlds presentation of slimness as beauty and vice versa. As Im sure you know youll only feel worse if youre not being nourished!And you dont really need to blame anyone for what happened in fact you might find it feels better if you dont but your government really failed you bigtime by requiring parental permission. For what reason? None that I can see. Next time you see Tony Abbott maybe kick him in the nads Of course feelings arent right or wrong they just are and it doesnt always make sense to reason them away. So I dont know if it helps hearing this from me but Ive seen the pictures youve posted before and Id be delighted to look as feminine as you.

Or at least  not many people feel comfortable doing it to a large audience. Anyway. I thought Connor did a good job making clever and interesting jokes while still being respectful.

8665747,0,t3_4ylwfe,A week has passed since I told my parents. They still arent talking to me. Although Im almost  and financially independent I agreed to see a gender therapist to put my parents at ease appt this coming Monday with an LPC. That wasnt good enough though because it isnt an endocrinologist or psychiatrist. Why anyone would go to an endo for gender therapy I dont know. I suspect they will always be moving the goal posts on me. They told me in our conversation a week ago that they dont believe being transgender is real so I cant possibly be. Therefore Im obviously deluding myself so I need to pay every expert in the country to convince me of the truth. Any expert who sides with me is going to be discredited and ignored by my parents like my therapist already has been. Ive reached the point where I want them to just deal with it and get back to me when they are willing to accept my own decision. Im closer with my family than most people probably are so its not as palatable for me to just cut off contact like many others have done. I gave them the goto books and resources but where do you even begin with someone who flatout refuses to acknowledge your condition even exists? It definitely feels like a lost cause.,MtF,d6ou5k3,7,t5_2ub9j

And I know Im being a hypocritical piece of shit. I just find it hard to believe that any cis woman would be attracted to me instead of seeing what I see which is the man underneath.

I am about double that and only out for about . years and only on HRT for  mths.  for me most things are going well there are some days I have some anxieties that get a bit rough and others can be due to dysphoria.  but overall I feel much better about myself.  And would not change who I am.  I hope this helps you in some way. I dont want to give any stats but everyone has a different time of it.

9444076,0,t3_5a27xo,While I can sort of understand what you are saying I think going on HRT for just breasts and emotional effects isnt something ive ever really heard of if someone doesnt plan on ever presenting female. Like it sounds like youd prefer to be a male but with breasts and non functioning penis and more emotional intuition . Transitioning takes a lot of work and there are ways to reverse baldness and get rid of hair in unwanted places. I recommend really considering those options also if you want to transition and are insecure over it.  Estrogen does a lot of good. It sounds you might be comfortable in your male body to an extent. Do you think you might be genderfluid or non conforming?Also the term Assigned Male at Birth is much more popular because despite how I came out at birth I wouldnt describe any of it as male. You cant be born any gender. Gender identity is how you personally feel.EDIT reread it and I can understand more. I sent my friend who understands these feelings a message. They should comment back sometime tonight.,MtF,d9d3qtt,2,t5_2ub9j

I started wearing feminine tops into the fastfood restaurant before changing into uniform. I started wearing a bra at the beginning of the week.

Im guessing that most likely they agree because of money. Its a job and they qneed the work. Transitioning is unfortunately expensive and unattainable for many. Porn and prostitution are a means to that end.Porn is largely demeaning in general but there is a big difference from being called a slutwhore which I and others quite enjoy during sex only versus being called a slur.

Alas I cant figure out how to get DKs facebook page to show up so all youll find through google is the album we released a couple years ago when we were just a straightup punk band.I sing some backup vocals in both and I recently had a verse in one of our DK songs transferred to me cause our regular singer doesnt like it.,MtF,dbtrpq7,1,t5_2ub9j

10159036,0,t1_dbvieo0,Go to someone who neither is a trans woman nor tells you to toughen up then.I went through a lot of bad stuff that made me a mental wreck because of what my parents did. The only reason I am now in a state that could be called mentally stable is that I went to a person who was capable of helping me and started working through it. Whether this person was a man a woman a trans person or a cis person in the end did not matter my circumstances were different enough that had I looked for them with the specific requirements that their life experiences have to match mine in that regard I never would have found help and I still would have been a wreck rather than a person.Not all therapists can help I admit some of them just arent fit to help with what is basically abuse. But I think it would do you well to just try really. Sometimes just being able to talk about your problems with someone you can trust helps. But you do not trust anyone here so that will not help you if anything it will just aggravate you and do the same to the people who come in to check what the post is about and are sensitive due not not having sorted out their problems yet.,MtF,dbvl0a6,2,t5_2ub9j

10458717,0,t1_dctkyvo,Yea from this picture it looks like youve got monolids I have double lids so Im on the other end of the spectrum so the makeup I do is different from yours. Just google monolid makeup to get an idea of what would work with your eyes since I havent really payed as much attention to monolid makeup looks.From this picture its kinda hard to tell but it looks like you have eyeshadow along the outside edge and underside of your eyes not sure if thats intentional or if thats just from a lack of concealer or just because your bottom eyelashes are super thick. I dont think that in itself is bad but without any really visible makeup on your upper lid it tends to accentuate your eyes in the wrong direction and kinda makes them look more downturned Id focus on eyeliner and eyeshadow above the eye to get a more lively shape. Also your upper lashes arent very visible possibly try curling them?Skin looks great lipstick looks great eyebrows dont look patchey at all which is good but there seems to be some stray hairs around the edges not sure if that just needs to be combed straight or trimmed. Overall quite good i think the main area to focus should be on the eyemakeup.,MtF,dctln86,4,t5_2ub9j

You dont need a night cream but it is a more powerful punch for while asleep.Nivea is a midrange brand.  You can go lower but I dont see the point in spending more.Moisturizers help retain water in our skin preventing it from drying out and keeping it hydrated at a base level higher than normal.  It delays the onset of age wrinkles and lessens the appearance of existing ones.  Our skin isnt good at retaining moisture or selfregulating in a modern environment.

10999912,0,t1_ded8fr1,Japp jag r ocks svensk  But I guess maybe the polite thing to do on reddit is to keep writing in english so that everyone can understand? But yeah I really think that the two things you can do are to talk to your mom to get her to understand that you have been feeling like this for a long time and its not just going to pass and also to give her some time to let it sink in and to process it for herself. My wifes biggest issues are also with her mom not accepting it or rather not accepting it as much as everyone else does. And her mom has always been the parent she was closest to too. Maybe its a momthing that you feel like you as a mom should know and understand your child so well that they cant hide something as big as this from you so it feels as if you have failed as a mother when they do?  I am sure she loves you and wants whats best for you but the closer somebody is to you the more traumatic is your coming out to them as well. This affects them too and the chock of finding out can make them say stupid things and react in strange ways that they will regret later when they have had some time to process it.,MtF,deet2i5,1,t5_2ub9j

11677410,0,t3_66ly94,Gender dysphoria is not a label it is medically recognized. You need to be aware that many posters here are going through really difficult periods in their lives experiencing self doubt family rejection discrimination maybe divorce gender dysphoria anxiety or depression and maybe having trouble finding medical coverage. These are all significant personal issues and we cant just turn on a sunshine and sunlight  switch just to entertain you with light hearted posts. What use is this sub to them if they are forced to selfcensor and post ridiculous things like positivity memes or not post at all?Sadly the real world for MtFs is tough and rough. People in personal difficulty should be able to post freely and honestly about their situations. When the world including hugely powerful politicians is determined to crush you or deny your existence pretending everything is all sunshine and light isnt really going to cut it. When the lives of trans people are great and society and medicine catches up when there is no discrimination or suspicion of us then we can all post about kittens and cookies. Until then we post what is real and relevant to our lives  whatever the sentiment. ,MtF,dgjnfz0,6,t5_2ub9j

11716264,0,t3_673v51,My journey with my testicles has been quite long and varied...When I was really young I tried crushing my testicles so that theyd break and the doctors would have no choice but to remove them.In college my gf would jokingly threaten to remove my testicles if I didnt do something for her.  Id of course comply and do whatever she needed but it really was just because I knew that guys are supposed to have testicles and such.  Not that I really cared about having them either way.  And it still didnt dawn on me that Im trans...Now that I know Im trans and have been on HRT for  months now the shrinkage is great but Ill eventually have to get them removed.  Testicles sure are funny things arent they...,MtF,dgo2g1w,4,t5_2ub9j
11720467,0,t1_dgo1cn6,Its because the mods set the CSS    .flairnone         display none    ie theres flair called none. Mobile ignores CSS typically and itll show up as a result.

That and voice are some of what I think I need to really work on.  Hmm I have not tried that device the HRT is supposed to slow body hair growth eventually so it would be interesting to find out if your body naturally slowed or if it was that device.  I might have to get one myself and try it out YES Im getting that same struggle.

11803401,0,t1_dgxofln,gtNo no maybe. If theyre intersex theyre also not born female theyre born intersex. Sorry it is concrete. Your sex and your gender might not line up but your sex is a matter of biology not of opinion.Intersex conditions are rarely even caught at birth. The only ones that are are those with both gentals. The point of the statement was to say that many people may not even know their bodies chemistary. Its not nomral to go get yourself genetically tested. gtThen why do it?The point of the change is because your BC is needed as a legal document proving your identity The thing that doesnt matter is this statement First that this is a certificate for live birth of a female which didnt happen and that if theres no evidence of this person being male  which genetically they are  The circumstances of your birth isnt anything just anyone needs to know. Only people that need to know should know. The DMV doesnt need to know that your trans just that your a legal resident. gtSo live outside the closet and in so doing eliminate the danger of being outed. The fact is that the reason its dangerous for transgendertransexualthirdsexmtf or whatever you wish to be called to be outed is because of how confused people feel about them. Confusing them further is far more dangerous. If some jerk cant deal with his attraction to a transgendered person finds out very very late that theyve done that well its just more dangerous.The dangers we face are not all because we didnt tell people. In a lot of places being trans is all it would take for someone to treat you like your less then human. It might be safe in Thailand but it certainly not safe in much of the world to be open to literally everyone. Socially to all friends family coworkers etc yeah. Many are. Being completely stealth with no one ever knowing is extremely difficult. Its not the common trans narrative.gtIm sorry but if youre on vacation and you need a drug which the dosage is different for men than for women then it is a very serious issue.Medication arent given by sex they are largely administered by your Body Mass Index BMI. Your weight and height largely determine what your going to be administered. There are very few medications that need to take into account sex specifically. Most of which are based on hormones...which we go to great lengths to change. Its possible that those medication might have a bad reaction to your hormone meds of course. But regardless in what emergency situation would you ever be prescribed those yeah? People that have medically transitioned have been around for decades and its never been an issue.gtConjecture.Sure its an opinion. But the chances of someone being able to hide medications hide dilation be completely cut off from anyone that knows and never speaking to them again is just not realistic. Itd take someone really slow to not be able to pick up on someone being trans in a long term relationship. gtI wish that were true genuinely but Ive been snapped at so many times now that I just dont think so. The fact is that I love everyone. If you want to live as a woman more power to you. I understand the birth certificate thing now... I just personally think its silly. Sorry. I mean if you want to make the world a safer place for transgendered people what you really want is to make it more normal and accepted. Hiding your birth sex wont do that.gtI happen to live in Thailand where MTF folks called Catoeys  from the Indian tradition  are for all intents and purposes ladies. Culturally and sexually. To the point where men who sleep with preop catoeys arent considered even slightly queer. Theyve got it easier obviously over here and that should be your goal over in the land of the free. My ..To be fair you are getting a much more peaceful reaction here then youd get stating different opinions in most other heavily opinionated subs. Hell on most of them youd have been banned really fast. P Its silly that its needed sure id love to live in a world that no one cared about my medical history. But thats not the world we live in unfortunately. Maybe someday we can all live without any fear for being trans but until that day its completely understandable for someone not to give that information out freely. ,MtF,dgxyfzx,4,t5_2ub9j
