9083493,0,t3_54mgvx,I suggest a way to get people out into the wilderness and and away from other towns quickly without having to travel thousands of blocks. In which they are given a slimefun parachute and teleported to a random pair of coordanites at  Y. This would solve the problem of the area around spawn becoming too crowded for people to start building quickly.,JonCraft,d83os4m,2,t5_3ep6p
