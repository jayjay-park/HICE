6930056,0,t1_d11t425,I dont know what WCCF is but Konami and Bandai publish or at least have recently collectible card game baseball sets.  Bandais is called Owners League and Konamis is Baseball Heroes  Im not sure if Konami is still doing sets or not.  Theres also been a collectible card game set for MLB released in Japan in the past few years but I dont remember or could find quickly the details off hand.,NPB,d11ui53,1,t5_2w1q4
7052849,0,t3_4bpj0u,Honestly if you cant get tickets in advance Ive never had problems just rolling up to Koshien on the day of a game and buying tickets.  Giants games are popular so you probably want to get those in advance but for everything else you can just get  tojitsuken sameday tickets.  Actually sometimes you can get better seats with a sameday ticket for some reason.  Most people buy el cheapo tix but if youre willing to drop  yen you can get great seats ten or so rows behind home plate.  Anyway just FYI,NPB,d1fss3s,1,t5_2w1q4

8312639,0,t3_4tdsj2,Giants are definitely Japans Yankees. Spend a lot of money national fan presence lots of championships and hated by most other fans. They are also conveniently playing sub. ball this year too! I would avoid the bleacher seats unless you want to spend time reading up on the chants and songs. Otherwise its a ballgame so go and have fun. You should be able to pick up jerseys and hats for whatever team you want at the stadium. While going to koshien stadium would be neat is that the only reason you are in the Osaka area? If you are traveling in Tokyo the Swallows are playing the same day in Tokyo. Might be more convenient for you. ,NPB,d5gmxhs,5,t5_2w1q4

9537769,0,t1_d9op2xv,Yeah I was reading about the Shinkansen about Tokyo to Sapporo and a few friends did it last year   hours to go and  hours back and there is transition station.  But it would be nice to go to Sapporo but personally it would be for the snow festival and then visit the Ham Fighters stadiumstore. I think the problem is focusing on players merch. of then versus now.  The only player that I really wear from the past is Matsui Hidekis NY Yankees jersey and Jeter jersey but selling them probably a hard sale.  What I look for in terms of reselling are car stickers ticket badges.And lastcool to see a densha fan.  My first trip to Japan was introduced to Densha de Go games courtesy of a Final Fantasy VII demo disc and have purchased many densha games since then.  Although I see a few people who have the commemorative coins bags etc. for certain trains during my trip this past month.,NPB,d9oq8qj,1,t5_2w1q4
