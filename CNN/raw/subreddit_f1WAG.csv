6796621,0,t1_d0knhy7,gt What I would like to know is where the heck are Jensons friends? A friend doesnt let another friend get trapped. I always thought of team Button as a group who looks out for each other...so whats happening? For a group of grown men they are really nave. Surely they can tell that she isnt all there upstairs???? Only once she starts setting Jenson up against them to have him all to herself will they realise what all woman see in her.Jensons best friend Chris is dating one of Brittnys friends who is also a model so I think Team Button are all in this together and completely fine with it. ,f1WAG,d0morzr,1,t5_329pc
