2520301,0,t3_2ois1o,On Hitting The Right EmotionsUnless you are truly an unfeeling psychopath or an emphatically clumsy autist all your rational choices and actions have an emotional undertone. I hate to break it to you but thats just the way it is. Many people may think of themselves as rational or unemotional. It is more likely that they are simply out of touch with their emotions and misguided. This is statistically more common than psychopathy or autism combined.What does this mean? It means that YOU are driven by emotion. It also means that  of our fellow man is driven by emotion. It means that its a safe bet to appeal to emotion.So if we know that most people including her are likely to be driven by emotion then what is the next step? How do we discover which emotions she prefers? How do we hit the right emotions? How does this work anyway?Theres two issues that muddle the waters a little bit. First people prefer different things and have different tastes and want different emotions. Second emotional interpretation can be relative nonabsolute personal and varied.Example I like trashy PostHardcore Punk and I like Pop Punk and I like Commercial Trashy Hip Hop. Why do I like these things? For me personally in my personal interpretation of this art they are all three about rebelliousness and being the underdog. I love the story of the underdog and rebellion. I identify with it. I see myself as an underdog. Why? I dont know. Doesnt matter. Point is there is an emotional undertone to my preference in music. Some other dude may like PostHardcore Punk because his big brother who he looked up to listened to it all the time. He may like Pop Punk because he laid his first girlfriend after a Blink concert. He may like Hip Hop because he wants to rebel against his white parents boring jazz music. Why? Doesnt matter.If you realize that YOU prefer certain emotions certain themes certain genres et cetera you can also conclude that everyone prefers certain emotions certain themes certain genres et cetera.Now lets take a detour into TRP territory. The story is always ALL WOMEN ARE LIKE THAT. ALL WOMEN WANT ALPHA. ALL WOMEN USE BETAS. The story is simple and emotionally addictive. My guess would be that many TRPs myself included love the story of the possessor of secret knowledge the majority does not possess. Thats all nice and well but it does not correlate entirely with reality. Why?Likely youve seen it yourself. Youve seen betas with hot chicks. Youve seen ugly guys with hot chicks. Youve seen fat comedians with hot chicks. Youve seen interracial couples though they might be rare. Youve seen people who dont conform to Alpha stereotypes with hot chicks. And so on and so forth. How is this possible? How can this steadfast rule be broken repeatedly?The answer as always is emotions. Alpha  evokes an emotion. Beta  evokes an emotion. Being muscular and tall  evokes an emotion. Being rich  evokes an emotion. Every aspect of alpha can be broken down into emotions that it evokes. Remember the rule that different people want different emotions. Well this also holds true for preference in partners.Just like one guy will prefer brunettes and dislike blondes or another will despise pretentious hipster chicks and adore Catholic school girls  the same holds true for women. Some will love the orange tanned douchebag with the large muscles and trendy fashion. Others will prefer the boyface One Direction stud with the fresh coup and adorable dimples. Yet another dame will want a scarfaced fatty who entertains her with good jokes. Different people want different emotions. Ill give two more indepth examples. One my roommate Priscilla a blonde bombshell babe. Shes like a little angle. Shes daddys little girl. She wants to live up to the expectations of being the good girl. She dislikes playing games even though shes hot. She dislikes unfuzzy cold or harsh emotions. She likes loveydovey emotions and being called an angle. Not every girl likes this. But Priscilla does.Two think of the spoiled arrogant brat archetype. The crazy chick. She KNOWS shes a shitty human being. She KNOWS shes selfish. She KNOWS shes a bad girl. What emotions does she want? She doesnt want loveydovey. She wants to be treated badly because thats her selfimage. Whether this is good or bad is besides the question  it just is. Just like I prefer an intelligent girl with character she prefers a badboy who gives her highs and lows. Not every one wants the same exact thing!Now lets go back to FBL back to telling stories back to uncovering what her preferred emotions are. Remember the two points. First emotional interpretation can be relative. Second people prefer different emotions. We are making stuff people relate to. Things people relate to are considered art. Heres how art works roughly said. FBL stories are basically art. With art a person engages it they interpret it filter it through their memory see if any memories can be connected to the art or idea or concept and finally they learn a new emotional truth of themselves. The short way of describing this is relating. So we drop a line about family or about a dead pet or about finding money or about enduring hardship  the girl can relate to this. Through relating she gets to experience the emotions.But now we have a problem because we cannot read her mind. If I tell a story about family she might hate her family she might love her family she might find them boring she might find them the most important thing in the world. We cannot predict how a story will be interpreted emotionally for . But we do not need  accuracy. She hates her family  we gave her feelings of pain and remorse and shame and regret. She loves her family  we gave her feelings of safety and warmth and love and protection. Either way we have given emotions and that is the goal of FBL.So now finally we come to the topic of discovering preferred emotions. And this is an ART not a science. This is how it works. You drop some FBL stories and you watch her response. With some stories like a prefabricated resolving pair you can with high accuracy guess what emotions were induced and judge the reaction. With a Sophies Choice the emotions are more complicated but you can still see if something sticks or not. Judge the reactions! Anything that does not elicit a response is emotionally irrelevant basically. Anything that does elicit a response is relevant. Use your intuition your experience your common sense to get a feel for which emotions seem to stick. Then keep giving em. Eventually one may become satisfied with enough helpings of surprise. Notice this by judging reactions. Then start giving a new emotion. If a girl can prefer horror movies over romanticcomedies than it makes equal sense she may prefer feelings of excitement fear and anticipation over hope comedy and love.I hope this rant made a little bit of sense. Ill need to practice more to get better at discovering preferred emotions but Im confident Ill get there eventually.,FeelingsBeforeLogic,cmnji8j,2,t5_355aa
2545255,0,t3_2nvzu5,Wed  Dec  I asked some people for feedback on my stories. Most of my guy buddies thought they were funny but they also seemed to be pretty unbelievable. Im guessing believability is more important than Id thought. They also found the emotional progressions to be too abrupt. As in we get a good lead some good build up but the emotional drop is too sudden and heavy that it feels out of place. Maybe its just a guy thing. Ill have to ask some chicks for feedback as well.,FeelingsBeforeLogic,cmqsv1g,1,t5_355aa
