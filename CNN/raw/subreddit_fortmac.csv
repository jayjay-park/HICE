630468,0,t3_21032f,Do you have any relevant experience? If not get a trade. Safety Officer is an outdated term its Safety Advisor or Safety Coordinator now. Safety people arent cops. The NCSO program is a joke. The ACSA push people through like cattle thousands every year. Its a very low quality education and youll be a dime a dozen afterwards. Oh yeah you have to have experience to get into the program.The programs at NAIT and UofA are good. A CRSP designation is a must as is real experience. Lots of companys want a science degree too.You are better off getting a trade. Seriously.,fortmac,cgbxo00,3,t5_2s46j

2345968,0,t1_cm1ewkn,Yeah Costco IMO is the biggest missing piece.The theater is absolute garbage and a complete shame but at least theres work being done towards fixing that.There isnt enough gym space in general  the gyms we do have are nice but they are too crowded. That should also be fixed in the next couple years hopefully Northside Rec Center and the future World Gym by the new theater.Theres a lack of car dealerships too  I realize the fullsize pickup truck is the big ticket in town so the  dealerships we have carry a truck. But I think there would be a market for other nondomestic brands. Wheres Honda Nissan Mazda VW? Given how expensive any mechanical work is lots of people would rather buy a car with an extended dealer warranty and never have to worry about finding a trustworthy mechanic. The lack of options for new cars is disappointing.Some might not agree but I think our restaurant selection is pretty bad especially in the midhighend. We have the usual chains but very little interesting or outside the norm. No real fine dining option except maybe The Keg which is yet again a chain. Tangentially a lack of a real coffee shop a nice quiet place where you can sit down and enjoy a good coffee.I agree with your other suggestions though  especially the downtown revitalization plan! What a mess.,fortmac,cm1o8m9,1,t5_2s46j

7763909,0,t3_4ln6rs,I talked to my landlord and he was willing to waive rent for June. My coworkers landlord demanded hers be paid for June. I think it comes down to individual landlords. ,fortmac,d3op203,4,t5_2s46j
