11155834,0,t1_dewgzgn,The switch is the loudest thing on the cube.  Its as loud as a real light switch or maybe louder... you can fidget with it very quietly by just pressing it back and forth without letting go but it lacks the satisfaction of a real switchflip.  So I wouldnt get a real one just in hopes of a quieter switch.,fidgetcube,dewi30a,2,t5_3gbwb

And the way your comment is phrased makes it sound like youre in favor of the official one which is like  not including shipping. So you would be ok paying SampH for a cube youre not sure if you would like but  is too much?,fidgetcube,dgo1ho5,2,t5_3gbwb
