3520002,0,t1_cpthde3,gt The whole point of a wastebasket is to avoid unwanted deletions.Thats the whole crux of the matter.If you press the delete key unknowingly moving to trash without notification or undo is effectively losing them. You dont go looking in the trash for files you did not remember deleting. Also there is no affordance for the user to know that a file disappeared and went to the trash.Thats why a more structured key binding key  modifier was used to avoid accidental deletions and thats why now that you get an inapp notification with the ability to undo the action the structured key binding is not necessary any more.gt  whereas on OSX which is often nonstandard as most things by Apple whose motto used to be Think DifferentOh come on. You can do better than that. Changes are done in response to actual testing and design intent. Shuffling code around is not the goal and being different is an antigoal.,gnome,cpti8cd,-1,t5_2qjhn

6773035,0,t1_d0jqv8e,Glad you like it.I think Debian testing being slightly harder to find than stable is acceptable less newcomers sighing why something may not be working as expected however might prevent someone from sticking with Debian. But pretty sure within a week someone who is looking around because outdated packages! stumbles upon testing.I strongly disagree on the pointless settings there is no way they exist to not change anything at all. You can remove the panel because it gives you that much freedom to shape the environment in perhaps very unusual ways allows for mixing with other panels etc. You obviously cannot say GNOME  gives you that control even though it claims in the second sentence of its description.Its great that you and many others who use it like it default configurations are a thing. But it does not allow to even have a task bar without having to rely on someone making an extension for it. If we are to argue about most important things I think its more important to know what else you have running other than the current application that is obviously in the focus. Secondary to you and the developers sure. But dont go claiming you get more control over the desktop as if you got more than with most of the others.,gnome,d0k07zx,0,t5_2qjhn
