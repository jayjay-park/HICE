101482,0,t1_cepzghc,Heres a bit from linked Wikipedia article about Drag equation  gtgtIn fluid dynamics the drag equation is a formula used to calculate the force of drag experienced by an object due to movement through a fully enclosing fluid. The formula is accurate only under certain conditions the objects must have a blunt form factor and the fluid must have a large enough Reynolds number to produce turbulence behind the object. The equation isgtwheregtThe equation is attributed to Lord Rayleigh who originally used L in place of A with L being some linear dimension.gtThe reference area A is typically defined as the area of the orthographic projection of the object on a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion. For nonhollow objects with simple shape such as a sphere this is exactly the same as a cross sectional area. For other objects for instance a rolling tube or the body of a cyclist A may be significantly larger than the area of any cross section along any plane perpendicular to the direction of motion.

200038,0,t1_cf15u1d,OK just went by there. Not a specific bike signal going West on Dunsmuir. What you are supposed to do is cross Dunsmuir and wait in the green box for the light to change and then cross Hornby. But taking the lane and making a left is super sketchy. There are  lanes and Honby is one way going North. So the leftmost lane is effectively a turn only lane although this is not marked. The middle lane can presumably turn left as well or go straight. So if you were riding on the street youd need to be in the middle lane and swing the turn wide to the right to catch the bike path. If you had been on the bike path the only way to get there would be to cut into traffic half a block back and cut across to the middle lane. If you held the lane and clearly signaled and waited your turn without splitting a lane it would be technically legal but still a bonehead move. The only possible advantage is that you dont have to wait for the westbound light to change if you are waiting in the bike box as the infrastructure was designed.As a cyclist I would fully get behind laws to require bikes to ride in bike lanes where there is separated infrastructure. Downtown Vancouver has the best cycling infrastructure in North America and there is no reason not to use it. If if it was  the cars fault which I doubt does that help if the rider got killed? If you stay in the bike lane and cross with the light you literally cant get hit by a car. There are planters with dirt in them that are really effective barriers. Check out this simple image Why the hell would you want to be in that middle lane and exposed to car traffic when you could be in a protected bike lane?,bicycling,cf185vi,5,t5_2qi0s

I have to be honest here even its unpopular and gets downvotes I ride out on the road a lot but there are places that its just not well suited.And that cant always be resolved with some signs.  Sometimes it takes a lot of money which the town may not have.  And sometimes even then its a lot more difficult than it seems.  For instance adding bike lanes could mean needing to widen roads which could mean extending roads into the property of residents.  That kind of thing can get tied up in courts for years.I live in a widespread city.  And there are roads that I DO NOT ride on.  Whether I have the right to or not it would just be really stupid to do so.Im all for getting more bikers out there getting people more aware improving safety etc.  But that is much easier in some instances than others.  And I think this guys response was inappropriate in how it was delivered.But I dont know enough about this town and I assume most of the people in this thread dont either to really start knocking him and the residents.  Maybe its really not ideal place and even though that could potentially change they simply dont have the resources to change it.Im not saying thats the case.  Im saying I dont know and that most of the people here probably dont either so Im just suggesting that people arent too quick to jump onto something they dont know much about.

He let me my friends and  kids sleep on his farm and the next day he gave us a tour around the farm and of course some fresh milk.The machine is amazing and the cows literally enjoy it they wait in line to get milked. Each cow has a chip implanted which allows the machine to keep track of the amounts of milk produced per cow. Also some cows liked the machine so much that they came in too often some got back in line just after they were milked! so the machine had to refuse them. The cows first have to produce more milk otherwise the machine is cleaning and disinfecting itself for minimal amounts of milk.If for some reason a cow should be milked but did not go in the machine by itself for some time the machine would inform the farmer. The farmer then would lure the cow in with some kind of food or treat. Sorry for the long post I got carried away.TLDR The cows enjoy the machine and its really cool to see.,bicycling,cfj3bl1,8,t5_2qi0s

382838,0,t1_cfk3xo1,My wife rides a defy and I ride a TCR.  Were the same height and Ive taken hers out for extended rides.  Both bikes are very nice and both will treat you well over the long distance rides you are planning.  One of the main differences I noticed between our two bikes was the gearing ratios.  The defy is a triple front and  in the back whereas my tcr is double in the front and  in the back.  Oddly even though hers is a triple I still had easier gears due to the big  in back!  We eventually swapped out her rear derailleur for a long cage version and put a  on there since we were doing a lot of riding in the mountains and she was getting killed.  So check the gearing ranges on the two bikes!Another difference is that her wheels came with more spokes sturdier and c tires slightly wider than the s that came on my TCR.  While in general c tires are probably recommended for longer rides the c tires she had were very cheap wire bead and both had to be replaced in less than km.  Mine fared slightly better and lasted about km despite my extra kgs.  My low spoke countradially laced rear wheel has not fared so well though... three broken spokes in km.  All due to the nipples busting off.My TCR is carbon so perhaps the one youre looking at is not like this but it does not have mounts for panniers or fenders.  So one BIG advantage for the defy for your purposes could be that that it comes with proper mounts for front and rear paniers andor fenders.  If you do some commutingtouring the defy with these mounts will do much better.The components on the TCR  are slightly better but you could also step up to the defy  or  if you have the cash.

469174,0,t3_1zget4,Lots of info here.  I did a century the end of  on a group ride.  Having rest stops every  miles will make it so mush easier.  The biggest issue is getting enough water and food on your ride.  With rest stops it makes it easier.  Plus they probably will be full of stuff that is good for you.  If you have  months you should be fine.  When I was training my longest ride I think was in the low s.   But if you are in a group ride you probably will be riding with people so it will be easier.  Just make sure you dont go out to fast or you ride with people that are riding too fast for you.          I believe I finished my century under  hours .? so I wasnt going to fast.  I hooked up with a few other people in the beginning and rode the whole way with them.   I was told under  is a pretty good time to shoot for when riding a century.

482203,0,t1_cfuxkl8,Interesting.I wonder how much our different experiences reflect different perspectives on the exact same thing?  I was a fairly new commuter in a city where traffic of all types is far less civilized than Utrecht at the time I started travelling there.  Maybe I was struck by the comparative orderliness of it all and downplayed everything else.  Or maybe you got used to the culture and paid more attention to the groups that spent less time cycling strictly to the rules?I notice the same thing even here Pittsburgh.  If you talk to different groups about the state of cycling in Pittsburgh youll get very different answers.  I remember when bike commuters were so rare that they were mostly labelled as crazies and I took it up when it was still relatively uncommon.  I look around at the progress weve made and marvel at how far weve come.

531311,0,t3_2075sv,Thats not as bad as you think. Youre probably better off on a  cm but thats a traditional geometry bike with a higher top tube than most newer bikes so you can expect to have less seatpost exposed than on a newer compact geometry. As long as you are extending your knee to around  degrees at the bottom of the pedal stroke you should be fine. Without seeing you on the bike I cant say but it is pretty common for novice cyclists to ride with their seatposts too low. The area of bigger concern when fitting a bike is the reach of the bike since that cant be adjusted. A cm Trek is generally about a half centimetre shorter in reach than most other brands s so Ive had a few guys at  get on them and feel comfortable but most of them have been pretty lanky for their height. If the reach is too long you may experience some hand neck and lower back pain particularly on longer rides. You may want to try it with a mm stem. I cannot tell by the picture how long the stem is but most s come with a mm stem. Because its just a little bit on the big side for you I wouldnt worry about any handling issues but ride it to get started and then if you really get into the sport try out a couple of cms for your next bike.

Those small jumps have made a massive difference when you look at the big picture.Performance cant increase without making old stuff incompatible but that doesnt make it obsolete. You can still buy spare parts for  speed drivetrains in bike shops. You can still order  rims laced to freewheel hubs.The whole point of planned obsolescence is to make people buy the latest and greatest. The bike industry has got tremendous support for older standards allowing you to rebuild most bikes built in the last  years with off the shelf components even if theyre a bit obscure.

Tickets are classified into three categories Minor Major SeriousMost insurance companies give you one freebe minor ticket before your rates are affected amp many will actually give you two.  However  convictions for kmhr over the limit that do not give you a single point?  Well youre rates are going up the same amount compared to if the  tickets were for kmhr over the limit for a total of  points.Its a common misunderstanding in Ontario for drivers to put so much interest in points on their abstract. A friend of mine got a kmhr over the limit speeding ticket.  He took the entire day off to go fight it ended up negotiating it with the JOP to a get it knocked down to kmhr over and felt he made a huge win.  In reality he lost  in wages that day to save him something like  in a lower fine and it was no different in the eyes of his insurance company.The main purpose of points is not to drive insurance rates  its to ultimately take repeat offenders off the road regardless of their ability to pay fine after fine for their bad driving.,bicycling,cg5580m,3,t5_2qi0s

It uses a different type of headset to what you normally find on a bike and you dont need a stem cap.Rather than putting on the stem and then the top cap and applying forces to the top of it to push everything into place and keep it secure. This one works by putting the stem on tightening it and then adjusting the headset underneath to expand and keep everything tight.It works like this  I do normally have a little cap with a hole in it so you can see down the top.

They are different types of hubs and you need to choose the correct one for your setup. A freewheel cassette screws onto a hub with no ratchet in the hub. A freehub takes splined cassettes and part of the hub rotates i.e. has the ratchet. Freewheel cassettes are used on older lower gear count wheels  speed for example. Freehubs are what replaced them.

897434,0,t1_ch69bl6,The best thing to do is ride the bike for a while and put it through its paces.  Most problems will reveal themselves just doing that.  But heres a checklist of sorts for things to look over Drivetrain.  This includes everything between your feet and the rear wheel pedals cranks chainrings chain cassette derailleurs plus the shifters brakes and cables.  Check the chain for wear measure the length of  links should be  plus a bit no more than  more.  Teeth on chainrings and cassette shouldnt show obvious wear although its hard to tell on modern drivetrains  a worn chain can be a better indicator.  A clean drivetrain is a good sign.  Shifting should be quick smooth and precise without grinding the chain against anything crosschaining excepted.  No rust or noise when pedaling. Check the brake pads for wear and alignment with rims.  Run the bike through all its gear combinations. Frame.  Check for dents and cracks.  Dirt and scratches arent usually a problem. Bearings.  Theres four to be concerned about here the wheel hubs bottom bracket between pedals and the frame and headset between steering column and frame.  Everything should turn smoothly but without being loose.  Pull side to side to make sure. Wheels.  Check for true by spinning and looking for sidetoside wobble.  Spokes should be at roughly the same tension making the same pitch when plucked and straight.  Check tire condition cracking weathered or worn. Saddle and Handlebars.

910604,0,t1_ch7irx6,Montreal is better than many North American cities when it comes to biking yes. But it still gives far higher priority to motor vehicles. Unless youve missed the drama earlier this week youll also know there are huge gaps in this infrastructure that can get you killed. The busier cycle paths are badly designed and dangerous for the most part Maisonneuve because they are designed for cars with concessions made for cyclists rather than the other way around. But until we undergo a huge shift of mentalities and a pushback against cars as the Dutch did  years ago bicycle infrastructure will remain an afterthought rather than a focus.And this is not really infrastructure but politicians keep promising to change laws to better protect cyclists and have yet to do anything about it. In the meantime we are stuck with the SPVM being given far too much room to interpret the laws to cyclists detriment and apparently caring more for their ticket quota than the safety of other human beings.,bicycling,ch7si8r,2,t5_2qi0s

960429,0,t1_chdcp3r,Switching to gatorskins is not a bad idea.  Flacvest is correct the gp is grippier tire with softer sidewalls and slightly lighter ie ride quality but the gatorskin has a well earned reputation as a super durable and flat resistant with perfectly acceptable ride quality.  So dont feel bad about taking the bike shop dudes advice  it was sound.To be honest it sounds like you are fairly new to cycling??  Not that important but just offering up some advice and explanation as to why people are unwilling to sell you deep carbon rims.First and foremost cost. The real deal is crazy expensive.  Deep carbon rims are pretty much the pinnacle of expensive cycling shit.  You can easily drop  thousand on a set of custom hubs spokes and carbon rims. Most bike shops do not sell unbranded chinese carbon rims hell there are plenty of bike shops that dont even carry expensive real carbon rims because they do not cater to those types of cyclists and dont want to spend the money on that inventory.MOST IMPORTANT If you want chinese carbon wheels do it.  They have a great aesthetic are probably quite aero and will be light enough to do the job quite well.  Most people report good things and the stigma against chinese carbon is mostly undeserved and the price cant be argued with.Why are people unwilling to sell  not recommending them to you?  Wheelbuilders are often old school.  They like loose ball bearing hubs open pro rims and  spoke counts.  This shit works and is easily trued repaired serviced or rebuilt.  Carbon wheels are generally none of those things and if they do break or delaminate it is most likely to happen on a descent from the heat of your brakes.  THIS IS HOWEVER HIGHLY UNLIKELY.  Also the conventional wisdom with climbing is to stay lightweight with a shallower rim.  This does not make it universally so and Flacvest is correct imo about aero advantages of a moderately deep rim versus the weight that material adds.edit one last thing about deep rims are crosswinds.  People are not joking when they talk about how difficult it can be to control your bike in high winds with deep rims.  Something to consider if you go deeper than  or mm.Combine some of the things I have said... you seem new to this and definitely do not need deep carbon wheels to win a race... they are expensive... a lot of wheelbuilders do not generally build carbon wheels especially unbranded chinese carbon... etc. and so forth and you get the advice you are receiving.  It is good advice but you want deep carbon wheels so hit up ebay or wherever and make it happen.,bicycling,chdgk7g,5,t5_2qi0s

964795,0,t3_254o6w,Im all for Idaho stops and being able to cross a red light after stopping and looking on both sides that the way is clear and do it all the time on my bike but the justification used in this articlevideo is incredibly annoying to me as a physicist.That is the justification being that Unlike a car getting a bike started from a standstill requires a lot of energy from the rider. This statement is true for both cars and bikes and every other vehicle or mass replace rider by engine in the case of a car. It is Newtons first law that says that maintaining a constant speed does not require energy neglecting friction or gravity in an uphill course. If a car were to only slow down rather than make a full stop it would save lots of gas in the same way that it prevents additional exertion from the rider. In my mind this alone is not at all a valid argument for the Idaho stop.  I believe that Idaho stops being allowed only for bikes make sense not because they are more efficient as this argument applies to all vehicles but rather because they are much safer to do for a bike than for a car and thus the efficiency gain vs safety risks equation makes them justifiable only for bikes but not for cars.The first reason is that on a bike you have a much better visibility of the road and no dead angles caused by the frame of the car. You also travel at a slower speed and thus have more time to react in the event a vehicle or pedestrian arrives at an intersection. Furthermore a bike has significantly less inertia than a car which makes the energy efficiency argument lean disproportionately more towards cars than bikes btw. This means that bikes have a shorter stopping distance and in the event of a collision the damage is vastly inferior.Finally since bikes occupy less space on the road especially in terms of width they can much more safely swerve to the side to avoid a pedestriancaretc. suddenly jumping in the intersection at the last minute even if braking distance is too long and that without having to cross into the oncoming lane. Bikes are also much more maneuverable than cars which helps strengthen this argument.rant,bicycling,chdyfrf,10,t5_2qi0s

When we arrived at the hospital with our corpsman the doctor came in to tell us that our friend okay but he had broken his neck in  different places.

On a freewheel type hub the drive side bearings are near the threads for the freewheel so there is a bunch of axle hanging past the bearings.The gears do wear out over time whether on a freehub or freewheel but I dont know the condition of yours and its hard to determine by just looking at it unless its really worn out.As long as the spokes are tensioned sufficiently and you have a decently strong rim it should last fairly long.In the US you could get a custom build wheel with Shimano SLXLXXT hub DT Competition spokes and Velocity Dyad rim for around  and that would be bulletproof if built well.  This would not work with freewheel so youd need a  speed cassette and spacer for around .  I dont know much about freewheel and what prebuilt wheels are even available.

Thus generally you need to match Sun Tour indexed shifters with Sun Tour rear derailers.However it turns out that Sun Tour speed shifters index pretty well with speed clusters if you replace the old Sun Tour rear derailer with a Shimano unit!gtThe mismatch in cable travel cancels out the mismatch between  and  speeds.

If its just hand built using junk parts not meant for your weight and needs no amount of expert assembly is going to stop the problem. Unfortunately most stock wheelsets on complete bikes are machine built with low quality components. My cycling clubs president has gone through two Bontrager rear wheels on his .k Trek FS mountain bike from cracking the rims and hes about your height and reasonable weight for his height. Our local bike guru took one look at the rims and told him they were underbuilt for his size. Hes finally caved to a proper wheelset.So you need enough spokes for your weight and just as importantly a rim designed for strength not saving grams. Since the CrossRip can basically take MTB wheels id go for a beefy MTB setup or at least something with  spokes and a tough rim.,bicycling,cht1eso,2,t5_2qi0s

1138984,0,t1_chxqbah,Dunno about the tubes theyre usually just thicker normals are just fine.The tires are just fantastic heavy which means accelerating is slower but thats made up for by their long lasting tread and bomb proof structure. The saddles handle sweat just fine. You put a sort of treatment on them which smells a bit like vegetable oil and has the consistency of vasaline. This protects the saddle against water and keeps it lookin good. there are also rain covers which are cheap and just work. People really seem to like the selle anatomica its hamocking and yet long enough to move around on to get a range of positionsSaddles are long term investments and comfort is important to long distance riders and they can always be transferred to other bikes and have a high resale value. So spending  usd is worth it for some. I certainly love my brooks. New pads and tape as well as tires are kinda cheap and are good upgrades. For me  on tires wasnt bad considering how long theyve lasted and how well theyve worked. I would reccomend a new triple or compact crankset for hills but they dont have to cost too much. priority is probably for cost drive chain levers are fine but replacement of derraileurs can be costly sora generaly is good and just works Saddle theyre pricey but they generally dont brake my dad has had his brooks b for years tires tubes dont matter so much new pads and tape.

1194973,0,t3_27sxud,Hey I have two belt bikes.The cons  You do lose efficiency compared to a perfectly aligned and clean chain though that article tests a belt under  lbs which is huge!  I run mine at  and I dont really notice a difference.  I dont race and Im not particularly fast though.  Edit  Im trying to find the actual numbers for a CDX belt lbs IIRC its  Internally geared hubs are heavy and expensive so if you want to go geared with a belt theres that to consider.   Difficult to change ratio if youre riding fixed or SS.  This has never bothered me but some people really dislike it. Some people have a hard time with belt tension.  It took me me about  minutes to learn how to properly tension it and its never been an issue when changing a tube but I will throw it out there. You need a frame that can support it.The pros Lasts longer than a chain. Weatherproof.  Bombproof probably. Super quiet and very very smooth  it feels like riding butter! No grease which is nice.  Especially nice if you commute and need to wear dressy clothes that dont play well with grease.   A lot less maintenance.  Its perfect on an all weather commuter.   Just fun overall  the belt has been a great conversation starter and lots of people are interested in it.  I have been commuting about  miles daily on a fixed gear belt drive for a year and not a single belt part has needed to be replaced or serviced.  I also have a single speed that uses the older CDC belt and while I recommend the CDX belt as it can be run at a lower tension and therefore causing less of an efficiency loss both belts are fine.  Truthfully its still a bit pricey and probably isnt worth it for everyone.  I got a belt because I was commuting along the ocean and the salt and sand were tearing my drivetrain apart daily.  With the belt  zero problems.  Zero.  However chains have been around for a long time for a good reason and though belt technology is getting more widespread and improving tell your friend to really weigh the pros and cons before diving into getting a belt.  Not that I dont support more love for belts but aside from the price they can also be theft magnets!Heres my commuter fixed gear and heres my Trek District Carbon.  I maybe have a thing for Districts.  One of these days Ill go internally geared hub and try it out but until then I can only speak for fixed and SS belt riding.  I love it and am currently working on another fixed belt frame!  They ride great Ive done  mile rides on both of these and will probably go belt for all future SS or fixed builds.  ,bicycling,ci41x86,5,t5_2qi0s

1208578,0,t3_27ycwc,As a new cyclist in Southern Ontario I dont like this article. Where Im from Kitchener we are told that streets are dangerous. They are a place for cars not pedestrians or bicycles. If you put me down in the middle of the street I would feel very uncomfortable just because thats how I was raised to feel. Drivers always come first and drivers believe that the road is their god given right to drive on.Now that bike culture is exploding across the nation cities are throwing bike lanes down on busy roads and wondering why no one uses them as is the case in Kitchener. Its because we are all scared to death of cars and the road. Im working on getting over this fear as Im living on Ottawa right now but the bottom line is that cyclists AND drivers are scared when cyclists use the road in my home area. How do you fix that? How can we develop a confident cycling culture? Well you need people to get out there on their bikes. Paths are great for this as they help develop confidence in a cyclists abilities for when they go to ride on the road. Sure road bikers dont want to use the paths and want to bike on the road. Thats great. But the casual cyclist the  does not want to bike on the road. I acknowledge that there are issues with intersections but there are ways around those issues. I read somewhere that a viable option would be for the bike path to join traffic briefly through a large intersection. Im sure there are others like forcing a dismount. Sorry for the rant but if city planners want cyclists in North American cardriven cities you need bike paths. ,bicycling,ci5l07j,1,t5_2qi0s

1231289,0,t3_287eqh, weeks is short time but it can be done. When I first did a century a metric but a century nonetheless I was doing average rides of about  km and a big ones of  km. If you are doing  miles per ride often try doing  miles the first week. And do so for  weeks. Just dont try and do it in the same time. Its not possible. And you need to have shorter recovery rides so you stretch your legs and dont just tire them. And when I said do  miles I meant twice in a week tops! Then step it up again to a  or even . Do it gradually believe me after the first loner ride you will be surprised that you managed to do it and not feel like your life will end at the next second. Believe in your self if you ride regularly then your legs are not the problem. A century is just a longer ride. It takes longer and requires more food and drink. If you have big hills in the first half you dont go full speed you take it easy and conserve energy for the second part. If you have big hills at the end you save your energy in the beginning so you can climb those mountains. Going on a ride which will take most of the day is mentally challenging. You need to go in steady pace and not force yourself too early. If you need a brake take it. Seriously. Half an hour brake midway point will do you wonder.

Im just gonna stop here.  You cant claim one group is responsible for one behaviour while ignoring that a larger much more egregious group commits many times more of those behaviours every day. That is not logical or ethical when it comes to making an argument.  Bringing up but cars do that very same thing thousands of times a day is an entirely relevant point especially since theres a study proving it .  I have no idea why  you take issue with that. Are you saying the number itself millions has no basis in reality?  Because it does.  A single person if they are in the habit of slightly running stop signs the behaviour in question here might run anywhere from ten to fifty stop signs in a single trip remember.  This isnt a they do it one time a day sort of thing its ingrained behaviour.  There are millions of drivers on the road logging billions of hours of driving a day.  And youre going to claim that millions of infractions per day is hyperbole?Alright.gtThere are lots of drivers but just because youve seen a few breaking the law doesnt mean they all do.Ignoring the statistic from the study that says  of drivers dont stop at stop signs?

I can maintain  for quite a while and s when sprinting.  But Im not the strongest man as hills prove to me all the time.Are you really breaking  mph so often that it becomes the dominant factor in gear selection?  I believe picking a chainring or cassette based upon the peak speed one gets when bombing down a hill is poor advice.  I believe one should pick a set of ratios which works for the majority of your miles.  IOW if going to a larger chainring for the  minutes a week ya bomb a hill punishes you the other hours and hours a week when it can force big ring downshifts which would not have otherwise happened.

Both the tires you linked have wire beads. But if one of those was a mistake and the other tire truely isnt wire bead then its likely a Kevlar folding bead which is a newer option. They can be folded unlike wire beads so theyre easier to packagetransport and they are usually lighter. Wire bead tires are usually cheaper. Otherwise I cant see much of a difference with those tires. You might have better luck with Schwalbes website instead.

Great fun Ive been doing sessions like this twice a week for six months slowly increasing the resistance. Seems to be going well.

Kickstand  WHY?! skip this I would.. Lube   Everything? what is that? more details.. if theyre giving you shorts and a jersey that might be a .. what exactly does this entail?Basically what I listed above is  fitting should be free.. so I guess based on where you live there might be a Sales TaxVAT..My advice if you like the bike get it and get a helmet from the shop.. everything else buy online as you need it. There are plenty of websites that offer reasonable pricing. If you want to keep money in your community great buy at your LBS but when you need it!EDIT On second thought look further the  is a mountain bike if youre looking to ride around town you probably need a hybridcomfort bike.

Its stronger and harder than what we refer to as highten or high tensile steel that allows bike makers to use lighter weight tubes to make a bike thats just as strong.The bike looks like its in pretty great shape.

1561717,0,t3_2c51yu,If you browse this sub by top posts you only really see the good New Bike Day posts the ones comprised of good photos nice bikes or interesting stories. If you browse by new you see that most NBD posts arent like that.  I think thats the source of the complaints. To me the issue is that people here want to talk about bikes and bicycling but the majority of NBD posts are a bad photo of a common bike with no context about the purchase. Those dont engage people at all. Would people browse rcars if it was just photos of Toyota Corollas? The OPs clearly want their bike to get some attention or generate discussion but they dont give readers anything to talk about.However those posts could be made interesting if the OPs included context about what makes the bike so special to them whether it be a gateway to exercise new transportation or its got some interesting components. I think forcing that information to be part of the NBD posts is an easy way to improve the quality of one of the most common types of posts in this sub. ,bicycling,cjc18js,5,t5_2qi0s

1575500,0,t3_2cb84k,The problem here is that a thief will in the right circumstances take anything.  It doesnt matter if its bolted down because bolts can be undone.  Which if Im reading right is sort of what happened here.We can talk about the right combination of thick cable locks and Ulocks all day and night long  it doesnt matter because all of those locks can be frozen with easily accessible materials and rendered useless.  There are videos of bike thieves cutting down trees to steal a bike.  A tree seems like a sturdy thing to lock to but it only takes a few seconds to get through one with the right kind of equipment.  When at home the best place to keep your bikes is inside your home.  That way it requires a home invasion to steal them.  Locking your bike outside your home for countless hours is never a good idea no matter how shitty it might be to keep the bike inside an apartment shared house or whatever.  When out in public well thats a problem with so many variables that it becomes its own separate discussion.,bicycling,cjdrj5b,6,t5_2qi0s

1584179,0,t1_cjeudoh,No there is not a zone where we burn more fat total.  There is a zone where we burn more fat as a percentage but that has everything to do with the limited rate at which one can liberate adipose tissue.But as uvhalros said if one exercises harder than zone  zone  it isnt as if adipose liberation goes down in real numbers  it just goes down in terms of the percentage of total calories being consumed. And againt as uvhalros rightfully points out  one is still creating a caloric deficit which means the offsetting of calories which would otherwise get stored.slower is more often better is true simply because most people who are not highly trained are unable to burn in total as many calories through highintensity workouts as they are through longer periods of low intensity.

1596689,0,t1_cjgff2m,You made it seem like you were by drawing the connection with red lights yourself. I think if anything this proves why breaking red lights as a cyclist is not such a massive issue because you need to be very vigilant at all times even when you theoretically have the right of way. Cycling in London it often seems to me the only difference between going through a red light and going through a green light is at the red light you expect to need to look out for people and give way to them.

1596800,0,t1_cjgfvjg,I read one of your other posts and admit that your thoughts make sense. I even agree with them in a way but in reality its a little more complicated.The whole its safer if a cyclist picks up speed by crossing the red safely point is a good one. However from my point of view a lot of the animosity towards cyclists by drivers stem from god damn cyclists thinking its OK to break the rules. That animosity can grow and then you get more aggressive drivers that can start to think Ill drive however if the cyclist gets hurt thats his own fault he should get off the road if he cant follow the rules and other similar thoughts.Im not saying that the rules of the road are a holy bible I just choose to think that if I abide by the rules Ill have less hate toward me. I also understand that a driver with a similar thought process as yours would think ugh stupid cyclist why didnt he just make it easier by running the red earlier?

1600984,0,t3_2ck8fv,Yeah see there were no cars coming in that video so in NY like many other places bikes tend to run traffic signals when there are no vehicles coming. Pedestrians tend to do this too. The reason is simple. Outside or your car you have more situational awareness then inside. You can hear cars coming. See in every direction. So had there been cars coming in this video I bet your fellow bikers would have stopped. Since there were no cars coming who cares they ran the light? Have you ever ran a stop sign when you were certain no cars were on the approach?Are you doing anything wrong? Nope. P.S.

1637105,0,t3_2d21mh,For a long lasting and smooth running drivetrain here are my tips.I clean my bike every time I ride offroad. This may not be needed if your chain is not that dirty. I use some dish soap dawn and drip it on every single link of my chain and then use an old toothbrush and an old rag to get my chain clean. Then I put some of the soap on the toothbrush and then clean every single cog on the cassette while backpedalling. After that I clean my chainrings from the front and rear and rinse the bike off after cleaning all the other parts. I put my bike in the sun for about an hour and bounce it around to make sure it is completely dry and then I lube the chain by dripping  drops in every single link and then backpedal for about  minutes to make sure the lube has penetrated into the links. Last but not least I grab an old rag and remove excess lube from the side of the links to keep the chain clean for as long as possible  and then Im ready for my next ride! Note I use dry lube Joes eco lube because I live in a very dry climate and wet lube is a dirt magnet here. It keeps my drivetrain running smooth and it attracts very little dirt.,bicycling,cjlisoe,1,t5_2qi0s

A comfortably fitting bike will mean you will want to use it. If you by a bike thats not your size you will quickly lose interest and not use it. Find out what size you need. Buy one in your size.

It is also wrong to assume just because the Dutch dont put helmets on their kids which I dont even know if its true I dont have any data and your four pictures arent really representative its a viable thing to do. Dutch people do dumb shit too you know? And not having your kid wear a bike helmet is dumb shit bluntly stated.Also people drinking themselves to death is a huge problem the world over and it hasnt been decisively legislated against.

1882300,0,t1_ckfuo5h,Ive had the Empires for about . years. The laces have been pretty good. The elastic strap on the tongue keeps them in place so there is zero worry about them going into the chain. My feet do shrink over the course of a ride so the shoes will feel looser after half an hour. When I get a chance I will retie the shoes midride but if I leave them loose its not much difference.For what little hassle laces bring its definitely worth it for the comfort.  You get eight places along the tongue to distribute tension instead of the  places you get with straps or boa laces. Ive had shoes with poorly placed ratchets or boas that dig into the top of my foot because of the hard plasticmetal attachment hardware. Theres none of that with laces.

I was on my way to work and about half a block from the stop sign when a cop exited his vehicle which was parked on the opposite sidewalk about  or so car lengths on the other side of the intersection and walked across the street jay walked across the street and stood in the door zone looking my way.  Given the amount of drugs slung around that neighborhood I glanced back to see what dealer he was watching but saw no one.When I got to the stop sign I stopped as I always do and basically did a track stand until it was my turn.  I crossed the intersection and started to merge out into the lane because the officer was still standing there and thats when he held up his hand feet shoulder width apart and said halt! it was hard not to laugh.  I stopped asked him what the problem was and he said that I didnt stop at the stop sign.I told him that I did indeed stop at the stop sign and he told me that a bicyclist must place both feet on the ground standing over the bike in order to come to a complete stop. I explained that while the definition of a street legal bike is one in which the rider can straddle the top tube the vehicle code does not state that that is what must happen at a stop.  He pulled out his abridged edition of the vehicle code to prove me wrong and I explained that the vehicle code cant fit in ones pocket I pulled out my phone and brought up the vehicle code on the State website and he still told me I was was wrong.  I told him that we should just agree to disagree I apologized for not fully dismounting and told him that from then on Id fully dismount and he whipped out his ticket book and asked for my ID.Since I already lost while he was writing my ticket I asked him why he jay walked even though thats against the law and he told me that an officer can break laws when apprehending someone I asked him who he was apprehending an he said that it was me. So I pointed out that he jaywalked before I had even gotten to the stop sign which means he wasnt acting in his official capacity when he broke the law and I also pointed out that officers must use their lights and sirens when making illegal traffic maneuvers but his lights were still off and he made some tell it to the judge quip and handed me my ticket.At court I explained what had happened explained that I attempted to educate the officer as to the vehicle as it pertains to cyclists etc. I even told the just the laws that the officer broke including parking on the sidewalk and the judge dismissed everything and then laid in to the officer about not knowing the laws hes enforcing no relenting when being proven wrong etc.I was quite taken by surprise by the judges actions not the dismissing of my ticket but of railing in the cop but then I noticed  his bikey coffee mug.,bicycling,ckkmkgr,15,t5_2qi0s

Considering he was riding the aerobars Im going to guess he was going at least the speed limit so its definitely safer to ride outside the bike lane.  Whether the law is worded to allow that who knows.  But in no way was this a factor in the accident and theoretically could have prevented it as the cyclist should have had more room to maneuver around the pedestrian though this obviously didnt happen.gt Basically he sounds like hes the kind of asshole who lays on his horn and not slow down for a pedestrian in the crosswalk when hes in his car instead of on his bike and now somebody else has paid for it.To be fair we dont have video of this incident.  Maybe she was jaywalking and he had a green light.

1982792,0,t3_2heuzk,Oh man old french bikes..... take care of the components that are on there cause youll have a hell of a time replacing themThe bottom bracket is likely to be French thread. The only replacement available these days is Phil Wood   plus the proprietary tool to install it. Pull the BB out and freshen up the grease and bearings.The fork steertube is probably slightly smaller diameter than normal and all are no longer made in the original size. This means if the stem fork or headset go you need to replace all three parts with modern standard plus mill the head tube to .mm to accept a modern headset. Plus youll need to very carefully sand down the stem where the shifters mount so the clamp will fit or replace the shifters.The seatpost is probably some weird diameter. These are readily available if yours needs to be replaced but you can trash the frame if you jam the wrong size in. Pull steel wool off the dirt and rust and grease.The front derailleur is probably some weird obsolete clamp size and will have some brittle plastic parts. Be very gentle handling it. If you need to replace it youll need to shim the clamp on your replacement.The rear derailleur and shifters both have that same brittle plastic  be gentle when working on them. You might want to preemptively replace the rear derailleur because those old Simplexes are pretty crappy.

The saddle is on a strap so the balancing is really good cant still sit on my bike standing still though  and the shock absorbtion is phenominal also the strap is loose so it is helping you to keep your balance in sharp turns specially when you are driving slow.But the small con in it is that you have a high surface area because you are almost standing up but I think it is compensated when the momentum you can get from the bike.My experience with the bike is that it is a really good road bike for when you want to cruise around and relax because you sit upright on the bike but that you also can use it to come at really high speeds.My highest recorded speed on a flat road with almost no wind is kph.And sorry for any grammatical errors my native language isnt english.tldrSpeed Balance Comfort Fun Looks Edit added tldr and wordEdit words and overview,bicycling,ckv555f,6,t5_2qi0s

2025573,0,t3_2hy7as,Happy for all the progress you are making! keep up the positive work Im rooting for you brother.  I understand that mindset of Im not like these other addicts and I thought the same thing about my self for so long. This defiantly ensured me relapsing. I got clean for a little bit and thought I dont rob or steal or deal drugs and Ive never O.D. Im in control so I started using and ended up selling whatever drugs I could find so I could have more money for my drug of choice. Got clean for a bit went to N.A. after a week or so clean I was telling myself Yeah I sell drugs but i never robbed or stolen anything havent O.D. and I still have the same job. Started using again this time harder one day i woke up and lost three days I still dont remember a damn thing that happened for those three days. But I didnt go to work and lost my Job. So I stopped using for a little bit then that addict brain kicked back in and it said to me still havent robbed or stolen or went to the hospital. Guess what happened next? I overdosed on heroin I honestly shouldnt be here even the doctors and nurses and RTs all said that they dont understand how I even lived. And that still wasnt enough In fact as soon as I got home I used what drugs that were stashed in my apartment. This eventually lead me to stealing money and manipulating people into giving me money I never ended up robbing people violently or through intimidation however I now believe that stealing and taking advantage of people really isnt too far from it.    And that is what is great about meetings and sponsors when you find someone that has a firm foot planted in sobriety and you are comfortable talking with them. Then they can let you know when your addict brain to talking we need someone to help us call out bullshit because we are constantly trying to bullshit ourselves.,bicycling,ckxakj5,6,t5_2qi0s

2053495,0,t3_2iaqdn,Im a recent industrial design graduate and passionate cyclist. Lately its started getting dark in the evenings when I ride and Ive developed the following unpopular opinionLights suck. In a word night blindnessUnless you live out in the middle of the woods in the middle of no where its really not that dark. In the countryside around Amsterdam even an hour after the sun has set visibility is quite good. I can see the road people cars everything.That is until I pass a car or a scooter or another cyclist. Their super safe bright LEDs cause super night blindness. I can no longer make out what is a car and what is  cyclists side by side because I can see only blackness with two dots of light. It also becomes a hundred times more difficult to judge speed when Im looking at only a dot of light. I started turning off my own lights as well to avoid doing that to people and because they do a crap job of illuminating the road ahead of me and also induce moderate night blindness in myself when the brightest thing in my field of vision is the front edge of my handlebars.Then the other day I noticed all the joggers were out at night. But all they had was a dull red blinking around their arm and it seemed the  joggers I passed all had this same light. It was perfect. It was plenty enough to catch my eye but didnt induce night blindness for either of us i saw them and they saw me. Im thinking about buying one or two for me and my bike because Im so sick of these lights.The other real irony is that most older bikes here have a wheel powered light that doesnt really have these problems. It emits a nice yellow light over the ground in front of the bike so they can see where theyre going and I can see the lighter splotch bouncing along the ground for a mile away without completely losing my sense of sight.In any case this issue has slowly been driving me nuts and Im really excited to see people trying to think of new lighting solutions.,bicycling,cl0uewt,0,t5_2qi0s

As long as theyre far enough apart to not rub the rim at any point and not so far that you cant completely contact the rim before bottoming out the brake lever its all preference.Absolutely bent.

Dont worry it will feel less awkward soon enough.I dont think it has to do with which side you unclip first as much as the fact that clipless pedals are awkward and scary which confounds your normal sense of balance.Maybe spend a day practicing this on your street or a parking lot before you get back out there.

2184007,0,t3_2k329t,I think youd really want to see the bike to work out what you could live with. You really cant tell from a photo if the parts all tighten well together that theres no play in the brakes that the wheels are true and so on.The frame geometry is ringing an alarm for me. A forwardsloping top tube means a larger rear triangle and thus more weight. Its a very odd design choice. I wonder if its meant to give a more aggressive look to the bike at the cost of actual performance.The wheels are very much in the look good camp. Consider that theyve got a tight design budget. And theyve spent it adding red tyres and coloured spokes. The concept itself seems odd from a mechanical point of view both deep rims and a high spoke count?If you need a cheap bike then secondhand or a end of yearbranded stock runout is the best way to go. Mainly because of the reliability. The first time you have to repair your commuter bike in the office after work so that you can get home then you are losing. Fixing a flat sure. Replacing a bent brake caliper you dont want to be there. These sort of bikes also run the risk that they wont be using typicallysized products so shopping for a replacement part during lunchtime might be unsuccessful.Oftentimes people wont listen. So tell them to buy what their heart is set on. That will at least give them enough motivation to get out into the outdoors.

I was hauling ass in the bike lane when a young kid maybe between  and  jumped out into my lane looked toward me and laughed. He was intentionally blockingn my path and the mother saw him do it and did nothing. There wasnt really enough room to brake safely and if Id attempted to I would have just landed on the kid vertically which isnt much better. I managed to swerve onto the grass as it was thankfully in a part of the path without a curb. But if I had hit the kid I would feel no guilt whatsoever.  the kids fault except perhaps also the parents fault for intentionally ignoring the danger that her child was creating against itself and others.

2245200,0,t1_clp0765,So let me understand you correctly. If another person intentionally causes an accident by tuning into traffic the person who had more momentum at the time is inherently at fault? Thats just utterly silly. Merely being a pedestrian or child or smaller object does not absolve a person of responsibility for his or her actions. And you as a cyclist are not required to violate the laws of physics to prevent others from intentionally causing accidents. Again nobody reads the relevant facts and just goes straight to generalizing for value judgments. I get the impression that your pith is responding to a straw man version of me that wishes death and dismemberment on all children who have the misfortune of a parent taking them to a park. That is not in any way actually similar to a view that I posed here. I responded to people talking about feeling guilty over accidents that arent in any way their fault by explaining with an even clearer example that a pedestrian can perfectly well be responsible for the consequences of their own actions. In regard to liability its not an opinion. Its a legal conclusion and that part of the process is indeed intentionally heartless because a society where liability was determined by emotions would be fundamentally dysfunctional. gtYou sound like an upstanding human being. I do hope you dont drive.I am a pretty damn upstanding human thank you. I drive far more than I would like to the point that Ive actually got my  hours in for expertise. Im probably better able to avoid such a collision in my car than on a bike solely on account of experience and control. Also I seldom drive in places where children intentionally and suddenly block traffic and when dogs chase cars they seldom catch them. Oh I suppose youd feel I should also feel bad for the dog that gets hurt chasing me down on my bike right? There are in fact times when the car is safer for all involved parties but only because people usually act a little smarter around cars as they actually comprehend that theres momentum involved. My situation that I described above was terrifying from my perspective. You clearly werent there. How do you feel so justified in judging my response? The kid was wrong. I wasnt alone and the people that I was with reacted the same way. If I hadnt managed to avert the collision it would have absolutely been the kids fault because he literally intentionally tried to cause the accident. When you intentionally cause an accident its no longer an accident but an attack. In what world is it not the fault of the attacker when harm results from the attack? Its not even a matter of disproportionate response if my response is merely to dissipate kinetic energy that my body already possessed before the attack. And legally and firstyear law student knows that a child who intentionally causes an accident is indeed at fault and can be sued even if he himself also got hurt in the process. ,bicycling,clp7uhl,1,t5_2qi0s
2246204,0,t3_2kt85y,At   and pulling in at  I can relate to your troubles. I ride daily for training and commuting and found that I was ripping through wheels to the tune of  back wheels each year and  front wheels each year. My solution to this has been to have a custom build done. My daily trainer wheels are are    Mavic CXP s ultegra hubs laced with DT Swiss Alpine IIIs brass nipples avoid the alloy if you are able to put down a lot of power. Once they push these through a stress box a handful of times the wheels are pretty bomb proof and cant speak highly enough of the build. I now get about  months use on the back and a little over a year on the front for my daily beaters. My race wheels are generally left on the wall until race day so I dont burn through them nearly so fast. ,bicycling,clpcg5n,2,t5_2qi0s

2319596,0,t1_clya1le,Rack and pannier design also factor in when it comes to heel strike. For example consider a rack like this A large pannier mounted very far back on the rack can swing into the wheel because the rear strut makes such a steep angle. Personally I prefer racks that have a dogleg strut at the rear to prevent this. Good panniers will have the abliity for the mounting points to be adjusted to fit the rack. Otherwise you can end up with a situation where the panniers have to be mounted further forward that necessary. This can happen if  when the pannier is positioned as desired a mounting point sits at the same place as the intersection between the struts and the mounting rail.Also it is worth noting that putting a very long or setback rack on a bike with race geometry can cause the bike to handle poorly with a large load.,bicycling,clyezpv,1,t5_2qi0s

A lot of people will never see the day that happens or theyll just break the pedals on a fall of some sort and never ride again.Quick relevant story from this weekend. I purchased a new Salsa Mukluk fat bike mountain bike and threw some plastic flats on from the shop  much like these. I wanted to go ride before swapping normal pedals so I headed out with these. They worked fine basically. I did my loop and then for the exit of my trail ride I decided to push the bike and see what it had. I ended up getting a second fastest time on one of the downhill sections that I had trained on all race season.The pedals obviously held for me but when I got down to the bottom the outside cage had been started to separate from the inside of the pedal on BOTH pedals. This was a lt hour ride no less. Theyre not super tough but they will allow you to ride the bike for a time.,bicycling,cm6al6s,4,t5_2qi0s

Gorgeous frame Ive never seen lug work that nice in person.  Probably hand built by Carltons tendencies though I never bothered to check.  Wonderful ride excellent commuter.  Would have felt comfortable upgrading on that frame if I hadnt sold the bike for space.  The steel tendency toward ride quality gives a pretty smooth ride too with a good design.Entry level track bikes Fuji Track Specialized Langster Bianchi Pista.Road bikes You can often find stuff with sp  on sale well under .  My bike was not a particularly good sale or anything but it has a superb quality aluminum frame and SRAM Apex which I am quite happy with since SRAM functionality isnt crazy different over their lineup.You could get a superb commuter for that kind of money.Basically there are things that are necessary for a good quality bike and that comes at different price thresholds for different disciplines and reasons.

When on the ride keep hydrated and eat regularly. I would keep my stops short   minutes so as not to cool down too much. Somethings that can make the ride much more difficult are hills or head or cross winds. Allow for that. Have a backup plan an alternate destination where you can spend the night. I would not have a problem with an MTB. As a matter of fact I would prefer it. Less likely to have flats and the more upright position would be more comfortable for me. If I was going in an MTB I would equip it with handlebar extensions that would allow for a more aerodynamic position in headwinds.  Ive done two centuries at age  and  The first time took  hours and  minutes and I completed the second in  hours  minutes.

2735343,0,t1_cnelub0,Theres a weird dissymmetry that is built into the rules.  For example Women can ride in stages in the TDF.  But not compete in the entire event.I dont think forcing a team to have a woman or two on the roster is acceptable  this is the pinnacle of road cycle racing.  But to not allow them to compete over the entire  days seems silly to me.  Womens cycling is growing now AFAIK  at least in reputation.  So the UCIs short course stage max race limitations dont seem to be grounded on a whole lot.  I happen to enjoy watching womens racing  it seems like a better representation of the sport to me especially on TV.  Id love to watch the best of the ladies go up the Alpsfly through the TT course before or even after the men set off.  Heck if they wanted they could make each course a  day affair  women ride a day early then the men come through the next day.  That way you can see different weather affecting each stage which would be interesting to see.The problem is that the UCI bends over backwards for money  so it caters to the sponsors and media.

Do it a few mm at a time and ride the bike. The further back the saddle is the less weight you carry on your hands. Imagine when you squat your butt moves backwards to help you balance the same thing happens on the bike. But you cant just slam the saddle all the way back because that can ruin your pedal stroke so move it back a few mm at a time. ,bicycling,cnkocm9,2,t5_2qi0s

I have never seen someone riding something like that around not even the tour cyclists out in the countryside so I cant really imagine what its useful for. It is not the ideal solution for lots of small pieces of cargo and its also not a good solution for one really big piece of cargo either. Design wise it just feels stupid like someone said How do we make a good cargo bike? and the first idea was Easy! Just add more racks EVERYWHERE! rather than Maybe we need to rethink the structure of the bicycle to account for a lower centre of gravity and a single versatile box for large and small items.So I guess Im talking more as an industrial designer than a Dutch guy.

2884314,0,t3_2t5fm4, miles a week isnt that informative. If youre doing that in one ride youd expect some soreness.But I am more inclined to think that youre maybe doing  in one trip. In that case youve simply got the usual exercise issues. too much weight too early. A lot of beginning cyclists push too high a gear. Sacrifice a few Kmh and increase your cadence rpm is low rpm is high. Get a cycle computer with cadence even a low end wired model. When going uphill you should be changing down in advance of the load and certainly not ending up in the cadence trap where you push a high gear early in the hill and bonk before the top. Be kind to yourself when starting out on a hill like a lot if exercise a reverse split is the aim. not warming up and down not stretching. The first and last few Km you should just be flicking the pedals over not taking a load. Sit up take in the sunshine. Then do some leg stretches. Nutrition is by the numbers. Kj or calories is king. Count them in count them out. Apps like MyFitnessPal have all sorts of issues but the one thing they do well is account for Kj in. Basically you can be on any diet you like best if the numbers work. If you ride every day then remember that the nutrition goes in before the ride. This isnt so much because you need access to it ie it doesnt have to be sugars but because appetite is suppressed after a ride. So a big breakfast normal lunch small dinner.Water is simple drink before you are thirsty. When cycling youll soon get the feel right  that so full I am sloshing feeling is particularly uncomfortable so every half hour fill up short of that.,bicycling,cnvy615,6,t5_2qi0s

3102344,0,t1_cojdq1a,The safest route isnt the sidewalk as discussed numerous places If anything youre risking the safety of yourself and pedestrians by riding on the sidewalk.A responsible cyclist takes the lane where he can be seen. Riding on the sidewalk means youre not as visible and putting pedestrians and drivers coming out of driveways or crossing intersections at risk.Expectations have everything to do with safety. The fact that you dont understand this demonstrates your lack of knowledge on the subject. If a driver doesnt expect a cyclist to be in the sidewalk and crossing which most dont theyll hit them leavingentering driveways or turning at intersections. Drivers dont expect quickly moving cyclists to cross a crosswalk when they havent been seen in the turning process.If a driver sees a cyclist in the road the expectation is that theyre acting like a vehicle  which is what they should be doing both legally and for safety. The recommendation is to ride in the middle of the lane so you can be seen from both directions if theres no bike lane.Certainly its not wise to cycle on a  mph road but a cyclist is legally allowed to except in areas where the law is otherwise.  mph roads arent likely to have sidewalks to begin with as theyre usually freeways or highways.

3212242,0,t3_2wwv4i,Welcome. Theres nothing about qualifications. The poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich can bike just like someone can own an old honda civic or a brand new Cadillac. There are many ways to approach bicycling as a sport as a mode of transit as a way to vacation etc.Get something with good brakes. Yes everyone wants to be Mary Poppins with her giant cruiser and cables detract from that stylistically. But if a kick brake is your only brake you should know that those things can overheat and fail or have the chain snap or fall off and then you have no brakes except you know running into something at high speed. So a hand brake in addition to a coaster brake is an absolute must. Giants Simple  or Giant Simple  are both great starter bikes that sell for around  brand new. Theyre good starter bikes that sit you in a posture youre probably familiar with the sit pattern is like driving a car.Riding a bike is not like sitting in a chair for a few reasons. Firstly in a chair or car seat your back is supported by back supports. This means your butt is taking like  of your weight. On a bike there is no back support so the way to take weight off the base of your spine is to either have enormous tires and a gigantic sprung saddle which weighs a lot and adds to chafing between the legs or to have the riders hands take some of the upper body weight.So this will be a little uncomfortable especially at first as your body adjusts to a saddle note Im saying Saddle not Seat because its not supposed to take all your weight and as your arm muscles build up but thats fine.But there are workarounds. Try this for example Its got springs loaded underneath designed to absorb more impacts. This adds weight to the bike naturally but it is great for beginner riders and women riders who tend to prefer less pressure on certain parts.Heres one that ships in USACanada.Hybrids right now are all the rage. They supposedly offer the sportiness of a road bike but in reality they have a low top speed because wind resistance is a major factor there with an upright posture which is good for looking over your shoulder in traffic. People unfortunately arent happy with hybrids asis. They tend to shove the stems as far up as they can go sometimes even higher. Basically they do THIS which is honestly a bit silly since its supposed to look like THIS Most of these people are entrylevel bicyclists who are looking for something they assume will be comfortable which they think means as close to seated like when Im riding in my car as is possible. Ive explained the difference already but again the difference is that in a car you have a back and neck support. Bikes dont have those. So its actually better to lean forward and put more weight on your hands than it is to be straight up and down unless the bikes saddle and geometry is designed for this from the groundup. Cruisers amp speeds specifically.If you have any questions about buying a used bike or something just PM me or someone else in the subreddit remind us who you are with your search criteria price range what youre using it for etc. and well help you find something that will work for you.Good luck welcome to the club and ride safe!,bicycling,couy6r1,5,t5_2qi0s

3268993,0,t3_2xkaea,Youre pretty much right. Especially about flat bar shift systems I rarely notice a difference in on road use with any of the hybridMTB stuff. Obviously the stiff springs of the clutched shimano derailers etc. affect off road riding a lotRoad has always seemed a bit more finicky to me on the lower end stuff. sora is just fine doesnt feel quite as good as  but not a huge difference. I would steer clear of Claris though. Ive put together more bikes than I care to admit with Claris and that thing has really hit or miss shifting. I can set up a Tiagra system in the blink of an eye and it will shift perfectly but with Claris its a constant battle tweaking the B tension making fine adjustments to the limits and trying to get that tension just right and there seems to be no room for error. Which leads me to believe its less reliable as weather and use can easily cause that tension to tweak just enough and if were talking about th of a barrel adjustment turn being the difference between good shifting and not shifting without skipping around I just feel unsure of it out on long rides.,bicycling,cp0w4ck,1,t5_2qi0s

3318823,0,t1_cp67rzb,this x . I cant even count how many times Ive seen local folks bitching on facebook about how dangerous it is for cyclist to be on certain local roads.  Saying things like cyclists are going to cause a wreck force cars off the road etc.  The roads they are referencing are somewhat curvy with a mph speed limit suggested less than  in many of the curves.  Its not the cyclists that are the danger. What is really happening and what theyre really bitching about is that these drivers dont want to be bothered with going just the speed limit.  They drive   or more and want to be able to without worry glance at their cell as often as they please.Cyclist on these roads are nothing more than a minor inconvenience if the driver is driving the speed limit while keeping both eyes on the road.  Absolutely no reason in the world that you cant spot a rider and slow down enough until theres enough room and sight distance to safely pass. However that would require just a smidgen of selflessness self control and concentration.   ,bicycling,cp6koie,2,t5_2qi0s

3783916,0,t1_cqnkbn1,gt RuthlesslyI agree it wouldnt be fair to punish these people as much as I would like to.  But I wonder if being unfair in a few highprofile examples would change the general behavior.Again Im not expecting people to stop making mistakes.  Im hoping for them to stop making stupid and avoidable decisions such a driving drunk or driving recklessly around pedestrians and cyclists.Ive had cars race by me way too close easily within arms reach on onelane streets simply because they were impatient.  It doesnt happen often maybe once or twice per year.But the point is that one mistake by a driver during these stunts could put me in the hospital or leave me with a huge copay for physical therapy or something like that.I hope Im explaining myself well.  Im not trying to demonize the generallyresponsible drivers who have one accident.  Im talking about the ones that make a conscious decision to endanger others for their own convenience whether its deciding to drive to the bar to save yourself cab fare or deciding to recklessly pass a cyclist when there isnt enough space just because you dont want to wait.Drivers will always make mistakes.  This is an unavoidable fact and we have to live with it.  But I do not think we need to tolerate the type of attitude I described e.g. my convenience is worth more than safety.If we can discourage this attitude by unfairly punishing a few reckless drivers Id say its worthwhile.  And especially in a case like this when the driver showed absolutely no remorse people will have a hard time feeling sorry for the guy.gt Ive had a handful of near misses and never any maliceIve experienced malice.  I guess it just depends on where you are.I think Im a pretty responsible biker  I stop at all red lights I signal my turns I take bike lanes wherever possible even if it adds distance to my commute etc.  So Ive become convinced that the fortunately rare malice I get from drivers is entirely a result of their toxic attitude.I think this has been a big factor in why I hold these views.  When I was getting chased down a onelane street by a pickup who kept threateningly revving his engine and lurching towards me I thought to myself Someday this guy is going to hit someone and when he does I hope he goes to jail for a long long time. Sure no one deserves to rot in jail for an accident.  But when your accident follows a pattern of this type of behavior do you really deserve any forgiveness?  Is it really a mistake?  I would argue that its not a mistake.  Its a conscious choice that took a while to catch up to him.  And I would argue that this applies to those who decide to drive drunk as well.P.S. Sorry for the wall of text.  I feel pretty strongly about this issue.,bicycling,cqnlg20,3,t5_2qi0s

I could tell this gentlemen did not hear me.So I really spoke up I yelled full volume from about  feet away HEY BUDDY!. He was shocked swerved his bike pretty hard and almost lost control between trying to fiddle his ear bud out of his ear and being startled. He immediately apologized Oh man wow I was in the zone sorry!. I said no problem laughed with him about it apologized for scaring him so much but that I wanted us both to be safe when I passed him. Everyone was cool about the situation though I bet his heart was racing faster than mine as I paced past him.Thing was though its kind of scary how unaware he was about the situation behind him. I actually dont really care if someone has a stereo or speaker hanging off their bike and it broadcasts music all around plenty of motorcycles have this too. In fact I prefer it.

3977844,0,t3_35zo31,A nice general guide for determining general value of old bikes     Usually though not always the  most immediately obvious tells generally visible even in fuzzy Craigslist photos that indicate youve got an entry level vintage bike on your hands are if it has turkey levers sometimes called safety or alternately suicide levers  brake extensions so that the entry level consumer could feel comfortable braking from the top of the bars vs the hoods or drops and if it has stem shifters right up by the top of the handlebars vs bar end or down tube which were generally positioned there for same reason as safety levers and are often a good indication of poorer components though not always.  This one has both the turkey levers and the stem shifters.  If youre actually looking at the bike in person then you can get a better look at components and such.  If there are stickers or labels on the seat tube those will be a big indicator of the quality of the frame itself something you cant upgrade or switch out like you can with components!.  If you see hiten then youre looking at something rather heavy.  If you see Reynolds  Columbus SL Tange Prestige... then youre looking at quality steel.  It might also say triple butted or double butted  also good indicators.  That all said depends on weight of rider and intended use often quality is skewed towards for winning races which...  Too thin and light and it might get flexy especially for larger heavier riders or people wanting to pack a lot of gear and often for touring bikes you want a little more heft there youll see Reynolds  ST or Tange No  etc,bicycling,cr9phmm,2,t5_2qi0s

His form out of the saddle is very good one of the better ones Ive seen although hes riding on a treadmill and not banging shoulders with riders in a pack or sprinting but his bike moves very little laterally and his torso isnt taking the brunt of the activity.

I have adjusted the brakes and reindexed the rear derailleur though.If youve modified it what did you do and why?Added a water bottle cage saddle bag pump and ULock. I added these because riding for any period of time in sunny SoCal without water is... not smart. Lock is for making sure nobody walks off with one of my wheels. The rest is so I can repair it in case something happens.What sort of riding do you do on it?Mostly exercise at the moment but I am planning on using it to commute to and from class as well as grocery shopping if I eventually get panniers. What do you love about it?I just love how great it looks! If you werent looking for it the bike lock almost looks like part of the frame and I love how the bottle cage matches the outer cables. I also love that it has a granny gear since I am completely out of shape and live in an area with big ol hills.What would you change if you had the timemoney to change it?I would probably add drop bars better shiftersand go clipless once I get good enough.

I know specialized makes good stuff I admittedly havent used the VPs but they have a lot of pins and they make a lot of pedals.The ones I personally own are the DMR Vault Pedals but theyre expensive but they worked well for having big feet  Like you said running shoes are not ideal. You want at least  things in a flat shoe  . No padding the compresses and decrompresses while using the shoe some people use skate shoes companies like FiveTen and Chrome make specific flat bottomed shoes for biking  . The bottom of the shoe should be relatively flat so when its on the pedal the pin can dig in. So shoes with really spikey uneven soles are not great shoes with fairly solid flat soles are good.,bicycling,crr99pg,1,t5_2qi0s

4135702,0,t3_37yawk,I ride my nineties MTB  km to work. This goes by in  minutes. Nearly all of it on shared pedestrianbike paths. Pedestrians really get in the way some times particularly in the afternoon and I have to roll by at walking pace. Crossing the roadway is always a hassle if there are no traffic lights drivers and bikers alike hesitate to cross. The pavement is also pretty shitty at places and the dedicated bike path when it exists is too narrow to comfortably meet another biker. But I do really enjoy it most days. Rainy mornings do put sticks in my spokes though. In winter I change out the front tyre to a studded one and hope they plow the bike paths. Training is not part of commuting in my mind.

4205412,0,t3_391p3f,First off I think your ratio is wrong.  I think he used .  Thats what a few sources on Google are telling me at least and  feels too low.But to address your thinking heres my thoughtsHe could have chosen   or  to get nearly the same gear ratio.  These are the same ratio to within . . and . respectively.  This has nothing to do with cadence were talking  RPM vs . RPM.The biggest reason is that theres an efficiency benefit to having larger gears.  The chain bends less so theres less power lost.  Less power lost to the chain means more power goes to the wheels which means more speed.Now if you ask me the benefit is a bit dubious.  I can only find one reference where someone actually measured the power improvements of having larger gears.  It compared a  vs  and found the efficiency improved from . to ..  At W that means the power lost in the chain went from . W to . W or a difference of . W.. W is ... tiny to say the least.  But when youre going for a world record maybe its worth while.But look at the gearing that was tested the chainring doubled in size.  Choosing a  would only be a  difference.  So I suspect the difference is more like  W at best.  But hey a watt is a watt.As for belt drive last I heard a belt might be more efficient than a chain at high power which would certainly apply here though research is a bit thin.  I think a bigger problem is that belt drives are banned on track bikes Ive heard this but I dont know it for a fact and the hour record must be on tracklegal equipment.,bicycling,crzlud0,5,t5_2qi0s

4308341,0,t1_csb8rr5,So two points here  You shouldnt try to adjust your posture by adjusting the seat up and down  you should be doing it by adjusting the handlebars up and down.  Your seat is already too low. Youre not supposed to be able to stand on the saddle and have your feet touch the ground. Your seat height should be such that when a pedal is at the bottom of the stroke your knee is just slightly bent. Check youtube  like so This might seem unstable at first but youll get used to it. You can very easily hurt your knees by having the saddle too low so its very well worth the effort to do it right. ,bicycling,csb9xsd,4,t5_2qi0s

Quality is timeless and I would expect those DuraAce parts to still be top drawer compared to todays in many cases Shimanos higher end stuff from that period is legendary and more durable than the complicated stuff with more speeds of today.

You say there would have been obviously no way to pass when in fact there was that entire adjacent lane temporarily empty of oncoming traffic! Thats an obvious way to pass as demonstrated by both vehicles going way over into it despite the double white lines. Sure its blatantly illegal to do that but it didnt seem to deter these drivers... so why would you expect riding in primary to have made any difference?

4499219,0,t3_3cpjom,Ive been riding Sectors on Stans Grails for about two weeks. Previously I was running Continental Touring Plus on stock wheels so the change was substantial. Ive really loved them so far but it probably helps that my new setup is about  lbs lighter than the old one maybe more. I havent had a chance to do any gravel riding on them but road riding has been great. Im still playing with pressure but Im running  psi front and ish rear with  lbs riderbike weight and the tires do what theyre supposed to  roll well and absorb road chatter.I was surprised at how easy they were to set up I was able to get the tires on the rim by hand without much difficulty no tire lever needed though I used a small portable compressor to seat the beads since I own one. They still leak a little bit something like  psi over  hrs not sure if that will get better eventually but I always check my pressure before every ride anyways.Here is another guys thoughts which convinced me to get the Sectors in case he doesnt see this and chime in.,bicycling,csxs4qm,2,t5_2qi0s

B I have and drilling there wont really be a problem as carbon is laid unidirectionally at the base meaning strength in all directions. Even then you lay multiple layers in different orientations when you wrap or lay so strength in all directions. When people build things they build them yes to have strength in some areas with preference over others. However carbon doesnt just... hmm how do I put this when you make a bike you dont lay up the carbon so its only unidirectionally strong. You can see a mild version of this in endurance bikes with bendy seatstays but other than that carbon is going to be stiff all around EVEN if you lay it up unidirectionally. There are chances of cracks but if you drill it correctly and in areas of low strain you might get away with it. Ergo a small hole like that wont affect the integrity unless its at some major strain point.C Top tube? No problems.  Chain stay? Now that could be dicy but depending on the size and actual placement he may be fine. May. Be.D Everybody who agreed with this who hasnt built anything out of carbon is just perpetuating the circlejerk of perceived intelligence on the internet.

But more and more you hear about riders being accosted by a person in a car for the only reason that he has a problem with bike riders the typical scenario is a car running a bike rider off the road and then pulling over to and I quote from a u tube video from a helmet cam I am going to teach you a lesson. As the guy comes at the rider with a baseball bat.  now I ride with my wife and young kids at times and I will protect them at any cost that is my choice if you decide to watch some nut job beat the crap out of your wife or kids then that is your rite to do so but if it dose happen keep in mind that you made the decision to become a victim.  BTW I posses a consealed weapons permit and have have extensive training for my job and anyone happening to pull on a person for something as you described needs to go to jail for assault with a deadly weapon but if some asshole runs me or my family off the road just because and wants to accost us well that person is going down ,bicycling,cty7jpk,-3,t5_2qi0s

4849356,0,t1_cu5s38c,I would recommend locking the rear wheel to a solid object by putting your lock preferably a ulock in between the seat stay and rear wheel. This is called the Sheldon method. If your lock is big enough you can lock the front wheel with it as well. If not the front wheel can be locked with a cable lock or if you seriously need more security a second ulock. Put the cable through the front wheel and frame and seat if you wish and lock it using the ulock. If the cable includes a lock lock it with that. Thieves might bring ulock tools or cable tools but rarely both. NEVER USE REGULAR PADLOCKS. They are really easy to break. Lastly try to lock your bike in a populated area especially around other bikes. Even better lock it to where you yourself can keep an eye on it.,bicycling,cu5span,2,t5_2qi0s

4861538,0,t1_cu76vy3,I commute through some pretty busy streets and intersections and I do this for the increased visibility and safety. I try not to block pedestrians and besides I gain much more in terms of safety than they are inconvenienced by having to move an extra few steps. Given how pedestrians in LA cross ALL THE FUCKING TIME on a flashing red hand donotstartcrossing signal a behavior which is more dangerous for both parties pedestrians and motoristscyclists involved... stopping ahead of the line in the crosswalk should be allowed given that it increases safety for cyclists and motorists and only the dumbest of pedestrians would walk into a stationary bike.Tips taken from a local bike lawyers bloggt  Position yourself to be seen at red lightsgt gt gt Intersections are dangerous places. In fact  of all collisions between cyclists and drivers occur at some sort of road junction. And where you position yourself at a red light can make a big difference in whether or not you join that statistic.gt gt gt gt Once again the key is to make yourself as visible as possible. While some respected sources suggest stopping behind the car ahead of you in my experience thats exactly the wrong place to stop in most cases. Any cars coming up from behind will be focused on the vehicle ahead and may not notice you waiting there behind it.gt gt gt gt Meanwhile if any of the vehicles ahead of you are trucks SUVs or minivans  which is pretty likely these days  you will be completely hidden from view of any oncoming traffic greatly increasing your risk of a left cross collision. And if you are more than one or two cars back from the corner youll probably be hidden from any cross traffic as well.gt gt gt gt So work your way up to the front of the intersection being careful to watch for turning cars and opening doors. Then position yourself in crosswalk just ahead of the through traffic while leaving the right lane clear for turning cars. That way you can be seen from all four directions without blocking any traffic capable of moving before the light changes.gt gt gt gt If any pedestrians are in the crosswalk just smile and politely move out of their way. Then once the light changes move slightly to the right while you cross the intersection allowing the first few cars behind you to pass before you take your place back on the right side of the lane.

4895147,0,t3_3hxh2y,As a Dutch guy nice going! We have these at virtually every larger intersection in the Netherlands. You have replicated it flawlessly.The downside however is that they dont work very well in anywhere with high traffic. Theyre also responsible for some of the most accidentprone intersections in Amsterdam.So oh well about that well keep you guys tuned for when we improve it. PEDIT let me explain the high traffic problem.Imagine this intersection of  ways. We will call one street A and one B.Street A has the green light so several bicycles on B have stopped at the corner and are waiting for their light.Just like drivers cyclists like to inch up to the linelight as much as possible while waiting. What theyve done though is blocked the intersection of A and B bike paths on the corner.A traffic continues streaming on. The first bike manages to squeeze around behind the B bikes without going up the sidewalk but then several more come and they cant get past.Slowly the road in front of the waiting B cars fills up with A bikes as more B bikes have been gathering behind the initial few.The light now changes and the B bikes can proceed. The B cars dont because the A bikes cant continue until B bikes are out of the way AND oncoming traffic from B is now streaming ahead from down the road trying to catch the green light.Not only that but the B bikes now have the same situation as before waiting for them on the other side of the intersection where A bikes who didnt want to get caught in between lights have been gathering.When you step back and think about it you realize this is actually just classic gridlock the bicycle part of the intersection has become a mini city block with  gridlocked intersections at its corners.There are some fixes for this such as moving the lights back so that theres no intersection but Ive only seen it implemented in a few places.,bicycling,cubkmih,64,t5_2qi0s

5072117,0,t1_cuxd62l,No Im not wrong. All this fat burning stuff you read is junk.Trust me here if you want to lose weight dont cycle along slowly never getting out of breath. The exception to that is when you start cycling. When you start cycling then yes absolutely ride along in zone  for  weeks increasing the distance until you hit  miles if you really want to and whoopdedoo youve done your base mileage.Now if you want to lose weight pedal harder. Do intervals. Suffer. Dont argue it just try it and see.Im sure youll also find that most people will not be doing  mph in zone . Theyll be faster. More so if they are in a group.What is mph if its not cycling? In the context of this thread if you read my first reply again youll see I mentioned at the bottom recovery rides.  mph is basically a recovery pace  and as I said in that post theres really no point doing a recovery ride if youve nothing to recover from. Someone who does recovery rides all the time is just not exercising. gt Go ahead and keep on disparaging people Im not disparaging anybody. Im just pointing out some material facts about human sports performance.  miles slowly? Its easy. That should be encouraging to anyone who is starting and who is seeing others posting  miles  the message should be ANYONE CAN DO IT GIVEN  WEEKS OF TRAINING  you shouldnt be acting like its some great achievement just to pander to egos. Cycling  miles slowly is not something you should try to use to make cycling sound difficult or challenging when it isnt. That doesnt encourage cycling. The achievement at the end really isnt a snapshot of a strava screen showing  miles along with some silly humble bragging. The achievement is the fitness you gained from the  weeks training. The actual ride itself and the distance is neither here nor there. Its only  miles due to some strange quirk of humans and numbers. Why not . miles or .?  is meaningless.Winning a TdF stage? Yes thats something we wont do.Ironically you are saying one moment its an accomplishment and saying the next that its ride for fun  make your mind up.Look the thread asked a specific question  why get butthurt about it? If you just want to ride slowly for fun and dont care about your weight then go ahead and do it.

The  VFS Fahrradmanufaktur I currently use as my main ride is the lowestend from that German manufacturer but it is actually the best bicycle I have ever had in my life and to most casual commuters I meet the  seem way too expensive not to mention the upgrades I installed as the original parts wore out this bicycle is past k kilometers.The weight is usually explained by having to carry other peoples gear weaker people kids or just mission payload photography gear for example... Gear weight is a great way to equalize the various physical abilities in a group  and it provides free extra training ! And when the main bicycle is not heavy enough I commute using my Bakfiets cargobike  just for fun... Maybe I understand the rural USAs love for gasguzzling trucks after all.As for the performance orientation... Ever spiced up your commute by racing against people who use electric bikes ? Of course they are technically advantaged  makes victory even sweeter ! Also budgetary allocation is a factor sometimes you have to decide that youll make do with what you have at hand...

Confirm the wheel spins freely take it back if it doesnt and back off the wheel nuts and retighten them.  Another problem is with the angle of the brake levers.

People do it and think that its ok or they dont even think about it and all the while it prematurely wears down parts damages your components and maybe in this case bends a chainring. The ONLY time it seems to be ok is when a rider is shifting the rear derailleur into a higher speed when the chain is going down the cassette. As for anything else NEVER shift when the drivetrain is under load! Maybe youre a strong rider and maybe the chainring did fail but you might be a shitty shifter maybe. Think of using a manual transmission in a automobile. Simple rundown on how to shift gears there let off the gas depress the clutch shift into new gear and slowly release the clutch. Now use that same concept and apply it to shifting on your bike and stop bragging about how strong your are.,bicycling,cvh3s00,17,t5_2qi0s

Mainly its the added weight on your ass though.Around here they call combination biking and camping cycle touring and the offroad kind bikepacking. There is a lot of literature and blogs on options for both but the general idea is to use pannier bags frame bags or handlebar bags for storage.

5325139,0,t3_3nyfgf,Your bike size should maybe be about cm as far as one can say from body height alone I think so the difference isnt that much though can be noticeable especially on longer rides.Rising the seat could work you should adjust that one anyway. If you can get it high enough would depend on the seat post you can get longer ones as replacement. Going too far may change saddle position which you can adjust too. Though it may move the saddle a bit further backwards which you would want for distance to handle bar but is most likely less good for your position in relation to pedals which would be more important on the long runThe bike could also be too short. You could get a longer stem which could influence handling or try out if lowering has the wanted effect. A lower handle bar is good for aerodynamics but not too comfortable especially for people not used to ride that way.conclusion You can adjust a lot of things either by just moving them within their technical limits or replacing them with largerlonger pedants. But all this only within some limits and most of the time there is some tradeoff in handling.Also it depends what exactly you think is a comfortable ride. A road bike isnt that comfortable to begin with. They are made for speed. So if you dint ride one so far you may get used to it after some time. Though you are most likely right that the wrong frame size has at least some relevant influence here.,bicycling,cvscjs9,0,t5_2qi0s

I think that we should be selling bicyling as not only a sport but a means of transportation and a way to clean up our urban centers.A lot of those people you picked up and drove probably thought I can never afford a bike or I am too nervous to bike or perhaps even I dont know how to ride a bike.

Ultegra rear derailleur  speed  cassette chain  brakes front and back Duraace barend shifters crosstop levers Ritchey seat Felt carbon fork and PDX bird bottle cages.

5578644,0,t1_cwnyt7p,Didnt see this before posting my reply.  Odds are the issue is the derailleur because inside the shifter is just a racheting mechanism that is the same for all clicks beyond the first.  If they get stuck sometimes theyll click into the first position but then wont go any further. Its unusual that theyll go through most clicks but then stop at the last couple.  My bed is that your L limit screw on the derailleur is tightened much too far.The easiest way to test is to disconnect the cable at the rear derailleur.  Using your hand put some tension on the cable and downshift to the smallest cog.  Keeping tension on shift up through the full range and count the clicks.  If you dont get them all then the problem is in the shifter.Fortunately its pretty easy to fix.  Shifters commonly start to stick especially whine a bike hasnt been ridden in a long time.  Take the cable out all the way if you can might need to pay  for a new cable depending on how chewed up the mounting point is.  Look for the screws that hold the shifter housing together.  Theyre small Phillips screws on every Shimano MTB shifter Ive opened and take a  bit.  Make sure you have the right size screwdriver and be careful...theyre easy to strip.  There are usually two or three on top and one or two on the bottom.  Remove them and carefully lift off the housing.  Flood the whole thing with WD or similar and then start shifting up and down and notice which parts of the ratcheting mechanism move.  Use something stiff like a small screwdriver and move them back and forth to loosen them up.  There are usually only one or two parts that get stuck...typically a springloaded catch that gets forced up when you shift doesnt click back into place but working it back and forth once or twice usually loosens it.Keep clicking up and down until it cleanly and quickly clicks through each position.  Its usually pretty obvious when it starts working again.  Flush it well with WD especially if there is a lot of grit in there until its clean and smooth.  Shake out the excess and wipe the drips off the housing and let it dry for an hour or two or if you have a compressor blast the excess out with air.Relube it before putting it back together.  WD evaporates and itll quit working pretty quickly if you use only that.  in oil seems to work OK but Ive found it can stick again if you do a lot of wet riding or mostly store the bike outside.  Something heavier like chainsaw oil is better.  Dump plenty of it in there before the WD completely dries then shake out and wipe off the excess.  Run through all of the gears again a bunch of times and reassemble.From there hook the derailleur back up using the steps I posted earlier.If it does turn out to be the shifter then its worth opening up the other one and doing the same.  When one starts to stick its a nearguarantee than the other one will as well.,bicycling,cwokzns,1,t5_2qi0s
5583709,0,t1_cwp5hug,On tubulars... Not necessarily weaker. Depends if you go for a super supple lightweight one or one with a bit more protection.  The very first time you mount a tire you have to do the several coats of gluing etc..but if changing the tire you just need to mount a preglued tub pump up and go. Only need to clean and reglue every season or so really. You can repair them. Either yourself if you learn how to sew. Or send the off to be repaired  its not obscenely expensive. On the roadside you can either use a sealant like vittoria pittstop caffelatex etc...or you can put a preglued tub under your seat many can fold up pretty small and just stick that on. Wouldnt take much longer than changing a clincher tire. However I agree with you that they are more expensive tend to be just for racing I too train on clinchers and for most people are not worthwhile. But just thought Id highlight some of the misconceptions that theyre incredibly difficult to work with or that if you get a puncture you need a new tire.Edit PS when I made the switch these two threads were invaluable,bicycling,cwp7lmg,6,t5_2qi0s

If you think you can find a counterexample please let me know so that I can test it. Reputable manufacturers not only test their lights to see how many lumens they put out theres even an ANSI standard for it Good light manufacturers will test to and market per the FL Standard. Some companies own an integrating sphere others send their lights to an independent lab for testing. The equipment costs on the order of k so its out of reach for independent reviewers but not unreasonable for a lighting company to own. Ive had the fortunate opportunity to use an integrating sphere at Light amp Motions factory to do lumen testing. I tested  different generic Chinese lights all of them were  or lower than the claimed output and not a single one was over  lm.   Generic  lm light also often sold as  lm actual output  lm  Generic  lm light actual output  lm  Generic  lm light also advertised anywhere from kk lm actual output  lm and lasted lt minutesCheap lights are cheap for a reason and part of that is because they lie.

Best to have someone who knows about bikes to come with you to a craigslist meeting or have them check out the eBay item before biddingbuying.As for models and brands there are a million out there.

5969013,0,t1_cy1x00e,Theres a gulf but its not enormous. For one thing its not illegal to kill us. In spite of being overwhelmingly at fault in collisions only   in  motorists who kill cyclists are ever charged with a crime. Or as the New York Times  puts itgt It is de facto legal to kill people even when it is clearly your fault as long youre driving a car and the victim is on a bike and youre not obviously drunk and dont flee the scene. When two cars crash everybody agrees that one of the two drivers may well be to blame cops consider it their job to gather evidence toward that determination. But when a car hits a bike its like theres a collective cultural impulse to say Oh well accidents happen. If your yearold daughter bikes to school tomorrow inside a freshly painted bike lane and a driver runs a stop sign and kills her and then says to the cop Gee I so totally did not mean to do that that will most likely be good enough. Also the hate. It may not be as bad as slavery or rape or even unequal pay but go to any comments thread in an article where a cyclist was killed there will be people praising the driver and saying they did us all a favor. Or consider the journalist who published a column entitled Whats smug and deserves to be decapitated stating in part A festive custom we could do worse than foster would be stringing piano wire across country lanes to decapitate cyclists. He also said that the lynching of a cyclist by a mob of mothers with pushchairs would be a joy to witness. The article was taken down when dozen of people complained and the journalist apologized and said he was only joking haha who knew those smug bastards would take it so seriously?

We took it to the studio in the trunk of my moms car. I lovingly wrapped the frame up with a blanket and popped the wheels back on at the studio. I think they had a flames projected on the wall behind me. At the time i thought it was awesome. And i guess as you say its still a time capsule of the moment. I was proud of that bike. It was the first one I bought with my own money. I still have it actually. Use it exclusively to haul the kids in their trailer.

6001760,0,t1_cy6cp64,Oh I see! What kind of weather have you been cycling in? Is the drivetrain generally free from muddirt or is it clogged up at all? It looks like your bike has quickrelease wheels which is good as it means youll be able to take it apart and have a look at the cassette on its own. Flick the quick release lever open loosen it by turning it anticlockwise holding the nut on the opposite side to successfully loosen flip your bike upside down and lie it on the saddle and handlebars. Hold the bike by the chain stay and pull the wheel up and out towards you pushing on the rear derailleur to create chain slack and allow the wheel to pop out if necessary. Take the rear wheel and try spinning the cassette anticlockwise. It should turn whilst clicking with relative ease.  It should be fixed when turning clockwise i.e. not move independently of the wheel. Have a go at this and let us know how you get on,bicycling,cy6d0bz,1,t5_2qi0s

My concern is that the perception of needing to wear highvis and run lights all the time to be safe is discouraging to potential new cyclists  it makes cycling seem more dangerous more of a hassle and more expensive to start doing. Wearing of highvis clothes and daytime lights seems to be most common in countries that have the worst attitudes towards cyclists and where cycling is rare. The primary factor of safety in cycling is always numbers and I feel its important that cycling should be promoted as a safe and cheap activity not one where you need to spend  on lights and special clothing or be taking risks with your life. ,bicycling,czyymeg,1,t5_2qi0s

Assuming the clamp diameter is correct and the reach is closeish to what you need and assuming youre trying to dial in a newnew to you bike theyre handy in that regard as you dont need to uninstall everything to experiment with different heights and reach for your cockpit.Outside of that application theyre terrible.The HB clamp design will wear under stress and over enough time will be harder and harder to get the bars gripped properly to keep from slipping. The weight is an issue if you care about weight. But the biggest problem youll run into is the pivotjoint in the middle.Just by biking youll be applying a twisting stress to the entire joint essentially widening the hole the bolt runs through as well as the gaps between the two sections.Youll keep tightening and tightening them to eliminate the play that will develop until the bolt bottoms out or the gaps have worn so badly that you cant tighten it enough or the bolt snaps.,bicycling,d09pgaa,4,t5_2qi0s

6685249,0,t3_477nor,Chains generally last  miles. YMMV so much depends upon riding conditions and how often you cleanlube your chain.  Personally I cleanrelube my chain about once a week  miles or so when riding in cleandry conditions.  Ill do it immediately after any wetgrimy ride.  If you use a quicklink its super easy to just pop off your chain to cleandegrease and thread it back on to relube.Cassettes can outlast your chain if you replace the chain before its too worn If you dont you increase the wear on the cassette cogs.Your chainrings usually last longer than your cassette ... even if youre not great about replacing the chain ... the load is spread over many more teeth.The interesting thing is that a worn chaincassette can work ok together but start skipping if you put on a new chain.  A chainring can go a long time in a worn condition but can accelerate the wear on your chain ... youre more likely to have poor shifting than skipping with worn chainrings. Without photos though all we can do is guess.As for the tires ... they may well be worn and you dont have to get flats for that to be true ... again photos will help.  Shop around online for tires youll almost certainly find good tires cheaper online than at the LBS and you can easily swap them yourself.All of this stuff can be done on your own if you have the least bit of mechanical ability and invest in a few tools.  YouTube has a million videos to help you.Tools for routine jobs  . Allen wrench set the Park Tools way will usually cover most stuff but can be cumbersome in tight spots ... good to have a few loose ones as well ... these are super cheap and can be purchased at any hardware store.. Cassette lockring tool. Chain whip. Chain tool. Adjustable wrench a large and a small one are good to have. Tire levers. An old toothbrush for cleaning your chain.Stuff to keep in stock. Degreaser. Good chain lube. Triflow for lubing brake pivots derailleurs derailleur pulleys cables etc.... Tubes. Patch kit. RagsAll of the stuff thats adding up to over  can be purchased more cheaply elsewhere Im gonna get hammered by the support your LBS crowd and you can totally avoid the labor charges by DIY.Id have them fix up your wheel and do the rest yourself.

6758725,0,t1_d0iarl1,gt Very thorough. Thanks. So more aero  faster? Lighter  not necessarily faster?Lighter  faster as well just not nearly as much as people want to think.To put some numbers on it you are about  kg.  Your bike is  kg of which maybe . is on the wheels.  Total mass   kg.  When accelerating though that rotating weight makes it feel like theres . kg.  If you were to lose  g from the wheels that reduces the total mass to . kg . reduction.  When accelerating it feels like . kg . reduction.End result youll climb hills . faster and accelerate . faster give or take.  So yes youll go faster but not by enough to matter unless youre talking competitionlevel.  BTW Zipp stated once that extra mass on the wheels might actually be a good thing especially for nonprofessional cyclists due to a flywheel effect.Aero  faster as well.  In fact adding a little bit of mass to make a wheel more aerodynamic isnt a bad idea.  First because mass mostly matters when climbing hills ... but if you come back down youll get that energy back out.  Not all of it mind you because the faster you go the more you lose to air resistance.  So adding a bit of weight that makes you aerodynamic balances out in the end as long as you dont get dropped on the climb.  And second because that extra mass when talking about wheels is closer to the hubs so doesnt impact the moment of inertia as much as would be thought.gt What are your thoughts on Flo wheels?I havent formed an opinion sorry.gt Looks like the aero options are just as heavy as my current set so im not sure if that would be a lateral move. See above.  Its probably a step up.  Whether its enough to justify the extra cost is up to you.gt FWIW im  and generally anywhere between lbs so ive read that means I need to go with a higher spoke count as well. Borderline.  Ive recently lost weight down to  but I used to be right in that same range.  I also rode on very similar wheels to what you have R IIRC.  I did end up with a tiny crack in the rear rim so theres a data point for you.  Thats not to say I think you need to replace your wheels right now  ride them and if you start to break spokes or crack the rim then I would look into replacing the wheel.But if youre getting new wheels anyway a few extra spokes would be nice.  I dont think you need to go with a spoke rear wheel or anything like that.   would be the absolute minimum for a rear wheel IMO  would be better.  The number of spokes reduces aerodynamics a bit and increases mass very slightly but really doesnt matter after that.,bicycling,d0ieq1o,2,t5_2qi0s

The defy one also has slightly nicer wheels and a carbon fork the defy may have a carbon fork too these days. I did a cross country trip with a large group this summer. We had a giant sponsorship so were literally all riding Giant Defy  or  with a few carbon models among us. No one who had the  groupset ever had any issues with their shifting. Meanwhile the people with Tiagra and especially Sora had loads of problems. That is anecdotal evidence but we were a group of  so it is not a tiny sample size. Ive put  miles on my  groupset over the past year and have had minimal problems. I have barelly even had to reindex or mess with the barrel adjusters. It is very much made to be used often.

6918737,0,t3_4ai8zn,I think helmet use is a good idea and I believe most people should be wearing one ... especially in countries like the US where our infrastructure is still very carcentric.  That said I dont think helmet use for adults should be compulsory.  I can understand that some people casual riders especially think that a helmet is overkill and if you dont want to wear one thats your decision and I support your right to make it.I dont support safety laws where the only person at risk is the one thats taking the risk.  I believe there should be public education about the benefitsrisks of helmet used but thats the extent of it.  I do support seatbelt laws however as there is a public safety component to seatbelt use.  Not only do seatbelts protect occupants from impact forces they also keep people in their seats where they belong.  This increases a drivers ability to remain in control of the vehicle during extreme maneuvers.  Similarly I do not support mandatory helmet use for motorcyclists either.  If you want to smear your grey matter across I thats your deal.  Id wear one myself but would support your right to not wear one even if I questioned the wisdom of that decision.I do support mandatory helmet use in juveniles though.

6954374,1,t1_d14lfkw,Depends what you mean as better and how you expect it to react.The purpose of a helmet is to stop concussion if you have even a slight concussionhead ache then the helmet hasnt done its job. It may well have prevented you from a more serious injury but it didnt do its primary task.Helmets are only tested to specific requirements so we can only say they do this. They may be better but we have no way of knowing.Ive crashed at mph and I had no apparent head injuries apart from a slight concussion.Edit The following is a link as to what a helmet is designed for. In a roundabout way what they say regarding deceleration is talking about preventing the brain from hitting the skull due to a large impact and preventing concussion a second benefit from this is the foam reducing the applied impact force to the skull should reduce the chances of fracturing the skull but the forces required to do that on a flat surface are huge and normally not attained without external forces which loops back to my initial comment about using them outside of their designed paramaters.. ,bicycling,d14m0kc,0,t5_2qi0s

As your fitness improves amp weight goes down youll also burn less calories than when you first started.Just prepare by slowly increase your distance.

You need to be aware of your own vulnerability when riding on the roads.The type of vehicle doesnt really matter at least when it comes to passenger vehicles.  SUV sedan compact truck whatever.  But the road youre on does make a difference.  Its a lot easier to share some roads than others.I highly recommend perusing the Strava Heat Map to see what roads cyclists like to ride.  Those are roads that you can generally consider to be safe.  Drivers are used to seeing bikes on those roads and will know how to share them.  Theyre roads that hundreds or thousands of cyclists have ridden daily because theyre safer  wider shoulders or a bike lane easier visibility for cars slower vehicle speeds less traffic etc.,bicycling,d1que9q,1,t5_2qi0s

7151093,0,t1_d1qzar9,gt Is there any damage to be done riding with this setup?An speed shifter pulls . mm of cable with each click.  The derailleur moves . mm for each mm of cable so each click is . mm the distance between sprockets on an speed cassette.But a speed cassette has the sprockets spaced at . mm.  The gears are packed in tighter basically.  So each shift moves a bit too far.  You might be able to get part of the cassette to work OK ... but there will be a point when the derailleur tries to put the chain halfway between two gears.  Yuck.So its not really about damage though I would expect the cassette and chain to wear out faster its about the system simply not working at all.There might be a configuration of the Jtek ShiftMate that would get the system to work though.  Youd only be able to use  of the  gears of course.,bicycling,d1r0a0a,4,t5_2qi0s

7172810,0,t3_4dqxta,Just an FYI for easier communication the gear changer is a derailleur. Essentially it is a spring attached to a cable and your shifter pulls and releases that cable in specific amounts to make the spring compress or release and move between gears.Your issue There can be a number of things that cause this if he wrecked the bike it could have caused the derailleur to bend thats the worst case scenario because then said derailleur probably needs replaced. More than likely it is an issue with the tension on the cable that actually moves the derailleur. The easiest possible fix for this is using the adjustment screws you can find YouTube videos how to adjust front derailleur if you want to tackle it yourself or get it handled at a bike shop pretty cheap. The other possibility is that the cable has stretched over time and needs replaced its a cheap part but the installation is a little more involved.,bicycling,d1thbsq,5,t5_2qi0s

You can try it out to make sure its the right size too which is especially important for road bikes.If thats not possible used isnt for everybody then I usually suggest going to Bikes Direct.  This bike is the same price.  You get quite a bit more for your money a carbon fiber fork instead of steel which will save significant weight while still being comfortable and the drivetrain components are upgraded to full Claris aka  instead of a mix of A.   and  are the same overall level of components but  is the most recent release  the shifters are especially improved.  A is a level down from both and chosen just to save money.The bike you linked isnt really a bad bike though.  Its basically the absolute minimum level I would recommend for anybody.

I agree that the accident was avoidable and that the girl should not walk away unpunished for the tragic mistake she has made but instead of complaining about murder and demanding a potentionally liferuining prison sentence for the girl you should be complaining about the lacking cycling infrastructure! Thats the real scandal here if there is one. A five feet shoulder lane would have prevented that accident and instead of making it all about another spoiled sorority brat murdered a cyclist to feed your outrage the title of the thread should be about another tragic accidents as a result of an insufficient infrastructure.

7365385,0,t3_4g8hog,Went to my local Specialized Elite Retailer down the street from me and the only Allez Sport they had in  was White. Wasnt really having it so I asked if they could order the black for me. Turns out Specialized is no longer making them until they start rolling out the s which they said would be about August.Went home defeated and pulled up their website and started calling all the places within a  mile radius. They said the only way I would get a  in Black is if I called a shop and got lucky that they havent sold it yet. Fifth place I called was like Yep we have it! I think I asked the poor lady like four times to double check that it was what I asked for because I didnt want to drive two hours for her to get it wrong.But! I got there and there she was. They did some computerized fitment for me let me take her down the road and all was well. Took the front wheel off loaded her in my trunk and headed home.Shout out to the irc channel for putting up with my shit for the last three days while I went through the buying process and answering all my questions. I truly bought the bike on a whim primarily to get back into fitness and exercise more. I hate running and never had an issue with biking so I thought Id look into it a bit more ask questions and here I am. I originally intended on getting a Defy  or Escape  but all the discussion in chat and a youtube video ended up leading me towards this Allez Sport.Since the picture Ive added a bottle cage and turned back is that the right word? the handlebars so theyre not angled towards the floor anymore. Theyre more parallel with the ground now. Also have a Lezyne Pressure Drive CFH Timbuk saddlebag Podium Chill water bottle Conti tube WOTOW repair tool w tire levers and a patch kit ordered and on their way. Only issue I have left is the seat. The seat hurts my ass so much. I know its probably a Ill get used to it kind of thing but damn does it hurt. I bought bike shorts as well but I think I need to return them for a size smaller since they were kind of loose on me. Im assuming theyre not supposed to be loose at all.Lastly I took her out yesterday on the path right near my house. It was a really short ride just under two miles in about eight minutes because I was already exhausted from the drive picking the bike up and because UFC was starting... Got my first battle wound which was while I was changing gears my right foot slipped and the pedal bit the back of my ankle. Drew a little blood and a nice bruise. And then I swallowed a bug.

If you are new to cycling or have really increased you mileage then this loss could be slower because you will also be gaining a little muscle yay!.Everybodys daily requirements are a bit different and website calculators cant account for individual physiology so it may require a little fine tuning.Also weight fluctuates a lot from day to day just in water weight.

7883469,0,t1_d41puvr,Since you said youre looking at the DS series Im going to assume you meant the . and . so Im going to talk about those to bikes because Trek also makes a FX . and . which are more suited for road use.I currently own the DS . and I freaking love it.  I bought it  month ago and I have  miles on it between NYC roads gravel trails offroads and its perfect for that.The DS . is a great entry bike  dont get me wrong.  I was fortunate enough to have a little extra money to spend so I went with the . for the following reasons Disc brakes.  This was the main selling point.  The stopping power of disc brakes in urban conditions were a musthave for me. Lockout front suspension.   The . has the same suspension as the . minus the ability to lock it.  I like Im able to reach down and lock my suspension with a flick of my fingers heh when Im trucking up a hill or Im on a nice road and dont need the suspension. Color.  I know this is silly but I loved the blackblue color scheme of the .gt How fare will I be able to travel with the DS vs a more rugged bike?As far as your legs will take you!    Seriously though the cc wheels are perfect for me.  I really enjoy the slightly wider tire size but not at wide as a mountain bike.My recommendation?

8277727,0,t1_d5bp4ud,Ahhh the classic regret of buying a hybrid.Is it possible to put drop handlebars on a hybrid?  Yes.  Its been done before and theres examples of it being done in this sub.However its not exactly straightforward and not necessarily worth it.  You need more than just the handlebars you also need new shifters to match and those shifter have to be compatible with the derailleurs or youll be replacing those as well.  Add in new shift and brake cables bar tape and a new stem and youre set.The end result is something pretty close to a gravel or cyclocross bike.  You might need new tires to complete the transition.  The bike geometry is a bit off so your position on the bike isnt right.  Some people think its fine others say that its weird to ride.So its a lot of work and the end results could be questionable.  Most people here recommend against it unless youre very handy with bike components and enjoy a challenge.  Otherwise save up your money and get the right bike later.,bicycling,d5c9w25,1,t5_2qi0s

8329670,0,t3_4tntk9,Hey guysI just got back from vacation in Hawaii and thought you might be interested in reading about my experience climbing the longest paved climb in the world. Its by far the dumbest thing Ive done in a while. The mountain is called Haleakala and its actually a volcano that comprises about  of the island of Maui its the entire eastern portion of the island. The climb starts in a little town on the northern coast of Maui called Paia is  miles long and climbs ft from sea level to the summit. The average grade is  and although there are a few steep ramps along the way the gradient is fairly even across the distance of the climb. If you measure it from where it begins to rise from the sea floor Haleakala is actually taller than Mt Everest as around  feet of it is below the water level. There are three factors in my opinion at least that make it a challenging climb. The sheer length of it. Going uphill for  straight miles with no real areas of rest is taxing. The longest continuous climb Id done prior to this was Mt. Ventoux a couple years ago which is  ft but when it comes to planning for a ride that goes twice as high I was at something of a loss. The absolute fastest times up Haleakala are in the  range so its a whole different beast to anything Ive experienced. Its also fairly impossible to bring enough to drink along the way. Fortunately theres a little market in Kula at around ft where you can get water and snacks and a park station at ft for you to refill again. Food is less of an issue to carry but when your starting temperature is close to  degrees youll go through a lot of water.. The elevation gain becomes noticeable at around  feet. The air feels thinner youre already tired from climbing for  miles and youve still got ft the elevation gain of Alpe dHuez to go. With every pedal stroke youre getting less oxygen and by the time I got to ft or so I started to really feel the effects. It becomes very easy to get out of breath and if you push too hard youll find yourself becoming lightheaded quickly. Youll also see a drop off in your power as a result of the air composition which is on top of the power youve lost due to the distance youve already climbed.. The weather. When I started in Paia it was hot around  degrees. When I finished at the summit it was  degrees windy foggy and wet. I brought along a really great vest and arm warmers castelli fawesome vest and nanoflex arm warmers which were plenty to get me to the summit but not quite enough to keep me warm on the first half of the descent. Still thats about as much space in my pockets as I wanted to devote to extra gear. The rest of the space I needed for food. Doing it again Id bring a second set of fullfingered gloves and maybe a rain jacket. The temperature change on its own wasnt too bad but the wind was pretty brutal. I found myself riding into a pretty strong headcrossheadwind the entire way up which really saps the energy out of your legs. Because of the way the weather cycles on the island the trade winds blow clouds onto the mountain every day around midmorning so my understanding is that these weather conditions are normal. The viewUnfortunately its not the most beautiful climb Ive done compared to climbs like Alpe dHuez Col du Galibier and Mt. Ventoux even if it might be the hardest. The way the road is laid out there are only two real areas of switchbacks so you dont get that breathtaking standingatthetopofaclifflike view that you do on a lot of the european climbs. On a clear day the view from the top is really beautiful you can see the whole island but a clear day at the summit is hard to come by unless you start before sunrise. I entered the cloud level at around ft and didnt get much of a view the rest of the way up. Still the mountain itself is interesting and riding through fog does contribute to the sense of otherworldliness that you start to feel higher up the mountain. Similar to Ventoux at a little past halfway up around ft or so the landscape changes drastically to something that feels very alien. For the first  of the climb youre going through meadows farms and forests but once you cross the toll station into the state park youre greeted with a much more sparse distinctly volcanic landscape. If Ventoux is lunar in appearance Haleakala looks a lot like Mars at times due to the reddish color of the soil and rocks.The DescentNow if the climb suffers at all on the way up for its lack of hairpins it makes up for it on the way down. It was easily the most fun Ive ever had going downhill on a road bike. With the exception of the two sections of switchbacks and even they are quite sweeping in nature the descent has a great flow to it. You can carry speed through most of the curves and youre rarely ever hard on the brakes. Getting back down took me a little over an hour not really pushing at all just enjoying the experience. If you dont want to deal with all the climbing there are actually a ton of tour companies that take tourists up to the top so that they can ride the descent. Not all of them go past the toll and theyre mostly on mountain bikes or more cruisertype setups but Id imagine even that would be really enjoyable. On a road bike its perfect. The surface is really good and you can maintain a good rate of speed with little to no effort due to the consistency of the gradient.Overall Assessment and the photosIt was a long day. I finished the climb with an average speed of .mph in . If I had a chance to do it again with less wind and better pacing I think I could do better but for the day and for the first time Ive experienced that kind of oxygen deprivation Im pretty happy with how it went. The first couple photos in the album are the view I had from the top on the day I climbed it by bike. As you can see very limited visibility due to the intense fog. Later in the album are a few shots I took when I went back a couple days later to do some hiking earlier in the morning when it was clear at the summit. If you do find yourself going to Maui do Haleakala twice. Once on a bike and once in a car. There are some really good hiking trails at the summit with much better views than youre afforded from the road.

8447407,0,t3_4va4gd,the tires most likely have nothing to do with it so just get that over with. tubes are what hold the air and they are the only thing that does that unless you are riding on tubulars which you arent and shouldnt be. the tires keep the pressure and do all the other stuff like touching the ground and absorbing impact and getting hot and cold and flexing and stiffening and having glass and shit poke through them or whatever else. but you said there was no debris and the sidewall was compromised. so...sometimes when people install a tube and tire onto a wheel there is some pinching that goes on that doesnt really make itself apparent until you have riding pressure and terrain involved. i always inflate my stuff to around psibar and then go around the wheel and wiggle the tire back and forth to make sure the bead is seated properly and straighten out any wierdness that might be in there.also like someone said a repair kit and pump is essential. you dont have to get the best pump just something that is built for a road bike and works with the type of valve stem you have. mountain bikes run lower pressure and the pumps made specifically for them are made to pump up to that instead of the psi of a road tire. ive never felt like the co cannister pumps were for me but they make it easy? dont forget to wait like  minutes for the rubber cement to dry before you put the patch on the tube thats important. ,bicycling,d5xgomp,1,t5_2qi0s

I would say that these two bikes may be a step up from where most people start but they would definitely be good bikes Im not too familiar with Avanti since Im in the US but Ive seen good things about them online. Most riders start with an aluminum frame carbon fork combo.  You mentioned that you want to have the bike for the next several years so starting with a carbon frame may not be a bad idea.  . k is a decent price for what you would be getting yes.. For a new rider buying online can be a big success or a big hassle.  If youre not too familiar with working on a bike Id suggest sticking with a shop.. Id say if purchasing a bike with  is in your budget go for it.  You wouldnt be disappointed with Sora or Tiagra but the  is a workhorse at least in my experience.. Other parts of the bike that are upgraded when jumping from one level bike to the next are carbon layup wheels seatpost etc.  In your case youre not looking at entry level bikes so I would stick with your current choices as youre getting good value for your first bike. . Ive been told the same thing and I wish I had been told that before I purchased my first road bike so I would tend to say that at least to me it is indeed good advice.  Ive mentioned this earlier but I personally feel as though the bikes youre looking at are a great place to start and if it is indeed in your budget I would go for one.

Drink early and often dehydration definitely saps your energy and feelings of wellbeing.For me the last  miles are always the toughest.  This is where mental fortitude kicks in.  You can do this just keep pushing the pedals down.  Be careful about pacing in the first half.  Warm up slowly for the first  miles or so.

An Italian Basso bike was the only one I liked more than my fiveyearold Kona Jake a cyclocross bike with the road chainwheels swapped for a smaller MTB set. Something about the ride and the view of the front forks put a smile on my face.My Kona Jake came with Shimano Tiagra drive parts including STI gear shifters.

Arts Cyclery has some really good youtube videos about it. these are some good general fit rules straddling the bike with your feet flat on the ground the top tube should be about an inch below your crotch the saddle should be high enough that your legs come close about  degrees to fully extending and low enough that your hips dont rock when you pedal the saddle should be far enough forward that with the pedals parallel to the ground a string held at the front of your knee cap goes straight down to the pedal spindle with your elbows slightly bend and your hands on the hoods you should not be able to see the front hub. if you see it behind the handle bars you need a shorter stem if you see it in front of your handle bars you need a longer stem.hope that wasnt confusing!,bicycling,d71eiyh,2,t5_2qi0s

8908864,0,t1_d7iojvo,Wheel building is a difficult task even for exprienced home mechanics.  Sure its relatively straight forward but without tools such as a truing stand it can be extremely difficult to nail down. Likewise for cabling and setting the right tension.  Easy enough with the right tools and experience but a frustrating time without those.  Even to a basic fine tuning can be difficult without a decent knowledge.  A basic wheelbuild from scratch will add up and a machine built wheel will need to be trued quickly. Sure theres something to be said about the experience of building up a bike but it does cost a fair bit to order everything piece by piece.  The OP would be lucky to get away with a straggler build at  with decent parts.  Having a decent LBS does come in useful for repairs and advice as well.

I never bonk on a bicycle though I hear there are people who do.

9033280,0,t3_53zu7d,A singlespeed and especially fixed gear isnt traditionally associated with high speeds.Yes they can achieve high speeds in the velodrome but they run really tall gears and need a long time to get up to speed and sometimes a little push to get going from standstill.  Youd hate riding around town with a gearing that would allow you to attain high speeds too.  Your limitations will be how much grunt you have to get going on the low end ... and how fast and how long you can spin at the high end.  Single speed gear ratios are typically chosen to give you a decent cruising speed at a cadence you can be comfortable with or chosen to maximize performance on one end of the speed range or the other with sacrifices made at other speeds.  ...and if fixedgear theres no getting into a tuck on a descent and letting gravity take your to mph ... unless youre suicidal and take your feet off the pedals.Your best bet is a road bike of some description.  If aeros the way you want to go then so be it but dont do the tribars thing just get traditional drops.EDIT  I know someones going to come in and post how theyre able to average mph on their fixed gear and beat everyone from a standstill.

Stuff that you wouldnt notice on a  mile ride or that would slightly bother you on a  mile ride will ruin your day. For me  miles was where things got weird and the last  of my  were unpleasant.The other part is pacing. I kept a very even and consistent pace that was a mile or two per hour slower than normal.

Higher end stuff will be lighter which helps with speed and hills a bit.  But light weight lower drag etc thats a one time upgrade whereas you continuously can improve yourself.  If you can only afford Sora or whatever either get it or save up for something better.  But then theres always something better that out of reach.  If saving for  means more than a few months then maybe just buy the Sora and enjoy the bike.  It will still last you a damn long time.  I know people who ride the shit out of their Sora .  One of my friends is a fatso yet I will never ever catch him.  Ok hes not huge but he definitely has a bit of a belly and a few extra pounds.  He can put the hurt on me if he wants and rides the fuck out of his Sora bits.  Probably rides like   to   miles a year on it for the past few years.  Another friend who isnt as fast still manages to do at least one ride  miles or longer each weekend.  Sometimes back to back double metrics on Saturday and Sunday.

9094601,0,t3_54u4g7,Well brand doesnt matter so much with bikes theyre all made under contract by big factories in China its more the choice of components etc. The main thing to know with Diamond Back is theyre a discount brand that deals mainly with department stores mail order and corporate discount schemes and their bikes have artificially high MSRP theyre always sold at  or  off. is a good budget to spend for your first bike.My thoughts are. You can afford to get a bike from a proper bike shop that only sells bikes so go to one rather than Dicks or another sportsdepartment store to get a better quality of service. Some brands bikes are better value at MSRP than Diamond Back and you may be able to get a better discount on a  model bike.. My main concern with this bike is the disc brakes. The specifications says theyre alloy linear brakes which is incorrect linear is Vbrakes. Disc brakes on bikes at this sort of price or less are usually mechanical rather than hydraulic using a cable like rim brakes  this bike is like that too. Cheap mechanical disc brakes are often very poor in performance and can be maintenance nightmares the opposite of what youd hope by going with discs. Generally I would recommend going with rim brakes on bikes at this price  if you want discs youre best finding a bit more to get a bike with hydraulics.My pick for  for someone in the US would probably be the Jamis Coda Sport,bicycling,d850x0p,1,t5_2qi0s

9110809,0,t3_552ev0,I think you made a good decision.  It allows you to try the sport out and start getting in shape.  One thing I do is save  per mile I ride.  I just move it over to a savings account at the end of every week and I put that towards my next bike.  If you do something similar you could save  more when the weather is nice and you have time off per week and eventually have some money put aside to upgrade.  The additional bonus is you may get to learn some bike maintenance.  Id spend some time going through all the bolts and connection points to make sure everything is tight and put together correctly.Enjoy the road!

A load that is above the rear wheel would apply forces that carbon layups just arent engineered for. That being said I havent tried it I just know from experience that rackmounted loads on lighter tubesets tend to flex quite a bit especially when pedaling out of the saddle.I think for bikepacking carbon frames probably do fine though.And yeah I mentioned that the fatigue limits of aluminum are something that you dont really have to worry about short term although I have had aluminum frames that develop growing cracks in the headset and bottom bracket.,bicycling,d9h60rc,2,t5_2qi0s

If anything itll only worsen the situation for that individual. Addiction is a terrible way of life and is a punishment in itself for the person going through it. Sure many will never recover but if you give people a nd chance many of them will take it and truly surprise you.

If they didnt break theyre probably just fine and if theyre not you can replace them when they break.Its also a pretty major task to totally respoke a wheel so it needs major benefits to justify. Id approach it like replacing a rim which means Id replace one spoke at a time to make sure I maintain the spoking pattern.After that its just a matter of dishing and truing the wheel while raising tension all around.

9792931,0,t3_5fexqh,Alright so I have a few questions mostly about gear replacement for a new bike of mine aesthetic mostly painting it and getting some new pedals on it. My bike is a Fuji Track  brand new but I can tell Ill really like biking and its a fixed gear. My daily ride would be mostly flat but I would love to go biking on the weekends on hilly areas. So I begin.Firstly the pedals. Are the crank brothers doubleshots good? They look longer than some of their others and theyre clip pedals so I mean Im curious but amazon yields few results.Can I pretty much get whatever cycling shoes? Im looking at EU size . since Im .ft US to FT US in yellow of these Anyone know if these are any good? Any reccomendations on yellow shoes? Id like bright reflective ones for nighttime riding.Id like to paint my bike blueyellow as well will spray painting it and clear coating it be good enough? I can always strip it down to the metal but since it has ED I didnt know if that would reduce durability. Has anyone done this? My dad does have a paint sprayer I think so if need be I can even use that.Lastly is this crankset and chain combo I have chosen any good? Reviews say they are but does anyone here have personal experience?Any and all help is appreciated thanks rbicycling!

Once in a while you may have to slow down or even stop to make a traffic check before shifting position laterally. My impression of this rider is that he rides very fast and doesnt ever want to slow down for that. For example he seemed annoyed when that red car turned onto his road.

Some people consider the entire of Reddit to be their friend though so the code has probably spread a bit farther than intended.  I suspect Raleigh doesnt mind too much but I suspect the bike shops that sell their bikes are a bit disappointed.gt Can I buy the bike and have my LBS assemble and fit me to the bike?Sure but expect to pay a bit extra.  If that shop sells Raleigh they might be a bit miffed that you didnt buy direct from them.However when you buy direct from Raleigh theres an addon a checkout to have someone assemble the bike for you after its delivered and do the minor adjustments to make it fit right and show you how to use the bike.  I think this might even be free on certain bikes.  It might only be available in certain delivery areas though.gt I feel like the price is too good to be true that I must be missing something...Yeah I know what you mean.  Its a very very good price.  But remember youre essentially buying direct from the manufacturer at the employee discount price and Raleigh is a more budgetminded brand to begin with.  Id expect to see a very good price.The caveat is that you dont have a bike shop to support you.  That includes assembly and fitting like you already mentioned.

The same argument is used by delivery trucks that theres nowhere else to go if theyre going to make that delivery.However I think its important that consideration be made for these situations.  Delivery trucks need a way to make their deliveries. Bikes need a place to lock up.  Pedestrians need a place to walk.  Everyone needs a place to safely get to where theyre going.

And Im not comparing this to modern carbon bike Im comparing it to other bikes of its time. That being said face and chase the bottom bracket and headset tubes on the frame. I wont get into details as to why but know youll avoid so many common problems in the future and make the bike last a lot longer. If the frame is rusted out from the inside this probably isnt worth doing.Wheels just buy some cheap alexsisi think thats what theyre called full set of wheels. The important thing is making sure you have sealed bearing hubs on the wheels. They may be a little heavy but theyre durable and well built and you dont need anything more. Bottom bracket I think those cranks are on a spindle so just a get a shimano sealed bearing bottom bracket that fits your cranks theyre cheap and when put into a faced and chased bottom bracket tube it will late forever. Dont let a bike shop sell you a bottom bracket there are lots of different types and then tell you that you need to change youre full crank set and chain rings to make it work its bullshit. Ive seen this before its ridiculous.Headset theres a company I think ita called cain creek or something like thatsomeone confirm. Anyway they make good threaded headsets again on a faced a chased headset tube youll be laughing.Stock up on chain oil and and keep your vhain as clean as possible.

Also the wind into AC can be a pain  StillYou have plenty of time to prepareHere is a tip Your maximum range will be about  times what you are comfortable riding. So see if you can get yourself up to riding  miles on a normal outing by May you will perhaps be a bit sore but wil have no trouble. I promise. Start small.  You dont need to be riding  miles all the time.  Start as low as  miles and then add.  Try to a couple of  mile rides if for no other reasons to learn how to be comfortable for long periods. Be sure to stretch change position etc as you ride.In the winter iIf the weather is bad consider taking spin classes at the local gym. As you ride focus on your cadence. You want to learn to ride with low resistance at a high cadence.  I try to average  strokes per minutes when warmed up and cruising flats. That will make you more efficient. You should not feel like you are climbing all the time. When going up a hill dont be a hero Get into a low gear and spin away.   Maybe watch some of youtube videos on pedalling techniques.You want to be sure your bike fits and you have the proper saddle and clothes for the ride. If you are riding a hybrid or mountain bike it will be harder so buy some smooth vs nobby tires.Learn how to handle your bike so you can eat and grab a drink without stopping. The key is to stay hydrated. eat before hungrydrink before thirstyRemember you will be riding for charity and it isnt a race.

I would sort of understand if you felt that the price premium wasnt worth it for what you see as a negligible quality improvement.

Dry lube can be a whole lot of different things  usually a lighter oilsolvent that has a dry component such as teflon. The idea with dry stuff is that the solvent evaporates and leaves behind the teflon   your chain is lubricated but a whole lot less sticky so dirt doesnt accumulate as fast. The main drawback is that it washes off relatively easily in the rain .. which is a problem where I live. Dry lube is excellent in dry dusty places and can go a long way towards reducing wear created by the dirtoil paste that ends up on moving parts.I guess greasing pedal threads with drylube would be better than nothing but ..

10611928,0,t1_ddaguqc,Ive tangentially involved in this field over the years.Theres a couple things going on that the article doesnt explain very well. First there are two problems  detecting things and  predicting where they will go so the vehicle can be sure to avoid them. Second there is a goal to move from prototype vehicles with expensive sensor suites k lidar systems multiple high resolutionhigh speed cameras millimeter wave radars etc to something that could be commercialized at a reasonable cost. is more or less a solved problem between ladar and shortwave radar and has been for a few years. The effort now is to make that all cheaper and avoid having to put giant spinning things on the roof. is harder and what is really the subject of the article. You can see an obstacle but what is it doing? Is it a pedestrian that will cross the road or it a bicycle moving down the road? A bicycle doesnt look that much different than a pedestrian to a lidar so you need to combine the lidar data with video and try to classify the object. That stuff is hard and will get harder as they try to downcost the sensors.For  you could say oh the car should just avoid no matter what but thats not really practical in an environment with a lot of stuff going on you dont want the car getting stuck in situations where human drivers would have no trouble figuring out what to do.Anyway this stuff will get figured out it will just take time and research.

10666619,0,t3_5sij9j,I feel like a lot of people on here are suggesting you get toe clip and strap pedals which are easy and cheap to install. Though if you are just looking for strap those are made as well. I have only ever had power grip pedals which are a pedal and strap system that run for about  bucks. But I know companies make just straps for pedals as well.  The up side to straps are they can be  but easier to get in and out of and from my own experience but this might vary hold up better over time. The down side is they are not the most efficient for power transfer so toe clip and strap win there.  Depending on what you are looking to do both are good options. If you are mostly a commuter and want a versatile pedal that will work with a lot of shoes straps are probably your best bet. If you are looking to improve your cycling experience toe clip and straps are probably for you.

I actually have a mm knard on it with a mm Continential snow tire but Im in MinnesotaI will get a DiamondBack Trail Carbon tommorow with mm Schwalbe GOne tires and Ill be building up a second wheelset with mm Compass Snowqualmie Pass tires done tubeless.Big tires are great.  With the pressure spread out on a tire that will flex you will never get puncture flats and you have a ton more range with pressures that wont give you a pinch flat.  Because of the way they vibrate they feel slower but theyre not actually slower.  Its just that they dont have the high frequency vibration that only tires you out more and makes you uncomfortable.

Many beginners make that mistake when it comes to proper saddle position.While you can cut the seatpost thats only a bandaid for the larger issue which is the size of the bike overall.

11000782,0,t3_5wz76d,Its certainly a deal breaker for me. Everybody has different experiences but the one bike in the family stable that had discs and quick releases is a nightmare to stop rubbing. If the wheel gets removed it always takes at a minimum several minutes of fiddling with the brake caliper and QR tension and sometimes messing with the caliper. My MTB with thruaxles is a hassle the first time you set it up but then it always stays aligned.In fairness I think a big culprit behind the problem is the aluminum fork it springs itself apart so that the QR has to be under much more tension than normal with the QR removed the front dropouts spread to at least mm you need to fully unscrew the acorn nut to remove the wheel because the skewer isnt long enough to fit around the lawyer lips without compressing the fork legs since the rear is much less of a hassle.Still I think thats where the industry is going and that wheelset availability will be better in the future. In midrange to highend bikes ThruAxles seem prevalent but its still a hassle to find them on cheaper bikes. Every  bike has them but very few  bikes do.Ive got a Raleigh mountain bike and they are one of the few companies that really embraced TA my inexpensive entry level er hardtail has them and was the only bike under k I found that did. ,bicycling,deewmqn,2,t5_2qi0s

11340349,0,t3_61s8ew,Youre possibly damaging the chain by degreasing it so often. edit In another post you say you spend an hour each time doing this? Chains need lube in them. Dont remove it. Maybe consider waxing the chain.Do what KMC say  wipe it down with an old rag after each ride. Wash it if its particularly gritty or muddy. Lube it when necessary. No chain cleaners degreasers rituals are necessary according to them  and they specifically warn against chain cleaners.Ive had a chain last km without showing . wear  not sure what it is now because Ive had that bike on my trainer for a while and Ive not checked it. But I see no need to fret about the wear meaning Id need to replace the cassette at this point.My current bikes done about k since new. Not changed the chain yet. I have more or less as a test degreased this chain to see how it compares with te just wiped it with a rag km one. But degreasing consists of a quick squirt with degreaser with the rear wheel off and a chain saver in place instead and rinse with a hosepipe  a few minutes not an hourThe only thing I spend a lot of time on when cleaning the bike is drying it Im thinking of getting a cheap air compressor to do this especially during the months when the bike doesnt dry quickly in the sun.A lot of factors will affect it  weather other conditions etc. My LBS seemed to think my high cadence riding style was chainfriendly not sure if thats true or not.

11385515,0,t3_62f4os,In case anyone else is having trouble accessing the linkKALAMAZOO MI  The driver of a pickup truck that struck  bicyclists in Cooper Township in June  will stand trial for seconddegree murder.Kalamazoo County Circuit Court Judge Paul J. Bridenstine has denied a motion from Charles Pickett Jr.s defense attorneys Alan Koenig and Keith Turpel.The attorneys had argued that the prosecution failed to provide probable cause to bind Pickett over to circuit court on the seconddegree murder charges and that the district court abused its discretion when it did so following a preliminary examination on the evidence.Pickett is accused of driving drugged and plowing into a group of bicyclists killing five on June  . He faces five counts of operating while intoxicated causing death five counts of seconddegree murder and four counts of operating while intoxicated causing serious injury.He could face up to life in prison if convicted of seconddegree murder.In a written opinion filed March  Bridenstine denied Koenigs motion to quash Picketts bindover to circuit court on the seconddegree murder charges. He also denied a motion from Picketts attorneys to suppress Picketts statements to police at Borgess Medical Center following the crash. Koenig alleged Pickett was questioned by Kalamazoo County Sheriffs detectives after twice invoking his constitutional right to have a lawyer present.Det. Sgt. Richard Mattison of the Kalamazoo County Sheriffs Office said at a motion hearing March  that Pickett twice asked for a lawyer when Mattison and another detective went to interview him June  at Borgess. Mattison said he stopped the interview. Then Det. Sgt. Donald McGehee asked Pickett if he knew why he was in the hospital and Pickett indicated he was in a wreck and was told somebody died. Mattison testified McGehee told Pickett he killed five people.Mr. Pickett seemed to get really wideeyed and stared at Det. McGehee and his mouth fell open Mattison said noting Pickett seemed shocked.Then he asked What did I do hit a family or something?Mattison said he couldnt discuss it with Pickett because Pickett had asked for an attorney.He made some comments about its already happened it cant be changed I might as well talk to you Mattison testified Thursday. He said he asked Pickett twice whether he wanted to go forward with an interview to which Pickett responded he did. Mattison then questioned Pickett.Koenig argued the interview with Pickett at the hospital violated his clients constitutional rights and at minimum the detective should have read Pickett his Miranda rights a second time.Bridenstine denied Koenigs motion saying Pickett didnt appear to misunderstand what was happening or complain about any physical or mental condition.It is the position of this court that after initially invoking his right to an attorney before police questioning there is a preponderance of evidence that the defendant voluntarily knowingly and intelligently waived that right Bridenstine said in a written opinion. The court finds that defendants decision was not triggered by any express or implied pressure from the government to do so.A trial is scheduled next month with jury selection to start April  and the trial to start April . However Koenig on March  filed a notice of intention to use the insanity defense and Pickett was ordered to undergo an evaluation for criminal responsibility at the states Center for Forensic Psychiatry in Ypsilanti. That evaluation could cause the trial to be postponed.Koenig could not immediately be reached for comment.,bicycling,dfmj1pp,88,t5_2qi0s

11425824,0,t3_633u18,And now we read aloud from the book of Saint Sheldon chapter  verses  gt A cyclist who is out of cycling shape from being off a bicycle for a few months or more will start out strong but the legs will tire rapidly. When the legs tire the rider sits harder on the saddle and thats when the trouble starts. Many saddle complaints are actually traceable to fatigue caused by starting out the season with a longer ride than you are ready for.gtIf it has been several months or more since you rode a bicycle regularly you can expect to be sore if you ride any serious distance.gtIf you are coming off of a layoff of months or years start with very short rides maybe a mile or two no more. Only gradually should you increase your ride distance. This may seem frustrating but it does take a while to reaccustom your derrire to cycling. Anybody in decent shape can hop onto a bike and ride  miles but youll be a wreck afterwards if you havent accustomed your body to cycling first.gtThis is not to say that there are not real differences in saddles or that you should ride just anything. In fact originalequipment saddles that come with bikes are often greatly inferior to better aftermarket saddles.gtWhen a cyclist finds a saddle uncomfortable the first impulse is often to look for a soft one. This is often a mistake. Just as the softest mattress is not necessarily the most comfortable to sleep on the softest saddle is not the most comfortable to cycle on.a cheap but wellregarded saddle is the charge spoon,bicycling,dfr3t8k,9,t5_2qi0s

Granted where I live is not great for cyclists and the roads are crowded and narrow with no room for a cyclist and car to both occupy a road. Ive ridden on a couple of backroads to try and get used to it and I think as long as Im not having to face a crazy uphill Ill be fine.

Remember to budget for other stuff such as helmet gloves clothes maybe fenders lights bags. Last years models are often a better deal. Get one that fits. A local shop can help. If  miles is round trip other kinds of bikes might be okay. Hybrids city bikes mountain bikes with slicks.  miles each way would be a lot to bite off for a novice commuter. Five days a week  miles a day might be seriously miserable until a person gets a better fitness level. If there are other ways to work  two or three days a week on the bike might be the suggested start.

Then there is another major problem which is the fact that Id like to use her mainly as mtb and daily commuting when I go to university or other unsafe places. To answer your question I need a bike to go faster than my mtb on tarmacgravel but which can still carry some weight on it.,bicycling,dggu2ux,1,t5_2qi0s

11685667,0,t1_dgk7l41,Just a quick note on   if you can touch the ground while seated on the bike its very likely the saddle is set too low.  This is hard for beginners to accept they want the confidence to be able to put a foot down at any time but I encourage you accept that this wont be possible.  A saddle thats too low is bad for the knees while you pedal and it makes you work harder than you need to.  Its OK at first while learning to ride but once you get confident you should raise it back up again.  When stopped at a light you should be standing not sitting.,bicycling,dgkl68r,5,t5_2qi0s

11730150,0,t1_dgp8raf,The one climb that really got to me was in the final section. You are on the highway at that point and there is a long climb up to the bridge to Staten island. The good news is that once you top that climb it is a downhill roll to the finishline Ill be at the start with some friends well all have white jerseys that say Northeast Roadmasters on them. If you see is come say hi.  The good thing us that with an early start there will be a ton of riders behind you. If you dont care about how long it takes to finish and are in it for the experiance youll be fine. Just try to fight the urge to go fast if you feel good at the start save that energy for the end.
