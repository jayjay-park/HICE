140116,0,t1_ceu3nzi,Hi I am not expartI followed these Initial setup and first run.Put BinSend.exe CookComputing.XmlRpcV.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dllinto the same directory and just launch the exe file.. During startup it will ask you for your API settingsfrom the official PyBitmessage client..You can find instriuctions here API Referencebut after I run bitmessage.exe and Bitsend.exe and set the IP. username and password I get the error of unable to connect remote server.Screenshots. . . I am using Bitmessage with TOR proxy.There should be more graphical guidelines with picture or video for the noobs.,bitmessage,ceue0oi,1,t5_2vvj1

195375,0,t1_cf047w9,No not in principal as messages are encrypted layer upon layer by presumably honest middle relay nodes. ,bitmessage,cf0p0gm,2,t5_2vvj1

604607,0,t1_cg8nuf3,I think this happens when you are connected at the TCP level with the peer but the handshake packets havent been exchanged yet version and verack.If it stays like this for a long time it could mean  . a bugged client . someone developping a new client not functionnal yet . a malicious connection trying to penetrate your machine.

2289589,0,t1_clunwim,It is not meant to be used for regular mail at all. Regular mail is just a neat sideeffect.,bitmessage,clupjtk,1,t5_2vvj1
2985114,0,t3_2sg55n,What about asking the open crypto audit project The guys who audited TrueCrypt? Theyre still in their infancy but its worth a shot.,bitmessage,co7ekc5,2,t5_2vvj1
3913838,0,t1_cr1vumx,gt For something thats meant to have superprivacy and supersecurity those unencrypted files and notes like that just will result in a lot of user error.superprivacy and supersecurity calls for other measurements than single file encryption.,bitmessage,cr2ev1i,1,t5_2vvj1
3913850,0,t1_cr2evb1,the problem with encryption is that it only prevents a passive attack. Full disk encryption is better than single file encryption. If you do not encrypt the disk people can install software passively if they gain access once.File encryption only solves part of the problem. Instead operating systems should encrypt the disk per default either via password or with the TPM module,bitmessage,cr2ewtd,1,t5_2vvj1
4120140,0,t1_crpwoz2,Hi yeah having the key uploaded to the keyserver and using subkeys makes total sense. Did find the one belonging to my mailchuck address and sending an encrypted message to that worked well! Cheers!One thing that does not seem to work at the moment is checking PGP signatures though. The encrypted mail is successfully decrypted but still have the gt WARNING PGP signature missing or invalid. The authenticity of the message could not be verified.note on top of the received message. When receiving signed but not encrypted mail then both signature and encryption warning is shown even if the PGP parts are all removed from the incoming message.sent a BM to the Mailchuck bug address regarding this but still at Sending public key request for the last half an hour thats why I thought I mention it here.,bitmessage,crpx6be,1,t5_2vvj1
4863055,0,t3_3hhr42,I dont think so? One thing with bitmessage is how long propagation can take. Or proof of something or whatever. Id say give it an hour. If it hasnt changed its on you. It might just take awhile though. Im no expert though. Hopefully someone else can be more precise. ,bitmessage,cu7iww8,1,t5_2vvj1
5567072,0,t3_3r1ziz,Perhaps you werent on the network long enough or there was a port conflict? Try changing the port on one of them to something other than  and forward it as well. Then check the network status.Perhaps your isp is blocking bitmessage change both ports. Also Windows  seems to fail to connect.Also try changing your demanded difficulty to something lower say .. Less privacy but easier to send and receive.Another thing to try is to use TOR socks  on browser bundle,bitmessage,cwn59td,1,t5_2vvj1
5696506,0,t1_cx3741p,Yes. Basically if you are in the network very long then your messages will have priority should there ever be a bandwidth or processing power issue. Its a lot more difficult to implement than with bitcoin derivatives since our payload is encrypted and should not be traced back. So you would need some sort of public address that just vouches for the encrypted payload.,bitmessage,cx37fp5,1,t5_2vvj1
5869153,0,t1_cxoy829,Nothing saying tls would be disabled. It would still be hard to find the sender beyond a few hops. It just allows for a more scalable subnetwork for public discussion.,bitmessage,cxoz695,1,t5_2vvj1
5999180,0,t1_cy60d3i,Work laptop only whitelists a few programs. If i encrypt the keysticks base filesystem or use veracrypt the main program wont load. Would rather have inherently secure programs.,bitmessage,cy60ubq,3,t5_2vvj1
