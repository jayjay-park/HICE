To respond to one point gt had the store had surveillance would the NYPD not have found the culprit ?As part of my job I view a lot of NYPD distributed security surveillance tape from crime scenes. A lot of the tapes are blurry hard to make out doesnt get a good angle of the suspect or doesnt result in any positive hits to crime stoppers tip lines. A camera in your situation might have led to a positive ID and maybe even an arrest however it could have been just as useless as no camera at all.

A dog can run you a thousand per month in the city just to have a dogwalker come twice a day for  minute walks. Daycare can make it way more and then double it for two. Maybe youre rich like astronauts and dont care about a few thousand a month but if not work out the entire budget to make sure its affordable otherwise youll end up either giving up your dogs or leaving them home alone for way too long. Back to the original question  workload is actually a bit lower in my experience. With each other they have a constant companion. They will exercise by playing together and need fewer walks  just to do their business rather than for exercise. They dont get as lonely when youre away.Not sure if youve owned a dog in the city before but make sure you get a social breed thats good for a city. High energy dogs are terrible city dogs.

379735,0,t1_cfjfp09,Eh theres quite a bit more than  made guys. The Genovese and Gambinos have approx  each Lucheses Bonnanos and Colombos approx  each with the Colombos being the lightest of the three.Now if you mean out and active on the streets that number is a little bit lower but no where near . The Genovese Gambinos and Lucheses are a bit better at evading law enforcement and seemingly have deeper ties in the various mob industries the docks garbage collection construction. The Lucheses seem to have recovered from their period of strife in the s and s and the other two families never really broke down like that. For the most part they get locked up for relatively petty shit. Loan sharking etc. The last guy the feds really went after I can remember was Bartolomeo Vernace a Gambino admin member who senselessly murdered two men over a spilled drinkThe Colombos and the Bonannos have been a shit show since the s and early s. The Colombos had a major civil war in the early s that took a lot of promising talent off of the street both in body bags and into state custody. The Bonannos had a boss Joe Massino turn stool pigeon. As a result federal indictments roll out like clockwork every year against both of these families stemming from shit that happened ages ago.For all the talk about the Russians Chinese Albanians etc its comparing apples to oranges. None of those groups have the same support structure. All of these groups are essentially crews. Theyll have one activity that they excel at drugs fraud fencing stolen goods. Once the feds or the state catches wind of it and prosecutes them thats it. They all get locked up and that crew is done. Whereas in LCN if a captain and a few made guys get locked up because of one scheme therell be people to replace them. If you pick up a capo on just loan sharking charges his union racket lives on and is handed off to someone else. The feds dont really pursue the big cases that they used to back in the s and s. The Windows case the Commission trial. The strategy changed once they realized a few big cases wouldnt kill the mob. The MO these days is disruption constantly lock guys up on whatever can put them away for a few years. Plea bargains are big. This strategy oddly enough works out for both parties. The feds get their headlines every year and the gangsters never do serious time unless the feds really have the goods on them.I think what makes most people think that the mafia is over is the lack of a visible street presence unlike groups like  motor cycle clubs or regular street gangs. There are still social clubs in the city but they are few and far in between first link is Lucheses boss and construction racketeer Steve Creas restaurant in the Bronx the second is social club in Carroll Gardens of the late Genovese capo Punchy Illiano and his likely successor Albert Kid Blast Gallo brother of Crazy Joe Gallo the third actually features Genovese capo Pasquale Patsy Parello at his bar in the Bronx.tl dr the Mafia in NY still exists not as weak as most people believe but its no longer like a scene out of Goodfellas or A Bronx Tale,nyc,cfk4ics,2,t5_2qhu2

Youre there rolling your eyes like weve always known about chess but next week at the club meeting youre club is full of jocks. Ok you think maybe this is good for us. Our club is more popular now and maybe we can get more school funding or something. Then over the course of a few weeks you notice yourself resenting the jocks. When they showed up the school started funding the club and brought in new chess boards and tables and even orange slices like a real team! You walk around school and hear them all talking about how they play chess and how interesting and cerebral a game it is. But they dont even know anything about chess! They keep calling rooks tubes and theyre not even following the rules! Wow they say to their jock friends you guys gotta come to the next chess club meeting! At this point youve considered the situation youre in and decided youre just going to live your life and play chess with your friends from the old chess days. But....whats this?!? At the next meeting there are hardly any chess tables left for you! Theyve started charging for time at the tables and guess what? You cant afford more than one game a month!

449059,0,t1_cfqrjmt,And think about how much worse its going to get.  Not only is train ridership on the rise Hudson Yards and the surrounding areas are seeing a massive building boom.  Think about this Currently phase one of Hudson Yards is being built.  Its estimated to cost  billion dollars more than a billion of which is going to building a massive platform over the eastern half of the rail yard.  This will support large amounts of retail open space and the culture shed designed for performing arts shows etc in addition to a  foot office tower currently rising a  foot office tower undergoing site prep but slated to rise in the next few months and two high rise apartment buildings.  You can look at one of the artistic overviews here  This will add millions of square feet of residential retail and ClassA office space to the area which can be accessed by the  train but think about all the people who are going to come into Penn Station using the subwaysLIRRAmtrak then proceed to walktake a taxi to Hudson Yards phase .  But wait there is more! Manhattan West located between Penn and Hudson Yards is currently undergoing construction.  Like Hudson Yards it requires a massive platform to be constructed over an open section of rail between st and rd streets.  Manhattan West will be home to at least two office towers millions of square feet of space plus retail and residential.  Though not as large as Hudson Yards it still promises to be a massive project drawing many people from both NYC and the region to it.  Manhattan West unlike Hudson Yards doesnt have direct train  and given that its even closer to Penn Station than Hudson Yards is people will go directly to Penn then walk two blocks to the west to get there.  Can you imagine how many more pedestrians that is going to add to the mix?  To give you a feeling for how large this project is check out this picture of the hole it is covering and the launcher being used to cover it  essentially a giant crane dropping huge precast concrete forms into place.   All this development is spurring ancillary growth to the north and south of rd streets.  There are numerous condo projects being proposed including a . million square foot retailresidential complex two tower complex  the one slightly taller than the other two tower complex by Larry Silverstein the guy behind much of the WTC complex.  There are also at least two other highrises planed for sites directly north of the Hudson rail yards including one being marketed as a site for a potential  foot tower and industry rumor says the RE firm behind it is getting flooded with inquiry.  In other words even if that particular proposal doesnt get built the site is very coveted for something big.   The first two office towers at Hudson Yards will be topped out within three years and occupied within four.  The first phase of Hudson Yards could be built out in as little as five.  This area of New York is set to become a city within a city and will see the ingressegress of hundreds of thousands of people a day many of whom will go through Penn Station.  Even if none of this growth were taking place Penn Station is not equipped to handle the traffic it has now nor could it handle the projected increases in public transport a trend occurring nation wide.  The massive boom on the west side however will make it truly unusable for all.  Unfortunately even if everything goes smoothly and by some miracle MSG were to vacate on the day their permit expired which lets face it is unlikely this part of town will already be largely built out.  Given the glacial pace at which the city moves coupled with an ever corruptinefficient process for selecting a project and actually building it it will be at least  decades before a new Penn Station is born.  The problem is NYC really needs it in five years or less.  ,nyc,cfrb5y5,2,t5_2qhu2

However after experiencing the prohibitively high rents or rather seeing how much what Im paying would get me in another city! Im leaving after graduation. I think a turn of events will probably find me back here someday but it isnt really a great place for postgrads who have to look for a job after graduation as opposed to those who find something permanent while still in school.

511897,0,t3_1zzbw6,Warning incoming long fucking post.  But worth the read IMO.Didnt happen in NYC but Boston but figured I would share anyway.My senior year of school my roommate and I want to get a place off campus.  In typical stoner fashion we wait until too late and end up scrambling to find a place.  Everything is either really far away or way too expensive.However eventually we stumble onto a place to that is too good to be true.  It is a beautiful multifamily home nice hardwood floors moderately priced and right on campus.  We are sold.  Except we need  people but figure we will have no problem finding a couple of subletters.  But because we didnt have a ton of money at the time we made a deal with the landlord that we would pay him the last months rent once the subletters moved in.  He was very amiable to the plan.First sign of problems with the place is right when we move in.  The other people are still moving a few things out and we talk to them asking them how the landlord is and if we will be able to have a few mild parties.  They are very dodgy with their answers.  It is clear in retrospect that they were trying to be nice and not scare us but really they should have been more clear with their warnings.We also find out that in the other unit lives the landlords son.  As we are moving in we meet him.  The front doors opens to two doors one to our apartment and one to his.  Standing in that small opening after introducing himself he says I have guns upstairs.  If I see anyone past my door and he looks us both squarely in the eyes I will shoot them.  I think he is joking and laugh but he doesnt laugh back he just stares me in the eyes for a couple more seconds.  Creepy and scary.  But I just chalk it up to him being weird and say I dont have to worry because I will never go near his apartment.Like we guessed I find a friend who needs a place with her boyfriend Fabio and we sublet to them.  On the day they are moving in my roommate and I take a trip to the city.  When we get back they arent there and none of their stuff is there.  I find a note on the kitchen counter that reads paraphrased Sorry we wont be moving in.  Got evicted. Good luck.  WTF?So I call her up.  Basically her bf had propped the front door open so he could move stuff literally from the curb into the apartment so he was always within  feet of the front door and the son came home and got angry at him for propping the door open possibly letting thieves into his apartment.  Fabio doesnt take kindly to this and argues with him about how ridiculous it is consider he is always within sight of the door.  The son doesnt like him talking back calls his father who comes over and evicts them.  I dont think he could do that but they hadnt paid yet and it was clear the landlord and son were crazy so they did the smart thing and got out I have no ill will towards them at all.The next day the landlord comes over demanding last months rent because that was the deal.  I say the deal was that we would pay when the subletters moved in and you evicted them.  He told me not to talk back to him and demanded the money again.  I eventually worked out with him that we would pay him a bit each month because we didnt have the money.The son was more or less friendly too us which was unexpected after the first day.  We would chat and he would be friendly overall.  One day he called me over to the trunk of his car.  I knew better than to refuse but also better than to actually go over. . . but I had to go over.  In the trunk of his car and I am no gun person so I dont know exactly what it was I was also pretty stoned at the time there was this HUGE gun with a couple of handguns too.  It was not a gun you would run around with.  It looked like you set it down in place and just started to mow people down with it.  He was telling me about how it was illegal but he got it anyway.  He was very proud.  I am not sure how the conversation drifted but he started to talk about his father our landlord.  He told me how his dad use to abuse him emotionally and physically.  And how I had no idea how hard it was to come home every day and be told you were a complete worthless fuck up. He kept going on and on. . .and as he was talking I could see him kind of drifting away like into that  mile stare and getting more and more angry.  I honestly didnt know if he would stop before shooting me so I kind of slowly backed away telling him how I had to go study.  It didnt matter that I was leaving he just kept rambling on to no one.The next few months between august and december are filled with basically fearing for our lives and being totally uncomfortable in the apartment.  My room was on the second floor we split the second floor with the sons apartment and I constantly heard the guy having screaming fights with his fiancee.  I could tell he never hit her but they would break shit he would punch the walls and they would screech at each other for hours on end at all hours of the day.One night we were taking bong hits in the apartment with one of my socially awkward friends and he came home with a friend from the bar.  Being drunk he pretty much just walked into our apartment with his friend and asked to smoke with us.  I knew it was a bad idea but what was I going to do?Long story short for that night his friend kept asking over and over again who we got the stuff from and this freaked my friend out who thought he was a narc the friend didnt smoke with us.  The son saw my friend being nervous and started kind of singling him out which made everything even more awkward.  That night he also told us how it was actually the house he had grown up in and that his mother died in one of the rooms. . .which is why IMO they were so protective of the place.  All that did was make things more awkward for the weeks to come.We eventually found one new subletter but it was a couple of months because the semester had already started and so we lost a bunch of money paying double rent.  And then another who would move in on January first.  We eventually pay about half of last months rent to the landlord.  But it was always tense when it came time to talk about money.Come January first the new guy moving in hadnt given us the money yet and we were all away on winter break anyway so we didnt get all of the rent to him on time he got it on the rd of the month.  But this was the final straw for him.He came over to our apartment one morning and just unlocked the door and came right in flanked by his two sons who are both big guys neither my roommate nor I are very big.  My roommate is Asian BTW more on this in a minute.I hear my roommate arguing with them that they cant just come in and they are yelling that it is their place and hey can do whatever they want.  So I quickly go down as back up.  When I get down there he starts yelling at me too and then eventually turns to my roommate and says your people are always trying to screw my people!  This blatant show of racism fires my roommate up even more and they are literally about to physically fight each other.  I grab my roommate and say dude get the fuck out of here.  You arent helping.  I know it wasnt his fault but I knew he would understand and I think happily he went back to his room.So I am sitting there with the landlord and his two sons who are all blatantly trying to physically intimidate me.  The landlord starts threatening my life and the lives of my family and we are talking about  dollars right now keep in mind.  The son who lives upstairs is starts talking about how he knows we have been smoking pot down here really?  You smoked with us asshole.  The landlord then evicts us on the spot demands that we give him the rest of last months rent and move out.  However we have already paid him for January so he actually has to pay us the  dollars because we wont be staying for last month AND we need the security deposit back.  He keeps saying that is not the way it works and that we own him the other half.The other son eventually realized that I was in the right.  He physically pulled his dad outside came back in and said look if I give you the security deposit and the other half of last months rent will you just move out?Happily.So right after that I call my dad who puts me in touch with a lawyer.  The lawyer basically says cut your losses and get the fuck out.  So we pack up our stuff and move.  We actually got the  dollars from them for last month rent but they took out most of the security deposit charging us for an unpaid bill by the previous tenant and water damage to the apartment below us that had happened long before we moved in.  Whatever I took it as a win for me because the lawyer told me I would likely get nothing.But the moral of this story to me is that if it seems too good to be true it probably is.,nyc,cfyget2,19,t5_2qhu2

The common portrayal of her neighbors as being fully aware but completely unresponsive has since been criticized as inaccurate.    Nonetheless it prompted investigation into the social psychological phenomenon that has become known as the bystander effect or Genovese syndrome  and especially diffusion of responsibilitygtGenoveses killer Winston Moseley was found guilty and sentenced to death on June  . That sentence was later reduced to lifetime imprisonment on the grounds that he had not been allowed to argue during the trial that he was medically insane. Moseley committed another series of crimes when he escaped from custody on March   and then fled to a nearby vacant home where he held the owners hostage. On March  he broke into another home and took a woman and her daughter hostage before surrendering to police. Moseley who was denied parole for a seventeenth time in December  remains in prison.  He is currently one of the longest serving inmates in New York State. gtgtImage iInteresting Bystander effect | Kew Gardens Queens | Death of Wang Yue | Murder of Penny Bell Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcgsm oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecgsm.

841744,0,t1_cgyzg1y,gtThe tax brackets put in place by certain rich people exploit the poor. There are plenty of nice rich people and Im sure they make generous contributions but simply paying a fair share of taxes helps everyone and reduces the need for charity in the first place. So Im not impressed by their charity. If they really want to impress me pay a  tax rate like I do. Can you blame the rich for maximizing their deductions? Everyone does the same but the tax brackets were put up by who the PEOPLE voted for. The mindless masses aimlessly vote based on party racial or looks compared to whom would benefit the country more. Most people dont even know who is who and what the politician stands for at the ballots. gtMost dont realize that they get gigantic tax benefits for doing it and its not a spontaneous act of goodwill. The tax benefits are not as big as you think it is. Our biggest tax benefits are from capital gains in investments. When it comes to charities we donate based on what we believe in instead of letting the govt decide by catering to special interest groups.,nyc,cgzyj7b,1,t5_2qhu2

Hauge convention banned hollowpoints for war domestic protection is free to use them.As for the triggers they were chosen for the exact reason I stated.  To replicate the trigger on the old service revolvers. The fact that they only allow pistols that have that ridiculous trigger is relqted to the original issue of revolver trained cops shooting themselves on holstering. In fact your lawyer says assumption puts the wrongful death of civilian byatanders on the shoulders of the police department. No lawyer would do that they may argue that thats why the cop missed but thats not the reason for the trigger. Your cause and effect are backwards.These modified double action only firearms are actually  made with anincreased trigger pull the p is actually modified wo that it doesnt operate like any ther p all others switch to single action after the first shot nypd siys dont.

Something horrible and tragic happened and rather than look at the facts and actually take steps to prevent it from happening again we would rather just make stuff up....escalate the situation to the point that there is no solvency.  This police officer was already in the wrong before we decided to invent stories about him being a racist vampire alien overlord that kicks puppies.  This entire thread is full of people trying to one up each other on their out rage.  I would kill this cop  Oh yeah I would kill this cop and all cops!  Oh yeah i would kill this cop and all cops and their families and then skull fuck their pets!Its like people are trying to show how good they are by being outrageously outraged.This entire situation was bad enough without having to go Oh RACISM!  Not everything is about Race.  And unfortunately when something IS about race you cant do anything about it because people are weary of hearing cries of racism so they are apathetic.Honestly maybe I would be willing to hear the racial argument if there was anything in this video to point to that.

He is the citys chief auditor and as such is in charge of The books so to speak. He has no power to prevent a ComcastTime Warner merger but part of his duties include publishing recommendations like the PDF you linked to. Here is the Wikipedia article on the NYC ComptrollerAnd second... Did you even read the PDF? Because if you did youd notice that the entire thing is him being incredibly wary of the merger pointing out Comcasts poor performance record and him pushing for and rationalizing net neutrality legislation. It sounds to me like if Scott Stringer had his way the merger wouldnt go through.So like do you have a bone to pick with Stringer or something?

For sure Times Square buildings and the like probably create the most light pollution per area but light pollution refers to the ambient light created by humans the bounces up into the atmosphere creates skyglow confuses animals and makes the stars harder to see. Previous street light designs didnt do a very good job of directing as much of their light as possible downward onto the street and as a result the sky over the city would glow from the misdirected illumination. The streets lights of NYC certainly create more light in total than Times Squares billboards and thus changing their design to direct as much of their light downward is the most effective way of reducing light pollution. That said the lights of Times Square are still serious offenders. But were not removing street lights.,nyc,cjc140o,7,t5_2qhu2

1593217,0,t1_cjfo25v,Training can only do so much to be able to gauge how much force you should be using in certain situations against certain individuals. Or even the language you use when interacting with them.Some of the things Police Officers will say to some people will seem hideous and outrageous to civilians and people will wonder how they can get away with it and demand the officers head.Cameras will be great along with continued proper notetaking. Some of the videos shot on cameraphones could do with that extra angle and  minutes of footage beforehand can help explain the situation unfolding.I feel like having all of those different weapons makes little sense without proper training experience and a certain type of individual wearing a badge.It seems like too many shootings happen because the officers are too scared to approach dangerous situations in a more calm and calculated manner. That they reach for their guns too soon and then theyre at that point of no return.Until policing goes away from revenue collection and enforcing unjust racist laws then its probably going to stay in this crappy situation as where is the desire to employ a higher caliber of police officer that has some critical thinking skills?,nyc,cjfzuat,-1,t5_2qhu2

I was sitting reading my book surrounded by a family of tourists there were two teenage boys all decked out in Yankees gear happy chatting and munching on snacks.When they finished the cheezits they threw their garbage under the seat. It immediately annoyed me but I didnt say anything. When they pulled out wetnaps and cleaned their hands and then threw those under the seat as well I spoke up. I kindly asked that they use the trash cans in the future.Their mom overheard me and immediately started in on the boys in Spanish. The got on their knees ewww picked up the trash and held onto it.

He argues the same process will come to pass if the controllers of the internets master switch the ISPs are allowed to become monopoly or the main services Google become closed rather than open.He may suggest this isnt completely dystopian because its happened before and its impossible for oligopolies to hold control forever because the longer you kill your own technological innovations the sooner someone will develop an alternative but its still terrible.

2043378,0,t1_ckzbnkk,Hmm  as I was there at the time talking to them I can tell you that what they did not want was a religious corrupt autocracy imposed through rigged elections. And even for the sake of argument if the elections were legitimate it would have been a corruption of the democratic process to get elected and then impose your will on the population by dictat  as Morsithe Brotherhood did  by writing their own constitution stacking the parliament and then forcing its approval along with taking dictatorial powers placing him and his party above the courts and above the military. This is why millions of people  both religious and secular took to the streets of Egypt last summer. Yes  they did want democracy. But elections are not the starting point of democracy they are the final expression of  a free unintimidated and ruleabiding government and society read Natan Sharanskys The Case for Democracy for a longer explanation of the proper role of elections. Many dictators and tyrants came to power through the ballot box  Hitler and Hamas were both elected. The electoral process itself can be rigged and the dictator can impose his will on the people after the elections take place  whether they were rigged or not. Quotes Democracy is like a train  you take it to the station you want and then get off or One man one vote one time.Dictators and democracyMorsi seizing unconstitutional powersMorsi forcing constitution on EgyptAnd lastly To quote an Egyptian activist There is no such thing as Egyptian democracy. Democracy is democracy. You cannot impose your will on the people and call that democracyAnd final note The above comment is not to excuse the excesses of alSisi the police or the interior ministry in their crackdown on the Brotherhood I was there for that as well  I could hear the gunfire from Ramses Square as I was staying on Ramses street  the crackdown and subsequent jailings and sentences were excessive  even though the Brotherhood protesters had amassed stockpiles of weapons and were firing on them and killing them and their crackdown on all who criticize them journalists and secular activists included. It is solely about the people and their desire for democracy.

2081217,0,t1_cl422h5,Im often curious to what extent shoulds actually exist.   In a broad sense Id say that what can happen does happen.  A fun hypothetical  if the us could have become a dominant world power is there any chance it wouldnt have?  Not is there only a slim chance? Literally is there any chance?In actual fact this has never been possible because of the threat of other nuclear states.  However lets assume that from a purely military perspective they could.  At that point it comes down to the opinion of the leaders and the population.  Arguably opinion of the population is actually a military factor in that it would impact US ability to wage effective war.  Effects ability to draftrecruit morale of the troops ability to harness industrial machine etc.. With the current military it would be impossible to conquer the world without a basic level of ongoing approval from the population.  Therefore if the population does not want war for any reason because of what they think we should be doing or because they dont feel like doing it.The same is true for the people in power  everyone who has the capability to scuttle the war effort either through a direct no foot dragging or some other means must be on board.  If they resist because they dont think war is right or just because they dont feel like warring the war efforts fails.Therefore in order for the US to be able to conquer the world power holders including the population would have to want to.  Where want can just  equal Id rather go along with this than get shot for treason.In this scenario if these groups want to conquer the world they will.  If any of them dont they cant.  Not just wont cant.Returning to the should vs dont feel like it thing I often wonder  is there really a distinction between I dont want war because Im a pacifist and I dont want war because it would kill my multinational corporations profits.Morality as we traditionally understand it seems to hinge on the idea that there is a difference of kind between these wants.  If we place moral stances in wantlanguage though does this distinction survive?  In other words if we take pacifists at their word and understand pacisfism to  I want a world without war.Typical dividing lines between moral want statements and want statements in general include that moral want statements are based on principle or that  moral want statements are altruistic on some level at least from the worldview of the beliefholder.Im not sure distinctions like these really warrant a division of kind between the statements though. For example if altruismmotivation is the dividing line all that really whats the difference between altruisticallymotivated wants and others?  The jihadist seeks to impose sharia law out of a genuine desire to save the worlds souls and the schizophrenic shoots the newscaster out of a genuine desire to save the populous from subliminal mind control.  In both cases we could argue that to most of us theres little practical value to knowing that the actors motives were altruistic beyond deciding how to punish them or something like that.  We see what they want and we know that it is not what we want so we take action against them.  The fact that we take action because we disagree about what would be best for all of us isnt relevant.Really in a lot of cases statements really just boil down to want statements that a lot of people are likely to agree with.  Because they share a common world view or common interests or whatever.If x group of people want to take over the world and can they will.  The only thing stopping them is the can. Often of course the barrier to the can is getting other people to want the same thing.  This sort of neuters my original inflammatory statement to the much more measured if x wants to do something and can x will. Although if wanting is understood as part of capability it would still stand.Should portions of discussions about wants  just boil down to relevant wills deciding what they want based on general desire to not be evil or to stamp out war  irrelevant wills trying to sway relevant wills by appealing to them in a certain way.  Wouldnt a world without war be nice? We both want that.  Invading would work against that want..... And Ive talked myself into a corner.  Not sure where I was going with this.,nyc,cl4d9sc,0,t5_2qhu2

2124601,0,t3_2j7jgx,Been around the tracks at different points in my life. It definitely runs through some incredibly shady parts of Queens amp Brooklyn. Im apprehensive because I know  this is part of the postHigh Line hype thats moving across the country  some of the neighborhoods are sketch like we said. The High Line is great and is pretty and nice to look at but this Queensway has the chance to be more functional. It wont become the tourist destination that the High Line is. With absolutely zerospace to build another sorely needed QueensBrooklyn connection this is a big decision.Being a life long resident of BrooklynQueens and having commuted through Jamaica through Woodhaven etc. to Fort Greene many many times I really really think a Queens ltgt Brooklyn subway line would be much more valuable than a park. I currently use the buses along Woodhaven to get to my girlfriends old neighborhood Woodhaven and all the way to Rockaway Beach. Problem is there is no direct connection to the EMFR line on the northern end and I dont know how that would be resolved... but it surely runs right into the JZ and AC.  Theres no other chance to build another sorely needed QueensBrooklyn line without digging up the ground way more expensive or building a fresh new noisy elevated subway track. Theres no other chance the city needs to take this time to build a vital connection. The spread of gentrification or density or whatever you want to call it is unstoppable. More people will be moving further and further out and will need more ways to move around efficiently. We need more transport. Whats going to carry more people a bike path or a fullfledged subway line?edit sorry for the rant. Ive been moving along this section of QueensBrooklyn since high school via the AC JZ and bus.

Doesnt seem right that a stack of squares should be able to stand that tall.  But it does.  Its standing right there squares all the way up and down no sign of any trussing or weight bearing columns  just squares.Now Im not saying this is the most beautiful building going up right now  not by a long shot.

Let me explain.I come from a nation where there is a special name for this particular behavior  It is called Eve Teasing. Eve teasing or Street Harassment of women means . Your breasts getting groped by a complete stranger while you are walking to buy groceries. . Someone sliding their dirty hands on your Vagina while you walk to school. . Exhibitionists exposing themselves to school girls. . Being molested in trains buses and every form of public transportation. In a place where law and order is nonexistent and there is little or no support from police women just accept their fate and adjust their lives to accommodate the perverts on the streets. It means having to schedule your traveleven within your town or city in groups or with a male member of your friends or family. Accepting it can happen to anyone anywhere. God Forbid you have to walk by that shady part of town to get to your favorite library. Women dare not step outside because it is after . PM.There have been deaths associated with Street Harassment  once a college freshman was walking to her college when two men riding their bikeone seated behind the other grabbed her scarf. They were calling her sexy names while holding on to her scarf. In a matter of moments her scarf was tangled she was dragged across the rough road and died of her injuries. THIS HAPPENED. THIS IS STREET HARASSMENT.I dont know much about New York. But you know what this country has? Law and Order. Those men who harassed her in the New York video know they cannot step out of line. The police are still feared and respected. Only when Law and order breaks down can perverts show their true colors. I am not saying all men are perverts. Some are. It is just a matter of time.

Like say the guy was real and older he likely wouldnt have let a journalist see his trade history or have live interactive access to his account at all and even if he did it can still be faked. A business oriented journalist though would have had no trouble figuring out the deception key facts were missing like starting values etc but the author Jessica Pressler writes mostly about personalities as her website says or profiles as the rest of world says and doesnt have a business background Also the piece wasnt an article in itself but a list of  reasons to love New York which is a pretty much unconnected listicle of  little puff pieces. Jessicas other piece for the list was about a journalist and former subject getting marriedSo basically a profile writer writing one of a bunch of puff pieces got conned.

For the fires I would suggest you compare the housing stock. Which borough comprises mostly wood frame housing? Unfortunately I couldnt find fire stats broken down by borough but I suspect we have more to worry about than the others especially when it comes to wildfires which are so regular an occurrence people use them to mark the seasons.As per the road point Im not sure what youre saying are you agreeing with me? The report says that were nearly the worst road quality among boroughs except for that borough with the smallest footprint most number of roads per square mile all of its utilities buried underneath roads and has been the focus of a massive street transformation for the last at least  years.

How about if a woman swiped your wallet? Yes shed be a thief and hes a rapist but your inability to distinguish the functional difference between the public and private  and for that matter some utopian fantasy  is grossly juvenile and narcissistic. Society can protect its citizens from fellow criminals through the judiciary but it cannot baby every one of you to the point that the subway is your crib. This is the same phenomenon that can allow a lb black man to die resisting arrest to turn into a politically correct convulsion against the police.Its too bad any of these things have to happen but instead of being so tediously selfabsorbed perhaps you should ask why am I finding myself so exhausted that I have to sleep on the train? What force in society has brought me to need a  hour shift or to deal cigarettes on a corner? Maybe if I had free health care or a higher minimum wage or didnt spend  on a new phone every  months I could work less and be less tired.

They said they were waiting for me outside my house  luckily I was at work at the time  but they said theyd be at the cafe on the corner until I came back. I immediately called the police to ask for help and advice. They werent very helpful. I then went to my boyfriends house after work instead and went to the nearest precinct. The NYPDs way of helping me was to ask to see the messages and calls. The cop then proceeded to call the number and confront the guy. He threatened him and the guy said CrazyAsshole asked him to do this all and that hed stop. I didnt know anyone named CrazyAsshole but thought for a bit and realized it was someone in one of my classes that i barely went to and spoke to for maybe  minutes during a class discussion once. The cop said that should do it. They handed me back my phone and had me leave without filing any report. The calls stopped but it made things very ackward and scary for a long while. Anytime I was on campus I was alert and tried to never be alone. Turns out CrazyAsshole took a strong liking to me instantly and then spotted me on a weekend I went back home because it turned out we were from the same town. I have no idea how long he may have been watching me in order to learn my home address general info about my family places I go to. Im not sure what his intentions were or what he had the other guy doing for him or why the hell the other guy would agree to help stalk and terrorize someone. But OP should definitely be mindful.

3029663,0,t1_cobze0z,Did you not bother to read the article thats been linked here?Ill quote you the relevant passages gtIts never cheap to operate a ferry network. In fact the Rockaway ferry was running the city as much as  a passenger in subsidies.In other words for everyone who uses the ferry system to reach the Rockaways the city government spends .. Of tax payer money money that we all pay even if we dont use the Rockaways ferry.And since many most people wont be using that ferry at all. That isnt really a reasonable way to spend public money.Before you say the subways are subsidized too yes they are but at a much much lower rate. And the subways are used directly or indirectly by every New Yorker. This city would not work without the subways period. So expecting everyone to pay for them is not that unreasonable.The ferry system by contrast will cost us a lot and have little to no impact on our lives this makes it an inefficient use of money.gtFor  million in capital funds and optimistically  million in annual operating costs the city could do wonders for the bus network. Instead de Blasio is spending his political capital on a system that likely wont see daily ridership exceed that of  or  peakhour subway trains.In other words were spending  million dollars start up and  to  million dollars annually for two subway trains worth of pedestrian movement annually.For that price we could make major modifications and improvements to the bus network which would move  to Xs more people for the same price.Just because it doesnt require new construction or street modifications doesnt mean that this ferry system will be in any way cheap. You need new ferries  You need pilots and crew You need facilities and you need to maintain those facilities You need maintenance crews Just because you dont need to modify the river doesnt in any way suggest that this is an inexpensive option.Its  million dollars with  million more each year that should be used to improve bus to upgrade the subway system because these improvements would actually have some impact on congestion.Ferries sound cool but theyre more or less worthless for confronting the scale of the problem were talking about.This is a political play notice that we are talking about it its a move to make DeBlasio seem like hes doing something. So that he can point at something and say look at the city wide ferry network. Its a lot less exciting to say look at the improvements to the bus service. Because mostly people dont notice subtle improvements even if they have a major impact. We notice new stuff not unseen improvements to old stuff.Reduce  peoples average commute length by  minute thats a huge improvement. But to the individual to the voter they barely notice. So when they go to vote as far as theyre concerned DeBlasio did nothing.But announce a new ferry system and when you go to the poles you might remember that it exists. Sure you dont use it but presumably many other people are using it thus DeBlasio is improving the city.Get what Im driving at here?,nyc,coc0t36,3,t5_2qhu2

3089661,0,t1_coi81u3,Interesting. I was under the impression that from the NYPD Patrol GuidegtMembers of the New York City Police Department will NOT use chokeholds. A chokehold shall include but is not limited to any pressure to the throat or windpipe which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air.Im really not sure how to parse that. The patrol guide has the text that indicates any pressure which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air. The article you posted uses this textgtAnd it was a headlock not a chokehold. To be a chokehold there must be constant pressure on the persons neck compressing his windpipe or cutting off the flow of blood to the carotid artery rendering him unconscious.Id be more inclined to accept the NYPDs patrol guide as a definition of what the NYPD considers a chokehold though Ill admit I think the actions of the officers in that case were criminal and negligent. That said  are you or the NYPost? I dont wanna put words in your mouth arguing that the officers hold had no chance at restricting airflow? The hold he has him in in the picture in the article you posted has the back of his hand directly on Garners windpipe area. Thoughts?,nyc,coi8pne,-1,t5_2qhu2
3090564,0,t1_coia8s4,Agreed there need to be more ways for commuters to get to their train station For example one of my coworkers takes a short jitney ride to his station in Jersey and as long as the car is king of suburbia there has to be an easy way to park it all day at the train station. We need to discourage private car use within city limits in every way possible and one of the best ways to do that is to provide more convenient alternatives to commuters.

3219221,0,t3_2wzs5n,How much of these delays are at least somewhat seasonal? Ive noticed in the mornings that the buses SBS downtown is a lot less crowded when the weather is bad. Probably because no one wants to stand out in the coldrainsnow waiting for a bus. Im assuming that a decent chunk of bus riders will take the nearest subway instead when the weather is bad making overcrowding during bad weather  cold months worse.Especially for rush hour going  uptown is always a crapshoot after PM but I feel like its worse when its cold out because who the fuck wants to stand and wait in temperatures that are barely double digits with a thumb up the ass hoping the bus will show up soon. Might as well go underground and wait in relative comfort.Alsogt My commute to work is consistently a half hour or even longer than necessary because they refuse to run enough No.  trains at rush hour. My train uptown home often takes  minutes or more to arrive at rush hour. When it does its often too crowded to get on.Not sure how I feel about throwing more trains at the problem. More cars on the tracks just makes it all stopandgo if you are in anything but the first two or three cars in the block. Not really sure how that would be solved in the first place TBH especially since people lose all semblance of sanity trying to get onto the cars during rush hour anyways so youre guaranteed to get stuck waiting because Joe Asshole and Jane Bagsaplenty absolutely had to get in before anyone else could get off.,nyc,covoal3,5,t5_2qhu2

According to MacKinnon the statement which had previously been attached to feminist Andrea Dworkin was made up by the pornography industry in an attempt to undermine her credibility. It became inextricably linked with MacKinnons name after she began working with Dworkin in the early s to write model antipornography laws.gt Dworkin has also disavowed the quote as a false statement circulated by her opponents. She has denied saying that all sex is rape or all men are rapists. When asked to explain her views on the topic Dworkin replied Penetrative intercourse is by its nature violent. But Im not saying that sex must be rape. What I think is that sex must not put women in a subordinate position. It must be reciprocal and not an act of aggression from a man looking only to satisfy himself.

3817576,0,t3_342wug,If you check my post history on this sub youll know that Ive had some recent run ins with gas leaks and fucking horrible landlords. Short story being that me and my girlfriend reported  gas leaks in our building in  month and then promptly had our lease renewal rescinded right after the second report.Im tired of talking about it but I just wanted to mention this We moved. In our new building guess what? GAS! We were going fucking crazy especially because it was such a tiny smell coming from behind our gas stove and only sometimes but it was there. Because of our bad experience with our last management company actually retaliating at us we wanted to be like the perfect nice little tenants so we went to the super and management instead of Con Ed immediately. Well super didnt smell it and couldnt find it they called a maintenance guy who couldnt find it or smell it. They were looking at us like we were crazy and we were feeling crazy but being that within the past handful of months weve accurately detected multiple gas leaks we were sure we were right. We insisted that they called an actual plumber and... well they fucking found it and replaced the whole pipe. Thank god the super and management have been super nice to us since then unlike the fucking hellhole of a management company that we previously had. But as nice as they were we wasted a whole day escalating up the ladder until eventually someone came who knew wtf they were doing.Anyway moral of the story is that management and supers are crapchutes for this stuff. Maybe theyll be helpful but theyre probably going to do the most minimal amount of work. CALL CON ED. This is their job and theyre trained for it. They dont give a shit if the landlord or management will kick and scream about their gas being shut off and having to deal with angry tenants and theyll do their job.Also jesus christ fuck gas leaks man.,nyc,cqrfn0e,4,t5_2qhu2

Its not possible right now for the system to be without conductors. I think they do a pretty good job for the most part.

Theres also some unfriendly and useless ones out there. But at less traveled stations and especially during off hours they usually are doing very little.

3834712,0,t1_cqtdjv5,It was a looooong time ago but I will give it a go. For starters the guys on the forklifts and vehicles have the good jobs. They probably work for the arena  and just manage the operation and drive the palettes around on forklifts. Part timers and contractors tend to do the heavy lifting. The hard part is the floors because it takes humans to get those up and stackunstack. Most of what you are seeing here is just the things you stack the floor sections on moving around. Bottom line is its all piece by piece. As seamless as it looks it is a giant puzzle.You are basically seeing sections of floor removed and put on a palette eventually scooped up by the forklift and taken to storage. The gray floor underneath is most likely the very bottom or base of the arena. Probably concrete. At the same time you are seeing a reconfiguration of the seating. Most are on wheels and can be moved around collapsed etc. If I remember correctly there is a buffer softer layer underneath the wood floors. Not so for hockey which goes on that bare floor. Once the wood floors are up you are seeing the hockey boards and glass going up. The boards are bolted down with a massive power tool bolt tightening thing. We fought over who got to do that because it is pretty awesome. Then these plastic? been a while flooring goes down that is fitted together. It is white as you see with the hockey lines etc. Once that is down and all the seating is reconfigured the very last part was  the ice. I am really foggy on this part But I believe it is just flooded with water. By this stage it is like am and me and my friends were done and exhausted. Arena staff handled the ice part. But again I think it is just lightly flooded with water and the flooring underneath cools.I could be wildly off on the details but that is how I remember it. My part in the job was just the heavy lifting and some bolt tightening when I was lucky. Literally the bulk of the job at any arena is the lifting and removing of floors lifting and placing of floors and seating reconfiguration. Of course I am leaving out all the cool stuff like lighting audio electric etc that is all going on at the same time.,nyc,cqte2kp,46,t5_2qhu2

Most people dont need to drive.  They do not need cars.  We have sidewalks bikes subways buses CitiBike taxis even Uber nowadays.  The cost of obtaining a private automobile needs to be drastically increased to account for their outsized stress and cost to our city in terms of pollution damage to roads accidents assaults on pedestrians damage to cyclists blockage of bicycle lanes automotive crime and theft loss of revenue for mass transit and the removal of public sidewalks in favor of private parking spotsAs it stands these costs are currently being paid by all of us for the benefit of the very greedy few.  The typical driver who will think nothing of dumping oil down a storm drain driving on a sidewalk or dooring a cyclist would be forced to rethink private car ownership if the taxes on private automobiles and the cost of licenses were brought in line with the global norm.Frankly Im fed up with subsidizing private car ownership.

Sometimes on previous generation cars a part will no longer be produced by the automaker who instead label a third party as OE spec.Remanufactured parts are prone to failure primarily for the same reasons as the originals.  The largest room for error here is the proper assemblyinstallation and regular preventative maintenance.

Im just tired of the fear mongering and doom and gloom from the media which is actively misleading people.  A couple weeks ago the news media was shouting that NYC was going down hill it was a return to NYCs gritty old days because shootings were up  year over year! OMG!!! The sky is falling!!! Bring back stop and frisk!!! which was statistically proven to be completely ineffective at stopping gun violence but whatever They have now become more normalized to only up . year over year but that isnt being plastered all over the place. Yet Im sure people still think shootings are still WAY up because that doesnt sell fear to the masses.    Were still on track to have the third safest year in the city in the past  years possibly even second safest now with less shootings and less murders than at any point during stop and frisk  and we are increasing our police force  including  new members to the counter terrorism force which hasnt stopped a single terrorist attack or done anything of note in the past decade.   Over the past decade our operating budget has continued to increase by billions year after year even during the recession.  I have nothing against cops I just dont think we need all the cops we currently have  never mind needing MORE. Is that so crazy? ,nyc,csg2n7g,0,t5_2qhu2

Specifically in Bklyn there was a formerly notorious neighborhood where groups bought up property and then years later stocked the area specifically with certain groups of people. I remember CL ads of the time specifically catered to transplant artists be part of the vibrant upcoming art scene we love artists and musicians etc. I saw out my window brokers handpicking clients we would joke about who he was going to go to meet and whose cell phone ring he would ignore based on the looks of the person getting out of the car...its the whole little game the LL and the city plays and the LL try to get around whatever rules are in place.

4625855,0,t1_ctdl9dk,I dont know what thats supposed to mean but the article you provided actively ignores the extreme differences between the ancient and medieval institutions of slavery and the institution as it existed in the Americas during the Modern Era. The feudal economic and social framework that ancient and medieval slavery undergirded no longer exists. Coincidentally it was replaced by the Capitalist mode of production which our society now rests upon. The first phase of the development of our current production was the development of global markets. Specifically this was the production and exportation of agricultural commodities from the Americas to Europe. The intensive nature of agricultural production in the South the Indies and South American coast made the importation of waged European laborers unprofitable. Not only did the kidnapping importation and auctioning of enslaved Africans provide a profitable source of labor for plantations the establishment of markets which traded in such chattel formed the economic foundation of future American cities like Boston New York and Philadelphia. Moreover slavery formed the enduring superstructure of the United States economy that being the mass production of commodities whose exchange value was not linked to the value of that labor which produced them. In the instance of African slavery it would be a raw good such as cotton or tobacco which essentially represented a total surplus value to the landowner but obviously perpetuated the enslavement of the labor which actually produced it. Its not coincidental that many freed slaves became sharecroppers working the fields of the same whites who had owned them as chattel before the war.An overwhelming majority of black Americans directly link their ancestry to agricultural slaves some only go back two generations to enslavement. The economic structure of our country is virtually identical to the Antebellum US. To suggest that somehow something like the enslavement of Celts by the Romans or the abduction of Italians by the Moors in any way negates the observable impact of slavery on the modern station of black Americans is absolutely delusional.TLDR The myth of white slavery is a latent racist canard.,nyc,ctdnu1b,2,t5_2qhu2

I just want limits on rent increases and rent in general. This isnt a bar that does no business its packed.  The rent is being jacked up so they will move out its not a case of basic economics its strongarming and IMO it should be illegal.  No new hires needed for the government.  Fucking with the property market can have really big consequences as we should have learned. Rampant speculation on commercial or residential property has similar effects. And it repeats back to gold rush days. In residential areas you end up with Detroits abandoned homes falling apart after the speculation miners came in and stripped the land for all it was worth leaving dummies with worthless land claims that bankrupted them.  In commercial areas like this an area becomes trendy the speculation miners come in then maybe a few celebrities the it people.  The speculation miners get their money out of everyone as rent which is passed down to consumers.  Then the area starts to stop being trendy the miners sell their land business dries up but the new ownersaka suckers cant afford to lower rent because mortgages.  Businesses close properties abandoned go bankrupt and the taxpayer eats it as the bank writes it off.  Now this area is run down again.If were going to allow strongarming a business out of its location because of an area being trendy then we should at least have the landlord have to buy them out IF IF they pull that super rent hike bullshit.  Cash them out is all I ask.  They sat at the table they played the game fair put in the hours helping make that neighborhood trendy enough for these landlords they helped make the market value rent possible in the first place so cash them out.

Your ancestors probably came here during that time. If they came now they would be illegal immigrants. The entire situation is ridiculous.I say the more the merrier. People dont just move out of their home country for fun. People are leaving Mexico and other places because of drug wars which are fought using American weapons over American customers. This is entirely a problem we created for Latin America with our strict drug laws and lax gun laws. And then when people try to escape the violence that we created by coming into our country we persecute them are generally racist and deport them. Its totally fucked.Due to NAFTA boxes of stuff can freely cross the border. But not people. Isnt that fucked up? How can free trade help an economy but not a free labor market? Does that make any sense?I say if you and your family are trying to escape violence at the hands of the Sinaloa Cartel then welcome to fucking America zero questions asked.

They were built extremely well and are classic examples of high quality American engineering and manufacturing. The frames on these cars are still in great condition and with proper maintenance the cars can roll on for over a decade or two.The MTA should follow in PATCOs footsteps and gut the Rs out and put in modern mechanicals and electricals. No reason to spend billions in taxpayer money for brand new cars when these cars are in perfect shape structurally. Use the surplus to pay for other improvements.Next time you see an R car These run on the A and R lines notice the ripples in the metal skin of the cars. Thats where the structural members have rusted and the weight of the roof is transferred to the skin of the car. The Rs do not have this issue.

Maybe its true maybe he is oblivious to the implications of what he did. If Nazi skinheads had done it I dont think any reasonable person here would have an issue with calling it a hate crime. So its important to everyones rights and protection to categorize this correctly. Deterring hate crimes against all persons and races and religions is the goal we must aim for and if we allow this instance to go unrecognized because of some extenuating circumstance the kid is just dumb not a Nazi in this case it can reduce the effectiveness of all hate crime laws.

What the plan is doing is just incentivizing developers to build low income units but the buildings theyre putting up are usually not contextual with the neighborhoods and from a design standpoint the ugliest pieces of shit buildings. Also theyve been a little to generous with zoning in certain places and conservative in others.For example Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn is a commercial street with three to fourstory brownstones and other small buildings. Theyre planning to upzone the area so developers will be able to build up to  stories or  if they include affordable housing. Whats going to happen to Myrtle avenue in  years? Will it be all ugly condos with some affordable housing mixed in? And really why is that necessary? Theres a point where we have to say look were literally the densest city in the United States does it make sense to just put  more people here into an overburdened school system and transportation system and hope it works out?

Mutual extortion. I hope feds have their eyes on these folks. The best choice will be to overhaul the whole dept. Redo the structure from end to end.

6335320,0,t1_cz9pol8,Bloomberg gets credit for these as they were under his administration. Same way you are blaming him for polices policies you havent actually named that happened under his administration. A good example is Fulton street which was a massive hand out to Goldman Sachs et al. in many ways. It was also a massive hand out to Unions as every infrastructure project is. In addition Amanda Burden who was a Bloomberg appointment charged with much of the redesign of city planning was responsible for much of Brooklyn Bridge Park. So yes he gets credit.Bloomberg isnt corrupt for subverting the laws of the city to run for a third term. That isnt what corruption is. First of all he didnt break any laws. Do I like the moral precedent of a third term beyond limits no. Do I think that should have been allowed no. However it isnt corruption the dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power typically involving bribery. It wasnt fraud. It was voted on in city council. Either way this isnt plutocratic and again Bloomberg has never been stuck with handing out millions or billions to his buddies which was the point of the platitude uttered. Making himself and his friends richer. The amount of scandals under Bloomberg were tiny by this cities standards.In fact Bloomberg made himself poorer to help those in need through his Bloomberg foundationIn addition under Bloomberg taxes were raised to cover a budgetary shortfall but only on the wealthiestpage .Bloombergs stance on immigration is to provide them all with ID something that would improve their working bargaining power and diminish  the ability for businesses to under pay them due to legal status.What were Bloombergs environmental policies? Stringent something that cost companies here millions particularly on new buildings. Did Bloomberg give big tax breaks for corporations to move hqs here? Yes it was part of his economic policy. A faulty one in my opinion.Was Bloombergs police departments handling of OWS tone death and perhaps illegal. Yes.Was Bloombergs stop and frisk policy have impacts on people that were both likely unconstitutional and police harassment yes.There are things to actually debate and some to crucify Bloomberg for. Rather than platitudes and ignoring any good thing he did or having no nuance to anything. ,nyc,cz9r8gu,11,t5_2qhu2

You know they wont let you in if you try to merge into their lane so you almost have to cut in front of people to get in.

The nds opinion was that the searches themselves were constitutional there exists a special need.

Furthermore because I had entered the station after having been told not to I was also being charged with disobeying a lawful order.  He further stated that both charges are violations lesser than misdemeanors.This raises some important questions at least.The same person has another anecdote where they reentered without arrest.Whats the logical extension of the argument?

6438303,1,t1_czl8hmi,What people who say this sarcastic remark dont understand is just how many people really do hate israel primarily because its Jewish and how many other people hate Israel because of lies initially spread by people who hate Jews without realizing their views are based on lies. Yes its possible to disagree with the israeli government in a reasonable way but its a fine line that many people walk without considering how and why they came to those conclusions. The way I feel about israel is the way I felt about the Bush administration. I hate every decision they make... but I dont think Israel should stop existing and i dont blame the entire country or its people for the actions of their government because I know that government is rarely a representation of what the people actually want. And that couldnt be more true in Israel where their coalition government allows minority groups  like the ultra orthodox to hold way more power than their numbers. ,nyc,czl9c59,10,t5_2qhu2

Whether they realize those things are based in anti semetism or not is a different story... but to me if you believe something without understanding where those beliefs originated then thats not good. gt. If Israel was more responsible and didnt take away the basic human rights of its neighbors maybe people wouldnt hate jews indiscriminately.See right there. Right fucking there. That is anti semetism. Not to mention you just being an asshole. Israel does not represent all Jews its not the Jewish vatican so first if you dislike israel thats not an excuse to have ANY opinion about Jews as a whole. Not all Jews support israel. ANd Israel and its government does not speak for all Jews.Which human rights do you claim israel has taken away specifically? Nah actually dont answer. This debate isnt worth my time. Your last sentence proved youre exactly the type of person I was talking about. Someone who doesnt even realize that many aspects of their own views on israel are based on conscious or subconscious anti semetism.

Im not convinced airBnB is really hurting rental prices just yetthe  so a bit dated report puts the total number of NYC AirBnB units at around k with the majority being someones fulltime home but I do think the city should start cracking down before it gets worse.

8019498,0,t1_d4h8rjd,Felicia stated in the video that while she was in the shelter the father of her first child showed up and caused a big scene.  The shelter called ACS.ACS demanded at that point that the child be turned over to someone else  because even though it was the father causing the trouble ACS punished both of them by denying her custody of her child too.Once you are denied custody of one child they wont let you have custody of any others unless you jump through a lot of flaming bureaucratic hoops which is what we see in that video.  She apparently didnt jump through those hoops well enough when the second child was born which would be why the second child was taken away too.If the father of the third child doesnt jump through those bureaucratic hoops with her then they will use that as the excuse to deny her custody of that third child because hes in the house.  So in all likelihood she has already lost that third child by now because He doesnt do judges and stuff.  Hes been locked up too many times.ACS here in NYC is a really horrible agency.  They have been sued repeatedly for letting children die in situations that were so blatantly horrible than anyone should have known the children were in danger if they spend even a few moments bothering to look around in the home or bothered to talk to the children without the fosterparents present.  After having so many public scandals on the front pages of all the local papers having their reputation destroyed with the mayor swearing that the agency was going to be reorganized again and fixed ACS is now just a permanently broken agency that takes the children out of a home for the slightest hint of a reason.  But unfortunately this means they take children out of homes of a lot of poor and minority families.  In a family struggling with poverty or a family with even one person with a criminal record any social worker can come up with an easy excuse to take a child.  Then make those poor and minority people fight with resources they dont have to get their kids back.  Now though there is a presumption of a guilt instead of a presumption of innocence because the children have already been taken away.Everything about the way ACS works really sucks and it all really comes back to not enough social workers not enough resources a system that prioritizes avoiding scandal instead of protecting kids being judgemental about poverty and the effects of living in poverty and confusing it with bad parenting.,nyc,d4hgt2j,8,t5_2qhu2

8038774,0,t1_d4jlyxo,Affordability and community as well as a local culture that resonates more with me. The first one is somewhat obvious as unless youre talking about SF or something most other cities are more affordable than here but the way that your life changes when youre paying  a month to split a bedroom with your SO vs  is pretty profound. Some of that gets eaten up by potentially needing a car depending on where you work but even then my financial situation was a lot better there. In general I felt like the sense of community in MinneapolisSaint Paul was much stronger than hereI think its a combination of northern European cultural influences and perennial harsh winters that make most of the population home boundneeding to get pushed out of a snowbank but whatever it is you feel a lot more connected to your neighborhood and your state. Gentrification is eating away at this as Minneapolis appears on more and more BEST UP AND COMING CITY! lists but its definitely still present. The culture angle is very subjective but theres a strong and relatively unprententious focus on alcohol food local music art and the literary scene. Although there are fewer discrete events for each of these categories than NYC due to the smaller size of the metro area the events available tended to better put together more physically and financially accessible and tapped into the aforementioned community spirit in a much more meaningful way. The MSP metro area in general has been gentrifying over the last several years and theres definitely a lot of hipster elitism like youre likely to find in any cultural hub. Because most of the time I lived there I was in undergrad and following that I was a bartender at a comedy theater it was relatively easy for me to be cool enough to slip into a lot of these scenes than it might be if youre part of the older set. That being said its important to realize that the Minnesota Nice thing is more complicated than people tend to realize.People totally unfamiliar with the term often assume it means it refers to a bunch of overly friendly country bumpkins what its most often referring to is a sort of hollow pleasantness that is used as a prophylactic against meaningful relationships and honest social interaction but what belies the negativity of this commonly accepted definition is the fact that most of these interactions either strengthen the general sense of community greeting people on the streetbike pathwhatever within a pretty large radius of where you live or give you basic information about the people at the showbarother cultural event youre at that if you put in the effort can be used to establish real relationships that replace the superficial ones that are so easy to strike up but difficult to transcend. ,nyc,d4jmtew,1,t5_2qhu2

NYC doesnt have the will to do it possibly because of the network effect until the system becomes good enough not enough people will use it and it will remain relatively unsafe until then.

9583015,1,t1_d9uacv3,Just wait. He is going to do things to appease people.Right after Bush got elected . I was working with mostly middle class black people who were mostly living paycheck to paycheck because they bought nice cars and never brown bagged lunch of course white people do this too.They thought the election was stolen.Bush did a thing where he gave a tax rebate to everyone. Made a formula and mailed out checks in March or so . I personally thought this was stupid. The cost of administering that was likely millions. Bush could have just had a surplus then make some sort of deduction for the next year.My theory is he knew most people in the US have a negative net worth. They need the cash yesterday.So everyone got a check of a couple hundred dollars that first year.Bush went to a black church one random Sunday.He flew in to Afghanistan secretly to personally serve Thanksgiving dinner to enlisted men who are mostly black guys.The thing is Trump being President LOSES him money. This is just for ego and legacy good or bad.He is not accepting the salary.Clinton would have been the first womanyadda yadda and be paid to speak until her last waking breathe over her experiences.But she probably still will be regardless.,nyc,d9uavvx,0,t5_2qhu2
9584194,0,t1_d9uf334,They werent just mean about a candidate via email. They were using DNC resources and funding to produce antiSanders reports to spread to the media for Hillarys campaign. They channeled funds from the DNC meant for down ballot dems into Hillarys campaign. They gave her debate questions in advance of the primary debates. That is undermining democracy. The DNC charter and bylaws state that the DNC Chairperson shall be impartial and show fair treatment to all candidates. That was broken... twice! Telling Russia we are going to enforce a No Fly Zone in Syria despite the fact that even our trained military experts were saying this would result in War with not only Russia but most likely Syria as well IS threatening war. Everyone else running for president thought a No Fly Zone in Syria would cost thousands of Syrian lives and start an international conflict. Only Hillary pushed for it despite these warnings because her big donors make money when we go to war.And the electoral system works to give power to the whole country. If we didnt have it in place candidates would just appeal to California and NYC to get the most votes and the issues and opinions of states in the midwest and middle of the country would be large ignored which is right. Just because we live in NYC doesnt mean our opinions are MORE valid than someone living in Idaho. We face different issues and have different concerns. Im not happy with Trump either but thats the system. If you dont like it work to change it and find a system that works fairly for everyone. I recommend you inform yourself on WHY the electoral college was established in the first place before making comments about it.And I do believe an opinion is valid by its existence. That is part of what makes this country great. The freedom to believe and think anything you choose. If someone feels a certain way about something even if I STRONGLY disagree with it and even if they are completely WRONG on the facts they used to form that opinion its still a valid opinion to them.

Many if not all elected officials have found that they cant achieve what they wanted to do because there isnt enough support or its logistically too difficult. But I dont think Ive ever heard of one that immediately disavows his entire platform before hes even started.And on deportations there arent two million unauthorized immigrants in the US with criminal records link And Joe Arpaio of the Arizona Show Me Your Papers law is on Trumps short list for running Homeland Security. Congress the executive branch and the Supreme Court are controlled by people who think that local law enforcement should demand proof of citizenship or legal residence during any encounter. Theres no way to stop them if they decide to pass legislation that would demand that from local law enforcement all over the country. I dont see why they wont try to pass such a law  they got elected to take a hard line on illegal immigrants. Most people in the US believe illegal immigrants are here raping and pillaging they dont even question that  million number. Neither the President or members of Congress would lose support by requiring local law enforcement to demand papers. They just won control of the entire US government by promising mass deportations of every single unauthorized immigrant in the country regardless of their situation it would probably make them more popular. ,nyc,da1v9i9,1,t5_2qhu2

Some  of new real estate purchases are done by foreign entities who A dont even live in New York and B arent people but investment firms.Huge swaths of properties are being purchased by ibanks because real estate in NY SF London Vancouver and many other such cities are now much more profitable than other investments such as the stock market. Real estate is essentially being used as bank accounts that gain huge profits. Banks due to the legalization of using depositors money for banks to speculate with which caused the  crash if you recall are parking money in real estate eating away huge chunks of supply. This is on an international level. They sometimes come in and buy up entire sections of neighborhoods. They bribe local community boards to change zoning in their favor to build new developments specifically for flipping to gain huge profits. To add insult to injury developers are getting huge tax breaks from New Yorkers to subsidize the big banks making huge profits off of these investments.Notice when housing started to get really expensive in New York the late searly s. Thats exactly when this type of speculation became legal.So its the investment banks fault for buying up tons of properties to sit empty. And its politicians fault for letting banks do this with depositors money.

No matter what your stance is it should be reasonable to understand that it is a tragedy of the commons that mentally ill homeless live on public transportation. Im deeply sympathetic to wanting to remove them  the question is how? And on what grounds? And then do what with them? Its a tragedy that they are homeless in the first place and a collective failure of our whole society  but this aside that horse is out of the barn and surely there must be a solution that is better than just having literally hundreds of homeless people roaming our subways every day. I understand that shelters are awful  I support paying higher taxes to pay for them and to pay for better mental health services. I do not however need to be told I am not somehow a liberal or a progressive for agreeing  even with conservatives  that the legions of aggressive filthy mentally ill homeless people in our public transportation infrastructure is anything but an unacceptable crisis. ,nyc,dbakdsr,8,t5_2qhu2

There are national industry working groups who tackle this challenge every day. This exists for most materials and most major producers contribute to these groups.  I personally find the collaboration pretty inspiringExample PampG and coca cola amongst others are major players in plastics recycling working groups. Why? They have an interest in purchasing and using more recycled plastic but it isnt readily available for them since our rate of recycling is so low. So they work to improve this by making products more recyclable. It works from both ends as they adapt materials to be recyclable municipalities adapt processing practices to match the materials being produced. Municipalities do this either through investments in infrastructure to accept and process these materials more expensive up front but creates revenue on the back end or through contracts with private vendors to accept and process waste according to a set of standards outlined in an RFP less expensive up front less opportunity for profit but possibility for profitsharing agreements. We see this happening now with electronics paint food waste and other materials. This is of course in addition to traditional recyclables like metal glass plastic amp papercardboard.

10437817,0,t1_dcr686f,Hey thanks a lot for responding with your views which are totally valid and which I disagree with I think our fundamental difference is believing that talking about something is the same as encouraging it. For example that talking about sex leads to more sex talking about drugs leads to more drug use etc. Talking about this stuff does not mean encouraging it. I know I got in trouble when my parents caught me smoking pot. They would just try to tell me the truth the best they could which wasnt promarijuana it was that it was terrible for a developing brain and that I could be fucking myself over. And that I was grounded lol. And you seem to assume that discouraging kids from doing something will... lead to them doing it less. Which I think you know is the opposite frequently I dont care how good or bad a kid you are this usually comes out in one way or another you want to try the things your elders have forbidden or discouraged.Heres a study showing that abstinencebased sex ed produces higher rates of teen pregnancy eg conservative sex ed doesnt work and a google search will produce similarly academic results about stuff like the DARE program.So now that weve got the fundamentals out of the way....The word feminist in the context that its on the shirt simply and literally means equal rights for men and women. If you dont think this is an issue that needs to be addressed... well it does but you are free to move on and ignore it.What I dont get is when folks are calling this disgusting and creepy.

Bloomberg spent as mayor of New York he became known for pushing farreaching health initiatives to curb smoking and change eating habits  challenging Big Tobacco big sodas and at times the will of New Yorkers.The first three years of Bill de Blasios tenure as mayor have brought a different approach.Mr. de Blasio has championed other types of public health initiatives  most notably to promote mental health  but for the most part he has not advanced Mr. Bloombergs legacy.Nowhere is that more apparent than in the citys approach to curbing tobacco use.Clearly the evidence is still there that tobacco is a big problem in New York City and its also clear there are more things we could be doing so Im at a loss to give a logical reason for why these things arent being addressed as aggressively perhaps as they were in the past said Kevin OFlaherty the director of advocacy for the Northeast region for the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids.Antitobacco advocates point to a series of potential initiatives some of them already taken in other cities that could extend New Yorks fight against tobacco use including measures to limit the number of stores where cigarettes are sold increase taxes on small cigars and other cheaper types of tobacco ban tobacco sales in pharmacies and put a brake on the proliferation of hookah bars.Continue reading the main storyRELATED COVERAGENew York City Can Enforce Salt Warnings on Menus Court Says MAY  New York City Soda Fight in Court Tests Agencys Power JUNE  Chirlane McCray Promises Millions of Dollars for Mental Health and Social Service Programs MAY  ADVERTISEMENTContinue reading the main storyThe previous administration did everything it could and unfortunately for whatever reasons were at a period right now where were leaving some opportunities on the table Mr. OFlaherty said.Instead leadership on the tobacco issue has come from the City Council where several members have proposed bills targeting tobacco use and sales.Last March the City Council passed a bill introduced by Corey Johnson a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of its health committee to ban the use of tobacco products including the smokeless tobacco popular with baseball players at ticketed sporting events. Mr. de Blasio signed the law and promised further action.We intend to put in even more measures to reduce the use of all types of tobacco Mr. de Blasio said at the time in an interview on ESPN.

It was not clear why the proposals became stalled but many former and current officials across city government complain that Mr. de Blasio can be painfully slow to make decisions.Addressing smoking and obesity are top priorities for the Health Department a spokeswoman Maibe Ponet said in a written statement that also cited the citys campaign to publicize programs to help people quit smoking. She said the department was close to announcing new tobacco reduction efforts.This is something that might sound like a long process but policy making can be long Ms. Ponet said in an interview.Mr. de Blasios health commissioner Mary T. Bassett was a deputy commissioner in the Bloomberg administration and helped fashion the citys aggressive tobacco policies.New York TodayEach morning get the latest on New York businesses arts sports dining style and more.

Advocates say that tobacco companies have long marketed aggressively in poor communities. Smoking rates in the city are much higher among adults with a high school diploma than among those who have a college degree an indication of economic status.City Councilman Brad Lander a Brooklyn Democrat has proposed a measure to bar pharmacies from selling tobacco. But other cities have gone much further to limit sales.PhotoNewport advertisements at a deli in Brooklyn. The de Blasio administration has defended the antitobacco policies of its predecessor but advocates say more could be done.

While stores that currently sell tobacco can continue to do so new sales permits will be restricted in order to reach a goal of one tobacco outlet for every  people in the citys  planning districts. The poorest districts have the highest concentration of stores about three per  people while some wealthier districts have less than one per  according to the health commissioner in Philadelphia Dr. Thomas Farley.This should be the next big area for health advocates to focus on around smoking prevention said Dr. Farley who served as a health commissioner in New York under Mr. Bloomberg.In  when Mr. Bloomberg took office . percent of adult New Yorkers smoked according to the Health Department. The number fell rapidly amid policies that increased the cost of cigarettes restricted where people could smoke and promoted programs to help people quit reaching  percent in . The rate has fluctuated since in  it was again at about  percent. Youth smoking rates in New York City have dropped from about  percent in  to about  percent in .Mr. Johnson the city councilman who sponsored the ban on all forms of tobacco in sports stadiums praised Mr. de Blasios handling of public health issues like the citys brush with Ebola and an outbreak of Legionnaires disease.But we also have to continue the incredible work that the previous administration did on antismoking measures on obesity prevention Mr. Johnson said. As the chairman of the councils health committee he said he will hold a hearing this year on a group of antismoking measures including a pharmacy sales ban and steps like those taken in Philadelphia to reduce the number of stores that sell tobacco.The de Blasio administration has gone to court to defend aspects of Mr. Bloombergs antitobacco policy most recently turning back a challenge to a rule that included electronic cigarettes in the ban on smoking in bars restaurants and other locations.And in  the city Board of Health passed a requirement that chain restaurants place warning icons next to menu items that contain elevated levels of salt  a measure aimed at reducing sodium intake which can lead to heart disease. The labeling rule recalled similar initiatives by Mr. Bloomberg.But after a state court in  knocked down a Bloombergera effort to limit the sale of extralarge sugary drinks Mr. de Blasio did not push the City Council to enact a measure that could withstand court scrutiny even though as a candidate he had supported the limit on sugary drinks.Theres no doubt those issues were a higher priority for the previous mayor Mr. Lander said. But he noted Mr. de Blasios push to increase services relating to mental health saying This administration is leading on public health issues in this case a different public health issue.,nyc,dcrt2ah,5,t5_2qhu2

10461036,1,t1_dctr2dg,gt if the left acted this way if Mitt Romney was elected  years ago it would make no sense but at least with Trump he is the candidate to start calling out racism or corruption by the Right because of everything that has happened so far involving Trump the guy is a living headline maker.Look at how the left media treated Romney though.He was a racist sexist misogynist according to the media.gt always thought reasonable conversation to understand each side had a place in politicsOh really?Really?All the usual voices did all the usual things about Republicans with a chance to win they savaged him over and over.Dont you remember that coverage?Remember the glee over Obama effectively calling Romney a fucking dumb stuck in the past moron for worrying about the size of the US Navy and our geopolitical threat from Russia?Conservatives sure did.We already know how the leftist machine operates when a milquetoast moderate who gets the nomination becomes Mormon Hitler.

The right started losing their minds right around the time conservative radio and Fox News became propaganda making shit up and misreporting in order to serve an agenda of misleading the common folk into leaving the party that best served their interests.  Things have gotten worse and worse to the point where if they dont like the facts they use alternative facts.  The GOP is now a party entirely built on lies deception hypocrisy and denial.Does Obamacare have death panels?  Is he a secret Muslim socialist from Kenya?  Is climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese?  Is Hillary connected to a secret pedophilia rung being run out of a popular pizza joint?  Was the moon landing faked?  Is the earth flat?When one party goes off the deep end the other party can be forgiven for starting to think theres a clear right side and wrong side.If youve been brainwashed your whole life to think Liberals are Bad and Liberals are Idiots no ones going to look down on you for that.  Pity maybe but not scorn.

10498127,0,t1_dcxuewt,Im actually enjoying this because Im just not quite enough of a smug cunt to get offended by someone calling me names on the internet. Instead despite all evidence to the contrary Im going to assume youre open minded enough to have a discussion.  By discussion of course I dont mean words flying back and forth  Im talking about one of those things were people can come to an understanding  but I guess I dont need to explain that to someone as well educated and intelligent as you.gt Im not name calling for the sake of name calling. Im literally highlighting the reason why the right is growing more and more powerful.All youve highlighted is how effective the right is in creating and applying labels.  How easy it is to paint everything on the left with the same broad brush and dismiss it.  How by doing so you can pretend the other argument isnt valid.  Youve done a wonderful job not actually responding to anything Ive actual said but instead calling me a smug liberal cunt and ignoring it.  This proves my point perfectly.  Given that your so wise and Im an elitist who has to explain everything to everyone in case anyone else might be reading this thats called ad hominem  a logical fallacy which does nothing to disprove my arguments.However I understand that me being correct about my points as I am doesnt actually prove you wrong.I do love how you think based on this short conversation that you know me well enough to make such an informed judgement on my character.  Not only am I a smug elitist cunt but Im not that smart and probably havent had the education you have.  Thats kind of a quick judgement no?  If you hadnt heard over and over from the right that liberals are smug elitists I kinda doubt that you would have used those words.  Personally I think Ive been less of an ass than you in this thread but then youre a liberal so you may be a smug liberal cunt as well.  Introspect a bit and tell me honestly would you have used those words if they hadnt been coming out of the right wing echo chamber for years?gt  First ya smug cunt Im a liberal... You assume because I disagree with your methods that I must be on the right.Ah ha!  The big reveal!  Youre like a magician!  You know I actually figured that was the case since you did say we lost and as someone with decidedly left liberal policies but since you were presenting the argument of a Trumper it was convenient for me to say you.  So dont be so smug you smug cunt.  You have again assumed you know what Im thinking and since youre railing against assumption it undermines your own argument.gt the inability to conceive that someone who disagrees with you on some issues may be aligned with you on othersYeah no.  I dont know how you came to that conclusion.  I did say early on that Democrats are not a monolith.  Republicans like to think that the left is all the same but theres a huge variety of views.  Im with you on immigration and trade deals and Im conflicted on globalization.  I think government can and should be smaller though I would support single payer health care.  I dont think Obama was our savior as the right likes to say or even a particularly great president.  I think his foreign policy largely sucked Im highly alarmed by his expansion of executive powers drone strikes lack of transparency and what the fuck is up with Executive Order ?  But I dont really give a shit about what people believe or their opinions on the issues.  What I do care about is ability to change your opinion in the face of facts and logic.  Dogma is bad regardless what side youre on.gt Fourth youre smug because every problem you just described about the right is one that the left suffers from too. For example global warming isnt indisputable. Its simply not. We know the earth is warming and we know that humans have contributed. Right so it is indisputable.  Its just the degree of warming thats in dispute.  The same is true about the problems of the left.  I agree that there are problems but theres a big difference in degree.  Using your example Im glad to see that the majority of Trump supporters believe the reality that climate change is happening but when only  of the GOP believe a fact theres a problem.  There are similar disappointing numbers on evolution and whether we found WMDs in Iraq and plenty more.  Find me some equally bad numbers for Democrats on an equally large range of things for which a consensus truth exists and I might accept your argument.  For now I call that a false equivalency.gt Sixth you did carefully not say the word dumb. It was adorable how you danced around it. And instead you talked of their ignorance inability to critically think and their knowledge being made of lies. Hmmm I wonder what the colloquial term is for someone who is ignorant full of lies and cant critically think ... jeeez if only we had a word for that.Except Im not talking about colloquial terms.  I carefully avoided saying dumb because its not the right term.  Ignorant doesnt mean dumb.  It means uninformed and uninformed is what I mean.  Specifically uninformed because the right have been consistently misinformed and taught to mistrust the very sources that might inform them.  And Im not talking about me.  Im not some elitist who has all the answers.  But science is pretty good and although the media is frequently wrong and fuck them for sensationalizing everything and not doing real journalism they do get it right more often than not and youd have a tough time convincing me theres some grand conspiracy to mislead.  That mistrust and misinformation leads to the kind of poll numbers in the links above which in turn leads to  of Trump supporters believing Obama is a Muslim and half believing in Pizzagate  I dont know for a fact that those isnt true but come on...gt You assume because I disagree with your methodsgt your problem  the inability to conceive that someone who disagrees with you on some issues may be aligned with you on othersgt you likely do that to folk on the right all the time expecting that youre smarter than they are just because they disagree with youAside from some pretty snarky comments towards you personally in this message you wont see anywhere that Ive actually criticized the people on the right.  Hell I even said the Nazis werent necessarily bad people.  To me the people are blameless.  My beef is with the right wing propaganda machine which I believe to be controlled by a handful of Republican elites  lets call them the   who own the vast majority of wealth and power in this country including politicians on both sides of the aisle and a number of powerful media voices and who saw that they could use their wealth and power to serve their own selfish interests.  Or maybe they really think its for the good of the country.  Who knows.  Either way its poisonous.You on the other hand are personally attacking me and talking down to me and insulting me and then accusing me of doing exactly that to everyone on the right.  Tell me you dont see the hypocrisy there.This kind of oversimplification lumping people into groups turning things into black and white thinking ignorant is too nuanced so I must really mean dumb hence Im an elitist cunt.  Because Im liberal like you I must be like all the other smug liberal elites not like you I guess?.  Thats the problem.  Thats why I defined critical thinking.  The world is a complex place with complex issues which are all a matter of degree and if people wants to just jump to one extreme or the other without doing their due diligence they are doing themselves a disservice.Please prove me wrong.  If you think the polls cant be trusted and Republicans actually have a better or equal grasp on reality compared with Democrats then prove it.  If you cant prove it then if Republicans are not just dumb and I agree with you and theyre not being misinformed by propaganda and groupthink and I disagree with you in a much more extreme way than Democrats then Id love to hear your theory.  Even better if you can back it up with evidence.EDIT mixed up my logical fallacies and removed a little of my most smuggishly cunty elitism.,nyc,dcy2ncv,2,t5_2qhu2

Because Nazis gave up on the concept of humanity and tried to obliterate groups of people off the face of the planet. They rounded up people and tortured them experimented on them worked them to death ground their faces into acid and put them in ovens. They abandoned humanity by treating humans as less than human as less than animal as less than LIVING.If there is ONE thing I thought humanity as a WHOLE could agree on by  it would be of all groups of people on this planet the simplest that deserves to be punched at any time is someone choosing to identify as a Nazi.That is someone who is C H O O S I N G to identify with a group of people that called for the systematic extermination of Jewish people black people gay people Romani people and tons of other groups. Modernday Nazis call themselves Nazis and actually say that shit still. Are you serious when you say they dont deserve to at LEAST be punched? Are you without any moral qualms that they be prioritized legally over a Jewish person that a Nazi is targeting and going out of his way to harass?This is why we have a Nazi writing speeches for the American President. This is why we have Donald Trump blithely saying America First like that wasnt a failed political tactic during World War II that called for ignoring the pleas and cries of dying human beings across the Atlantic.

Wed be a country of  million people not speaking to one another and using s technologyThe thing people are getting wrong about this is no one is suggesting the permanent ban of all immigrants.  The policy was specific and temporary while a permanent policy is created.

Unsurprisingly urban areas are also relatively disenfranchised compared to rural areas i.e. rural votes count more. But the fact of the matter is youve spamming random numbers that dont appear to be true across several subreddits. You react like a hostile child when people simply ask for your source rather like Trump actually. You are and this is the only part of your trolling that I enjoy citing fucking upvotes as proof. That part of your schtick is funny at least. And you got upvotes because you cited a statistic that urban people feel is true and want to be true and like to be angry about.

Your community was more than likely not one where stop and frisks were a way of life and over policing of low level offenses ran rampant. And that is the main difference. Communities of color have been targeted with these tactics for decades and before that were forced into areas that were deemed undesirable because of red lining. There are numerous factors that contribute to the issues in low income communities specifically those made up of people of color. Lack of access to services is one. Lack of economic development is another. Underinvestment in schools and libraries is another. Over policing is yet another. I dont think I said that poverty alone was the end all be all. These circumstances contribute to the deterioration of the community. And sure people absolutely have choices but when the confluence of factors mentioned above come together and make life more difficult for the people living in those communities they may not have many options. ,nyc,ddvan10,-3,t5_2qhu2

10903143,0,t1_de48kk5,Vermont has great pizza partly because of the NYC influence.  Culturally its more connected to NYC than northern NY is. Tons of New Yorkers moved to VT in the s and brought a lot of NYC food traditions.  Thats when good coffee arrived in VT Green Mountain Coffee Roasters was started by a NY transplant who started roasting his own because he couldnt get good shit in VT when bagels arrived literally they were not available in VT before the Burlington Bagel Bakery and though we had a large Italian community in several parts of Vermont going back to the s I suspect the Pizza tradition was heavily influenced by the s Newyorker back to the landers because the pizza culture is so explicitly based on NY pizza.Only difference is puffy crusts are a bit more popular proportionally.Really amazing pizza available even in fairly small towns across the state.

11532693,0,t1_dg1i7yu,gt  apart for no real reason    Males have very narrow pelvises because they dont need to pass a baby ever. These pelvises are also Vshaped wider at the iliac crests and narrowing at the ischial tuberosities. The pelvic arrangement for the majority of men are narrow hips with very limited mobility and very little ability to externally rotate. Men tend to be taller which means longer femurs and long femur necks which also limit mobility of the hips.    Female femurs have a tapered shape on the other hand wider at the hip joint and angling in at the knees. The sexual dimorphism of the pelvis is inarguable. Some things are simply going to be possible for the female pelvis and acetabula that are impossible or inaccessible to the male pelvis.    It comes together to make sustained sitting with the thighs even close to parallel prohibitively uncomfortable for many men. In fact depending on the pelvic construction and orthopedic history it will be beyond painful but anatomically impossible for a large percentage of men to bring the knees together and to keep the knees held there without causing lasting damage and distressing pain.,nyc,dg38e8v,-1,t5_2qhu2

11534412,0,t1_dg391lq,Electronics and Computer Networking at a joint vocational school.A lot of kids screw off at vocational schools but if you take it serious enough to get a job better than fast food youll be in a better situation. Even better is if the experience builds on your end goal. Like many of those programs do for people. So my advice to the dill holes bashing college is to get their shit in order in high school. Get work experience alongside your education and youll be better off than the dill holes that expect a great job after paying for a piece of paper. Computer Science for college major. Dont get me wrong that was a journey in itself as well. Not being familiar with college I initially went to DeVry. Quickly corrected that mistake after a semester. I dont believe you can get a valuable education from a forprofit school. Like forprofit healthcare they are anathemas to the cause. Look no further than ITT Tech for reasons to avoid forprofit education like the plague it is. Save the money go to communitystate.The take away I would say is dont look for a one and done solution. If you want medical focus on nursing and learn Latin. There are a number of vocations where the same method of advancement works in your favor. Focus on a crescendo of progress. Whatever vocationdegree always be improving and youll be better off than even some of the brightest. Ive taken risks. Thats the other thing. You cant just expect it all to fall into your lap. You have to be looking for the opportunities.If you want to get out of college in  years you need a plan. Plan your curriculum. Watch what courses are difficult to get into and when theyre offered. Get into your program and get out into the world. ,nyc,dg3fews,1,t5_2qhu2

11800426,0,t1_dgxkkqi,In several ways.Not all universities have an obligation to protect free speech on campus. Private universities do not have this obligation any more than you have an obligation to allow free speech on your front lawn.However public universities such as Berkeley do have this obligation. When speakers invited by officially sanctioned and recognized student groups are denied their right to speak by the hecklers veto free speech has not been protected. Because the University receives State and Federal funding the university has an obligation to make sure that safety is ensured for the students and the property on campus.The police university and local also have an obligation to protect people and property from violence.Berkeley has had several events where the administration and the police the government did not protect people and property from violence and destruction as a result of the invocation of the hecklers veto.That said the Berkeley police did indeed finally do their jobs and protected the most recent Berkeley free speech event. And when they showed up and did their job violent rioters such as Antifa and BAMN stayed home. Speakers were able to speak freely without violence.Some people who were against the message of the freespeech protesters also showed up to protest. It looks like productive conversation ensued with little to no violence.A step in the right direction. This is what happens when the government does its job to protect free speech.,nyc,dgxmar1,1,t5_2qhu2
