10014962,0,t1_dbcy7uw,I would say that any approach to trying to build communism based on centralised structures of power  such as there was with those examples  is doomed to fail. You have a movement for communism led from above and that leads to dictatorships. The eventual goal of communism as detailed by its earliest theorists is a world of free association and collaboration  each according to their ability and their need. A world where the energy of all is used for the good of all rather than capitalism where we have the energy of all used to benefit the few the rich the most. None of those examples got close to such a world and I would consider them very sad examples of revolutions derailed. Well I dont know much about early Yugoslavia or Cuba. But say with the Russian Revolution theres been a lot said about it losing its original principles and well Stalin was a twat. Lenin not much better.,topofreddit,dbcz85x,2,t5_2zqtn
