3487769,0,t1_cpppv52,Percy has done alright when he hasnt been injured. Hes just missed a lot of time this year. Finn probably should have spent this season dominating the ECHL instead of sitting in the press box at the MTC but hell turn out in another couple years. Well just have to be more patient with him where his footspeed and decision making both need a bit of work at the professional level. Hes a great communicator on the ice though. A great leader type player.,TorontoMarlies,cpptx7o,3,t5_37bac

3596047,0,t1_cq260hv,Yeah its nice to have a space to talk about all of our prospects and not just the top  or .Im really excited to see if Froese can keep up his pace at the start of camp next year. Or if well offer him a  way NHL contract before then.Hopefully no one else beats us to the punch on Froese because right now technically any NHL team can offer him an NHL contract.,TorontoMarlies,cq26cg3,1,t5_37bac
3664354,0,t1_cq9gqsu,I figure  of this team has a shot at making the Leafs next year and a few will its what they do with their opportunity.  Frattin is hard to wrap your head around.  I agree  he looks above AHL level but that doesnt necessarily mean NHL quality.  Biggest difference I notice between the  leagues isnt skill but D zone coverage and he needs to find a way to make space for himself in the NHL.Good to see Leipsic find his game here.  Pulled a dirty dangle yesterday and then got crushed by the other D.  Didnt phase him at all.  He has to play fearless if he wants to make it to the big show.,TorontoMarlies,cq9ylye,2,t5_37bac
3868573,0,t1_cqx9004,I almost wish they would have started Sparks. Bibeau has a bad record vs GR and Sparks just came off a great season in the ECHL where he was far and away the best goalie.,TorontoMarlies,cqx91if,2,t5_37bac

5547462,0,t3_3r461i,Is there going to be a stream? Id love to watch this game! Couple of questions  How does Keefe handle lines? Are they evenly split for ice time? I see that the fourth line is pretty stacked so I would assume so? Who is the clear cut starter? Or do they not have one? Lets Go Marlies!,TorontoMarlies,cwkpped,3,t5_37bac

5923087,0,t3_3wg1ta,I have no idea whats going on the the Marlies today. Trying to force passes on a  on .. Like.. just take the extra  seconds to get the space. Theres no way they can defend it as long as youre relatively patient. If you try and put the puck through someone you just have them going back the other way.,TorontoMarlies,cxw1qlo,1,t5_37bac
