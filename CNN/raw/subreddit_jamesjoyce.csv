3741560,0,t1_cqiq18m,Is yours  pages long? Thats the original length and it matches up with the all the supplementary texts like Annotations to Finnegans Wake. I definitely recommend getting a copy with  pages. Heres advice on getting a good hardcover edition This is the only analysis Ive written up so far. Im sure all of this is explained much better in supplementary texts. Im not reading any supplementary texts yet so this is what Im picking up on my own As he says on the first page The fall is retaled down through christian minstrelsy. So far the Fall seems to be the major theme. He frequently mentions the fall of Adam amp Eve fall from paradise Jesus Phoenix Humpty Dumpty Finnegan who fell off the ladder and died HCE a character who was seen doing something scandalous in Phoenix Park ParnellIn fact all of the above are mentioned if somewhat obliquely on the first page laying out the theme.These can be split into those who rose again  Jesus Phoenix amp Finnegan  and those who could not be put back together again  Parnell Adam amp Eve hence humanity Humpty Dumpty and HCE who is regularly confounded with Humpty Dumpty.,jamesjoyce,cqirgeg,2,t5_2sl2n

4400509,0,t3_388o0c,There is a relevant quote from the book iirc it comes later on though. If you want to read it google for cunning not pasting it here because spoilers.Also Id say that Stephen is probably not wanting to get himself into this kind of arguments but at the suggestion that Tennyson is the best he cant dodge the provocation and gets himself entangled in the discussion.,jamesjoyce,cslo72b,2,t5_2sl2n

6517581,0,t3_44tzjl,welp bear with me.  it took me a while to come to Joyce.... and Im writing this more for myself than for others so forgive the indulgence.  Its a great question and since i literally have never discussed Joyce with anyone in the real world ever this is going to be a bit of a slog perhaps.I read all the time as a kid for pleasure and to learn.  but it slowed down in high school required reading although enjoyable wasnt MY reading.then I went to college.  fulltime architecture school AND full time work.  no reading. at all. workworkworkwhile in school i turned .  my girlfriend now wife gave me a copy of Walden twovolume edition Riverside Press done under Bruce Rogers.  it struck a nerve.  i got back into reading as much as i could though school and work were a hour a day death march.i started getting postcards in the mail and catalogs from the book shop where my wife bought Walden.  it was Buddenbrooks in Boston Massachusetts.  Still there.martin was beginning to buy and sell Joyce at prices then which were crazy now which seem cheap.  i knew NOTHING about rare books nor Joyce but Martins catalog descriptions were fascinating and i was a sucker for it all.  intrigued.catalogs kept coming and more and more Joyce material appeared and was described in terms that made me realize any serious reader and I thought I was a serious reader HAD to read this book...but work and school and work and life...  and work got in the way we went to a wedding of some friends.  at their house they had a library of a few hundred or so books.  i saw Ulysses at eye level and I pulled it off the shelf.  opened it and read a little.  or tried to.i love language.  i can fauxspeak a few languages none well but enough to love them and work on pronunciation.   i love accents dialect words etymology.  i was pretty sure i was an intelligent guy. my idea of fun last year was to buy an English charter ca and teach myself to read medieval script then translate the latin.  im pretty selffrigging satisfied!  so heck I can surely read Ulysses right??!!?this thing...  Ulysses. made me realize i was pretty stupid not at all as wordly or wordly as i estimated.  what in the HELL was this about? its not comforting to read a sentence in English and realize you knew fewer than half the words.a marginal note next to the line re stevens threadbare cuff and black clothing.  scribbled earnestly in some required college class why is steven wearing black?i had no idea either.  but shit.  i knew that there were people who knew and i was missing not just the words but the whole damn thing itself.then i graduated.  time.  i had TIME.  i just finished a year long thesis.  i was wipred.so off to a childhood family vacation spot with my girlfriend.  one of the first things i did to get ready was go to Waterstones and buy the Gabler edition of Ulysses how the HELL can they have fixed seven errors per page?!?!?!and then to vermont.  sunny green no deadlines and a first foray back into reading something i had done easily and voraciously since i can first remember.  dictionaries encyclopedias ANYTHING.  all was good all was fun i learned something from everything.i opened Ulysses sitting out in the sun with my feet on a rail.  aaaaaaahand then started reading Stately Plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl on which a mirror and razor lay crossed...what?read it again  here we go.  ahem.  aaaaaand go.and basically ran into the biggest bookrelated wall i ever ran into.  cold sweats.  have i forgotten how to do this?no.  just out of practice and over my head.but it was intriguing.  i never once assumed that Joyce was an asshole trying to be inventive and that the problem was his not mine.  i never once guessed that gee perhaps this is an injoke and all this talk about how great U is is bullshit designed to keep a miniindustry of insiders going.i didnt quickly come to the conclusion that i was wasting my time and that Joyce was just trying to be obscure.i realized  I didnt know shit that I wasnt as wellread as I thought that I was the problem not Joyce.  but i knew too there was something there there.  and so i flipped through.  i read here and there.  put it down read Portrait read Gifford read Dubliners went back to U etc. etc.and it started to come together.  i could see that behind the already intriguing language and beauty of just the text itself objective beauty just as a string of words that behind that there was a mythic story.  Everyman no man etc.I started reading that book as Stephen young brash midtwenties precocious.  and I like Stephen  thought I was a smart sunnuvabitch.  Wordly. Learned.  Now twenty years later? married with kids a house describe it a small cottage near rail service and city tramway and proximate to the primary and secondary turnpikes featuring three bedrooms twopipe steam heat best materials viz horsehair plaster over scratch coat on split lath gumwood trim since painted oak flooring twoinch wide throughout built in book shelving and corner dining cabinet etc. single bath with indoor bestKohler watercloset tiled roof white painted cedar clapboard oldgrowth served by a  water main city sewer natural gas line and associated gas range reliable municipal electric service metered downspouts tied to perimeter drainage system terminating in a discreet outlet in stone wall at curbside regular delivery by  am of the latest news city and local weather station of anemometer barometer rain gauge and hygrometer etc. kitchen with true Lino floor mosaic inset handcut with border porch overlooking a quiet street of similar scaled and spaced cottages situated due northsouth on a small rise on the slope of a small hill result of Laurentide glaciation and subsequent erosion... well Im more like Bloom.  older maybe wiser more patient and yet more impatient.it took twenty years to find Joyce and twenty years to fully appreciate it. i read it on and off about every summer or soEDIT some links,jamesjoyce,cztgvn4,4,t5_2sl2n
