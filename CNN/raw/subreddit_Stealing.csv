Wear a hat. Wear gloves but not leather. Dont put socks on your shoes thats stupid just wear gummy soles like on samba Adidas. Try to steal a book bag from the home so you arent carrying one there. Bonus points burn the clothes and shoes after have a big beard and shave after. Sell your shit out of state. Most people arent this careful but a lot of people get caught. If you are caught by people in the house the best cover is a confused friend. Omg Im so sorry I thought I was in so and sos house as you hastily walk to the door and leave. ,Stealing,ddspz60,8,t5_2vzib

10978641,0,t3_5wp105,Just keep in mind body language is a dead give away. At this point I assume youre not acting nervously. Just make sure that your never actually look up at the camera to check on it anytime near the activity.True an accomplice would def help. This is the best sub Ive seen so far lol. Just keep that body language natural and come up with a grand excuse for any questions that may be answered. Negligence is not the best way to go. If anything. You were actually buying them yourself during your hours because you didnt have time after or something. Youd know more about an appropriate and acceptable excuse per your situation. But def keep us posted.,Stealing,decea5j,1,t5_2vzib

11147353,0,t1_dev4h23,Thanks for the response.  Got some good ideas there. Where do you normally lift the video games? Im too paranoid to hit Target or best buy. Walmart keeps them locked up and GameStop keeps them behind the counter and only had empty cases out on display,Stealing,devjgzy,1,t5_2vzib
