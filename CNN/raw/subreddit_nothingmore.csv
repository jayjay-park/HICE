I joined the military straight out of high school and was deployed to Iraq a few years later. I had really started enjoying life but it eventually faded away as the years passed. I now suffer from PTSD and depression and have thought many times that life is just too hard. My amazing family and friends keep me going every day. I couldnt do it without them.
