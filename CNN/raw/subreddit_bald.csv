3781131,0,t3_33pmuu,Dont worry about looks.  Some girls care about looks some dont.  Im not very attractive and not been at all successful with girls and Ive just started to date a girl.  One thing she seems to like about me is the conversation I can make her laugh very easily. What I have learnt over the past  years since being  and in a similar situation to you.  Looks dont matter people might not make an effort to talk to you or they might be give a cold reception when you first meet them.  But make an effort to talk to them and practise conversation with new people and soon enough people wont care what you look like because you will be making them laugh and telling them interesting stories.  I really think conversation skills are in everybody its just takes confidence and practice.Make yourself interesting get hobbies and most importantly meet new people as often as possible.  A great website is meetup.com I met the girl I am now dating at one of the socals there.Also stress apparently speeds up the balding sods law heh.

5863882,0,t3_3u8l6n,Ive completely shaved my head for years and women usually love it. They usually want to give the old dome a rub with and Im always okay with. As with most things with dating just be confident and let your personality shine. Of course hitting the gym always helps. Ladies tend to love fit men especially when its along with rocking a shaved head. Some sort of facial hair also tends to help but every woman has their own preferences so just dont give up hope and youll find what youre looking for in time.,bald,cxoaa89,1,t5_2sfez
5909875,0,t1_cxtt1ek,Sure! Theres a couple of reasons. Keeping it classy. We should all aspire to present ourselves as clean welldressed individuals to emphasize that being bald is not negatively impacting our selfesteem. . Promoting better photo quality. As Im sure youre aware the quality of selfieshots varies wildly. The nature of this sub pretty much demands selfies for the sake of discussion. By requiring clothing my hope is people will be more conscientious about the photos they post here and in so doing improve the general quality of the sub.. No sexgender bias or discomfort. The sub is clearly dominated by male subscribers however I want to encourage this community to embrace ALL bald people. Women can be bald too. I wouldnt want women to feel unwelcome hear either because of all the male shirtless pictures OR alternatively if they were on the receiving end of unwanted attention for posting a picture that led offtopic no longer discussing baldness.. Generally staying ontopic. Tattoos and other personal bodymods that might be revealed by a lack of clothing are personal choices that can divide opinion and lead to discussions better facilitated elsewhere. Shirtless pictures are appropriate in discussions of fitness  which we may get into from time to time but thats not the focus here.,bald,cxubftt,1,t5_2sfez

Itll happen soon and probably multiple times. ,bald,czsvv17,1,t5_2sfez
6513458,0,t3_44ubar,Scalp micropigmentation is a tattoo.  Plain and simple.  Its drawing hair on your head. And in fairness the results can look amazing. My concern is over time what if your hairline continues to move?  Or what if one day you just WANT to shave? Youll have scalp tattoos. There are reality TV shows about stuff like that...Tattoo Nightmares is a personal favorite. As for your hair and scalp I think you look quite good with a buzz cut.  It suits you.  But you also look okay with the undercut...more skilled blending at the transition would make it feel like a more upscale haircut though. As for options you have them all.  Heres the thing.  You said it yourself youve Been losing hair since I was  and I think I was destined or something. My forehead is huge. Im tired of hair loss holding me back. Seriously read that part I quoted. You already said its falling out.  What difference does your head shape make at that point?  Its not like its going to remain your choice forever.  Though see the analysis done by uMattpilf who points out correctly that you are aesthetically balanced It honestly sounds like you WANT to get rid of it but fear is holding you back.  And youve found excuse after excuse to NOT do it. So let me suggest this.  Find an excuse to shave.  Lots of guys need an excuse to do something to muster the courage to save face or whatever.  Losing a bet on the Superbowl would be a good one hint hint. My own was shaving in solidarity with my best friend when he reached his  month chemo treatment. As for paleness...its skin.  Its going to be pale.  If it bothers you tan it artificially.  Id suggest a self tanner cream not a tanning booth but whatever works for you.  Im letting mine tan naturally a few hours a week.  Many suggest an increasingly short buzz cut over the span of a month or two to let your scalp catch up gradually. Bear in mind losing a bet is supposed to leave you looking awkward for a short while and the paleness could be explained away like that.  Just wear a hat or a bandana for a while. Consider the options weve mentioned.  Make your own decision.  But rest assured that buzzed looks great on you and shiny bald would probably look even better. There is no substitute for shiny bald.,bald,czt1jap,2,t5_2sfez

6858972,0,t3_49o8n6,Indeed. I shaved it my last year of college and one of the faculty members a woman many years older than me think grandma repeatedly told me every day that I shouldnt have done it. It got so bad that I had to tell her to cut it out. I almost had to take it up with the HR of the college and it wouldnt have been her first offense either. Imagine if a male faculty member had been making that many statements about a female students appearance.

Ive seen guys use the barbers trick of using a washcloth or small towel soaked in hot water and wrapping that around the head for a few minutes before you shaving in order to soften the hairs and then using just warm water after that.  Also a rinse with cold water once youve finished everything can help.    Id avoid shampooing everyday.  Theres no real need.,bald,d137y2t,1,t5_2sfez

7362868,0,t3_4g6hdm,Hay man  year old here and I feel ya.Im not toe sure about those products although im sure they probably worked for some people. I also find it strange that youre hair seems to be getting light up top but your hairline isnt receding. That doesnt sound like male patterned baldness to me and could be a side effect from the antidepressants. I would recommend a buzz cut for now although your current style looks fine to me. If you want to cut it lower you can but dont shave it with a razor since that is a bit drastic especially in your case. I think youd look fine with a buzz cut or even something a little shorter than what you currently have but again you look fine right now. Just try going  number lower on the clippers to try it out. Just try going one number lower on the clippers if you wanna try out a more even look. ,bald,d2f3w0z,1,t5_2sfez

7438945,0,t1_d2nnwim,Use absolutely no pressure and always shave with a lubricant like foam or lather. Never shave skin that is unprotected. Figure out your grain direction in those two areas and shave them withthegrain first then acrossthegrain and avoid an againstthegrain pass for the time being. I have an area on the back of my head that grows sideways towards my right ear and slightly upwards.  I have to address that area separately.  Its easy no big deal but until I did that my shaves in that area were lackluster. Map it out.  And give yourself some time for your technique to improve.  You shouldnt be having irritation that takes days to heal.  Done right you shouldnt have irritation at all.  Shaving can be even should be a healthy and relaxing experience.

He seemed to be forgetting his two nephews and ME. so what he and his  brothers arent. FUCK ME he interrupted this post just walking telling me let me give you a tip. Wearing hats leads to hairloss. So you should take it off if you dont want it to get worse. FLMAO.There is no way to avoid critism. All you can control is how you react to comments. EVERYONE told me I looked better before. They have no clue I went through hell for  years testing out medication concealers WIGS only to find that I shouldve accepted it and shaved.People think that you happened to shave your head without putting any thought into and dont realise that it doesnt look right for your age... They just dont like seeing that their friendfamily member is part of the bald club. Usually because they enjoyed criticising that demographic or soemthing.point is its unavoidable.

7710589,0,t1_d3igttn,Nope.  Paradoxically a buzz cut makes your hair look thicker while minimizing the look of a receding hairline Shorter buzz cuts have a greater effect. We see it all the time.

It doesnt matter how much you try to improve in the other areas in your life nothing makes up for balding. Take it from a man who sleeps h a day the rest of the time is either working training or studying.You are fat? Go to the gym. Short? Doesnt matter if you still have a pretty face there will be always a shorter girl?. Fucked up noseteeth? Easy to fix.No young men who is bald can be happy unless hes idiot and lies to himself thats why I barely take any advice from here of those who are old already.The young ones just say own it how can anyone being bald simply own it? To me its the same as saying a kid with Down syndrome to own it.

11167778,0,t1_dexuks4,Hey mate thanks for the reply! My hairline receeded very agressively over the span of a year.

11214178,0,t3_5zyyc1,Diffuse thinning can be a sign of something else but its usually just another type of alopecia androgenetica. Its a particularly shitty form too as it robs you if your ability to rock a haircut very quickly.The good news is that diffuse thinning tends to respond very well to finasteride and minoxidil so have a go at that. If that doesnt work diffuse thinning tends to progress slowly so you can probably rock a buzz cut for many years to come.,bald,df343vy,1,t5_2sfez

11301253,0,t3_617p5s,At this stage you dont know the specifics how large or small your face is relative to your head and so forth.  At this stage youre dealing with the theoretical. If your face even needs framing and thats definitely an IF then the beard is almost always a good choice.  Have you ever grown one before?  Your specific mention of stubble troubles me youre choosing a style before knowing how it will look on you. But yes facial hair is almost always a good choice. Other techniques involve accessories like eyeglasses.  A wise choice in accessories can draw the eye to or away from any number of spots.  Pay attention not only to frame materials but bridge and arm placement as they can make a significant difference in position and effect. Other options less traditional also include tattoos piercings and other modifications.  A bridge or septum piercing for instance will definitely draw attention to the middle of your face and depending on facial structure can be a flattering choice for some.  Ear piercings even can serve the same purpose if used well. Your options are almost literally endless.  Youre limited by your creativity.,bald,dfczavn,1,t5_2sfez

11454113,0,t1_dfuabk5,Im gonna say theyre just average dudes. Half of them are older than thirty half of them are under thirty. They are in average shape not obese but certainly not cut. They are very far away from being able to run a sevenminute mile. They have zero training in martial arts or combat sports.You meet for combat in the middle of a soccer pitch. You are all unarmed. The terms of the fight are to go until submission KO or death. You are under no obligation to actually kill them although I will leave that to your discretion.Every combatant knows exactly when combat will begin at the sound of a bell. Your opponents are situated at a minimum of ten feet away from you at the sound of the bell. Should you choose you can place them closer or further away from them.You are you. No bloodlust no modifications just regular IRL Troy. You may choose to eat whatever supplements or a hearty meal before entering the battle arena should you feel this aids you. You may not however consume any performanceenhancing substances which have been banned from combat sport leagues.So Troy how many fullygrown men can you fight at one time and come out standing up?,bald,dfubd0m,3,t5_2sfez
