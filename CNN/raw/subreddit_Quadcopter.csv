Heat maybe a piece of grass flew in on the board. the Esc processing speed is particularly susceptible to small capacitance changes   water.Heat  could be the sun raised the ambient temps to F when youve flown in the shade and never seen higher than F.. Thermal Runaway can occur with marginal repeated damage. Perhaps you hit  or  peak temps and lowered the tolerance but never realized it until youre back in  performance and Poof goes the magic smoke..Always raise your voltage  I burn up fewer with S C than with S C.Run flatter bigger blades to keep the rpm up. These s are very demanding. They pull the amps like crazy and put into the air but at the cost of living on the edge..Then there is just statistics. Each ESC has  or  FETs  and heatsinks arent perfect. all it takes is one of the pack to not engage fully with the thermal transfer and Boom. avalanche failure. Why hasnt it been engineered out?

5802741,0,t1_cxgdj5w,I like the naze because it runs cleanflight well and has standard pin outs that are easy to solder.  Cleanflight is nice because its open source very popular so there are a lot of guides and info for it and most importantly it performs very well for me.  I actually run betaflight but its kinda the same thing.I had a lot of trouble getting cleanflight to run on the ccd but your mileage may vary.  It also has these tiny JST connections that are easy to break and impossible for me to repair.  So instead of just taking the old pin off and putting a new one on Im forced to replace the FC if they break.  I didnt like that.I think  is an unrealistic amount for a quality mm quad.  Its probably doable if you find the absolute cheapest parts you can but I doubt the build will last very long or perform very well.  I would go into it expecting to spend closer to  so that you can afford the cheapbutnotcheapest parts a couple batteries and enough money for a couple spares.If you can only afford  and cant save up a bit more its probably not a good hobby to get into anyway.  Dont look at it as a onetime purchase because stuff breaks and repairs can add up.Alternately if  really is all you can afford there are tons of smaller quads that wont perform like a  racer but will cost a lot less.,Quadcopter,cxgdvfh,1,t5_2tazm

5856173,0,t3_3vg0j5,I flew on an airline domestic USA with my miniquad about  months ago. I brought  lipos with me in a lipo safe bag with all the ends electrical taped so they can not short circuit. The main concern is the watt hours per battery. If your batteries are at or below  watt hours per battery you can bring in carryon an infinite number. You may only carryon two between  watt hours per battery. You are not allowed to put lipos in checked luggage it has to be with your carryon.To determine watt hours Wh multiply the volts V by the ampere hours Ah.As far as my quad itself I have a pelicantype case that fits my quad my taranis and misc accessories and props that I had with for my stowed carryon. The lipo safe bag I just put in my backpack that went under my seat. I wasnt asked a single question when going through security. Although I did see the xray dude do a double take on my quad.EDIT Also be sure to put all your batteries down to storage with your chargerbalancer before you leave this is per regulation but they will most likely never check.Source ,Quadcopter,cxn9tnq,6,t5_2tazm

8885332,0,t3_51yk6w,This looks like a cheap store bought version and unfortunately i dont believe it can be salvaged without the actual transmitter the remote control.On a good quality racing quad all you would need to do is buy a transmitter replace the receiver on the quad itself set up the flight controller with some software and boom youre good tonl fly.However i dont believe you can do much with this. I could be wrong though im fairly new to multirotors so im no expert either.,Quadcopter,d7fw3qd,2,t5_2tazm
9001603,0,t3_53ikz5,Im pretty sure BanniUK did dubai on the shrike V.  That said its a very tight build and shouldnt really be tried for your first quad.  You sort of gave options on opposite sides of the spectrum Vendettaprebuilt QAV are RTF w zero building needed and shrikeV is a minimal racing frame with no room for error.  Perhaps consider a frame with a little more space like an Alien or QAVR that you can still build yourself but will have enough room for you to figure out what youre doing.That said Id rather have that prebuilt QAV than the Vendetta if not just for the camera most everything else looks to be the same.,Quadcopter,d7tuq3c,2,t5_2tazm
9011506,0,t1_d7uqzv4,I know and youre probably right I know Ill crash it and replace parts but the more time on a more powerful machine the quicker Ill pick it up. Im willing to take the risks. That being said Ill start pulling numbers off those parts. How long have you been into this sporthobby,Quadcopter,d7v1jj5,1,t5_2tazm

9071616,0,t1_d828dqk,Start Cleanflight configurator and connect to your fc with no battery connected. Go to the motors tab and slide the switch to acknowledge your props are off take the props off!!!!Now slide he master slider all the way up. Nothing will happen because no battery. Now plug in the battery. ESCs will sing a little song with upward tones because they see full throttle and that puts them in calibration mode. After song stops slide the master throttle all the way down and wait for nd song to complete. Now your ESCs are all calibrated. ,Quadcopter,d829f1l,2,t5_2tazm
9173746,0,t3_55yop3,Hello!  welcome to quads! Unfortunately they dont recommend powering your fpv camera off a non filterd power supply off your pdb  because of power spikes and its just not good for the camera google for more info  I would suggest getting a ubec of some sorts there very cheap a  volt bec of hobby king is like  dollars  and then you can future proof your self for s!!If you have anymore questions please ask!,Quadcopter,d8eu92v,4,t5_2tazm

9764042,0,t1_dagmh09,not sure what I am getting at ? What I am getting at is that there are exactly zero requirements for the pilot of a craft under  pounds. How sure are you that they had no registration at all ? Complying with the registration requirements could be as simple as the scoring  lap counter device  that each participant has to attach to their craft  having a number belonging to the event organizer on it. ,Quadcopter,dagmvqz,1,t5_2tazm

10172279,0,t3_5lmm63,Yeah more batteries for more flight time. Idont remember the model i had but i did a range mod on mine just need a wireless router antenna. I would go with a lost alarm cheap easy to wire up and work great as long as you are within ear shot.,Quadcopter,dbx312n,1,t5_2tazm

10573648,0,t1_dd6kkfw,Pretty sure regular thread is CW i.e. the same as a nut youd buy from Bunnings rightytighty leftyloosey ... hehe.  If youre worried about motor direction  dont be.  You can change the direction in the BLheli software if you dont want to bother with swapping motor wires theyre phase motors so swapping  wires will reverse the motor direction.  Its just the threads that are a pain in ass.Opinion note re the batteries  lots of people have no issues with the Turnigy Graphene batteries but I ordered  and  have died already theyre . months old.  Personally Im a big fan of the Team Orion mAh S C batteries.  Ive also got  of those and theyve been absolutely faultless since day .Edit This is a good read re Australian UAVdrone laws  they changed back in September .,Quadcopter,dd6l7rv,2,t5_2tazm

11785433,0,t3_66tilx,What exactly do you mean you lose signal? you get very staticy video for  seconds and then it completely goes out? or do you just get a black screen? Do you experience any loss of power throughout your flight compared to when you take off?,Quadcopter,dgvx1w8,1,t5_2tazm
