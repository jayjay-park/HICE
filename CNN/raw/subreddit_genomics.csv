683031,0,t3_21yprt,Galaxy is free. Im not sure if it does all that you need it to do. But for sequence editing yes.Also EMBOSS has some good bioinformatics packages.,genomics,cghwtzb,4,t5_2qmh4
4433440,0,t3_3breqo,I want to point out that the answers given here are somewhat simplistic. For example with Illumina reads you rarely actually use the full read length to assemble. You break it down into kmers fragments of length k that are smaller than the read length in order to create a de Bruijn graph or more likely the assembler you choose does that in the background. This has the advantage of being computationally cheaper and allowing for some error correction lowfrequency kmers are likely to be sequencing errors.What the answers here describe it is more like whats done with long reads Sanger Pacbio Oxford Nanopore which can use either an overlap layout consensus OLC or string graph based algorithm. Then theres the whole issue of pairedend sequencing and the information that is gained there.Since this is your introduction to the topic its fine to think of it the way that DroDro for example described. I dont mean to insult the other answers. I only mention what I do to give you a starting point for further study and to encourage you to understood at a deep level the tools that you choose to use.That said if the answer you needed is that de novo assembly is the process of using read data only to try to create a representation of an organisms genome then Ive gone way too far.,genomics,cspiu5q,1,t5_2qmh4
7258552,0,t1_d238h95,gt There really arent any filters when it comes to basecall quality scores. A quality score in this context is simply a prediction of substitution error rate and a prediction of substitution error rate is generated for every basecall. I provided a couple of links to the Illumnia website where reference was made to training filters.That was what I was referring to. Looking at the situation by just googling around I found reference to PHRED vs AI solutions for doing the same thing. I have no idea what is being used here and I thought the secret sauce label implied that noone else does either.However reference to training filters implies that trainable AI is being used in at least some places in Illumina products and services. Im only familiar with connectionist neural network trainable AI. There may be other strategies that are trainable these days of course.,genomics,d238v3m,1,t5_2qmh4
8383537,0,t3_4ufkod,I wouldnt say there are canonical papers since research is ongoing but there are big names to keep an eye on. For autism genomics I can think of Matthew State Daniel Geschwind and Evan Eichler off the top of my head. Im probably forgetting others but hopefully theyre not offended. ,genomics,d5phnzh,3,t5_2qmh4
