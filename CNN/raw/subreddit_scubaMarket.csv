7145330,0,t1_d1qc5pn,They are galvanized steel tanks. Special Permit E Made by Pressed Steel Tank PST. No longer being produced but still very good tanks.   The diameter is .The Manifold is made by Sherwood Genesis.  It uses  UNF threads which are no longer used anymore.  It is  bar manifold. Do you have a typo in your height? If they are . inches tall then they are PST HP. PST HPs are . tall and PST HPs are . tall.For that selling price theyre honestly a steal.  There is a slight gamble of them failing hydro that the buyer would take but honesty the risk is low.  I would just make the person aware that those tanks have a special hydro procedure that must be followed by the hydro facility. If your buyer falls through I am interested.  Id just have to figure out getting them from NJ to BOS Most will know it but it doesnt hurt to have them print out procedures and tape them to tanks. ,scubaMarket,d1qckhn,1,t5_2xz1z
