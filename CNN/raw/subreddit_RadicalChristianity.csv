369270,0,t1_cfiy891,No apologies necessary. Its a good reply though you may have mischaracterized my argument a bit. For examplegtIts not always a given that strong in the sense of weak vs. strong equates to fit in the sense of fitness relative to natural selection. Thats the biological aspect here. Next its also not necessarily clear that you should interpret weak in Pauls argument here as always referring to physical weakness on an individual level.I made neither of those claims. Although I suppose I can see why you inferred that because I wasnt heavy on specifics. I agree that its not always a given or necessarily clear that the strong equates to fit or that weak equates to unfit. Though it is I think a reasonable generalization. Its a common strategy in any argument to highlight the exceptions the fringe cases. But in natural selection yes the physically weak tend to be the unfit and the physically strong tend to be the fit. Human beings are one of the exceptions. A weak human being has a much fairer chance of survival and reproduction than a weak lion or a weak lamb for that matter. But that of course is my point. We are an exception and Ill show below why this should be interpreted as a revolt against biological evolution.gtOne could suggest this weak vs. strong refers to power and power classes and other or even multiple aspects may apply.Certainly Pauls conceptions of weak and strong and flesh and spirit encompass more than physicality and I dont want to diminish that or make it seem onedimensional. But there is in terms of behavior some rather unsurprising results of embracing Jesus and Pauls strategies of weakness. It is the behaviors Im interested in and the long term consequences of those behaviors upon human values and social structures and political institutions. gtAnd on your point of the family... That Jesus wanted us to love our families less than God is in keeping with my broader argument. Although where we differ is whether he meant for us to actively dissociate ourselves from our families. And by that I dont necessarily mean physical separation. I mean more importantly refusing to identify with our physical family as separate from our spiritual family. Jesus says call no man your father on earth for you have one Father who is in heaven. Matt  Ive explored this at length here where I interpret Jesus use of the word hate in Luke  as pertaining to the ancient rabbinical concept of causeless hated or sinat chinam.gtArguing that religion and culture somehow affects natural selection would require specification a mechanism.The following is from a paper I highly recommend titled The Empire of God amp EvolutiongtIn a large meta study involving  samples from  sources Vegard Skirbekk  has shown that worldwide the fertility of high status individuals has been declining at least since  C.E. the earliest information in his data set. High status was measured by wealth occupation social class and education. This shift to relatively low fertility among the wealthy accelerated in the late th century and continues today. This demographic transition has been a puzzle for evolutionists because it is counterintuitive  why would people voluntarily limit their fertility when they have the resources to produce more children and expand their genome Mulder ?There have been many cultural explanations for this demographic transition but evolutionary explanations have been elusive. And as we might expect from this developed Western and Westernized nations are seeing steadily declining birthrates. Not a coincidence. As for the mechanism I would argue with Heisman that much of this can be explained by the way in which Christianity attacked both the importance of kinship relations and also by inverting traditional pagan warrior values. The result was that Christianity compromised the ancient household economy laying the cultural groundwork for Western individualism and thereby accelerating the emergence of capitalism. In short behaviors which had once been devoted to maintaining kinship structures were replaced by behaviors which advance economic development. There seems to be an inverse relationship in modern societies between greater economic activity and declining biological fecundity. Again I dont think this is a coincidence. Christianity has been a dominant though not exclusive player in this process. As for directionality in evolution the view that Evolution progresses to more advanced stuff isnt so problematic when intelligence gets thrown into the mix. I would say that Im in total agreement that biological evolution by natural selection is not in any way teleological. But what about when evolution by natural selection produces a species which opens up a meaningful distinction between natural selection and unnatural selection or artificial selection? Human beings are in obvious ways and with varying degrees of success shaping the world as we see fit in accordance with our purposes.gt I would suggest that the allegory to us would be society at large. I dont view culturesociety as God.And I see clearly why that might be a better analogy. But it was just an analogy just to get across the grand scope of the transition in which we are involved.gtIn any case thanks for taking the time to pen your thoughts.Thanks a lot.

In my own experience of raising children we seek to do the same thing in a way so that person can get on in the world as it is.  In the tribal fashion we mark the person or literally cut into the nature of the individual to some extent and work against the natural desire of wanting to be a free individual. ,RadicalChristianity,cfpejen,2,t5_2ty95

738727,0,t1_cgo284g,I mostly disagree with you and I especially disagree with the article. It is as if we are somehow still unconsciously looking at the outside world as a commodity some manufactured material by which we either attain eternal significance or die away. To me the hipster Christian who loves Jesus and just wants to love others is no different than the fundamentalist who tells them to their face they are all going to burn in hell. One distances herself from the Other pushes them so far away to the point that they become an empty shell of a human being one whose presence is at least bearable within the context of our holy standard the other strips the Other of any dignity thus consequently ending in the exact same place that the savvy I read the red letters Christian does. One screams at the Other the other whispers. The managerial strategies are different but both are insidiously profiteering. Somehow the most beautiful story ever told got diluted into a hybrid of culture and religion that people are finding less than appealing. And here is the truth of the article the subtle bait and switch. What is with our obsessive drive toward relevance? Undoubtedly it is a desperate pathological attempt at domesticating humanity to the point that they are no longer a terrifying presence constantly threatening to interrupt our comfortable place in the privileged bourgeois. To me this article says nothing but Im completely threatened and The best defense against a threat is to play into the sensibilities of the culture give them what they want nice people then we will have them on OUR side. Its the school yard lackey who in recognizing the danger of not assimilating accepts the terms and conditions plays along with the bullies games at the mercy of his every whim just to preserve his existence in a system that is bigger and stronger than he is. Or even more of a frightening reality the house slave who sees the oppression all around him and in an attempt to preserve his own life becomes the instrument of his white oppressor. Are these people no different than the system that put them there? Are they not despite their precarious situation of being forced into submission still submitting taking on a subjectivity that does not belong to them that intoxicates them and renders them as harmful and violent as their counterpart. Lord have mercy we are all guilty. We should stop trying to be relevant and we should also stop pretending like Christianity is the new hippy movement there must be something more. Something that doesnt play along by the rules and intended transgressions.  ,RadicalChristianity,cgo8x7o,3,t5_2ty95

994331,0,t1_chh9cjb,Yes. The objectification of the Christian Narrative reducing it to a set of doctrinal limits ultimately ends in a separation of the Other. As both Gilles and Wounded King have said this type of positioning is only founded in a distant benevolent master who dictates the laws of intersubjective cooperation. Maybe its unintentional but there is a violence intrinsic in this type of righteousness. One doesnt have to commit any physical act of oppression to be oppressive.

Christians are people of the book we are constituted in part by our regard for and veneration of a particular book.  Jesus himself was well acquainted with its Old Testament and could quote it with ease.  Obviously reading is in some part an element of the Christian life and following Jesus Christ.  Jesus without scripture is unthinkable.But your concern as I understand it is that theres all this sitting around and reading when Jesus is about action and cultivation of holiness.  Reading of course is part of taking action and part of cultivating holiness.  We are directed by the scriptures we learn the state of the world from various philosophers and the sort.  But none of that matters if its not informing and cultivating the sort of radical habits sustained in a life imitating Christ.  Jesus read yes but he was the book.  And the scriptures on a page are dead the living scriptures are inscribed on the heart.  If none of this is inscribed on our hearts its dead wasteful useless.,RadicalChristianity,ckrsbdt,2,t5_2ty95

The Quakers might also be another good option for you.

If theres a Metropolitan Community Church in your area that might be a good place to start. Basically check out the gaychurch.org resource.

It means that in a way I see hope behind the threat of the apocalypse. It doesnt put an end to humanity. Its possible but not certain. And at the bottom of the pit there is only hope. We are approaching the pit of ignorance.theres more there but this is a good tease I thoughtReview of Virilios book Art and Feargt Virilio states as a Christian I reject nuclear faith Virilio amp Lotringer  . The s movement against nuclear arms was something of a conflict against idolatry protesting the attribution of divinity to the ultimate weapon Virilio amp Lotringer  . This attribution entailed an idolatrous belief the missile no longer the Messiah Virilio amp Lotringer  . Only Christs messianic return will bring peace to believe that nuclear armaments can secure peace idolizes a technology. Even during the peacetime masking pure war we confront a cult. ... Pure War is the absolute idol Virilio amp Lotringer  . Utterly impious pure war as absolute idolatry threatens humanity.gt Since the s idolatry has branched out from the nuclear bomb to the genetic bomb the impending explosion of a genetic bomb ... will be to biology what the atomic bomb was to physics Virilio  . Overrunning moral limits genetic science threatens the unicity of the human race Having broken the taboos of suffocating bourgeois culture we are now supposed to break the being the unicity of humankind Virilio   . Humanitys being inheres in a oneness biotechnology may dismantle by breaking humanity into the genetically enhanced and underprivileged and even by hybridizing humans with nonhumans. Virilios assessment of biotechnologys threat to humanitys unicity echoes the Biblical logic that makes Yahwehs oneness inseparable from Yahweh being the only one. If merely one god among several Yahweh may be compared to enumerated among and mixed with the other ones. Worshipping statues of Baal Dagon or Astarte in the place of Yahweh or juxtaposed with the covenant ark idolaters compromise Yahwehs oneness by implicitly hybridizing Yahweh with other gods. Similarly insinuates Virilio for humanity to be it must be one and so the only one the species uniquely unmixable with any other.also more in this linkFeel free to add more!,RadicalChristianity,cuvze97,1,t5_2ty95

5195606,0,t1_cvc7r9w,I forgot to respond to the part about sharing with other people.After a different spiritual test smaller than the rainy night I felt called to speak in church. I asked the bishop idk what you call him if I could say a few words on stage. We chatted in a back room and I explained my spiritual test. It brought me to tears as it had happened only  hours before. He deflected and said we should set up a meeting to discuss the best way to tell my story. I got home and emailed him my testimony and definition of christianity. He still hasnt gotten back to me.I began sharing with my pastor but when I mentioned I quit my job he cut me off and offered to help me find another one. Ill try again next week.Im vacationing with family next week so that will be the real test. What I feel called to do is my burden no one elses. I only want to share if they are strong enough to handle the burden. Im more than happy to ask for help but the weight Im carrying for Christ may be too heavy for others.Imagine your child saying heshe has a vision that theyll die for Christ. Not exactly what a parent wants to hear.EDIT I dont think Ill have to die for Christ but I will have to give up everything. If that means I am martyred then so be it.

8523014,0,t1_d66ipke,The center of Christianity is the death and resurrection of God in the form of a man named Jesus. The metaphysical aspect of this event is the identity of this man with God yet we come even to this truth through an examination of a life or a few years of a life revealed in the gospels. I suppose then my point is that the only way to discuss metaphysicsor the only point of access to metaphysicsis through this narrativea narrative of a person who lived died and rose again.

9595716,0,t3_5cdc4h,Genesis  can be read as the struggle of God against humanities domineering against Creation. Eve and Adam eating the apple becomes not a philosophical problem but rather a testament to greed and their need to devour all of Creation. I forget who articulates that idea most fully though.Also... the Law in Leviticus tells of Gods relation to the chattel of humanity and it some sense it provides some early animal rights. Revelation discusses the lion and the lamb imagery which could speak of a peaceful creation and a vision for how things ought to be. In Acts  Peter dreams of animals God commands him to eat and he says no. God says nothing that I have made is unclean speaking to the goodness of the created world and creation as it stands.

My changing beliefs led me to think that I could no longer kill people for the US government so I left the navy as a conscientious objector.In order to get the discharge I had to be interviewed many times by more senior officers.  These interviews went into great detail about the development of my beliefs.  Ive put the transcripts of these interviews online.  For example  and In the transcripts I discuss some resources that were helpful for me in making sense of my new understanding of Christianity.

10211987,0,t1_dc1ie1z,gtThat said Im not sure that I agree that asking these questions distracts from looking at the changes we can make in our lives.I probably worded the original post too strongly but I still agree with it.  Heres a slight metaphor  Theres a professor of ethics at UC Riverside named Eric Schwitzgebel  His research has highlighted that people who study ethics professionally do not actually behave more ethically.  For example they commit crimes at the same rates as nonethicists his webpage and blog has many more examples.  So if philosophizing about ethics doesnt make us more ethical why would philosophizing about pacifism make us better pacifists?gtIm not sure of your space in the world but I personally happen to be a white person of pretty substantial privilege. It may be easy for me to call for nonviolent resistance but is is just for me to call for nonviolence from those who face higher levels of oppression?Same space in the world.  Part of my claim above is that its impossible to philosophize about pacifism without making abstract claims about what other people should do in certain situations.  I think Jesuss command to take the plank out of your own eye before removing the speck from someone elses addresses the situation youre talking about above.  But I would extend this to take the plank our of your eye before you even decide which direction you should look in.  As long as theres a plank in your eye youre first priority is to remove that plank.  And the nature of sin is that as soon as you remove a plank your vision is able to see new planks that you couldnt see before. ,RadicalChristianity,dc1l4bx,3,t5_2ty95
10323794,0,t1_dce3e42,gt Isnt the US considering implementing term limits? Not that itll pass in the near future but it seems like its being considered more so no that what Ive seen previously.Im not really up for answering everything right now as Im not a chosen official. But I did wanna respond to this because term limits arent fixing the problem. Had it not been for Trump we wouldve likely had a BushClinton election. Thats either  Bush presidencies or two Clinton presidencies. See the problem? Although the president has term limits we still end up with the same family running the government. The  make up over  of Congress. How are term limits going to change that?gt And just to suggest something way out of left field what if the president was chosen by the whole rest of the world? I dont know exactly how thats even possible but hey fun thought to entertain.Youre still going to end up with someone who has corporate interests in mind since thats where the money is.

11362493,0,t3_624wod,The approach you have to the Bible is in my opinion your biggest hurdle. Fundamentalism has taught you that in order for the Bible to be Godbreathed then it has a unified statement on all matters of faith and doctrine. This then forces the Christian to wrestle with interpretations and theological acrobatics to try to unify parts of the Bible that seem to contradict each other.I would suggest a different approach to the BibleThe Bible contains many books with many different authors all trying to capture their experience of the Divine onto pages of human language. That would easily explain the many views on afterlife in the Bible. Rather than trying to read into Ecclesiastes to explain away the authors disbelief in afterlife we should just hold it in tension with other authors and allow them to disagree and see the beauty in a collection of books of the wide range of human attempts to capture this experience we call God into human language. I dont mean to downplay your post but it seems like unnecessary work in order to hold onto your view of the Bible that has been proven problematic for at least the past century. Look into Pete Enns for a very approachable way to a better approach to understanding what the Bible is and why it seems to have different opinions on different matters and where that leaves us,RadicalChristianity,dfjx111,17,t5_2ty95
