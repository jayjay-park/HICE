3848804,0,t3_34gwt4,Here are a few of my favorite tunesBen lOncle Soul  Soulman If this dudes voice was a person Id date it.Karimouche Ptit Kawa Sort of an indiefolky sounding song. Love this girls voice.Housse de Racket  Aquarium Saw these fellas open for Yelle a few years back. Groovy s sound.La Caution  Culminant Some rap from Morocco these dudes wrote that song from Oceans .You also cant go wrong with Yelle or Stromae. Yelles new album is pretty slammin and even for a newbie to French you should be able to pick out words and some meaning. I particularly like the song Toho because the lyrics feature a really clever play on words. Theres a discussion of it in the comments on the video I linked.Hope that helps.,learnfrench,cquzxoj,2,t5_2sucz

9982152,0,t3_5ijn9l,Yes and yes. The subjunctive is used much more frequently in French than in English and while not necessarily essential meaning people will still understand you its an important part of the language and marks the difference between a beginner and an intermediate or advanced speaker. Finally its important to understand what a mood is. It articulates the perspective of the speaker or more broadly speaking the subject of a sentence so if you understand and can use the subjunctive youll understand much more subtlety and be able to express yourself more subtly.
