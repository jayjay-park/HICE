3418510,0,t3_2zdmz2,I would certainly be happy to help moderate. One concern I have is the proposed layout. Because learnJapanese is a rather successful forum I think the structure should be emulated. So just as there is a Shitsumonday there needs to be a Honyakuday where small things can be asked about and it can prevent cluttering. Lets face it. Having extremely long threads for each specific level for people to post in is confusing and not appealing to the eyes. Now tags to show how difficult a passage is would be helpful but a lot of people will be unfamiliar with what exactly the levels of the JLPT correspond to. For instance the challenge I posted comes from a work that requires N competence to read in full but minus a few spellings the passage chosen is very basic and could be classified as NN. Spoiler codes seem interesting but that would require someone like me with nearnativenative competency in both English and Japanese to produce a flawless translation that everyone would agree upon and respect as the final answer. Unless if Im misinterpreting your intentions that would be extremely hard to get done. Coding for it to happen wouldnt but if it werent for my particular career path being a Japanese linguist I dont think I would otherwise have the skills to be a translation proofreader. ,LearnByTranslating,cphxnpr,1,t5_37f6d
