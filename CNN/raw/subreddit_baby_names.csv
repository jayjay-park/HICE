9957022,0,t3_5i4p7s,Im pretty sure its the name of Nick Cages character in Gone in  Seconds...Thats my only reference for it.  Personally Im not a huge fan. I feel like it might pigeon hole someone a bit. For me it feels like a very country singersouthern name which isnt inherently bad but might not suit an adult who ends up with different tastes than mom and dad. Thats my strongest argument against. My strongest argument for is that its unusual without being madeup and if it has some sentimental or family attachment that gives it a boost.,baby_names,db5fbjy,2,t5_3asde

11648336,0,t3_64r1q7,EDITUPDATE While my wife and I both really like Alistair it didnt seem to fit him. After a lot of humming and hawing we ran into a different name we both really liked. We settled on... drum roll... Gilliam Orville Wlastname. Orville was the name of my wifes grandfather. We didnt like it with the other names but thought it had a ring to it with Gilliam. ,baby_names,dggcpt1,1,t5_3asde
