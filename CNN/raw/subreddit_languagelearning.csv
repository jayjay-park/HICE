844371,0,t3_23na6u,I went to DLI as well. The headstart programs are designed to get you a basic familiarity with the language teach you a handful of survival phrases and set you up for future study. The FSI programs on the other hand were designed to be part of a comprehensive curriculum that could be used in a classroom to get to a working level of proficiency.As far as picking one over the other keep in mind that  Headstart programs were designed for selfstudy while FSI programs were absolutely not.  The headstart program is just thata start. It may be used by people waiting for their DLI class to start when the real learning begins. So that should give you an idea about how far it gets you.  I never took an FSI class but everything I know about government language instruction tells me that instructors likely supplemented the textbook with their own materials and exercises. The FSI programs you find online will probably only be a small part of the instruction diplomats received.My two cents? Try the headstart program. When you finish that segue into the Level  lessons in GLOSS. I think this would be a decent plan for the self studier and none of it will cost you any money.,languagelearning,ch09blv,2,t5_2rjsc

1154350,0,t1_chzbdg1,Would you mind giving a few more details? Im curious to see what youve been doing that works.I ask because a few months ago I tried to learn Russian and Arabic at the same time. I ended up progressing frustratingly slow through both of them and I could not find a good way to budget time between the two. Switching frequently didnt give me enough time to firmly remember topics and vocabulary and switching infrequently caused me to forget what I had learned by the time I returned to one language. I ended up dropping Arabic for the time being and Russian has become significantly easier.Now its possible that Im just currently too busy to take on two languages at once much less two languages that are often ranked among the hardest languages for Englishspeakers so if there is a way to learn multiple languages at once Im all for that. Hopefully Ill feel comfortable in Russian by the time Im in college in which case I can start taking Arabic courses instead of having to teach myself which might free up some time for brushing up on my Spanish or starting Dutch easy or Korean difficult.

1185071,0,t3_27owgm,So Im an American living in Portugal and while the reported percentage on this map is accurate for Portugal it might also be really misleading.  This does not mean that if you visit Portugal and attempt to talk do someone  of the people you encounter wont know how to help you.  The numbers look very low because Portugal is in somewhat of a unique transitional period only  years ago the country was still a fascist dictatorship meaning theres a stark generation gap and a lot of infrastructure problems.Portugal has two or three depending on how you look at it large metro areas and within these metro areas almost every person I have attempted to speak with under the age of  as a functional level of conversational English and many over the age of  will also be able to talk with me as well.  If you go much older than that you run into a large gap due in large part to Portuguese people having less access to education before the dictatorship was overthrown in .  In addition many people who did have access to education before the Carnation Revolution chose to learn French instead of English as it was considered to be more important for Portuguese people to learn until the late s.  Many if not most of the Frenchspeaking Portuguese population seem to have gone on to learn English while studying in Universities.  Taking all of that into account the numbers look even smaller because a huge portion of the Portuguese population still lives in villages with little communication with larger metro areas.  In fact a good number of these smaller municipalities dont have intrastate roads or certain utilities and it was probably years before they heard the government changed and some likely still havent or just dont care.  And as a side note a Portuguese person from a large city might have a lot of difficulty understanding local dialects from these villages.So any part of Portugal an immigrant would usually care to live in or a tourist might care to visit is very modern and educated and globalized so as a result there is a lot of English in Lisbon and Porto.  In fact many linguistic professionals in Portugal fear that Portuguese might be very quickly dying in Portugal in favor of English.,languagelearning,ci2xttt,18,t5_2rjsc

A lot of Germans see asking someone where theyre from right off the bat as impolite and unless communication is really impossible will just keep trying in German. When I moved to Germany I could hardly speak any German A on a good day and I had a grand total of one person switch to English with me after I told him I didnt know how to talk about warhammer k in German.Everyone just kind of went on about their business and didnt make a big deal out of me stumbling through the German I had looked up right before I left the apartment.

If you remove the verb from a sentence then it becomes completely incomprehensible but a lot of more unusual but still common verbs will fall into the  category whilst the  will be filled with things like personal pronouns I he she them we it conjunctions and but however and prepositions on with at alongside opposite. Verbs tend to be very varied so most verbs are not common enough to make it into the  most common yet if you tried to make a sentence consisting f only of personal pronouns prepositions and the three most basic verbs you can think of youd find it very difficult to have a meaningful conversation about anything other than can you get the butter for me? ,languagelearning,cishci2,5,t5_2rjsc

1571948,0,t3_2c9f4n,Hey! I can answer this! Sort of.My parents sort of taught me. I lived in Poland for the first six years of my life and when we moved to Chicago I had to learn English. Fast. Luckily I went to a really good fancy school for the first two years where I got basically a private tutor for free and learned English in  months although my spelling was bad. By the end of st grade I was completely fluent and I dont think not knowing the language in kindergarten had a bad effect on my education. I think it probably helped considering my native English speaking friends come to me to proofread for them and just help them in general. Theyre typically shocked when I tell them English is my second language. So if you would teach your child only one language no English and send them to a good enough school I dont think theyd have an issue. Or if you find a fancy bilingual school and do the opposite same thing. I only speak English online and at school yet Im fluent.Heres a little secret have them watch shows in different languages. Read to them a lot. Speak to them in that language and make sure they know that speaking the other language is okay and encouraged. Reward them for it. My cousin lets call him Danny who is  or  at this point is the grandson of Polish immigrants. His mother wanted to teach him Polish since she spoke it at home but she never spoke to him in Polish only English. She would let him watch American TV all the time only read to him in English and left him at his grandparents house every day. What did Danny do here? Did he learn Polish with his grandpa? Nope he watched TV and did everything in English. He never speaks Polish. Same thing with a lot of my younger cousins. They simply dont speak the language because this will sound rude their parents are too lazy. Danny could be fluent in English and Polish right now but his mom never bothered. Now my other cousin who well call Nick speaks a good  languages and hes . He lives in Sweden speaks Finnish to his dad Polish to his mom speaks Swedish because Sweden duh and learns English at school I think? Or a tutor and speaks it with me and his dad. Hes got a younger brother who is the same. Danny could learn Polish but his parents and grandparents are just not teaching it to him. Nick and his younger brother have been taught those  languages because their parents wanted to do it and put in the effort to. I speak Polish and English because my parents never stopped speaking to me in Polish even though their English is fine. TLDR Put in an effort read to them have them watch TV shows in different languages and dont worry about them not speaking English if you dont teach it to them right away. They can learn at school.,languagelearning,cjdbfq9,24,t5_2rjsc

Sure new wordsdefinitions like blog tweet etc get added every year but  of it stays the same. APIs are constantly evolving Just look at the changes in the iOS API between iOS  and  roughly two years which is the time it takes to gain a significant level of mastery in a natural language. Also APIs are a set of tools you use for a particular task. As with everything in technology these tools are constantly changing. Natural languages are more farreaching and stable. So basically I would recommend familiarizing yourself with the broad overview of an API know what it is capable of and where it is lacking. If you find yourself using certain parts of it more you will probably familiarize yourself more with the nittygritty details of it naturally. However for the majority of the API it is perfectly normal to be good at reading API manuals examples and support forums in an adhoc manner.

1951803,0,t3_2gzi3g,I studied Russian first and then French. As someone who only knew English and Chinese growing up Russian was quite difficult. It was the first time I had to actually grasp concepts like direct and indirect objects because Russian declines words based on how theyre used in a sentence. However I found that it had a pretty rigid structure and didnt really deviate which meant once you learn the rules you should be able to speak pretty easily. To answer your question I found French to be the easiest because there is so much overlap in vocabulary and the grammar was not nearly as difficult as Russian. Plus if I didnt know a word I just thought of the English equivalent and made it sound French and  of the time I would be correct. I think once I got a really good understanding of grammar as an organizational structure of language applying that made learning subsequent languages easier. ,languagelearning,ckoe9m8,2,t5_2rjsc

Im level  in German now.  Same story with French and Im level  there.  At that point I was four languages in and didnt want to stop doing any of them and when Dutch Irish and Danish all got released I picked those up too and Im level  in all three of those.It was always my intention to do no more than two at a time and pick complementary languages so there was some overlap but that all kind of went sideways.Honestly at this point other than the time investment learning seven at a time isnt any harder than three or four.  Now that summers over Im on by  day for a streak and that includes ALL of the languages.  I wont lie and say that all of those days I did a complete lesson.  Some of those days I could only fit in a timed lesson and maybe only got five or six points per language but I am also doing Memrise to supplement.Ideally I do new lessons in the morning and then review at night.  Thats the ideal schedule if Im not busy.  If its a busy week then I will do just review and try to keep the tree gold.

When I used it I had the feeling that it would be a lot more useful if I was using it for a language that was close to my own rather than one that was different in nearly every way. I did learn how to read Korean before using it but my speed was really slow so all of the speaking exercises were really annoying. I made a lot of false assumptions from using RS too because I was creating rules since it didnt teach any that didnt exist or were wrong. The sentences in RS are frequently very unnatural too. And they teach in a cookie cutter method that seems to be based on what would be logical in English but not Korean.Of course I also felt like even if this was a language close to my native language I wouldnt want to use it because there are so many cheaper and better resources out there.

2510614,0,t3_2oblrb,As you know you can write Cantonese using Standard Chinese or written Cantonese. Standard Chinese is almost like Mandarin but there are some differences. When I talk in Cantonese online with native speakers they use written Cantonese and all the resources Ive seen from English use either written Cantonese or just romanisation sometimes referencing the Standard Chinese characters too. But obviously written Cantonese is much better for learning as you can better associate pronunciations to characters.Most Hongkongers use Cangjie or Sucheng also called Quick. As unonneb said Cangjie is based on the radicals that make up a character. For example typing  JWJ gives you . They arent all as simple as that but that gives you a basic idea. As there are only  keys on a keyboard but hundreds of radicals each key can represent more than one. This sounds difficult at first but if you start learning youll get the hang of it really easily. I use Cangjie to type Cantonese and I would highly recommend learning it.Sucheng is the same as Cangjie but you only type the first and last part of the character and it gives you a list of possibilities to choose from.Before I learnt Cangjie I typed using a Jyutping keyboard which I downloaded. The problem with this comes when you need to type Cantonese on a device without a Jyutping keyboard installed. Its also slower than typing Cangjie though quicker at first and often you have to select the character from a list.Before that I typed it using Mandarin Pinyin and that was a real pain. I had to translate each pronunciation to Mandarin. And if youre typing written Cantonese the commonly used Cantonese characters would be far down the list.,languagelearning,cmm9xi5,1,t5_2rjsc

Apart from the time consumed making cards which I never enjoyed theres the issue that the Leitner repetition isnt nearly as efficient as Ankis. Computers are able to time cards much more accurately to match your forgetting curve.  drawers simply dont cut it. Plus Anki also takes into account the individual difficulty of a card to show it to you sooner than other cards of the same level if you seem to have trouble memorizing it.If you dont like Anki have you tried Memrise? It uses a similar algorithm but the website is made to look more fun. I personally prefer Anki also because I can take it with me on my cellphone and study cards while on the subway or on a beach but for you Memrise may be a compromise between the efficiency of computerguided memorization and the creative feel of homemade cards.,languagelearning,cmr36km,3,t5_2rjsc

3044837,0,t1_codhaod,Duolingo is popular I think because its fun not because of its effectiveness. Heres some ideas Minimal pair training. This technique comes from speech therapy but I first heard it applied to languages on the fluentforever site. You take two words that differ in a single sound and play one of them then try to figure out which word it was. Its helped me pay attention to and really learn to differentiate new sounds. Minimal translation. Except for basic words I shouldnt be doing the loiseau gt bird thing. For my flashcards I use GIFs for verbs and pictures or sounds for concrete nouns. Teach cooccurrences and teach everything in context. Cooccurrences are words that tend to fit together. And every word should be learned in a variety of sentences so we can see its actual usage. It doesnt seem difficult to create some kind of Langtype thing within the site. Except give us direction. For this lesson you write about X lets say birds and somebody will correct it. Bonus pointslingots for you if you correct somebody elses entry! Dialogues and dictation. You hear something and write it down. Thats great stuff right there. Preferably with a native speaker or even better a variety of native speakers with different accents. I think hearing different accents help one understand a language more holistically. Thematic vocabulary. This is I think one of the reasons Duo is successful. And dont just look at frequency lists. I found this cool thing called the Universal Dictionary  Its not the best but its interesting. The French Wiktionary has this great page that shows words by category  and that kind of stuff is fascinating. Thats probably a bit much but those are the first ideas that jump to mind.

I could introduce a German mode into Tengwa and then write German with it or write Russian with the Latin script as a less fictive and radical example but it is not done. If its not done by native speakers adult native speakers than it doesnt matter that its theoretically possible.And homophones arent much of an issue in spoken language so you could also write it like that. In fact in many languages writing the venacular like it was spoken was very common until the need for universal literacy and therefore for standard orthography arose.Japanese is also not the only language with homophones. In fact the only reason why native speakers make mistakes between your and youre as well as their there and theyre is because in spoken language context provides the information needed to untangle the homophones.Kanji is not a necessity to write Japanese. Its also not a necessity to read Japanese. I am very sure that if the Japanese wouldnt be such a traditional people and didnt already have a perfectly as in it works not in it works good working system to teach the population the kanji in place kanji would have been replaced by something else decades ago.Just look at Korea. Hangul has been invented a few  years ago. New ruler decided that an educated population is a dangerous population and got rid of it again. After Japanese occupation I think. Theres a great raskhistorians podcast about language policies in east Asia they had a similar mixed system as we see in Japanese today but then decided to just get rid of it entirely.

You can either leverage them for basic conversation type classes or prepare your own plans based on what you are currently studying. You can read a text and have them correct your pronunciation and then have them ask you questions about what you understood you can practice dialogues from your study material or ask them to  role play reallife scenarios like going to a restaurant a bakery or an emergency visit to a doctors office. The sky is the limit. I even frequently book a lesson but instead of taking the class I ask the tutor to record a bunch of sentences to accompany my studies so that I can use them in my reviews and flashcards.

4358046,0,t3_3axhvv,The writing system isnt difficult but it does take a lot of time. Its a bit mindnumbing. You just have to memorize them. The good news is after you have the first  or so under your belt it gets much easier because youre familiar with the characters components and how theyre constructed and can use that as clues to help remember the pronunciation and meaning. Also dont learn handwriting. Reading and typing is good enough  of the time. You can learn to handwrite later if you move to China and need it. I would have given up if I had tried from the beginning but now that I can read a couple thousand characters and use the language a bit its not nearly as frustrating to learn handwriting.In general Id say the FSIs numbers are right. It is taking me about three or four times longer to learn Chinese than Spanish or German did. The grammar doesnt require much memorization but its hard to get used to. Everything more complex than the simplest sentences is backassards from an English perspective. There are no shortcuts for vocab. Listening is a pain first because you have to get used to the tones then you have to learn to deal with the wide variety of accents some of which use different tones and consonants.But like the writing system its not so much difficult as it is timeconsuming.

I listen to News in Slow Italian on my commutes to work and I might not understand a word here or there my comprehension is close to . I recently I met a guy on iTalki who wanted to speak English with me and he just happened to be from the Basque country so I figured Ive always wanted to learn Basque we could do an exchange. I found Assimils Basque course in French and thought hey Ill give this a try and to my surprise I have no real difficulty reading the French in that book. I have never studied French at all.You cannot possibly make a wrong choice here. If you learn French you have access to all the Assimil courses but a large number have been translated to Italian. If you have a chance to go to Italy for a while you should study the language. The amount of resources available for learning Italian is so amazingly abundant at all levels up to and including C that I have issues sticking to a single resource for long. There are multiple series of books just for listening comprehension for basic intermediate and advanced. There are books just to help intermediate learners with their writing. There are books that exist with just topics and followup questions for conversations. And on top of that Italians are insanely passionate about helping others learn Italian.

She simply gives up speaking English and her boyfriend comes and explains to me that in the whole trip hes been trying to get her to speak English with people but everyones been speaking Spanish with her and that now that she was leaving she simply gave up.So that made me feel like an asshole after they left and realized what I did.

Most of the resources that are available to learn Tamil teach a sort of a standardized colloquial Tamil. Both Palakkad and Kumari Tamil has quite an influence of Malayalam in it. Here are a few good resources Colloquial Tamil  I see from your flair that you know French. Theres an Assimil course that teaches you Tamil through French. Assimil  Le tamoul sans peine. Do you parents know how to read and write Tamil? If so you can take their help. Also I am sure that they understand most of the dialects in Tamil and can guide you through it. Tamil requires a lot of immersion with native speakers and your family can be your best resource. Let me know if you have any other doubts.,languagelearning,ctue7o5,3,t5_2rjsc

Obviously having a picture of the word is ideal. If it is abstract at least stare at the word itself and imagine flames coming off of the letters. I even make sound effects after I pronounce the word.For feminine words imagine them ice cold. In a block of ice. Frost covering the word or a picture. I look at the ones I really have trouble with and even perform a fake shiver after I pronounce it.For neuter try shattering. Like a mirror smashed on the ground shattering. Shattering into a million pieces. Imagine the image flying all over the room.I do this with my Anki deck and honestly when I flip to a new picture more often than not I remember the temperature of the word and the gender comes to me quickly. Like I said if it is abstract then you can imagine the letters of the world itself being hot cold or shattering.Hope it helps.

The court members analyse his behaviour and clothes but cannot guess where this scholar has come from. The scholar the gives them an ultimatum if the court members are unable to guess where he is from by tomorrow morning the scholar will leave with the kings weight in gold. The king urges his most trusted court member to come up with an answer and quick. In the dead of the night while the scholar is asleep the kings trusted court member sneaks up on him and splashes him with icecold water. The scholar jerks awake in surprise and curses loudly. The court member runs to the Kings chambers along with the scholar and correctly guesses where he is from.Dumbstruck the scholar asks how he was able to find out.

Im going to use a bit of IPA and I dont know if youre familiar with it but from now on I will use j to represent the English y sound.The letter  represents the diphthong j  is the sound represented by the Czech letter e and its also the vowel in the English word pet. It can also represent the vowel  when after a palatal consonant. In the case of the word m that would be pronounced mj but it seems the j sound assimilates to the nasal consonant m and becomes a palatal nasal. So it ends of being pronounced m.,languagelearning,cwm6hy7,1,t5_2rjsc
5565023,0,t3_3rbnhw,Id start with Latin and then go in the following order. Romanian due to how different it is from the other Romance languages youve named. Ive studied Portuguese and Spanish and I feel habits I have learned from them have made it harder for me to integrate certain aspects of Italian grammar that are a bit more complex than the equivalent structures in IberoRomance.. Italian. French.  and  SpanishPortugueseCatalanBasically I think that starting from the least familiar and complex end of the spectrum from the point of view of an English speaker will speed up acquisition of the other languages over the longer term. Phonology aside I personally find French and Italian to be pretty damn similar in their grammar but the real reason I chose French after Italian is for the purposes of laddering. I like many of the resources Ive seen in Italian for learning French. Laddering from Spanish to Catalan and Portuguese should be pretty easy as well. I dont think the order matters much between Portuguese and Catalan as Spanish is likely going to have more resources for both of them than Catalan will have for Portuguese or Portuguese will have for Catalan. Personally I would not choose to go West to East due to the fact that Romanian still has things like neuter gender aspects of case etc. IMO its easier to get used to things like that upfront and Id want to confront it as soon as I could after Latin.,languagelearning,cwmw3yg,2,t5_2rjsc

This means the sentence has a single tempo or beat.gtI cant go.The negative has two stressed syllables meaning tempi or beats. The t sound is usually imperceptible so from a practical perspective in normal speech the only thing that separates the affirmative from the negative is the number of stressed syllables.

There are sooo many resources and courses and whathaveyou.I would much rather a well done comprehensive and authentic vocabulary resource than yet another divisive attempt at some purported beallendall.Now if you were simply suggesting that the vocabulary words be given context that I can agree with. Although Ill admit that Ive only ever used Memrise to familiarize myself with words so that when I do actually see them in context Ill have at least some idea what they mean. I think however that this is a necessary way to approach any technique designed to expedite vocabulary development so much something Memrise has thus far proven quite effective at. Moreover good course designers can build usage context and grammar notes into their courses through Memrises interface if theyre diligent enoughThe advantage this has over Forvo is that all clips are guaranteed native speakers at a certain standard of audio quality. And where it does cede a disadvantage to Forvo in terms of breath of languages and terms I still think its worth noting that they arent exactly being stingy with their goals for how much of an early status the initiative is still at.Lastly this initiative is meant to cater to the Memrise platform which is crucially a flash repetition and test based vocabulary program. These are easy to manufacture. Getting them suited with consistently good quality native audio is much much harder and one of the biggest holes in the digital language learning world today. Memrise attempting to cover this side of things was a great strategic move both from a business perspective filling a missing role as well for consistencys sake  they have some capital not just another chap on the internet interested in solving everyones problems via poorly planned crowdsourcing.No one site or resource is ever very likely to be a onestop yellowbrick road to learning a language.

I guess Im a bit sensitive because of late Ive been seeing a lot of posts on Reddit where AmericansBrits lament on the mistakes their fellow countrymen make and you have hordes of Europeans jump in and say yeah you guys have such an easy language and you still fuck it up your language is a primitive mongrel tongue so why is it so hard for you and so easy for us we speak better English than most native speakers Americans might be native speakers but they suck at their own language etc etc. Thats more than just a little bit insulting and Ive been seeing a lot of it lately hence the rant I guess sorry about that. A lot of what I said mightve been with all that in mind.Anyway I dont get this educated native speaker standard in general. The CEFR tests something totally different from sounding native or whatever. Ill defer to your experience.

If you want to use Anki or any SRS to learn new material then you absolutely must create your own flash cards of words that you encountered in context instead of using a list that somebody else posted on the web or in a book. Its true that image association flashcards with audio take more time to make than LgtL flashcards. But theyre vastly more effective. If you memorize L gt L flashcards then when the time comes to actually speak the language you first need to think about what youre going to say then figure out how to translate those thoughts into English and then translate that English into your target language. It takes too long to be effective and you will lose information with each translation. You should be training your brain to go directly between your thoughts and your target language without wasting any brainpower on English. And thats what no English flash cards do.,languagelearning,czeynnn,9,t5_2rjsc
6394764,0,t3_439gqp,Honestly I dont know how people learn a language without those factors. If you dont love the culture why are you learning?

You have to love SOMETHING about the language and culture to continue to a decent level. For example in the PhD exams most of my peers just learned French and German in order to pass the exams and never looked at those languages again. That just feels like wasted effort to me when you could have easily taken them to a conversation level but they didnt care about France or Germany.On the other hand those studying Old Norse because they were writing their dissertation on that topic would pour  hours a week into studying it  simply because they loved the culture.,languagelearning,czgiolb,9,t5_2rjsc

So youll probably just have to learn the normal daily language I dont think there is a quick route to understanding only his speeches.You could also ask raskhistorians about the historical assesment of Hitler. I live in a town where there are around  memorials and monuments of WW and have several family members and acquaintances who have been in camps during that time period so I think you can guess what my opinion of this man is.However I dont agree with the stupid downvoting.

7142421,0,t3_4d8fru,This question might get buried but hopefully somebody sees my question and can give me some advice related to GlossikaI bought the program simply for the fact that it had clear audio with a native speaker I planned on using the program to improve my accent.I consider myself to be a BC in Spanish many native speakers say Im fluent even though I have my own doubts.Anyway after listening to some of the lessons my confidence in the language went down a bit. Heres why. I can understand everything said but I feel like I cant comprehend it fast enough. In English when I hear something its liek second nature. In a normal Spanish conversation its almost like second nature. With Glossika it takes longer than normal. I think this is because the sentences are so random??. When I listen to the EnglishSpanish lessons it takes me way longer than Id like to translate. Even then my translation differs from the one in the lesson. Id like to think that its because Im used to thinking in Spanish and never translate from English to Spanish. I see this is a flaw with the program although its hard to avoid translating at lower levels of learning.I guess Im looking for feedback on what I said above I never really asked a question.

7523959,0,t1_d2xci8t,gtOne word a day is too slow. I studied foreign language in a university program and our professor claimed that in some cases students had been expected to learn more than one hundred words a day. I was like Wait is that possible? Apparently it is. Part of language learning is just memorizing vocabulary hopefully in the context that youre going to be using it. I bruteforced Esperanto by sitting with a dictionary and just looking up words I didnt know and thats been a tactic that helped me succeed in Persian as well. If youre not spending a lot of time with a dictionary youre probably not learning fast enough. Yes its tedious work but it must be done. Having bilingual people translate words for you on the spot is a great boon that you should take advantage of if you have it. Electronic dictionaries are almost as fast. Sometimes you have to look up the same word twenty times before you stop forgetting it. Thats normal too I think.Couldnt agree more. Some people think that  words a day would mean not only to find those words and write them down or to save them in SRS but also to know exactly how to use them and have them memorised in that very day which is indeed close to impossible for somebody with limited learning time. I decided to take a break from Anki for a while so I can maximise the number of words I can find and save and so far it seems like a pretty doable goal really. I dont really suffer from not using Anki on a daily basis because exposing myself to so much native material and armed with nothing but a dictionary gave me that sense of nuance that you must acquire if youre planning to go past B. Diving directly into native material from as early as possible seems to be by far the most efficient learning method and Ive yet to meet somebody who has learned a language in another way.,languagelearning,d2xfqpw,2,t5_2rjsc

7536450,0,t3_4ijg3a,I think this is a super interesting question! I have some ideas on why it might be.. Most English native speakers have no idea of what the level of properly fluent is because they never workliveend up managing tricky situations in the foreign language. Ive been learning German for almost two years. I can read books and websites function just fine in my everyday lifechoreshobbies watch TV with almost full comprehension. Im sure most English monolinguals would say I was fluent. But I know how hard I find reading tax documents or having to use German for work or following a complex group conversation in a noisy place. Hong Kong parents are probably very aware of just how good their childs English needs to be to avoid holding them back in their career.. Anglo culture at the moment doesnt value long years of hard work. People want to believe that things are achievable and changeable on a short time frame. E.g. TV talent shows TV weight loss camp shows books like The First  hours. Diligence and year on year of steady working are rarely seen as character traits of heroes in books or TV. I think theres something very appealing about the idea that one day youll find your talent or itll be spotted and your whole life will change. Or that youll suddenly decide to pursue language learningcodingweight loss and youll see results in a short period of time. There is a book I like called So Good they Cant Ignore You which talks a lot about knuckling down and building a rare and valuable skill through hundred and thousands of hours of difficult practice. I like it because I think its true but it isnt the most appealing message. Id much rather believe my  hours had got me to  words understood on Duolingo than a drop in a  hour ocean required for fluency.,languagelearning,d2yuvw1,6,t5_2rjsc

Lies es mal wieder PIch vertrage dir dass Merkel nicht mit der Trkei verhandeln soll wenn sie ideologisch und moralisch rein sein will. Eine Rechtfertigung wre dass Merkel den Verlust seiner Partei bemerkt hat und glaubt dass sie dazu antworten muss. Am Start war diese Flchtlingskrise ein humanitres Problem Noch muss sie kmpfen um die Ablsung der EU zu verhten. Es scheint mir noch ein weiteres Fall der Gefahr der Innenpolitik zu sein.Auch wenn du glaubst dass Merkel bei ihren Drohungen eine falsche Entscheidung trifft ist es noch ein Problem dass nicht jedes Mitgliederstaat seine humanitre Pflicht erfllen will. Die EU braucht Einigung gegenber die Flchtlingspolitik. Eine bessere Verteilung der Flchtlinge wrde die Krise mildern. Diese Situation ist kein Fehler Merkels Es wird schwieriger mit der wachsenden Rechtspopulismusbewegung zu verhandeln. Ein hnliche Situation findet in den USA mit der hartnckigen Republican Party statt wo Obama versucht mit ihnen einen Kompromiss ber viele unterschiedliche Politikthemen zu schlieen. Noch ist die konservative Partei nicht kompromissbereit.Ich glaube eine gute Lsung ist eine gleiche durch BIPGDPVergleiche zugeordnete Verteilung berall in Europa. Ich hoffe dass ein Kompromiss stattfinden wird.Also kurz gesagt hast du teilweise recht. Meine Position ist offenbar nicht an allen Fronten vertretbar aber ich biete dafr eine leichte Errterung an In dieser Welt ist es fast vollstndig unmglich einen reinen Standpunkt immer zu vertreten.

7746997,0,t3_4letjg,I assumed as well that you meant your native languages when you talked about mother languages. I know that the womens crisis hotline where Im at has high demand for women Russian to English translators. Im sure theres a similar need in a lot of other social programs too. Theres substantially less need for German and French though it sounds like you have historical reasons for wanting to get into German.I havent spent much time with French yet but Im fairly comfortable reading and hearing German if not speaking and writing. Ive read a few dozen German books I started the language about a year and a half ago. Id say that for reading at least Im very comfortable and Im two thirds of the way through my first book in Russian the lion the witch and the wardrobe. I also have at least a little familiarity with Japanese. Back in high school and college I taught myself enough Japanese to play through some RPGs and read manga.Anyway purely from a work load perspective German is a great pick. The word order case system and detachable verb prefixes make it a little more foreign than spanish but its still very natural coming from English. A ton of thoughts can be expressed fairly clearly with a naive translation even if you dont know how to say it the way a German person would.So far at least Russian seems very very different. Even possessives are fairly strange and a lot of thoughts and concepts end up being phrases with vastly different word choice than what youd think to use coming from English... its more like Japanese in that sense. Knowing a lot of words doesnt mean youll know when to use them and a naive attempt to communicate will leave you sounding very foreign if youre understandable at all. The Russian case system is also substantially more complicated than Germans to say nothing of numbers and the fact that perfectimperfect verbs are often two different words. All that said Cyrillic is really easy to learn. Itll legit take a few hours total to get pretty comfortable not much longer than that and theyll be second nature.Sounds like Russian will be more useful for your life goals but its looking like it could very well be as deep a well as Japanese... but its a little early for me to say. If you do go for it though its an interesting language and theres a ton of interesting media. Not much in the way of graded readers though unfortunately...,languagelearning,d3mrzi1,1,t5_2rjsc

One of the reasons people promote international languages is to promote equality andor peace and having one nations language be elevated to this status would probably be a bad idea.I think it would be best if everybody regardless of national origin knew a local language a local lingua franca like Swahili in its region of Africa  more L than L speakers and then this language.A constructed language if made by an international team would be a perfect neutral language so I dont think any of the existing constructed languages would work because Esperanto would be hard for someone who speaks only Hausa or Hindi. ,languagelearning,d4y9o7r,16,t5_2rjsc

Just be aware of Russians palatalized letters its not just the vowels that have hard and soft forms most Russian consonants actually have a hard and soft form too and you will need to learn to distinguish and form these.While pronunciation of the various Russian sounds is important you will want to pay particular attention to the stress of words. In Russian theres no clear stress pattern and the stress can change the meaning of some words.

The fact that I have to actively translate while telling German jokes to nonGermanspeakers seems to support this.But either way Im really curious about whether this has been studied and what linguistspsychologists know about it  it must be a pretty common phenomenon.,languagelearning,d62xove,1,t5_2rjsc
8491546,0,t1_d61o42n,Just wanted to say Props to you for actually saying this. Shame that people with no training or interest in sociology feel that theyre suddenly experts on whether or not racism exists. I should add that I also dont have any formal sociological instruction but thats all the more reason for me to defer to the opinions of experts in the field.It seems that people assume that racism has to be intentional that it cant be an unconscious reflex due in part to psychology and part to institutionalized racism. So any mention that everyday peoples behavior might be racist gets taken by many as a personal attack so they go on the defensive. If only people would understand that tolerance means acknowledging ones own unintentional racist tendencies and trying to eliminate them. But Im probably preaching to the choir here. Addendum As I mentioned in another comment I notice this racial bias all the time in Germany even though the microaggression side of it isnt directed at me. Its the reason that I as someone with red hair something incredibly rare among native Germans is assumed to be a native speaker while someone with clear MiddleEastern or Turkish descent something rather common among native Germans is assumed to be a foreigner. Flattering though it is to be mistaken for a native speaker I wish that the fact that Im white werent part of the reason for that.,languagelearning,d62zppb,4,t5_2rjsc

Plus if your goal is to travel in the target languages country you can get further with a dozen phrases that you can speak and understand than a novels worth of words that you can only read.

8716985,0,t3_4zdsgi,English is actually my parents third language however my siblings and I still managed to learn how to speak our parents native language Kapampangan. One reason that made this possible is because its a regional language that is widely spoken in my home province. We were usually banned to use it when in school because the Department of Education decided that every Filipino must speak Filipino or Tagalog even though the whole country is composed of other ethnic groups e.g. Kapampangan Cebuano Ilonggo etc that have their own language. The way I see it its an effective way of uniting everyone under a common language but it disregards the importance of nonTagalog peoples own language. I think theyre making efforts on changing that now though. On the other hand my other relatives dont bother teaching their kids their native language because English is seen as more important and want their kid to look smarter Speaking English makes you look educatedsmart and one of the higher class in Philippines. Thus their kids cant speak Kapampangan. ,languagelearning,d6v9g3z,2,t5_2rjsc

8770846,0,t3_507coj,Going off my experience with German and Japanese at least the lag is totally normal and will take a long time to really diminish. For you to understand a given phrase without any lag every single part the whole structure all the words all the grammar everything needs to be completely self evident intuitive and simple before youll be able to process it without thinking about it. I mean thats what it means to understand it without any lag after all right? To get it without thinking about it. Theres also time it takes just to get listening as a skill down. Even if you could have really comfortably read what youre listening to if you arent used to listening itll still take some processing. So... just sink in time. Youll see things change as you go. I dont think age matters much. I started German last year Im  now I picked it up really quickly all things considered I think. I bet if I were to tackle a language as hard as Japanese Id be able to do far better now than I did back in high school when I was getting into Japanese for the first time. It might be harder to juggle a family and work and everything with a language hobby but as far as actual ability goes I could easily run circles around my teenage self and kid self too if we were comparing hour per hour results. ,languagelearning,d720rl0,7,t5_2rjsc
8788834,0,t3_50hreg,First dont use the mobile version of Memrise except out of convenience.  If you do use it cover up the answer choices and if you have to use process of elimination to get your answer then intentionally choose the wrong one.Are you comfortable with the script yet?  If not consider pausing your SRS program or if youre using Anki you dont have to pause anything and write the words by hand each time they come up.  Then check to make sure what you wrote is correct.For Vietnamese which uses the Latin alphabet I dont have to do this so Memrise is perfect.  For Japanese I use Anki for Kanji because I need to make sure I retain everything and the extra physical component of writing the characters helps me retain them.  This should be true for most people!The number of words I can learn in a day depends on how easy the words are and if theyre connected to words I already know.  I can handle ten to fifteen difficult Vietnamese words or twenty to thirty easy ones.What does that mean?  Well one word I recently learned as nim vui.  Im already familiar with nim from nim tin and vui is a really basic word so I didnt need much work to remember that one.  A more difficult word is something like chng ngi vt which may or may not be connected to words Ive seen before I know of ngi but Im not sure if its the same here and Im not sure if vt is the same as in vt l.This is where knowing Chinese characters would help if Vietnamese still had those.  More importantly its where Chinese characters help with both Korean and Japanese.I strongly recommend starting on Hanja now because that will help you a lot later on when you encounter a lot of homophones and there will be times when youll be able to figure out the meaning of a word just from seeing the Hanja whether the pronunciation is obvious or not.  Plenty of books still use Hanja so youll get to use it if you want to read any real Korean materials.If I were starting over Id drill Hanja as much as I could early on and Id work through a textbook there are lots of them and Korean textbooks arent too expensive  just pick one from a university in Korea and youll be okay.  Id put the textbook vocabulary into Anki or Memrise Memrise is good because itll force you to type in Korean too  but be sure to practice writing by hand until youre comfortable with Hangul and Id find additional vocab to study one of those longer courses on Memrise or a nice big Anki deck.Korean grammar is tough.  Dont take it for granted.Id recommend getting some easy listening practice through podcasts aimed at Korean learners.  Fortunately those are easy to come by.  Good luck finding some for Vietnamese.

Mastering Norwegian will make you fluently read Danish and to some extent understand the spoken language while with Swedish its the opposite a near fluent comprehension of the spoken language and an ok grip on the written language. Faroese is closer to Icelandic than any of the other nordic languages but it wont be entirely useless. From a danish perspective I can say that I dont entirely understand FaroeseIcelandic but usually some words are familiar enough for me to grasp the context and overall meaning of a textwritten dialogue in them.

That would double your reviews but you will practice both recognition and production. And by having  different sentences the chance of just memorizing the sentence and not the word is smaller.Then when you feel you know that word and you regularly use it when you write or speak if you think you cant possibly forget it you can suspend those cards.,languagelearning,d8g7zr4,2,t5_2rjsc

9316086,0,t1_d8wunpg,Its a program and an app. Its free for PC and android but fairly expensive for the iphone presumably due to Apples annoyingly complex app submission process. Its basically a flash card creation tool with a smartphone app to go along with it that you can use to review your cards on the go. It works kind of like memrise in practice if youve used that. You learn your new cards then every time you review it you rank your response. If you did good it waits longer until next time. If you did poor it waits less time. I havent used anki in quite a while but if you learn  new cards a day that seemed to end up to about  minutes of review time every day once youre two months in and neck deep in it it adds up slowly. Its a perfectly suited tool for school since while anki will never get you fully automatic with the material youre learning no artificial system will it will do a great job arming you for tests. The main catch with anki not all cards are created equal. Theres a number of ins and outs to creating them to make them as useful as possible... plus theres the time you need to spend actually creating them as well that you have to take into account. Still a great tool for certain ends. ,languagelearning,d8wvs2r,2,t5_2rjsc

Are you tired?gtReplies with the appropriate conjugation of the verb bos to begtOv  Yes Literally I amgtNag ov  No Literally I am notNot am IgtNote I definitely was at the time of writing this! Green is generally merged into the colour blue glas. The only exception is for green manmade things where gwyrdh is used instead loaned from the Latin viridisgtAn lowarth glas  The green garden.gtAn karr gwyrdh  The green car. Only one definite article  an as opposed to ellaloslas or derdiedasdendemdes. There is no indefinite article.gtAn causes an initial consonant mutation in feminine nouns and masculine nouns referring to people. No neuter gender itdas. Everything is he ev or she hi. Counting is vigecimal in twenties so the number  is written seytek warn ugens literally seventeen on twenty. Plurals exist although the singular of the noun is used in conjunction with numbers.gtMorlader  male pirate a pirategtAn vorladron  The piratesgtTri morlader  Three pirates literally three pirate The numbers two three and four have masculine and feminine forms which must be used with the appropriate gender of the noun Feminine numbers italicisedgt Dew  Diwgt Tri  Teyrgt Peswar  PedergtDew  diw causes secondstate consonant mutations in the following noun.gtTri  teyr cause thirdstate consonant mutations in the following noun. There are five different types of consonant mutations. I referred to second state and third state above since theyre the most common encountered.gtSecond state affects several consonants at the start of feminine singular nouns and masculine plural nouns referring to people. The adjective of the noun is also affected. The definite article an as well as some prepositions such as dhe to cause this gtBre HillgtAn vre The hillgtThird state affects masculine and feminine nouns coming after the number three as well as a couple of posessive pronouns. gtMutations are said to come from a linguistic phenomenon called sandhi.

Dhe togtDhymm  To megtDhis  To yougtDhodho  To him  itgtDhedhi To her  itgtDhyn  To usgtDhywgh  To yallgtDhedha  To them The verb to have is not used for posession.

9972952,0,t1_db4z2wp,Well I got from B where speaking was my weakest skill to C with high note in the speaking part without properly speaking to anyone for years nope being a tourist and buying bread in the langauge doesnt count. Yes I hired a tutor afterwards but for writing. Speaking was already at the needed level thanks to a few hundred hours of listening and there wasnt much of improvement perhaps a bit of confidence. Writing was a different story.So I dont agree speaking with people is so high above all the other methods. Of course it is great but not such a miracle.Right now Ive been in a foreign country for a few months. My speaking has been very good from the beginning no wonder considering my C exam but I am still too far from perfection for my taste and I havent improved at all since my arrival I still have accent I still make mistakes here and there I still sound less natural than the natives. And I spend lots of time using the language with natives every day. And my previous experience with other languages shorter than this one though and lower level in those langauges suggest that the preparation and studies back at home especially listening are the most important part of the process. Yes talking with natives helps especially at the intermediate level. But there are far too many people these days who believe too much that they can learn a language efficiently with a few apps and then just talking. There are tons of expats who have been using the language of their new country for years and yet speak horribly. Dont get me wrong. The whole hype around Benny the Irish Polyglot is good as it encourages people to speak more just like you. That is a good thing. But the other side of the coin are two problems people underestimate the importance of studying and many turn lack of available natives into excuses.Really if I got an euro every time someone with much less experience and lower skills questions my studying and says just talk and talk my home library would be twice as big D,languagelearning,db7i3zj,2,t5_2rjsc

But as we moved to Shanghainese Cantonese Hokkien speakers not only was the pronunciation different but each one remarked when they would not say what was written for them to read because in their regional languages what had been written in Standard Chinese was literary for them.I started to learn Cantonese briefly but I havent had time or motivation to continue.

10153936,0,t3_5l9o35,I took a Switzerland and its Languages course in university. Some fun facts Theres an awkward imbalance between learning a Romance in Switzerland and learning German. The French spoken in Geneva is more or less the same as the French spoken in Paris and taught in schools. The German spoken in Zurich is very different from the German taught in schools. This means that someone taking German classes will have more trouble communicating with Germanspeaking Swiss than someone taking French would have communicating with Frenchspeaking Swiss. As with most officially multilingual countries theres some drama. Every once in a while a Germanspeaking canton will propose prioritizing English over the Romance languages in schools. Then everyone snaps at each other for a while. Also Switzerland has a lot of referendums and occasionally the votes will be divided on linguistic grounds. Romantsch is usually presented as one language because that allows Romantschspeakers to group together and negotiate with the federal government as a united mass. On the ground it consists of four to five dialects depending on how you count then plus a standard that no one speaks natively and is just barely tolerated by the locals. One Romantsch dialect Sursilvan is the only Romance language to have the German verbsecond word order.,languagelearning,dbv06t4,4,t5_2rjsc

For one Spanish is also a good language to learn for business but people barely learn Spanish to even a conversational level and now they wanna learn Chinese a language completely different from English?? And since English is THE international language nowadays it will be no surprise to see Chinese kids learning English. Now the ordinary folk in China might not know English but a youngster might know some. If the youngster is from a rich family heshe has mostly likely been enrolled in pricey English classes aka very good ones and have even studied abroad.

10500832,0,t1_dcycs8l,I havent used Lingvist so I cant really comment but I tend to think that vocabulary building time will never be more than a single leg of a solid plan. Youll still need real active production practice talking writing reading practice and listening practice plus a little extra work to shore up grammar depending on the test. I suppose what I really meant to impart to OP... no one that needs hand holding can expect to go from  to C in German in the amount of time he has available. If its possible at all its going to take some pretty carefully crafted scheduling. Anki or memrise or lingvist maybe could have a place in a plan like that but if you dont know what youre doing its easy to just spend the time without actually hitting what you need. On the other hand for those of us just learning for fun without a strict harsh schedule Im a big fan of learning in the ways you enjoy enough to stick with. Sounds like Lingvist has been working for you so thats awesome!

Backgroundwise I have a very similar storyI am  years old and I took French classes in high school over  years ago now. I took a trip to Costa Rica with my fianc in late May early June . Hes fluent in Spanish and it was awesome to see him interact with the locals who were friendly and spoke English but were far more happy when communicating in Spanish. At the end of the trip my fianc suggested that I pick up French again because I always wanted to relearn it but would lose motivation when just watching YouTube videos.So this is when I said Ok Im doing this for REAL now! I downloaded every free app I could get my hands on and I was on my way.... I too set a goal of being fluentish exact word at the time in a year. Since then I have translated that to about C level.Its been  months and I am so happy not only with my progress but with the genuine love I have for the French language and the beauty I have found in it.  Not to mention the awesome people Ive met and befriended along the way. I think Im at about a B level now.

10746031,0,t3_5tdia7,As dmbf said probably a personal code or language.  If no one on reddit can identify this language then its doubtful its a language with millions of speakers.  It may not have necessarily been a code the writer invented either but if it were a conlangpersonal code chances are it is.  In th grade I created my own code so that people wouldnt snoop on things I wrote and I still use it to this day.  Of course its far less intricate than this script.  This script looks like a lot of work was put into it.  Someone could possibly do frequency analysis but it will take out time to suss out the individual characters and thats assuming its even an alphabet as opposed to syllabary representing english.,languagelearning,ddoddp9,2,t5_2rjsc
10759329,0,t3_5tceq6,I would recommend immersing yourself in German casually but actively studying Italian. You can still maintain and learn German because you have the experience that allows you a point of access to German in casual forms movies video games books. I usually read the news play video games and read books in French and Spanish but I am actively learning Chinese. I dont lose French because Im absorbing information through my hobbies despite the fact that Im not currently studying. The important thing is that you maintain exposure to the language and if you fall out of practice and find Italian taking up too much of your time you could lose a lot of German. It is like playing a musical instrument you can definitely get rusty but thats if you completely switch from one to the other. In such cases if I ever feel that my French is waning I can just refresh some things. I find that the more you refresh the deeper it becomes lodged in your brain. And no  I dont think German would interfere with your ability to understand Italian grammar. They are much too different for that and I really encourage you to learn a third language so that you experience and gain knowledge of that difference  consciously learning and speaking two languages from two different language families.,languagelearning,ddpqud4,2,t5_2rjsc

10863870,0,t1_de0imc5,Of course! Anki is an SRS flashcard software. Ive only been using it for a few months but Ive been referencing this persons comment which I think is really useful That comment is also where I got the phrase abstract vocabulary. I dont know how that person in particular uses the phrase but for me I use it to refer to words that are hard to translate usually this maps to abstract concepts. For instance a while ago I was reading a text about health in industrialized countries. Words like virus stroke plasma etc. would be concrete it refers to a specific thing which is easily recognizable while a word like  zuzhi translates roughly to prevent or obstruct... but you can already tell that prevent and obstruct have different connotations to them. Those are in my opinion harder to learn because if you were to try and make a list of qualities of the word e.g. prevent is for something that hasnt happened yet and has a neutral tone obstruct has a negative connotation itd be a lot to remember and not very helpful in using the words. Ive learned to study those words mainly from context like the person in the linked comment. And although the examples I gave were of nouns vs. verbs thats not always the case! For instance think of trying to describe the difference between state condition and situation. If you already know how to put them into sentences learning how to spell words like that is comparatively much much easier.,languagelearning,de0j54j,6,t5_2rjsc

That said its use in Ethiopia would be minimal and basically negligible. Swahili does not exist in an official capacity in that country. That country already has its own lingua francaAmharicwith which at least in the capital one should expect to be able to converse with the ethnic Amharas Oromos Somalis etc..Africa is not a monolith and even its traditional quadrants or quintants of North Africa West Africa East Africa Central Africa and South Africapurposed for language grouping in our caseare very nuanced. Youd get the most use out of Swahili in Kenya Tanzania and Eastern Congo honestly. Even in nations like Rwanda which recently fitted it to be an official language its use is rather limited. Im not trying to be a downer but how much Swahili will export itself as the lingua franca of all of East Africa remains to be seen.My point is that that might one day change as can be seen by Rwanda adopting Swahili to their language pantheon. It has the potential to displace other bridge languages in the region and disperse through most of East AfricaI just wouldnt count on Ethiopia taking it on.

11055067,0,t3_5xuwp5,If your goal is listening and reading you should be spending most of your time on listening and reading. Erste Stufe is a great german graded reader theres a torrent on the pirate site with  german graded readers with Audio... nothing against Duolingo but I found it was only helpful for the first  of the tree at most after that it kind of fell apart. If youre going to use a program to help with gaining new vocab memrise or Anki would be better. Within  months of an hour a day Id gone through a few graded readers and read the first one or two Harry Potter books. Listening was still a huge challenge watching media or following conversations only started to be doable after maybe  months. Conversation only started to open up after a year or more of work like that but given that I was exclusively working on passive understanding thats kind of to be expected. When it comes to podcasts and moviesvideos and so on I only found value when I was able to follow the bulk of what I was listening to. Others might have had a different experience but trying to pick out words from a mess of confusing German isnt the best use of your time in my opinion. I learned so I could read and watch media Ive more than met that goal and Im pleased with my study methods. Its kind of a top heavy approach though it takes quite a while before it starts being generally functional. You might want to at least supplement with a handmade Anki deck of phrases you know youll want to use so youll have something to fall back on while youre actually there. Check out Fluent Forever if you havent yet theres some good ideas on approaching that style of learning. If you like to read and that really is your  main goal by  pages read I found I was starting to get very comfortable with the language. Ive heard others use that metric too I think its a good one.

Get literature or magazines in Russian and work on translating them. I assume that most of your issue is vocabulary and not grammar so reading a lot of authentic materials will help you build up vocabulary. The advanced textbooks will help you hone in on any nuances in grammar you may be missing but make sure you skim the textbook before buying it because first theyre usually pretty expensive and second you want to make sure that its not too easy.

On the one hand there are the diehard folow the principle of self created cards and on the other some casual users who just want to use the tool without reading thinking or planning. Right now it seems to me the first group uses anki while the second uses memrise. I kinda feel lost in the middle of the two sometimes DI dont think Damien wants to compete with memrise or tinycards in any way. I dont think attracting as much users as possible is his priority.

It has a format similar to the iTalki Notebook feature  you can submit much longer entries and they have a good change of getting corrected by multiple people. Im guessing that HiNative earns them more money since in order to gain certain perks and have your questions seen by more people you have to pay monthly for it.

Correcting a childs speech of grammar in particular generally doesnt work.There is controversy over whether there is a language faculty or not Chomskyans vs. others but the evidence is that language acquisition is something children do instinctively and on a predictable timetable see link above. I doubt any research will show that your method actually had any affect on your childs language development.

There are  dialects in total about  of which are still spoken today. My wife same ethnic group as me grew up in a village where she went to school but the language they used was not Circassian and she also speaks the prestige dialect perfectly. For what its worth this is in contrast to members of my family born in the US who attended school and speak English in a manner that would probably lead many to think of them as being uneducated. Interesting side note my parents grew up in the Middle East and Arabic was their second language. They never received grammatical instruction and they speak Arabic fluently. In the US my mom went to school but my dad never did and I dont think anyone would ever pick up on the fact that either of them are from outside the US. Forgetting their grammar their accents are pretty American.My wife grew up in the North Caucasus of the Soviet Union now Russia and grew up in a Jewish enclave.

11267643,0,t3_60ssof,I misunderstood the meaning of the post as well.As a native French speaker let me add my grain of salt. I have two explanations for this phenomenon. They are probably not the only reasons but I am pretty sure they are at least a part of the picture.First reason French people are very conservative when it comes to their language. I think most of the people would consider written language as the correct and beautiful one and spoken language as the natural one. French society is very reluctant to any change made to spelling grammar or even the way grammar is taught at school. So the fact that written language is seen as the correct one and that French hate change made to its language make it slower to evolve it does evolve but a lot slower than spoken language. It is impossible to stop a spoken language to evolve but it is a lot easier to slow the evolution of a written language this explains some differences between spoken and written language.Second reason We have this thing called Acadmie Franaise French Academy which is a group of people trying to dictate the correct way to speakwrite French. Of course they have not much influence on the way people talk. But a lot of French people actually see them as the authority and follow their guidelines when it comes to written French and sometimes even spoken French. Ill be a bit blunt but the Acadmie Franaise is basically a bunch of elderly men trying to shove their opinions on what a correctbeautiful language is into other peoples throats. Their recommendations are often outdated and absolutely arbitrary.,languagelearning,df965ke,71,t5_2rjsc

Sardinian turns out to be the closest with some pretty incredible examples of retained features for instance  the sound k before i and e never underwent palatalization as it did in all other romance languages so Sardinian maintains the hard pronunciation of Latin ce and ci.
