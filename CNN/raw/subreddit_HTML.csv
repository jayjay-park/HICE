1395483,0,t3_2a3ora,First find a web host. There are many and everyone will have their preferred host. I use the Value plan from www.lithiumhosting.com and I pay . per month to have them host my site and any associated files. I host my personal site which I pretty much only use for job interviews so I dont worry about having a lot of bandwidth or space. I imagine you might have similar needs.Typically when you create a hosting account youll be offered the opportunity to register your domain name at the same time. I recommend doing this. It will cost approximately  per year to own your domain name and youll be notified when its expiring each year so you can renew it. Assuming your chosen domain name is available the cost will typically vary based on the top level domain .com .net .us .biz etc... When registering your domain name you can type what you want and the service will tell you if its available.After youve registered for hosting and set up a domain name youll be able to transfer your files. Most web host companies will send you a nice welcome email with your account info. Youll typically get FTP access to upload your files to a specified directory along with access to the backend of your site typically provided through an GUI called Cpanel. Cpanel will let you manage your webmail accounts databases security and all other aspects of your site. If you dont have a FTP client I strongly suggest FileZilla which is free. I use Notepad to edit my site code and it also has a built in FTP client but I prefer to use FileZilla.When you have your files ready you upload them to the www folder on your host server making sure to name the home page index.html. When you go to your site index.html will be the page that loads by default. In addition to that file upload any other web pages images CSS files and JavaScript files. Be sure to keep everything organized when uploading because youll need to change the URLs for the various script links and image links. Right now they probably point to locations on your local computer but youll need to update them to match their location on the server.Remember to take advantage of free email accounts and register an email address or two for yourself on your domain. Its pretty cool having an email address of yournameyoursite.com. It also looks really impressive for your resume assuming your site or domain name is not some embarrassing thing or something you dont want a potential employer to see.,HTML,cir7dqe,18,t5_2r6cd

2353389,0,t1_cm2fh1z,I guess there are two things that my be problematic. Using tables for layout is usually not done anymore. Tables should be used to order data. Layouts are usually done using divs and CSS. Divs are more powerful and reserving tables for data helps machines understand your webpage. The latter is good for search engines and screen readers.. I dont think that iframes are that common anymore if you control both the outer and the inner webpage. Iframes are still used to embed external sites such as a custom google map. If the content is not external then you can integrate it seamlessly using a dynamic webpage either on the server for example with PHP or in the browser using JavaScript and loading data with AJAX.The former is something you should look into soon. Layouts using divs are very versatile and powerful. You could also look into frameworks that provide a starting point such as bootstrap.The latter is also very helpful but requires looking into server side languages and databases and into JavaScript if you use AJAX to dynamically load content into a displayed page. This makes more sense as soon as you feel comfortable with HTML and CSS.,HTML,cm2l8rj,3,t5_2r6cd

In the Console tab you will see Failed to load resource the server responded with a status of  Not Found and   Same with the other description image.  Make sure youve correctly uploaded and linked to those assets.With regards to the black border I believe its appearing because those image assets are broken.  If you use the console to edit as html and start removing layers you get down to a layer thats just the broken image.  So the black border is not actually a border around your div or anything its just the broken image border.,HTML,coz8n9k,4,t5_2r6cd

You could give your Resume Redevelopment a css style of clearleft to fix this but make sure that it wont screw up the view at a different window size. ,HTML,dajcnsn,1,t5_2r6cd
