4124105,0,t3_37wk4q,Centurylink in my area the way it works is they split a Mbit line and use Mbit for VideoTV and Mbit for the internet. Im not sure if they can or will allow you to get the full Mbit as internet. I cant recall what they do with the voice down here. SIPs?VOIP? ltshruggtIt sounds like even going with a business plan isnt worth it. Comcast or other cable provider will likely give you more bang for the same buck. TMobile for example on a G connection regularly hits around Mbit down and about Mbit varies up in my experience here. Comcast consistently gives me about Mbit up and Mbit down on an Extreme  plan. The latency is generally good. YMMV depending on where you live though.I would look into alternatives very seriously. The service you have and pay for isnt even considered broadband by the low standards set by the federal government.gt In the United States the Federal Communications Commission FCC reflecting advances in technology market offerings by broadband providers and consumer demand updated its broadband benchmark speeds to  megabits per second Mbps for downloads and  Mbps for uploads.,centurylink,crqdfqu,1,t5_308fz
5572540,0,t3_3qlqzi,yes its everywhere but its very rarely enforced on higher speed tiers.  its noted on their page i usually average  GB a month... for several months.

9425595,0,t3_59q2xj,There was a software update a while ago that bricked hundreds upon hundreds of these boxes. The error code  indicates a hard drive failure in the dvr itself. I have no idea who they contracted with for drives but they fail constantly. ,centurylink,d9arc5k,1,t5_308fz

10738063,0,t3_5tmk56,I know forsure that  is blocked by CL  might be as well this is with their DHCP assigned internet service.  If you have PPPoE then  is open.To get around that Ive configured my router to accept traffic on  it then forwards that traffic to the IP listening on .  Its not ideal but it works around what they are blanket blocking.,centurylink,ddnjtdf,3,t5_308fz
