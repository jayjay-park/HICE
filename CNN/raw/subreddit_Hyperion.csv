166005,0,t3_1vz705,Oh wow I wasnt too much interested in watching it dont know why the trailer didnt convince me much I guess but now I think I no longer have excuses not to see it.,Hyperion,cexca80,5,t5_2s6op

7455066,0,t3_3u80dd,Yes a bit unnecessary.  I would have thought that every time a new planet was visited the gravity was almost always mentioned this would be enough of a descriptor besides comparing how lapis the sky was or wasnt.  ,Hyperion,d2pldui,1,t5_2s6op
8054543,0,t3_4pisiy,I dont recall anyone mentioning a precise date beyond either pre or post Hegira in The Fall Of Hyperion. Theres a short aside on the different faiths. Not very helpful I know but why do you ask?,Hyperion,d4lenf6,2,t5_2s6op
8253191,0,t1_d0zn90r,Have you read The Culture series by Iain Banks?  Its not quite the same and the series is more disjointed rather than one contiguous story at least so far as I am into it but Im getting a lot of the same tingly excitement and intrigue feelings from it.,Hyperion,d597dqe,1,t5_2s6op
10436427,0,t1_dcr1781,I thought how he discussed the aftermath was done well. How it effected different people in different ways. And the end to Gladstones story. It was really quite moving. Really interested in moving on to the other two books at some point. ,Hyperion,dcr1eof,7,t5_2s6op

10962695,0,t3_5wk5vt,Rachmaninoff is referenced in the very beginning. The Consul is playing it on the piano. Its the first sentence of the whole series actually. ,Hyperion,deaq3mo,3,t5_2s6op
