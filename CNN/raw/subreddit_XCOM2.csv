6537707,0,t3_44zwmx,I assumed the first one was scripted but I dunno I wasnt paying attention when I triggered it I think I accidentallydeliberately flew into it.  We tried evasive maneuvers but they failed.  I was about...  months into the game?  So I had some soldiers ranked up to Lieutenant which helped a lot in the defense mission.In fact even though I was down to  fully healthy soldiers due to some incredibly unlucky timing I utterly destroyed the defense mission playing on Normal difficulty the game is too buggy and the mechanics too different to risk higher or Ironman imo.  I had a Ranger with the ability to stay in concealment when the rest of the squad is revealed so I had that Ranger approach the EMP spike thing until they could see it and sniped the thing right from the landing ramp with my Lieutentant level Sharpshooter with Squadsight killed it in three or  shots with the Tier  sniper rifle.  In the mean time I set up all my soldiers with heavy cover it was a wooded area set them to Overwatch as often as possible and maneuvered to always keep the incoming reinforcements in front of my forces keeping my other sniper using Longshot Overwatch.  All Tier  armor and weapons fighting aliens ranging up to Vipers and sword guys and maybe a couple MECs half my troops were wounded some quite badly before the mission even started and I didnt lose a single one and no reloads.  In fact it was probably my proudest moment so far in the game.As to avoiding the event entirely I had the option to take a mission that would have removed the pursuing UFO but that was the only mention I saw of it before it showed up.

The modded weapon then appears as an option when trying to equip a weapon on another soldier.Also there is an X in the corner of the weapon slot which when clicked will just equip the highest tech weapon possible without any mods. That X is visible by moving the mouse over the currently equipped weapon I think.I play without mods so one thing I do to unequip weapons is go to the equip menu and then use the arrows to move from soldier to soldier until I see green parts on the weapon model.

Rangers are forest green with secondary black for melee specialists and brown for infiltrators  Snipers are black with black for sharpshooters and navy blue for pistoleers.  Grenadiers are red with the demo techs using green and the support ones using black  Specialists are opposite because the secondary color is the shared and the primary marks specialization. Secondary is red using white for medics and orange for hackers. I like the way the medics look better this way than with my other scheme.    PsiOps is purple.

10122746,0,t3_5kssle,The game offers respecing resetting skillsperks after a certain rank for the cost of  days and I think this is the way you should play this. For example early on youd want your rangers to take as much conceal as they can youd want them go sword rather than shotgun better aim on swords early on but as the game progresses and you get higher ranks unlock more skills youd want things changed .. suddenly swords suck when you get to mechanized units conceal is still great for scouting but you really need that thth guy to deal damage not just stand there and watch others sweating... Same goes with specialists  first youd want full healer but once you get good upgrades  better armor better weapons you might pull out flawlesslow casualties so youd want more hackingrobotic control than healing... Snipers cant really be jack of all trades  depending on the mission youd want either pure sniper or pure gunner  if you have plenty of time like supply raid missions youd want to put your sniper high ground and make it rain havoc from far away. If youre doing VIP extraction then you cant afford guy stuck on the first building on the other side of the extraction point... Snipers are easy to rank because they have lots of killing potential  having  different snipers shouldnt be so hard.Grenadiers are.. well... very nice.. Bombs can help you a lot their aim is not much at the beginning so you should have two full grenadiers that can bomb the sh!t out of enemies and their cover. Once they get higher rank you might actually start using their weapon but at the beginning they cant hit sh!t leave that for sniper or close range ranger. Once you get PSI OPS.... well... These guys are the whole other level...  months after youve built PSI Lab you have an OP character... As  for the perks  TAKE THEM ALLLLLL!!!!!,XCOM2,dbr011q,4,t5_38gcp
10155558,0,t3_5le4z7,Magus Psi Operatives make it quite easy. Also having a pure sharpshooter with a spider suit will allow you just mow down enemies on the last level. There are lots of elevated positions but with free reloads and expanded mags on the sniper it becomes a slaughter with Killzone and the chain shot sniper ability.Also YOLOing with Rangers shotguns with untouchable and swords makes it even easier as there are no mechanical enemies in the last portion of the mission. Your avatar should be MCing the crap out of the Andromedons and is almost a cheating unit.Hugely depends on play style but MY Colonel Sniper was MVP on the last mission for me. Congrats and I hope it was a gratifying game and accomplishment.,XCOM2,dbv6tc0,2,t5_38gcp

I bet those phantom rangers could be mighty effective.Man back in the XCOM Terror From The Deep days my aquanauts would always fall to melee attacks  crushed by lobsterman pincers slashed by calcinite claws etc.  So when XCOM said I could have a guy who automatically meleeattacks anybody who comes near him I said yes please this guy every time.     ,XCOM2,dc7acsv,3,t5_38gcp
10280588,0,t3_5n7t5k,Get rookies early earn supplies from getting more countries and bigger monthly pay rather than supply drops if you can get through regular missions then the scripted ones are easy enough. Just take more time and pick the enemy off one by one.,XCOM2,dc9d07t,2,t5_38gcp

I found commander to be pretty tough until midgame but then it did get easier Veteran is already easy after just a couple of hoursmag weapons plated armour unlocked psionics so Im giving up.

10605825,0,t1_dd9wljo,Youll want to play through vanilla first usually since LW feels a lot harder.Then again LW for the most part feels like a totally different game so it might not really matter what to play first  might as well get used to the LW mechanics right from the start.That all being said you should definitely give it a try since it is a great mod and if you dont enjoy the changes you can allways go back to playing Vanilla.,XCOM2,dd9wrfe,3,t5_38gcp
10605976,0,t1_dd9nz99,I disagree with your lessons learned. Those fights are about keeping the enemy at arms length so assaults are too risky. They end up being a cheap singletarget flashbang every couple turns.  Heavies are optimized for this great at range.  Supports are bad at clearing enemies. With a long fight you get overwhelmed by sheer numbers.  Bruteforcing with AoE damage seems more efficient. Advent runs out of decent cover spots quickly and stack up inevitably.  Forget about loot is great advice though.,XCOM2,dd9xbki,2,t5_38gcp
