She is dying and rheagor just abandons her doubtful. Got. Bran chapter . He stood there magnificent radiant and bedazziling he shone surrounded by tall elegant plants slender and tall. Across the dimly lit room there she lay admist a sea of blood and a handful of hay. The tears in his eyes soon started to  subside his love of his life his heart and his soul the tower of joy girl or a boy . He knew at this moment he had to leave the boots and the toil marching ever closer still to ever pending doom and disaster would she be saved the hope still shone but in truth she turned into a Panda......                                         .

8106506,0,t1_d4r4vpr,I do think though that Arya will be involved in the death of Cersei as Aryas list contains Gregor Clegane the main guard to Cersei. Maybe She and Jamie will work together to get Cersei alone and then Jamie will kill Cersei and Arya will kill Gregor. ,gottheories,d4r8sll,2,t5_31sk0
8136518,0,t3_4qd101,I agree with what the others said I dont think Jamie would be killed off screen. I think it would be interesting though if Arya did kill Cersei as Jamie in one of the next two seasons. ,gottheories,d4uma4w,1,t5_31sk0

When it becomes in his interest to split the North and the Vale I think hell do so. Remember at this point LF is the only one who has any influence over Robbinspelling? so what the Vale would do after LFs death is kind of an unknown. Maybe someone could usurp the lordship of the Vale? That would be cool.,gottheories,d5h1a3k,1,t5_31sk0
