You could stick yourself over and over again with the needle and never feel it because of how thin it is. The pain comes from the actual injection of the medication. The reason the pen hurts if it hurts is because its injecting the medication very quickly. With the syringe you get to control the flow so you control the pain. Its sort of like ripping off a bandaid you can either go really slow and the pain is less but it takes a while or you can just rip it off really quick for that short burst of pain that only lasts a very short while.Actually the bandaid analogy is almost spot on.

It sucks badly no other way to describe it. Its so unfortunate that this isnt a disease where they know the cause and all you have to do is avoid gluten.That being said while everyone is different I personally feel from my experience nutrition is the biggest factor stress. Ive thought about going gluten free but Ive never really noticed that being a problem for me. The biggest thing I avoid are raw vegetables which sucks cuz I love salads. I always flared up when my immune system was shot usually after a week of binge drinking yes I am a fucking idiot and dont learn. I eat healthy cook take probiotics when I can and take the supplements that help with the immune system. All and all I feel you can get the upper hand if you take care of your immune system and watch your diet but unfortunately that isnt a cure and isnt a sure thing. Congrats to you.

Prednisone still works but not as a remission drug just as a treatment drug for a flare. Currently Im on Tysabri which has worked out quite effectively again for Crohns not UC at least for the time being since it is in a separate family of drugs from Humira Cimzia and Remicade.In the past Methotrexate has also worked for me both as a maintenance drug and as a drug to help push me towards remission. As ECE said you can always do surgery for UC but I imagine that might be a more last resort option for you.I hope I was able to help at least somewhat if you have any questions please dont hesitate to ask.,CrohnsDisease,chxwqj7,2,t5_2s453

I really do sympathise with the mood swings theyre terrible However  the one occasion that my doctor would not mutually agree my treatment with me was when I needed to take prednisone and I didnt want to. It was the one time when he told me straightforwardly that I HAD to take it to control the inflammation or I would end up in hospital instead and he wouldnt take no for an answer. He was really concerned for me. Before you disregard your doctors advice make sure you know the risks and discuss alternatives before you stop taking your pills. Also I know your kids dont deserve a raging parent but they also dont deserve an absent parent through an avoidable hospital stay.

I have heard lots of complaints from people that their doctors will not except the covered california blue shield. Im just barely young enough to still be on my parents insurance but I have even had trouble with that over the years. While I do not know how to fix your conundrum I do have some suggestions.. Try the website for her insurance they often have a list available of providers who accept the insurance on their website. In fact Im pretty sure that by law they have to tell you who accepts their insurance. In the future a PPO is so much easier to use when you need to see specialists. It may cost more but the convenience alone is worth it to me. . Ask for referrals from a primary care they may have a better idea of who takes your insurance.. Many insurances will pay for you to see outofnetwork providers especially if you cannot find one that is in network in your area.. Dont give up hope.

The preparation for it is the worst part.Until then try keeping a food diary  record what you eat amp how you felt each day.

2836502,0,t1_cnqbsq1,Hey there!  and had UC for  years and just got in remission about  months ago as I had been flairing since diagnosis. Like DilapidatedEmu suggested with bananas and white bread are great I was on what they call a low residue low fiber diet which does help which is basically a very low fiber diet without any whole grains. I have a pdf that actually has a list of things to eat and things to stay away from I can email you if you want! Something that I dealt with as well was very low potasium so thats where bananas come in and even a multi vitamin even! Also something that helps with prednisone use is vitamin D as it helps with some of the side effects from pred use! Like above I have had a more difficult than usual case so I have been on a bundle of drugs and can help with what to expect from them like pred for a year and a half Azathioprine mp remicade salofalk and pentassa. Im guessing you already know to stay away from booze and nsaids like asprin as it thins your blood and can cause some probs also I was told to avoid using imodium too much as it can cause problems as well for people with UC called toxic mega colon which sounds like a movie made by the guys that made sharknado but its pretty serious apparently! small meals through the day tend to be better for me as it prevents any large stresses on the large intestine. Keep your phone charged so you can play games on the toilet its a great chance to get some highscores in brick breaker!Caffeine is bad because it is a diuretic and might make things worse for ya as well. As suggested too its actually better to stay on some kind of med that helps keep you in check and hopefully its one that doesnt have many side effects and just acts as a maintenance drug!SOrry for the wall of text but I remember when I first got diagnosed I just wanted to devour as much info about it as possible and know as many tricks to try and make it as bearable as possible until you can get into a remission!

2901595,0,t3_2tczb1,Hi welcome.Ive been on Remicade so I can give some insight.  Im not sure where you are getting your information but most people dont have any bad side effects from Remicade.  Personally I looked forward to infusion day because it meant I would feel better I never really stop flaring and I would get an awesome nap I received benedryl with each infusion.  If your flares are intermittent you have a big advantage.  However even a short flare can cause permanent damage which leads to blockages and strictures which can only be fixed with surgery usually.  The advantage that meds like Remicade and Humira have over the other options is that they can specifically healprevent the damage that is permanent.  If you do have Crohns you will need to get used to taking meds or following a diet or such even when you are feeling good.  Once you have things under control you can work with your doctor to find the minimal amount of meds you need to stay healthy.  But you are better off doing maintenance than betting that the next flare wont be a lot worse or last a lot longer.Sorry this is getting kind of fire and brimstone.  I guess Im trying to say that you have options as it sounds like you have a mild case.  The presence of the blockage is probably why your doc wants to use the big guns since that is the biggest cause for concern.,CrohnsDisease,cnxx12g,8,t5_2s453

One of the tricky things with c diff is once its in the environment it can turn into spores that are very very difficult to kill and can live in the environment for months.  So people can get c diff infection recover then reingest the spores from the environment and wind up sick again. Regular household cleaners also dont kill the spores they are hardy little bastards of course. Washing your hands with soap and water alcohol doesnt kill the spores you need to actually remove them from your hands using friction and water and cleaning everything you can especially your bathroom with gt bleach are probably what will help you best. Take your abx as prescribed and talk to your doc to ensure all your meds are totally necessary ie antireflux drugs are also linked with c diff...Hope the vanco gets you better soon. ,CrohnsDisease,cq2o26g,2,t5_2s453

A GI nurse got me an appointment with a new doctor in a few weeks. If you ever need to go to the ER it is a good idea to phone your nurse on the way.

These arent loans or short  year programs. These are indefinite accounts that are limited to a certain amount of money every year. Along with my insurance the RemiStart subsidy plan I am enrolled in has me paying literally nothing for my Remicade. Another thing you might look into is private practices vs. hospitals. Hospitals will charge you almost double the amount youd pay at a private practice for some medications. That being said... some private practices are run better than others so buyer beware.I went the first two years of having this disease without getting a diagnosis or medication and it was a living nightmare.

5216581,0,t3_3mesmo,Ive been on Humira for around four years but am switching to Remicade because of fatigue issues. There are two ways you can inject pen or syringe.The pens are faster and easier but do have a reputation for stinging they also changed them a couple of years back to require more pressure to trigger which ruined them as far as I am concerned.With the syringes you inject yourself manually but the needle is short and it gives you complete control which allows you to minimize any pain.I switched to the syringes for a few months and definitely recommend that option if the pens are causing pain. The only downside to the syringe is that people who have trouble with needles will have trouble with the manual steps required. If you have someone else to give you the injections however it is definitely the better way to go.,CrohnsDisease,cvesgtj,1,t5_2s453

5407636,0,t1_cw1xl6i,Yeah that is exactly what has happened to be honest. I started Humira over  years ago and initially was on MG every  weeks. Then when I developed Crohns derived Arthritis I had my dose increased to mg weekly along with adding weekly Methotrexate injections. While on both of the injections I was also put on Prednisone mg daily. Eventually I started to gain some bad side effects from the Prednisone so I was switched to Medrol and have been on that since. I was switched to Cimzia  weeks ago and had  doses of that. After a month of being on it I was taken off of it being that it did not work for me and I was switched back to Humira as I was getting worse. My doctor wanted to bring me back to baseline shitty before he changed around the Humira once more. I was not happy with the treatment I was receiving. I do not believe that the way I am feeling cant change. I also find it very hard to believe that the combination of medications that I am on now is the ONLY route for me and my disease. So I took it upon myself to do some research and found a doctor in NYC I live in NY so its not that far for me that specializes in my specific type of Arthritis. So I made an appt with him. It took him maybe  seconds for him to change me off of Humira and switch me onto Remicade. He actually laughed at my other doctor because he was so appalled at how he was treating me as a patient.So now I have to wait  weeks to have the Humira leave my system and once that happens I can start my first infusion of the Remicade.TLDR On Humira  years lost efficacy and I gained new symptoms it was no longer treating. CImzia had no positive effect on me so was switched back to Humira and then switched to Remicade per the new doctors orders.,CrohnsDisease,cw2vwj3,1,t5_2s453

While it hurts going in after a few hours I typically adjusted to the pressure and sometimes it just didnt feel like it was in there anymore.

5716051,0,t3_3teiya,gtThey also spoke of maybe needing to go directly on remicade or a biologic.Just my opinion. I am not a doctor let alone a GI doctor. Just a guy who had UC for  years and got his colon removed a month ago. When you are dealing with this disease you have four different levels of drugs. Level one is steroids. They will get yuo feeling better faster and they start working the quickest. They usually get you on steroids to reduce the inflammation. Level two are drugs like asacol and lialda. These drugs take a little longer to start working and will usually start to work once it is time to taper off the steroids. Level three drugs like imuran and cellcept take longer to work than the level two drugs. These drugs are immune suppressants. They have some notable side effects and are used in transplant patients. Level four drugs are the biologics.  Remicade Humira and the new entyvio. These drugs are expensive and at least among ALL the GI doctors I have talked to a last step before surgical options are explored. Arm yourself with information. Does your GU doctor want to put you on a biologic and you get it infused in their office? Make sure you ask about trying some of the level  drugs before you go full nuclear unless your disease is so bad that it requires biologics from the get go. Most importantly is finding out which one you have. Very similar disease in some aspects but long term they are worlds apart. ,CrohnsDisease,cx5mrfj,1,t5_2s453

6990490,0,t3_4bc9q9,Hello! Have had Crohns myself for about  years. As for diet definitely follow some suggestions from the low fodmap diet as others have said. When I am flaring I cut out caffeine all processed sugar alcohol and limit carbs as much as possible. Mainly I will eat eggs yogurt fruit meat usually chicken and well cooked veggies.I was on remicade for three years. It worked well getting me into remission. Thankfully no bad reactions but it would make me horribly tired and foggy minded for several days or a week after infusion. I suggest using remicade only as a last resort to avoid surgery. You can not stopstart remicade without risk of a serious reaction so once you start youre on it indefinitely.If youre open to it I highly suggest trying medical marijuana as a maintainance med if you can access it. I use high CBD strains and it significantly increases my quality of life and is great for managing symptoms. When I first started using it years ago during a flare it decreased my bowl movements from  per day to . Now Im remission and when my intestine get that writhingtwisting irritation going on it stops it almost immediately. Its a great complimentary medicine.,CrohnsDisease,d18ppuo,1,t5_2s453

I also knew someone who took Imuran during pregnancy and was fine  hell she participated in a university study about taking it while pregnant and they did a battery of tests on her baby after to see what effects it had.

The rest is just flat out down to how people handle it. One thing I would suggest is making it as psychologically uneventful as possible. Act like its normal nothing really to discuss.

8816518,0,t1_d77evrs,The criticisms are valid and do at least temper a conclusion of does not support because the data provided do provide limited support for map to be a cause of symptoms. Antimap treatment according to the protocols used provided a significant benefit at  weeks that later fell off.   Thats what happens if you underdose antibiotics.  They work for a while and then stop working.  When you consider that the trial used what the practitioners who were prescribing those antibiotics considered subtherapeutic the outcome is exactly what would be expected if it were MAP.Is there any evidence of what doses were considered therapeutic before the study?  I would be much more convinced that Borody is a quack if he was advocating for the doses used in the study and only started claiming those doses were too low after he learned of the results and then upped the dosage he recommended.   I wouldnt be totally convinced.  The fact that other primates get Crohns symptoms from MAP would be very hard evidence to overcome in my mind.  Although if someone came up evidence that refuted a role of MAP in primate Johnes disease I would be more receptive.But whatever the paper says it is cited in discussions such as this to shut down discussion on the topic.  This single study didnt provide enough evidence that treating MAP helps patients long term so anyone who thinks this might be helpful is an antiscience idiot regardless of what other data exist.gt Either way its interesting that all the critics of the Selby study seem to know how to run a better randomized placebo controlled trial for antiMAP therapy and yet none of them ever do one themselves.Running one of these trials is very expensive as Im sure you know.  And the return on investment for any therapy involving just standard antibiotics for which generics exist is sure to be low.  Who is going to fund the study?  It looks to me like Borody came up with a novel solution for that.  He patented a particular combination of generically available antibiotics.  Now maybe its not actually novel but Ive never heard of anything like it.  It looks to me like Borody managed to come up with a way that actual trials could be funded. HermanTaylor did the same but through a more obviously patentable and much higher risk method.  No one has been successful with any mycobacterium vaccine as far as I know so the risk may be even greater than it sounds.gt At least not until right now when their respective products are developed.This along with the previous quote sound to me like you are simultaneously accusing Borody and HermanTaylor of avoiding an actual trial because they know it will fail and delaying trials because they couldnt yet make enough money.  Are you accusing them of something or is this just an example of what I heard about how Glenn Beck raped and murdered that girlgt Theres no point in talking about any therapy in stage I because the majority dont end up going anywhere.That was my point.  You mentioned there is no big push at Digestive Diseases Week for MAP.  I suggested thats because the map stuff that we have doesnt yet have stage  data published.  Now maybe the RedHill Biopharma stage  trial should have had enough preliminary data that they could have gotten into DDW in May but I cant speak to that.

Honestly I was so glad they did  it made me personally feel much better about the idea of having one at that time I was about to have surgery and was going to potentially need a temporary ileostomy. it was very secure easy to hide and while Im sure leaking is possible it felt secure enough to an over paranoid newly married woman that I didnt even feel like I needed to check it very often. It was much better than I imagined it to be. Of course your surgery is much bigger and what youre going through is absolutely different which sucks but I hope you have some of your anxieties eased before surgery.I send you well wishes and hope that you only see improvement if you choose surgery. Its scary and stressful and its not fair that those are the options you have. Just know youre not alone and post whenever you need some support in this sub.

My husband was with me at the hospital when I was told by the doctor I had Crohns. He has been a great support.

9632747,0,t1_da0fmsb,gt Yeah thats what Im thinking. Just doing plain toast and maybe try the rest of the BRAT diet if you can tolerate it bananas rice applesauce. Its been discredited because its isnt the cure all they once thought but IIRC applesauce and bananas can add a little pectin which can firm things up a bit but theyre still pretty easy to digest and rice is gentle. Ive always found its a nice goto when Im trying to take it easy and get back to normal. gt I was thinking like Ensure or Boost I dont know if thats the same as your whey protein shakes... These complete nutritional shakes are great because you can get high protein or a plus version that has double the calories when youre really flaring. Its basically a protein shake but they add tons of vitamins and minerals. Not that you should do this but I think its designed to be a complete nutritional replacement option as in you could drink only them and not become malnourished dont quote me on this without consulting google lol. Boost has a simply Boost version that has like  ingredients plus the  vitamins amp minerals so it almost seems natural when I drink it haha.gt And I totally understand that lost feeling and Ive cried in more doctors offices than I can count because it really feels like they dont get it. It took my a long time to realize that doctors are not omniscient and that unless they have IBD theyll never TRULY understand their patients symptoms. So I just have to stand up for myself when I know my body isnt right and eventually a doctor will listen to me and figure it out. Sometimes it takes a second third or fourth opinion to find someone who really knows enough about IBD to be helpful. gt When I crashed during my first major flare I went from partying at college to vomiting uncontrollably and losing  pounds in two weeks. I couldnt even leave my apartment to get a cab without having to rest multiple times to avoid passing out. If found that with my disease it goes from  in no time. gt Even after that flare I still go from happygolucky totally painfree to the ER in about  hours if I eat the wrong thing. Im currently on the books to see a surgeon for this so dont think this is what you should expect when you get to remission! Ive was diagnosed at age  and now Im  so its kinda surprising I havent had surgery yet and I think Ive been living with bad symptoms for longer than I should have because its been so long that I dont know otherwise. gt If you ever want to PM about anything emotional support or whatever please feel free to!

Keep in mind that when your tissue is inflamed i.e. in a flare that also incredibly increases your risk of cancer. Since this is a lifelong disease I think the benefits of the medicine outweigh the risks.Also just a few more tips since for some reason doctors tend to not recommend this but get your son on some calcium and B supplements. Those are difficult to absorb when tissue is inflamed and are very important to a growing boy.,CrohnsDisease,dbsr4ic,3,t5_2s453

10947127,0,t1_de9146m,Some words of advice from someone who was also diagnosed at a young age  and has had the disease for about  years now you should keep an updated list of all medications youre on. There are even apps now that you can do this on. If youre stuck with this GI then as mentioned you should educate yourself as much as you can not only about the disease in general but also your particular case. Do you know the location of your disease and the extent of it? You should keep track of your CRP marker of inflammation from a blood test and fecal calprotectin marker of inflammation from a stool test. A good GI should be checking at least one of these regularly. The more you know about your disease the better you can advocate for yourself and receive better treatment. This should help you to avoid any longterm complicationsdamage and hopefully avoid any surgery. If youre unable to get in to see your GI sooner is there a primary care physician you can see? A family doctor? If pain is your issue they should at least be able to prescribe something in the meantime as you wait to see your GI.,CrohnsDisease,de94a8y,3,t5_2s453

11445712,0,t3_63d1pt,They dont boost your immune system they help it work properly. Your white blood cells use vitamin D to respond to infection. Thats really important when your immune system is suppressed. Vitamin C is water soluble so whatever you dont use you will pee out. I take  IU per day of vitamin D and because of that I dont get sick anymore than anyone else in my house. ,CrohnsDisease,dftd0or,2,t5_2s453

Did all  in my stomach under the direction of a nurse Abbvie has a service where a nurse will come to your house to help you with your loading dose.

11509673,0,t3_645y4m,My situation has been fairly similar I posted about it  awhile back. Since my post Ive switched insurance and had a consult with another GI clinic. She ordered a capsule endoscopy right away which I have scheduled for the th. If your GI wont listen to you find another one. I was really afraid but now I have a great team of doctors who are actually listening to me and investigating further into diagnosing me. They all suspect the Crohns is located in my small intestine as my colonoscopy was clear as well. ,CrohnsDisease,dg0mfqy,3,t5_2s453

11609999,0,t3_65mz4t,F currently living in a trailer with six other people not including myself and my boyfriend. Ive lived abroad in hostels my own apartment had roommates and all of the situations Ive lived in have been easier than this. Having UC asthma and eczema can be a nightmare if Im not seeing my doctor regularly. My environment is usually very stressful due to my bfs lazy sister who doesnt watch her three bratty children a passive brother who doesnt work or shower and mother who enables the chaos in said tiny trailer. The only times it can be tolerable is whenever I take a walk or they all leave. Ive considered living with my parents who are about fifteen minutes away from us. I am not allowed to have him live with me even in another room... My parents are born again Christians and are extremely weird about helping us move forward into our own place even with jobs! Its almost impossible to relay what exactly the disease is and why I havent worked a fulltime job in easily a year now partially due to two hospitalizations for pneumonia. Thankfully Ive made it to where I am finally going to try Remicade in a few days. Im hoping I can get back to being healthy and have us move out. Living with people who disregard their health and boundaries is not where me and my S.O. plan on being within the next three months. Im never going to let my disease take me out for this long again. ,CrohnsDisease,dgc0529,1,t5_2s453
11625189,0,t1_dgdpblx,Thank you! Yeah so far Im not super impressed with the results  I think Id rather sleep than eat at this point. The real sad part is that I think I prefer diarrhea over constipation!,CrohnsDisease,dgdq6jh,2,t5_2s453
11636197,0,t1_dgdo9xa,Appreciate that very much. I decided to try taking my dosage before bed and that seems to be working well. The stale taste I was experiencing has been almost nonexistent during the day and I havent been feeling nauseous or exhausted.Heres hoping this trend continues!,CrohnsDisease,dgez4zb,1,t5_2s453

11654301,0,t3_667oh1,No helpful recommendations but just as an FYI theres some pretty compelling evidence that Pentasa doesnt do very much for CD. I definitely wouldnt go into debt for it.Corticosteroids are the devil but would it be an option for the short term? Do a systemic anti fungal for the histo at the same time?,CrohnsDisease,dgh12n5,1,t5_2s453
11662157,0,t3_66b6zb,I tried Cimzia no dice for me. It seems so hit or miss what does  doesnt work for different people though so hopefully it does for you!I dont think the shots were too bad I remember the Humira shots being the worst so if you can handle those you should be fine.,CrohnsDisease,dghx57o,2,t5_2s453

11710181,0,t3_672dk5,Is the water in the bowl very red as well? Or do you only see blood when you wipe?Its been awhile since Ive seen that kind of blood but not uncommon for me. I would be more freaked out of the whole bowl was red. I always recommend going to that doctor it never hurts and if for nothing else go just to help with the anxiety. ,CrohnsDisease,dgndn5g,4,t5_2s453
11755906,0,t1_dgsjxlf,So I havent had an endoscopy yet actually. Just  an MRI and colonoscopy. I actually found this GI bc my PCP basically said he cant help me anymore. I am in the process of findIng a new PCP.  The specialist Im seeing right now is a Nurse Practitioner at the Gastroenterology center. ,CrohnsDisease,dgsk85j,1,t5_2s453
11768848,0,t3_67x4un,You do want a diagnosis even if you end up on the same meds ones working today may not tomorrow or some may have side effects for one of your other diseases. If you have images from the colonoscopy maybe you can send to the gastro doc before going there to get another opinion. Its pretty frustrating when docs dont know and you can get advice from a GP whether or not you have crohns but if you can get the best advice possible and see a gastro doc.  All that said its really easy to identify with symptoms and think you have a disease and thats just an issue with pharma advertisementsthe internetsself diagnosing. ,CrohnsDisease,dgu12zf,3,t5_2s453
11774757,0,t3_67wuwy,I used medicaid when I lost my parents insurance and couldnt afford private insurance from the state healthcare marketplace. It paid for basically everything.. and youd probably qualify for your states version of it.,CrohnsDisease,dgupcci,1,t5_2s453

11799841,0,t3_67rdeq,Thank you everyone. Sorry I kind of ghosted the Crohns subreddit. I just needed a rant. The bf and I Skyped that night and it helpedalong with a wine cooler. I was in a bad place mentally. Still not feeling  yet but I know Ill get back there again. Gotta make sure I keep taking the damn Zoloft every night. Some nights I forget in spite of having a morningevening week pillbox. Ive been playing a game on my phone Im addicted to to help pass the time. Also Netflix. And family forcing me to go places. Though tomorrow I look forward to seeing my favorite artist in concertAndrew McMahon and all his monikers. lt I appreciate everyone reaching out.

11809576,0,t3_68hjva,I had one a year ago and it is super easy. Honestly trying to figure out how to douche myself was more stressful than the actual procedure. Words of advice use a mirror because I literally thought I had no butthole for a solid  minutes! Then when you go home youll be extremely high and you get to eat a cheeseburger. Why? Because you had a camera up your butt and you deserved it. Also make your familyfriendswhoever is helping you sign a contract that they will not record you or video you as you are high. I hate my friends  ,CrohnsDisease,dgynn5c,3,t5_2s453
