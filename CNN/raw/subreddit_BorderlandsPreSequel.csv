The new vault hunters are more interesting and fun than the new hunters in BL loot rarity and availability of uniques is a ton less frustrating than BL player character dialogue makes missions more immersive. TVHM enemies come with more difficulties than just we made a bunch of them armored so you better use corrosive or they have a lot of HP now better use slag.I could go on about the gameplay things I like but to be fair there are a couple of things I dont like which I also wont mention here.On PC the game is far better optimized. Menus almost never bug out a recurring problem since BL and almost every map runs at fps on my computer granted I dont have the most powerful PC but its powerful enough to run comparablemore graphicsheavy games at fps on higher settings.

2350859,0,t3_2m9y0t,Big question is what kinda equipment are you using? That asideVanguard Phalanx isnt that useful. If you do take it Id recommend just one point the HP regen in my experience isnt enough to warrant the points spent. If you have a Vibra Pulse or the Probe then you wont need the points in Vanguard at all.If you took those  points out of Vanguard you could fill both United Front Phalanx and Prepare for Glory! Phalanx to Overload Ceraunic Storm is great but sadly not as great as Elemental Barrage Ceraunic Storm. If you reach  stacks of Maelstrom you have a  chance to not consume ammo while Storm Weaving is up. That ultimately leads to insane DPS.Hades Shackles Ceraunic Storm really isnt that great but if you have a Quasar and a cryo slam then its actually pretty nice. If you run a Quasar over a Storm Front Id recommend picking it up leaving one point for Overload.Thats how I run my Maelstrom buildShock Ol Rosie Hellfire Excalibastard Moxxis ProbeShield Black HoleGrenade Storm Front  QuasarClass Mod Surging StormOz Kit Arctic Oxidizer,BorderlandsPreSequel,cm29z16,4,t5_31a7n

A generic Tediore IVF and an Torgue shotgun should be all you need as far as weapons are concerned.Tediore reloads will absolutely DESTROY him. Have a weapon with a superquick reload speed that you can use to build your stacks then switch to the Tediore and hit him with reloaded grenades as quickly as you can. The damage you cause is STAGGERING.When you deplete his shield and he goes to the center of the arena jump over his shockwave and wait for his shield to recharge reloading that quick weapon if you can! before throwing more IVF reloads at him.This of course expends ammo like crazy so youll want to try and restock as much as possible between phases. If you have the DD.E Oz Kit youll get drops fairly regularly.His second set of forms are a little tougher if only because its hard to hit him in the face while hes knocking you around. I put one point into Defensive Subroutines and try to get as much of the damage done during the Shield buff because the rate at which you regen shields mostly compensates for all the elemental damage youll be taking.If you go into Second Wind you should be specd into the skills that give you the Explosive Novas and if theyre too far away youll have to search for enemies to kill.

3037628,0,t1_cocl5ue,But thats old PC games being compared to currentnewer console games. Not current PC games compared to their console counterparts. My PC cannot run most games that come out these days but they sure as hell can run old games which explains the inflated number used in that article. Not every PC user has a good PC they can use to play all these modern games. Also PCs are more accessible in many other countries than some consoles are. Some countries outright ban consoles but they have no restrictions on PCs. If a game on a console doesnt come in your native language and you dont know one of the languages that it does have ... the PC release of the same game usually has someone do a translation for it either official or unofficial. When I play a game on my PC it is either an indie title or an older title. My computer is old and I cannot afford to purchase a new one or get new parts for it as I am currently unemployed and Im going to school. Actually I got this PC for free second hand from my workplace and this thing is an old workstation that I semiFrankensteined. I was going to save up for a good PC but those plans had to be trashed when I was forced out of employment there and I ended up going back to school. So I am stuck with an older PC that cant run modern games and I am forced to play them on my . I used to be huge on PC gaming when I had my beast of a laptop but it died a few years ago. I was on CounterStrike league teams I was in several guilds in WoW and was always playing on my PC over my PS didnt get my  until after my laptop broke and where I was living at the time I had no room for a PC as I didnt want another laptop due to the limited internal customizationreplacementDont get me wrong though I still think games should be developed with PC in mind first especially Bethesda releases those are ALWAYS better on PC though I do own a copy Morrowind Oblivion Skyrim and Fallout  on both PC and XBox then ported to the consoles. But I dont think they should just leave out consoles entirely. Theyre easy and convenient to set up nor do they require anywhere near the amount of maintenance that you should do on your PC ie antivirusmalwarespyware defrags making sure all your drivers are up to date among other things that should be done on a regular basis on PC theyre basically plug and play with the exceptions of updates and newer games that require installs. Consoles are just convenient alternatives to PC but they shouldnt be complete replacements.I would also like to say that I believe the distance between PC users and PS and X users is because many people havent even upgraded to next gen either. Either due to the fact that both Sony and Microsoft had very rocky lastgen releases or decided to skip this gen and just get PCs.,BorderlandsPreSequel,cocul22,1,t5_31a7n

Instead they go behind his back and betray him which would piss anybody off. And as a result they made the situation worse. They took away his ability to trust and completely screwed him over  twice. Jack may have no redeeming characteristics in BL but he almost did in TPS.     I honestly think that Moxxi is the biggest player in TPS. She has links to damn near everyone and is constantly fiddling with situations. I can even claim that Roland and Lilith only got involved because of Moxxi to betray Jack  BEFORE he air locked the scientists. They had a plan and they didnt deviate even when he did the unthinkable... Because they were allied with Moxxi. And she does it because she has a vague sense of distrust. About a man she once dated.  think about how many dudes Moxxi has hooked up with in the BL verse. She maaaay not be the best judge of character. I could even argue that Moxxi only gets involved to protect her assets the bar on the moon. Think about it. Jack retakes Helios secures the thing destroying the moon and then once the moon is safe she pops him and the weapon into a black hole. Protect my investments and get rid of a problem. The only reason it didnt work is Jacks sense of self preservation.    This is why I shouldnt drink and reddit. ,BorderlandsPreSequel,cqh9jjv,1,t5_31a7n
3745634,0,t3_30n0m3,Ive been looking for changes between Xbone online but still havent found a sure response anywhere.  But...I found somewhat of an answer on this PS forum where people were complaining about how duping ruins the game.  Ha whatever if thats how they feel but it looks like its still around in the Handsome Collection.I logged in a ton of time on the  and always duped with my brother who was playing same roomdifferent TV with this methodMake sure youre not near any save points first the Grinder room by Springs works for me  If you are in possession of the items that youre trying to duplicate make sure you are the guest in the other players game.  Then just open your inventory drop that shit and dashboard home out of the game completely.  My guess here is that on Xbone well have to make sure that the game closes after you dashboardJoin back into the game it helps if the other player just sends you a game invite so you can go right back in and you should still have the items you dropped and there will be a puddle of oranges back where you dropped them originally as well.Im bout to log on to Xbone and try myself Ill let you know if I see any changes.GT is Birdoman if you want I have a ton of gunsshields I can dupe for you that some badass rando dropped in my game one day.

3751331,0,t3_33a8qm,Aside from the big names theyve lost especially Burch thats the thing that makes me worry about the future of the series.The Presequel featured really cool environments and some amazingly cool gameplay hooks I had lots of fun with the open lunar environments and the different dynamics that caused in gameplay and Im going to be sorry if we go back completely to BLBL standardplanetaryshooter territory. TPS did so much cool stuff.The problem with TPS is that it also miserably failed on execution in a few ways. Lategame farming was so boring that I pretty much leveled to  and dropped the game for months until Claptastic Voyage came out you had great environments to play in but they were noticeably devoid of either interesting things to shoot or interesting things to farm. Much of the game was either too easy or too hard I had to spend a significant amount of time grinding before RKMV on both normal and TVHM just because the games XP progression had left me badly underleveled for those fights. And lets not get started on the utter bullshit that was the Eclipse fight everything about that fight had me excited until my partner and I realized that he attacked so aggressively that the only way we were going to win was by hiding behind terrain and shooting him in the knees for the better part of an hour.TPS is everything Borderlands could aspire to be. New fresh interesting. And its everything Im worried Borderlands could become.,BorderlandsPreSequel,cqjvlzb,1,t5_31a7n

6110608,0,t3_3z7gic,Yes! Athena is badass! Maelstrom is mad powerful but dont forget by endgame presequel you can have all  capstones so fuggit start your build however you fancy.Also stacking with Athena is very different to stacking with gaige. Maelstrom stacks collect and dissipate very quickly and have a kind of ebb and flow with gameplay unlike with gaige where you build your stacks slowly and losing them is a big deal,BorderlandsPreSequel,cyk7pdk,1,t5_31a7n

Do Nakayamas quests until you get Kill Meg then you can farm Meg to your hearts content. Meg also gives solid XP so youll level up a bit too.As for target legendaries start grinding the Torrent SMGs that meg drops  at a time with the highest level purple lasers you can find to try and get the MinMin Lighter. Its a niche legendary Tediore laser that shoots big slow balls of lightning. It does insane damage though and most of the final boss is shield so youll want that to help you out. You can shoot the lightning balls to make them explode too.,BorderlandsPreSequel,dei85jq,4,t5_31a7n
