787925,0,t3_236315,yes. I like him. I dont understand why so many people dislike him  hes a nice guy a lot of the time but a lot of people are mean at times. Just because Pluper can be a normal person at times doesnt affect my opinion of him. I believe that everyone should be given a second chance. Now there is the question of reliability. Last time we added him he left after making some drama. I dont want drama to be a part of this group  so if he does get readded he will be instantaneously kicked if he starts any drama whatsoever. Not only that if he leaves again I will not say yes next time.,NoodleUHC,cgtuacq,1,t5_313vb
