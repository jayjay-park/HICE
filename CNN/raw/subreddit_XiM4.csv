11433295,0,t3_630vga,Dont have HZD but with TLOU its pretty hard to sneak with a kb. Maybe others have found a workaround with just a mkb but I didnt. Good news is that XIM supports use of the old PSmove navigation controller That you can use as a substitute for kbbased movement. OR you can use the Dualshock for movement and mouse for aiming. If you dont know you need to have dualshock plugged into the XIM at all times to authenticate controller attachment to your PS.,XiM4,dfryamf,2,t5_37zw7
