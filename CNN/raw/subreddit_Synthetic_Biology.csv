If you could get involved as a mentor its really a great competition and helps expose you to some of the crazy ideas syn bio can achieve. NonCanadian  schools would include MIT Harvard BU and UCB.,Synthetic_Biology,chpu4qt,3,t5_2y4be

11746110,0,t3_67gqrf,Where I go to school our iGEM team is run primarily by undergrads with a few grad students as mentors. The grad students help guide the research but the primary execution of the project and learning is done by the undergrads. I did it the summer after my freshman year and it was an incredible learning experience. If you could do it in addition to your masters thesis I would definitely recommend that you do! The iGEM culture encourages wild outofthebox thinking and creativity which may not be characteristics of working on a multiyear thesis project and a refreshing break from the monotony of lab work. However if you had to pick one I think it would be more worthwhile for your career to work on a masters thesis since to me it seems that iGEM is often seen as a forfun undergrad activity rather than a serious graduatelevel endeavor.  ,Synthetic_Biology,dgrg94u,1,t5_2y4be
