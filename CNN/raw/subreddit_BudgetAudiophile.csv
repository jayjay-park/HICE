1188250,0,t1_ci39zpb,I believe that an amp produces more bass because it can drive a load with a relatively flat frequency response. In contrast a line level device  or a lowpower amp a phone etc. might be able to produce a flat frequency response with a high ohm load like an amplifier or recording device but struggle when connected to something with less resistance.For example the OPs headphones have an impendance of  ohms. Thats too much for the device to handle and as bass is harder to drive requires more power the bass will be quieter. With an amp enough power is given for the whole system to have a flat response.In theory you should keep the volume on the phone as high as possible and adjust the volume on the amp for maximum dynamic range. However a phone will often distort at high volumes so you might need to bring it down a bit.,BudgetAudiophile,ci3ap8j,1,t5_300we

3557453,0,t1_cpvydko,An SA should work fine as Im doubtful that youll be using much more than  watts.  Would the sound produced from an AVR sound as good as the stereo amp...yes and better IMO because you can cross them over at a certain frequency.  If the speakers only go to say Hz then you can cross the main channels at that level so the speaker is not struggling to produce those lower tones.  This will help clean up the sound.  Same thing goes for adding a sub into the mix.  You cross the mains at a frequency and then you can cross the sub at or near that frequency so you dont get any overlap.  With a stereo receiver you mains will get full signal and you xover the sub on its amp but youre going to get overlap which can make it sound bloated.  Im a big fan of AVRs as they give you a lot of control that mini amps and stereo receivers dont.  Thats just me.,BudgetAudiophile,cpxrva5,1,t5_300we

6150238,0,t3_3zovma,These are all products I have recommended.  Sadly the Q Acoustics are hard to get in the states but are outstanding little speakers.  The Denon AVRw is going to be a very solid receiver.  But unless you are running Atmos I think your money is better spent on a higher model from a previous year.  I am not sure if they are comparable in price but the Denon x would be a better option simply because it has MUCH better room correction.  But the xw is still a nice receiver and will work very well for you if something like the x isnt available.  I use the x as my benchmark receiver as it is the cheapest way to get Audyssey MultEQ XT and Sub EQ.  That said since the xw has Audyssey MultEQ XT it is the next step down from the MultEQ xt so there wouldnt be a need to get something like the xw because it provides the same room correction.  So xw or xw.  X is better for several reasons but the xw is very capable too if you arent able to find an x.I would make sub recommendations but they would all be stuff available in the US.  Like the BIC F is my favorite budget sub but I dont know if it is available where you are.Good luck! ,BudgetAudiophile,cyopulg,3,t5_300we

Do not go on Craigslist and buy big impressivelooking speakers from the s.  Those are crap.The Overnight Sensations are not crap.  Theyre excellent.  If youve never built speakers well here is your first project.  Suck it up and decide that you will see it through.  Thats the hardest part trying something new can be scary.  But Parts Express has videos and an active forum  you will find answers to every question and experienced builders will help.DIY is the only way you can get high quality at a low price.  You wont regret it.  Further if you build one pair odds are good you will build more.  The awesome part is that you can get into world class speakers fairly easily.  The best DIY designs are  or so.  I know thats a lot of money.  But they will outperform five and six figure speakers.  Comparing this to cars it would be like spending  on car parts and building something that would outperform a  used Ferrari.

8175545,0,t3_4r9rzn,Im not sure but it sounds like the problem may be that the RX is sending signals below hz to the subwoofer and its still sending a fullrange signal to the main speakers  i.e. its not a true crossover its just putting a lowpass filter on the sub out.I even checked the RX manual and Im still not sure. It says the cutoff for the sub out is hz and never uses the word crossover to describe what its doing.You may be able to fix this by going into the receivers setup and telling the RX that the Peaveys are SMALL speakers instead of LARGE that typically limits the amount of bass that is sent to them.If that doesnt work you could maybe try some other way of highpassing your Peaveys so that they dont try to play anything below hz like maybe a hz version of something like this if one exists though that might be more trouble than its worth. To be honest I wouldnt bother  older preHDMI receivers like your Yamaha can be had for reallllllllly cheap on the used market like ish.

8253109,0,t1_d58sulb,Thanks for the detailed answer and suggestions. The Scarlett i does seem more attractive to me in that it would eliminate the DI boxes. Im not thrilled about the knobs and XLR outs being on the same side of the i  trying to think of a way to place it where Id have convenient access to the volume knob without having a mess of xlr cables dumping out onto my desktop. Im guessing that Id position it underneath and to the rear of the monitors with the knobs and wires facing to my left would be a workable configuration.The volume knob is not really a big win for me  Im currently living with a volume knob situation on the S and not feeling a huge benefit from that. My keyboard has volume and mute controls and they work even when my desktop is locked which is nice because I or someone else might want to adjust the volume without the need to unlock the computer.Also your suggestion about running both channels directly to the sub first does make total sense I think I just avoided it because I have the speakers at opposite ends of the room and the sub next to one of the sets of speakers with the computer in the middle of the room. Id just need to buy more XLR cables to get that set up so no big deal.I didnt bother running XLR to the sub because I didnt foresee it being as susceptible to audible interference at the frequencies it puts out. In the past using RCA cables out to LampR speakers Ive definitely noticed a buzzing sound from interference but it was at a frequency the sub wouldnt transmit. Im only speculating about this but cant say that Ive ever heard buzzing come out of the sub. Were I to get an internal soundcard and this would still be my preference over an external DAC Id probably stick with just running the  phono line to it as I am now and that would give me control of the sub channel at the software level which might be nice and would allow me to eliminate the MX.,BudgetAudiophile,d5970fi,1,t5_300we

Thrift stores can be good but you have to get away from goodwill as most of their good stuff gets sold online.

Now everything runs off HDMI so the old gear is obsolete meaning you can get a receiver that cost thousands back in the day for a little bit of nothing. For explaining optical inputs... there is a conversion that happens between the source Bluray DVD MP anything on a computer or cell phone and the speakers. Typically on the device itself the conversion isnt done very well. Where the conversion happens is called the Digital to Analog Converter DAC. If you use RCA or . mm headphone cables to get audio from one device to another the conversion has already happened. Typically the conversion from a TV or a phone isnt very good. However using an optical cable to a receiver allows the receiver to do the conversion which is normally much better. Look into SVS and Def Tech for subwoofers. ,BudgetAudiophile,d93ymx2,2,t5_300we

Your TV idea is a good one and I have a Fire Stick but I really wanted something standalone that wouldnt need the TV on.So Ive splashed out on a new microsystem for  from Peter Tyson. This is the package Denon DM with Q Acoustics  Speakers. Speaker cable also thrown in.Both units are really well reviewed here in the UK and having done price comparisions with other sites this feels like a good deal.  optical ins Ill use one for the TV and the other for Airport Express a DAB radio radio is a big priority of mine small form factor good for my flat  plus well reviewed bookcase speakers. I did consider the Monitor Bronze s but they would have been too big. Due to be delivered tomorrow but sods law I now have an immovable meeting at work which means I may not be able to get it tomorrow. But glad its coming.Bidding on Airport Expresses and have ordered the cablesbanana plugs I need from Amazon.

10404595,0,t3_5oy2j3,Alright the problem here is your TV has no variable or line level RCA outputs. Im going to offer a couple of options.  An optical DAC with a remote line level controller and powered monitors. DAC Remote volume control Really good sounding powered monitors Wait til they go down to about  for the pair or buy them on massdrop now you have  hours to decide. Totals to . Same setup as above but will switch out the JBLs for something cheaper and totals to about . Wait til the Micca PBX are in stock at amazon. They run . If you can swing for the JBLs do it though.. The best option in my opinion would be to get a cheap . receiver with an optical input. You can pair this with any pair of passive speaker you want you can purchase a used receiver from craigs or ebay you can add a center channel at a later date and more importantly you can add a subwoofer when your budget allows and have proper bass management with high and low pass filters and eq.,BudgetAudiophile,dcnff1g,5,t5_300we

11386440,0,t3_62fgs0,Awesome job really tons of measurements. Im pretty impressed....and that transformer! The reasons I would guess they dont seem to be crazy popular on reddit anyway is threefold.. No passive stuff to pair with the cheap and convenient T amps everyone and their mothers are getting.. A lot of their designs dont fit into the unreasonably super clean angled look that goes well with Ikea desks and a keyless mechanical keyboard. People need everything to look great and symmetrical when they take pics with their DSLR to post on the internet. The M is probably their one design that works in this scenario. . As an extension and combination of the previous two points they can easily be conflated with the computer speaker tier sound. This is a risk they take when offering their lowerend stuff that may very well have those qualities. Additionally placing tone controls and not offering passive speakers can also make a lot of audiophiles automatically write them off.Do you ever plan on doing the LSR or do you figure you and strategic can cover more ground if you review different products? Or would it be a waste since the LSR is a known quantity? Anyway looking forward to the next Polk review! Hoping the S is a solid speaker. Currently that price point is occupied by the RBH RBi if someone doesnt need bass and the Elac B if someone is treblesensitive. ,BudgetAudiophile,dfmmtlx,3,t5_300we

11508903,0,t3_649yy8,Also consider the Wavecrest HVL If the graphs they publish are to be believed should be a fantastic pair of speakers. I actually would think about passing on the Level Twos because outside of the impressive build quality Average Joe wasnt too impressed with them not when the Pioneer BS is as cheap as it is.StrategicDeceiver called the Fluance SX unlistenable and embarrassing but the signature series is quite different. Fluance originally had some really bad qualitycontrol problems with the crossovers and it showed up on the Audioholics review of the tower versions. After it was all sorted the review was very positive. Here is the measurement of the towers. Seems they are voiced warm like the popular pioneers but with smoother response.I havent heard any of the three speakers mentioned so this is going purely off of measurements. Pass on the HTDs go for the Fluance if you want warmly voiced speakers go for the Wavecrest if you want closer to neutral if you believe their measurements. ,BudgetAudiophile,dg0janw,2,t5_300we

11696148,0,t3_66u7kc,I think it comes down to what type of sound you like. The Wharfdales and Elacs will sound more laid back and softer in the top end and the KEFs will be more to forward in the middle and high frequencies. Ive only owned KEFS out of these  and it was a much more high end pair but I still think KEFs have some of the best sound available in a speaker. I think based on reading a ton on the others though that they may be perceived as more musical and less sterile. Flat sounding speakers are definitely an aquired taste and typically very different than most people have heard.,BudgetAudiophile,dglrz2v,1,t5_300we
