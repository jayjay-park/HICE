9250291,0,t3_56qd1s,Victoria probably just got a yeast infection again because she keeps wearing those disgusting tight yoga pants that she probably never washes and Alan needed to run to the store to buy her vagisil. Its happened before.,SeriousGaming,d8ojigq,3,t5_2ssrt
9335201,0,t1_d8z73nq,its also that the stream is toxic for new viewers They dont understand why alan looks so depressed why vic looks so bored and tons of other toxic stuff they do like biting their nails. Any new viewer would be scared away in  minutes the ones who make it past that and maybe see some fun in their stream would be banned anyways since mods ban anyone who isnt a regular for almost anything. ,SeriousGaming,d8zazmx,3,t5_2ssrt
9379879,0,t3_591kmw,I can imagine Vic get a heartattack from seeing that post of your xDSeen people comment on that before guess if thats the case nobody will care as long as he donates money and money is all that counts on that stream. Would the day come that he lost all his money I bet he would be banned in seconds if hes quilty. Kinda ridiculous to see how hes being milked on the stream. ,SeriousGaming,d94ysws,6,t5_2ssrt
9724042,0,t1_dabp4jg,They dont. Several previous large donors and contributors are gone but they never mention them or ask how theyre doing. The only person I saw them concerned about was Acid because they used to do k donations for stupid shit like shave your head. They put on this fake smile victim complex and attitude of caring but more people are seeing through their bullshit.,SeriousGaming,dabp8sl,11,t5_2ssrt

9792655,0,t3_5fgt3d,what in the actual fuck is wrong with you people. I have gone through this reddit since it was linked to me by a viewer and I am literally disgusted by all of you. These people who shit post but are still subbed? then this whatever attention whore you want to call him. Like I get the occassional shit in chat when i go back because I go in and I drunk shit post and I make my jokes but you guys are literally a new all time low. So either you people have no self worth no lives or you are so bitter because your parents didnt love you but taking it out on  people who want to keep up the career theyve been at for so long and DESERVE every moment of success they have is just absolutely insane. This is insane. You people are fucking insane. ,SeriousGaming,dak5o1r,-2,t5_2ssrt

9796660,0,t1_dak7seu,True streaming can be a pretty lucrative and competitive business however I do see many other streamers actively supporting other streamers online during their streams and when they end their stream most will even look and choose for their chatsubs to do raids on other streamers big and sometimes just small streamers to give them that boost they may need if they are new passing along the good vibes to others. I have been watching Alan and Vic for a long time however during all of the hours of my watching I have yet to once see them do a raid on any other streamers when they shut down their stream at night. obviously not during marathons Not saying they havent in the past I am only going my own personal experience. Also Ive never understood why they dont raid Vics brothers stream. I do understand what you have said about them knowing lots of people at PAX etc...but they keep an eye on those big streamers out there anyway so therefore they would know of them. The only time I hear mention of other streamers on their chat is if Alan is wining about them because of the big donations and viewer counts others get. Maybe if they would raid one of the streamers that they seem to be so jealous of then the other streamer will reciprocate. One hand washes the other right? but they seem to be just one sided. Just my opinion we are all here to be able to express our opinions and frustrations here instead of in their live chat where we get shut down for expressing ourselves. Do I enjoy their stream? absolutely. Do they dedicate lots of hours to it? absolutely however sometimes those of us looking from the outside in see other says that they can improve while they have the chance.,SeriousGaming,daknem6,5,t5_2ssrt

10150652,1,t3_5lcav1,Dude seriously? WTF lol. If you get triggered by the way someone eats you have some serious issues. She isnt the only woman in the world that takes big bites when they eat ITS HOW PEOPLE FUCKING EAT. People eat food they enjoy fast some dont. Its just how the world works. A person can eat however the fuck they like. Its funny how you tell us not to judge you yet you are judging her for her eating habits. Like the other person said. Show us how you eat please for comparison would appreciate it.,SeriousGaming,dbumrey,5,t5_2ssrt
