9741188,0,t1_dadt32b,Reading thedonald is what enlightened me to this. They shit post and meme like crazy sure. Yet are the most kind and welcoming to anybody. I cant count how many times I saw personal stories from people whether they be black gay muslim former Bernie supporters you name it who came over to the Trump side due to the kindness shown by people at TheDonald. I dont judge the world based off near anonymous comments. I think Reddit is a cesspool other than TheDonald. I cant wait to see it go up in flames. ,SpezForPrison,dadtbal,1,t5_3glzb
