11526440,0,t3_64caqt,I suppose your question is to seek some sort of knowledge? Im new to producing as well so please give us your questions! Itll help me learn as well. Im not from the U.K. physically but thanks to Reddit were all in the same digital community! Thats close enough I suppose DWhats on your mind youd like to learn more about? Im also trying my best to learn more and have learned a decent amount so far through my own research and discussions. So please ask your questions because Im certain itll help all of us newbies and Ill pass along information that Ive learned so far.Heres a track I made last night kind of generalized techno I suppose. I dont know how to DJ but I do know a DJ JANKO check out his SoundCloud. Ive been learning through the extended network  not so much about DJing but producing because Id like to make the beats for DJs to spin.,Bedroom_Producers,dg2iv61,2,t5_31yby
