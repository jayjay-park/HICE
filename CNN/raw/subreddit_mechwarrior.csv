541425,0,t1_cg1skqj,This is pretty straightforward for SOME versions. You need to pay attention to which edition of MW you have. The first one I had was this edition Which would only play through a tedious tutorial setup which ends with you always running the game through dosbox.Titanium edition however is as simply as putting the disk in and running MechVM,mechwarrior,cg1tejk,2,t5_2sr71

10106548,0,t3_5cfad2,A question for MCWould the executable MCRel.exe from the official MS source code work as a fixed executable for the version that comes with the bik videos?
