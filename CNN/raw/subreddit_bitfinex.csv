As in what specific thing have you observed thats different from what you expected?Bear in mind that the fee is only paid to you as an accumulated lump sum once every  hours so funding can openclose repeatedly all day without seeming to have paid you anything.,bitfinex,cwwdudc,1,t5_2xbox

11638703,0,t3_63fvgf,This is why you cant trade on margin especially on a site with a bad reputation like bitfinex. They may claim they dont do any of this stuff but the charts dont lie. They defenitly have bots front running orders. Ive notcied mini flash crashes that happen right before  a big move to the upside. These crashes only happen on bitfinex. So they know a nice move to the upside is coming so they steal a bunch of of stops real quick to the downside and profit.The best though was on  when they needed some extra cash and they flash crashed BTC from  down to !!!! How much did they make off of that by forcing literally every margin position to be liquidated?So first off dont trade cryptos on margin. nd dont ever put any money on bitfinex ever.,bitfinex,dgf9dj8,1,t5_2xbox
