Here  Imgur His train was either destroyed or captured and he was captured by the Russians. He was then taken to a Gulagprisoner of war camp Northwest of Moscow. He died after the war on October  ! He was  years old.Who knows how long he had been in the Gulag before dying. A lot of these Gulags were horrible living conditions very low rationed food if any and mostly all were labor camps. The weather especially in late October must have been brutally cold and they probably were not sufficiently dressed or sheltered.  Many of these POWs were held until  some even later. ,ww2DeathCards,czhuzn3,1,t5_3c68u
