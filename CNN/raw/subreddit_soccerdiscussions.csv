4720578,0,t1_ctpk7r7,Considering I watchattend NASL games second tier American soccer I couldnt care less about quality haha. Im definitely looking forward to watching as much of it as I can. Last year was really the first year Ive followed the sport closely and I love it. I played growing up but it wasnt easy to watch here in America except for the past few years and its really started to explode.  Id be interesting reading what you have to say about games in the Championship as Ive yet to find a team to support. I have a pretty close connection with Shrewsbury although in League  thanks to FM . ,soccerdiscussions,ctpkgkc,2,t5_39e79

4723999,0,t1_ctpwej9,I have all the faith in the world in Theo and think he can have a great season but with his recent injury problems it would be a risk to completely depend on him. ,soccerdiscussions,ctq006k,1,t5_39e79

4726652,0,t1_ctpz2zy,Aside from Mbemba coming in the biggest difference will be in how McClaren sets us up next season. Pardew exposed the defence by basing our game plan on nicking a goal and backs to wall defending as well as regularly playing a high line which never worked with WilliamsonTaylor and Coloccini playing centre back. With Carver we seemed to play a more open game but with less discipline in centre mid with Colback prone to following the ball too much and his partner cycling between several crap players played out of position. So teams were able to just cut through us over and over again with little resistance. We also had Cisse who cant hold the ball up particularly well which should be one of Mitrovics strengths. If he stops playing Colback and Anita together gets us controlling the ball a bit more then even without new additions well be able to keep the number of points lost due to mistakes to a minimum.If were able to take the pressure off the defence then well easily get enough points to stay up if not itll be a bit tighter but still reasonably comfortable. Get a couple of new defenders in and itll be able to win us points instead of costing us though.  ,soccerdiscussions,ctqc24f,1,t5_39e79

4732427,0,t1_ctr29mh,This is definitely true though Mexican teams cannot get into the Club World Cup through the Libertadores which they like going to unlike European teams. I think it would be pretty cool to see MLS teams in the Libertadores with Mexican teams. It would be sweet to see DC United play River Plate Boca Sao Paulo etc. in DC for a competitive match.,soccerdiscussions,ctr2buk,4,t5_39e79
4733240,0,t3_3fr044,I only really have looked into their attacking department. They brought back Iago Aspas following a pretty successful loan to Sevilla after failing completely at Liverpool. Aspas is a proven striker in La Liga and a fan favourite. Providing that Nolito can stay in form they are looking at a successful campaign. They also brought in John Guidetti on a free transfer from Man City. I see him as a low riskhigh reward bargain apperently he is amongst the best paid in the squad but cost them nothing to sign and is a proven goal scorer in Scotland and the Eredvisie.I think Celta is looking at an upper mid table finish.,soccerdiscussions,ctr60yj,4,t5_39e79
4734734,0,t1_ctqg2ht,I think its part of play. Knowing when to commit a tactical foul and when not to is a mark of a smart defender and Id hate to see it taken out of the game.My definition of a tactical foul though stipulates that the foul not be likely to cause injury. A tug of the shirt is a smart play a sliding tackle from behind is just reckless and dangerous.,soccerdiscussions,ctrctj5,1,t5_39e79

4768789,0,t1_ctvn7ju,Germanys golden generation as you called which I dont see it has nothing to do with foreign player limits.  Germany made a conscious effort to develop their youth leagues with a plan and a vision and it worked.  It all start in the youth levels and coaching and development.  Those are simple minded excuses that people like to come up with cause they dont want to admit their youth levels suck.  You can get rid of all foreign players in every euroean league and do you think that will make Wilshire into Ozil or Sterling into Arguero?  ,soccerdiscussions,ctvndyx,3,t5_39e79

5235703,0,t1_cv3eq95,Really good analysis! I guess Wenger said something similar that football is organized way too much and there is more stress on doing things right. Creativity and improvisation is not something that can be taught easily. However when you are a  yr old playing along side  yrs old then you have to think out of the box. ,soccerdiscussions,cvh3c8c,1,t5_39e79
