5937732,0,t3_3wljwl,Not really.  If anything you can see how this isnt the case.  Gokaiger had very little footage of the Zyuranger suits and didnt even make the obvious joke involving Kibaranger who also didnt have much screentime and the Kyoryuger dino team up movie didnt even have any scenes with Dragonranger which would have been pretty much a requirement for any adaptation.The closest you get are the nods to certain seasons like Dekaranger using the SPD battalizer or Gobusters using terms like its morphin time.  But even then it seems more like they used the props because they had them on hand and it was convenient Dekared needed a power up in that instance to set him apart from regular squad members and the phrases are just borrowed because the Japanese love taglines and gratuitous English so its only surprising they didnt use ones they own thanks to an American adaptation sooner.Other things like yellow being used for female rangers more or postZyuranger mecha being more common in anniversaries just come down to evolving trends.  Yellow has become associated as being more of a girls colour and most of the earlier mecha were very boxy and uninteresting designwise compared to the very elaborate and gimmick heavy designs of today.And of course theres things like ToQGer that just scream unadaptable.  From their plain and generic costumes to their combined mecha almost requiring a censor bar.  The changes would be far more apparent if there was any thought into how footageseasons will need to work in the US let alone if Saban had any say in how things were done.,supersentai,cxxytox,5,t5_2skzg

It hits the feels so much more when you have emotional investment in the characters.  For instance when we first meet a grown up Kai from Magiranger I didnt react the first time around other than oh theres another ranger.  This time I got excited to see my old friend whom Ive been through many adventures with.  I hope that makes sense.  ,supersentai,d1ji3m6,1,t5_2skzg

Some hate it some like it.  Episode  gives you an idea of the tone for the season so youll know.Personally I watched the first few episodes one night and kept wanting to watch more and finished it up in a few days sometimes seasons will take me a week or two based on how many episodes I can sit through and keep my interest.I think its one of those underrated seasons.  Its by no means the best but it deserves a spot towards being entertaining.,supersentai,d1ljkr2,1,t5_2skzg

9021622,0,t3_53rku1,To be honest Im not big on fixing any season regardless of how I feel about it cause for better or worse they all shape the way sentai is today and I always want to see what the creators of the show want to show us. Of course like all fans I do think about fanfic whatifs and other possibilities but for the most part Im content with how sentai is.If I had to choose then Id just pick J.A.K.Q and Gobusters simply because the writers were unable to tell the stories they wanted to tell. Both seasons were changed significantly due to low ratings. Gobusters in particular had a very promising start but just didnt garner the japanese audiences attention. Basically what Im saying is it wouldve been nice to see both seasons how they were originally intended.,supersentai,d7w9abv,2,t5_2skzg

11217980,0,t3_5yz7jh,Pretty good episode this week with all  kyurangers finally being assembled! Seeing them all fight together for the first time was awesome. And the  ranger roll call was epic too as well as the kyuranger allstar crush. It was also cool to see all  voyagers used at once and the  groups taking turns to form kyurenoh.And as Ive been predicting since the first episode Eridrone was defeated the first time all  were assembled.So starting with the elephant in the room this week Stinger finally joins as we find out he is a spy who was already with them who was sent to inflitrate Jark Matter.It at the very least explains why Stinger already had his seiza blaster. And it also explains why how someone who is seemingly as bad as him is a kyuranger cause I definitely think Stinger overacted being a bad guy. And it could also explain how the rebellion are getting all or at least some of their information on Jark Matter.Also Im glad to see Stinger isnt staying on the Orion and is instead staying on Earth to further investigate Orion. That way if something happens Stinger can alert them and can make sure the people nearby are safe at all times. And at the very least we have one less member not doing much on the Orion when not selected by the kyulette. Plus it wouldve been awkward having him and Champ on the Orion at the same time anyway. Theyre probably going to have the two of them come to an understanding at some point while on earth and by the time they leave earth and Stinger boards the Orion they probably wouldve dealt with their misunderstanding.And as I expected we only got small glimpses of Stingers backstory and dont really know much aside from his brother betraying him. At the very least it explains his motives but hopefully we get more of his backstory in the future and for some others too.And with Stinger being revealed as spy it turns out that Xiao already knew. This is further evidence that Xiao knows a lot more than hes letting on as many people are suspecting. Its as clear as day that hes just acting dumb. I mean how on earth did he find all those kyutamas if hes as dumb as seems? And the fact he didnt even mention anything when they were talking about whether they should focus on getting Stinger to join or save earth is further evidence.I also loved Nagas reaction btw which brings me to my next point it seems as though episodes where all  are involved it seems that most of the kyurangers are only saying a few lines for the entire episode. Like I dont really remember Champ or Naga saying anything else other than when they found out about Stinger. And even though I dont hate Lucky like some people I think they give him way too much dialogue even in the fight they gave him his own separate portion where the monster devoured his dream and blew up to the point where half the script is pretty much all Lucky and thats really detrimental to the show.Anyway the episode also seems to focus a decent bit on the two kids wearing light blue amp orange jackets... Im not gonna spoil anything but a lot of people who reads the spoilers including me suspect that at least one of them is going to have a larger role in the future. Itll be interesting to see if they make regular appearances in the coming episodes or show up again later down the line. Also just a side note both kids seem to be portrayed by good actors which is something I rarely say for kid actors.Other things to note are Im glad the ending finally has all  kyurangers and we finally have Champ amp Stinger dancing in the globes. I also liked how Stinger was able to whack all the kyutamas back perfectly with his tail stinger in front of the kyurangers he must have amazing control of that tail stinger. Also now that Eridrone has been defeated I wonder what knew general will step up next. Hopefully theyre more credible than Eridrone and have a bit more characterization and maybe a backstory. Looking at the preview we see Stinger fighting  villains and I suspect at least one them is the new general. And it looks like the kyurangers are already making an impact giving even the adults hope. Hopefully we start to see the negativity of everyone on earth at least gradually disappear I hope they dont start acting all negative again if and when a new and bigger threat appears. Anyway looking forward to next week as always. It looks like well be getting seemingly our first fun and lighthearted episode with the introduction of our first powerup the Pegasus armour which is the dancing star which is our first tector powerup weve had for some time. So it looks like the user will have to learn to dance to master the armour. In the preview we see multiple kyurangers trying to learn how to dance but yet surprisingly we only see Lucky use it. I wonder why Lucky? For some reason I feel that characters like Balance Spada or Hammy would be a better dancer than Lucky. So I wonder why exactly Lucky got it? Was he the one who found or unlocked it? Regardless of what since seeing as though we see multiple kyurangers learning how to dance and this is just a normal auxiliary kyutama I hope we see some of the other kyurangers use this too. And I hate to spoil here even though people would already expect it but Lucky will be getting a proper and more powerful powerup later since this is just a tector and will most likely hardly use the pegasus armour when that happens so I hope at least after then they let other kyurangers use it.Also lastly I hate to be that guy cause I do like the character but I really wish the first fillery or nonkyuranger formation episode didnt focus on Lucky I know technically only the first episode focused on him but atm he just seems by far the most prominent having major roles in every episode. Had they just had  episode focusing on someone else first that wouldve been great. But whatever I still like Lucky so Im still looking forward to it all next week.,supersentai,df3jlrt,1,t5_2skzg

11786017,0,t3_67zo5a,Godai Sentai AuramanIts about time we had another man title. This team would initially be all based on the five elements in Japanese philosophy The members are in ascending order of rank  Chi Brown The typical stubborn strongman of the group. He has a very straightforward approach to battle and his weakness is lacking the abilitywillingness to easily adapt. He represents the Earth element and his mecha is the Chi Cube. Sui Blue This is the most emotional member of the team. He is a strong contrast to Chi Brown in that he adapts incredibly well to new and different situations although he is physically the weakest of the team. He and Chi Brown would quickly become buddies within the team working very well to cover one anothers flaws. He represents the Water element and his mecha is the Sui Sphere. Ka Red He may be Red but he is not the leader. He is very passionate and fights recklessly without giving in. Occasionally this gives the team the edge they need to win the fight but just as often it will put him and his comrades at risk. He represents the Fire element and his mecha is the Ka Pyramid. Fuu White She is very laidback and carefree in nature. She is the wisest member of the team and thir main tactician. She has very graceful movements. She represents the Wind element and her mecha is the Fuu Crescent. Ku Black She is the leader and twin of Fuu White. She draws upon those things beyond our world and uses elements of magic in her fighting style. She is very serious but often seems to be seeing and experiencing things we dont. She represents the Void element and her mecha is the Kuu Lotus.When all their mechas combine they form GorintoAura based on the gorintoThis team has no mentor or additional rangers. I havent given much thought to villains or story but about halfway through they will embark on separate quests similar to Kakuranger and obtain new powers based on other elements which they can switch with their primary powers at will. Chi Brown can access the power of metal and become Chi Silver. Sui Blue can access the power of plants and become Sui Green. Ka Red can access the power of electricity and become Ka Yellow. Fuu White can access the power of ice and become Fuu Crystal. Kuu Black can access the power of space and become Kuu Cosmic.This one would be similar in tone to Gekiranger and Dairanger in that there are still plenty of funny moments but overall it is a more serious story. Also similar to these two is that the sentai fight with an aurabased martial arts channelling their own qi in order to strengthen their fighting style.A godaithemed sentai actually seems kinda obvious so I wonder why Toei havent done it before.,supersentai,dgvzfvx,1,t5_2skzg
