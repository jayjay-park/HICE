255526,0,t1_cf78ju2,What dont you understand exactly? Imagine the white being a peice of paper or card stock and the black being cut out. Its a proper stencil. ,StencilTemplates,cf78o8o,5,t5_2t7dg
350661,0,t3_1y27yh,Youre going to have a couple problems with islands there. If youre spraying the flesh tone first youll have islands on the face and neck. With the green oodles of islands in the pantsboots.You might want to decide which order youre spraying things in then separate out the layers. I know this is your first stencil template and its a good design. It just needs some work to make it practical for cuttingspraying,StencilTemplates,cfh43po,3,t5_2t7dg
647445,0,t1_cgduyb5,Simple. Color the canvas the color you want the knot to be then take a physical piece of paper or plastic cut into the shape of the knot and stick it to the canvas with some spray on adhesive. Paint your background colors however you like when you remove the stencil and youre left with a shape thats a plain color. Then blast the geometric design over it and presto chango.

2836306,0,t1_cnqfhio,Id appreciate that.  The top part is just a .jpg but the area that says STENCIL OF THE WEEK doesnt appear to be an image and is handled separately.  Ive copied the CSS over to a test subreddit before but I havent been able to do anything other than switch out the top section.  Ill PM you with some more info when Im not on my phone.,StencilTemplates,cnqhgau,2,t5_2t7dg

11564802,0,t3_651uke,Guys you dont have to cut and spray this stencil. Downvote if you dont like it. Whatever. But there is no point of reporting this for Threatening harassing or inciting violence. Just move along.. If I wanted to remove for as a Moderator of the sub I would have. But its not worth the report or removing because you dont like it.,StencilTemplates,dg6vj0o,2,t5_2t7dg
