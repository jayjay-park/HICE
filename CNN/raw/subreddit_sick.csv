6707799,0,t3_47dzxf,Clear fluids. Gatorade is good. Broth is good. Herbal tea is good. You can get packages of chicken beef or vegetable broth. I dont think hed want fish broth at this point. Theyre making bone broth now too. I think veggie or chicken would have the mildest taste and the salt will do him some good. Jello is another good option. You can buy it ready made in the dairy case or get boxes and make your own. He can drink it before its chilled and set too. Ginger ale is great stuff for an upset tummy. Its even better if you pour it out and let it go flat. He doesnt have to drink a lot at once. Even one or two spoonfuls or sips is good. Just repeat often. Getting fluids is way more important than food. Ensure is good when he stops puking. Its made with milk so it may be harder to keep down.,sick,d0d56sv,1,t5_2qmai
