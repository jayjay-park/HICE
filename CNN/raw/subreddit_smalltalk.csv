6624282,0,t1_d04d0w9,gt Smalltalk assumes that you never work outside of Smalltalk.I somehow agree with the statement but it sounds like Smalltalk cant interface with the outside world which is not true. For example wrapping a native Library with NativeBoost in Pharo is super easy and integrate really well with the object model.I think the feeling that Smalltalk doesnt integrate well with the outside world mainly comes from the fact that   you can find almost all you need inside  and when you have to go outside it often means you go back to the more classic way of programming. Which make you wich everything would be done in Smalltalk.,smalltalk,d04iaar,4,t5_2qhqd
