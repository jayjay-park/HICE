6335545,0,t1_cz9qmt2,You can do split tunnel on the client vpn for windows and mac you just have to configure it on the local machine. see hereSorry but your title is  a little confusing? The mobile devices do not need any VPN to connect to the MDM for Meraki. It is done through the internet so you do not need a VPN client to get the MDM to work...The other applications you want to use most likely need a VPN. The client works well on Phones and iPads. Not sure about battery drain but with all the power saving features on the phones shutting down the radios it could be  a pain.Hope that helps. ,meraki,cz9s5ln,1,t5_2v8s7

10044175,0,t1_dbgo4hc,The CNAME isnt a bad plan. Our internal and external domain names dont match but I could add another zone to our internal DNS that matches the external domain name then when the VPN is up and DNS is being handled by the DNS servers at the main office Remote Sites dont have their own DNS servers I can just adjust the record for server to point to the correct IP and remove the external CNAME. I think that just might work.,meraki,dbgs5kt,1,t5_2v8s7

11170759,0,t1_dey5ri8,It is frustrating because it leads to users myself included at one point assuming that its legal to use.Why would they sell me and enable a feature whose use definitively violates US law? You know what Im going to write the FCC about that because its messed up.As for the laws not keeping up... this is actually a rare area where theyre extraordinarily well designed. If someones causing you an issue you have other legal means of dealing with their wireless and there are tools available look up WiSpy to track it down. The laws were designed to ensure that all devices after theyve transmitted an RF signal do as little damage to each other as possible. You cannot read intent into an RF signal and have no way to tell whether thats E wireless traffic from a VoIP phone or just some kid running BitTorrent over WiFi. So it was determined that unlicensed spectrum users will have to abide by a certain set of rules part of which determine absolute maximum power output how devices handle interference to some extent the frequencies allowed etc. The design is basically the absolute minimum set of rules possible to ensure devices work as well as can be hoped in an unlicensed spectrum. My reading is that the rules were basically designed by engineers. Theyre efficient at what they seek to accomplish minimally burdensome at least modestly effective... what more could you want?This came up again when that Presidential forum charged  for WiFi and people thought they had a Godgiven right to use their own portable hotspots thanks to the FCC rules. Not so once the RF signal is in the air it cannot be interfered with no deauth packets. However they can track you down WiSpy they can power off your device they can remove you forcibly from the premises for having violated the terms of the agreement you signed in order to attend the forum. The FCC doesnt guarantee you a right to use hotspots whenever and wherever you want the FCC guarantees that if you use a transmitter in the RF spectrum it will not experience harmful RF interference. It all really boils down to the remit of the FCC which is a technical regulatory body to ensure proper use of the public airwaves.If you need a tool to fight WiFi just look in your toolbelt Batman. You have more than just that hammer and this problem isnt a nail.,meraki,dey6zal,1,t5_2v8s7

Such things are not always true.You buy CiscoMeraki because you want the latest security updates as soon as theyre publicly disclosed. As far as Im aware nobody else in networking is as good as Cisco about disclosing and fixing security issues in a timely manner. Often bugs will be revealed and fixed in the same press release or a day or two later.Not everyone needs that level of security but for those that do there are no alternatives in the enterprise space.,meraki,dg5ey1x,1,t5_2v8s7
