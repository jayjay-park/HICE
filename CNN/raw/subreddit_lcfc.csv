7276356,0,t1_d2597pl,He has had to very weak  games in a row. Part of this is because hes been isolated but also because he has failed to adapt or try to take advantage of his isolation. Whats irked me the most are his take ons which he either has looked uninterested or made them overly difficult by trying to scale a wall of defenders. The is always going to be an open man to to pass to when there are  defenders right in front of you. I think he could be brought back to Earth with a seat on the bench. I dont believe that players should be guaranteed a spot in the lineup when the effort isnt been there. Also I think a change would throw a wrench in the works to the opposition if part of their defensive preparation went to preparing for Mahrez and having to face anyone but him. I also disagree with him being half of the attack. Right now I think plan A is trying to win corners and plan B is counter attacks. Mahrez isnt fitting into the game as well now that weve suffocated it. ,lcfc,d259u3x,2,t5_2ukrz

8397636,0,t3_4ucqsl,We know what Vardy and Riyad are about so Ive gone for players to have a break through season.Chilwell  Massive season ahead for him. I could well see by the end of the season that he might be our first choice left back. Looks so calm and composed on the ball and is great going forward as well as doing his defensive duties. Think were onto a winner with him if he signs a new contract. Future England left back absolutely no doubt in my mind. Fuchs has two years left and will more than likely go to the MLS afterwards so I hope he can try and hand over as much experience as possible to Chilwell.Gray  Flashes of brilliance in only short amounts of pitch time. Has pace a trick and awareness. If Riyad gives us another season then moves off to one of the Spanish giants Id have no worries that Gray could slot in. Like Chilwell Im sure hell be a future England player. If he had more minutes on the pitch Id imagine there would be more noise surrounding him like Sterling had. With the extra competitions and being bedded into the squad now Id imagine well see him starting  or more games this season with a lot more time off the bench.Musa  One word pace. Looks very sharp very much like Vardy did when he first came with all the same willingness to run and close down defenders. He may lack technical ability again just like Vards but I really feel hell be a massive asset to us either on the wing or up front and most definitely off the bench against tired defenders. m seems a lot but I think it was actually some shrewd business for a young player.,lcfc,d5r925l,3,t5_2ukrz
8497700,0,t1_d62xmf0,For me Mahrez HAS to play on the right when hes in the center he just goes missing way too often. We saw it loads under Pearson and its so frustrating.On the right he finds plenty of space which he thrives in as we tend to play down the left drawing the oppositions team that way. This leaves Mahrez with room to do his tricks and turns and space to run into.That being said its preseason at the end of the day!,lcfc,d63ri5w,3,t5_2ukrz

Snodgrass was very good.Mahrez needs to push harder with his play. At times he looked like he expected the ball to just go in to the net for him. Musa was excellent and we really shouldve scored in the first half. Gray has some learning to do and King God bless him shouldnt be starting. No time to wallow this one screamed trap game and we bit hard.Dont worry too much about rsoccer theyre just in it for the luls.,lcfc,d6funzc,2,t5_2ukrz
