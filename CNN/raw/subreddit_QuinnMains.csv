4463910,0,t1_cstacnn,Oh that interaction with Pantheon is something I need to try! Ive always been waiting for the second part to gain distance before the E which may not even work since its range is  gt ? since I assumed if you tried vaulting in the first part youd either get stunned in place or hed jump to where you land and stun you.I just think itd be good to have a comprehensive list for people interest to read. D  Here is a cursory list I made for each EDIT the first few champion most of the information can probably be filled out by reading Additional Details for each skill in the wiki but perhaps itd be faster if someone experienced in Quinn filled it out instead? Aatrox Q windup vault interrupts.  Ahri R.  Akali R.  Alistar W targeting Quinn W targeting ally.  Note If Quinn interrupts in both cases then might as well merge these two into one case.  Amumu Q dash vault interrupts.  Azir E.  Bard R windup.  Blitzcrank Q.  Caitlyn R channel vault interrupts.  Cassiopeia R windup  Might finish this later.  ,QuinnMains,cstcr5d,2,t5_37jso

4606443,0,t3_3e22ao,As Quinn your goal is to snowball out of control which is why early powerspikes are desirable in a build. Going a very expensive item with an non complimenting path and meh finished stats for a gimmick the slow you absolutely dont need but is cool to have is obviously not optimal.Also Mallet is a very inefficient item.

PI get what youre saying on the IE rush but basically if Im behindeven or ahead and build IE without cutlass I feel screwed over opposed to botrkboots. The sustain and selfpeel just helps out so much despite not being ideal.By the way  patches ago Quinn adc was really fun to play. But ever since zekes was added its honestly not... You kinda adc from the edge and side of teamfights and use Valor as cleanupescape depending on how it went. Quinn is still the kind of adc who struggles synergizing with most supports and tend to stray off alone.

5207132,0,t3_3m7tyj,I think theyre exploring transformation with another gating mechanic than cooldownmanacosts alone. Like Gnar and Shyv relying on rage and attackspeed.If Valor is a roaming tool it might be triggered by movement out of combat like Deadmans plate or MFs strut.If its a duelingassassination tool proccing harrier might give you a window to transform in some overloadedlow counter playobnoxiously high damage way.If its meant for teamfighting it will either be meant as an aggressive transformation with tons of AoE damage like they originally intended or a defensive repositioning tool like Draven W and Nidas cougar form on roids.I got no clue but I suspect transformation exploration.

5285614,0,t1_cvnaeyr,Yeah but its a bit if a fallacy to think something is  efficient by looking at coststats. For example dorans blade is hugely cost effective but buying it puts you behind on your core build. Same with Sword. It might be cost efficient but its slowing you down to get your BoRK LW Ghostblade. Unless youre getting lot of stacks I find it hard to justify having the item. Also on  stacks its kind of like just buying a BF sword and sitting on it for the rest of the game. The gold could be better spent. I mean its definitely  a fun item and I often buy it with friends. But I cant imagine a scenario where a SOTO would help me snowball harder than finishing CDR boots or BORK earlier,QuinnMains,cvnas16,3,t5_37jso
5298677,0,t3_3nknm7,The early brute serves a duel purpose The first is if your lane opponent builds damage first you melt their face and the second is that all that flat Pen lets you abuse squishies and greedy junglers.The basic rule of thumb is that people like Shen are brick walls and slamming your face into them isnt going to do much more than cause you pain. Shen is especially annoying but the thing to bear in mind is that hes pretty poor when not allowed to roam. Unlike other brick walls where the strategy is to ignore them and kill their family until they get flamed to death Shen is a unique challenge in that his ult isnt much longer of a CD than yours and if you roam he can follow easily. To get around this you want to punish Shen for roaming by taking objectivessuch as his tower or prevent him from doing it in the first place by pushing the lane in and always being in range to vault to cancel his ult.Deep wards negate most junglers and map awareness keeps you safe from mid ganks allowing you to do this safely. Taking TP over ignite can help in situations like this too. Always remember if a tank is building so much armour that you cannot hurt him any more hes limiting his ability to survive magic damage and his ability to deal damage. Also a fast Last Whisper that hurts.Most tanks are excessively mana gateddont have reliable AoE damage to counter push against you and those that do tend to be too slow to contest your roams. If theyre pushed and you roam they can either follow with TP and lose a crap tonne of lane xp and gold or they can let you have free reign of the map unless theyre Shen he can do both.,QuinnMains,cvoytuo,2,t5_37jso

5512660,0,t3_3qla90,Initial reaction is cautiously optimistic. It definitely hurts to lose blind and execute but some of the tradeoffs do sound interesting.Only thing I would really love to see them change is to just get rid of the gimped Skystrike damage in exchange for removing the channel time on Tag Team or giving the blind back but thats probably not in the cards.That being said Im in waitandsee mode. ,QuinnMains,cwgajbj,2,t5_37jso

5514973,0,t3_3qla90,Im open to change but Id really like to think about where this rework is going. Lets not talk about power levels or burst damage or numbers  whats important to me is the feel of the champion. Does this rework preserve what we as Quinn mains found exciting and fun about the champion?I am easing towards no. Blind was about getting in someones face and being able to go handtohand for just a brief second. Playing as Valor might have not been the most optimal assassination for a marksman but it sure heck was fun and we Quinn mains found clever ways to make it work in teamfights and skirmishes. We love the abilities and mechanics of live Quinn and we Quinn mains made her kit viable.In the update Repertoir decided to emphasize the roaming and mobility part of the kit. Thats fine! I like that direction. It preserves a part of what was fun about flying around as Valor. But at what cost? We lost Valor itself. This is a huge blow to her identity. It changes her image completely. For me Quinn was about the interplay between Quinn and Valor. Teamfights were situational and dynamic. Whether to fly in or clean up afterwards to execute with Skystrike or try to hold it to roam elsewhere or to just fly in circles and zone a bit as Valor  these werent just gameplay patterns they were part of her unique identity as rangerbird duo. Now with channel time on tag team we cant safely use it in the fray and Valor is just a mount. Valor is not Willump. Valor is not Bristle. Valor is Quinns playable partner. Even more important than the loss of Quinns identity as a duelist is Quinns loss of Valor as an equal. This is what hurts me the most as a Quinn main.In other reworks like Fiora GP and Mordekaiser Riot found ways to bring new and creative kits to a champion to bring it in line with updated gameplay philosophies. But they did so by figuring out the core identity of a champion and how to preserve that identity among a new kit. Fiora the fast parrying duelist. GP the salty barrel lobbing pirate. Mordekaiser the big metal ghost dude with a giant mace. All of those changes preserved the identity of the champion and found new ways to express what a champion was meant to be.But  uRiotRepertoir what part of Quinns identity did you try to preserve? What were you trying to emphasize? What was your take on what makes Quinn and Valor so special? What were your thoughts in preserving that in the rework? Maybe updated art and animations will make this all make more sense  but what about from a gameplay perspective?In past updates Rioters were open about why champions needed updates. What was so undesirable about Quinn? I have a few guesses she had pretty lowcounterplay assassination patterns and oppressive laning patterns. But would you care to share?I want to emphasize my point at here at the end again. What we as Quinn mains fundamentally love the most about the champion is not her kit burst damage or viability but her identity as a champion. Nobody plays hundreds or even thousands of games of the same champion season after season unless there was something fundamentally fun and exciting about the champion. Season after season with every item update and new top lanejunglers to deal with we find our own ways to adapt with either new mechanics or item choices  we dont move on to meta champions we find a way to make our stylish champion work. I dont want an updated Quinn thats more viable. I want a Quinn that can express herself more straightforwardly and creatively and powerfully. We can talk about which gameplay elements need to be reworked no matter what but lets try to find creative ways to bring new mechanics to the table to make it all work.,QuinnMains,cwgl6qw,2,t5_37jso

6833954,0,t3_49dkhn,The thing here is that you already know what Quinn is supposed to do  create chaos on the map. What you dont see is that you dont need to be killing people to completely mess up what THEY are trying to do. That being said whether youre ahead or not your role lategame is the same Create chaos on the map for the enemy team. So for starters the idea of using your ult efficiently is to splitpush to draw attention and then get out and back to your team for the now unfair v or v depending how many they sent to the lane you were pushing. Whether youre fed or not you got farm from pushing and now the team fight is in your favor regardless. If youre ahead you can go for picks on those trying to push back in answer to your split  causes even more issues for the enemy team. If you got completely rekt early and cant fight anyone dont hold your team back by feeding more kills. Adjust your build accordingly and contribute in a POSITIVE way. That means warding  removing enemy wards keeping all lanes pushed and out of your territory and basically generating pressure WITHOUT fighting the enemy to avoid feeding them free gold. Whether youre  or  they HAVE to come stop you from taking their inhibitor yes? Whether you fight them there or not is irrelevant you forced them to play YOUR game. THAT is what Quinn is all about.

For starters if dmg is the name of the game a crit build would not only be more reliable but be CONSTANT dmg rather than some burst every  mins. That being said Quinn has no issue dishing out dmg in a v situation. No matter what the build arpen crit raw ad bruiser youre going to kill whoever youre hunting down or laning against either way. What COULD go in place of that duskblade though is a stronger utility item. An example being Black Cleaver for HP movespeed and of course the  arpen to help out your team with those tanks. There are quite a few examples like this to aid whatever situation you may find yourself in steraks and maw come to mind.,QuinnMains,d4l4c3w,2,t5_37jso
8096425,0,t1_d4ph7fo,I wouldnt suggest going BC without a zeal item. Being able to stack BCs armor pen faster while not being focused and then E as your first escape when chased and Youmoos as your second escape  best way to go. The odd crits also help. I would suggest PD with a build like this so that you can really fight it out with both the movespeed to chase and the dmg reduction if you end up taking a few hits which goes well with BCs added HP and maws bonus resistance.,QuinnMains,d4q408f,2,t5_37jso

He cant control his ult so if you leave the lane he casts it in then it wont follow also it doesnt go on CD until it dies so you have a long window that he cant use it against you. He also lost the sustain he had in his kit so overall the matchup should be much easier post rework.,QuinnMains,d6yy6uk,1,t5_37jso

8879091,0,t1_d7f4a7p,The very first championship skin was championship Riven which was made to celebrate S worlds. I recall a boards post where KateyKhaos said that Zed was chosen because he has made a major impact in competitive throughout the years even if he hasnt made such a great impact this year.Kalista definitely had a far bigger impact than Sivir did in Season  in competitive. I didnt really play before that so I cant comment on the rest. Championship is tied to competitive victorious to solo queue. I think I recall that they take both into account to different degrees for both skins so a champion with  competitive appearances is unlikely to be victorious and likewise for championship.This season victorious wont be Ryze or Azir or RekSai. Gangplank and Ekko are my bets but it could be something else as well. Ryze Azir and Rek havent had nearly enough impact in soloQ.

9141547,0,t3_55cwd5,I actually talked to Riot Groovylord about this recently. Since its relevant Ill post his response here gtI think theres for sure a version of Quinn that features her and Valor.  I dont think it was her old kit though.  That felt a lot more like a scout girl who can transform into a bird.  Wed have to look at something that makes Valor feel like a truly separate entity instead of just bird shaped missile.  I think Lone Druid from DotA does a good job of this.  He has a bear pet that he can command around and give items to.gt As for current Quinn I think it does a pretty great job of making Quinn herself feel cool.  Shes this mobile scout that flies around the map bopping people.  Sure Valor is not really a character anymore but Im not sure in terms of old Quinns mechanincs that he was much of a character in the first place.I wasnt really able to come up with a formidable reply. I realized I was very attached to this scout girl who can transform into a bird identity. But I think itd be very cool if Valor was something more than just a particle effect.Ive had some ideas on how this could be done. i.e. Changing Harrier into a twopart passive that gives Valor more agency and actually makes him feel like a proper ingame unit. Imagine if Valor had two stances he could switch through one where hes perched on Quinns glove and another where hes in the sky. Maybe each stance could grant Quinn an alternate set of abilities or give her base spells additional effects. What if enemy Champions could attack Valor while hes on Quinns glove? Im working on a rework concept using these ideas. If I ever get around to a final kit I like Ill make sure to share it here and see what you guys think ,QuinnMains,d8ar97g,1,t5_37jso

Yeah you can roam to mid or even bot for a juicy target sometimes but when you play ADC you are expected to match up against your counterpart all game.

However this is not the case in the Triple Lethality build since we are going to be getting all  lethality items anyway. Why? Because of the lethality. The items passives are just bonuses.Since the xLethaliy build is focused on burst rather than sustained damage I dont think lifesteal items fit well into it leaving you with either defensive or pen. This is fine even in other builds we dont get to pick all  situational items and we usually go with the defensive item since the other team will have no or only one tank otherwise why are you building lethality against a tanky team?.,QuinnMains,dbspx12,1,t5_37jso

10349311,0,t3_5o6icw,Your micromacro management must be totally changed. I remember being shocked by the difference from d to d when I was climbing the diamond ladder. You must always think a step ahead. Actually    ... all steps ahead. People in that ELO range usually play with a focus on baiting on controlling vision to decieve enemies on putting pressure at the lane etc. Try to maintain your lane pushed making the enemy jungler come top. If youre able to not die youre putting a lot of pressure. If youre able to kill him andor the enemy toplaner boy your game is going to be easy. Post  try to roam to control the enemy jungle vision. If you can spot the enemy jungler youre taking pressure out of your botlane and making them be able to make a play. If you also kill him or youre killed by him it also works your team can try to do a dragon call. Use your creativity and try to make things less obvious. In this stupid meta the better jungler always wins. Try to use this to your advantage destroying the enemy jungler. Also if behind farm the enemy ADC. ADC in k meme is true they are really useless. Just keep farming them until youre strong again. Also if youre feeling in need of a tank screw it. If youre an OTP you dont give a single fuck about team comp. Thats how SoloQ works.

E on the other hand scales to  base damage but only has a  AD scaling.

But totally winnable.  My issue with Yasuo is that he requires me to focus so much on him I can forget to look at the map.Talon is very winnable.  If youre extreme drop a vision ward.  Otherwise its just a matter of avoiding his damage then going all in to proc TLD.Ahri its about dodging laterally then bursting her.  I.e. her charm is the bulk of what makes her threatening.

11353189,0,t1_dfiknrk,. Whether you get BC Dominiks or Mortal Reminder is mostly preference based IMO. Just go with what works for you best . With Triple Lethality I think rushing all  lethality items is more important than getting BotRK if we choose to get BotRK in the first place. Even if they do have a tank on their team its usually more beneficial to ignore him as long as you can and use the burst from lethality to delete their squishies. That being said Saixos likes GBgtBotRK Im not sure what he builds after though. Needs more discussion imo. This used to be the core build before lethality buffs and right now it feels like the best build to me. Other people have also suggested  lethality items gt crit but I feel like that build leaves situational items such as lifestealdefensivearpen for too late and is too damage focused after all you dont do damage if youre dead. Instead I would suggest just adding a lethality item after DBYGBgtShivPDgtIE only if you are very fed and the enemy team doesnt pose a threat and even then getting a lifesteal item would probably be more beneficial.. Yeah it feels better than the old crit build. Try it out top against teams that are fairly tanky but not tanky enough to warrant the AT builds. Its pretty sweet.. NGL I dont really know much about Jungle builds. In the WarriorgtShivPDgtIE build I can only see it as a situational item  as delaying the Crit is less beneficial than the stats you get from BotRK IMO. Likewise you dont really want to delay the lethality in the WarriorgtLethality build so I would also only get it last.Thanks for your feedback!,QuinnMains,dfiv2rj,2,t5_37jso
