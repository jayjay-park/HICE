5843910,0,t3_3va6vp,Train stores. Or if youre really lucky you have a Hobby shop nearby that has both model train supplies as well as military models. Recreating natural environments is a big thing in model train displays so all of the appropriate grasses rocks cliffmaking and water effects will be found there. WWII model companies also make plenty of pillboxes tank traps machine gun nests and barbed wire. Certain hobby megastores like Hobby Lobby actually consolidate all of these into a single aisle but your local trainmodel shop will have a much wider selection.Also check Woodland Scenics as much of what youll be buying comes straight from them anyway.,TerrainBuilding,cxlnvp6,7,t5_2xy5e
6065416,0,t3_3ylvof,One thing you really have to consider with buildings in particular is if the paint you use is going to warp whatever you made the walls with.  The warping is more likelymore noticeable with heavier paints such as your typical acrylics and other brush applied paints.  Spray paint typically works better for these situations but you also have to make sure that the material to be sprayed will not get melted or react poorly to the solvents in the spray such materials like foam need to be treatedsealed before they are sprayed.,TerrainBuilding,cyeo2j1,2,t5_2xy5e

7619971,0,t3_4jimhe,Hot cutters leave a large kerf. Much bigger than a cold blade of the same thickness. Whether that means you have a visible join depends on how much practice you havejust like a saw you make the cut so the edge of the kerf is on the line you want to cut.Most people cover the joins with some sort of filler or spackle. Hot cut foam has a beautiful edge. You shouldnt need much filler at all.,TerrainBuilding,d38cneq,3,t5_2xy5e

When I started this project I only intended to make terrain for myself  the Kickstarter idea came much later. I have an academic background in mathematics and it just makes more sense geometrically to define a hexagon by the length of its sides since thats the way you construct it as  equilateral triangles of side mm.I did torment myself over whether to make the Kickstarter compatible with GHQ terrain but that would have meant throwing out the hundreds of hexes Id already made.
