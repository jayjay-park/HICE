10144148,0,t3_5l82f2,gt  Megumi more or less died the same way as he did and yet there was still enough of her left for her to become a zombie.Megumi was bit once on the upperleft shoulder. Once a human has the infection in their system zombies ignore them consider also Takahito Kurumi.Takashige was attacked by multiple zombies and the results on the ground suggest that he sustained more damage than a single bite wound.gt  If you look real closely in the background in one of the last few panels of Chapter  youll see the zombies leaving the spot where they just killed Takashige and theres a massive pile of blood on the ground but no corpseTheres a corpse. Heres a zoomed picture.You can clearly see Takashiges hat on the ground look between the extended foot of the zombie on the right and the left hand of the zombie on the left. Directly above and to the left of the hat is Takashiges remains which are a chunky gray when compared to the blood splatter which is black.gt Anyway what Im getting at here is that I think the authorwritercreator might be saving Zombie Takashiges upclose appearence for a special moment. I think that the real question at this point is whether or not Takashige is still in few enough pieces to play the part!gt I imagine that she does still feel bad about killing him and seeing that she also turned him into a zombie would probably wreck her with guilt even further. Kurumi has a weird relationship with zombies. We see early in the manga and anime that she has actively conditioned herself to feel that zombies are no longer the people that they once were. We witness this fall through only once with Megumi and that was because Megumi was a major positive influence on her life a source of support and an unanswered mystery remember they knew shed been bitten not where she went!. I would imagine that a zombie Takashige would be easier for Kurumi to take out particularly now that shes had Yuki give her the you are not them pep talk.Still that isnt to say that a similar scene isnt in the cards for Sino and Kougami!,GakkouGurashi,dbtsbif,5,t5_38bkx

11074849,0,t1_denb0k6,If none of them end up getting actual development and focus though its just going to be yet another reason why I will question whenever the author introduces new characters As if the entire University arc didnt make me do that enough already. I dunno I just want at least one newer character who ends up being just as good of a character as the main  girls and not either a sidecharacter or a plot device. Newer characters can be great and add something new to a series when done right.,GakkouGurashi,denbojf,1,t5_38bkx
