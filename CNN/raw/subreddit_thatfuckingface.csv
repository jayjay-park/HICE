The Walking Dead is a great premise poorly executed. The characters are insipid with no defining qualities to empathise with. The plot rapidly and repeatedly flits between killing and sex with little meaning or worthwhile emotion given to either. This volume is particularly bad portraying every character as sexcrazed. Almost every adult character has had sex often with different partners as if in a world of only  people everyone would just naturally and happily pair off. Carol has now had sex with Tyrese kissed Lori and kissed Rick. It has the plot of a Jilly Cooper novel with everyone wildly having sex with everyone at the drop of a hat and talking in the most clichd way possible about their sexual desire and exploits. I dont deny the importance of characters having sex and appreciate its an animal instinct that could offer some rare enjoyment in an apocalyptic world but the frequency and tactlessness is ridiculous. Their friends are dying all around them and yet they still have wild sexual urges. Im pretty sure thats not how grief works. The female characters are so paperthin and sex hungry that it feels like the writers have never actually met a woman in real life.When they do attempt philosophy or feelings its written in the most formulaic clichd way it makes my skin crawl. The action moves so quickly from one death to the next that often characters arent even around long enough to learn their name let alone get remotely invested in them and therefore as a reader you simply dont care when they die.gt .gt .gt .gt . gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt .gt BOOK....
