11778509,0,t3_669d9z,Thanks for your help I tried to stick to them.However when I got to disk  I wasnt strong enough even to take the second boss out right after Fujin and Rajin.The game just goes crazy tough all of a sudden!Not to mention the Ultimecia Castle and the final boss battle. That things got a fixed amount and a shit ton of HP regardless of the party level which is not how the rest of the game managed boss battles.I know you had to beat the castle guardians to reach her but thats crazy. Maybe the hardest final battle in any of the few FF titles Ive played     and part of  before quitting it lol.,FinalFantasyVIII,dgv4qqb,1,t5_2sl0t
