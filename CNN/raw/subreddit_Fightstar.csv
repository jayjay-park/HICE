5171920,0,t3_3fmyky,Individually I prefer the tracks off Grand Unification. Taken as standalone tracks they all stand on their own really well.But I feel One Day Son This Will All Be Yours has the most cohesive collection of tracks and works best as an ensemble.Even though Im still an advocate of Be Human even moreso the Deluxe Edition reorganisation I still dont think its on par with their previous outings.Lastly I have really high hopes for Behind The Devils Back it sounds very roots in terms of riffs and song structure but with the production value having been seriously upped. And you know these guys made this album because they really wanted to and not because they had to. I think that will transpire through the sheer intensity of the tracks and Im sure that this time next month I might even say their latest album is their beat yet.,Fightstar,cv9encf,1,t5_394f7
