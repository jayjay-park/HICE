210122,0,t1_cewkznv,Could you elaborate a bit on the current state of econometrics research?I only have exposure to the work done at the introductory class level so I dont know how much further it goes.,econometrics,cf2dl12,1,t5_2r93p
323274,0,t3_1xsncx,Yeah just run a logit or a probit. Check against OLS to get the linear probability interpretation  which is helpful and usually not that different. Check OLS against the marginal effects from your probit model. I like to see both presented honestly though its never exactly right and doesnt matter all that much.,econometrics,cfea0lx,1,t5_2r93p

So there is nothing to do about it except copying your successful peers in that class.,econometrics,ciwwm2u,1,t5_2r93p
2246032,0,t3_2ksy6g,This isnt really a question for an econometrics subreddit.  But in any caseOne way to write the profit maximizing condition for a monopolist isPEDPPMCFor example suppose in the simplest case demand is linear PabQ and TCFCQ. Then profit  TRTC abQQFCQ. Take derivative w.r.t. Q set .ddQ  aQbQ F CQ abQCQacbPlug this into demand and we get Pac.  So what? Well we know that the PED for a linear demand is PQ  b ignoring pesky negative signs.  Is this the same as PPMC?  Yes!Using PQ  b  acacb  b acacUsing PPMC acac cacacTadaaah!  This is easier to show for the general case but a concrete example is often fun too. ,econometrics,clpbnsu,3,t5_2r93p

3413453,0,t3_2zawaq,You cant use regular OLS methods here since min.. is not a linear function and thus your system of equations is not linear in the regressors htxt. Youll have to use some sort of maximum likelihood estimator. EDIT I thought about this some more... Leontief is a pretty restrictive functional form and even if you use MLE the loglikelihood function will be nondifferentiable in your parameters. But Leontief is a limiting case of CES production which is differentiable. I think it would be best practice to use MLE to solve a model with CES which will yield estimates of a b and elasticity of substitution. That will at least get you values for a and b and you can also see if your data are consistent with Leontief by testing whether the elasticity estimate is close to zero.,econometrics,cphcwxd,2,t5_2r93p

5335861,0,t1_cvtlbpo,No you cant. But OP didnt tell us whether the data is at annual frequency. It could  years sales data at daily level for all we know!For VAR a reasonable observation to parameter ratio is . So depending on how many lags the OP includes in the VAR and what the frequency of these observations is a VAR an be feasible.I think with limited information what you wrote above makes sense to me.,econometrics,cvtprfv,1,t5_2r93p

5928575,0,t3_3wib2p,Whats your sample size? Is that the issue? How many right hand variables are you using? There is no statistical test that is going to tell in any definitive sense which variables to include in your regression. Youre going to have to decide which ones are the most important to include. ,econometrics,cxwrmx2,1,t5_2r93p

7422277,0,t3_4gyixh,Well there is a lot of econometric tools.Which one to use depends on the specific dataquestion of interest. Afaik there is no such thing as a list of which method to use when faced with what.Basically all the tools have specific mathematical assumptions and hence also some shortcomings. Therefore a fundamental understanding of those assumptions is essential when you want to estimate some stuff.Is there a project you are working on at the moment? I guess we all could be of more help when you could explain what kind of data you are working with and what you want to analyse.,econometrics,d2lv4oa,3,t5_2r93p

10540673,0,t1_dd2ubjn,gt There are no others as my department is pretty small.I meant other papers  gt I did a literature review but most of what I found was on connecting minimum wage and high school enrollment. And whats the methodology they are using?gt My hypothesis is that an increase in minimum wage will negatively effect enrollment for certain demographics and have a negligible impact on others based on which groups are affected by minimum wage.Yes but why? Whats the economic channel? Thats after all what your paper is about so you should be very explicit here. It will also tell you if you have to worry about endogeneity.gt Im doing this in Stata. I can pm the .dta file.Nah Im good ,econometrics,dd2wi53,3,t5_2r93p
