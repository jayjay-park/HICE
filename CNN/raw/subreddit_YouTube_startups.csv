8712783,0,t3_4zcwic,So your review video was really well constructed and I was very engaged for the most part. But here are some things to consider IntrosAn intro is a good way to establish a niche on your channel. Having something on your channel that will for the most part always be the same is good. If you need help with making an intro Im glad to help. OutroAn Outro is also a keen way of establishing a niche and reminding views to check out other videos subscribe and like. AudioWhile my audio is worst than yours you can still improve on the audio of your videos. Consider investing in a higher quality microphone. I just ordered the blue yeti so I can improve on my audio as well. Backgroundinstead of having the game playing in the background trying using royalty free background music. This is another way to establish a niche due to the fact that you can have the same background music for all your reviews. Channel AestheticsYou need to post more and give your channel a little more life. I know you are a new channel but look into your channel art and logo so that new viewers look at your channel slightly more seriously. I can help with that as well if you want.All in all your video was really entertaining and I will make sure to subscribe. Looking forward to great content from you.Also can you give appropriate feedback on my channel as well? It would be greatly appreciated. ,YouTube_startups,d6uqgkx,1,t5_2xhxx
8714370,0,t1_d6usbjr,Thanks for the feedback.I am working on coming up with a logo but having some brain block issues.  I will keep working on that.I have toyed with the idea of adding music to my videos but havent played with it much....will look into that further.I do typically use custom thumbnails using a screenshot from the video itself but I suppose that there are better ways to do that.I do pay attention to the title on most videos especially the how to videos but on the regular update videos that is more for my subscribers so i dont work as hard on those videos since they mostly watch all of my videos any way hope that makes sense.  Still a valid point on the title recommendation though. I use a cannon Vixia camcorder with the on camera mic for most of my videos.  When it is in the budget I will add a shotgun mic to it though.Thanks for the feedback and for the kind words.  I appreciate it all.,YouTube_startups,d6uxmr2,1,t5_2xhxx

9065923,0,t3_54fz8y,gt  How do you get content from online videos for editing?I use this website. Just plug in the URL of the video and download it. gt   Whats the best place for stockmusic and sound effects? Google  youtube. The music will tell you if it is free to use. Usually you just have to credit the artist. gt  Best place for reading up on fair use and other basic legal stuff when putting up content on YouTube?There really isnt one. Fair use is subjective and usually determined by a jury. It only has criteria that must be taken into consideration.  the purpose and character of your use. the nature of the copyrighted work. the amount and substantiality of the portion taken. the effect of the use upon the potential market.Keep anything you use to lt  second clips and you will probably be ok. Keep in mind that is in no way a guarantee. That is just me speaking from experience and attempting to help you out.,YouTube_startups,d81ksne,1,t5_2xhxx
