1024512,0,t3_25tzjc,Write a letter to cedar point? Its pretty much the norm. The people who work there are fucking way under paid.I know a lot of people who work there. Its some of the worst conditions living and management wise. I get annoyed by everyone in the park so imagine being around it all the time. I go to cedar point once a week. I dont know why youre buying food in the park? Its expensive as fuck. Bring a sandwich. My friend told me they are having an issue with their fryers throughout the park. I witnessed one quit working and the manager started blaming the employees. Its not their fault TBH. Its an awful thankless job so why try? They make basically less than minimum wage.  Dont expect line operators to do their job. They dont on dragster especially. Sorry you had a bad experience... but if it was so terrible than go to Kennywood shorter lines for me. I go for the coasters not their brilliant customer service. ,cedarpoint,chkqs39,-3,t5_2rreo
1733406,0,t3_2aa1lu,One time a few years ago my sister and I had waited almost  hours to get on the Millennium so we figured why not wait a little extra for the front... after about  minutes or so we decided to just go in the open second seat and not wait any longer. It was near the end of the year and at night when the bugs are reeeally bad. The two guys in front of us were literally covered in bugs. Their arms were basically black. We were very happy that we decided not to sit in the front...,cedarpoint,cjxns5b,2,t5_2rreo
2088950,0,t3_2irbbc,If you are getting fast passes you wont have anything to worry aboutYou will be able to hit all of the major rides several times and you should only wait  to  minutes per ride. If you are stayingat hotel breakers you will be able to get into the park one hourearly before the public so I would take advantage of that. However you cant use your fast passes until am. Also if youare buying fast passes for one day make sure you pick Saturdayand not Friday. The park is open longer on Saturday and normallyhas a longer wait for rides so youll get more bang for your buck.The haunted mazes are a lot of fun but the scare zones are alwaysmy favorite. I love watching people walk through them and freakingout with someone sneaks up on them and screams. Other than thatthey are pretty fun to check out.As far as signature snacks go make sure you pick up some french fries. They are some of the best fries Ive ever had and they are made at the park fresh each day and I never makea trip without picking up some. Ill be there all day Saturday and Sunday so if you get in the parkearly Ill be on the Millennium Force lol. I hoped this helped andhope you and you wife enjoy your trip!,cedarpoint,cl5co7s,1,t5_2rreo
2115766,0,t1_cl8ohq0,the winds are forcasted at  mph now...the forecast for wind has been rising still..do you think this will shut down rides? I sure hope not . How fast does the wind have to be to slow down the trains significantly where they have to shut down rides?,cedarpoint,cl8rdca,1,t5_2rreo
4786273,0,t3_3gfc61,Sorry I cant help but..... Im about to move from MI to an hour from Louisville.   What is the deal with the parks there?  I can always see an amusement park from  as I drive by..... but then I read about a horrifying coaster crash in Louisville a few  years ago.  ,cedarpoint,ctxuknt,0,t5_2rreo

7240096,0,t1_d214wl9,You can see the old Rip Cord ride is still erected to the right. Is Rip Cord still functional? I cannot find a definitive answer on google and they still have ripcord listed in their challenge park. Youre correct though. Surely the slingshot ride. I honestly think I remember seeing it last season now. Just was confused with the location. Arthurdd youre awesome!  Youre very much correct it isnt new and I entirely remember seeing it last season the color scheme and location threw me through a loop though.     EDIT Just found the answer Rip Cord along with the whole challenge park is permanently closed.  EDIT Actually found another site that states that they only closed two rides in the challenge park is Rip Cord returning for this season to anybodies knowledge? I dont see why they would pretty much build a replacement ride for it and still keep the old one functional ,cedarpoint,d2159uo,1,t5_2rreo

10751233,0,t3_5tl69m,I would drive through Detroit. Once you hit the Canadian side the  HWY while boring is probably the quickest and most efficient. There are also Enroute stops dont have to exit theyre right on the HWY every  Miles or so with Gas Washrooms and lots of food options. If you come in from Buffalo youre going to have to take the QEW Highway which in my opinion is a much more stressful drive and more prone to traffic. No matter which way you take its going to get busy as shit really close to Wonderland youre in the heart of the Greater Toronto Area but if you take the  and dont mind toll routes you can get on the  to take you closer much faster but you get charged.Source Am Canadian have been to CP and make use the QEW all the time when visiting family.,cedarpoint,ddowo9i,1,t5_2rreo
