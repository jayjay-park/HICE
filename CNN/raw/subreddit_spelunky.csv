128018,0,t1_cesvjko,Its just not in the spirit of spelunky. The greatest thing about this game is how random it is. Anything can happen and youre CONSTANTLY being forced to make decisions. Sometimes the game gives you a choice to kill a shopkeeper and get hooked up jetpack mattock etc but with the consequence of having shopkeepers on guard for the rest of the game. This brings us to the crux of the entire game risk versus reward. I dont do score runs I only play the game to kill Yama. Most of the time I play safe saving up money to buy the ankh legitimately. If theres an early shop that has a jetpackmattockbomb box theres no question im going to rob that shop because that particular loadout is not only incredibly fun to play but it also equips me to deal with the angry shopkeepers for the rest of the game. If I had to constantly be buying things to level up the shops this kind of run would never happen. It would always be the same which again is against the spirit of spelunky. I dont want any extra mechanics removing randomness from this game because the infinite novelty is what keeps me coming back.In terms of just completing the game the pacifist approach is just as viable as the shopkeeper murdering strategy. Youre less equipped but you have less actually threatening enemies to face. The fact that high score runs REQUIRE killing shopkeepers is one of those things that I think is really brilliant about this game. You want a lot of money? Cool youre gonna have to fuck everybody up and fight for your life to get it.This is such a well designed game that any time you think well I wish it was this way instead youre probably wrong. You definitely are with this favor system idea.,spelunky,cet0csz,1,t5_2sk9c

1528483,0,t3_2bpcn0,I have two. The first one is copied and pasted from another subreddit and the second I posted on here before.. So what happened was we were in the Mines doing just fine though I had previously angered the legion of trigger happy shopkeepers by killing a shopkeeper in order to steal his shotgun. After learning that you end up going the whole game with them mad at you I kind of regret killing him. Though in the level that followed the exit was being guarded by a shopkeeper as usual while another one was guarding his shop which was conveniently placed right by the exit. This drawing is the best way I can sum up the situation with me and my brother at the top and the shopkeepers at the bottom. As they were circling around my brother had the genius idea of jumping over throwing a bomb down and hoping it would kill at least one of them. There were two very vital pieces of information involved with him knowing this. Number  being You can very easily drop bombs down pits. And  being we had paste at the time which makes bombs stick to walls. So when he did the jump he managed to throw the bomb just right so it ended up right next to me only to land in the pit of shopkeepers and die instantly. It was the true worst case scenario.. Just watch.,spelunky,cj7vez4,2,t5_2sk9c

1694786,0,t3_2dt38o,. Shopkeepers can escape from the web much like you can in which the web fades away this only happens if the shopkeeper is within aggro range.. I actually never tested this I do know that the cobra spit can glitch out a shopkeeper and cause them to stay perfectly still even if they should be mad at you.. There are many things that can set off their aggro for example hired help will always try to escape once you have angered the shopkeepers when hired help leaves the shop the keepers will be set off. In addition any type of enemy damage can set them off such as orange frogs snail bubbles boomerang men ect.. The shotgun as well as other guns has a special attribute in which if you shoot and jump at the same time it will allow you to boost your jump on block higher. Practice shooting and jumping at the same time a bit yourself and you will see what I mean. The shopkeeper when in his tall shaft can sometimes jump out because the happens to shoot and jump at the same moment giving him that extra height aswell. If he had no shotgun he would not jump out.,spelunky,cjsshzr,1,t5_2sk9c

2088302,0,t3_2iqtsd,That exit can certainly be tricky to deal with angry shopkeepers in. Saturnins suggestion is relatively safe provided the shopkeeper doesnt escape the exit. The shopkeeper will jump higher depending on your altitude in relation to him so its nice to keep that in mind. Ive seen the shopkeeper boost jump upwards with the shotgun as high as  tiles before. As well you can always zip through and jump into the exit. Theres some risk involved as you potentially can get grabbed or have the shotgun stun you after the shopkeeper drops it. To avoid being stunned hug the outside wall by the exit left or right.,spelunky,cl59pn7,2,t5_2sk9c

You do however have to be very precise with your landing position on the fastmoving shopkeepers head which isnt necessary using the jump whip method.On the other hand if the level layout in front of the shop is nice and flat  the shotgun drops neatly on its own rather than potentially getting buried in a mound of other items to pick up as is the case with the jump whip method so in certain cases mattockteleporterjetpack shop for instance Ill probably use this instead.,spelunky,cl8g9w8,2,t5_2sk9c

4177286,0,t3_38knzz,I agree with these suggestions.  However I do believe that some of the challenge runs should be left on the front page namely eggplant and low hell.  I think eggplant should stay up because it is a very common challenge and even those who are not part of the community may have heard of or done an eggplant run therefore making mosstier a more accessible and familiar site to other players.  Low hell should stay on the front page because I believe it is the most unique and interesting challenge run we have.  The other challenges could be pushed behind an other categories link.  This page should include the challenge runs other than the aformentioned categores as well as the new Maximum categories.  Maximum should be defined as most people have been running it.  This means going through the Ice caves worm  the mothership.  Since we are creating a new other categories page anyway we could even include True Maximum categores Maximum  Haunted Castle to avoid any definitional conflict.,spelunky,crwez5p,1,t5_2sk9c

Seeing an opportunity to put more of his books back into print he created stretch goals all the way up to I think x his initial goal and ended up raising over a million dollars.

The eggplant can spawn on most levels and I dont think there should be an exception for it to spawn before the Moai.

There can be grey areas depending on what you do and if its fair use. If you were for example selling a skin that was based on some other companys intellectual property then they could certainly sue you for that. Or if you took resources from one game and used them to create a mod for another game that also could get you into legal trouble. In practise though a lot of mods wether legal or illegal just fly under the radar of the companies.I cant find a TOS or EULA for the Steam version of Spelunky so no idea wether or not modsskins would be technically against the rules..

8302247,0,t3_4t83gk,The number one advice I can give you is dont try too hard to go fast. Passing up damsels and boxes simply because theyd take you a couple seconds to get to wont make a difference unless youre going for a real speedrun. The extra safety offered to you by items and health is worth much more than the time lost by getting them. Except climbing gloves. Avoid climbing gloves or get used to whipping walls to avoid grabbing them.Obviously if theyre way on the other side of the map or behind a wall then its not worth it. But if its on the way or right near the exit get it. minutes sounds like a really short amount of time but if you learn how to navigate the levels quickly which youve probably already done on accident! makes the game really quick.  seconds is pretty much average for a level. In the Ice Caves if you get a compass and a cape or jetpack its more like  seconds.You will need to grind for this run just like your hell run. Dont get discouraged if it takes you a while.Another good tip is that the whip is your best weapon. Not a rock not an arrow just the whip. It doesnt use up your held item slot cancels out climbing can deflect arrows and can hit abovebehind you.If you decide to rob the shopkeepers dont bother killing the exit shopkeeper. Stun him with a body or shotgun blast and run into the exit. You dont need the gold they drop.You only need  bombs to do Olmec the safe way. If you find yourself with less bombs you can try the speedrun strategy.Rather than taking a blind drop that goes way down drop a rope. Its quicker than looking down and much much safer.,spelunky,d5fc7ca,9,t5_2sk9c

8813573,0,t1_d779pk2,Because its a maximum low no gold speedrun and resources are really tight on these mothership entrance fast olmec fight random gold that requires bombsropes. On no gold he can do three things  steal a live bomb bad steal ropes good because I can get them back its a bit of a grey area but they are still my starting resources so Im fine picking them back up stun me long stun and potentially dead but maybe just a timeloss. Also I was close to the ceiling on the first one where you cant rope them and thought I backwhipped him on the second go. Apparently not.,spelunky,d779sce,3,t5_2sk9c

9585119,0,t1_d9uj555,Thanks. I wonder if anyone can mod a version of Spelunky to test some of these ideas out. I think if you remove GhostDiamonds altogether the whole game would be too simple and easy for high level players. The way I see it high level play involves undermining all of the games challenges. Once you get a jet pack a shot gun and climbing gloves you are pretty free to just avoid ignore or destroy the level design challenges. Speed running already seeks to ignore and avoid as much of the game as possible. So all we have left to address via design fixes is the high score player. If you remove the Ghost diamonds theyll simply grab all the available gold and gems and move on. If this were the case there would be less room for skill to differientate players. ,spelunky,d9uk828,4,t5_2sk9c
9618215,0,t3_5cqokq,Eggplant has a more central role in Spelunky lore but Krilles No Gold True Pacifist Hell run is my pick.  Part of what makes this so amazing is he achieved this feat one day after Spelunky was featured at AGDQ and Derek Yu asked if it was possible.In terms of runs that at least  people have completed the Shield Run finish the game by crushing Yamas head with a shield is a special one.In terms of runs that havent been completed but really should have been Haunted Max Low Hell is my pick.  Lots of RNG and super resourceintensive... but it should be achievable by a large number of active runners.,spelunky,d9yn5em,6,t5_2sk9c

9993892,0,t1_dba7zfd,Of course. Spelunky is programmed that way but Cave Story is scripted. Thanks for the headsup about the machine gun. I have it but I didnt know it could give me lift.

11009615,0,t3_5x79hw,If you can make it to the ice caves you are doing really well. Getting to and then through the jungle is not easy so Great Job. uFritzMoldanstein tips are great but I recommend buying spectacles. Specs are a godsend in dark levels they help you see. Worth it if you have the coin spare. Otherwise in dark levels take it real slow and careful. Use bombs and ropes to get down to the next level rather than tracking horizontally into all the waiting traps. Bombs are no use to you if your dead so use them. Also this video is amazing for tips and tricks. ,spelunky,defwqpz,1,t5_2sk9c
