10082211,0,t3_5k6i8j,Barre chords are exhausting for your hand when you start out. Depending on who you ask people will say that you are supposed to use your chest as leverage. Something I imported from violin is that your thumb should NOT be hyperextended on the back of the neck of the guitar relax that thumb in fact it should be loose enough that you can use it to finger a note on the low E. The bright side is that you have the hard part out of the way if you are able to get an F natural major barre chord on the  fret. Other than some more pathological examples that is one of the most painful chords to play as far as hand fatigue the frets are much larger toward the top of the fingerboard than toward the bridge which one can check by inspection. If you can play an F barre chord you can probably play the same chord shape anywhere else on the neck much more easily. Ive been playing for years and if I play a song that is just barre chords all the way through my hands still get tired.A last thing to definitely consider is doing some hand exercises  This is actually meant for gaming but they help me a LOT although I play a ton of games too. Best and happy playing over the holidays ,LearnGuitar,dblqcpw,3,t5_2r4jg
