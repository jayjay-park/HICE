512735,0,t3_1zzu2c,If I already have Powerlegs I drop motor and I only have like one piece of Hardware or none at all because at the later levels I have the current weapons I have to go with to the boss at level . I also dont collect nailbox because nailgun have insufficient amount of damage after like level  or What is best between a Teslacoil and teleporter? I you have like  batteryammo I would safe the Teslacoil the weapon ignore armor so It is effective both against big individuals as it slows them down and large swarms of swarmbots. But the Teleporter is like a new chance if you screw something up.  I will in your situation keep both Tesla Coil and a Teleporter and then find something else that is not worth the space in your inventory,teleglitch,cfyjua6,1,t5_2vt64
