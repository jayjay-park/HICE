5791529,0,t1_cxe4anj,Wow mk talk about walking a tightrope! That is fascinating how you are able to handle amp cook the meat daily as a profession. Since the reason you became vegetarian was because you didnt want to eat any animals was it difficult to handle them when you began training for your career as a professional chef?The dichotomy of your situation is  intriguing. And after all these years youre still getting grief for your choice.gtI am committed to my principalsYes you are in a way few others could be.Thanks so much for sharing.,veg,cxezshw,2,t5_2qhat
6977378,0,t1_d16xan5,I agree.  Having all these different subsets for people to identify with can either be positive or negative depending on the person using them.  Identifying with different communities and having a definitive name for them segregates groups in a way that theyre then allowed to feel Im a part of this group therefore anyone who isnt a part of this group is inferior. Not all the time of course.But maybe having a name for these groups in order for people to be able to identify with others will help people be conscious of their decisions and try to change in a positive way because of the fact that they are a part of something.  I just hate some of the vegan people I used to be friends that would make me feel like shit for only being a vegetarian. Like Im a hypocrite and Ill either have to play for the greater good or the greater evil as if there cant be an inbetween.I dont know. Maybe Im just sick of all these labels on everything and everyone. Who cares though.  Whatever helps I guess. Son of a bitch I hate being this high.,veg,d1782is,3,t5_2qhat
