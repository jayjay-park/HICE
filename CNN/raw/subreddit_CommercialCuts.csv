960501,0,t1_chdgmxh,Well this is my art site Just go to the gallery and click the text icons. The rest is photography mostly.And this is my bandcamp Ive released two of three parts to a comedy triptych. It sounds pretentious and yeah it is but its really something different than what other people seem to be doing with their stand up. Mine is a lot darker more serious truer and still a lot of fun. Once all three are released what Im talking about will be made a bit more clear. Whole is greater than the sum of its parts you know the story.Tell me what you think!,CommercialCuts,chdgut6,33,t5_31p4b

980031,0,t1_chdmye8,The song is by Wesley Willis who was a schizophrenic underground music singerwriter who gained a cult following in the s.The film clips are from the terrible s kids movie Mac and Me which was a very late attempt at ripping off the success of E.T. and was largely paid for by commercial sponsorship such as the surreal McDonalds scene used in this video.Someone just combined the two.,CommercialCuts,chforzz,2,t5_31p4b

8576819,0,t1_d6docjn,The biggest distinguishing characteristic between a movie trailer and a commercial is the length. Trailers can be up to  minutes long whereas a commercial can be as short as  seconds or so.Trailers are also previews of a film and dont advertise the film in a way thats similar to advertisements for other commercial goods or services.No one calls trailers for movies commercials even though arguably they may function similarly and the reason ends up being because they are two different styles of advertising.,CommercialCuts,d6dooz5,-1,t5_31p4b
