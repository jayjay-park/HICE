Its not a bad drive on a normal day but the roads have been slow to clear in Memphis and I dont expect  to be too much better.

They are amazing though.Another great place for ribs is Baby Jacks BBQ. The owner has made about seven different sauces and they are mindblowing.  Their BBQ sandwiches are definitely my favorite BBQ sandwich in Memphis.You also can get a great BBQ sandwich at Central BBQ. their BBQ nachos are also amazing.If BBQ chicken is your thing Toms BBQ and Deli has the best smoked chicken wings Ive had in my entire life. Another great place for BBQ chicken is One amp Only BBQ. the chicken quarter or half here is very tasty.As for bars Friday night karaoke at PampH is always really entertaining. It has a really diverse group of people who know how to have a good time. Its a dingy dive bar by the way.Mollie Fontaines is my favorite place to drink in Memphis. Its an old manor turned into a two story bar. There is a bar in the parlor room and a bar upstairs in one of the three rooms. Also there is a huge patio.

4362140,0,t3_3awtct,Im sure the developers in the area did their homework and saw a hotel wouldnt actually be feasible. Since the area is a bit removed from interstate travel it would rely predominately on the entertainment district for revenue. The zoo will always be around but a recession could easily shut down nonprofits like the theaters that depend on private donations and then the hotel would be a bust. With Graceland getting a new hotel and downtown getting a few more possibly the tourist attraction areas will be covered. Overton Square seems to really cater more to locals than to attract out of town visitors. ,memphis,cshcin2,2,t5_2qpqw
4376873,0,t3_3b573x,The Pink Palace and the Minigolf place on Summer Ave are nothing to write home about.  The Pink Palace is mostly a natural history and Memphis history museum. Not much for a  year old unless heshe really likes dinosaurs because they do have a few skeletons and a small animatronic display. The MinigolfArcadeLaser Tag place is pretty overpriced and there isnt really much there for a little kid.My  year old loves the Childrens Museum. Its pricey too imo but good for a visit if you havent been and theres lots of cool stuff for kids to do. They have a splash park outside if youre looking for a water based activity.  If you visit the zoo dont go on a Tuesday because thats free day for Tennessee residents and it is packed and crazy. Also Id recommend parking on Overton Park access it from the Mclean side rather than paying for zoo parking. The pandas sleep a lot but their enclosure is really cool. If you like ice cream Id recommend La Michiocana at Summer and Graham. Local home made ice cream with lots of interesting flavors.The Ducks at the Peabody can be fun if youre in the downtown area. Just look at their website for times. I really like the Belz museum of Asian and Judaic artlots of cool and brightly colored things there that might keep a kids attention. Carved mammoth tusks statues of animals etc.Shelby farms has a huge playground and a disc golf course.The Dixon Gallery and Gardens is one of my favorites. Small nature trail art museum and beautiful gardens all in one place and the best part is its free on Saturdays before noon.Just around the corner from the Dixon is the Memphis Botanical Gardens and they have lots of stuff for kids to do including a big treehouse sprinklers etc.  Feed the fish see some flowers.

His photos did a great deal of that for our readers. If we had limited space then yes I would probably pick the best ones to showcase but thankfully were able to show the album in its entirety.Being an editorinchief isnt about cherrypicking things that I think are interesting. I thought just as I said before that some photos  while not necessarily interesting to my specific interests  might be to someone else. Im happy to report that Ive been correct thus far since the story went up this morning.Also this is more of what I was thinking My issue is more with you as EditorInChief of a glorified blog. I appreciate the distinction with the quotation marks and the attempt to attack a project I oversee because you disagree with me.I wasnt compelled to defend something you directly replied to me and told me why I was wrong in saying these photos were great. I disagreed. gt...how horrible we are for having an education in photography.Oooh that is a bit of a reach. I said people who have a traditional education in photography end up being pretty abrasive  that means the way you approached your criticism that nobody was looking for by the way was abrasive. It was rude. Instead of taking a backseat and letting these photos stand for themselves  especially since he never billed himself as a professional photographer and nobody exchanged money for these photos  you decided to go on the offensive and cite your education as your source.Might I suggest next time perhaps messaging the person privately?

4659694,0,t3_3eqg1v,From the west coast. Its worse in almost every category. The weather is bad though it could be worse I suppose. At least we dont have brutal winters. But theres really only a handful of weeks per year with good outdoor weather. Rest of the time its either brainfryingly hot and humid raining or too cold. Although this year we did have a nicer than usual spring.The constant racial tension coming from both directions is jarring for someone whos not used to it. Its this everpresent feeling of dislike that constantly surrounds you. After a while you just start to ignore it but thats sad.Customer service is terrible. When the best you can hope for as a greeting at a fast food place is What you want thats bad.Theres just not much to do. I know this is a result of the high poverty rate but its kind of depressing. I know the typical Choose crowd will run in claiming theres all kinds of amazing things to do and have you seen the bike lanes?? but I have a feeling these people have never lived in another large city before. The major concert scene is anemic so youre mostly stuck with secondrate hipster bands. Museums are small few in number and not very impressive. We used to get some cool major travelling exhibits in the Pyramid but I guess thats not happening anymore. Malco has a monopoly so movie theaters mostly suck.Its also frankly the ugliest part of the region. You go east to Nashville and Tennessee becomes beautiful with hills mountains rivers lakes all the way through to the Carolinas. You go west past Little Rock and Arkansas turns into the Ozarks. But Memphis and the entire MidSouth region is flat boring nondescript plains for two hours in every direction. At least its green with trees so its not as bad as Oklahoma or the Texas panhandle. The river is cool I guess. At least until you think about whats in it.The one thing that Memphis excels at is the cost of living. Its really difficult to beat it in almost any other large city. Its dirtcheap to live here. The amount of house you can get for your money is pretty amazing and we consistently have among the cheapest gas prices in the country.,memphis,cthwtk4,5,t5_2qpqw

They eventually completed the flyover for southbound I to I but stopped construction before completing the one to continue onto I West. Which is why for the past  years there was a barricadedoff fork on the flyover that led to a  foot drop. From what my neighbor had told me they were originally supposed to complete that part of it in the same project but went so over budget they had to cut their losses stop all construction and essentially abandon it for the next  years.Then TDOT finally started construction again a couple years ago and rolled the abandoned project into a new one that included the giant flyover for eastbound traffic.

From what I am told the Germantown and Collierville public schools are the safest best thus the higher property values. Sending your children to private school or if you have no children provides more neighborhood options. I personally prefer Germantown because its the most organized and clean part of the Memphis metro but to each their own. East Memphis has the best array of restaurants though and Collierville is nice if you want the typical suburban sprawl with some decent amenities nearby. The only sort of trendy area in Collierville though is the downtown which seems to be desolate in the evening. If you just want straight up space than Arlington is fine but I rarely venture up that way as there is nothing of interest. I dont know of any decent retail past Wolfchase or nice parks in that area.,memphis,cvc89zz,1,t5_2qpqw

We can voice our disapproval all we want but they dont legally have to do anything. If him and his parents want to take the school to court over not receiving what they paid for education then they can.

On top of that you would need to do something to get them to see better options than panhandling. A lot of people in that situation see it as there only option for multiple reasons. For a few it is the only way they have experience in for others they might just see it easier to take advantage of others. There are probably a few mixed in that truly need the help but it is hard to tell. There are so many intricacies to deal with. That doesnt mean we should do nothing but I definitely am not sure if this approach they are taking is the best one. Although it is definitely a step in the process. Now as far as drug test go I will meet you halfway. I agree you would need to do a drug test but instead of just disqualifying them altogether instead have some type of fall back to get them moving in the right direction and away from drugs so that they can become qualified. Unfortunately it comes down to how to implement that being the ultimate question.,memphis,d7mnwfj,6,t5_2qpqw

10725179,0,t1_ddm1jex,I guess it can be fun to bash some of these neighborhoods as hipsterburbs but there is a reason that they are not experiencing vacancies in those highly desirable areas despite having significantly higher than average rents.  The same thing isnt going to happen in places where someone comes and slaps up a bunch of poorly designed boring rows of apartments in the hopes that it will be just good enough.  Those areas can be fine enough places to live but they pretty much never become a hub of growth or new projects unless you count long after whole blocks have been abandoned and fallen into disrepair.There is a reason projects like Crosstown are attracting so much investment and attention and I think in the longer term the theory that welldesigned mixeduse areas are the way to go is going to hold up.  I guess well find out who is right when we see where companies are struggling to keep apartments full and neighborhoods safe in  years.  ,memphis,ddm80md,2,t5_2qpqw
