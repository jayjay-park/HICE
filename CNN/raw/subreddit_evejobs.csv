Id rather spend the isk from an SRP program on having a large cache of ships mods etc we can use as needed or as people need something. We already have implemented this but people dont get keys to the palace for a month at least I dont recommend how to make money. I would hope people understand the balance between grind and play. It isnt my responsibility to make sure my members have the isk to pew. They want to pew they know what they need to do. FC training programs. Everyone is different there is no  week to FC training. People need to step up and take the initiative. If they are serious about trying to FC I am a wealth of experience and a rock in fleet in case that person begins to freeze up. Becoming an FC? I feel I just covered that. Take the initiative! You see two guys in frigs in a novice? Get a buddy and go take them on!

We are a smaller  man nullsec corp with  with no playtime requirements though of course we prefer more active players!. Our active timezone spans across the globe though our primary activity tends to be centralized around United States evenings.  Comms tend to be mature both in and out of game and are generally a very positive place to hang!  PVP is our strongest suit though we do many forms of PVE when we arent on fleets! We are very flexible from small gang to large fleet or even blops  not to mention we have an alliance FC program so if you always wanted to lead a fleet now is the chance!   No idea how to do PVP? No problem! We are more than willing to teach though we do expect you to learn! Attitude is x more important than raw skill or SP...though if you have those as well you will be among good company!  PVE tends to include ratting mining with boosts exploration...really whatever you like to do we have someone else who does it and would be happy to join you.   If you do end up flying PVP we also have  a very strong SRP in place to get your isk back if you end up dying! If you join the FC program...you can SRP ships yourself!  In addition to the SRP my corp itself has a few benefits Cheap sub Jita fitted ships on contract  implants for about th what they cost on the open market and free skillbooks even ranging up into some of the more expensive ones if you ask nicely!  Finally if you are worried about moving all of your ships dont be! We have a full jump freighter network available to us for free! If you would rather get fresh ships you can order them through us as well for flat Jita prices seriously!Corp requirements include Slack TeamSpeak and an API before we accept your application.

9932706,0,t1_dawyr1d,Alliance leaders are chill. Fewer rules over how CEOs run their corps compared to other Alliances. Other alliances have limitations on where or if you can build POSs Citadels amp POCOs. MoA lets corps do these but have them to be set up with proper defense. Other rules are common sense keeping track of Member APIs SP requirements signing up for forums not having a bunch of mining fleets during CTAs MOA was in the Heart of CFC space a thorn in their side for years so there is a lot of hate from people involved in in CFC alliances. So that hate can turn to propaganda.  The independence allowed by MOA allows for CEOs or line members to make a goof.  When a line member or CEO makes a goof Reddit will let it represent all of MOA.We are located in Pure Blind. The long time home was zxx. This is the only station for Mordus Legion NPC corp. Alliance has Mordus in the name and Mordus Faction ships were popular in doctrines. I dont think there is hardcore RPing . For doctrines. Intis For Sov war. BLOPS often all race bombers Amarr minmatar are preferred because more DPS. I think I see all race destroyers except for Gallente. I think caldari and minmatar are popular for cruisers.  Minmatar BCs. Rattle snakes for BSs. I think capitals lean shields but Ive seen all races. We have a wide range of doctrines my skills are minmatar caldari so my answer here is leaning more towards what I fly but should cover a good chunk. We have a cheap and fast JF to and from jita and JF uses collateral. Contracts are awlmost always filled with doctrine ships but if interested is your thing there are spots where you could sell stuff for cheaper and make a good income Horde is on the other side of SOE systems Im not sure if the feed the markets or deplete the markets. All that I need is in our SOV systems so a rarely need to go to SOE but sometimes if I see something cheap Ill buy it. MOA is a good place to learn PVP.
