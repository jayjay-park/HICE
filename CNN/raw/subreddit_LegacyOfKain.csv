10240633,0,t1_dc4ohte,I find it unlikely that Moebius and Mortanius could successfully rebel against other  not eight  the Reaver Guardian was a secret to almost everyone or even  if Malek was the third rebel Guardians and their Ancient masters. I find it more likely that the whole Circle from that time revolted and Moebius Mortanius and perhaps Malek were only leading them. Then again the only thing we know for sure about Circles rebellion is that Moebius and Mortanius were involved.,LegacyOfKain,dc4tzsy,1,t5_314nj
