486025,0,t3_1zomn3,A LOT of this rang really true for me growing up in a regular nonReformed evangelical church.  And it rang true to me too as mistakes Ive made!  Ive definitely been guilty of elevating fellowship over the point of studying the Word especially as most of the Bible studies Ive been directly involved with as a leader have been playgroup studies attempting to reach out to moms.Thoughts? What would you add to this list?  What have you experienced that really worked in a Bible study format?,reformedwomen,cfvijbj,2,t5_30l7l
679215,0,t1_cggxdmd,Dinner at my house is a bit insane too. We have a  month old and a  month old. Usually it involves trying to gulp down food while stopping plates from being thrown on the floor and rushing to finish eating before the baby wants to breastfeed! lol,reformedwomen,cghh6xk,2,t5_30l7l
1090530,0,t3_26gsvf,Ill preface this with I am not a mother yet but Ive been a full time nanny a frequent babysitter and have some younger cousins. and  are generally old enough to be taught not to interrupt Mom while she is sitting in place reading her Bible for amount of time just as they should not interrupt Mom when she is in the bathroom with the door shut. This takes practice repetition and consistency. Dealing with interruptions is also crucial. My sister and I were taught never to verbally interrupt my mother but just place a hand on her arm. I still find myself doing this with my fiance its a simple I have something to say when you have time to hear it.poodaygraces advice is great as well Ive used it when Im in the middle of stressful times and finding it harder than usual to focus or when I run into morning difficulties and cant fit in my study before I have to leave for work. Ill take one verse out of the however many I need to read before Bible Study that week and just meditate on it when I have some mental space. Yesterdays was  John .,reformedwomen,chs8vkh,5,t5_30l7l
