7940409,0,t1_d489fju,I have a list of  Tiny subreddits of the day updated daily and  Subreddits of the day also updated daily. They are not files on the internet though. If you mod the bot for wiki access it could keep two lists in your wiki updated. They would need their own page each and they are not categorized but in the case of srotd they would have a link to the corresponding feature.    ,ListOfSubreddits,d48kr2x,2,t5_32sxp
