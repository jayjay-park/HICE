Clearly at least partially a US program given subcaptain Cal being evidently an important figure in Pinger history.  I suppose that conceivably she could have been headed undersea given the noleadersinspace treaty and the accelerated Hard Rain screwed up the plan by compressing the time window to get underwater but you would have thought she might have mentioned at some point hey wonder how those underwater dudes are doing? given everyone seemed to know all about the miner dudes. ,seveneves,ctkqdmk,1,t5_33wcg

8904075,0,t1_d7i3td7,Good point perhaps Julia had a mental illness. But I think the way she was written her world view and rationing process was broken and not based on science. So perhaps that is a mental illness but its not quite the same as stuff out of DSM.This explains why the Julian was the traitor as the lack of reasoning was genetic and something that Julia actually chose to pass on. It was the selfish only perception matters type of reasoning that Julia carried through her descendants.Thats an interesting idea about a nuke coming up. What is the advantage of blowing up the cloud ark? Would you want both American politicians? Why would Julia need to kill Pete if it requires two people to arm the nuke? Couldnt she just not enter her codes? Perhaps she didnt trust herself.,seveneves,d7i53dj,1,t5_33wcg
