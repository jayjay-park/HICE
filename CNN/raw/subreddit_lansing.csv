9125377,0,t1_d88mpnc,I used to ride the  to Okemos every winter it takes an hour from where my stop was. Really ate into my already low free time especially on  late shifts. Wouldnt the aim of rapid transit be to get people places quicker? Idk about pushing people to certain businesses. This is Michigan if you arent making awkward left turns half a mile from your intended destination then something isnt right. Joking aside I see the median issue this would impose working fine in other cities there hasnt ever been a Michigan left thats deterred me from stopping one place over the next aside from gas stations. ,lansing,d88pzit,4,t5_2qnvu
