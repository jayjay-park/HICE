Some plays I can tell an awareness loss but most of the time he is doing better than every DE I have tried but  Watt.  On half of my blitz plays one of these guys are hitting the QB and causing fumbles injuries or picking the ball off.  Even with the awareness loss he is still  at the other positions and if you control one of the ends that awareness is a non issue.  Usering him at DE to stop the read option usuially leads in the other guy quitting the game and fixing his broken CamCapPaytons broken collar bone after the game.  ,MaddenUltimateTeam,cff7bed,1,t5_2v23y

495864,0,t3_1zsso6,To be honest Polamalu played well when I was using him. Hes best utilized playing closer to line of scrimmage as he is a very good run stopper. Hes made several one handed catches for me playing in a yellow zone or out in the flats and hes always making plays in the back field against the run. I upgraded to Ronnie Lott because I wanted a better safety playing deep and in man coverage. To answer your question Ronnie Lott is probably the best card to get. He has the speed hit power coverage and size to make plays against the offense. If you dont have the coin try out Dawkins. Dont count out Polamalu though. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,cfwmtet,1,t5_2v23y

587260,0,t3_20u2ig,Ive never used any A Rod cards but Ive heard nothing but good things. Even with my MVP Cam Newton I rarely run with the qb. I too am more of a pocket passing style player but just having cam out there gives my opponent one more thing to worry about because I can always throw in a read option or qb wrap or even scramble when the pocket collapses. It is definitely a nice option to have up your sleeve. Also how is that Super Bowl Brady?

588864,0,t3_20uxz9,So I can offer up some selling advice. . Make a post where you directly post the pricerange you want to sell for.. Check their post history before even beginning any talks of buying.. Based off your personal level of trust inform the buyer who will be going first and if its a huge coincard deal break it up so noone can get scammed.. Paypal is a great and secure way to transfer the money.. Make sure you constantly update and communicate with all buyers.,MaddenUltimateTeam,cg77huw,2,t5_2v23y

754078,0,t3_21s5qn,I wish I had more time to delve deeper but the bottom line is find a market where you think people are going to be interested in it for a while.  Like if you had  million coins you could buy every  Pat Peterson that gets listed for under k and sell them at k.  If the market started buying too much of your k listings then raise the price.

798403,0,t3_239rr5,I have a few tips on what to avoid rather than how to succeed because basically you have to start with some of the collections to make them profitable. Some MVPs are cheaper to buy than to collect the cards and some of the collections can get pricy.  Check each price of each card on muthead.com. Go to muthead.com then click on collection. Then search the collection you want to do and it will show you each card and the average price of each card. You want to make sure theres no card that is rare and therefore expensive. People dont the mvpeterson collection soon learned that certain cards were going for k or more for just a single card.   You have to be patient. Prices of certain cards can vary pretty widely and there isnt always a pattern. muthead also has a collection manager that you should use. register for an account and itll save your progress. You need to buy a card here buy a card there to ensure you arent over paying for cards. My rule of thumb is that if its more expensive than the muthead price I will wait. If its cheaper I buy it.   Wait out the rush sometimes. I was at home when they announced the mvp collections on break so I scooped in and bought the elites for a few collections and was able to do them for way cheaper than most. People jack up prices when they realize their cards are in a collection. You saw elites going for k instead of k the day before. However if you werent at home literally when it was announced and dont have a head start then its easier to wait out the rush. Its good that youre doing the mvp collections rather than the position collections cause I think prices have stablized a little bit.   Do collections when you have some or most of the collections cards. Look in your reserves and see what elite gold or whatever you already have for each time. Do those collections first. With all that said certain collections were easier when I did them a while back because they had fewer elites. Jaguars Giants Raiders Browns etc. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,cgv154c,1,t5_2v23y

Zone boosts.  Run stuff chem zone chem speed run chem. Then there are times I dont at all. I personally have been rolling with zone defense and sped run chems. This is my favorite combo usually. Or zone d long pass. I love zone d chemistry as I feel it works most of the time. The boosts however on uls I sometimes dont believe exists or not. Case in point.

1270448,0,t3_28n1fw,Depends on what Gen you are using actually.   If you are using Current Gen I would say neither. I see that you say you have Base Legend Payton. Hes actually really good I had been using him still for a lonnnnnng time until today but I also had a couple of players out there that basically were giving him  ACC. He trucks very well and is reliable in that he doesnt fumble very often.  Current Gen players you want someone with powercarrying over speed. I have a lot of running backs but probably my most favorite running back and most reliable guy Ill go to if I want positive yards no fumbles and I want to just grind my opponent down is the  Marshawn Lynch His stats do not represent what a monster he is and I play against  teams all the time and I dont know whether or not you can still complete his collection but that might be a good alternative at your price point. Ill say that when he is on the field he also gets a ACC and ELUS boost from other players in the way I use him but he trucks EVERYONE.,MaddenUltimateTeam,cicjj8w,0,t5_2v23y

So youre trying to get to . I would do as many as you can to get the reward players from each style you can use some of these to help with other styles since they are dual chem. signature cards help a lot double RS cards can get you  chem thanksgiving elites are cheap right now ... They are all dual chem Ive used some of these. A lot of it is a puzzle play with your lineups see what gets you close and buy only what you need. Go to Muthead and look at the lineups tab search by both styles you are trying to complete this will help you know what you need. Word of caution though these are a coin drainer. I started with an  ovr team and about k. Ive had to stop a few times to make back some coin. You gain the coach you bought when you complete each style so selling them both before moving on to the next one helps. I thought it would be impossible when I started but it gets easier it just takes time and coins.,MaddenUltimateTeam,cmjowbj,1,t5_2v23y

Like theres nothing more frustrating in FIFA than having a strong strikerforward who can just bull doze through your entire defensive line.

But I still have like . million coins so I should be good for Moss whenever the fuck he comes out. Its pissing me off that theyre waiting so long putting up bullshit legends of current players and shit. So annoying.Anyway this was the first game I played with my new additions. One of the craziest games Ive played for sure. Fucking FS Megatron is ridiculous. That closing speedlong arms. Then he gets a crazy TD and I tried blocking his PAT because Ive been blocking a ton of them lately with HB Tavon Austin. If you time it correctly he is quick enough to get in there and block it. I obviously fucked up the timing and he converted the easy pt conversion.Watch the whole thing including how badly I get fucked over on the kickoff after he takes the lead. I fair catch it and he just fucking drops it and of course its on the one yard line. I have never seen them just straight up drop a fair catch for no reason. Then Ive heard so much about  Gronk just catching every jump ball thrown to him and while Im not big for just throwing it up and hoping and praying even though that seems to be a legit strategy this year for some reason like some are I didnt really have a choice at that point and well youll see what happened.

2888195,0,t3_2t7ee4,I will first say that I respect your opinion and you have the right to have it. That is an interesting theory. However I think most of it is completely false.Although it is possible that EA planted people to post good pulls I find the act of planting people a bit ridiculous and low. They repost good pulls on their Twitter page but to falsify good pulls is in my opinion a silly theory and highly unlikely. Too much effort.Also although it does seem like youtubers get better pulls I do not think EA has the ability to alter certain peoples pull rates. I know Mr Goldensports Cullenburger and iMav do not get great pulls they just pull much much more packs. They dropped maybe a thousand dollars on this game Im quite sure.One theory that is quite popular is the equalizer theory where people with worse teams get a handicap.,MaddenUltimateTeam,cnwe31m,4,t5_2v23y

3244018,0,t1_coy0wvv,Unfortunately the only way of reverse engineering this information would be to do a ridiculously large analysis trying to isolate the impact of each point of difference for each position like finding players that are EXACTLY the same except one has  speed and  OVR which is way more time than anyone wants to put in. In statistics this is called a Design of Experiment and helps you isolate the individual impact of variables.    Thats no fun though because when you get it perfect you will just be generating the actual ratings the players have in Madden which we already know.        The best way to use this spreadsheet would be to use it to compare what is important in YOUR offense. Generate your own ratings for players by manipulating the percentages.    Maybe you always roll out left? Then your LT Pass Block is probably going to be worth . Do you throw fades all day? You probably want to bump up your receivers speed and spectacular catch percentages.    Then it would let you pick the best fit players for your offense.,MaddenUltimateTeam,coy90qq,1,t5_2v23y

I have Blount on my budget team as well and hes a tank but was a little too slow for my taste.FO Flacco is not a bad budget qb.  Great throw power and short and medium accuracy.

If I get sacked from holding the ball too long on a blitz then now Im playing into my opponents hand by making it rdand and he can just run man zone and my odds of continuing my drive drastically go down.If Im completing these open flat routes usually at minimum  yards.

3494414,0,t1_cpqflay,I respectfully disagree and I really dont get why you would down vote my comment just because it challenges yours. Nevertheless I will not down vote yours... Back to the point of all this... If anything it would stimulate the economy. In your example you are talking about  billion coins distributed evenly accross a user base of  people. Each user gets  coins to start the year... do you really think this would destroy the economy?In real life the government distributes money to people through all kinds of social programs. The amount of money spent on these programs is astronomical. In many cases these programs are designed to benefit the rich and result in an unequal distribution of wealth. And yet none of this destroys the economy... ,MaddenUltimateTeam,cpql6nu,1,t5_2v23y

3511962,0,t3_30hw8o,. Market prices are determined by a number of factors such as card rarity  hour only limited edition players demand for that position and most influencing on the market would be huge promotions. Right now Golden Ticket releases have everyone ripping packs so the market has recessed. . Theres the weekly change in packs available but the biggest promotions are generally centered around holidays or events ie. thanksgiving christmas NFL draft. The best way to play the market is to do your research on card values and be patient. Youll spend hours refreshing the auction house to get a few snipes but they can really pay off. . There is a lot of excitement here yes. This is the best sub Ive been a part of and a great community. Just be respectful and youll get respect back. Its a pretty chill sub.

Either you play him at ROLB but then you have to boost the catching and not make it  points lower than the AR Mack. Or you play him at RE would explain why catching is not boosted but then why would you boost zone and man coverage and dont boost the power moves?It seems like he couldnt decide where he wanted to play him so he just made a shit card.,MaddenUltimateTeam,cq9tm9k,10,t5_2v23y

He will fumble if you take big hits like any scrambling QB but he fumbles way less for me than Steve young did and you can usually beat the guy chasing you and make it to the sideline. A lot of times when people see him on your lineup theyll automatically move to QB spy which frees up some space on the field for your recievers. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,cqozxu1,1,t5_2v23y

Personally I think White or Cooper would play great with Carr given that hes pretty fresh on the scene and still developing as a player this is the ideal time for a QBWR combo to start learning to compliment each others styles.

When I was down by  with  seconds left in the game and this happened. I have the screenshot still because I submitted it as a post a month ago. About  months ago I threw a terrible interception.

4102870,0,t1_crnwdyb,Ive played a bunch of top  guys and he is by far the worst. I ran Cover  Sky almost every single play this is the SAME PLAY he is raging about but kept manning up a flat on his Jerry Rice who he was playmaking after dropping back  yards with Vick. Thats what was driving him crazy because I guess that play was his cover  sky beater and he couldnt figure out why it wasnt working. He relies on play art for most of his adjustments to he cant read plays for shit. I originally was doing a nickel  wide defense to keep him in the pocket with both OLBs blitzing and no flat protection but because he can see the play art he was adjusting and abusing the flats with Bo. When I switched to Cover  Sky and just turned it into effectively the same play with no flats protection and both OLBs blitzing.. he started rolling out again right into my contains. Then hed pause and send more messages. After he raged out he started sending me messages asking me to meet irl and fight him. I only wish he got on the mic. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,crnyal6,2,t5_2v23y

I currently work at a hospital as a nursing staff and personally I would advice my cancer patients with conditions like yourself to keep your personal life to your personal life. You dont need the extra drama in your life. I tell my patients that most people will not understand what they are going through and it is best to keep your personal life your own. Its as simple as that. If not youre gonna run into people who are uncaring and hurtful. My suggestion would be to personally message your friends on here rather than posting openly to all. Posting on this sub your personal difficulties is only opening up a door for people to hurt you. Right now in your life you dont need that you need to heal. Just some advice from someone who has been in the medical field for some time now.  Good luck my friend. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,croup84,5,t5_2v23y

If you want to make a deal with someone THAT badly they can just sell the players that they had planned on trading you and buy them from you with straight coins. If the deal seems to good too be true thats because it is.Only thing I am concerned about is kids that play the game who are niave and just dont know better yet.

4431391,0,t1_csp87oa,If you dont mind me asking on what basis is the assesssment of American Parli? Also World Schools has  almost no element of BP in it oncesoever. I would know I have already done BP at the college level though I am a high schooler. I completely disagree with your assessment of topics in the format based on my experience. Spreading never occurs  nothing is able to legitimately be  preprepared and win in the format in relation to arguments and all closed motions are based on the status quo with most open ones being interpreted to argue a fundamental problem of the status quo. Policy is literally a bunch of spreading  mostly and is one topic a year.  I dont consider reading cases word for word as debates which is why I hate policy.  Its actually dieing out in California slowly as a format. You can cheese in any format really fallacious argumentation. Also abusiveillogical valuesPOV.  That said I meant I got a lot of practice and has as much debates in a week as there is cheese in MUT. Sorry for my lack of clarificationIm not trying to start a debate but more so just want to clear up certain things said.

4786388,0,t3_3gfm2b,The problem here is that the catch engine sometimes determines if a pass will be completeintercepted before the animation takes place because some animations are ALWAYS drops and some are ALWAYS catches. In this instance he got a guaranteed catch animation interrupted by the position of another player meaning he didnt end up in the path of the ball in time. Because it determined it was an interception already the trajectory of the ball adjusted to maintain that probability. While this seems unfair to the person on the other end it actually prevents pass interference in many cases because a corner cant just run into a player who is maneuvering for a catch and knock them off path. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,ctxv3f0,1,t5_2v23y

They did it now so their PR guys have an excuse not to respond.  If it causes way too much of an uproar theyll claim it was a glitch.  If it causes enough of one theyll say it was a test and theyre moving it back they did this with AH increments last year.  If it doesnt well get more news on Sunday when most of us will be watching football.Besides that if they tell everyone someone like me could go buy out all of the elite badges.  Why would they want that when they can give their friends a heads up first.,MaddenUltimateTeam,cuysya0,5,t5_2v23y

5139998,0,t1_cv5k1u2,Jamaal didnt lose them the game. Andy Reid did. Theres no reason to try to go for it with  on the clock on your own  and tied. Just because we would do it while playing Madden doesnt mean its smart NFL football. Shouldve had Smith take a knee and take your chances during OT. Peyton looked very beatable all night and their D had held it down for the most part. Jamaal shouldnt have even been given the chance to fumble dont put that on him.Edit And Smith threw a pick in the red zone leaving points on the board. Nobody is blaming him for the loss though.,MaddenUltimateTeam,cv5k8ux,12,t5_2v23y
5140469,0,t1_cv5m6pp,Why? Charles had already fumbled. Why would Reid trust him? What was he expecting? That Charles would bust open an  yard TD run? If he was trying to be conservative and burn the clock why wouldnt he kneel? It was first down with less than  on the clock. He had zero logic behind running the ball. Running the ball risks a fumble. Kneeling involves no risk.Seriously its like people dont understand football fundamentals here. If it was a pass play that got intercepted that could be forgiven. But a run plan makes absolutely zero sense and Reid still called it despite knowing the fumble risk which was apparent from the previous fumble. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,cv5mabg,5,t5_2v23y

5252119,0,t3_3mx0zi,Buying out the AH and posting them back up for a higher price is not a smart move. The intelligent seller that wants to get rid of their card will never post their cards for . times higher than suggested price via MutHead or MutManager. As they understand that most buyers are smart and will avoid  buying any card valued at . times the suggested price. Also you must note that cards are pulled everyday and the availability of a card is most of the time constant and therefore buying out the AH does not mean you own all of those specific cards.  Price is fixing only realistic when there are only a limited amount of resources in this instance a card and you must own all of it. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,cvj2hu8,0,t5_2v23y

5275602,0,t1_cvm0678,Hahaha. Yeah I recognized the irony of the stats I tracked. But I had to go with what my eyes could see. And watching one DT getting pancaked every play and one being driven far back by the double team before the center slipped off and blocked the MLB offered more evidence than the stats could provide so I basically ignored them at the end.  My only explanation for it was that the LBs didnt get stuck running behind a standing DT and instead had a free shot at the RB once the middle was cleared of all DTs. It works when youre in a  cover  invert but not so much when its cover  man in a dime formation and theyre running inside zone.,MaddenUltimateTeam,cvm0nue,2,t5_2v23y

5424983,0,t3_3pbs4f,My SO and I dont really play video games together outside of Rayman Legends since she likes the teensies but I think the thing that keeps us strong  years is doing things together to connect memories.For example I live in north NJ and never been to an Eagles game in the Linc.  Last week for Saints  Eagles I got to go because she took me.  I will always connect that with her for the rest of my life whether or not we spend the rest of our lives together.My suggestion to you  Find things you can do together that you can forever connect to one another.  Most of the shit doesnt even have to be expensive My GF and I go hiking a good amount and have been hiking in  states before I met her neither of have ever been hiking.  Just shit where you can look back someday and only be able to associate that thing with this one person.  The mundane stuff is fine but you need events to associate to each other.NOW GIMME THAT TEBOW!,MaddenUltimateTeam,cw53j5z,2,t5_2v23y

5668144,0,t1_cwzkz59,I think that may of been a bit much xb I think they were in the mid k range But if you planned on doing it this weekend The prices on legend badges were selling fast at k plus a piece earlier tonight And on the weekends the badges as of last weekend were hitting above k each. The weekends are the worst time to buy LBs So you may not of scored on the card but you didnt get ripped off or even lost IMO. But the amount of hours when the market is hot to snipe the badges are brutal and there is usually a lot of competition. If your time means something to you you did just fine. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,cwzot48,1,t5_2v23y

5811431,0,t1_cxhg6op,gtI dont believe retired players are part of the NFLPA anymore.Whats the basis for that comment.  Is there something you heard or read giving you that impression?  Or are you literally making up an opinion on the fly with no basis in fact?Retired players are very much a part of the NFLPA.  If you visit the NFLPA website you will see the first two links at the top of the page say Active Players and Former Players.  The NFLPA provides lots of benefits to its members even in retirement.  Which is typical for most unions the term association is a misnomer the NFLPA is a union.For example... the NFLPA offers a joint replacement program and a spine treatment program for its retired members.,MaddenUltimateTeam,cxhgojx,-3,t5_2v23y

There was a couple that I would just get stuck on even though I couldnt have played it much better. Id get them like th and  and backed up to the  yard line. Id rush in lined up for sack hit power tackle and theyd make a miraculous play to burn me. Any time this happened more than once Id take a break and comeBack to it.

6105576,0,t1_cyjcix5,What I learned from this sub. Get running back Dri Archer he has  speed. You get him from winning the first journey solo just one game. Buy another cheap running back with good speed. Get a playbook with the strong close formation. Pick the quick toss play. You need the  because theyll get worn out from the abuse lol. Theyll sub for each other automatically. Put Archer as your punt returner also. Run the play punt block man on defense. Control Archer yourself and line him up at the edge of your line with a little space between you and your teammate on the edge. Be ready to explode off the line and head straight for the QB. Lots and lots of sacks and occasional fumbles. Try it out in practice if you need to. Your D will be in man coverage so it helps if you have cornerbacks with good speedman coverage. Theyll complete one now and again for a chunk of yards but youll succeed enough to override that. And do the journey II solos first. Pretty easy and great rewards. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,cyjn3zx,1,t5_2v23y

If it were me Id always go with scenario  as upgrading to Porter and Barron will make a much larger impact than Kuechly because generally a larger amount of good players is always going to be more important than one stud and a bunch of middle of the road guys. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,cypdndn,1,t5_2v23y

6164558,0,t3_3zzskv,OOP Poe is the best FB in the game. The dude definitely does not play like a  pound lineman when it comes to his speed or agility. He is in front for every run when and where he needs to be he knows who to block and he knocks linebackers flat on their asses when blocking. In addition if you throw to him or dive with him he is a god damned bowling ball and a dive will get you at least five to fifteen yards every play. Had Neal and am way happier with Poe and didnt mind the extra coins from selling Neal off for his new replacement. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,cyqci6h,2,t5_2v23y

6208451,0,t1_cyvbvpb,But thats my point man. Hes only here for self promotion. He doesnt make videos for the sub like gutfoxx and embry. He makes videos to get paid and then poets them to sub the after. What were saying is that we dont mind when guys post there YouTube and also actually participate in threads. Tino literally asks what players he should review and then makes the video for is. Embry has a shout out to us in his top  and he also gets the clips from the users here.

Your REs job in a  should be to attract double teams so LT is in a on situation to blow up the run or pass. Same on the other side for LE and Miller. Even someone like base Casey there is effective for very cheap. For RT look at Clabo or Ogden now that his price has plummeted. TOTY Talib or TOTW Sherman in slot.

6424676,0,t3_43p97z,Yes and no.While of course if you throw into coverage it doesnt matter who your QB is hell get picked. Thats  accurate but the throw power and accuracy is important to getting the ball on time and in the right spot so its not picked or swatted away. I downgraded this weekend from RTTP Brady to ToTW Stafford. Not a huge drop mind you so I figured it wasnt going to be an issue in the slightest and overall it hasnt been. However I have noticed a slight change in my RAC catches routes. Brady could hit them in stride on every play and put it out in front with room to run whereas Stafford throws just a bit in front to the point where Im getting new animations for my receivers to corral the passes. Again not a huge change but when you get  less yards because of it it makes a difference. Also he has the tendency to overthrow out routes a lot more than Brady did even when theyre wide open. The main thing people forget is that you can essentially make Rodgers yourself with a good LP or SP chemistry. I had forgotten this fact but looking at it if you have someone with great TP adding  or  to Throw Short Deep or Medium will make most QBs unstoppable. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,czjujzm,1,t5_2v23y

If you did watch some of their games you would know that they used a lot of man protections RB and TE help the Oline block when passing so a lot of the credit of the oline should be diverted to them having a numbers advantage when blocking. Not because of an all star O line. Its  on  rushers a lot of the time. They win. Russel turned it on in the second half of the season. Cams been on all year even after losing his  WR.

Youve got to have a diverse scheme not calling and throwing the same read more than a couple times a game. As soon as you use your money play it has been exposed so you likely cant use it again but you can take advantage of your opponents reaction to it. Thats what its about more than the personnel.

6562742,0,t3_45hxjv,. Call a formation with at least one TE. . Max protect as soon as you break the huddle. . When the line is set slide protect toward the blitz Incredibly easy to identify because they have to manually move the OLB further outside for the blitz to work. . Hot route any RBs however youd like. The blitz will be picked up by the five lineman and TE. You can even leave them blocking if you want to buy extra time to throw deep. Cover  usually means on down field. . Profit. When people call this play they leave massive holes in coverage. Flats are always open. Cover  shell which is easy to pick apart when you know its coming. If you use a mobile QB and they dont include a spy you can run for days. I have no problem with people using the Scrape blitzes. If they call it all game long great Ill pick them apart. If they mix it in every now and then as part of their scheme Im not going to crucify them for it because its easy to recognize. If I dont recognize it thats my fault not theirs. TLDR Its not unstoppable. Far from it. Is it annoying? It can be. However football is a game of adjustments.

6565398,0,t3_45ivpi,I had a good playoff win yesterday. Guy only came out in cover  drop which I beat on the first drive. He had the same  plays on offense out of gun bunch I believe. I noticed they were the same plays some of the top guys at the madden challenge were using along with hot routes and motions. He scored on me. Then he started using a cover  nano out of the . Held me to a field goal because I didnt see it coming the first time and did slide protect the wrong way the other  downs. He scored again to take the lead with  minute to go in the half and taunted his way in. First play I noticed he set up that nano and the screen worked against it for an  yard TD I returned the taunt right back to him on my way in and it gave me the  lead at half. He scored to go up . I was slowing his defense down but not quite stopping it. Oh he also did that lame pa shot play where even with  man under play pass and shade over the top the receiver still gets over top his man and safety. He sets up in the nano again and I did slide protect the right way and threw bombs all over him since he couldnt play D otherwise. I was up  at this point. He kept doing the PA draw shot and I just usered the safety to take it away so I had a turnover on downs. At this point Im up  with  or  minutes left. Im just slowly moving the ball up the field to kill clock. He comes out in press and cover  drop and brings up one of the deep blue safeties to user. I decide to just score and send a hot route streak right where his user should have been. He didnt play it right and I had an easy TD which forced the rage quit.I felt a little bad because my ovr was  and I would guess his was about an . But I cant stand nanos.

6588565,0,t3_45x08s,the chemistry change is nice. i dont think the stats are too different to warrant an upgrade based on that but now you can have Mariota for whatever offensive chemistry you want which is really nice i still love the  UF card.ill pick up the new one when prices normalize since im running GP.this card is comparable to boss Vick for GP chem styles imo. no doubt Vick is better but well probably be looking at Vick costing mil more than this card...not worth it unless youre Wop or someone else with literally no upgrades to make.uownedatworms what do you think of the card? i know youre runnign GP and just got Vick.,MaddenUltimateTeam,d00t80a,1,t5_2v23y

6588777,0,t3_45xh4t,Finesse and power are equally effective. If anything Ive found finesse to be better from the wide OLBtechnique speed rusher position that youre playing LT and Von in from that  and . I think the difference between the two cards is that LT has higher total moves I mean you said he edges power move but his finesse is higher than this power move and hes the only card with  in both finesse and power.I think thats the unanswered question for me  is it best to have higher total moves or just be really amazing at one of them like Von? No one has tested this AFAIK. For the record I run LT and Von in a  and Ive found that one of they both have games where just ball out and then games where they dont do anything. Hell Ive even had games where TOTY Wilk gets more sacks than them both. It really just depends on who my opponent has on their offensive line. E.g. if they have that SS Greg Robinson card with  pass block then LT is feasting. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,d00u0e3,2,t5_2v23y

Since then Ive played them all but this one is the first one since madden  that Ive consistently continued to play and enjoy. I just enjoy the thrill of trying to put together the best team i can while getting to use unique and awesome cards and different combinations of players.

When he was on his game he could dominate anyone including the late s bulls with Jordan and Magic Johnsons loaded Lakers squad his first NBA finals before the injury even tho he still went ham on one leg.SG  s Michael Jordan.  Impossible not to include Mr. Nike Mr. Gatorade Mr. Tongue Out I cant lose.  Theres a reason the Michael Jordan of is the go to phrase over best in hisher respective sport.SF s Paul Pierce.  I might be only one percent of the world that likes Paul Pierce but Im ok with that.  Hes the TRUTH.  The Big Aristotle knew it and anyone who loves good basketball knew it too watching those great duels between Kobes Lakers and Pauls Celtics.  Great games to watch and I had to include someone from one of those teams to do justice to the best couple of finals in the s NBA era.PF s Tim Duncan.  His prime may have been the s but its almost more fitting to take Duncan as the s selection.  Its a true tribute to his longevity as a player and epitomizes his dominant approach to the game.  Solid every time every game.  Consistent output over time is the result of The Big Fundamental.  You always hear people circle jerk LBJs on the court basketball IQ but Timmy D has one of the most underrated intelligences in the modern game.  He always plays within himself and his skill set.  A great asset as a teammate and a coachable player.  Hes the best to ever do it at PF.Center  s s Bill Russell.  I could take Kareem here from the s and he would be a great fit. Nothing against Kareem.  But theres no other player of any era and any sport I respect more than Bill Russell.  Everyone likes a winner and thats what this man is a pure winner.  He wasnt the most dominant center of his own era with Wilt playing at the same time but he was the best basketball player.  Theres nothing more valuable than someone who plays their best when it matters most and thats exactly what Bill Russell did for over a decade.

If in zone you can adjust whatever player you want to a curl to flat assignment. If whoever you are playing is solely relying on the TE corner to move the ball youll probably have to run cover  to have your CBs likely your best zone coverage players play that route. Might I suggest a cover  blitz to really bait the throw?Did I mention spotlighting the TE? Thats important. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,d0cnjhv,2,t5_2v23y

Obviously all  of those things couldnt have happened lol.If you guys on the committee are buying the gifts yourselves that is still fucking AWESOME and i hope you keep it up. But if you are asking for accepting donations than Im not sure having an I dont give a fuck attitude is the way to go. Its not unreasonable for people to want to know what their donation is actually going to at all. I dont think it applies in this case because uRoyvin made it clear that it was purchased by him but just saying for the future if you guys would like the whole sub to chip in which I think would be really cool!,MaddenUltimateTeam,d0dxpq5,3,t5_2v23y

6749770,0,t3_487g1z,I do run him at  ROLB but I use the Ravens book and he pretty much acts as a  end. As a pure pass rusher hes fantastic. Playing the run hes iffy Sometimes he gets off the line super fast with his high accel and gets to the ball carrier. Sometimes his block shed leaves a bit more to be desired. As a Ravens fan I want that UL Suggs and before that I was contemplating LT but at the price I got Clowney for and the job hes done Ive used the coin to upgrade the rest of my team.  ,MaddenUltimateTeam,d0hhe76,2,t5_2v23y

6987311,0,t3_4bdchv,Here is my takes on the position Heros. . The day of buying the rare card for between k and flipping it once the set is out is basically over. . I think your idea of buying the other elites cheapish and selling them for K profit on each is going to work better. . Personally what I have done is just bought up the expensive card in the set around k. Buy all the other elites around k. Getting enough cards to build the card and sell it. Specifically I had the SS. I also have all the cards for MLB and REor LE whichever end hasnt come out yet. The collectable is the only thing standing in my way Im hoping to get around k. I think if you spend k on a position you will either get the card or sell it around k when the set comes out,MaddenUltimateTeam,d18cpcl,1,t5_2v23y

If they stack the Los audible to the stack out play for an easy completion. Or if they play the receivers youll be running against  in the box.

However even then his price is continuing to plummet so really youre only going to profit on getting Allen right now.

I know how to defend nanos and without an opponent with above average user skill Im usually in a nice spot.  Nanos exist for  basic reasons people love the easy way because no matter what you say when you  use nanos people quit early get frustrated whatever. nd its the internet with the years of playing hh at home wfriends cheese always existed but people would call you out in person most of the time that was that.

When you say its ok to do it against the computer you are enabling and encouraging it. Its called hypocrisy. Youre either for exploiting the AI or you are against it. You cant have your cake and eat it too. There is no difference. If the issue is the ego of the top players or a group of players in a particular tier. That is a personal issue you have with yourself and not with the game. Pro st is full of glitchers and they think theyre good that is the issue.This statement is childish.

7400465,0,t3_4goonv,gt Because of the cap limit some people seem to pick their players around their blitzes This only happened to me for about  games and granted they may not have been good players to begin with but it seems like people pick their players with right accelspeed etc to fit their blitzes. Once I shut that down they were lost.First thing I did each game was go through their lineups to look for things like that.  First game guy had  Vick  Calvin  Von Miller PH Barr and a bunch of scrubs.His entire gameplan was bomb it deep every play and nano blitz.  Easy peasy.Only one team I played was the definition of spread the wealth his best player was  Stafford.  The rest had some sort of focus on nano blitzes or aggressive catch attempts.  Figured that would happen.I went  in my first season.  Im usually better than that but I felt like I need to adjust my lineup.  I went  SR and  RS and I felt as if the boosts didnt really help me too much.,MaddenUltimateTeam,d2jdu1g,1,t5_2v23y

I dont know all the specifics but in some formations when a linebacker is in man coverage on a rb and the rb stays in to block that linebacker will blitz on a delayed rush. So essentially you are adding a th pass rusher and still only have  blockers. When someone runs cover  blitzes on me I will block my TE slant the wr that is by himself put the hb on a wheel and motion the hb to the solo wr side. Ill snap right before he gets set and he will torch his man defender. If they continue to run cover  blitzes they have to user guard the wheel or its an automatic td.

Just to clear that up.  I subbed in  Landon Collins to ss in big nickel last time I ran a million coins lineup.  He got good pressure was awesome against the run and was decent enough in coverage to get a knock down.  But obviously an NTL or lott would be able to be used in a lot of different situations.

So I wouldnt be surprised if a good handful of these top  guys have that style of play as one of their main gotos. But the best ones will have plans b c and d as well. So its certainly going to be fun to see going forward.

However at that point if you snipe one you can just flip that card and save the hassle of building the set. I think the only way to safely make money is to flip pieces for UL sets now. Buy when UL packs are out on weekends and sell during the week. Even then like  weeks ago this was really profitable for me but the last couple weeks have been tough to flip. I imagine now its going to be even harder as there are so many people who left the game and not enough people to flip the cards too.,MaddenUltimateTeam,d4b6940,5,t5_2v23y

Because if you got  of a certain style youre entire team got  boost to certain attributes. When compared to MUT. Only some players get at most a  boost to some stats and thats for a tier  boost.

8683602,0,t3_4yx738,This has been brought up so many times before already and here are your options.  DONT PLAY HH FOR A FEW DAYS?! The game isnt even out yet and even when it is out EVERY SINGLE PERSON will start out in the same division. So youll play EVERYONE regardless of their overall andor skill level. Let the rankings take place then enter HH. Then the only thing you can complain about is how everyone nanos and lob streaks every game and how you should have won.  Spend money on packs or grind solos to get a better team. But do not complain about about the people doing either. Those who play are playing because they enjoy it. So let them enjoy it however they want and you do the same.  Lastly seriously take a step back and realize the game isnt even out yet. Some people have full copies and can put as much time as they want into it. I know multiple people who have already probably logged  hours on this game. I personally have already finished gauntlet and have  legend players  multiple elites. I spent  total and have grinded way more to get where I am.  There is also a glitch thats been mentioned tons that allows your opponent to know whether you are running or passing on whatever play you call that down. So its a good idea to not go into DC HH or SC at all if you can get by grinding solos. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,d6r2qlo,8,t5_2v23y

8955431,0,t3_52y5si,MUT used to be that way. Progress to AllMadden  level then win as much as you can. Not so much anymore. As far as the high end elites we really have not hit that stage yet. The cards available at release are considered the Madden ultimate team set and can be seen by sorting the AH with that filter. Legends TOTW FO etc.. are all promo cards. There will still be tons more promos like BCA Most Fearedhalloween Ultimate Freezexmas etc...It seems like the promos are all changing this year as well but totw and fo work like this collect all the players add them to a set get the set reward card. Same thing with Team Hero cards. Add  gold  silver  bronze and get the monthly hero. It will roll to a new hero every month.For now I think the most fun way of playing is to just play salary cap mode but some people prefer draft champs. I would not worry about obtaining any high end cards right now because they will all lose value rapidly. Just build a sold SCR team and play that mode.Also dont use your LTD players in solos.,MaddenUltimateTeam,d7ob4ks,2,t5_2v23y

9160462,0,t1_d8d58qy,Thats true. I dont like having one of my OLBs being just a dominate pass rusher bc it switches all the time and both my OLBs end up rushing an equal amount and also go in coverage. So If I have an olb that is a great pass rusher but has  speed then anytime the play call has him in coverage its gonna be a disaster. Def cant run man bc of the speed. Any good TE will eat him alive. On the other hand if my OLBs are good cover guys but lack in pass rush then Im screwed. I want to be able to rush from both sides. So thats why I thought maybe doing it the way I talked about could solve that. Are there any ROLBs that compare to Von Miller at LOLB? Obviously hes one that can do both so Ive I could find another OlB like him then my problem is prob solved. I also have a very hard time not having McPhee in my lineup. I dunno if anyone else has had him but seriously hes been so good that I cant take him off. And I dont want him at OLB bc his speed and coverage arent great.,MaddenUltimateTeam,d8d5me8,1,t5_2v23y

He was just saying how its not fair considering a large portion of the player base is young kids that save up or spend their parents money on bundles only to end up with jack shit.

9327896,0,t1_d8yd5j1,Sorry but nope. I have a relatively low Ovr team I just havent gotten to much into MUT this year or grinding.But Ill take a shot. His stats look pretty good especially his receiving stats. He has high speed for a TE and looks to have a decent RAC ability. The blocking stats look serviceable  Run Block is good although  Impact Block is on the lower end of the spectrum. Also something most people dont consider for a TE is pass blocking especially with all the overload blitzes this year. He has  Pass Block which is definitely low but his ability to get open quick could make up for it.,MaddenUltimateTeam,d8ydntl,1,t5_2v23y

So like are you using the right trigger or the left trigger or neither while you spinjuke? Why or why not? Do you know all the controls?Maybe play some games on rookie difficulty so it shows you that little half circle under the ball carrier and try and hit your moves when the defender enters the circle. Play around with the speed moveright trigger and precision moveleft trigger versions. Move up in difficulty once youre more comfortable. You could do the skills trainer to get the basics down but from there you just gotta practice. Watch some YouTube videos and see if you can get the timing down better.

9777979,0,t3_5f89ov,best advice i have is get good at running. most games if my run is on fire they lose because i dont have to bust out all my good pass plays. drag routes and out routes are crazy good but can be covered so you gotta switch it up. deep posts are money as shit usually. be unpredictable. mix in some hb screens bc those are usually always good. throw short then throw deep. run outside then run up the middle when you see them start to defend outside. mix it up and be unpredictable. oh and mess with their head. hit the right stick to act like you are switching the run but instead pass. pass on first downs sometimes dont always run on st. run on rd if youre confident they usually don expect a rd down run.,MaddenUltimateTeam,daicnrj,1,t5_2v23y

This gave me some confidence about getting better without having the cards yet.I checked out youtube and forums about getting better and recognizing cheese and then figure out how to stop it. knowing how players play etc.For now you should be seeing better teams taking stupid chances because of your team.  Play it out when you are down they will throw instead of use the clock etc.  Learn how each one calls and plays their team.  Learn tendencies because they carry over.  Sometimes they mess around and before they know it you have the ball and they are running out of time.,MaddenUltimateTeam,dbk9y5l,2,t5_2v23y

10089292,0,t3_5kb0wd,Randy mossJust have a joke for yaThree nuns die and go to heaven.  They are greeted by St. Peter who informs them that everyone entering heaven must past an intelligence test.  But since they were nuns and had devoted their lives to Jesus the questions would be really easy. St. Pete turns to the first nun and asks Name three of Jesus disciples. Oh thats easy the first nun replies Matthew John and James. The bells ring and the lights flash and the pearly gates open and the first nun enters. St. Pete turns to the second nun and asks Who was Moses? The nun confidently replies Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt into the promised land. And the bells ring and the lights flash and the pearly gates open a second time and the second nun enters. Finally St. Pete addresses the third nun.  What was the first thing Eve said when she saw Adam? The third nun pauses for a long moment and mutters Gosh thats a hard one.

10107734,0,t3_5kmrq5,Believe me when I say that making jump balls more likely for WRs is the last thing you want to happen in MUT. Last year the lob game was ridiculous because aggro catching was OP. There was an arms race for height at every DB position because you could just send every WR on a streak and put the ball up there to get a free  yards. It was absolutely terrible to play HH that way.,MaddenUltimateTeam,dbp1rv3,12,t5_2v23y

10109005,0,t1_dbp77qr,That depends on how much time you spend in the AH and what kind of coinsneeds you have. uashwin would know much more about this but Ill give it a shot. Everyone has that pieinthesky snipe in mind the LTD player on release day. Easy money right? Keep in mind that I said everyone though. Everyone. Unless youre super dilligent with your refreshes and are basically wired directly to EAs server youre probably not making those snipes especially with the supply deficiency of LTD cards. The better things to snipe are plentiful cards that nobody thinks of like Legends collectibles or middling elite players. Set pieces are a good idea because theyre usually in demand but not by everyone at the same time. Snipe cards that are plentiful in the market and already lower than normal prices. This can include Legends cards on weekends flashbacks on thursdays and TOTW cards on mondays. This will let you flip for maximum value and will be more likely to reward you for consistent refreshing. Sniping TH components like rare golds and silvers is always profitable especially in the middle of the month. Someone always needs these but theyre not popular enough to disappear as soon as a snipe comes up. You can also stockpile these instead of reselling them to get ready for the first of each month when they hype is at peak. Snipes arent always  coin steals. Just being able to resell something for  profit can be a significant snipe! Make sure youre always factoring in the resale tax though. Not being aware of that can put a serious damper on your profits. Sniping a k card for k while a snipe is not profit. Youll end up reselling that for k max and tie up k in coins on that card. If that card should crash youre shit out of luck. To build off of that last one diversify! You never know when EA is going to pull some bullshit hello Moss so its never a good idea to have all of your snipes in one promocard. Spread out! Know your prices. The less time you spend crosschecking prices to make sure that yes k for Shaz is a snipe the more time you have to actually snipe the damn card. Know your filters. If your AH is maxed out ie not all available auctions are showing for the filters you have set then youre missing potential snipes! A good way to know if your filters are at a high enough specificity is to remove one. If you see the scroll bar on your AH get smaller it means that more auctions were added to the window so you werent maxed out. The previous filters are ideal for sniping! If youre not looking at one specific card try using the Newest filter. You need to know the prices of each card in your filter set but this will let you see every auction that comes through the block.Ive certainly missed some things. Again some people on this sub are masters at sniping and will often hold QampA sessions like this. Seek them out for more specific help on this topic!,MaddenUltimateTeam,dbp7pzz,1,t5_2v23y

Its crazy that people think physics shouldnt apply bc Its a game.. or because youre throwing into coverage as you said in your post had they read it that people catch in coverage all the fucking time IRL.Fact of the matter is any receiver that drops passes as often as the Madden WRs do would be out of a job before the season was over. Game is so far from realistic.Full control catching mechanics lmfao. Yeah like if I wanna just catch the ball facing my QB then cut up field rather than wrapping the ball up like a baby and leaning to the ground? Or if I want my guy to actually try to contest the ball instead of suddenly wandering off? Or when I just want my dude to put his hands in the air instead of wildly ballerina spinning to try to grab the ball only for some garbage corner to one hand grab it or bat it across the goddamn stadium? Theres no guarantee that youll actually catch a ball regardless of how open someone is or how good their catching is and thats bullshit. This shit happens daily.

Tears up the computer man coverage. Guaranteed  points. However when I had Antonio as my  he would make his cut and it would take him out of the endzone and I wouldnt get the conversion often.

10572176,0,t3_5rdlg5,Browns playbook i form hulk formation. FB flat hotroute the fullback to pass block and hit the tightend on a post for an almost guaranteed td. Or run and use powero and flip the play. Guaranteed yards or a TD. When going for two. Same formation powero. Audible to flip the play completely squarer if on PS. Then flip the run to the weak side. Put your FB in motion to the weak side and run it in for a  point conversion every time. On d punt block man use the returner beside the dline and get in on the qb unblocked for a sack or theyll throw it away every time if its a throwing down.

But the extra hidden stats play a role in gameplay.Look around the MUTHead forums for topics on this. Im sure its been analyzed to death. But just because it doesnt show the stat as going above  doesnt necessarily mean the stats are capped there. ,MaddenUltimateTeam,ddffwq1,5,t5_2v23y

10681466,0,t3_5ssxqg,Ive used both and I like Krause better.Krause is a maniac. This sub tends to hype up a lot of guys that when I try I find lackluster but Krause totally lives up to the hype IMO. I had a game last night where CPU Krause grabbed a ridiculous pick and returned it for a TD and then on the next defensive play I blitzed him and he forced a QB fumble. And yeah thats just one game and kind of an outlier but I feel like hes made a bigger impact on my team than Ha Ha did. I dont know why but Krause is just an animal in this game.That being said usering him feels really strange to me for some reason. Hes got decent enough speed agility acceleration but to me it feels like he lumbers around a bit. So I just let the CPU control him.,MaddenUltimateTeam,ddhpnmq,1,t5_2v23y

11003526,0,t1_def5lv4,Thats exactly what I did. I played madden since  but I never played as badly as I did this year. I just couldnt seem to adjust to the meta and had a hard time knowing what I wanted to run on both sides of the ball.I sold my team and took a  month hiatus but then slowly crawled my way back with draft champions. Now that Im back in Mut I learned during my time in DC that running simple but effective schemes were better than complex ones with different formationsplaysconcepts and a million different hot routes because most of the time I end up confusing myself. I asked myself whats the point of putting all that effort into a broken game when there are plenty of people winning with a lot less skill?. Since I dont constantly think about what I have to do all the time I can focus more on my opponent and stop whatever they are doing. Whenever I lose to some really cheesy shit Im no longer discouraged because I already have enough confidence to shut that shit down the next time i see it.So if it helps just take a break reflect and refresh for a while because madden ball isnt going away anytime soon unfortunately.,MaddenUltimateTeam,def7v2e,1,t5_2v23y

I added Shaq at left who fit the chems nicely despite not having CAR.A hard hitting SS fits in your scheme i used Joseph but you can you any SS with FG to finish Kuechlys FG T.The CBs all have PS so its T and it maxes out Coleman as well.The ends are runstuffers who piggyback on the LP chem from your CAR DTs.On offense the whole line has ZB chem and Yankey another panther! adds Identified which i cant live without. Urlacher at TE finishes Cover Linebacker chem and also is one of the better blocking TEs so he fit nicely.Jeffery Marshall and Steve Smith are all upper end blocking receivers all have CM chem and have high CIT and RR stats.i threw Brees at QB for his  Play Action and he finished CM chem but you can throw in someone else.Also running back is up to you. i prefer Battle Ready chem and Carpenter Poe and Marshall all have BB chem so your RB doesnt have to have BBx to finish the chem.Hope you like it!,MaddenUltimateTeam,deou1kp,1,t5_2v23y

However thats not to say they couldnt expend on their current legends program and add in legends in the late ss. That way we could finally see guys like gale sayers in the game too.

The ball bounces out of the end zone. You get the touchback.. The ball bounces into the end zone and stops. You can now run back pick it up and kneelrun out of bounds. You get the touchback.. The ball bounces out of bounds before hitting the end zone. You get the ball at the  and your opponent is now tilted.. There is a tiny . chance that EA decides to fuck you over and the ball just stops.It somehow neither bounces nor rolls into the end zone. You have to pick up the ball and not get a safety.

Last night I ran inside zone from the gun and ran for  yards and  yards in the first two plays. For some reason this card has little to no trucking ability but he breaks so many tackles and feels so smooth. Not bad for an essentially free card.,MaddenUltimateTeam,dgorq68,5,t5_2v23y
