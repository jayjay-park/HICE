All those moments before their fights there was this kind of feeling that said that This is what weve been waiting for. This is it! Like for Gohans moment Gohan was meditating for like  hours which was basically is like Goku training with King Kai for fighting Vegeta for the first time.

That being said I advise a word of caution before making the leap to watching GT. While it is great to reconnect with some of the same characters I almost wish Id stopped watching at the end of DBZ personally I think GT tarnished their characters a bit.

I think even some of these aspects were considered true even before Einstein that Im not sure about.But time and space are definitely linked and since the fastest any information in the universe can travel is c that is how fast time itself would reveal itself.

It would provide a better leadin to the Z portion of the story introducing all the characters needed especially Piccolo Jr. to keep the story going.

That was at most  minuteTrunks immediately notices that Cell has spotted  and shouts to them. Cell flies forward immediately.  pages with Trunks getting hit by Vegeta and him blasting his father before rushing to Cell only to get hit by the Solar Flare and  was absorbed. It couldnt have taken more than  minutes in total. Of course you can blame Krillin for fucking up but he had to sneak close enough to activate the remote. Also Vegeta had the upper hand all the time so there was no threat. The time from Vegeta allowing Cell to look for  was a few seconds before Krillin smashed the remote.Read it here though the quality is terrible ,dbz,cghqgdw,3,t5_2sdu8

They stated that Akira never seemed to care for DB outside of it being a means for him to get by and survive. Now after others took the franchise and jeopardized it with live action adaptations and even more childish renditions he seems to realize that its his baby. He wants to perfect it in his own manor. The time hes had to rethink certain criteria. You said that the saiyan armor magically disappeared but what you fail to consider is that it is a reboot! ,dbz,cghzcqs,2,t5_2sdu8

1193643,0,t3_27se47,Thats just a bit of filler. Toriyama isnt really known for giving hints about whats to come often just writing from the seat of his pants. For example Artificial Human  was going to be the main adversary of what was to become the Cell arc. The only times in the series that I can think of where the future is hinted at is in Dragon Ball when Uranai Baba tells everyone that one day Goku will save the world came to fruition against Piccolo DaimaoJr. and the other was when Kuririn told Goku not to fight near their friends bodies because they would be damaged when theyre revived at this time God was dead so Kuririn was talking about Namek.,dbz,ci3wje1,11,t5_2sdu8

If we consider the alternate timelines and other universesdimensions as the same thing then it would be weird because we already know of  timelines via the cell saga.

It led me to watch the actual show and now I own all of the seasons have a dragonball z pillow on my bed and a vegeta decal on my car.

SSJ just seems to ruin the power scaling for everything considering that it honestly doesnt seem much stronger than SSJ for one thing. People underestimate just how strong the SSJ form really was because of SSJ. If anything in GT were to be made canon I would want it to be the final series recap outro set to Dan Dan Kokoro Hikareteku but minus all the GT parts. To put it in perspective the ending of GT was one thing I thought was handled better than in Z. Just have an older Goku there like the end of GT but recap all of Dragonball and Z.,dbz,cilqfxu,3,t5_2sdu8

1405844,0,t3_2a8hl8,The thing is... whats a god...?We dont get a whole lot of information about the Kai and the Kaishin  and specifically their origins  in the manga itself but if you want to go with Toriyamas expanded explanations from the  Super Exciting Guide volumes even THEY arent born as gods but rather they are of a race called the Shinjin are selected from within the race to become gods and if they happen to be born from a golden fruit can be selected then as Kaishin.And of course once you get even lower on the hierarchy chain youve got people just being assigned to the role of a god of a planet like our own God of Earth who happened to be Namekian twice in a row.In the Dragon Ball universe and like the Buddhist school of thought that a lot of its references come from being a god isnt some innate thing. Its a job that you can get be assigned to resign from etc. You can simultaneously be a god while also being a regular person and you can be killed. Maybe you get some special powers along the way and maybe you dont.So yeah. If the offer is tossed out there to Goku that perhaps he can take up the role of God of Destruction after Beerus that seems to then imply that maybe Beerus took over the job from someone before him. It doesnt  mean he did but it seems to at least solidify the idea that Beerus took the job. Maybe that job came with extra perks like special training well we know he trained with Whis...! or something else that gets pumped into you.Dragon Ball. Gods. Stuff.,dbz,cisi3p7,31,t5_2sdu8

1431268,0,t3_2aja40,The answer is it depends. In my opinion its a great read and something that every Dragon Ball fan should read but thats because I love Chinese culture and DBZ equally.The full book is over  pages long when translated into English so its a big investment of time and energy. Its also repetitive. So I recommend starting with the abridged version.I dedicate a couple chapters to describing its relationship to Dragon Ball in my upcoming book Dragon Ball Culture. But in short if you want to understand Dragon Ball then reading Journey to the West or at least being familiar with it is essential. The entire framework and story of Dragon Ball is founded upon the BuddhoDaoistConfucian worldview of Chinese culture during the Ming Dynasty. So if you dont understand that then you cant have a full understanding of Dragon Balls origin and why it seems so meaningful to its audience despite Toriyamas deliberate attempts to make it unmeaningful.,dbz,civopmj,6,t5_2sdu8

1452097,0,t1_ciy8pgg,the fourth timeline is similar to the main timeline minus cell. Its the timeline trunks who gets killed by cell goes to and comes back from to stop the androids. Not sure if i can do it in a similar fashion as he did but basically its the unseen timeline the one we know nothing about as we never saw it in that timeline trunks likely got a remote control and used that to shut down the androids then come back to his time the timeline perfect cell originates from and does the same he is ambushed and killed and so cell goes back farther than trunks had gone essentially creating the HoT history of trunks timeline and the main timeline. The difference is that HoT trunks then goes to the main timeline for the same reasons as Trunks from cells timeline went to the unseen timeline to stop the androids. Things only differ when cell shows up so rather than turning off the androids he trains to defeat them. Hope that clears some of it up if you want to see a video on it watch Qaamans video on the  timelines he does a great job explaining it and it should clear up your questions.,dbz,ciyanhx,0,t5_2sdu8

1458633,0,t1_ciytvmb,gt it felt like it went back to the DragonBall formula of adventuring as opposed to fightingThey did try but I think they went the complete wrong direction with it. Especially with turning Goku back into a kid.gt the music is greatI respect your opinion but in my opinion the music was a HUGE turn off for the series. Its probably almost the worst part for me. Im a fan of the Faulconer Score of Z and I prefer the Japanese score for GT a thousand times more than the American.gt it had a better ending for the series than Z.The ending wasnt exactly terrible for GT but I think Z was left open for a reason. The fact that GT tries to end it is what pisses me off. With the new movies coming out I think that the ending of Z is perfect because it could close it if it wanted to  but leaves it open enough for more such as the new movies. I just really dont like GT as a whole. Even when I was younger and watching it I wasnt a fan. Just my opinions.,dbz,ciz459d,2,t5_2sdu8

Another sign was Vegeta acting up in the room after Dabora left he was scolding gohan for not training and prepared a blast to destroy the ship which he then aimed at Supreme kai after he objected and only then did goku intervene and told him yo back off after which he complied so there were a lot of signs even after he Dabora left the room.,dbz,cjefk41,3,t5_2sdu8

1703300,0,t1_cjtj9j2,gtI never said that. Nor did I even suggest it. You are making things up.Really?gtIt has to be stated officially to be official. That right there is your reasoning for why no works can be canon because you feel it has to be officially stated in order to be canon and Akira never officially stated his works to be canon and neither did Toei so your contradicting yourself by first saying it has to be officially stated in order to be true while at the same time saying that youre not saying Akiras works are not canon. gtYou are making things up. Its obvious that yourre not taking this seriously.Claiming such rash things without any evidence is pretty damning evidence of where you truly stand in this debate i get the sudden feeling your trying to carve yourself an escape route without coming across as accepting defeat. If you have proof Im making things up or that im not taking this seriously then present it. I wont lie though you have made me think hard on what canon truly means and debating with you I realize its not the literal definition of the word that matters at the end of the day it just means whatever is considered an addition to a story. You had some good points too and id venture to say you certainly know a good deal but your argument relied on two contradicting statements both of which you refused to accept the contradiction and that was your undoing.gtI said lets pretend.Indeed im well aware of that but the scenario you depicted didnt correlate at all to the topic at least not directly. You need to better explain your examples even if we are pretending.gtAnother example of you making stuff up so that it looks like youre making a good argument.Or maybe the truth of the matter is that I am making a good argument that you are refusing to accept? Its beneficial sometimes to inspect yourself and your current standing in a debate as well as your opponent because if you are blind to your own flaws then the debate will inevitably devolve into a No your wrong and Im right debate. gtI have seen your other posts on other threads and they are usually good and sometimes helpfulThank you for the compliment and I did mention that you do know how to debate and are knowledgeable at it as well Id be lying if i said i didnt at least enjoy having this debate no matter what we both got out of it.gtThis originated as a serious debate and now it is bullshit. I would have to agree but not for the same reasons as you this debate has devolved into just a throwing words around so how about we both just leave it at this since its probably clear neither is willing to accept the others argument.gtIm sorry but come back when you actually want to discuss thisI did actually want to discuss this and I did rethink quite a bit of what I knew prior I personally feel every debate is a good way to benefit even if neither sides agree i still learned a fair bit and I hope you did too Im always here for discussion and if you have anything to add then be my guest and Ill respond accordingly. i certainly dont want any bad feelings between us as we were just debating here and not arguing so sorry if i offended you in anyway. Regardless i had fun and if you feel this is the point where we end it then Im fine with it if not then ill happily answer any other points you bring up. Thanks again!,dbz,cjtv2zc,0,t5_2sdu8

1883048,0,t1_ckg2s7b, They know how to dissipate focus and redirect the damage from their ki blast impacts and we see that quite a bit throughout the franchise. Vegeta charging up his Final Flash intentionally focused and narrowed down the beam to limit the amount of damage it did to Earth otherwise Trunks and Kuririn surmised it was going to engulf and wipe out the planet. Likewise during the Buu Saga using all the ki within his body Vegeta selfdestructed in order to try to take out Fat Buu a ki level easily over a thousand times stronger than Freezas first form and all it did was leave a rather wide crater on the ground. He focused the explosion down to cover as little area as possible and keep from doing significant damage to the planet. If any of those characters youre mentioning just went and directed their blast down at the planet then it would indeed blow the planet up. But we dont ever see that happen until Pure Buu. Their blasts are either dissipated completely deflected away redirected or their explosion on the surface is concentrated enough to leave the planet wholly intact.,dbz,ckg3lmn,1,t5_2sdu8

So if someone does get it they can share it with someone else. But then does that person get the beta too... Or there just playing through the one person who originally got the beta. Where do you even see game share. Is it just for online downloads. I got my ps on release date then sold it in  and just recently bought a ps and PS in the last year and a half.

2039983,0,t3_2i5o2t, Vegeto hit it on the head pretty much but its moreso the first reason rather than the other that explains it. Ever since his defeat during the Saiyajin Saga Vegeta has seen himself in Gokus shadow and as such made it his continuing goal to surpass him. Once Goku decided that he didnt want to be wished back to life Vegetas chances of truly surpassing him died as well since hed never be able to really test himself. The object of his obsession if you will was no more and he was lost without him. Thats why he went to such extremes during Gokus day back in the Buu Saga that he willingly let himself be influenced by Babidi so that his potential could be unlocked because this was his one last chance to fight Goku and find out who was the stronger. Gohan beating Cell surpassing him and even saving him was a significant blow to his pride as well but it was more the fact that hed never have a chance to prove himself to Goku again that hurt him the most.,dbz,ckz4l4o,7,t5_2sdu8

2554544,0,t1_cmrbjr4,I liked the idea of giving him a weak younger brother and that his father was so ashamed of him that he sent him away. Tarble could have died and his family would not have cared.It showed a lot about Vegeta even after becoming a better person. He never talks about his brother because hes ashamed of him. Yes I know Tarble came way after the end of the comic and that it makes sense that hes never mentioned. But even in the special Vegeta still has that look of dissatisfaction and no tolerance for his little bro.So to me it shows more about how Vegeta is still learning to become a better person. The same could be said for Goku too. He never took the opportunity to try and bond with his brother like he has some of his other enemies. Yeah he didnt have much of choice but to kill Raditz and he did give him a chance. It would just be nice of him to try again. ,dbz,cms0l5e,1,t5_2sdu8

2584896,0,t3_2pe3nr,  Tien vs Cell. Just being able to see one of the lesser Z fighters get their moment to shine is so refreshing. Tien has always been a badass and the way he stands up to cell shows his badassary has not subsided. As Tien put it I might just be a pothole in the road to you big guy but its gonna be one heck of a deep pothole!  Goku defeats Ginyu Force Nappa DBZ has some very effective ways of showing how strong a character has become. Mainly by having the others spends episodes fighting someone only for Goku to turn up and defeat them without breaking a sweat. I put these  together because they are basically the same. The others spend ages getting pumelled Goku turns up and beats the aggresor within an inch of thier lives and Vegeta ultimately finishes them off.  Gokus kamehameha against Cell. After a huge power charge where everyone is convinced Goku has gone over the edge and is about the blow up the earth even Cell Goku instantly transmits infront of him and blows him to bits. Did it kill cell? No. Was is ultimately pointless? Maybe. Was it an awesome buld up andexample of how truly great a fighter Goku is? Hell yes.  Piccolos Sacrifice Notice how every sacrifice in the show is to ultimately kill a villain? And the said sacrifice never works? Goku vs Cell Vegeta vs Buu Tien amp chaotzu vs Nappa. Well Piccolo did it to save one person Well so did Goku but with the hopes Cell would die too. The only person who he ever really made a connection with in the show. Sometimes you forget Piccolo himself was once a villain and everyone is always more concerned with Vegetas arc but Piccolo was the first to make the change and its equally as powerful.  Human Extinction Attack. Im not a big fan of the Buu saga but this is without a doubt my favourite moment and one of the most villainous moments on the show. Buus silence Piccolos lament the manic guitar music and seeing adults and children get slaughtered. Here is my favourite version of the scene   Trunk kills Frieza. Remeber I said they made the weaker characters fight villains for ages just so Goku could show up and show how strong he was? Well with trunks they decided to get a villain we had watched pur heroes struggled against for a whole season and kill him in one episode. This was a pretty genius move by the writers to show us just how high the stakes were raised and make us morbidly curious as to what was to come. And also show how badass Trunks is!  Vegetas Death. Im talking about his first death at the hands of Frieza. This was the first time we really got to see Vegetas humanity. After seeing the proud prince get beaten sensessly and effortlessly by Frieza it was painful for us to watch him break down to Goku as to why hes the way he is. I remember hoping so hard that Vegeta didnt die but the last laser in the chest sealed the deal. And gave the audience even more reason to route in Gokus corner.   Friezas defeat on Namek. After weeks of watching the longest one on one fight in animated history I think it all finally comes to an end with one quick slice coming completely out of left field! Cut in half by his own attack I can only imagine the amount of jaws this scene simultaneously manged to drop.   Gohan goes super saiyan . To me this where the gohan arc comes full circle. After seasons of seeing him show small burst of power he finally unleashes his ture potential. Topped off with an awesome permanent death of  and this is a legendary moment. And may I suggest watching the japanese version for some mega awesomeness   Goku goes Super Saiyan the first time. Everything about this moment is epic. Frieza survives the spirit bomb and kills Krillen causing Goku to finally realise the legend and become a super saiyan. Intense emotional mind blowing awesome.,dbz,cmvzf67,21,t5_2sdu8

Besides as the Daizenshuu established Goten and Trunks gained their vast power to being hybrids born without tails. We dont know how that works specifically but we do know thats the reason why.gt So were now lead to believe he has MORE latent ability Gohan was far from his physical prime when he had his potential unlocked during the Freeza arc as he was only around  years old at the time. So his potential had significant room to grow over the next decade to the Buu Saga where he was far closer to his physical prime and thus far closer to having the full extent of his potential built.,dbz,cpfmw9z,8,t5_2sdu8

3411554,0,t1_co03k35,this is late but I was feeling the exact same way Im glad you said this.Did you hear about the original SS God design? gtAccording to interviews with the Battle of Gods character designer Tadayoshi Yamamuro the original concept for Super Saiyan God had the form being more muscular wearing a cape and with a hairstyle inbetween Super Saiyan  and Super Saiyan . The series original author Akira Toriyama came up with a picture of Super Saiyan God that was completely different than Yamamuros own initial muscular cloaked design. They went back and forth like this a bit before settling on the final design and Toriyama was insistent on the form not being too different from Gokus regular appearance specifically not being really muscular.it supposedly wouldve looked similar to thisnot only that but now we wont even get the minimal SSGod it is just absorbed that sucks man. The best part of DBZ is the brand new transformationsIm not even gonna get started on the comedy in the last movie I let it slide but seriously it went on way to long imo with bulmas bday etc.Taking away super saiyan is just awful man ,dbz,cph54ps,1,t5_2sdu8

3424213,0,t3_2zg2zp,Anything after the Z series ends is pretty much considered noncanon mostly because its inconsistent and the fact that Toriyama didnt write it the most he did was draw some designs.Not to mention Toriyama regarding Battle of Gods and by extension Ressurection F as a continuation of the manga and they both seem to be gradually writing GT out of the timeline.Though you should keep in mind theres really no official canon its more or less just up to the fans to decide for themselves.,dbz,cpil33b,-3,t5_2sdu8

It doesnt seem logical to me. Sure it looks cool but the look doesnt make sense with the transformation. I think that maybe if his fur was brown or gold I might like it better but it still doesnt make sense to me that hes an adult as a SSJ but reverts back to being a child after that.

3505387,0,t3_30eqbf,Theres only one way that I know of to buy preZ Dragon Ball uncut and in its entirety. Youll want to pick yourself up the Blue Bricks The quality isnt terrible compared to the Orange Bricks. Dont forget about the moviesFor Z youll definitely want to avoid the Orange Bricks The only good thing about this release is that it finally made Dragon Ball Z easy to buy without collecting endless DVDs. But the picture is botched up beyond being saved and its cropped to widescreen. Ideally youd want to purchase the Dragon Boxes but theyre outofprint and cost a pretty penny. Maybe check eBay if youre interested. Youre probably going to want to go with the latest BluRay releases Theyre still cropped like the Orange Bricks but theyre a superior overall product even if they still arent up to par with what we should be getting. Pick up the movies and Battle of Gods too.GT is pretty simple. Buy the Green Brick Like the preZ Blue Brick the remastering didnt destroy the integrity of the product.

3753185,0,t3_33ctmp,My biggest argument to him being appropriately powered for his timeline is his lack of training with Goku.  And its not just Gokus supervision particularly.  Heck Vegeta would have been an able tutor for Gohan during this period as well had he been an option.  Vegeta was able to unlock the Ascended Levels of Super Saiyan which probably would have been more than capable of taking out the androids in either timeline.As for Goku Gokus ingenuity in the Saiyan transformations helps him not only repioneer the ascended levels that Vegeta and Trunks unlock in the Room of Spirit and Time but also find a level BEYOND that to adapt into for more efficiency IE  FullPowered Super Saiyan.  Complete mastery of the first level of Super Saiyan.  The reason Gohan was able to tap into something beyond IE Super Saiyan  is because there was nothing left to tap into in his current form.  The only characters to attain Super Saiyan  are Gohan in the Cell Saga Goku in the afterlife and Vegeta in either of two points  During the  year gap in trainingI believe this to be true or when Babidi unlocks his evil potential and becomes Majin Vegeta.  Granted theres no SOLID proof that Vegeta ever accomplished mastery of the first Super Saiyan form I immediately assume he does this as any technique Goku has used against him or in front of him he has been able to do himself or at least decipher enough to make his own or find an answer to itSave for  things  Kaiokenseems he never had a use for it with his style of fighting Instant Transmission and Super Saiyan   Id safely assume he trained in the ability to unlock Super Saiyan s full potential though.,dbz,cqk391b,4,t5_2sdu8

This is a warrior releasing his rage the epitome of a ssjSSJAndroid SagaIm not treally too fond of this form besides the hair kinda nearly everything I loved about ssj is gone. To me this one just fell short.I didnt like this for the same reason I didnt like goku either the good characteristics of ssj are gone and as for vegeta I dont like how the hair looks so stiffstationary.I dont know what it is about trunks but he looks pretty cool although he isnt all buffed up with battle damage he still manages to look pretty coolSecondThird Grade SSJLike ssj goku on namek this form is fucking epic wild hair vegeta buffed up you can really feel the power behind itTrunks in second grade ssj actually has a lot of different designsIm not too much of a fan as the first design since he has such short hair and looks like a balloon animalThe second design looks pretty cool but his hair doesnt stand up tall enough imoThe third design though is perfect and much like assj vegeta they both look awesomeUSSJ trunks to me looks awesome I just love how hes SO FUCKING HUGEMSSJ First off is gohan I have to say that gohan looks pretty cool in this form he by no means looks as awesome as ssj but still not badFor goku he actually doesnt look too bad. I like how they made his hair have seperate strands a completely different look of ssj than goku on namek but still cool nonetheless. I actually think vegeta looks much better as a ssj now than when he was in the android saga just a preference i guess.Adult ssj gohan is mehSSJ I have got to say SSJ gohan is one of my favorite designed characters. The fucking look in his face the pure anger the spiked hair the electricity sparking everywhere made this fucking epic.Im not really a fan of ssj goku or vegeta I loved ssj gohan since he was so different from his ssj form but vegeta and goku are barely different. Vegeta in particular. IM TALKING TO YOU VEGETA I CANT TELL THE FUCKING DIFFERENCE IF YOU WERE SSJ OR SSJ.SSJ adult gohan was pretty cool but nowhere as cool as when he was a teenSSj This is cool. That is all. Go back outside nailok just kidding. SSJ goku is pretty cool its not my favorite but I still like it.The hair length varies though. Sometimes its around hiplengthSometimes its knee lengthAnd sometimes its inbetweenI like it in betweenSSJ SSJ is really interesting since its a completely new stylePersonally I think its pretty fucking coolAnd ssj gogeta looks radSSJ GOD Eh Im not really a fan of the design I dont hate it I just dont like itI actually have taken a liken to this super cyan to me its pretty coolWell this post is fucking long as hellHope youve enjoyed reading it,dbz,cr55px3,19,t5_2sdu8

I agree that FnF will definitely be a fun watch regardless of any plot holes and how heavily they may personally affect me but I do think it will inevitably leave me wanting for something a bit more. Like I said earlier I want to be optimistic for Super as well and hope Toriyama tries to take it a bit more serious than this last film like he did with BoG at least which really didnt have any such inconsistencies  and reads over his own manga any notes that he made while writing it the Daizenshuu etc. Even if Super turns out to be awesome in all aspects which I pray it does I still would like to see a reboot of the original series with some nice crisp new animation as I brought up in the original topic.

4027564,0,t3_36n6x9,This is what Toriyama had to say about the Kaiou and Kaioushin in the Super Exciting Guidegt Is Kaisama a hereditary position?gt Inside the big ball I mentioned before there is a planet called the World Core Kaishinsei where the Kai are born and raised. Its a world like a gigantic Planet Kai and Kaisama and his peers are born as Core People Shinjin from the fruit of the World Cores giant World Tree Kaiju. The planets population is about . Core People are neither male nor female and their average lifespan is said to be about  years. At a castle thats like a school they learn a variety of things and live an easygoing life however if a Kai dies on one of the Kai Planets the next Kai is chosen from among them by lottery. However a Kaishin is chosen only from Core People who are born from a special golden fruit which rarely occurs. In addition there are occasionally delinquent Core People with evil hearts these ones fall under the Makai.So Shinjin Core People are born from the fruit of the Kaiju tree and the Kaiou and Kaioushin are Shinjin chosen from a lottery to those positions when the need arises. Shinjin from the normal fruit are only able to be chosen to the Kaiou position and only have a life span of about  years while golden fruit Shinjin can become Kaioushin which have life spans in the millions of years East Kaioushin for example was around for Buus attack on the Kaioushin which happened roughly  million years before the events of Dragon Ball.It is tough to say what Kibito actually is since its never established if hes born from the Kaiju tree or if hes something else but its possible that he is a being born to serve as an attendant to the Kaioushin much in the same way that Popo and Karin were for Earths Kami. According to Daizenshuu  both Popo and Karin were born in the afterlife and then dispatched to Earth to assist Earths Kami with various tasks Popo being there to among other things maintain the Lookout while Karin was meant to serve as an intermediary for Kami and the people of Earth. This is supported by the fact that Toriyamas name pun for him is based on the Japanese word for attendant tsukibito ,dbz,crfderh,12,t5_2sdu8

4098400,0,t1_crnemho,.Westwood Media and AB Groupe later began production on English dubs of the Dragon BallZGT movies and TV specials. However YTV opted not to broadcast them so without Canadian broadcast rules to take into consideration Westwood and AB Groupe decided not to produce these dubs in Canada or license the rights to previous dubs of the movies instead took a notoriously cheap route and had these dubs recorded in an unknown foreign country. These dubs are notorious for having bad voice acting and strange character nomenclature for example Krillin is named Clearin Bulma is named Blooma and any instance of the word Saiyan is replaced with warrior. The scripts were based upon AB Groupes French dubs of the films. These dubs have been nicknamed the Big Green dub because Piccolos name in these dubs was in fact Big Green. The AB Groupe and Westwood Media dubs of these films were broadcast on Cartoon Network UKs Toonami block and were distributed on Television and on video around Europe. The Big Green dub of The Worlds Strongest changed to The Worlds Strongest Guy The Tree of Might changed to Super Battle in the World and Lord Slug changed to Super Saiya Son Goku were released on VHS and DVD but none of the other movies from this dub received a home release due to poor sales of the aforementioned movies.,dbz,crnfyhy,2,t5_2sdu8

4101896,0,t3_37hk1s,is it really supposed to be x base? i always interpreted it as beingBase  X Power Level based off training skill weaponry and standard physiological differences always well short of the persons potential level with training. Kaioken Multiplies Base by Channeling Potential by some amount for each stage which strains the body Super transformations do the same thing but by such a great degree more that it makes sense to discuss it relative to maximum possible output rather than using base as a starting point Super Saiyan itself represents the ability of Saiyans to safely maintain a far larger degree of their potential fighting ability through a sort of natural kaioken for some amount of time. SS  of Current Potential OutputFull Power and Ultimate Super Saiyans represent percentages betweenSS  of Current Potential OutputSS  of Current Potential OutputMystic Unlock  of Current Potential OutputI like this theory because it accounts for why Goku doesnt use Kaioken to boost his power in a Super Saiyan state or even when fighting in his base form after unlocking it. It accounts for why Mystic Unlock restricts and obsoletes the Super Saiyan state for Gohan because according to the Elder Kai thats  output it accounts for why every Saiyan who achieves super except Goten and honestly he may have done that with trunks at some point or vegeta or even Gohan and ChiChi... somehow first went through gravity training that would have toughened their body to be able to channel a greater portion of their own power it also explains one of the differences between the SSJ of dead Goku and living Goku dead Goku doesnt have a real body to strain with the ki load when hes alive his body cant hold onto it and the concentration falls apart because he cant contain it. It also explains why FullPower Super Saiyan works the way it does its about efficiently being able to harness the power and abilities you already have with complete control to maintain the form basically forever to get the most possible output from it. Doing so prepares the body for the next state Super Saiyan  which is one of SSJs problems there doesnt seem to be a full power SSJ to prepare you Goku learned it by cheating as a dead person so he didnt need the preparation so once he learned to call on that level of potential he found that it fizzled more quickly than he thought because his body couldnt handle it. EDIT i would also speculate that God Mode is actually a technique to refine ki that Beerus and later Goku learn to do naturally that sort of compunds it into an enriched form of itself but that changes its properties as well making it unsensible and probably gives a lot more mileage per gallon. If Spuer Saiyan hair glows gold because of the ki output then a change in hair color for SSJGSSJ would indicate a change in the nature of the ki being employed as would the inability to sense god ki. ,dbz,crnuasp,0,t5_2sdu8

Then on his week trip towards Namek he trained hard and was able to push it up to x  times his limit prior to leaving for Namek.

The beans are eaten only by those who train with martial arts god Korin.. Kuririn and the other  train with Korin and then in Z are given a year to train with Kami like Goku did after killing Piccalo.Assuming this is four people training with popo and kami then they likely went through many beans as likely did goku.Korin can only grow like maybe seven or so a month or every certain interval or so. So the jar or jars though I only saw one and dont recall was probably from years of collecting them.The conclusion is probably that the four training with Kami exhausted many of them but Toriyama didnt address why in the manga so this is a best guess.

Other than that I owned both copies of BT and I can say that the GameCube controller plays much better than the PS controller. Other than that you can use Classic or Wii Mote to play. And Wii mote is pretty cool to play with. Its a little bit of a waggle game wit the beam struggles but all attacks are dont with the a button. So you dont have to punch with your arms unless you want to make it feel better. And the beams are done by positioning your arms in the style of the attack and pressing a direction on the dpad. If you want to proform the Kamehameha you have to press left dpad and put your arms to your side. Then if you want to shoot it fast or boost it you have to put your hands out I front of you. Just like your actually doing the real one. As of right now the PS version has more modes than the Wii version if you have BT or . And one of the flagship selling points for WII was online which as of May   has been offline. But I would recommend the Wii version over ps any day. ,dbz,crzur2n,5,t5_2sdu8

4374484,0,t1_csip1l2,gt When did he say this? And Kaioshinn was at least SSJ level. Goku and Vegetas SSJ power was enough energy to move the meter.  Goku Vegeta and Gohan only moved the meter while they were Super Saiyajin  not Super Saiyajin.gt Negative. When Gotenks was a SSJ his transformation wore off THEN he unfused. Regardless the transformation from Gotenks Buu to Piccolo Buu was INSTANT. From Gohan Buu to Piccolo Buu was INSTANT.  Even with Gohan Buu to Piccolo Buu it wasnt instant as we saw him react to Goku and Vegeta removing Gohan and then removing more pods and then he changed. Likewise Goku specifically said that Buu changed because the fusion wore off so you cant say it was a matter of them reverting to normal and then defusing. He was already shown to be keeping them in their Ssj form past the  minute limitation so what caused the change was fusion wearing off. Thats it.gt Ive read it over and over and I have found nothing saying that South Kaio powered him up. Lie much? Goku indicated a power drop. Ive shown you the line again and again but you just want to lie and say he was talking about Buus size.gt yes he did. He said his heart kindness that reduced his power was removed and hes back to his old self. Weve been through this liar. Yeah the heart reduced his power and now he no longer has that heart Thats all Kibitoshin said happened. He never once remotely said that Pure Buu was stronger than before because thats ignoring the clearly indicated power boost he lost when he lost the South Kaioushins influence.gt No Goku understimated him too. He stated he thought things would go better than this He thought things would go better than this because he thought he could overcome Buus regeneration better than he was. Look at everything else Goku says in relation to how hes doing against Pure Buu and you see that all he talks about is Buus stamina.gt Goku Dammit! Like I thought even if I keep doing the same thing that bastards stamina doesnt fall! He just returns to being good as new right awaygt Goku That bastardEven though he can quickly return to normal hes playing around by purposefully drawing it out Nothing about Buus strength at all.gt Except he did say any of that. At all. Ever. And you cant even produce a quote because of how shitty your fan theory is. I already showed you the quotes. You just plugged your fingers into your ears and ignored them. Its clearly established by Rou Kaioushin and Kibitoshin that a successful absorption results in a power increase and a form change. Kibitoshin later establishes that Dai Kaioushin and only Dai Kaioushin affected Buu in a way other than what normally happens which means South Kaioushin didnt affect Buu differently. Goku upon Buu completely reverting to Pure Buu clearly indicates a power decrease from when he was South Kaioushin Buu which also supports that South Kaioushin made him stronger. Kibitoshins line only indicates that the Dai Kaioushin weakened Buu. Thats literally it. It doesnt remotely suggest that Pure Buu is stronger than before simply that he doesnt have the Dai Kaioushins influence weakening him anymore.,dbz,csiqnk0,2,t5_2sdu8

4391291,0,t1_cskmnk0,Yup the absolute furthest thing from it. Goku isnt Superman he doesnt fight for good or the hope of the universe he fights because he loves to fight. He cares about his friends but ultimately hes a selfish character. Thats what makes him so interesting.The best example of the changes FUNi made is probably the end of the Saiyan arc where Kuririn holds his sword above Vegeta. In FUNis original dub Goku says Show him what it means to be merciful along with a bunch of nonsense about how sparing him might change him for the better. That is the furthest thing from the character and not even remotely close to whats said originally. In Kai the scene retains the original dialogue where Goku says to spare him because he wants to fight him again.Gokus a dumb hick he isnt Superman as FUNi felt fit to portray him as in the s. He lives to fight and better himself the last thing hes concerned with is being the hope of the universe. These changes are present throughout the entire dub in almost every character. Its why theres such a divide in the fandom. You have those who enjoy Kai and the Japanese version and those who worship FUNis original efforts. Theyre never going to agree with one another because theyre two very different shows. One is extremely westernised and the other is Dragon Ball as was defined by Toriyama.,dbz,cskmuha,6,t5_2sdu8

4463053,0,t1_cst5etn,p does not inherently mean widescreen. It simply means  vertical lines of resolution.For example FUNimations Dragon Ball Z Level sets were true p video streams but were still in their proper  aspect ratio.Due to dumb Bluray technical specifications p HD streams REQUIRE the video to be encoded as x so  pixels of black on each leftright side were added  on left   of video   on right   total horizontal pixels. This is actually crazy backwards compared to DVDs where an anamorphic video stream could be encoded making it possible for both  and  video streams to be encoded as x pixels just defining square vs. rectangular pixels.Long story short no there is no HD scan of Dragon Ball GT. As far as were aware FUNimations master are digibeta tapes which is standard resolution ip at best. To scan a true HD master would require film prints. This is absolutely something Toei has in their vault but Toei has not done an HD  Bluray release of the series at all beyond their scan for Kai.,dbz,cst8vur,13,t5_2sdu8

The last time we had a full setting at the sea was during the Blue portion of the Red Ribbon Saga if I recall. And Cell pursuing the Androids if that counts.It seems Dragon Ball Super will cover the most important events from Battle of Gods for those who might not have seen it and it also refreshes the entire thing for those of us that have while giving us extended details on events. Its just genius.Now this is just personal observation but it looks like each of the episodes up until this point focus on an individual family at least to an extent. Episode  is Goku and his extended family Episode  will cover Vegeta and  will now be Kuririn. I hope Im right about this.,dbz,csyfebe,2,t5_2sdu8

Granted this doesnt make sense with Gohan as he was born with a tail but this could be written to be the rare exception.

Since all darkness of the original Namekians soul was contained within this splitoff copy that might be what gives him the demon attribute  that he is pure evil by origin not by his actions and by consequence all the mutant offspring he has is also demonic. Evil actions do not make you a demon but evil origins make you one. Good actions can then remove the demon attribute. I think thats the most consistent mechanic behind it but I can see why you wouldnt like it. That means demons are manifestations of pure evil which makes sense given their japanese name wherever they live and whatever their origins or biology are. Its just that there exists a demon world which is inhabited only by such beings but in other parts of the universe like on Earth evil may also manifest itself in some way into a physical body Piccolo. Sayans do not really qualify I suppose because they still had some good in them Bardock even if they did mostly evil deeds as a whole. They were not born as manifestations of pure evil. Edit Well no never mind. Only one form of Boo was pure evil and yet all of them were demons... mulls onEdit But he was originally born of evil... and he never did enough good deeds. Apparently absorbing good people does not redeem you from demon status even if it changes your personality.,dbz,ctlx1qz,1,t5_2sdu8

4760960,0,t3_3g3iib,I started watching Dragon Ball after Z was broadcast but I have so much more fond memories of watching Dragon Ball than Dragon Ball Z. Its up to anyone on what they want to watch. But its now the year  and you have the power to decide the order of what you wish to watch. Many of us would have preferred seeing Gokus early adventures and his fight with Piccolo before seeing Raditz but didnt quite have the fortune of doing so. Do not make that mistake willingly. Something else to consider and it even goes without saying. Z makes up the second portion of the Dragon Ball book. That means youll be missing out on key details with only flashbacks to fill you in.Lastly youll have much more enjoyability and understanding of characters if you know the struggles theyve had in their early years.For anybody that complains about dated animation just remember that Dragon Ball was produced less than  years before Dragon Ball Z. Dated animation is cringeworthy is something entirely in your head.Enjoy Dr. Slump manga OP. Its amazing.

He cant do this directly as he has to obey Beerus however if he never learns IT or even worse IM then Beerus will always be limited by how fast Whis can go from one planet to the next.So a single temper tantrum from Beerus wont result in a whole galaxy being wiped from reality. ,dbz,cu5xc0r,4,t5_2sdu8

Roshi seems like at this point he wouldnt want to be wished back if he was killed individuallyi.e. where hes have to be wished back specifically and not as part of a whole group. While he has shown reluctance to die at times I think him dying and moving on would fit in with his whole idea of passing things on to the next generation now which is why he retired from fightingup until RoF at least. Its kind of upsetting how Roshi is delegated to comedy relief considering how important he was early on. His lessons and style shaped Gokus whole world view and training style in a lot of ways. While his other teachers gave him more significant power boosts on the surface its Roshis that really made Goku what he is. ,dbz,cujp80f,5,t5_2sdu8

The only reason Goku was ever able to beat him was because he never had to put effort into a thing he did so he never got used to his full power and it just bled out of him.Which incidentally is exactly why he lost to the two of them on Earth as well. He never understood the value of real deep rooted training. He just wanted instant easy power.

People are saying it is slow paced only because it is an extended version of the film but in reality it a far faster than DBZ pacing wise. After we get through the Resurrection F arc which I assume is the next arc I think people will complain far less about the pacing because it will be all new material from there on out. ,dbz,cuunn5e,1,t5_2sdu8

Having Super Buu come out of a different place than the lookout would be cool. But him absorbing all those other creatures across the galaxy and Gohan still beating him I dont know. I honestly would change more and change earlier. I would have Gohan kept up with his training more. I really hated the sit on the ground for  days and omg power up with the elder Kai.

Fans have also decided to use the term in fan comics such as Multiverse. Freeza Race is also used in Xenoverse too.In fact there is no official term for Freezas race as Toriyama has never named them.There has not been any given explanation to why Freeza appears the way he does in the movie. We can presume it was from his training that he did after being revived. In the four months that he had The movie explains why he is gold but in the interview with Rysei Nakao it also explains why he is goldgt Rysei Nakao Interviewgt The glittering Golden Freeza was surprising!r  gtgtAccording to Freeza he apparently went with gold so it would be easy to grasp but hes obtained an overwhelming speed and power. The developments in the battle scenes were truly so quick that our voices could barely keep up with the transitions between attacking and defending and even Masako Nozawasan and I who have been doing this for many years were going Huh? Was that my attack just now? The recording was really tough.It has also been referred to as an evolution of some sort as well. gt Rysei Nakao Interview  gt In the film you evolve into Golden Freeza. What were your first impressions?rgtgt Personally I associate Freeza with white and purple. So when I first heard golden I couldnt even imagine what that would be like. Then I saw the images and it literally was just him turned golden laughs. Dragon Ball has Super Saiyans so golden is nothing rare. Maybe because of that in the film Freeza himself says that he gave golden a try as if hes looking for feedback. Even the name Golden Freeza is something Freeza coined himself laughs.

5235488,0,t3_3mpdsg,Old school fansub guy here. Im . I started watching Dragonball Z on VHS in  before it came to the US. It was very early on in internet history so I would google for fansubbersdistributors except Google didnt exist yet so it was most like askjeeves or yahoo back then.... Then after finding someone who had some episodes I hadnt seen Id mail off a postal money order and in  weeks Id get a package of super extended play Dragonball Z or whatever else Id ordered.  I never found the Android Saga and my copies of the Cell Saga were VHS copies of copies of copies and the quality had gone down so much that any time any ki blasts happened the screen would blast allwhite and you couldnt see any of the pictures let alone read the subtitles.And thats what I enjoyed for years. Sometime later I got the series in Japanese without subtitles so I could enjoy the pictures at least and some of the story with my limited Japanese knowledge. And then of course I bought the DVDs once they were finally released.,dbz,cvh2eo0,1,t5_2sdu8
5236531,0,t3_3mqfp7,Well the problem is that they already have two forms much stronger and have him get said forms so it would just be a waste of time to get it. Also Im not sure that Vegeta could learn it since Goku learned it when he was did which means he had no bodily limits and he also hints that in the after life there is no concept of time so it could have taken him  years to learn the form. As for Gotenks all fusions have been shown to be extremely magical and bring out the best of the combined fighters so I think they were only able to get SSj  by the fusions magic making it easier to obtain. ,dbz,cvh6x9d,6,t5_2sdu8

5378897,0,t1_cvz4x10,So basically the content you dislike is somehow inherently worse than the content you dont like? I agree with you that there is valid interest in the finer points of details in costumes and such but apparently there is also another group within the culture that likes sexy version of characters. Maybe there is even a group within that group that only likes cosplay for the sexy people in quirky outfits and the details of the character dont matter as much. To some of those people maybe the way you enjoy cosplay is weird. Maybe they think youre focusing too much on the character and too little on their real life person. But neither of you is right. There is no inherently correct position on this issue. I dont think you are upset at the actual people fressing as sexy character name I think you are upset because there is a subgroup within a culture that you identity with that you feel is damaging or offputting is becoming more and more prevalent and the subgroup you are in is apparently becoming smaller and less relevant. And that makes sense it can feel bad to begin to feel alienated from a group you identify with even if only partially. But just because you dislike some of the content that is getting a bunch of attention you cant go around calling all the people involved sluts and discredit their content. You need to instead accept that there is another group that enjoys cosplay in a different way than you do. Its like being upset when someone enjoys a food in a different way than you do even if you feel like they dont get it such as someone putting ketchup on an expensive steak or coke in fine aged whiskey. Just because they have ruined their steakdrinkcosplay culture experience etc doesnt mean you cant have your own version. ,dbz,cvz7qf9,-2,t5_2sdu8

As Vegeta returns home to Capsule Corporation hes surprised to run into Bulma and Whis who have just returned from the restaurant. Vegeta asks Whis where Beerus is and when Whis replies that hes still sleeping back at his planet Vegeta demands that Whis take him to Beerus so that he can show Beerus the true power of the Saiyans. Bulma angrily pulls Vegeta aside and explains her plan to bribe Whis with food which she thinks is the only surefire way to keep safe. After all even Goku couldnt beat Beerus so Vegeta definitely wont ever stand a chance. Vegeta is not happy about any of this and wants to force Whis to take him to Beerusbut he quickly changes his tune when he senses an unknown power from Whis. When Vegeta demands to know who or what he is Whis explains that he is Beerus martial arts master.gtIn order to get Whis to train him Vegeta promises to feed Whis the tastiest thing on Earth. He first takes Whis to a tempura restaurant but it turns out to be the exact same one he and Bulma just ate at. In fact Whis and Bulma have already been to every restaurant Vegeta can think of leaving him no choice but to cook something of his own for Whis. But Vegetas attempt at cooking is a complete disaster he cant even crack eggs open so that the yolk goes into the bowl and one of his eggs hatches into a chick as a final insult. Bulma and Vegeta insult each others cooking for a bit before Vegeta asks Whis to list all the things Bulma has had him eat and realizes that somethings missing. Bulma has been hiding the tastiest food of all from Whisinstant ramen! When Whis tries some hes at a loss for words and soon takes Vegeta whos got some new armor courtesy of Bulma through space all the way to Beerus planet.,dbz,cwbqni5,29,t5_2sdu8

Then they finally fight frieza then as it turns out hes in the weakest of his  forms and by the time its goku vs final form frieza the epic meter has been hyped up to  then goku goes super sayian and at this point your trying to keep yourself from throwing up crying and shitting your pants from the excitement and epicness and all the other dbz sagas were like that.

The way fights played out in the original anime kind of doesnt line up exactly with the faster tone of the manga where some things just sort of happen and theres not alot of power comparisons being factored in.For me I think of energy the way Id think of MP Gauges.  Some characters have a small gauge some have a large gauge.  This allows them to spend their meter to raise their power speed and defense.  Weaker characters can only fight using nonphysical abilities in limited amounts.  To me a Super Saiyan is like a character with a large MP gauge and MP regeneration.  A Super Saiyan isnt stronger than a non Super Saiyan he can just use energy consumption powerups and abilities constantly without getting tired.  Applying this to events from the Androids Saga Gokus heart disease gave him a constant mp hp and stamina drain.  His ssj powers ran out quickly because he emptied out his power and it wasnt able to refill itself.  Androids  and  had a nuclear core that meant they had infinite mp and stamina.  They werent super strong like Cell but they could keep going without getting tired or running out of power.  Also lets say that Mecha Freeza was technically high specs in terms of power but he wasnt used to his cybernetic body and wasnt able to fight even on the level of his  form from freeza saga which was able to go toe to toe with a Super Saiyan until he ran out of energy and reverted back to his regular th form back then.The thing about DBZ is that none of it makes sense unless you kind of stop thinking of power levels the way we used to.  You have to think about it in a more creative way which is probably how toriyama sees it now looking back.  And if you think about it we never got to see old story arc characters go up against new ones.  Character strengths were actually kind of relative and theres nothing that says that zarbon and dodoria are ACTUALLY weaklings when you start to split ki off into its own thing and look at character strength in a more technical manner,dbz,cx9n7er,2,t5_2sdu8

It was only until watching the DVDs that I began appreciating the time spent in restoring these classics.To answer the question though yeah I think it would have been better if they spent their budget on making a limited number of episodes with completely new footage rather than work old footage around. Only Toei Animation will show us  footage in the year . When compared to recent entries such as Battle of Gods the characters do look peculiar.In the end it wasnt such a bad thing though.

The reason they gave us in how everyday  he got into the regeneration chamber  still wouldnt make that large of an improvement to go toe to toe against piccolo because like you said piccolo has put so many years of hard work to get this powerful.  Maaaybe if we get a decent flashback on how the training with frieza went both in how Tagoma got this strong and how frieza got as strong with only training against tagoma i will buy it more. I doubt we will because it would take a half to a full episode i think to reallt flesh out his character.

Bald dude just got beat up by Freeza whos never trained a day in his life so somehow I doubt its effective training for  months.

6030789,0,t3_3y18zk,I feel theres some consistency to power levels. On Earth Vegeta full power was  and KKx Goku was just above  and couldnt keep up with him x .. KKx was over  and completely dominated Vegeta. x.. On namek Vegeta after zenkai was  and Dodoria was . x . Vegeta completely overwhelmed and was able to vaporize him so we can say a minimum of  advantage is required to do this. Gokus KKx Kamehameha on Earth didnt do this to Vegeta though my explanation is that Vegeta didnt receive the full damage of the attack because he managed to get off the blast before it detonated however he was seriously injured.When Vegeta fought Zarbon he initially had the advantage until Zarbon tranformed after which Vegeta was being manhandled. Vegeta put up a good fight though and Ive seen many explanation videos rate Zarbon at  so x.. Goku did better against vegeta at KKx on Earth than Vegeta against Zarbon so this lines up. The last example Ill give is Vegeta vs Recoome. The Ginyus read Vegeta at . Vegeta shocks Recoome and unleashes a barrage of hits and throws him into a boulder and unleashes an unnamed attackFinal Flash on him. All this does is leave Recoome with his tattered under garment otherwise unscathed. Many place Recoome around  but Ill use . x.. If Recoomes Eraser Gun hit Vegeta he wouldve been dead as fathomed by Gohan and Krillin.So I feel Power levels have their place in the Saiyan and Namek arcs they tell the story of why the battle played out the way it did. Its also a neat way to gauge how much more powerful one character is in relation to another.,dbz,cya5knb,3,t5_2sdu8

The battle between Goku and Beerus near the end could have been a bit longer but Supers version was far too long. I liked a few new additions to the RoF arc in Super such as Goku and Vegeta training with Whis Ginyu coming back and Tagoma being upgraded from Freezas target practice to a somewhat competent foe.

Ill need to use Kaioken and go to  to win! Oh wait! I can just naturally go to  and do the same thing theres no need to use a double edged technique for that! Its useless!I bet next youll tell me Goku can use his Super Saiyan  power in his Base Form.gt Even in the full nelson he was about to beat the brakes off Ginyu until Ginyu let go of him on his own.So were just going to ignore Goku considering using Kaioken to break outAgain why would he need Kaioken if he could just naturally do everything Kaioken is capable of doing.gt Except Goku and Vegeta clearly are. Since Goku took a beating from  Oozaru Vegeta when his max was . And Vegeta took a beating from Kid Boo twice. Obviously neither assaulters werent going  but this makes the case of their defense even though they were severely outclassed.Uh good for them? They have enough ki to not die. Hell Gohan got his neck broken by Recoome. Freeza was cut in pieces took a full power attack from SSJ Goku and took the planet exploding something he would rather not experience even at his full power and still lived to tell the tale. Krillin took a kick from Cell and didnt die and the gap was leagues higher than any previous example.Again Goku and Vegeta arent magically special.gt King Kai states Goku was indeed using Kaioken the entire fight against  Frieza.First off its Kaioken x you were thinking of not x.Secondly Goku was not using Kaioken x at the moment I linked while Freeza was still using  of his power.Finally even if he was thats still a  million difference between Freeza and Goku and my statement wouldnt change. Freeza would have tore a hole in Goku by sheer accident.gt Once again there is no evidence suggesting Frieza with a power level of . Million couldnt take on  fighters with  million ki each. Lesser beings have successfully done so with far less power and talent against opponents MUCH closer in ki.And once again if what you said is true than every battle with a minute difference in battle power would be an absolute stomp to the point of just oneshotting them.gt As a matter of fact Goku with a power level of roughly  million took on  Mecha Frieza and his even more powerful father King Cold gt and killed them both in Trunks timeline.Youre missing  zeros there With so many factors of that unseen battle for all you know Goku took them by surprise Goku would have Teleportation at this point.

It will not contain the replacement soundtrack you were recommended.However it sounds like you are receiving advice from a friend who likely grew up with the series and wants to share that version with you. The original dub with replacement score is very iconic the cheesy dialogue and signature sound of the soundtrack are referenced a million times over especially in projects like DBZ Abridged. Your friend probably recommended this version so you dont miss out on the version most people fell in love with in the beginning.

In DC when Batman becomes one with the mobius chair he is a completely different person. This is how I would think would happen if Goku and Vegeta becoming gods but this has yet to happen.

6361194,0,t3_42qb74,Its just as others say. Shes only a little upset because of the work they put in to gather them. It was just her gut reaction to him making decisions on a whim. And she got over it quickly and didnt protest any after.Its likely just an attempt to convey a slightly different personality and dynamic between her and Champa then we see from Whis and Beerus. Both Whis and Vados have a sort of caretakerparentteacher portrayal. Whis seems more carefree. A lol kids will be kids. type while Vados is probably more of a type to respond to immaturity with scolding and finger waving. Keep in mind that Champa is likely her student just like Beerus is to Whis. Vados will probably show that relationship more since shes a girl in a anime that more male populated. They dont have a lot of opportunities to show common comical anime tropes and dynamics and this is a good place to show one. Champa as a lazy idiot male and Vados to be the female that always reminds him of that for comical effect. Just look at how bluntly she calls him fat or jumps at a chance to lower his ego by saying hes weaker then Beerus because hes fat.,dbz,czcp3q6,2,t5_2sdu8
6366629,0,t1_czd8phq,I mean auto restore a body back to whole as part of a single wish to bring someone back to life.I see no reason why Frieza is any different than Krillin other then plot. Krillin was blown to pieces by Frieza but Purunga was able to bring him back body and all with a single wish. Shenron . however couldnt do the same with Frieza.Now that I think about it Tein got his hand back and Chaotsu got his body back he blew himself to pieces too from Purunga resurrections.You could maybe say Krillins body was reconstructed as part of moving his death point from Namek to Earth. But that would unofficial fan canon reasoning. And of course that doesnt explain TeinChatsu....Reading over your text a second time you might be trying to indicate that Frieza was still alive after getting cut to pieces and before Trunks blasted those pieces. Possibly that he could stay alive in pieces like he did after being revived. I personally dont buy into that. To me the only reason he was alive while being in pieces was as part of the wish. Could call it residual magic keeping the wish granted.Over all its just nit picking. I like my theory better. But at the end of the day its just Toriyama asspullingretconning to suit his current plot. If Frieza was revived normal theres no good way to justify the Z warriors not accurately sensing him and intervening nor could you justify Frieza being willing to leave the planet right away to go train escape before the Z warriors got there or leave without blowing up earth first. Purely a plot device.,dbz,czdbdhc,2,t5_2sdu8

Its a facet of writing not of the character.Even given that though you still ignore the majority of the topic which is who are you picking fights with that leaves you with a lossless record? It doesnt matter if Saitamas never lost because all that really means is he hasnt fought anyone equal or above him and it doesnt mean its impossible for him to lose.,dbz,czec49h,2,t5_2sdu8
6384318,0,t1_czfa3dw,Ok then.Dragonball at least the early portion would change quite a bit. Pilaf would take over the world simply because no one would be able to stop him. Goku and the main cast might die from being left there in his palace. He would rule until Piccolo awoke and took over the world because no one would be able to stop him. Piccolo would rule until Raditz came took over the world and eventually sold it. Vegeta and Nappa would have no reason to come and Freeza would rule the galaxy.Cheating a bit now and assuming they somehow got out Yamcha and Goku teamed up and managed to break free and stop Pilaf or something. The series would be exactly the same with exception of the Jackie Chun fight. Roshi wouldve kept Goku in the Bankoku Bikkuri Sh for a while longer until Goku passed out and wouldve taken the tournament either way. Maybe even stop the technique and give a knock out blow to avoid killing him. Now on Dragon Ball Z the Saiyan arc would be the same until Goku fights Vegeta. Vegeta wouldnt go Oozaru so he would just beat Goku down until Gohan and Kuririn came back. The split comes from after he uses that explosive blast to knock everyone out. If you assume he kills them the series would proceed with him going to Namek progressing as usual until the Ginyu Force kills him. Freeza rules the galaxy again and the series is over. If he for some reason most likely too low on power couldnt kill them the series would proceed normally until the fight with Freeza. Since he cant transform now Vegeta is able to stalemate him. This leads to two possible outcomes either Vegeta with Gohan and Kuririn overpower Freeza or Vegeta stalls until Piccolo arrives and kills Freeza. Goku has no reason to even get involved but even he did he wouldnt even need the Kaioken to destroy him.Movin to the Android arc. Assuming Cold would still come to earth he would kill everyone. Series over. Assuming he doesnt Androids  wouldnt be relevant. Gero doesnt have enough data to account for the ridiculous power ups everyone got in Namek. He would only be based on the Saiyan arc. And since everyone is literally hundreds of times stronger they would trash the Androids. Trunks has no reason to comeback at all. Only thing that could cause issues is Cell but Piccolo fused with Kami can completely crush him. If he managed to escape and absorb enough people to overpower Piccolo RoSaT training is brought in and Cell is completely curbstomped by Piccolo. DBs are lost forever due to Kami fusing and they cant bring back anyone Cell killed.Buu arc cannot happen because there is not enough power on Earth to actually be able to awaken Buu.,dbz,czfbu9i,15,t5_2sdu8

6397131,0,t1_czfxac6,They might be. Last February or smth like that a couple of popular DBZ Youtubers met the guy that works for Bandai Namco basically telling the Japanese higherups what American fans want and gauging interest on things on this side to see which of their anime games are worth porting over.Long story short they were told to make videos asking if people had interest so they could email it to the guy and see if they were willing to at least do a digitally released hdremaster they did that and sent the guy the proof and as of some time during the second half of last year they were still waiting on the guy to get back from Japan and give them information. All in all it seems like theres a  shot of it happening but there wont be any new modes or characters or anything if it does.

6521381,0,t3_44yish,Im against a lot of fanservice demands.When Super started up so many people were excited about Vegeta turning SSJ to defend Bulma. Im so happy that didnt happen.And Gohans character makes complete sense to me and I think he is being handled very well. I think a lot of people are missing the point like a lot of Gohan fans do with Saiyaman is that thatsthejoke.jpg. The series is foreshadowing hell get his moment eventually.And Im not a fan of recent awkward shots of Bulma. From the underboob to the broken spine to the broken spine and achy tits Im all for sexy Bulma fanservice but prefer it when she is anatomically correct and has agency. Bulma will willingly put herself in sexy service positions so it annoys me to see her contorted into them against her will.Finally my favorite obligatory unpopular opinion I love the BioBroly movie. So could we stop recommending newcomers skip this one? Its so much fun.,dbz,cztv1q8,25,t5_2sdu8
6521584,0,t1_czrye3o,Its one of the first I have noticed. We are still roughly within  years before the end of Z which still fits for Bulmas statement. Even so I think she talks about the least time they all got together or at least it could be reasonably be interpreted that way so in Super it likely just referring to Bulmas birthday party. The power scaling does not really effect the end of Z because Goku was not going all out anyways. If anything Goku being able to casually spar with the reincarnation of Majin Buu in base form makes more sense.There is the issue with Bra but honestly she does not have to be born yet...but they are cutting it really close. Bulma probably should have been pregnant already but that is a small detail for a show like this and is not out of the ordinary that would not focus on that.The reason Gokus comment in this episode does not quite add up is because he brings it up in the end of Z like it is new information. Vegeta specifically is surprised by it when he brings it up at the tournament. Im rationalizing it by this is still five years out so they forget about it in the sense they were not actively thinking about it.,dbz,cztvsxt,1,t5_2sdu8

6716107,0,t1_d0dzrrm,The problem with Goku not using SSJ even if theres a reason for it is that is undermines the message of the original fight. That being that after Vegeta goes Majin him and Goku are complete equals in power for the first time in a long while. Its probably part of the reason why Vegeta decides to sacrifice himself. He actually had some closure to his desire to finally surpass him. SSJ ruins that entire idea.,dbz,d0e0510,9,t5_2sdu8
6724718,0,t3_47oe5x,The whole arc makes no sense. Given the understanding of the characters theres no way Future Goku wouldnt have made his way back to Earth and killed   and Cell.Goku dies of heart issues keeps his body in otherworld so he decides to train with King Kai the Androids show up and kill everyone they keep their bodies and train with Goku King Kai gets the Nameks dragon to wish them back to life. They return to Earth stronger than the Androids and Cell. Akira really tried hard in making everyone believe Goku would just say oh well we lost sucks for us. and leave it at that while Earth goes to Hell for over a decade. Its completely out of character. ,dbz,d0ew7dd,1,t5_2sdu8
6726662,0,t1_d0ew7dd,the dragonballs would have disappeared when piccolo died.  without gokus instant trasmission there is no way to travel to or even locate new namek in order to use their set.  We see this in Fukkatsu no F new namek is apparently impossible or very difficult to find using technology like radar.  Also in the original timeline the android attack would have been a complete surprise.  It probably went like thisGoku dies of heart disease.  Earths dragon balls cannot revive him and the namekian dragon balls are unobtainable.  Knowing Gokus personality he would probably rather just stay dead anyway.  Also without his sacrifice against Cell he wouldnt be granted his one day on earth like he was in the main timeline buu saga.Androids attack everybody dies almost instantly with almost no clue as to what is going on or why these human teenagers dont have ki signatures and are stronger than super saiyans.  Vegeta being evil is probably reincarnated immediately or sent to some kind of personal hell.  Earths dragon balls are gone.  Goku and Piccolo the only fighters with a chance of resisting the androids are hanging out in heaven with no way of interacting with the earth.  You could argue King Kai could let them communicate with Gohan but how helpful would this really be?  Also at what point would the kaioshin step in and say stop meddling in the affairs of the living?  So now Gohan and Bulma are the only people on earth in any way resisting the androids.  Gohan is unable to reach new levels without his fathers guidance and his power stalls so he starts training Trunks.  Bulma probably tries to find new namek eventually gives up and starts work on the time machine....  ,dbz,d0f3g7q,2,t5_2sdu8

Possibly one of the Gods of Destruction their trainers or even the Supreme Kais. Much like how Whis prevented Vegeta from attacking.

6902118,0,t3_4aa3eu,Honestly I thought that Dragonball Super was going take one of two paths. . A path similar to Naruto in which Goku and Vegeta are godsliterally and metaporically compared to the other characters in the series just like Naruto and Sasuke are in their series. The other characters are there for support but basically dont mean shit in serious fights against villains.. They are going to give the other characters serious powerups during the timeskips and they would be able to contend with the super powerful people that universe  apparently has.Based on what we have so far its looking as if number  is going to happen. Piccolo didnt even get a powerup for the tournament against the strongest fighters in the universe. Frost was weak as shit and even though he cheated Piccolos only saving grace was the Makankosappo and even that was barely enough to give him the edge. I doubt he would be able to defeat any of the other fighters in the tournament. Gohan is in the same boat. Unless he becomes a Super Sayian God he will be irrelevant. ,dbz,d0yo9k7,3,t5_2sdu8

What Freeza used on Namek was simply a powerful blast that would have destroyed the planet outright but he held back too much power to destroy it all in one go. There was still enough power behind it though that it destabilized the core when he hit the planet causing its eventual destruction.gt the Dragon ball universe only has four galaxies No it doesnt. All the original dialogue within the manga indicated was there were four sections or quadrants of the universe and with both visual information as well as dialogue mentioned in Dragon Ball Super we know for a fact that there are far far more than just four galaxies making up U.,dbz,d0zqtae,4,t5_2sdu8

7017515,0,t1_d1bdksp,Um its pretty obvious what limit removal means in saitamas case. What else would it possible mean? Just because it was stated by a character in the series doesnt make it any less of a plot point. If thats the case whos to say elder Kai is even right about goku and beerus collisions being a danger to the universe. Its not like hes ever seen the universe get destroyed. Plus Its not like other powerful characters really have the same premise that Saitama has. Or the big ass gap between the scale of his casual feats. I mean he got his power from a normal workout for gods sake. I dont see anyone questioning or applying logic to arales obviously nonsensical OPness lol. And I mean going to your comment about going from planet buster to universe buster I really dont see why thats so inconceivable. His last feat against sea King before fighting boros wasnt even remotely planet level but he still threw a planet level punch in an instant because he just so happened to be fighting someone Atleast planet level and he obviously wasnt strained. By your logic goku cant possibly be universe level because he punched krillin in the face and he didnt explode along with at least the solar system. If someone whos universal level can hold back enough to punch his friend in the face without imminent death without having his power capped off why cant that be possible for Saitama as well? Let alone characters in DBZ go all out all the time with relatively little environmental change so theres so much nuance that its not even a valid calculation ,dbz,d1bs7yb,1,t5_2sdu8

7137018,0,t1_d1owewb,gt My prediction Vegeta loses against Hit Goku figures out how Hits technique works but forfeits anyway as he wants to see Monaka fight and believes he can beat him. Goku gives Hit a sensu bean and Monaka loses Hit wins Champas cube and goes off to seek destruction FTFY I think that would go more with Gokus idea of a fair fight and his personality. However I still dont think Goku would forfeit tho this Goku is closer to DB Goku than DBZ Goku meaning that he is more stubborn and would rather lose than quit.,dbz,d1peg7d,4,t5_2sdu8

I told my friend the other day when discussing what they could do inbetween arcs after the CopyVegeta thing came out that they could in theoryHave Vegeta drink the water splinter off into a ragefilled Vegeta with the full power of SSB. Because of this that CopyVegeta ended up killing Beerus to usurp his position because no longer was he held back by his familial limitationsduties. Whis already asked if hed take over someday possibly so Whis seeing the younger more energetic Vegeta agrees to his proposal of taking over and strips Beerus of his power enough for CopyVegeta to defeat him.This then causes another AndroidCelllike ripple effect into the future where Future Trunks once again has to return and help stop CopyVegeta from achieving his goals.Future TrunksGood VegetaGohanWeakened Goku then step up to try and take down SSB CopyVegeta. Maybe even allowing Good Vegeta to finally get the final blow on the main villain of an arc. Taking some of his rage back in exchange to weaken CopyVegeta enough for them to win.EDIT The reason why Whis is stronger and Beerus attendant is because he is basically his moderator. He distributes the God Of Destructions power as he sees fit. With the rise of GokuVegeta it would be clear their fast growth to filling the power gap could mean Goku is the balance to CopyVegetas God Of Destruction powers. So Whis would see no real problem with taking the power and handing it to CopyVegeta. But since Goku weakened himself with KaioKen he ends up being defeated and CopyVegeta ends up fucking the whole Universe up to the point where Future Trunks has to come back and try to fix everything once again.,dbz,d2y7ny7,-6,t5_2sdu8

IIRC it was because Demigra couldnt control those stronger than him or those who had godly ki meaning Goku and Beerus had natural immunity and this was before SSB Vegeta.

The Daizenshuu indicates that Cell remembered it when he was teleporting with Goku and makes no mention of Gokus genetic material mingling with his.

I even think its possible for a larger number of people. However since its quite hard for both parties to strike that delicate balance its very difficult for two extremely different people to fuse. In that sense synchronized swimmers would probably be really good at Fusion. By the way there are many different types of Fusion and the kind Goku learned is the one for increasing battle power.gt If a man and a woman fused maybe theyd end up like a drag queen? A superduper strong drag queen it might be kind of interesting. I should have drawn that back during the serialization. laughs I kind of regret not doing it.

7908920,0,t3_4nkxki, I dislike Super in general everything is a mess. The art is awful the animation is okay at times but the art drags it down very significantly. The aging of most characters makes no sense. I hate the character designs the  special character designs shouldve and couldve been used instead. The characters arent the same as they used to be. The only real notable events in the series were Vegeta vs Cabba and Goku vs Hit. I dont care for Trunks or the new arc. Im only hoping that its not a letdown like everything else so far. The blue hair thing annoys me. inconsistencies annoy me I liked Mai in Dragonball but her and Trunks relation makes no sense and seems somewhat forced. The  year age gap is pushing it and I hope theres a reasonable and logical explanation for their relationship Toriyama is not and never was a great story writer. Dragonball is the best series to me in the franchise. The story is more simple so theres less chances to make mistakes. ChiChi was a lot more bearable and cute all the Zfighters were able to actually fight along side Goku and the character interactions that certain people like to say is a good point of Super lol were actually character interactions in Dragonball and were at its peak then This subredditor fanbase? is awful. Anyone who negatively criticizes Super will surely be downvoted into oblivion anyone who says anything about GT will be treated the same. Its probably only the childrenwho seem to make up the majority of this subreddit that do this but whatever. Too many inconsistencies are being excused by the community and I feel it doesnt help the series in any way.  Dragonball DBZ was great for its time but there are A LOT more better animes out there. Seeing Super in its current state makes me wonder why it had even returned. Watching Super made me rewatch DB up until Cell Saga. Super has absolutely nothing on anything leading up to said events. Its honestly quite saddening and a disgrace to the DB series which is why its just Super to me. The dubs are overrated all forms and I used to love Faulconers soundtrack until I realized when I rewatched the series how much it did not fit the series.

I also have my own style but Im still more focused on learning hence why I am using references all the time. Once I feel confident in my own style I will for sure begin exploring that. But you gotta learn to stand before you can walk and right now I just wanna draw things that makes me happy and honor the artists that I look up to by trying my best at their work. What you believe is up to you. I have said everything I can the only thing left for me to do is show you how I draw. Once I begin streaming I will PM you and draw Goku in your honor.

Frost didnt force Goku to transform. If anything what is indicated is that Goku transformed specifically to force Frost to transform to his final form and not that he transformed out of necessity. Additionally Frost when fighting Piccolo was drastically weakened due to the damage he had taken from his fight with Goku.gt Future Trunks SSJ is at least near SSJ Goku in this most recent episode. Again Goku didnt indicate he needed to transform or anything but rather that he did it just because Trunks had transformed and then transformed to Super Saiyajin  just to show that form off to Trunks as well. Even without godly ki Goku and the others can still suppress their power in transformed states.,dbz,d4qfd15,4,t5_2sdu8

He was reluctant with the first few fusions with Nail and Kami. Im sure there would be hesitation to fuse with other versions of himself especially since he knows it could negatively affect the other timelines. With this theory it would also be possible for anyone to go to the past and fuse with themselves if they had enough potara earrings. I wonder what side effects the potara would have  like would it keep the same being or create a new one even if its technically the same person being fused.And referring to your last point  at this point we are still unsure if Black is even a saiyan... what Im getting at is this say Black were to be in the form of Piccolo instead of Goku. We wouldnt be able to confirm if he were Namekian at least with the info we have right now thus he may not have the ability to complete the Namekian fusion.,dbz,d4rdqwh,2,t5_2sdu8

8109758,0,t3_4qb89o,gt Trunks reality did not change after he went back in time to defeat Cell. Vegeta and crew are still dead. The world is mostly destroyed but being rebuilt. Yet when Whis and Beerus explained it in the most recent episode they claimed it was a crime because a small change could have a massive ripple effect on the future. Why then is Trunks future not changed? Whis specifically commented that it caused a massive ripple effect on the future of the timeline being traveled to not just a massive ripple in general which is what we saw happen with Trunks incursions into the past during the Cell arc. Because Trunks was traveling to the present timeline his small changed to the present timeline caused massive ripples to it resulting in a drastic change from what would have transpired otherwise how Trunks timeline turned out.gt Going back to the DB Super story when they explained alternate universes before the tournament they had they all seemed drastically different and did not mirror each other at all. So while there may be  or  alternate universes Future Trunks time line does not exist in any of them. Otherwise this could account for having an alternate reality. The twelve universes arent alternate planes of reality but are physical locations existing within the same plane. Their relationship with one another and their multiverse would be like that of galaxies within a universe. In Trunks timeline there would exist the twelve universes as well virtually identical to the twelve in the present timeline apart from any deviations that may have taken place after the timelines diverged.,dbz,d4rlylo,3,t5_2sdu8

Why would Frosts power level be SSG level in the anime but not in the manga?gtFrost was weakened considerably due to the beating he took up to that point. By the time that Piccolo got to him he was nowhere near as strong as he was beforehand.Dont exaggerate how bad the beating actually was. SS Vegeta beat up Cabba much much worse than what SS Goku did to Frost and Cabba still had more than enough energy left to turn SS against Vegeta. We see characters get beatings all the time and do well despite those beatings. gtWhos to say he needed to? All he did was transform just because Trunks did likely due to respect more than anything else.In the next ep preview Goku goes SSJ against Black you can tell from his hair.

8260970,0,t3_4sl71n, Its been one posted many many times but the facts dont support it at all. Individuals arent duplicated between the two universes. While races and worlds are individuals to the best of our knowledge arent duplicated. So theres no Goku no Vegeta etc over in Universe . Humans in the Dragon Ball franchise isnt a term meant solely for Earthlings. Its a broad term used for any species of the lower world that just appears humanoid. Both Saiyajin and Namekians have been referred to as humans before so dont assume that hes going solely after Earth when he refers to his dislike and distrust of humanity. Super spoilerss Recent information has connected Black to Universe  as the apprentice Kaioushin of Universe  Zamasu is indicated to have ki extraordinarily similar to Blacks. Given the fact that we know Black has connections to the Kaioushin in some fashion anyway due to the Time Ring and his Potara the fact that he has that connection to Zamasu heavily indicates that his origins are in some fashion related to Universe  not  In Trunks time Universe s Earth would still not have a population as its population wouldnt have been restored by the Dragon Balls. Given that U Earths population wiped themselves out due to a war there doesnt really seem to be any reason for there to be a connection between the two even in a superficial sense.,dbz,d5a6gsd,6,t5_2sdu8

Honestly comparing the animation and fighting it seems like Gohan and Vegito were around even ground. Gohan was stomping Super Buu and Vegito was stomping him too.

So its up to anyone pretty much but  most people agree that the source material is above all else which is the manga.Also in discussions people  ignore fillers for the sake of consistency. Toriyama has his way of how the world works and the animation company has their own. For example people question why villains  evil people keep their bodies in hell but they dont. The hell shown in the anime is filler and never shown in the manga until Resurection F which is created by Toriyama himself. They look totally different and work in a different manner too. ,dbz,d6bl6ju,2,t5_2sdu8

8573129,0,t3_4x6bcm,From uvlorsutes I believe his latter point is accurate with what the show has indicated and shown God Ki can be switched off and ongt Additionally given what we see with it being a positional job it can be inferred that you are only a god when you actually assume the mantle of Kami. Only in the position of Kami do you have access to the godly powers associated with the role and only when occupying it can one sense godly ki. Since Piccolo never occupied it and Kami ceased to exist when he merged with Piccolo thus vacating the position Piccolo wouldnt have access to those godly powers or be able to sense godly ki as a result.,dbz,d6d81vu,1,t5_2sdu8
8573575,0,t3_4x84aj,If were talking in terms of power yes Hit is stronger. He was fighting SSB KK x Goku evenly and he wasnt even using any of his killing techniques.

8703643,0,t3_4z5zor,I think SSG and SSB are excellent. The original  SS forms were just progressively longer hair and then a lack of eyebrows its not like they were a revolutionary bout of creativity. Im pretty sure Toriyama has said he initially designed SS kind of as a joke on how absurd things were getting and his editors loved it  I could totally be misremembering this but Id believe it. The only really creative jump was SS which was unfortunately relegated to GT and never got to do anything particularly interesting. SSG is much much more designed than SS or even . The hair is similar to base form but actually different flowing upwards skin tone changes eyes change hair color changes Goku gets thinner and his aura is bananas. SSB isnt as big a departure from SS but still is given plenty of inuniverse explanation for its design choices. Calm tranquil and fueled by Godki. So its blue has a quiet flowing aura and can even be combined with Kaioken. The new forms are a different direction from the old ones but they put a lot of thought into the new design choices and I like them more. ,dbz,d6tl7ml,1,t5_2sdu8

Weaken the opponent then take him out with their trump card.But this didnt matter much because Buu doesnt lose stamina unless fighting another Buu and Buu was just killing time with them anyhow.

8837978,0,t1_d79s4uq,The time rings dont allow you to travel into the past so they are incapable of creating new timelines. The future is not set in stone so new timelines are not created when you travel to the future thats why gods are allowed to travel to the future but not to the past. We only know one way of traveling to the past Trunkss time machine. But obviously someone has figured out how to do it at some point or there wouldnt be restrictions against it.Black was only able to travel to the main timeline the past though it isnt actually the past of Trunkss timeline because of the temporal disturbance caused by Trunkss time machine which reacted with his time ring even though its not capable of traveling to the past on its own. Once that disturbance settled he was pulled back into Trunkss timeline and he realized that he wouldnt be able to return to the other timeline.Also if Zamasu is going to do anything like that with Goku he hasnt done it yet. He had never seen the time rings before we saw them and there were already  green ones at that time. So the th is a mystery.Technically we dont know for sure that any of those green rings are representative of Trunkss time travel because none of his timelines branch off from the main timeline of the story. Instead the main timeline branches off of Trunkss timeline and the other two timelines dont directly touch the main timeline at all. But it does seem reasonable that the green rings represent all temporal universes with any relationship to the main timeline whatsoever i.e. they were the same at some point in the past so the th remains a mystery.By the way all references to the unseen timeline where the Trunks who was killed by Cell obtained the blueprints for the androids were removed in more recent guide books perhaps because the inconsistencies were acknowledged not that forgetting about that timeline helps much...it just didnt explain enough in the first place. So maybe were expected to believe that only two of the green rings represent the known alternate universe Trunkss and Cells.Finally it may be that Zeno has the power to destroy alternate timelines. There seems to have been no other reason to drop the implication that he destroyed  whole universes at once. In that case Cells timeline and the unseen timeline might have already been destroyed. We only know for sure that the main timeline and Trunkss timeline still exist.,dbz,d7a77o8,1,t5_2sdu8

8861805,0,t3_51l9hb,Actually... Zamasu belongs to a different universe so splitting Us timeline would not affect him considering that when Black first performed interuniversal travel he arrived at the original timeline instead of the DBZ one.Now original is in quotes because in reality the original U timeline ends with Trunks returning to the future kills the androids then Cell kills him and travels back in time. However it wouldnt make sense for Black to go to that Universe because theres no way for the plot to develop.Or maybe he did go into that timeline first eliminated all of mankind without any resistance then learned that somehow theres an alternate timeline and decided to eliminate it as well but this time Trunks is there to stand up to him.We dont know much about Black yet so we can safely assume he already wiped life off of one timeline.As for GodTube the fight was an Interdimensional event perhaps streamed by some god or superior entity which is why Gowasu was able to watch it even when Zamasu didnt have legitimate access as of yet to the DBZ timeline.Imma end it heremy head hurts,dbz,d7d2blv,-1,t5_2sdu8

9004363,0,t3_53l061,I have a question and maybe its stupid I dont know but how does Black know of Goku? Weirdly enough Future Trunks timeline is the intended timeline the one we follow in Dragonball is an alternate one created by Trunks himself when he went back in time. Everyone who is a Dragonball fan should know that So how does Black know of Goku? If we go by Future Trunks timeline Goku died before the androids and at that point he had only defeated Frieza though an amazing feat for someone from earthplanet Vegeta it wouldnt have given him a high enough status to be known through countless other universe universe  for example heck Frieza was only a prominent force in the North galaxy of universe  and even if Frieza knew and had met Beerus during beerus time awake it seemed common for him to just pop in on anyone as he did so when he visited King Vegeta who on a scale would be vastly weaker than Piccolo. Now Black is possibly from universe  and even if hes not hes from a timeline Goku never lived to reach a level that even got him to meet a Supreme Kai so how does Black someone who seems to be heading for God Level power and status know of Goku someone who died as someone so insignificantly in his own timeline. Add to that why is it that Trunks timeline is the altered one of the time rings and we know its the altered timeline because black is wearing the same grey ring shown in the anime which is stated as the altered timeline where as the other rings are green. Also Whis stated that all the universe are twins of each other  and   and   and   and   and   and  And because of that they only parallel each other and the others are completely different from each other therefore meaning the only other universe that can have another Goku would be universe  so Black cant be some other Goku. But timelines another Goku can be taken from there yes but the weird thing is why go to another timeline? Zamasu is intent on destroying all humans because he believes them a curse of such but why start destroying future trunks timeline when it doesnt effect the timeline Zamasu is from and he mustnt be from the future timeline because like I said Goku would of never met Zamasu. What annoys me is how Zamasu refers to every being as human is confusing. And why does Zamasu even care about anything that happens in the other universes? Hes a Kai of universe  and the universes are so huge and separated from each other so why come to universe ? Unless hes gone and killed every life form from universe  and is just going through and killing everything and if so why hasnt the King of all killed him yet for taking on the job of a God of destruction? Like if he has gone through and killed a whole universe that must bring him some attention but Black was only at the power of a heightened Super Saiyan  when he first fought against Goku so its not like there wasnt someone powerful enough to kill him I mean he would have literally had no chance against Beerus it doesnt make sense! There are so many things I dont understand about Super and this new arc there are so many things that have been just crazy stupid and Id love to be proven wrong l about all these things plaguing me.,dbz,d7u6ng7,2,t5_2sdu8

9018411,0,t3_53rhn6,Just for funsies heres how I see the whole timelines mess.First off this is MY interpretation of how the DBZ Timelines work. I know theres an official version with four timelines but this is not it. In this I assume that every time the time machine is used a new timeline is created except I missed a few of the future timelines when Trunks returned to the future. I could add them but effort.I wrote this on the train to work using my memories of reading the manga and watching the anime  years ago so please correct anything I got wrong.First in Timeline  Goku Instant Transmissions and kills MechaFreeza and King Cold. Goku dies from Heart disease and Androids kill everyone.Trunks travel back in time and warns everyone  gives Goku medicine. This creates Timeline .Trunks return to Timeline  future I guess because the time machine has created some kind of link between these two timelines. Everone in Timeline  prepare for the Androids.Trunks returns to Timeline  during the battle with the Androids creating Timeline  in the process and they find a way to deactivate the Androids using a remote. They do so and then Trunks return to future Timeline  and deactivates the Androids there.Later when Trunks tries to return to Timeline  cell kills him takes the time machine and travels even further into the past. This creates Timeline .Timeline  in turn quickly becomes Timeline  when Trunks from Timeline  arrives. Everything happens like in Timeline  up to when Trunks returns again which creates Timeline .In Timeline  Cell appears prompting everyone to train harder including Trunks. After Cell is defeated Trunks travels back to Timeline  but because of his power boost he creates a new timeline of the future lets call it Timeline  where he destroys the Androids and Cell. So Timeline  Everyones dead including Trunks.Timeline  The Zfighters deactivate the Androids and live happily ever after or until Buu atleast. No Cell.Timeline  Same as Timeline  but Trunks helps them and gets a remote to bring back with him.Timeline  No Trunks so Goku dies of heart disease androids kill everyone and Cell appears becomes Perfect Cell by absorbing the Androids and rules the universedies fighting Buukills Buudies against Beeruswho knows. Everyones dead.Timeline  Trunks appears only once Goku survives and Cell may or may not become Perfect and there may or may not be a Cell Tournament. Im not sure how much of an impact Trunks had during the Cell part of the Android Saga. Most likely Cell wins. Everyone dies.Timeline  The Main Timeline. Cell is defeated by Gohan and a poweredup Trunks return to the future. Everyone lives happily until Buu.Timeline  The Main Future Timeline. Trunks defeats the Androids and Cell and lives happily ever after or until Buu and then Black anyway.,dbz,d7vveit,-2,t5_2sdu8

9026937,0,t3_53wkyd,Cell probably wouldve sensed Daburas energy and challenged him. Babidi acknowledges his strength and tries to enslave him. Cell lets himself get put under control by him as to power up just like Vegeta did. Cell has Vegetas cells so lets assume he can make his own choices like Vegeta as well. Cell now with the power up Babidi gave him now starta to pummel Dabura to a pulp. Before Cell can kill him Babidi tells him that if he had let him revive his monster Majin Buu that he would put Cells power to shame. Cell now intrigued lets Babidi revive Majin Buu sacrificing Daburas and the rest of his minions power plus some Cell Jrs to revive the monster. Cell realizes that Majin Buu is on another level of his own after sensing the enormous amount of ki generated by the pink monster. Before Cell can flee Majin Buu absorbs Cell into his being and becomes Majin Buu Perfect. With his increased intelligence and strength he proceeds to kill Babidi as he now sees him unfit as a master. He proceeds to travel the Universe searching for a worthy opponent.,dbz,d7ww9of,85,t5_2sdu8

9059206,0,t1_d80q0vt,this is different because time rings dont create new timelines. The order is different normally a new timeline is created first just by travelling in the first place thus the counterparts are disconnected. Here there is no new timeline thanks to how the ring works these Zamasus are the exact same being across both timelinesjust for the sake of this arguement we dont know this for sure the act of creating a new timeline would now come after killing present Zamasu. The core is question is why? Why would it create another timeline instead of erasing Future Zamasu?Really the answer is just because not like theres a big scientific bible of how time works in the DB universe Im fine with that answer but I felt like making a thread cause time travel talk is fun.So yes this is just academic I dont believe any of this is going to happen either.,dbz,d80rrq3,2,t5_2sdu8

Vegeta has been the Worf of DBS he is the dude who gets his butt kicked to show off how strong the bad guy is. As for characters Bulma has always been the main woman of the dragon ball series.

However if you act out your body will be taken away and you will become a simple soul. Hence Goku punching Bojack is the only time he has interacted outside of his permitted one day in Buu Saga. Which brings to the next point if they were given bodies Beerus and Supreme Kai couldnt interact outside Other World. Future Beerus wouldnt be able to intervene with Black and Zamasu hes stuck on his planet presumably. And about Old Kai we see that after Dabura turns the sword to stone he immediately vaporizes it which would kill Old Kai as he was becoming released from it.

Once hes switched places with Goku he kills Gokus normal body.  This leaves us with future Zamasu stuck inside Gokus body as Black. So the Zamasu we saw WITH Black in this episode which Zamasu is this? Is this the past one from before he went to the future to swap with Goku? Am I going insane?

9178487,0,t1_d8epojp,Also Goku is an asshole with a heart of gold. Goku is consistently unreliable and at times can be just as prideful as Vegeta BUT also has a heart of gold to always do the right thing. Despite what everyone says about abandoning Gohan during the Cell Games he chose to die because AT THAT TIME Gohan was so strong that he felt the world didnt need him anymore and the earth was almost destroyed a handful of times Freezer Androids Cell all of them created for the sole purpose of battling him. And you know what? When he died the world was at peace for  years. Buu only became a serious issue because of Gokus fight with Vegeta. if Vegeta brought that power out and teamed up with Gohan he probably wouldve obliterated Babidi and Dabura before Buu even had the chance to wake. And Goku being a warrior understood Vegetas motivations and that they need to fight because this is Vegetas catharsis. Even in fighting Vegeta Goku was trying to help him. Goku has made some questional decisions but hes a good hearted person who is also really really childish. He is absolutely not above showing off and it worked to his advantage a few times such as when he decided to demonstrate Super Saiyan forms to Babidi to buy time for Trunks. ,dbz,d8ffuzf,1,t5_2sdu8

That is why Cell had to hide from Piccolo until he absorbed more people. Piccolo was more than capable of killing Cell easily something Piccolo said in his frustration when Cell escaped.

At the moment Beerus did his hakai thing one Zamasu was chilling in the future another Zamasu was in Gokus body and another Zamasu was being hakaied. Even if at the same date Black wasnt wearing the ring at the same moment he was wearing it.That doesnt work either. There has to be a reason why one Zamasu was wearing the Time Ring and the other wasnt and the only reason that would even make sense is an alternate timeline. But people are trying to say that there is no alternate timeline that Black was simply protected because he was wearing a time ring. Either he was or he wasnt.,dbz,d8ruus4,1,t5_2sdu8

We recently finished and got to the Buu saga where we switched to the original as he hates watching anything subbed. As a lifelong Dragon Ball fan I much prefer Kai and personally wouldve preferred watching Kai Buu saga in Japanese.I feel the voices pacing and picture quality are much better in Kai despite production hell and while filler episodes have more slice of life character development which is great that character development is usually later overwritten by canon episodes so as a result add very little over all.

9312738,0,t1_d8wcda8,I know. What Im saying is that black existed instantly in Trunks timeline because once a multiverse comes into being all time exists and has been written. Since Black had a future at some point that time happened and he went to Trunks future from the get go. or he went in as soon as he could possibly have slipped in. My theory mostly comes from the fact that the time flow between Trunks time and the main timeline seem to flow at the same time.This kind of helps explain why Trunks would come to a time before Black would have existed since Black existed in the main timeline on a different part of the th dimensional plane the time axis,dbz,d8wghzg,1,t5_2sdu8

In the anime though he doesnt seem to really care if the twins die or not but then the Supreme Kais were all killed too so... It doesnt add up why NO ONE WAS TOLD. The four Kais of each universe  north south west east Kais  would probably sense the Supreme Kais of their universe just suddenly dying andor know about their God of Destruction dying since I think King Kaithe Supreme KaiElder Kai were all able to sense Beerus waking up.,dbz,d8wtqrb,2,t5_2sdu8

9329941,0,t3_589zx6, In Dragon Ball were never told how it kills the user and given the physical exhaustion we see the users in when they perform the sealing then its very likely due to a drain of ki and thus Goku having a far larger reserve would allow him to use it without killing him outright. Additionally it could be based on the strength of the individual being sealed that determines how lethal it is to the individual doing the sealing as Daimao was far stronger than both Mutaito and Roshi whereas Turtle isnt anywhere near as strong as Goku. Besides we saw Tenshinhan practicing in a similar manner to Goku when he was learning it for the sake of sealing Daimao but that training never killed him either. Piccolo was able to seal away Kami who himself didnt die from firing his a benevolent and good deity with a reverse Mafuuba stated in official sources as simply being a more powerful Mafuuba than the one being fired at him so the targets malevolence or evil was never a true requirement to begin with.,dbz,d8ymz84,17,t5_2sdu8

9344734,0,t3_58fy3d,Ive got a LOT of ideas for how to rework and improve GT. In fact Ive been very gradually putting those ideas into fanfiction form for a while now. They include... Starting with a reunion tournament that gets interrupted naturally by the Black Star dragons summoning. A better backstory for the Black Star Dragon Balls themselves Piccolo is a Warriortype. Hes got nothing to do with any set of Dragon Balls anymore. Goku is still accidentally turned back into a kid via Pilafs wish but it doesnt stick. Something turns him back duringafter the Baby arc. Streamlining the hunt for the Black Star Dragon Balls somewhat. Some events will be reorganized some characters will be revamped Redgic Lood reassigned Mutchy the ParaPara Bros or omitted entirely Doltaki probably Occasionally cutting back to Earth for short sidestories featuring the supporting cast. A better backstory for Baby than the messy Tsufrian scientists who created Baby who created Myu to create him to do whatever hodgepodge.  A halfway sensible power scale once the big battles of the Baby arc get underway. None of this Gohan goes Super Saiyan on top of Ultimate but Goku fends both him and Goten off in base form bologna. Sugoro and his son are gone. Completely. Good lord were they annoying and pointless. Sugoroku Space would be heavily reworked and used in some other context though. More worthwhile involvement from other characters besides SS Goku like Piccolo Pan Oob the boys etc in the final battle with BabyVegeta. Massive reworking of the Super  arc. Holy moley that one made pretty much zero sense. But its worth keeping to serve as a segue into the Shadow Dragons. I would minimize Gokus involvement and use the S arc as an opportunity to showcase the supporting fighters Vegeta Piccolo Gohan GotenTrunksGotenks Oob more. Rework the Shadow Dragons themselves to be a little less ridiculous in a bad way than in GT. Have the heroes split up into small teams to go face them instead of the arc almost solely featuring Goku and Pan. A resolution to the battle with Super Yi Xing Long other than yet another Spirit Bomb Id do something involving the Dragon Fist instead and an actual reason for Goku to leave with Shenlong afterward.Overall the big points would be  less focus on Goku  more story and strength consistency  revamping or omitting Toeis handful of shortcomings with new characters and settings.,dbz,d90ifvl,3,t5_2sdu8

Also I just dislike reducing their power and ability to some objective exact quantity.I prefer to think of the guidebooks as wholly non canon as basically saying in a roundabout way that Vegito is greater than the sum of his parts. He not only has the good fighting qualities of both Goku and Vegeta but those qualities are improved upon by the mix. He has Gokus good instincts tempered by Vegetas alertness.

9532288,0,t1_d9o1l64, Id disagree. At least in the Cell saga Goku was able to witness Gohans dormant power in the RoSaT. He knew that once Gohan let loose Cell would be no match. And I think he was sure of that after fighting Cell himself which is why he went first. You could argue whether giving Cell a senzu was clever but then again it wasnt out of character he gave a chance to Raditz Vegeta and Freeza too It doesnt make any sense because Goku himself doesnt get nowhere near the sort of powerups Black does. Trunks is indeed half sayan but hes no Gohan and if we go by the anime he got his ass handed to him by SSJ Goku and SSB Vegeta before Vegeta went back to train some more. The fact that through rage alone hes able to surpass SSB Vegeta is puzzling. And of course one could question how come he was unable to get such powerup before... Vegeta has seen great development in Super and particularly in this arc. Goku has simply been a disappointment. He could be seriousfunny but at least battle smart. So far....I have seen nothing of sorts with the exception of the fight against Hit.,dbz,d9o1z48,1,t5_2sdu8

9622420,0,t3_5csxuu,Vegetto is for Japan mostly its more popular there and a lot of translations just take the Vegetto which comes from Vegeta and Kakarotto. Interesting thing is that in English is Kakarot so if your read the English translated manga its not Vegito at all is Vegerot.Vegito comes from the Funimation translation where its also Kakarot so they also took the last two letters reversed it for to and kept the i in the Vegeta pronunciation keeping the i as part of the name.

9623441,0,t1_d9z8jcl,gt By Gohans own admission the boys were on the verge of surpassing him and if he didnt pick up the pace soon they were going to do so.He didnt mean they were going to surpass him any time soon. He just acknowledged that at their age they were far stronger than he was at the same age. Naturally if they kept up that insane level of growth they would surpass him. Soon is an arbitrary amount of time. He could mean by the time they get to his current age. He could mean by the time they get to the age he was when he beat Cell. He could mean within the next year. All he knows is that if he doesnt train they will surpass him at some point.Youre also looking too much into that Vegeta fight. He didnt want to use any more power than he had already decided to use because that would take the fun and challenge out of it. Goku and Vegeta almost never use their full power or even anything close to their full power until theyre absolutely pushed to do so. If theyre just training with their children theyre going to use a smaller portion of their full power thats more in line with where they think their son is at. He was struggling to defend against Trunks because he had underestimated how much power he needed to use to defend himself with. But he wasnt going to just draw out more power and end the fight instantly. That wouldnt have satisfied him. Once he noticed how strong Trunks really was he wanted to fight him with the amount of power he had already preallocated. It wasnt until he actually got hit that he drew more power out. And this isnt because he was angry. Its because he was surprised and just simply reacted without really thinking about it. As soon as he landed that punch he realized what he did and looked shocked because he didnt mean to hit Trunks that hard. Then it shows Trunks crying with a pretty nasty mark on his face. Trunks doesnt perk back up again until after Vegeta cheered him up by saying hed take him to the park. Vegeta doesnt even use his full power against his enemies until its necessary. What could possibly make you think he would use more than like  of it against his own son? At least to start out the fight with. Hed naturally start using more and more as necessary. Thats how Vegeta and Goku operate. Its how they fight. Its only natural to assume their starting point would be much lower when theyre just sparring especially against children. As for that Dazenshuu quote that doesnt mean Buu Saga Goten is as strong as Buu Saga Gohan. Its just saying that because hes Gokus son Gotens potential for power is no less than what Gohans potential for power was. The wording is a bit confusing but battle power is not synonymous with power level. Even then strength isnt solely measured by power level. If that Daizenshuu quote literally meant that Goten was as powerful as Gohan then your quote from Gohan doesnt make any sense because Gohan definitely implies that Goten is still weaker than him. Hes afraid that Goten could become stronger than him within an undefined amount of time that is but he doesnt state anything about Goten currently being as strong as him. Otherwise he would have been much more frightened.You cant really compare base Gotenks fight with Fat Buu to Majin Vegetas fight with Fat Buu because Majin Vegeta didnt really fight Buu. He just blew himself up. If Buu didnt have his absolutely ridiculous regenerative factor that attack would have killed him several times over. My point was that Super Saiyan  Goku was a lot stronger than Super Saiyan  Gotenks because SS Goku wrecked Fat Buu while SS Gotenks had trouble with Super Buu. Remember that Fat Buu and Super Buu are equal in strength. One of them just has the Grand Supreme Kais influence keeping him calm while the other has managed to silence the effect of Grand Supreme Kais influence. But both possess the same level of strength. They only differed in their personalities. So my ultimate point was to show that Goten and Trunks are nowhere near their fathers in terms of strength. Therefore we cannot say that the fusion dance is weaker than the Potara fusion. This wont be resolved until someone fuses with both versions. Either Goten and Trunks need to use Potaras Trunten? or Goku and Vegeta need to fuse into Gogeta. Then well need some comment from someone thats able to sense their power or from the fused being itself directly comparing it to the other fusion. Either Gogeta saying hes weakerstronger than Vegito or Trunten saying hes weakerstronger than Gotenks. Until such a thing happens we wont be able to definitely state which fusion is stronger. ,dbz,d9zad61,4,t5_2sdu8

The random techniques the fluctuation in animation and story telling is different too.Did this dude just slash into a different dimension ON ACCIDENT and ACCIDENTLY made clones of himself to fight?Animation I understand theres budget and time issues due to churning out weekly episodes. Better animation but wait years between arcs vs new episodes now.But since when has dragon ball been about arguing about right and wrong? Why the fuck are they trying to have a moral debate here? DB has always been about fighting and less talk about good and evil just cheesy oneliners about how the other person is going to lose. Red ribbon army mercenary tao king piccolo piccolo vegeta freeza androids cell and buu they arent trying to preach every single minute to justify their actions.

Now this wouldnt be a huge issue had DB had separate American cartoon productions amp a different continuity ala Voltron...but Dragon Ball partially due to Toeis bungling of the foreign distribution amp partially because...thats what it is...its a very Japaneseonly production basically like  of anime. I mean its not like they integrated the Americanized version into the actual show ala Sonic or Nintendo stuff..Im not even sure if Toei gets a massive cut of DBs sales I know the dub VAs dont. I think they moreorless allow Fukunaga amp co. to do what they think will make the most money for their property. Opinions on art vs. business aside the way that Toei handled the licensing definitely alters the understanding of new stuff that ShueishaToei puts out in Japan. amp Im not sure theyre that interested in fixing the issue when you consider that theyve moreorless left our market alone ala again  of anime overall amp had the recent proliferation of immediate fansubs keep FUNi in check.

9685288,0,t1_da6uma6,Thanks man. I think that the two base theory is something that fans have created in order to try to make sense out of senseless writing. The show never tells us anything like that at all so people are just trying to fill in the blanks.I honestly think that the writers either forgot about goku and vegeta absorbing that power into their base and super saiyan forms or I think that they wanted to retcon it and were too lazy to offer an explanation.It doesnt really make sense to me that goku would want to power down from SSG powers to normal SS which should be like dozens of times weaker at least to test trunks. What would he learn from that? It also wouldnt really make sense for him to get excited about blacks strength when trunks says black was as strong or maybe stronger than a normal ss.Regardless we dont know because the show doesnt tell us.,dbz,da6x0l2,1,t5_2sdu8

9686649,0,t1_da71nh9,First off the universe bursting was from the clash of powers. The issue was that their powers was so massive and raw that it caused shockwaves through the universe.Second would be that Goku in BoG after getting used to that form... he refined and kept his power in check but it was still not enough.So the third point was that Beerus used his strength to protect the universe so he can fight longer so he can enjoy the fight more. Basically he did not care about the universe being destroyed but rather he wanted to enjoy the fight so he used his power to keep the destruction of the universe in check.Fourth future Zamasu and Black were nowhere near the level of Beerus same for Goku. Also the only one who might have surpassed or same level of Beerus might have been either fused Zamasu and Vegito.Fifth even if their powers were enought to destroy the universe... it is different than before. A bit of my head canon or conclusion is that Goku and co are used to their powers and are more controlled. Compared to Goku going ssg into a new world of power where that raw uncontrolled power clashing with Beerus powerremember it was Beeruss power the same power that clashed with Champa was enought to destroy  universes was not mastered. Now we have a ssb stronger than ssg Goku but... he has better control of his power it is not raw anymore but rather a refined power. Like how our heroes in DBZ had a hard time controlling their strength for the punching machine... it takes a lot more to control power and so on.,dbz,da7328z,2,t5_2sdu8

Have him start getting creative with his powers and bring out the spacial rift again. Then Trunks could get in his final blow without pulling a Spirit Bomb from betwixt his cheeks.That way Trunks gets his victory Black and Zamasu get their comeuppance no one else has to die and Trunkss timeline is spared.

The movies themselves were actually very good in my opinion.  In Super they butchered the movies with terrible artwork and animation.  Thankfully the art and animation has improved dramatically in recent episodes.  If you liked DBZ you will probably like Dragon Ball Super.

9757847,0,t1_dafu6ty,Its never outright stated but there are plenty of context clues.Even though Trunks is a newborn at the time Bulma mentions how she hasnt seen Vegeta in several months. Its not very likely that he went to space became a Super Saiyan came back and had sex with Bulma then left again for seemingly no reason. We already know he prefers training in the Gravity Chamber that was the original reason he stayed with Bulma so why would he go anywhere else after achieving Super Saiyan?Also the fact that a new Super Saiyan was extremely noticeable by anyone than can sense power levels. The major goal of Gokus training in the time chamber other than having Gohan ascend was learning how to control the Super Saiyan state. It was constantly leaking energy. The only reason the others didnt know about Vegeta ascending was because he did it while offplanet but once he was back on Earth it would have been very easy to sense him using the Super Saiyan transformation since he had not yet learned how to control it properly. I find it difficult to believe that Vegeta would achieve Super Saiyan then come back to Earth and not utilize the form in some capacity while training. If that had happened somebody would have sensed it.Since this didnt happen and adding in the fact that Bulma the person he lived with and would have the best idea of his whereabouts had not seen him since before he left chances are Vegeta did not come back to Earth until just prior to  and  first appearing. In fact his battle with  shows just how inexperienced he still is with transforming. Turning Super Saiyan clearly requires a good amount of effort for Vegeta he even wavers back and forth to his base form for a few moments. This is a strong indication that Vegeta has only just recently ascended. By the time this fight occurs though Trunks had already been born meaning his conception was approximately  months prior to that. Considering all of this its very unlikely that Vegeta was a Super Saiyan prior to conceiving Trunks.,dbz,dafvfrr,3,t5_2sdu8

9795091,0,t3_5f33iv,IMHO Future Trunks single handedly ruined this arc. Its still my Favorite in dragon ball overall but the ending and his power boosts were super annoying. I know that its his arc and he needs to shine and be relevant but still that was just too much. Everything was ruined just so that he can get the finishing blow and be the one who saves the future. When they first landed in the future and Vegeta fought Black That episode was so good that i literally watched it more than  times. and the following episodes kept on getting better and better. Then the bullshit starts and his power boosts started kicking in the hype slowly died in me but i still kept going because its good. I think part of the problem is that the show just sucks in terms of showing damage showing who is stronger and what not. For example If someone is fucking x stronger than someone else he shouldnt be pushed off and getting his ass kicked. even if the damage is negligible weaker characters just should not be able to do that. Just like the case with when beerus was first introduced we didnt see goku or vegeta stomping him to the ground even though theyre not inflicting any damage. With this arc we saw Trunks just shitting on Black Goku as if they are on the same level but it doesnt make any sense for him to be so. Black couldve literally killed him right in the spot but you know its dragonball no villan wants to finish the main characters because either they cant because of plot armor or they would eventually just get wished back and life is beautiful.  ,dbz,dakggdr,1,t5_2sdu8

9799028,0,t1_dakjb7w,The thing Sumitomos score does not do that I wish it would do is incorporate memorable character themes. Kikuchi had some memorable themes such as Piccolos throughout DBZ and again in Kai. Team Faulconer did a lot with character themes especially by the Buu arc where Babidis theme and all of the Buu themes were variations on the same basic song. To me much of Sumitomos score feels like something youd get if you bought a collection of royaltyfree BGM tracks online by the same composer. They dont have a throughline they dont necessarily sound all that great and there are only one or two standout tracks. By the same token Ive always felt they are unobtrusive in Super. The track where Beerus killed Zamasu was a standout exception. In general a lot of the fighting music feels in tune with the corresponding scenes and doesnt get in the way. I just lacks that something special to make it feel unique like the Kikuchi and Faulconer scores as well as the Shuki Levy score and whoever composed the GT Japanese score.The person to whom who I would really compare Sumitomos score is Nathan Johnson for the redub of the first two seasons of the show. Its harmless unobtrusive occasionally inspired but it ultimately does nothing for me. I think Sumitomo is probably more talented than the sum total of his Dragon Ball work would tend to suggest and there are moments that really stand out here and there. Its a shame that Super does not seem to reflect what he is probably capable of doing.,dbz,dakxwvs,1,t5_2sdu8

At least social sciences can go into policy or social work almost directly from college. However the overabundance of undergraduate of communications  people who have no idea what to study go get a comm degree thats the biggest problem degrees especially from tier  and  schools and the lack of skills taught directly in their program is correlated to the underhiring of that department.

10042289,0,t3_5jijjw,Boo is an entity defined by the battle between the good and the evil within him. The evil is the original Boo. The one known as Kid or Pure boo. The good is the Grand Kaioshin. The Grand Kaioshin is seemingly the only entity that had an adverse effect on Boo after being absorbed. Maybe the makeup of Kaio are different and thus react differently when absorbed by Boo than when he absorbs ningen. Maybe the Grand Kaioshin is just of such a pure good that he over wrote the evil in Boo to a certain degree. Maybe all the Kaioshin were just part of him for so long that they were eventually assimilated and they lived on in what we know as Good Boo. Its never really explained but I kinda like that about it.I interpret the battle between Pink and Grey Boo less as an actual battle and more as a metaphysical representation of Boos struggle between his good and evil halves. When Grey Boo wins and absorbs Pink Boo the evil half becomes more dominant but the good half is still present within him. The reason his body changes in the way it does is because of Goku. Goku instilled a desire to fight strong opponents into Boo during their first fight. His new body is thus more accustomed to martial arts. It is only when Good Boo aka Grand Kaioshin is completely separated from his body by Vegeta that he reverts to is pure evil aka original form.At the end of the day Boo is an entity that operates under a lot of unknowns. Sure there are things we can garner about him from how he acts and what Kaioshinsama tells us about him but a lot remains unexplained. Personally I enjoy that kinda vague crap and its one of the things that contributes to Boo being my favorite villain but I understand that not everyone shares that opinion.,dbz,dbgjbig,3,t5_2sdu8

10053740,0,t3_5jo45n,You dont seem to understand how power levels works.                    Forms are not a fix level just like how Gokus SS is equal to Trunks SS            then when Goku transform to SS Trunks powered up his SS to match Gokus SS level                                             When Trunks SS  Gokus SS               they are talking about Goku just transforming to SS and Trunks powering up SS                 SO what happen if Goku powered up SS? Trunks will be outmatched                but instead of doing that as Beerus and Whis stated Goku is immature and just opted to cheat with SSB.                   Another proof of this is Gokus SS is NOT able to beat Buu                but a POWERED UP SS can defeat Buu.              do you get what I am saying?               there are levels to a Transformation.                another thing you seems to not understand                power level is different than fighting skills                    as stated by Vegeta that Black may have Gokus body and all of his power level                      Black is not used to Gokus body still                that is why Vegeta stated that Trunks current level is not enough to beat Black.,dbz,dbi0zhh,2,t5_2sdu8

10098602,0,t3_5kf6qu,Because everything about it was really good on paper but executed so terribly that its dragged down.Baby is arguable at least he had a somewhat solid plan but at the end of the day hes basically a reverse Buu with Freezas grudge against Saiyans.Super  has very few things to be redeemed about him. Its basically the beginning of the Cell Arc all over again...except it takes forever and stops before the actual Cell part. The doctors plan with their super robot must not have involved Goku since they expect him to be trapped in Hell.And the doctors are still treated like trash to the point where the one you actually know is considered helpless against the likes of Pan and her robot with a gun.Super  didnt really have to absorb any attacks from anyone except Goku because they were all ants to him and begging Goku to save them anyway.And then his motives after beating everyone up is...what? Destroy everything? Rule everything? At least  and  had Goku as a goal this guy is just the equivalent of a punching machine that absorbs damage.The worst part is Gokus IQ had to fall into the single digits just for  to defeat Super Saiyan  to begin with. SSJ Goku blasts him doesnt work. Ill use something bigger! Blasts him with Kamehameha doesnt work. Becomes Super Saiyan . Never throws a single punch spends the next  minutes throwing blasts at him. Finally realizes that  is trying to get hit and probably absorbs damage. Uses a full power Kamehameha at Super Saiyan  believing it works...You think Goku in Super was stupid and idiotic? Goku in this arc was exponentially worse and a direct cause for Super  being as strong as he was.And s defeated because he feels the need to absorb all s attacks and is stuck there until Goku punches him because the spirit of the real  lets it happen...OkayThe Shadow Dragon Arc had great premise but was executed terribly.  out of  Dragons are completely forgettable and used as comedy purposes which wouldt be so bad if they didnt have Goku and Pan handle every situation. Have Krillin and Yajirobe fight Haze Shenron because one knows Bora and the other doesnt have a nose resisting the stench of the area. Have Yamcha Puar Bulma and Oolong go after Princess Oceanus no second transformation because of the panty wish. Goten and Trunks fights Rage Shenron Gohan and Pan fights Naturon Shenron absorbs Pan Gohan gets mad etc. etc Goku Vegeta Piccolo if hes still alive fight Nuova and Eis Shenron.

10148563,0,t1_dbtpncn,gt MOVIES gt gt I take the movies as stories in a different dimension from the main story of the comic. Im entirely just an audience member for them.gt gt RoFgt gt As with the last movie I thought up the new story for the next Dragon Ball theatrical film as though it were a continuation of the manga when it was in serialization.gt gt GTgt gt Being a lazy bum by nature I was absurdly happy when I managed to safely finish up Dragon Balls serialization and finally be released from Deadline Hell. The TV anime people wanted to continue for just a little bit more but I just couldnt do any more than that And so I left the Dragon Ball anime completely up to the anime staff story and all. That was Dragon Ball GT.... Dragon Ball GT is a grand sidestory of the original Dragon Ball and itll make me happy for us to watch and enjoy it together.gt gt gt Goku in the Animegt gt  Quote Theres how basically Son Goku from Dragon Ball doesnt fight for the sake of others but because he wants to fight against strong guys. So once Dragon Ball got animated at any rate Ive always been dissatisfied with the righteous herotype portrayal they gave him. I guess I couldnt quite get them to grasp the elements of poison that slip in and out of sight among the shadows.gt gt gt  Quote At any rate I wanted him to have the sense of being that rare guy who seeks only to become stronger than before so much so that it feels like theres no one as pure as this person. And while he does end up saving everyone as a result of that he himself at least has a very pure sincerity about wanting to become stronger. What I wanted to depict the most was the sense that he might not be a good guy at all although he does do good things as a result.What I see here is a clear indication of how Toriyama views the franchise as its author and creator. He refers to the manga many times and considers the movies as taking place separate of the mangas main story. He talks directly about the manga in reference to BoG and RoF being direct continuations of the manga when it was written.That alongside the fact that he nearly outright called the animes portrayal of Goku as being wrong showcases that even more. Its almost obvious that Toriyama himself considers the main real story of the Dragon Ball series to be his manga.Super is where this gets a bit wild because we have interviews like this gt Toyotargt Oh no This whole time I was afraid of adding to your frustrations. Since the original story you give me is text I constantly have your manga by my side as I draw. I dont want readers to say it doesnt feel like Dragon Ball But at the same time I also want to stretch my imagination and come up with brand new action and different kind of expressions.gt gt Toriyamagt Just go wild! I wont mind a bit laughs.Where we have Toei and Toyotaro taking both very different approaches to Toriyamas original text notes and Toriyama himself telling Toyotaro to go wild.Based on all of this I think its fairly safe to say that to Toriyama himself the main Dragon Ball story exists within the original manga written by him and its supplementary mangas like DBM and Jaco that add to the Mangas story and Super exists kind of as a twoway street where both are valid.,dbz,dbuczcz,3,t5_2sdu8

10246413,0,t1_dc5gfgy,gt Geros statement was greatly flawed however. He said because of Gokus age he wouldnt get much stronger from where he was during the Saiyan Saga. Goku was around  years old physically  since he was dead for a year. Gero stopped monitoring Goku around the age of . The physical prime for a normal human is around  years old so Goku was still in his physical prime even by human standards. So Geros statement that Goku was nearing his peak at  makes little sense. It still means though that he calculated Gokus gains based on this premise and that his estimation for Gokus strength was that his overall gains after the battle with Vegeta wouldnt be as major as before. Regardless of whether or not he was right on the matter to assume that Goku wouldnt make as big of increases as before it doesnt change that his calculations for Gokus strength gains  would take this into account. Piccolos gain there is always a strange outlier because we never see an increase that big from him before and we never see one that big after. It can be argued though that there was something other than normal strength there as Piccolo commented about amplifying ki to make it explode and that the energy Piccolo had stolen before meant nothing because of it.,dbz,dc5hkd5,3,t5_2sdu8

10281273,0,t1_dc9cjcc,gt Im not speculating at all. Gokus power was read by raditz scouter and again by Vegetas. In less than a year his power went from  to  which is a twenty times increase. This is by definition a multiplicative increase as his power increased by many multiples. There is no speculation here. Yes it is speculation no matter what you say because as said it can just as easily be an additive situation. Even though the increases did result in him being multiple times stronger the actual gains can just as easily be additive. As such just because Goku jumped to be twenty times stronger doing X amount of training in Y time what Im saying is easily possible and supported in the manga is that the next time he trained in those same conditions and same time he wouldnt get twenty times stronger again. Rather he gained  units the first time which made him roughly x stronger and then would gain  units the second time resulting in only about a doubling of his strength. Then doing the same training for the same amount of time again itd be less of a total gain in comparison to his existing strength.gt This is laughably horrible logic. I legitimately loled upon reading it. There is not set number that the training increases ones power by. It depends on the person the methods etc. So your kicking against the pricks because it wouldnt matter if it was multiplicative or additive in any case goku is going to gain what he gained based on how he trained and the rest will based on how they trained. But Goku clearly gained x his power. Piccolo gained some obscene number greater than that given how Yamcha Chaozu and Tien did much better in a much shorter time than Goku did at kamis it is reasonable to assume the same happened at Kaious. Explained above. No logical way to counter that the way I explained it is just as valid a situation.gt Geros statement merely indicates that he didnt capture the events on Namek and doesnt specify exactly when he stopped. You can easily make that assumption because Gero was watching with the other spy robot when Trunks killed Freeza. Also you can assume that because Gero wouldve known about all of Gokus previous Zenkais and he would definitely be interested in capturing gokus increase in power from the latest one with Vegeta. Remember the whole point of the spying was to SEE HOW STRONG GOKU GOT. It would be foolish for him to have data on the zenkais and to neglect the last most powerful one. Gero wasnt watching when it came to Trunks fight with Freeza. The spybot used for Cell was sent out and conducted by his supercomputer which he set to work on Cell independently while he focused on  and . Thats why he had absolutely no knowledge of the Ssj transformation because he wasnt watching. And yes he would have known about Goku heading to space or about Namek because that was the resounding topic of discussion from the moment of the end of Vegetas battle until he left yet his clear obliviousness to this information shows he didnt keep track.gt Both Piccolo and Vegeta stated that the androids werent as strong as they were led to believe BUT THIS HAS NO BEARING on whether or not they were stronger than Freeza because they were only referring to the fact that they Zsenshi were stronger than the Androids and they were led to believe that wouldnt be the case. Thats not the case at all. Piccolos dialogue in particular offers that their training may have been a factor for why they were doing so much better against  and Gero or that they simply werent as powerful as they were lead to believe. Its clearly an either or not a just because they were so much stronger.gt In fact if the androids were weaker than Freeza than Goku Piccolo or Vegeta would have said something. Furthermore Krillin indicated that Piccolo was as strong as a super saiyan without even being one which means that he was stronger than Freeza at that time. So at the very least the androids would have to be in the realm of freeza but most likely they were stronger since none of the Z fighters said they werent. If they were weaker than freeza they wouldve made mention of it they dont need to be able to sense their power as vegeta shows they can gauge it just from how they fight. All of them have felt freezas ki before at its maximum. For starters none of the humans would have ever sensed Freezas maximum power. They couldnt from Kaious planet or the afterlife and Freeza was stated by Gohan to not be anywhere near his full power when he came to Earth and the shock from the likes of Yamcha at how powerful the suppressed Freeza was supports that  he didnt sense it on Kaious planet. So only Gohan Piccolo and Vegeta would potentially been able to sense Freezas full power but with Piccolo unconscious and Vegeta only being alive for a very brief time before being teleported to Earth that really only leaves Gohan. Kuririns comment wasnt that Piccolo was as strong as a Super Saiyajin either simply that he was stupendously strong especially for not being one. Thats a far cry from saying hes as strong as one.  Piccolo could be  million or so and easily fit that description since to Kuririn that would be stupendously strong and well beyond what he could comprehend someone having without being an Ssj.gt This was clearly a bluff by Gero. Vegeta makes a similar bluff against Android twenty in the very next chapter so theres clear precedence for it. The fact that it is a bluff is shown in the next couple panels where goku is fighting and gero thinks to himself This is impossible well be defeated what should we do? He clearly accurately sensed Gokus power and didnt want his enemies to know he was disadvantaged. Tien stated that the androids talk tough but were not as strong as their words implied. You say that but Geros reaction to Gokus very first attack on  clearly indicates he wasnt actually expecting Goku to be able to do to him what he did. No Geros later comment is clearly one of realization that his initial thoughtstatement was completely wrong rather than confirming that he was lying at the start.gt There is no reason to doubt Geros power scanning abilities. He clearly located the zsenshi based on their sensors  and  confirmed that their sensors accurately read power when they first detected Yamcha. Gero thought it was broken but  confirmed the power reading. There is NO REASON to doubt their scanning technology. Furthermore  presumably with the same scanning technology accurately gauged everyones power except for Cells hidden power. You are grasping at straws. When multiple statements made by Gero based on his power readings are shown to be inaccurate none of which can be verified as bluffs and at least one clearly not being a bluff then its clear that putting a lot of stock in his readings is unreasonable. Its like putting stock in Vegetas multiple boasts over the years about being the strongest or at least more powerful than his enemy when hes been shown time and again to be extremely off base.  has just one reading that has any confirmation to it and the rest were never shown to be true or not so at best those could be considered inconclusive.,dbz,dc9fsry,1,t5_2sdu8

Not everything about him was perfect but the fact that each Buu was like a new villain was fun. Majin Vegeta The greatest writing ever done for a character in the entire franchise. The Great Saiyaman Gohan being a nerdy teen and the second time seeing a person fall in love in a normal way. Fusion Because sharing energy is a cop out SSj Because eyebrows make you weakBad Strong Arm Approach Literally the Gods of Gods solution to an infinitely regenerating piece of gum was to cut it with a sword... or have  kids punch it to death. Too bad there isnt some kind of Evil Containment Wave of some kind to help you nah just punch it. Misplaced Dark Scenes The Majin Buu arc had several times where a kid watching would look in horror to see things that were not okay. Satan getting shot Majin Buu combusting a man. Specifically  episodes of Videl getting tortured but at the same time they still didnt set the mood for the arc very well which made them seem like the writers just needed to let off stress. Main Character Conflictions Goku is a great character for a show like this but too many times they hopped over the fence about who they wanted to be the main character to the point of which Goku was better off dead. Goku being the main character of this arc was fine but unfortunately it cause the issue we have in Super where power is only held by Goku and Vegeta so if something happens to them...Overall Story Sub par outside of Majin Vegeta.Characters Fascinating and enjoyable to see react and do things.Fights Some of Zs best fights.The arc is very good overall just the story has too much scrabbling to really be that good.,dbz,dceaj5v,1,t5_2sdu8

10454961,0,t1_dcstx9z,You seem to think that the Lets not go SSJ during the tournament moment is definitive proof that Beerus was incorrect theres several flaws in this logic. First off this decision was made prior to getting to the arena so Goku isnt present. Hes also never seen being informed of this agreement. Secondly Vegeta has no knowledge of whos going to be entering the tournament. The only participants hes aware of are himself Goku Gohan and the boys this was before they found out about the Junior division. Not to mention by your logic Vegeta shouldnt be agreeing to this in the first place. Under these circumstances Vegeta has a  chance of defeating Goku the only opponent he even cares about at this point. Vegetas witnessed firsthand that Goku has the KaioKen so in a fight without SSJ hes going to come up short no matter what. A much more likely reason as to why Vegeta didnt think twice about the agreement is that hed be the first to break it should it happen to inconvenience him. ,dbz,dct6ady,1,t5_2sdu8

10644872,0,t1_dddkegu,The whole point is he didnt have control over his ki the way adult goku does Kid goku was incredibly strong compared to earthlings from training with his grandpa a student of master roshi. This made his base power strong enough to the point where he could resist bullets but he could not lower his power to the point where bullets could harm him. There is a difference between raw power and ki control as Nappa and Vegeta had way more raw power than the z fighters but they did not have their level of ki control as seen by their innability to sense raise lower ki.

It would also be very very fun if the Universe Survival Arc isnt fully selfcontained and instead kicks off a new even more epic and dangerous storyperhaps to restore the destroyed Universe  amongst others.

10690382,0,t1_ddiky48,Yes .But now on a more serious note. This is the same exact order I have even if putting Buu above Piccolo makes me sad.

10693635,0,t1_ddinf4v,gt I thought Zamasu calling everything nonGod a human was a mistranslation. If you meant Zamasu feels humanity need to be controlled as Zamasu feels mortals need to be controllednot just the humans on Earth then I get you.From the quick google search I did I found that Japanese does not have a word for mortals and the word they used that the sub versions translated as humans could also mean mortals. And since Zamasu was shown to despise all nongod creatures I think he is referring to all mortals.gt I actually forgot about Gohan still being alive when Chi Chi was pregnant. Yeah Goku wouldnt be checking on but I assumed Gohan would. Which brings another plot point. Gohan would likely stick by his pregnants mother side and Zamasu would have to kill him.Tbh I forgot that too. But Gohan was pretty busy training Trunks and fighting androids at the time. And Chichi was presumably killed before Gohan as she is nowhere in the story so this means he failed to protect her.That being said even if Gohan was at her bedside this is afterCell saga Gohan who doesnt know what a kaioshin even is. He wouldnt be able to recognize a god and probably not even feel his ki and after being killed he would just know that some dude killed him and Chi chi he wouldnt have the knowledge to say that it was a kai.gt They still have their differences. As you said Goten isnt socially inept in Zs epilogue we see he slacked off on training and like we saw in the training for the fusion dance hes a lot more self conscious. I feel theres enough difference to give Goten his own special skill instead of inheriting Gokus fighting skills. Maybe he could be super competent at Ki control. He already is the youngest Super Saiyan and Gotenks mastery of SS could come from Goten so the basis is there for Goten to be a natural at handling Ki. Which would nicely tie up with how much Whis has to stress it and push Goku and Vegeta to be better at it.Zs epilogue is most likely already retconned as a lot of things dont make sense in it and it was just a nice way to end it. If they go on with the story for long with Super I think it is likely that they will have Goten and Trunks developing like fighters as hinted in the latest ep. Of course there is no way to be sure.And the thing with Dragon Ball is everyone changes because of their surroundings. Piccolo a child of a being that was pure evil sacrificed his life for the son of his biggest enemy. Vegeta a massive murderer became a loving father and husband. DB ignores the psychology theory that a lot of our innergoodness is already decided with our birth and just goes with the theory that it is decided by the way we are brought up and even takes it into adulthood. So it would make sense that a Goten that is raised as a saiyan would turn out a lot different than a Goten that is raised as a human. We could debate what Goten should be when he is grown up but that is just our opinions. They could easily make F. Goten grow up to be just like evil Goku and contradict nothing in canon and I would like it but I do understand it if you want to see Goten to grow up and be a totally different person.I absolutely hated how Goten looked like as a teenager and nothing like Goku while a lot of people loved it so it is the matter of our opinions. Thanks for the insights though!,dbz,ddiywgu,1,t5_2sdu8

Current Gohan is the only one who has deserved the anger power ups legit as hes not a fighter and getting mad helps tap into his full potential which is what Z has been about.

10753092,0,t3_5ttbok,SSGs multiplier is definitely in the billions to trillions depending on how large the universe actually is.  SSB is at least x stronger than SSG. In the manga it was stated that since Vegeta used Blue twice in a row he wasnt able to exert th of his power and thus was stomped by Hit. However Gokus Red God Form was able to shit all over Hit. So this means that True Power Blue must be several times stronger than True Power Red.  Dont expect much of an explaination for multipliers. We still have no idea how strong Super Saiyan Rose and Rage are.  Super Saiyan Rose is more than likely just a superior more efficient and complex version of SSB while Super Saiyan Rage is probably like SSJ to SSJ with Super Saiyan Rage being twice as strong as SSB if we follow the logic of SS.

10785859,0,t3_5u9avn,Mr. Satan and Muten Roshi disagree with you. But for real the reason is probably  fold Japanese individuals often do not grow much facial hair. So Toriyama likely just didnt even think about it initially. Roshi is a bit of an exception because traditionally martial arts masters have long beards.  If the main younger characters had more facial hair it would be black. This would require more inking which is both expensive and time consuming. The reason Super Saiyan has gold hair is because Toriyama wanted to reduce inking time cutting a few corners to get  chapters to Shueisha faster. ,dbz,ddshegt,8,t5_2sdu8

11037888,0,t3_5xlxm9,Ill try to answer as best I can.Dragon Ball amp Dragon Ball Z are  in the same universe its all one story written in the manga by Akira Toriyama into an anime by Toei Animation. After that point you run into...complications. There are movies in DB and DBZ created by Toei Animation that take place in the rough vicinity of certain events but were not directly meant to take place in the same universe. Alternate sidestories if you would. HOWEVER there are two movies mainly Battle of Gods and Resurrection F that Toriyama did play a fairly large hand in and were meant to take place within the last section of Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball GT is a series created by Toei Animation continuing after DBZ and creating its own story. Dragon Ball Super is a direct sequel to the Dragon Ball Z anime based on a plot outlined by Akira Toriyama. It starts out with those same two different movies mentioned above and continues on into its own story. A monthly manga adaptation drawn by artist Toyotar is featured in the Japanese magazine VJump.People still tend to be surprised when they see superhuman powers simply because the chances of meeting a planet destroyer is obviously rare especially when some look like you. So while they definitely are more surprised its not an impossibility.The general population still believe Mr. Satan defeated Cell but a select few know otherwise the ones who were there and those directly acquainted with the main castMr. Satan is his stage name his real name is Mark this is a pun on akumaYes time travel is involved in the series.Dragon Ball is a shnen manga written by Akira Toriyama. Loosely based on Journey to the West it follows a boy named Son Goku from childhood to adulthood as he trains himself in martial arts with the goal of growing stronger. Throughout his adventures he and his friends search for seven magical Dragon Balls that when gathered together can grant a single wish.gt I just watched an episode on toonami of dragon ball super where goku became a literal god and then looked it up and found that later he apparently gets blue hair and becomes x stronger than his god form. Was this generally well received by fans? It just seems like a pretty absurd power spike to elevate goku to godhood unless being a god has less meaning in universe.Ehhh......Well first things first. God is a title and not all Gods are unbelievably strong. There is a God of Earth Lord of Worlds Lord of Lords Gods of Destruction...theres a lot.So strictly being a God isnt that big a deal but the big deal is that he became a god with the power to rival a God of Destruction who has a lot of power for the purposes of...destroying.gt In that same episode a point is made that they need another Saiyan to godify goku and the guy with  eyes is there Tien I think is his name? is he not a Saiyan? I thought he was first introduced as vegetas henchman so I always assumed he was a saiyan. What is he?Tien is not a Saiyan but I know youre confusing him for Nappa who is a Saiyan and was paired with Vegeta. Tien was introduced in Dragon Ball as an Earthling.,dbz,dej4isp,4,t5_2sdu8

11053016,0,t3_5xszfi,Im not sure why everyone is telling you no. This is more or less the explanation of god ki were given in the series. Whis trains them to not leak their ki which naturally compresses it. Both Trunks and U Supreme Kai note the incredible pressure when first witnessing SSB and that is due to how compressed their ki is. Instead of gauging their power by the power output ki leakage god ki power levels go by the amount of pressure one gives off how compressed their ki is more or less. As for the ritual I guess thats how it worked. With all their ki forced into him it forced him to compress it all and when he lost the form but seemed to retain the power that because Gokus body remembered the feeling of compressing ki even after losing the form. He just couldnt compressmanipulate his ki well enough yet which is why he was regular SS against Beerus instead of Blue,dbz,deku9lg,12,t5_2sdu8

Sounds like grace to me.If they were all going to be destroyed anyway it doesnt really matter when they were destroyed in the mortal scope.

Androids kill everyone Trunks goes to timeline  finds blueprints comes back and deactivates Androids Cell kills him goes to timeline . Timeline  future trunks arrives to save Goku from heart disease. Cell never appears. Androids kill everyone Trunks goes to timeline  Krillin doesnt deactivate  and Cell becomes perfect everyone trains hard and Trunks is more than strong enough to take out imperfect cell once hes back home. Timeline  Trunks and Timeline  Cell BOTH arrive hereAlso would Babidi ever find the energy to resurrect Buu? In timeline  the Earth has all of the strongest characters the entire universes energy would be needed for Babidi to have a chance at reviving Buu. His only hope is that Sorbet eventually finds New Namek and wishes Frieza back.Im more concerned for Timeline . If they deactivated the Androids and Cell never showed up FPSSJ and SSJ were probably discovered really late if at all. And since Goku only got SSJ and Metamoran fusion in the Otherworld its fairly unlikely that hed ever figure those out on earth.

Sure he was a dick but he reveled in it and had a lot of fun with it at least.Lack of internal conflict is exactly Super Gokus problem. Before he had genuine conflict between his love for battle and desire to do the right thing. Now hes entirely the former to the exclusion of any consideration of the latter and his characters actually been obscenely dumbed down by this series so far. Hes a joke at best and an insult at worst.Z Goku was one of my favorite characters but I honestly hope Super Goku ends up being a villain at this point.

As far as Toppo goes yes it was absolutely needed to be able to fight him but from a writing standpoint why add in Goku fighting this legendary dude that is possibly equal to SSB kaioken and introducing an even greater threat if Goku wasnt going to surpass it somehow. A lot of people have also been using the statement Ill show what its like to surpass my limits as proof as well but honestly that could easily be attributed to Goku deciding to fuck himself up with multipliers again because he got too excited rather than a new form entirely. ,dbz,df8yywx,2,t5_2sdu8

Also as I said before being as fast as the speed of ligh in that point would change the context of the narrative in a negative way if Andriod  and Andriod  where FTL it would have take them no effort to escape from Cell considering that they dont have Ki to be detected I also remember that Gohan said that it take him around  minutes to go to school maybe Gohan is not as strong as he used to be at the point of the Cell games and even if he not going full power he is definitely beyond Burter. It also take Frieza some minutes to return to his space ship after his fight with Nail and at that point he was really angry being FTL would take him less then a second to get there.If anything Im said is wrong correct me please my memory doesnt always keep up with the little details.,dbz,dfdtae0,1,t5_2sdu8

Meanwhile Vegeta is still waiting patiently for the birth as Bulma uses his training room to do some exercises to help the birth go along smoothly. Bulma apologizes for holding up his training and while he makes a big show of being annoyed Goten can tell hes really looking forward to the birth.

Kaioshins not sure since hes never investigated planets from a strength perspective beforewhich is apparently one reason their universe is ranked so low. Whis says since they dont know about other planets they should focus on Earth. First theyve got the three who entered the exhibition match Goku Gohan and Buu. Goku says Monaka should enter but Beerus claims Monakas health isnt so good right now. Oh wellThen theres Piccolo and Kuririn. Gohan wonders if Kuririns up to the task but Goku insists hell be fine since theyve still got time to train and Kuririn has moves Gohan doesnt know about. On the flipside Goku thinks Goten and Trunks arent suited for the tournament despite their power theyre too straightforward and lack experience so theyd probably end up losing by ringout.In that case Gohan suggests Roshi hes got plenty of experience and some tricky moves. Now theyve got seven! Next they consider Androids  and . Kaioshin wonders if androids are OK for the tournament but Gohan and Goku think theyll be fine since theyre really just restructured humans. Theyll just have to ask  where  is now. That leaves one more! Kaioshin goes off to check other planets for candidates and asks Goku and co. not to eat too much in the meantime. Gohan wants to go get some Senzu from Karin but Whis assumes those will probably be against the rules. Beerus thinks they could try eating them in secret but if they got caught theyd be doomed. Vegeta is pacing around considering names for the baby Eschalot? Not bad and Goku and Gohan explain to him about the tournament. There are all sorts of strong guys in the other universes. Why Goku says hes not sure if he couldve beat Us Toppo even with Super Saiyan Blue! And therell be a total of  contestants fighting all at once! But Vegeta still refuses. He wont budge until the babys born! Beerus flatout orders him to enter but he refuses unless they convince Bulma first. With that Whis promptly goes to Bulma and uses his staff and some magic words to have Bulmas child immediately materialize in her arms. There now Vegeta can enter!Everyone celebrates the babys birth. Goku doesnt think the baby resembles Vegeta but Bulmas mother disagrees saying that she has Vegetas forehead. Everyone takes turns passing the baby around making Vegeta increasingly mad. Even Yamcha stops by to see the newborn!Meanwhile Trunks and Goten are still getting the cradle ready though Trunks has trouble deciding exactly where in the room to place it. Gohan comes in and congratulates Trunks on becoming a big brotherthough he forgot to ask if the new baby is a boy or girl. Goten hopes its a boy so that Trunks can train with him just as he and Gohan did. But if its a girl itll be cute like Pan!Trunks goes out to meet his new sibling and finds out its a girl. Bulma has Trunks hold the baby and though hes initially reluctant he soon takes to it. But Vegeta scolds him for holding the baby wrong. Apparently Vegeta is a real expert at this now. Dr. Briefs asks Bulma is shes thought of a name for the baby yet. If not he has one in mind! Vegeta freaks out since hes already picked a suitably Saiyan name for the childbut in fact Bulma herself has already named her Bra! Though Vegeta is taken aback everyone else likes this name. Its cute!Now Goku and the others have one more thing to protect. Theyve got to win the tournament! Goku goes off to recruit Kuririn and Gohan promises to follow him shortly. Yamcha has overheard about the tournament of power and wonders if the winning team will get a wish granted like last time. If its a tenperson team Yamcha figures hes got a good chance of being asked to join. Hell just have to wait!Vegeta continues to hold his baby. Bra huh? Hmph not a bad name,dbz,dfexavx,1,t5_2sdu8

Mr Popos official powerlevel during DB was never given but we can infer that it is less than  since that was Piccolos at the start of DBZ. Goku during his fight with Piccolo was . Even if we say Mr Popo is  the difference between them is less than . Also anything beyond a .x difference is pretty much death. .x difference resulted in Dodoria getting played with by Vegeta. .x difference and Cui got oneshotted by Vegeta.Its downright ridiculous to have Mr Popo anywhere close to ten times stronger. Goku also didnt know the true extent of Friezas power all he knew was that Frieza was more than twice as strong as him since Vegeta was stronger than a nonKaioken Goku on Earth.

But  in the other hand only partially got over his order by making Cell his main target.  Given that  might have a different status towards his old programing altogether. Just speculating of course but It would give his episode more intrigue than a simple sparring match.,dbz,dfx0sh4,2,t5_2sdu8

Even the distinction between wave and blast is vague as sometimes the kamehameha is portrayed as a continuous beam of energy and other times like a ball that is lobbed.I think in the end a lot of our ideas regarding the properties of different attacks comes from the video games which want to differentiate the characters to make a more satisfying game.

11501083,0,t3_643cee,my head cannon is like this....normal ki  the lame version of the original ki created by the gods the reason many people is able to sense it is most likely due the excessive amounts leaked outside the body the reason this ki was created is most likely because gods failed to pass on the right knowledge as you can see there are universes with gods working side by side with humans.god ki  the ki used by the gods its the right version and the only that should exist the proper one so why people is not able to sense it? because this proper version is all about raise your power within your body inside... not leaking ki outside the body. is not that people cant sense it its there but harder to sense.so in theory every being could use god ki if they were to undergo training now about Krillin I dont think we should dwell into it god ki creates a big pressure that can be sensed regardless if you have god ki or not its the special feature from god ki like when you press something so deep it just creates pressure because it wants to break free.ill give you an example with IRL terms.god ki is like a white dwarf star while its volume can be that from a small planet  such as our Earth  its mass can be compared to the size of our sun  for example SSJSSJ .heres a picture so you can understand why is it too hard to sense god ki,dbz,dfznbsr,2,t5_2sdu8

Its a weird goo its obviously got some form of power beyond a simple copy since weak being were searching for it to become stronger was that not the point of the miniarc?Aside from that being a made up theory with no basis. Goku literally fights even with it not  seconds after Gotenks gets whooped. Thats your measure of scale right there.gt And Skinny Buu  gave Goku an asswhooping. Maybe the others didnt but Buu caught Goku offguard and won in a nonfight to the death.The jury is still out on Buu.

I expected so much from it because fans are always saying Just wait until you get to the Piccolo Daimao arc or Dragon Ball only gets good until the Piccolo Daimao arc. stuff like that.gt Krillin Roshi and Chiaotzu Each and every one of their deaths felt very real to me. Krillin and Roshi have been with me on this journey for a long time and just having them dead with the possibility of the dragon balls never working again kills me inside. I just hope the dragon balls can be revived. PS Chiaotzu can stay dead for all I care with his million yard stare.I feel you.  The moment were Goku starts running towards Kuririn gave me goosebumps.  You could definitely feel that someting really bad was going to happen.  I actually teared up when Goku finds Kuririn dead and goes on a rampage.  The Turtle Hermits death was also impactful.  The small speech he gave about how someoneGoku will eventually defeat him just before he died also gave me goosebumps.  Didnt care much for Chaozu though.The next arc is one my favorites.

Thats a lot of story to cover.If you really want to I guess you could look up a summary on the Dragon Ball wiki or some other site. I wouldnt recommend that though. If youre dead set on skipping as much as possible at least only skip the Universe  tournament arc.Anyway keep in mind that theres only one episode a week. Do you really want to be caught up as fast as possible? One episode a week means that things feel really slow for people who are caught up. Just watch whats available at your own pace.Alternatively you could just watch the English dub which is very far behind the Japanese version and is only coming out at a rate of one episode each week.

11806164,0,t1_dgy92mu,IIRC It was scaled seeing as Vegeta at the same time was capable of singlehandedly easily destroying an entire planet especially considering how easy it was to him Meaning that if stretched to the limit  it would make sense if Raditz could at least do some planetary damage.That sounds a lot like Naruto who cant possibly destroy an entire planet  but can definitely cause damage.,dbz,dgy9pl1,17,t5_2sdu8

11807042,0,t3_68gyq1,gt After watching ep  again but this time in dub it hit me how Whis wanted Vegeta to eventually become a God of Destruction. I think thats why he actually agrees to train him He didnt actually want Vegeta to become one. The wording used in the original Japanese version indicates that what he was saying to Vegeta wasnt that hed be willing to train Vegeta if Vegeta agreed to become a Hakaishin but rather that he would only train Vegeta if Vegeta were to become a Hakaishin first. Essentially Whis is saying that he under normal circumstances only trains Hakaishin and thats what his ultimatum was to Vegeta. He wasnt making Vegeta an offer to agree on but rather a statement of what Vegeta would have to do before hed normally have even considered training him.,dbz,dgydajn,10,t5_2sdu8
