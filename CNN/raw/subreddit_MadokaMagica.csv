783909,0,t1_cgt64ab,I dont know if just holding Madokas hand was enough for Homura to break her off though. In that case any magical girl could have done it if theyd thought of it and Im pretty sure Madoka just teleports to each place shes needed so I dont think it was the hand grabbing itself that caused her to split. Also I dont think Madokas wish directly caused Homuras soul gem to change color. Rather I dont think Homuras plan would have worked if it was not compliant with Madokas wish but it was still Homuras own feelings that changed the color of her soul gem. As she said that emotion was unique to her. The reason her soul gem suddenly changed colors at that moment I think was because Homura gave in and accepted the full consequences of what her love would require her to do. Madokas wish filling Homuras soul gem could work but thats more complicated than it needs to be. The rest of the theory could work though. ,MadokaMagica,cgtduc6,3,t5_2w9u6

876594,0,t1_ch0p5eu,gtLeast FavoriteKyuubeys explanation of their motivations. The idea that magical girls are perpetual motion machines was brilliant and strangely amusing. But I have a lot of minor nitpicks for the rest. E.g. He expresses befuddlement at how humans feels tricked and deflects the fault back to the humans for making their wishes in the first place. It didnt seem fitting for an emotionless race presumably driven by logic. A decision made under conditions of ignorance is logically suboptimal to say the least. And without the Incubators the Wish wouldnt have been possible so the deflection of guilt doesnt seem in character either.I felt the opposite. That was one of my favorite parts of the show.,MadokaMagica,ch3x83l,1,t5_2w9u6
919438,0,t1_ch8shrk,It... Would appear not. In the universe that she made the only Incubator left was that pitiful tortured soul you see at the end so its highly likely that none of that stuff ever happened. Kyouko and Mami certainly arent if memory serves Nagisa either. Madoka obviously isnt. Of course there is an exception which is undoubtedly Sayaka. As an emissary from Madoka Nagisa and Sayaka gained a lot of powers including a control over both their human and Witch forms simultaneously. Given that she was young it was apparently quite easy to brainwash Nagisa. Sayaka however survived the universal restructuring entirely unscathed and its mentioned that she doesnt ever lose those powers. This makes her and Homura the only Magical girls in the universe aside from Madoka. But Homura makes both of them forget Though I personally feel that sayaka still didnt forget.To be honest all I can say is this Not lost only forgotten... What has been lost cannot be found but what has been forgotten can be retrieved...EDIT As kindly pointed out to me by user iMew Kyouko and Mami are still Magical girls and Wraiths still exist in Homuras remade universe.

1780620,0,t3_2evb6y,To be quite honest I cant think of many wishes that anyone would take if they knew the consequences of said wish. Yes there are those wishes that are on such a global scale that the more selfless among us would be able to sacrifice themselves for but most of those are beyond the Karmic Destiny of any one human. By this I mean stuff like Ending world hunger or any variation on the Salvation wishes that Madoka could have chosen.And then the wishes of those that have come before me Like giving Incubators emotion for instance would make very little difference. I mean yes they would no longer depend on us for a fuel source and would be able to use their own kind for the same effect but anyone that was a Magical girl before IE you would still be a Magical girl and without a supply of Magical girls falling into despair to become the Witches you need to kill to stay alive you will soon fall into despair and if youre very good at your job you may find yourself as one of the last Magical girls left which means youll be a Witch for all eternity preying on mankind forever with your invulnerability. And that said even if you could sum up the power to do some serious good for the world like abolishing corruption or poverty or prejudice what would the backlash be? I mean as we all know for every shred of hope that a wish brings into the world it must be balanced out by despair. Any worldchanging wish would have disastrous consequences on a global scale in one horribly ironic way or another.All of this tells me that if I were to be approached by an Incubator I likely wouldnt be able to make a wish unless I was ignorant of the things I now know.That said a few years ago I would have sacrificed anything for a wish I had to be granted. But now... I just dont know if anything my Karmic Destiny could do that would be worth the inevitable sacrifice of my life.,MadokaMagica,ck3lno7,5,t5_2w9u6

1880365,0,t3_2g3210,I...OK Ill be honest I didnt really appreciate Madoka Magica as much the first time I watched it partly because I was a shit back when I first watched it.  I thought it was good and all but until I watched it a second time I dont feel I liked it all that much.I thought the Rebellion Story was to slow at the beginning especially since it was obvious that it was going to go full sadness at some point Watching it after marathoning the movies a few weeks after marathoning the show made it so much better. I liked it though despite the fact that it was clearly unnecessary but it made sense in the context of the movies kinda I think. I hope they find some way to tie the whole thing together without just running in the room and yelling despair a whole bunch. It was a bit unsatisfying that they didnt have a teaser for a sequel or something though although its obvious that theyre going to do something with it now because money.Art and music are always the best.,MadokaMagica,ckfrzdt,1,t5_2w9u6

2460318,0,t3_2npzon,So this was the living sister right? If she was dead I would probably go with yes on being a magical girl. Then she could be the friend that got killed in front of her which would work nicely. But if she is alive and is a magical girl it would most likelly be as a form of support to the character gt less suffering. Which might also have its use in story telling since constant suffering loses its charm I guess. Which is explained pretty well by Caster in FateZero in that the greatest terror is found just after hope turns to despair.The other alternative is that the magical sister would feud with the main character though that seems kind of unlikelly given the circumstances.So if she isnt the friend she lost then its probably best if she is just a normal person not able to understand what her sister is going through which further alienates her from everything else and makes her isolated in her misery.Btw what is the idea after the character is created. Place it in the madoka magica universe and make up a story or idk? Still fun though regardless of the end goal. Just that the end goal might effect what I would choose.Think Ill wait until tomorrow to choose something getting kind of late.,MadokaMagica,cmfspb9,2,t5_2w9u6

Quite confusing and dangerous compared to the weeks in the past.ugfdt and his many clones such as gfdtishavinginternetproblems duked it out in a v bracket tournament to find out who is the one true gfdt. Then we found out none of them was the real gfdt as Xcibbles won the tournament due to his huge muscles he gained from lifting elephants.Artydath was also banned this week from the entire IRC network for being too awesome or not liking best girl I forget which. Luckily his ban was resolved due to SSB bribing the admins with uwikingwarrior s drunken fanfics.ulifebaka has opened a bar in the IRC! Offering many different drinks such as cuposlime goop or cream le kyubbey. The business is expected to develop well into the future.Sakori has successfully summoned the demon of sleep from his newly constructed patio. He has been sleeping a whole lot more and thats pretty much it sleep demons just kinda sleep.Lastly SBB has developed a master plan for us all that will cause the next stage in human evolution to begin. I am greatly excited for my new teleportation powers even if SBB keeps saying its just a better magical burst and that I wont be able to teleport.Also umothership has joined the weekly magical burst as a rock.BE SURE TO JOIN US IN THE IRC FOR MORE FUN AND EXCITEMENT!!Normally I would link the IRC here but seriously I am on mobile and its in the freakin side bar just go look at the sidebar LOOK AT IT,MadokaMagica,d14wxvt,3,t5_2w9u6

Edit  Note that I did not expect to see Hillary Clinton in this video when I looked it up but people have been suspecting for a while that Soros is behind Hillary.  Theres also evidence via wikileaks that her campaign chairman John Podesta was in contact with Soros.  Also while the term globalist may be new to you it has actually been around for quite some time.  Until recently though people were just dismissing it as crazy conspiracy theory stuff.  It would seem that the Podesta emails uncovered a deep rabbit hole indeed.,MadokaMagica,da0vp4s,-1,t5_2w9u6

In particular you can see that the Anthonies those little cotton ball familiars were showing signs of being under the influence of Sayakas magic because they had mermaid tails which is something that was mentioned in the extras booklet that came with the collectors edition of Rebellion.Youll have to clarify what you mean by Homura and Charlotte contacting Madoka because Im not sure what youre referring to.,MadokaMagica,dapsl2o,1,t5_2w9u6

9930581,0,t3_5hpr2y,Something that revolves around horrific creatures that were once men and animals born from profane magic which is spread by a shining wishmaking innocentlooking entity who comes at people at their weakest moment. The only way to kill said monsters is to use said magic which will end up transforming YOU into a monster eventually for others to kill in an endless cycle. Souls despair and hope are all central to the story as despair is what triggers the transformation from man to beast. The main storyline also involves a relationship between two sorcerers one of which locks himself into an endless loop in order to save his dear friend. What am I talking about here the game Soul Sacrifice or Madoka Magica?,MadokaMagica,db1zad9,2,t5_2w9u6
9955191,0,t1_db44xve,This explains a lot thx!But I think its even worse... Is it in the PSPortableVita iteration? Where Sayaka really is able to well make a contract with Kyou? He will witness her witchery as far as I know and of course go like apeshit...so yep Another contract that gloriously fails right? In the anime it seemed to me as if Sayaka wanted to either confess her true feelings to Kyou  or to end the relationship If she called it that way however I guess Kyou would yet again have a reason to go mad WTF THERE NEVER WAS RELATIONSHIP YOU ROTTEN CLINGING MONSTER!! YOU BOTH ARE CLINGING TO ME FOR YEARS NOW...  Ill explain later the upper post already did partially But for now Sayaka is still before Kyous property....and along comes Cherry and starts explaining her Elfenlied method LOL Of course Sayaka is letting go of Kyou and getting started on Kyoko... I think QB persuaded Kyoko....maybe even like later Sayaka and Madoka if you know what I mean... Therefore Hitty is now the only remaining contestant so to speak. Its neither her fault nor its even her deed and feat...So how the h could we consider her responsible  at all?Even worse She gave Sayaka an extra day....would Sayaka have been doing the same honestly? That you are mine mine mine Sayaka?And that I have no long range weapons Sayaka? She indeed can throw her swords  but shes lying to Hommy for Hommy came foo close to Maddy. Shes clinging to Madoka incredibly hence the you are mine scene. And we see Sayaka isnt really good at respecting the personal borders of others! Kyou wanna get rid of her but he cant say no....until its too much for him and his no is gonna be the broken CD.... not an excuse only an explanation! Hitomi...unfortunately the same. She calls him in the middle of the night wont we forget! Again he is not able to say no. Yet again a bad excuse is drawn.But  why is Hitty doing this? Well its due to her strict Mom I guess! I must do ballet and piano despite the upcoming exams... So Hitty must do her phone calls secretly right. Another hint Hitomi behind the curtain on stage...why not waiting before the door outside? Ok she wanna see and hear him play the violin...but then why not trying to get the allowance to have a seat regularly? Did the judges refuse?Or...does she rather wanna be certain that no one sees her...in order to make no one tell this her Mom? We also understand now some actions of Homuras. When Sayaka refuses Homuras help and even kicks away the grievy  Hommy is exercising no emergency killing let alone a mercy killing. Its an act of punishment for inobedience and a payback...for Sayakas I have no long range armory made Homura collect heavier stuff and heavier despair literally. And of course the infamous Akuma regulations Homura who now can manipulate free will Leave Maddy alone!  and all of them obey instantaneously! made Hittys Mom permit the relationship. So Hitty and Kyou are now walking around officially. Sayaka however...well She has now Kyoko the Cherry Blossom the first shot of the Homuverse...and Homulilys brain if you remember all this. After Madokami saved her Homura simply needed an alternative also called plan b And spread at Rebbys beginning we saw Sayaka is not able to catch Kyoko as easily as Madoka! Big Mama Homura thus is acting pretty educational aint she! XDAll in all Imho there is no reason to hate Hitomi. Think about it No one of the others is that honest... You are now involved like it or not... Sry I did have one grievy left... I mean...srsly oO,MadokaMagica,db56pyx,1,t5_2w9u6

10406331,0,t1_dcnmih5,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,MadokaMagica,dcnmill,2,t5_2w9u6

10701792,0,t3_5t1oo8,Madoka sacrifices herself actually only for herself tho it looks like the opposite!Homura sacrifices herself for all the others tho it looks like the opposite!Maddy wanted to get her a off that awful scenery.In the first timeline on the stairs when Walpy arrived she already was a MG when her Mom came to her. Her Mom was a target of the Incubators but somehow could escape. This is why she so quickly answered Maddys question about what she would do with magic. She wanted to get it done but then fell into despair...And now she only could tell Madoka the truth How does a gem work who is Walpy how to beat her Targetting a precise shot after comforting her....then Junko said sry and ran away like Sayaka in that Dont follow me sequence...Madoka killed Walpy...and then smushed her gem intentionally. Junkos talk was simply too much for her. Her hand now was empty it never was after this. Cause Homura monitored this.She didnt even allow Madoka to die!!Madoka finds out in the final timeline our TV show!!When Homura was maximum defenseless after again failing at beating Walp and after QB told her the mechanicals You are Center of Karmic Destiny from  timelines then she new Homura IS that Karmic destiny and Homura is so focussed on Madoka that Madoka is connected to her and now she uses that connection as a rope to pull away Homura salary from those many timelines!She speaks out her wish and now is in space and heaven  Homura too she was the aircraft so to speak!Actually she didnt want this She wanted to get rid of any magic so she wouldnt have to die and no QBs and MGs could threat her!Madoka made a mistake however She phrased it incorrectly. I rescue witches when they are born! Now she rescues them exactly within the mutation and is immortal. Now she must recruit as many of them still existing girls in order to handle a still overmighty Homura.Homura is angry too she tells the Incubator who actually forgot like after each time reset everything he has to know about the old ways. Hes gettn terminally angry and decides....All in all Madoka wanted to save herself  saving the others would have been a side effect!And it turned out to be Shtty lives still going on Kyoko was still a drifter and Mami still an orphan right? And Madoka only comes afterwardsHomura corrects this In her world magic is blocked from scratch Kyoko and Mami and all of them have a peaceful home...except for Hommy and a starving QB...and a decaying cosmos...,MadokaMagica,ddjt6nk,2,t5_2w9u6
10733949,0,t3_5tcnlr,Same reason Kyubey didnt contract Hitomi because theres a strategy behind it.Rather than going with everyone elses claim that girls are more emotional than boys Im going to make the argument that human society promotes that girls should be more outwardly emotional than boys. What this means is that if you stuff six magical boys into a room they are pressed by societal norms to keep to themselves and stew. With the girls on the other hand societal norms press them into a very explicit drama contestBasically Kyubey is using human societal norms against it human culture has made girls easier targets and the socialemotional element means that theyd likely be faster to turn.In other words why put seven days of effort into a group of boys when you can put half the amount of effort into a group of girls and get the same results?,MadokaMagica,ddn4k72,3,t5_2w9u6

Yeah word usage is very important because theres a lot of philosophy  stuff going on in the series.Overall youre  correct theres no good bad hero or villain in those traditional terms. Madoka is the closet thing to good and she ultimately falls short rather she just makes the world a slightly better place.One part I think we can take significant agreement is on how great Kyouko is. I honestly wonder if the people who think she contributes nothing to the plot would have been happy with  episodes straight of Sayaka insufferable character being shoved in our face. Kyouko showed us what being a magical girl was truly about while also reminding the viewer that dying with your ideals in your heart is better than succumbing to apathy and cynicism.,MadokaMagica,dfjg48s,4,t5_2w9u6

However to me a manga like this one still shows events that may have certainly happened during a time loop...As much as I really enjoyed Homura Tamura its really hard to consider most of the loops as canon...
