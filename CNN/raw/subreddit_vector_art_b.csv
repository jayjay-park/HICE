10721538,0,t3_5rlcb6,Im assuming you used Adobe Illustrator to make the icon. There are two ways most icons are saved PNG or SVG. When youre done with the file and export it select PNG as the format and check the box marked Use Artboards  this will include the empty space surrounding your icon on the artboard in your final file. Hit OK and then a box will pop up offering the option of a transparent background or a white background. Select the transparent background and then export and thats it.For SVG Just make sure that your icon is the only thing on the artboard like dont have a big white rectangle behind it on the canvas and just export in SVG format and thats all. ,vector_art_b,ddluilw,1,t5_2r2n4
