2408024,0,t3_2n0xfd,TAS can also stand for Tool Assisted Superplay.  Still the generally accepted rule with TASes is that they should complete the whole game by some definition of complete.Maybe youd be interested in checking out the TASvideos forums?  Lots of people post proof of concepts and WIPs work in progress which kinda fit your definition.,TAS,cm9c9wv,2,t5_2s55m
4040513,0,t1_crgsjsw,in the speedrunning community we call a theory TAS a TAS that is only doing things that are humanly possible.so basicially its just what a perfect speedrun by a human would look like. if the TAS would be optimized,TAS,crgukrf,2,t5_2s55m

11707203,0,t3_671rqy,If I remember them commenting it had to do with how difficult its been to come up with a unique and impactful TAS showcasing something interesting every six months.That coupled with the fact that the past few have been a lot of and from here we broke the game we we programmed it to do anything which is very impressive its just gotten kinda stale. The last one I was significantly impressed with was the finding button combinations that could beat all the Marios so I think theyre just trying to prevent it from getting dull and making sure they do something creative the next time. ,TAS,dgn1i41,24,t5_2s55m
11707264,0,t1_dgn1i41,I think people have way too high expectations. I found the majority of the TAS stuff very entertaining and they always do something new. Meanwhile we have games that return almost every time that are mostly the same such as Metroid Prime  which was not really all that interesting last time because it was pretty much the exact same run as the time before that. There are many other examples but thats a run I didnt really watch since I saw his previous run of it and felt that was enough.,TAS,dgn1r2k,7,t5_2s55m
