6992069,0,t3_4b8pz5,The problem is that Lifton didnt really bring the idea of brainwashing to cults. This was the work of Margaret Singer amongst others who were integral parts of the anticult movement notably CAN.To make the assumption that what Lifton is describing and applying it to religious groups is a a bit of a leap and original research. The alternative though is to quote people with strong ties to the anticult movement hardly a unbiased source.,cults,d18w6fg,1,t5_2qzdi

8141766,0,t1_d4u7mj1,Well. My own view is indeed of something of a ship of fools but I think the problems are far more profound than predictable no offense remonstrations of food crisis or war. Briefly food shortage per population growth is questionable a vast surfeit of food production globally is apparently wasted to considerable irony and perhaps no surprise in such a globally inefficient model. The subject is ideological and arguably becomes a political tactic here it invites the moral management of consumer economies in charity and the NGOs and the illusion of wealth it fortifies. It may be more pertinent as I see it to observe that population growth is the outcome of economy and that subsistence and waste are tied to their economic model as are attendant ideas. War and its social corrolary in a competitive activity that is at the heart of a society whose final outcome is interstate rivalry empires and ideological war a war of ideas that is now fuming in a society in which I also feel ideas have become meaningless are not fit to their subject is also a constant product and an ethic it is interesting to note the activity of media in society of infocultures in relation to both actual war and as a kind of constant and dislocated conflict akin to the fictitious war in Eurasia in Nineteen Eighty Four whose reality falls open to question variously Stay Calm and consume X We will fight them on the beaches etc. in slimming aid ads coincident with Iraq or the prevalence or reinvention of the Axis and WWII in press and media society is war and pursues war in all spheres rather than trying to avoid it starvation is an acceptable loss in global economy which allegedly wastes a third of its produce and then requires charity and NGOs to both generate minimal solutions and fortify the selfimages of the west et al. Population growth is also vastly linked to economic conditions and social change and one can witness both infant mortality and large family sizes in say th century Britain and the lowered individual birth rate with the growth of middleclassdom. As far as I know global population figures are expected to peak within the next  or so years at around  billion. But the problem is more profound I think. The problem is that ideas have become hollow and it is here that society arrives at its real crises. I hale from among what are claimed the richest countries on earth but my life is an incredible story and a descent into worse and worse austerity at the behest of those systems society touts as wealth I will be lucky to adequately record my own life at all let alone fulfill its possibilities which is a measure of advancement most lives consist in moribund compromise illusion and repetition less commonly they are outright stolen. The st century situation of unified commercial media systems and deepened control blanket censorship the emergence of an infocommerce that has made people its subjects and the objects of consumption as if liberty abolished in free markets a dangerously schizophrenic media and cultural state that sparks and burns where the news is laughably halftrue and has no real critics but dogmas the massmanagement of minds and ideas and the atrophy of senescent historic descriptions that can no longer attend to individual lives now the most stark of political events thereby failing their own criteria the pertinent observation of society and man and recording of history can hardly be seriously called wealth or even healthy. I happen to think thats a railroad to disaster in one form or another one whose social systems classically are unable to escape. All the technology in the world wont help and after all technology is the outcome of historic development and economies too and better existence is entirely feasible without it. Its implementation is driven by the requirements of economies regardless of human beings as product markets suggest characterised by wasteful absurdities that have economic and macrovalue. Anyway I agree. Failed yes. I gradually transitioned from a view of historic development to a reexamination of its mechanics and an examination of pertinent system nested social dynamics to conclude given circumstances I can see and have recorded that annihilation may be as or more likely than survival. Either way I personally have no interest in inhabiting society at all and realised I could have lived a safer fuller and more fulfilled life in primitive conditions rather than as I feel being sacrificed to a system hell bent on its own destruction and civilised savageries. ,cults,d4v9l6y,1,t5_2qzdi

10070369,0,t1_dbjxz4n,The mere fact that there is a dedicated subreddit to documenting the written word of Derek Smart tells me one thing immediately.  That he has enough clout in the space about what he is saying for it to have some merit.  No one has a page dedicated to me on Reddit.  Ive given my opinions on how I feel about Star Citizen and other things.  Hundreds of thousands of others have done the same thing as Mr. Smart yet they dont have Reddit pages.  Why only him?  ,cults,dbk6ws5,8,t5_2qzdi
