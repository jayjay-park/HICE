983838,0,t1_chg0w6q,Ah yes....this is always an interesting thing when it happens. You see we do have formal complaints and we also have the pass up. Youd have to give more of the situation for me to see what exactly happened.  But either way I can tell you for sure some of what happend. First you went alone on this you were the only one that blew the whistle. This makes you a tattle tale no matter what and the manager who was supposed to be backing you was either friends with who ever was about lose their job or was going to lose their job as well and was being twofaced. And most importantly everyone shits their pants when a District Manager or a Regional Manager come in it just happens. Word to the wise have a manager who doesnt give a fuck and is there to do a job and not make friends have your back. they are the best asset because complaints dont disappear when they are around they get fixed Ill get off my little soap box now,tacobell,chg4c88,2,t5_2sd9o

Meals are about . after tax or around there and if you upsize your drink to a large then its around .. Youre now getting that large drink you were already going to get AND a main food item AND Chips.

10519037,0,t3_5qjsf3, I had been super psyched for this ever since I heard about the test marketing so long ago but I honestly thought that the chicken tasted very strange in spite of it seeming very freshly cooked. It was rather rubbery a taste highly reminiscent of some of the worst fried foods Ive eaten in my time. I didnt much mind the overpricing for trying it for the first time the box I got it in was . at my joint  but that chicken left my mouth pretty high and dry unfortunately. I wont beat them up about it though because fried chicken just isnt really Bells thing which it doesnt need to be and the TB I got it from is a very nice one with nice workers who make the food well.I usually like every other LTO anyways so Im already pretty excited for next month.,tacobell,dd0g356,5,t5_2sd9o

We were true brothers and would always make sure we were ok. One night I didnt show up to a party and they got concerned but I had an internship the next morning at am. In the heat of this moment a friend made a drink that was to represent me half jagr half fireball. Drop n chug with shitty beer. The Gentz was born. I dont drink anymore and the memories of those days fall to the haze. But those acts of love I will never forget. ,tacobell,ddi8sw3,2,t5_2sd9o
