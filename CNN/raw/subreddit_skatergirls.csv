Once you can go as fast as you think you can go youre probably ready to try tricks which you should practice on grass and as soon as you land them consistently take them to the street. As for the whole problem with guys trying to date you just ignore them keep asking to go out to skate with them kids who care about skating wont care if you want to date them or not as long as your down to skate. ,skatergirls,d4bypyu,1,t5_2sjav

8527016,0,t3_4vbvox,I have lost about lbs skating over the last couple months.  I started at lbs and I am now lbs.  I think you should learn to push around and get comfortable on the board at a skatepark or just use it for transport then everything else will come in time including weight loss. ,skatergirls,d67fuxw,2,t5_2sjav
