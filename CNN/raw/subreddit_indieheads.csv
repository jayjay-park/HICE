Music Has the Right to Children by Boards of Canada  ROYGBIV is my favorite song on this album but the whole thing is beautiful. Pic Innerspeaker by Tame Impala  Some of the best modern psychedelic rock.The Queen is Dead by The Smiths  Morrisey may just be the biggest douche ever but the guy makes some killer music.The Seer by Swans  This album is pretty gnarly its worth a shot.Pic mbv by My Bloody Valentine  One of my favorite albums of the year it is incredible I would make this one of the higher ranked albums on this list.Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven by Godspeed You! Black Emperor   songs all amazing this or fAinfinity symbol both utilize such beautiful vocal samples.The Lonesome Crowded West by Modest Mouse  Not a huge Modest Mouse guy but Id say the majority of people Ive talked to love this album.Pic Yankee Hotel Foxtrot by Wilco  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You have two legit producers cranking out stuff with CHVRCHES versus one guy with Purity Ring and those producers in CHVRCHES also play instruments pretty decently versus mash buttons.I guess I think of CHVRCHES as sort of the more indie Scottish version of Yelle in terms of instrumentation  production output.

All his records have the same exact sound and they all give off this stupid surfer vibe and he is sure as heck not indie All except Sleep Through the Static. This record is incredibly well produced and performed. He trades his surfer acoustic guitar for a telecaster and plays with a beautiful soothing clean tone. The drums are held back on a tight leash and the keys and bass fill in the gaps incredibly tastefully. Some cheese still gets through but the overall vibe of the record is calm calm and peaceful.

The main elements of the new garage revival seem to be surf music and the music from an old psychedelic compilation called Nuggets. The Ventures are a classic surf band if you want that aspect of the music. The Nuggets compilations are some of the best collections of music around so definitely check those out. Flat Duo Jets are a great group who has been doing this for a while so definitely check them out. Oh also The White Stripes are a garage rock staple. ,indieheads,cgei8xj,3,t5_2zj24

It was a rejection of mainstream New Wave sounds and electro pop s dance music. Do I think all those bands you listed are great? Absolutely! And everyone should listen to them and enjoy them...but theyre not indie either in a broad genre umbrellas sense or in the DIY Anti Label sense. You keep saying theres bands you hate or arent indie just tell me which ones. Again Im not claiming its perfect or for everyone but Im open to feedback and making changes as long as its not I disagree with a lot of those bands or there are so many bad bands with the good bands. ,indieheads,cgpislq,3,t5_2zj24

Just keep in mind that ...Like Clockwork contains the mellowest sound the band has done to date the rest of their discography contains music that is a lot more in your face.

2619624,0,t3_2pw5kd,been writing this over the last few days like a little nerd Protomartyr  Under Color of Official Right Hardly ArtHavent been able to stop listening to this much if at all since I first heard it early this year. Think if Parquet Courts decided to not just be a catchy news headlinemaking goofball troop and instead got a minor alcohol problem in a sad way. Its so dark but its not an album that just works when youre sad. These songs are all so earnest and such a unique turn for the postpunk genre. Its also so short that it doesnt at all get a chance to lose your interest something which I wish Sunbathing Animal would have taken notes on. Scum Rise! Ought  More Than Any Other Day ConstellationThis and Protomartyr are probably tied but since Ought has been getting a least a little love this list season I decided to give it to the underdog. But anyways Ought is so clearly a new indie giant in the making. These guys are going to be huge very very soon. This album is absolute ear candy front to back. Like a post punk meets a sort of young Swansy vibe. Its the kind of songwriting I feel like I would end up doing in college if I was a hundred billion times more talented than I am. The Weather Song The War on Drugs  Lost in the Dream Secretly CanadianOhhhh baby! The War on Drugs have been my favorite band for like  or  years so them finally getting ridiculous recognition warms my heart so much. This album is so memorable even after my first few listens I could point out how every song sounded from memory. It works very much like their previous Slave Ambient while getting rid of some of the minor annoyances like all the extended instrumental songs. Americana just doesnt get any better nowadays. Suffering Freddie Gibbs and Madlib  Pinata Madlib InvazionThis album just works so well. Its pretty easy to compare it to Madvilliany but thats also a weird comparison to make. Each and every beat is incredible and Freddie just straightforward rapping over it without him trying to make a story or something is the best thing that could happen. The vibe never gets tooooo gangstery or unrelateable as the little humorous segments my favorite is the one after High bounce it back up from that. The crazy amounts of features work so well here too which is usually something I dislike in rap albums but I just like hearing how all these artists sound over Madlibs beats. I dont ever see this growing old for me. High Iceage  Plowing Into the Field of Love MatadorGoddamn this hurts so good. Any personal points Id take off on this or the reason theres  albums above it is because it makes me feel a way that I dont really like going to music to feel any more. But its so damn good at doing that. Sure theres a decent amount of sad albums on this list but this is the most convincing one and the only one that really changes my mood by itself. Youve heard from everyone else why this is such a surprisingly good super change of sound for the band so Ill leave it at that. Plowing Into The Field of Love Dub Thompson   Songs Dead OceansThis is gonna be like Ought Jr. in that this is another album where a lot of my joy has come from the potential you can see in the  year olds who made it. Its so short  minutes an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm is more of a time commitment than this little guy so you have no reason not to give it at least one chance. People say that they sound just like Foxygen but I dont see it it doesnt have any of the classic rock vibes and instead trades those for a mixture of Kraut rock Loserera Beck and a touch of Ill Communication Sabotage. Its so good. I love all these songs. Listen to it and have fun yo. Dograces  Run The Jewels  RTJ Mass AppealWhat more can I say? This is such a perfect followup album. They capitalized on all the best parts of the first and got rid of a lot of the bad stuff there are still a few bad choruses in there though. The duo works together infinitely better. All things considered it didnt really take that long to make but shit it seemed like the wait for it took forever but it actually made up for the wait and then some. Lie Cheat Steal Lia Ices  Ices JagjaguwarThis is another huge change of sound for an artist. Lias old stuff is very intimate barren and a little somber heres Love is Won one of my very favorites as proof but for this she somehow got to collaborate with Clams Casino whos known for making beats for the likes of AAP Rocky and Lil B and it completely changed everything. Its not sellouty sounding whatsoever but its a complete change in how upbeat and lush it is. You just want to sunbathe in all these songs. Total pity it didnt get more attention. Higher Viet Cong  Cassette Mexican SummerWhat an appetite wetter this was. If youve been enjoying the st early shame on you   you definitely need to give this a shot. Its just as good as youd want it to be. So fucking into this band its not funny. Static Wall Flying Lotus  Youre Dead! WarpAnother example where Ill just let everyone else speak for me. Im not the biggest straightup jazz fan in the world but I can more than appreciate what he achieved here. Never Catch Melt,indieheads,cn0itxu,31,t5_2zj24

I think theyre successful because the crowd theyre marketed to doesnt have enough jazz listening experience to hear the groups issues with improvisation and groove.

3040321,0,t3_2uzjm2,I went to a twin peaks concert in a small bar club. It was looking to be a great concert the first opener was great and my friends and I were in the very front. Next the second opener came on. A band called the lemons. They come on and start playing beach boys type songs. The lead singer was a six foot something guy with the most awkward hair cut I have ever seen. After the first song he introduces his band. He spoke high pitched and gleefully like a man out of a childrens show and had a laugh to match. It was nearing the end of the set and me and my friends are cracking up because of how absurd this band is and they say that they were going to play their last couple songs. The first song was called the ice cream shop which was about taking their baby to the ice cream shop. Then they said they were going to play a song they just wrote it was the exact same song. Next they were going to cover a song by the featles it started out slow and melodic and then became the exact same song. And then to close out their set they played to song one more time after which they all ran off the stage. My mind was blown. My friends were in shock. We got free pins.

3042596,0,t3_2v0k04,xsegaltrain last.fm Proud greggheadThe Resonars  Bright And DarkCrummy Desert Sound  The Resonars are a band I have really been getting into lately. The first album I heard was Crummy Desert Sound which is an incredibly infectious album of powerpopbritish invasiongarage sounding stuff. I have started to go through their back catalog a bit more they have been releasing music since  and the albums are consistently good. Matt Rendon writes and records most of the albums himself and he has an incredible knack for this style of music. The two albums here each get  bags o corn  bottles of homemade from a Soda Stream orange soda and a pair of Ray Ban Clubmasters as these are two SUNNY albums.The Growlers  Hung At Heart For anyone who is not familiar the Growlers make what they call beach goth music. Although the classification may not make sense at first you will likely understand immediately after listening to them. They are very relaxed and rely heavily on surfgarage music for inspiration but they filter it all through carnival music.  bags o corn  rainbow snocones and an unlimited Fast Pass for the ride of your choice in Disneyland.Mystic Braves  Desert Island  I recently discovered Lollipop Records which kind of seems like the psych sister label to Burger Records. My favourite discovery from the label thus far is Mystic Braves. Desert Island sounds like the album Temples would make if they were American and had more of an affinity for garage rock. Something from this album would likely show up on a modern edition of Nuggets.  bags o corn  cups of green tea and as many full size bean bag chairs as you can fit into living room lava lamps included.GOAT  Commune  The sophmore album by GOAT is one of the most underrated albums from . World Music was an incredibly solid debut and Commune improves upon the sound in almost every way. While World Music was amplified by incredibly fuzzy guitars Commune is a much more reverbed album. All in all Commune is an incredibly groovy mind melting album.  bags o corn  liquefied mind slurpees and the entire Shrek DVD collection signed by The Green One himself  SHREK!,indieheads,codd4dj,3,t5_2zj24

However my attention has started to turn away from the surf scene and back towards the amazing garagepsych scene in the s. I talked about the Nuggets compilation a couple ago and I just want to reiterate how amazing this compilation is. Although none of these songs are from Nuggets all of them would fit perfectly on the album. Artists from the s had an incredible ability to mix psychedelicexperimental textures with catchy garage rock and I think these songs are excellent examples of this sound. Anybody who is a fan of Ty Segall or any music related to Ty Segall should check this out. All of these songs were released in !Chocolate Watchband  Sitting There Standing  The Electric Prunes  Get Me To The World On Time  The Freak Scene  A Million Grains of Sand  The Third Bardo  Im Five Years Ahead Of My Time  Strawberry Alarm Clock  Incense and Peppermints  ,indieheads,coxuxqy,6,t5_2zj24

3368253,0,t3_2yqfle,I just started reading this sub so forgive me if this is more of a pulsetaking but I generally feel like Islands do not get enough mention. Everyone remembers The Unicorns fondly but Nick Thorburns followup never got enough love. Return to the Sea is their quirkiest and the roughest around the edges which might help to explain why less people seemed interested in their later albums. But the followup Arms Way is a pretty massive work of polished cinematic indieprog and probably my alltime favorite of theirs. Vapours veers violently into electropop and is packed with great tunes. Then theres A Sleep And A Forgetting full album not available probably my favorite breakup album of all time and an incredibly beautiful recording throughout. Every album is great and wildly different from the one before leading up to the latest Ski Mask which sort of pulls an In Rainbows and gels all of the bands previous sounds together. Throughout youve got common threads of the macabre and dark humor balanced out with some really sweet and vulnerable moments.One of my favorite bands period and I can only hope youll all say What are you talking about you dingus everyone loves Islands.

Its a nice review though the crux seems to be Sufjan didnt go full orchestral therefore Carrie amp Lowell sucked.What makes the orchestral sound so great? What does that sound bring to the table that is absent in CampL? You dont need a thesislength wall of text to answer these questions but it does take hard thinking and discipline. Critiquing music is hard yakka.Also not a musician but something just feels thoroughly wrong about composing vast rich bombastic soundscapes for a dead distant parent.

I had kept the album on my iPod for quite a while without truly listening to it but never considered deleting it because I knew they were a huge thing. Then one day when I was riding the bus home I put my iPod on shuffle and this song started playing. I was only halfconsciously listening the raspy voice and the ragged guitar strumming took up a lot of mindspace but then he got to the final part when the strumming begins to die out and he lowers his voice and I heard But dont hate her when she gets up to leave.I swear by all that is holy that hit me like a ton of bricks. I dont know exactly what it was what memory or person the lyrics had stirred but I felt it so strongly not too unlike Dylans lyrics obscure not really sure what it really means but when you can just close your eyes and feel thats when I think music is most powerful.

Or maybe thats what youre going for since Id agree with your statement that TPAB is nowhere near the best hiphop album of the decade and that MBDTF and GKMC are. On the main subject of the thread though I think youd have to go as far back as Funeral to find an indie album thats as consistently acclaimed as TPAB.

But now Im back on the search for new music.Listened to for the first time this weekMoodod  Le Monde M  Saw this band live this week and was a pretty cool concert. This album is decent. French flamboyant pop music little weird.The Soft Moon  The Soft Moon Good album. Postpunk instrumentals with a gloomy atmosphere and a wide variety of sounds.Sisyphus  Sisyphus Im not that much into hiphop but listened to this after hearing Alcohol in the listening room. I enjoyed it. Not every track grabbed my attention but I loved the different genres and style bleeding into eachother and the ethereal sounds in some of the tracks.Gruppo di Pawlowski  Neutral Village Massacre I saw this band live this week and that was one crazy show. Album is also great. It sounds a lot like American underground rock  Nowave  Noise Rock. Check out the song on  if youre interestedKing Crimson  In the Court of the Crimson King Talked about this in tbt thread. This album is a classic of course. I only knew st Century Schizoid Man thats my favorite but the rest of the album is totally different.The Go! Team  The Scene Between What a great and fun album. This made a very good first impression and will only grow on me even more. Perfect combination of jangle pop dream pop noise and anthemic melodies. Really bold and colourful album with lush instrumentation. Love it. The Art of Getting By and What DYou Say stick with me the most after the first listen.Say Lou Lou  Lucid Dreaming Their sound is pretty tight and a little bit commercial but this is a decent debut from this band. Planning to listen to Kate Bush this week. I dont know a lot of her but what Ive heard Wuthering Heights she made that song when she was  and Running Up That Hill is great. I probably start with Hounds of Love or The Kick Inside.,indieheads,cq7tmms,6,t5_2zj24

Its great lyrically very easy to vibe to and the short runtime makes you want more and never overstays its welcomeTyler The Creator  Cherry Bomb See all my praise for that Earl album? This does the opposite of all of that. I am less than  hours older than Tyler and this album is far too juvenile for me anyways for someone this old to be making. Theres some good stuff but it loses my interest every time. If he had cut out  minutes and put them either on a deluxe version or an EP later this year I think itd be a hugely better project.Outkast Aquemini is probably their best album but Stankonia is and likely will always be my favorite. I like the tone a lot better the skits are decent and I like the variance. But Ill always like my hip hop for being able to vibe with it over dissecting lyrics. WAND Golem is one of my top  of the year easily so far. Its every bit as stoner psychedelic lofi gnarly as youd want an album right now.

I love Death Grips but Im a bit biased in that Ill always praise an artist for expanding the genre or doing things differently in any substantial way and Death Grips is a great example of that. The ability for them to make challenging music that sounds grating to some and impossibly catchy to others is just remarkable. ,indieheads,cqicr2s,12,t5_2zj24

IDK where I was but I would have loved to have contributed and get a bigger audience besides just you ha.Anyways Id like to touch up more on the Carey MercerWolf Parade connection. The obvious connection here is with Spencer in Swan Lake and Frog Eyes but before that he was actually in Dans band God Shaped Vacuum which then became Atlas Strategic but a different lineupno Carey.Some trivia Carey is the drummer in God Shaped Vacuum which he doesnt do in Swan Lake or Frog Eyes. Just wanted to bring this up because Carey could very well be the connection between Spencer and Dan. Probably not but one can dream. I do love Careys work so it would be pretty sweet if it were true.As for me personally I didnt really gravitate towards one or the other. I immediately fell in love with both Dan and Spencer. I was also obsessed with a lot of their projects. IDK they kind of enabled us because they were so prolific.So yeah check out Atlas Strategic and God Shaped Vacuum. And if you havent already hit up the WP Fansite Lots of good things to be found there like bootlegs of many of their bands and you should be able to find Atlas Strategic releases and the God Shaped Vacuum demo Apocalypse Now.,indieheads,cqvfray,1,t5_2zj24

Thanks to MySpace and Gaia Online I got into emo music. During this time I began to develop bipolar disorder which played a role in why I indentified so much with the emo scene. Conor Oberst was my god.  Ex Bright Eyes MCR Thursday Taking Back Sunday.  Because of my love for s music I started to get into neo psych bands. I used Last fm and mu for recommendations. Loved the fuck out of MGMT and even thought that Congratulations was better than Oracular Spectacular. Loved the whole chillwave aesthetic. Ex Best Coast Tame Impala Deerhunter Neon Indian. Listened to mostly indie folk and shoegaze. Ex Fleet Foxes Bon Iver Slowdive My Bloody Valentine.  to today Right now I listened to anything that songs good to me regardless of the genre.

Eventually life can be viewed as chore. Something that a person endures rather than enjoys. gtIs this the part where I get all I ever wanted? Who said that? Can I get my money back? I think its pretty existential in that it shows FJM is unsatisfied with his life and sees that having a stable job and getting married isnt the key to happiness and that his life is lacking in something but he cant quite put his finger on it that the reaching of your goals doesnt always provide you with that moment of catharsis you are promised. You cant take all these landmarks in life such as graduating starting a career or getting married and use them as the metric to grade your life. In order for any of this to make you happy or fulfilled you have to find a happiness or fulfillment within yourself and that certainly is a whole lot harder than it fucking sounds.

The more I read about the background story the more I liked it. I wish I could relive the first time I heard the beginning of that horn bit in Oh Comely over and over again. This was the first album that really hit my at a gut level and allowed me to really dig deeper into the indie genre. Although the internet memeing allows it to reach people that may not necessarily have heard it before I think it might also dilute the very real connection individuals can  have with it and can also potentially reduce its acclaim to somewhat of a joke or perhaps make those who praise it publicly look like theyre just jumping on some sort of bandwagon. I know its often circlejerked but I have a sincerely personal sentimental connection to this album that isnt necessarily affected by its widespread acclaim which I didnt know existed until later.

4029409,0,t3_36n068,Im days away from signing a lease and moving in with my girlfriend so thats pretty neat. Im super ready to begin a life with her. Also Ive been mainlining baseball all of the time. Im watching Mizzou baseball in the SEC tournament right now. I watch every Royals game with the Cardinals game in the background. I got off work last night and ate some pizza drank some beer and watched a documentary called NoNo the story of Dock Ellis the Pirates pitcher that pitched a nohitter on LSD. It was an extremely moving documentary. I also watched part of a PBS series about the history of baseball before losing some interest and wandering out to the living room to play piano at  AM. I had no idea I could even attempt piano but I did okay. Then I fell asleep to a Japanese baseball game at  AM.This weekend I am going to a wedding on Saturday and then weather permitting A Royals v Cardinals baseball game with my girlfriend on Sunday.TlDR  BaseballEdit Also Ive been on a huge King Gizzard amp the Lizard Wizard kick I think my favorite songs right now are Her amp I and The River.

4122838,0,t3_37vyer,Ill start. I made a thread a while ago about the idea of bad and unconventional singers and a lot of people agreed with the David Byrne quote the better a singers voice the harder it is to believe what theyre saying.Anyway I totally disagree with that. I strongly prefer vocalists with definite vocal talent. Now I dont want all my vocalists to sound like American Idol contestants I want character... but I want it to be good.So my favourites are Matt Berninger James Blake Peter Silberman Thom Yorke DAngelo Erykah Badu Amy Winehouse Feist Jeff Buckley Victoria Legrand Nina Simone Frank Ocean Marvin Gaye hell I actually really like Beyonce eff the haters. And definitely more but those are the first to come to mind.My point is that I far prefer these to vocalists who have to screech or scream or cant hold a note. I never really listen to Bob Dylan. I dont enjoy Win Butlers voice on most of Funeral. The only Lou Reed song I really like is Heroin.Just my personal taste. I feel like a lot of indie fans really like rougher vocalists with less... obvious ? vocal talent. Im trying really hard not to call them bad because that sounds snobbish and I really dont mean for it to sound that way.EDITED because I couldnt stop adding singers...,indieheads,crq88c3,3,t5_2zj24

4179360,0,t3_38opqh,Ive been listening to a bunch of Emo revival bands and some other stuff. Maybe because Im just now graduating high school and its making me sentimental. It also reminds me of time when I was listening to Pop Punk and Emo back when my hormones were all out of wack after hitting puberty. Also I feel people are underrating The Tallest Man on Earths new album. Ive heard some pretty sketchy criticisms that just dont make sense to me. Musically it sounds just as good as the last album and better than Shallow Graves. Not quite as good as The Wild Hunt though. Albums Im currently listening to You Blew It!  Grow Up Dude  You Blew It! seems to be at the forefront of this emo revival. I was lucky enough to see them in concert a year ago. This is a great album thats very catchy all the way through. I love The One With David The World Is...  Whenever If Ever  Now this is an amazing album. It has a lot of stuff from postrock to emo to posthardcore. Best way I can explain it is Explosions in the Sky with emo vocals.American Football  st and EP can anybody say late to the party?  Amazing album and EP that I just now got to listen to. A Big Pile of Leaves  Youre Always On My Mind  Solid album. Snack Attack is a new favorite.Algernon Cadwallader  Some Kind of Cadwallader  Too bad these guys broke up.

4216661,0,t3_39702d,So I wanna talk about Vulnicura and this song real quick. About two weeks after the album came out I ended up breaking up with my girlfriend due to us not seeing eye to eye on certain things. Anyways this album really helped me get through some rough times after the breakup as things got a lot worse postbreakup than they should have been. On the album Bjrk is just so extremely vulnerable and human something she had been missing for a few years. While they are definitely onesided the lyrics to the album are just so striking and really get to me. While theres definitely a huge difference between a  year relationship and a  month one its the fact that you really cared about this person and you put so much trust into them and they just throw it away like its nothing and that fucking hurts.She perfectly captures this feeling on this album and thats why its one of my favorites of the year so far. Also one more thing I ended up writing most of my Vulnicura review while out with my girlfriend so thats a little funny and ironic. ,indieheads,cs0vsmw,10,t5_2zj24

I went to the floor level at the Riviera Theatre amp I was basically second line to start off there. My only complaint was a group of awkward friends who just seemed really stupid. Including two of them just staring into each others eyes while mouthing lyrics. Born Gold amp Braids opened. I enjoyed Born Gold but goddamn Braids was just mesmerizing. Purity Ring was really great too. Megan James is an excellent performer. She gets very close so you just get to feel the fucking energy. Then she crowdsurfed amp I fan girled for that left thigh touch. I have never felt creepier in my life. Afterwards I got to talk to one member from each Born Gold amp Braids. I sadly dont know names so Ill just post pictures! Me with that keyboard dude from Braids who grinds his teeth amp me with that dude from Born Gold who plays keyboard amp some other shit.

4248015,0,t3_39lm12,Heres a big post lol. Taking a little time to catch up on a few of my favorite albums of this year as well as visiting some older stuff that I either like a lot or am listening to the first time. WU LYF  Go Tell Fire On The Mountain Still cant decide if I really like this record or think Its just ok. The instrumentals have a lot of power the reverb heavy guitars are really cool and I think they work well with the drums. Theres also some good bass parts especially on We Bros. The only part thats been hit or miss for me so far is the vocals. They can sometimes have a lot of power and sound pretty good with the instruments like on We Bros but sometimes I just dont think it sounds that great like on Such A Sad Puppy Dog. I need to give this album a few more listens to have a final verdict score wise but right now Id say its sitting at a nice B.Lightning Bolt  Fantasy Empire Probably in my top  for the year so far these guys go hard as fuck. Really fun listen and makes me want to punch something. I think one of the coolest things about this band is the less than traditional bass playing. Brian Gibson makes you feel like youre listening to a guitar player at some parts. BLOrange ampamp Jeremiah Jae  The Night Took Us In Like Family One of the most underrated hip hop albums of this year so far. Really amazing beats from LOrange a nice blend of some other producers styles like Madlib and J Dilla. Jeremiah Jae is an ok MC would have been amazing if LOrange could have gotten a little more high profile MC with a better flow to spit over some of these instrumentals like DOOM or something like that although the likelihood of that happening is pretty low lol. This is a nice B.Deerhunter  Microcastle This is definitely in my top  albums of all time. Deerhunter is such an outstanding band and Microcastle has so much going for it. I think that the best part about this album is the great transitions from the quieter ambient parts at the albums lower points to the really powerful songs like Nothing Ever Happened and Twilight At Carbon Lake. This album is an AUnwound  Leaves Turn Inside You This is a really awesome posthardcore record and the genre of posthardcore is really something that Im planning on getting into some more because I havent really taken the time to listen to it yet I just gave this specific album a listen because Im a fan of mathrock and postrock and those two genres definitely influence this album. Its a good Ath Floor Elevators  The Psychedelic Sounds of the th Floor Elevators One of the most essential psychadelic records of all time if you want to get into s psych listen to this album. AKendrick Lamar  To Pimp A Butterfly So much discussion has already been made about this album I dont really have a whole lot to say besides its pretty fucking great and I think that it deserves basically all the praise it gets. However for some reason I always see myself going back to GKMC a lot more still even a long time after its release. I think that it really just comes down to personal preference between these two albums and I think that theyre both brilliant I just prefer GKMC. This album is an A.Outkast  Aquemini Definitely my favorite hiphop album of all time too many amazing songs on this album to count. In my opinion this album is stacks at his peak. Too much great flow and lyricism and some of those southern hip hop classics are still bumpin like Spotieotiedopalicious. those horns A,indieheads,cs4gpp7,5,t5_2zj24

4541282,0,t3_3d99i6,In case you dont want to watch an eightminute video here are all the points he makes.gt Tame Impala appeared on the scene about  years ago with Innerspeaker.gt I didnt like Innerspeaker as much as everyone else did because it was too Beatles and not that unique.gt Lonerism was better in every way vocally instrumentally and productionwise.gt Unsurprisingly Kevin became the new face of psychrock revival because of that album.gt But Kevin makes the change from psychedelic pop to something more synthetic this time around.gt HI CAL! go to  for this Im not spoiling it. It lasts  seconds.gt There are still some memorable guitar parts despite the albums change in sound.gt I think the use of synthesizers is really creative. He uses lots of effects to make them sound dynamic. Its a good aesthetic change.gt Yes Im Changing and Eventually show Kevins growth as a songwriter. I dig both of these.gt Some new wave influences appear on the supercatchy The Moment which is reminiscent of Everybody Wants to Rule the World.gt The discotinged The Less I Know the Better is also great.gt There are also a few really short tracks to relax us from the really long ones.gt Let It Happen is good and really creative. The repeated loop in the middle sounds like EDM.gt The album remains colorful and engaging despite being more stylistically diverse than Lonerism. The production is fantastic.gt My main issue is with the vocals. Its often a nasal falsetto washed out with effects. Everyone does that these days.gt The vocals arent unlistenable but they get less bearable as the album goes on. It makes something like Cause Im a Man a little hard to listen to.gt Past Life also has this problem but its overshadowed by the weird spoken word bits.gt Reality in Motion has flavorless vocals. Disciples sounds inexplicably unfinished.gt The second half of this album feels really lackluster compared to the first.gt The album ends semistrong but the last track fades out. Odd way to end the album.gt A weird album overall because of how quickly it loses focus as it progresses.gt Not as good as Lonerism but Im still excited for Kevins future music since he took risks on this album. And it was pretty decent.gt Strong  to light .,indieheads,ct32266,34,t5_2zj24

Black Messiah is a highly critically acclaimed album by an artist beloved by the critical community. Not only that but its the first album by DAngelo in  years AND it also touches on topics relevant to  the black lives matter movement.But Black Messiah was released at the tail end of  and so it missed the cut off for Pitchforks end of the year list despite scoring higher than anything else released that year Black Messiah got a . from Pitchfork the next highest albums Benji and To Be Kind only got a .. So this brings me to the .s. Its no secret that Pitchfork has been handing out the .s this year. Kendrick Lamar Sufjan Stevens Jamie xx and now Tame Impala have all got one for their most recent albums. No other  albums released thus far have gotten any score in the  range. So why so many .? Its because Pitchfork is trying to tell us something. And what its trying to tell us is that no matter what great albums come out this year theyll still be a hair below the TRUE greatest album of the year an album that shouldve gotten their AOTY for  but just missed the cut off.

4629326,0,t1_cte2oc3,I definitely agree part of the reason why this question is a bit difficult to answer is that album releases are tied to a time and place and are the result of a time and place albums that served as a clarion call at one point in time become a faint echo when released years or decades later. Sgt. Pepper is timeless but it is of a very specific time. It was released in June  Summer of love just as the movement it was a part of began to crest. It was a great album and it was of its time but the kind of paeans to universalism and love that the album radiated would ring hollow if released in .How can Sgt. Pepper steeped in music hall nostalgia flower power idealism and bohemian art rock sensibilities survive first contact with The Assassination of Bobby Kennedy? The Democratic National Convention of ? The Death of MLK? The Tet offensive? The election of Nixon the heightening of the Vietnam war the radicalization of black and dissident separatist groups? I understand those are U.S specific thats what i know most of but they speak to a general trend the s died as a concept and had bitten the dust by not just in literally it was a new decade but in that the forces of love and hope were in retreat seemingly everywhere. Sgt. Pepper is a creature of the s one of the things that make up contemporary notions of the decade. To release it in ? Its attempting to capture a comet by the tail after its long since past like trying to bottle a zeitgeist thats long since dissipated into bitter recreations and selfmythologization Still a killer album though. ,indieheads,cte3iuq,15,t5_2zj24

Sometimes the entire poem just comes all at once naturally and without much effort sometimes it does take a little incubation in my head. Then depending on what I have available Ill write it out or type it out and edit it from there usually while listening to music. My paper drafts look like I have a mental disorder. Random words and phrases written all over the page arrows and circles everywhere. Im usually pretty quick to chop out a section if I feel it sucks if reworking doesnt lead to anything.

At first and up until relatively recently my favorite bands were all of the British postpunk revival acts like Franz Ferdinand Foals and Arctic Monkeys along with other staples like Vampire Weekend The Strokes The Shins etc. Now I find myself listening to a lot more folk stuff. I still like albums like Holy Fire and the like but Ive been having a lot more fun with Sufjan and Fleet Foxes and Luluc and similar bands recently. Groups that put out music that is less allthetimefun and more about a certain mood or feeling if that makes sense. Now when I go back and listen to albums by people like Franz Ferdinand I enjoy them a lot less which feels weird because they were so important to be only a year or two ago.I wonder if anyone else has any similar experiences.

Its still dark like their last album but less keyboardsynth heavy reverting to how they sounded on their first two albums. They are really pushing for an arenarock vibe or at least thats what I picked up on which is not a bad thing but it wasnt what I sought after in their music. Its great theyre broadening themselves for a wider reach and Im sure this is going to be all over alternative rock stations for a while but I think this song is missing the edge that made them great the way they made me feel listening to Lazy Eye on repeat and never getting bored with it. ,indieheads,ctts3kn,5,t5_2zj24

The gritty ugliness of the individual production elements in Returnal plus the dreamy halfremembered nostalgia that permeates all of his music makes it a good fit for the surreal shifting city of Bellona in Dhalgren.  The bizarre sex scenes and imagery two moons over the city the optic chains of mirrors and prisms and how people come to acquire them and the cyclical nature of the text and writing itself make the two a perfect pairing IMO.  Both Returnal and Dhalgren work to form a piece of art that forces you to think about memory relationships and communication while also acting as a sorto of commentary on their respective medias OPNs careful selection of tambres from eras past says a lot about electronic production itself and Delanys character kidd is literally writing an alternate draft of Dhalgren throughout Dhalgren while being wrapped up in a gorgeously dreamy retrofuturistic aesthetic.,indieheads,cue7yt9,1,t5_2zj24

I had some norco pills left over from when I had my wisdom teeth taken out and was bored so I decided to take some and listen to Before the Quiet Comes for whatever reason. Seldom do I ever use drugs so I have a low tolerance and it didnt take much before I was engrossed by the music.Favorite Only If You Wanna Panda Bear  Crosswords EPAfter loving Panda Bear Meets Grim Reaper I was excited to hear he was coming out with a new project and Crosswords is a great compliment to PBMGR. Simply put if youre a fan of Panda Bear youll be more than likely to like this project.Favorite JabberwockyMac Miller  FacesMy favorite Mac project since K.I.D.S.   because Mac doesnt take himself too seriously and instead just had fun rapping on some really catchy beats. I hope GOODAM is similar but I wont get my hopes up since that doesnt seem like the direction hes moving in.

4953000,0,t3_3iqgpt,Im enjoying it but I literally cannot wrap my mind around how some people are claiming this is their best album. Are you all just caught up in the hype? I cannot fathom how someone could place this album above Bloom and especially above Teen Dream. Once the hype dies down I am  confident that this album will be seen as distinctly secondtier Beach House though even secondtier Beach House is still pretty good all in all.Depression Cherry is enjoyable but it just isnt that big of a change from their past work. By now we all know that Beach House are great at making their signature atmospheric dream pop but I wish theyd actually evolve between albums beyond minor stylistic changes here and there. Additionally nothing on this album is as good as say Myth Walk in the Park Norway or Zebra for starters. Depression Cherry is a solid album but it says a lot when I think to myself why arent I listening to Teen Dream instead? whenever I hear anything from it.,indieheads,cuiv6en,15,t5_2zj24

I think Bejar is an old cranky indie master and this album demonstrates his age with grace hes comfortable he doesnt mind repeating himself. Its his tenth album and his ninth has been his biggest success so I think its going to divide people because his fanbase at this point is pretty varied. There are people out there myself included who really didnt know about him until Kaputt and others who have always known about him through either New Pornographers or just his long career already. People are coming into this album from a lot of different perspectives which is why I think its getting AOTY from some and disappointing from others.,indieheads,cuiz92m,6,t5_2zj24

5061789,0,t3_3k9d86,Sweet! A TWY thread outside rpoppunkers!Ive been following these guys since a little after Suburbia Ive Given You All... came out and they are a frighteningly great band. First that album then The Greatest Generation and now No Closer to Heaven makes for a killer three album stretch in four years.NCTH is what Ive labelled post poppunk because its still rooted in that overeager hypercompressed Warped Tour sound but its like a deliberately mature not mature take on that genre that even gets a little progy at times like on The Bluest Things on Earth. And the core sound of it has a slow intense burn that you dont see a lot of in that scene. But its still scene oriented its not like blinks selftitled or a  album where mature is code for alternative rock.Dan Campbell went out of his way to avoid the Im broke and yearning in the suburbs tropes of past TWY records and I think it works for the most part. Lyrically hes touching on a lot of wide and very heavy stuff here like grief and frustration in Cigarettes amp Saints the commentary on Stained Glass Ceilings and a fucking out and out love song for You in January. And I gotta say it works better than I thought it would at first. Ive seen some fans complain about the mixing and yeah its occasionally a little spotty but I think that complaint has something to do with it being fairly outside the highbeam production thats normal on poppunk records.NCTH didnt register nearly as high as TGG did on the Holy Shit scale although I think a lot of that is due to TGG being an album that was designed for those moments with all the callbacks and I Just Want to Sell Out My Funeral. This album keeps growing on every listen and something I think this sub would enjoy with a few spins.,indieheads,cuw4xux,6,t5_2zj24

The premise of the album with the lead singer going back to their hometown the tension with the situation itself along with the album really it was overwhelming to me.      ,indieheads,cv68t9o,2,t5_2zj24

I havent listened to much of him yet Im just starting to get into it. . The Strokes. Is This It is probably one of my favorite albums of all time.. The National is really good if youre really sad and stuff. Trouble Will Find Me is incredible.. Lost in the Dream by The War on Drugs is pretty good road trip music.. The Suburbs by Arcade Fire. Id consider this a summery album but its still fantastic.. This isnt indie but  by Taylor Swift is probably my favorite pop album and is great when youre cruising down the highway singing about boys at the top of your lungs.Hope this helps D,indieheads,cvqtxp1,8,t5_2zj24

Joanna is probably the most incredible songwriter out there today although her voice can be pretty polarizing. If you enjoy folk and deep brilliant lyrics check this LP out! Kendrick Lamar  To Pimp a Butterfly I liked this album when it came out but it doesnt really have much replayability except from a few songs like King Kunta Alright Hood Politics. Decided to check it out again and enjoyed it Mortal Man is a very good closer.Travis cott  Rodeo Yeah this album fucking bumps. I was really suprised by this and although Traviss lyrics arent anything special he clearly makes up for it with his songwriting and production. Favorite tracks Oh My Dis Side Maria im drunk .Taylor Swift  Aint nobody fucking with my girl TayTay. Probably the best mainstream pop album ive ever heard aint not much more to say. Favorite tracks Blank Space I Know Places New Romantics.Deafheaven  New BermudaDeafheavens new LP really solid and dark metalblackgaze album. Its more accessible than usual black metal so i would recommend this for anyonw trying to get into metal. Favorite tracks Brought to the Water Luna Gifts for the Earth.Freddie Gibbs amp Madlib  PiataYeah this is my jam. Amazing beats as usual from madlib and Freddie delivers hard violent gangsta lyrics. Nothing new but it sure is amazing. Probably my favorite album of . Favorite tracks Scarface Deep High Thuggin Real PiataDeafheaven  Sunbather One of the most accessible metal albums out there and one of the most talked about albums of  for a good reason. Influenced by shoegaze black metal and post rock this album delivers booming aggressive guitars and insane drums aswell as amazing lyrics that sadly cant be heard very well on the album unless you read them while listening i cant recommend this enough really even if you arent a metal fan. Favorite tracks Dream House Sunbather VertigoSt Vincent  ActorReally solid Artpop that i keep coming back to. St Vincent has one of the most consistent discographies i know of and has imo not dropped anything under a . Actor features gritty guitar riffs which is her thing as well as very solid lyrics. Favorite tracks Marrow Laughing with a mouth of blood The StrangersTame Impala  CurrentsAt first i did not like this album. I thought it was too poppy and minimalistic when compared to Tame Impalas previous albums but i see now what they were trying to do with this album and they did good. Its very psychadelic for a pop album and is easy to listen to. Not on my AOTY list but its still worth checking out.

Ocean Beach Colorful Hill Blue Guitar Ghosts and April are all clearly better as well IMO.I guess Benji is a lot easier to digest lyrically a lot less vague and creates an illusion of being private and honest. Even though Kozeleks early stuff like  and Strawberry Hill are actually a lot more honest and emotional than Benji once you get to the bottom of it. Strawberry Hill is heartbreaking.

Schoolgirls were praying  yea to rngesus Until now we just know that she wants to stay playing some weird online game with a lot of rng. This is the verse that gives away Hearthstone and mainly Shaman.  Totems in the nightI want to forgetAll that wasnt rightI need to leave like she wants to forget Totems reminder to those non wizard poker addicts that Shamans hero power is making a totem because the deck is so bad.

5447673,0,t3_3pobit,As someone who dated a lot of hipstersgirls into indie music in his s only to marry a woman who is neither of those things nor isnt really into the same music I am into let me impart the following.Music is amazing. Music is wonderful. Music enriches our lives and music has been a central part of my life since I was a kid listening to my dads old prog records on a Saturday morning. At the end of the day though music isnt important. I know its weird to say something like that but when it comes to a relationship especially a healthy one there are more important things than the music you like. Being able to communicate understanding each other having personalities that click these are the things lasting and worthwhile relationships are made from. Certainly having similar interests and hobbies helps its an ice breaker it provides a common ground to talk on but it shouldnt be the basis of whether someone is worth your attention or even a serious dillema. In fact viewing people in such a way is a detriment avoiding someone or feeling you cant connect to someone based on their musical tastes is needlessly cutting out large swathes of people that might otherwise be wonderful.Further what indie rock loving person DOESNT love someone they can introduce music too. My wife isnt exactly an indie rock fan but shes gotten into bands like CHVRCHES Arcade Fire and Phoenix because of me which is awesome in its own right. ,indieheads,cw7zr5j,80,t5_2zj24

5587123,0,t3_3rnmqg,Whats an album from this year thats good and is also hard to classify under a single genre?  One I try to bring up here when I can is Petite Noirs La Vie Est Belle  Life Is Beautiful. The guy behind Petite Noir has named it noirwave and it has a lot of clear influences but I think he manages those influences really well to create his own sound.  Also Im interested in albums that havent gotten a lot of press when I ask this but Im interested nonetheless in what you all think!,indieheads,cwpmuys,12,t5_2zj24
5587500,0,t3_3rnhof,I think you may be onto something. Most concerts are unique experiences with its own characters and events. For example when I went to see tyler the creator this past summer there was this incredibly disruptive fan who was also drugged out of her mind who kept yelling fuck you tyler and this chubby rocker kid called tyler a ngger straight up. These occurrences derailed the mood of the concert and ultimately killed the experience. But there are also things that interesting enough to note but go unnoticed unless you were at the concert e.g. during AAP Fergs set at Pitchfork people were crowdsurfing a trashcan lol. I dont know these things might not be interesting enough to be mentioned on a blog like Brooklyn Vegan but i think a lot of people would definitely be interested in reading every once in a while. Just look at rhhh. At least once a month theres someone who describes their live experience of a concert and people are always interested to read. Rocky concert review Run The Jewels experience recent Kendrick concert review etc. Some people may say it would be a niche thing and wouldnt get any traction but idk I think if people contribute regularly it could grow. Let me know if you want help to review concerts OP i tend to go to a lot.Edit I meant niche not nice lol,indieheads,cwpojjv,6,t5_2zj24

Remys songwriting I feel has become so focused and welldeveloped and she has such a penchant for dark and pointed lyricism. Even the telephone play gets me to laugh along at the end where the one friend calls herself something along the lines of just another woman with no selfesteem. The album really creates its own sort of world kind of like being inside one of Cindy Shermans Film Stills which the album art seems like a direct allusion to.

5858465,0,t3_3vf2do,revisit  Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel  God damn classic album. Some of the best songwriting ever. Every track is nearly perfect. Favorite Track The BoxerThumbs by Busdriver  Like technically speaking theres nothing wrong with Thumbs. Its a solid rap album production wise that I hated in like every other way. It was just really abrasive music almost nothing was pleasant or interesting to listen to for me. Favorite Track Worlds to Runrevisit  Al Greens Greatest Hits by Al Green  Al Greens music is just so full of soul so full of truth. Not only is this a great compilation of Greens best tracks but these are all some of the best tracks in RampB period. Favorite Track Lets Stay Togetherrevisit  For Emma Forever Ago by Bon Iver  Few albums are as sad as this one. You can feel the sad running through every note. This is what a broken heart sounds like. Favorite Track FlumeSongs for Christmas by Sufjan Stevens  Black Friday passed which means it is officially Christmas season. Bringing in the Christmas spirit in the most indie way possible. Decent album definitely lesser Sufjan. His original tracks were the best parts of the album. Favorite Track Come On! Lets Boogey to the Elf DanceGarden of Delete by Oneotrix Point Never  Interesting music that I totally hated listening to. It just becomes noise but its not really fun to listen to at all. Favorite Track EzraWith the Beatles by The Beatles  Its like Meet the Beatles with  cover tracks in place of  of The Beatles most famous songs. Weirdly my favorite song from the album was a cover. Favorite Track Till There Was YouSound of Silver by LCD Soundsystem  My first LCD Soundsystem. It was really good. Kind of reminded me of something from the s. I loved the majority of it. Some tracks overstayed their welcome and I wasnt too hot on the intro track but overall I think it was really good and Im looking forward to diving into LCDs discography. Favorite Track Time To Get AwayThe Birth of Soul by Ray Charles  I like Ray Charles but listening to this gave me flashbacks to every other song on my iPhone library being a Ray Charles song. Hes not that good. And the songs all blurred together. There were only a few real stand out tracks. I like the guy as an artist I like his story as a person. Im not convinced I like his music. Favorite Track Mary AnnSlow Riot for Zero Kaneda by Godspeed You! Black Emperor  Not only did I discover LCD Soundsystem this week but I also listened to my first Godspeed You! Black Emperor album this week. Their debut EP blew me away. I loved everything about it and I cant wait to dig into their later stuff. Favorite Track Moyarevisit  Electric Ladyland by The Jimi Hendrix Experience  Its good not as good as Are You Experienced? but still very good. Hendrix isnt really my style. I get tired of the long winded guitar solos but he did make a fair share of great songs. Favorite Track Burning of the Midnight LampA Place Like This by Majid Jordan  My random listen of the week. A classmate of minelocal pop sensation recommended that I give this guy a listen. Hes actually really good! Its very emotion heavy rampb in the style of Channel Orange or Drakes Take Care. Its a solid EP and Im looking forward to seeing what this guy has in store for us in the future. Favorite Track A Place Like ThisTurn On the Bright Lights by Interpol  My first Interpol album and I loved it. I feel like this gets talked about a fair bit here and I dont really have anything to add. Its just a really enjoyable interesting album. Favorite Track NYCElvis Presley by Elvis Presley  Ive never been an Elvis man. Theres a good amount of really great songs on here and then theres the stuff that isnt. Its really weird listening to his covers of songs like Tutti Frutti which were done with so much more energy and soul by other artists. That said its still a decent album just very in the middle. Favorite Track I Love You BecauseUnknown Pleasures by Joy Division  Pretty cool album overall. I wasnt really vibing to any song in particular the whole album was just really good. Not entirely my style but enjoyable none the less. Favorite Track New Dawn Fadesrevisit  Beggars Banquet by The Rolling Stones  Has probably my favorite Stones track period and then some solid songs scattered through it. The rest of the album is way too country tinged for me. I like it when its once every few songs but this whole album feels like Wild Horses. Give it to me sparingly I like your rock stuff much more. Favorite Track Sympathy for the DevilRemain in Light by Talking Heads  I havent listened to any Talking Heads in such a long time. My dad was always a huge fan but he hasnt been playing them much recently. I think Ive finally gotten into them myself. Favorite Track Crosseyed and Painless,indieheads,cxnknsg,-1,t5_2zj24

Its been a while so let me see if I can remember why it didnt appeal to me. . . I remember enjoying a lot of the instrumentals but not enjoying her voice all that much. That whispered breathy style did nothing for me. And on songs like Lights Off where that could have been sensual it just wasnt for me. I found the lyrics meh and the songs seemed to drag out. Thanks for the recommendations. So many people love her so Ill give MLLX a shot. I just listened to In Time and it was pretty enjoyable. gtIve been feeling the same. In the club in the rave.

5880755,0,t1_cxqhj5x,Lol I dont like this multiple comment thing weve got going here. Yes there are artists who represent the prevalent attitudes amongst music magazines. I never denied that. My point is that PitchforkindieheadsCos represent a very small subset of the music community. The attitudes of Pitchfork do not represent the attitudes of society at large. That was basically my point from the beginning. There are multiple factors to determining if an artist is mainstream or not. Yes Tame Impala is an extremely well known artist but he isnt Maroon . Theres a noticeable difference there and that difference to me according to my definition of mainstream is that one of those artists is mainstream and the other is not. ,indieheads,cxqhzsf,3,t5_2zj24

I think this record is glorious and worthy of their legacy but I dont think its their best. Id put it somewhere in the middle just ahead of All Hands which was another Great band puts out great record nothing to see here people move along kind of deal. I would like to point out that about half the songs here are worthy of being tapped for the inevitable Greatest Hits comp and thats damn impressive after a tenyear break. I remember being so stoked when Nine Inch Nails came back in  and then I found Hesitation Marks to be perfectly adequate and likable without really adding anything to his story. No Cities is not that kind of album. It slots in well and frequently raises the hairs on the back of my neck yet it doesnt really overshadow their previous work.,indieheads,cxtmy6o,3,t5_2zj24

6015787,0,t3_3xvhkw,I want to take this opportunity to thank the individuals in rindieheads who encouraged me to give this album a chance.I posted a comment in the original release post saying that I was having a hard time getting into this album because of how strange her singing style was. A few people chimed in and talked about how its an acquired taste but her music has so much depth that once you give it a chance it pulls you in. There were some really passionate replies talking about the lyrics in her previous albums which made me decide to listen through the album a few times before passing judgement. They couldnt have been more right. Im absolutely loving this album. The style is so unique and the lyrics and storytelling have so much depth that its impossible not to get drawn in. The melodies and instrumental arrangements are really captivating and theres a sense of beauty and mystery throughout this album which I really love.Over the past few weeks Divers has become one of my favorite albums of the year and Im looking forward to digging through Joannas back catalog. Im waiting until Ive fully digested Divers before doing that which might be a while considering I still dont understand the lyrics in a lot of the songs.If anyone is on the fence about Newsom all I can say is give her a chance. Im definitely glad I did.,indieheads,cy8730l,26,t5_2zj24

6099903,0,t1_cyizn0e,I really love their whole discography of seven songs so far and I think a lot of people agree.

6112199,0,t1_cykbjco,Id say that Bringing it All Back Home is the best entry point for Dylan. The first half of the album is in line with the electric Dylan sound that can be found in some of his other famous albums Highway  Revisited and Blonde on Blonde. The same sound can also be found on The Basement Tapes. The second half of the album is far similar to the sound of his earlier records particularly Another Side of Bob Dylan. Even then the folk sound of Another Side differs from the sound of his very early albums Bob Dylan The Freewheelin Bob Dylan and The Times They are a Changin. Those albums are rooted in traditional folk music whilst Another Side is for the lack of a better word poppier. Dylan makes use of traditional folk structures he learned from musicians such as Dave Van Ronk and Woody Guthrie with the talkin blues style of song being a particular favourite of Dylan.People tend to dismiss his albums after  but honestly I think a lot of the best albums he ever released were put out post . s John Wesley Harding is the complete antithesis of the psychedlia that dominated culture that year instead of following along Dylan released an album of bare bones folk songs with a black and white photograph on the front. This album is very essential and is often overlooked. In my opinion Dylan went on to release two of the best albums of his career in the s. Desire was recorded with the violinist Scarlet Rivera her unique folk sound underpins most of this album. Blood on the Tracks is the break up album. I challenge you to find an album with songs that evoke heartache frustration melancholy and even anger better than this. After an unfortunate period of heavily religious albums Slow Train Coming Saved and Shot of Love Dylan returned in the s to release albums which have dated badly and indeed werent received that well at that time. Infidels is his standout album of the early s. This album was followed by a string of poor releases until s Oh Mercy. Again there was a string of poor releases one of which Under The Red Sky had its roots in childrens nursery rhymes and Im sure Dylan has never released a song as bad as Wiggle Wiggle.In  an album which wholly consisted of traditional folk songs was released. World Gone Wrong marked a return to form for Dylan and indeed marked the start of a period of very strong releases which continues right up to today. It was followed by Time Out of Mind a very undylan like and modern sounding album which is considered by many fans and critics to be the best album that he has ever released. s Love and Theft was based in roots rock and folk and is also an album not worth missing. s Modern Times is based heavily in traditional blues songs and Dylans affected gruff voice in this album helps to lend the songs a new life. His two most recent albums Together Through Life and Tempest continue this period of strong releases and I believe that the next album of original songs he releases will be just as strong. Its also worth listening to some of his live shows. Three from different periods were released Bob Dylan  Live at the Philharmonic Hall  Bob Dylan The Royal Albert Hall concert  and Bob Dylan The Rolling Thunder Revue  are all essential listening. Indeed if you find yourself listening to his very early albums itd be worth listening to Live at the Gaslight  and also Brandeis University . If you find yourself wanting more of this style of Dylan then The Witmark Demos are worth checking out.,indieheads,cyke7ak,5,t5_2zj24

Absolutely no classics on it whatsoever but it has some cool performances of some obscure s stuff as well as an electric version of Pocahontas and an absolutely mindblowing  minute version of Danger Bird.

6197062,0,t3_40gaot,Its weird to think of David Bowie in the past simply because he was such an omnipresent figure in not only my life but the whole of British music. I remember my guitar teaching getting me into Bowie after he recounted how amazing he was at his last UK performance. I became good friends with a friend at university because he had a Bowie t shirt and how we were both super stoked when the Next day was announced.Ill have great memories spent in Berlin listening to Heroes and how Ive rarely had an album fit so well into the environment. I was really hoping for a form of live appearance  even a small one at Glastonbury that will now never happen. I spent all of Friday at work anticipating going home to listen to Blackstar and i felt overwhelmed and amazed how he could create such a great work and how lucky we were to get a Bowie record in . Its reassuring to see so many people affected by his loss even people I wouldnt normally associate liking music. He was a true pioneer and a legend. Its been difficult to comprehend hes actually gone. ,indieheads,cyu1fz0,3,t5_2zj24

6319155,0,t3_425ppv,since Ive never posted in one of these threads I think Ill post what I listened to this month not that much. These are all mostly first impressions so my opinion might change on these later.Ata Kak  Obaa SimaHappy electro music from Ghana. I really wanted to like this more than I did but the music got pretty repetitive and the lofi production doesnt help. Its not bad though. Daa Nyinaa is a great song.John Fahey  The Transfiguration of Blind Joe DeathThis is the first American primitivism album Ive listened to I really loved the atmosphere and his guitar playing is mesmerizing. Id recommend this to anybody who likes folk music.Buena Vista Social Club  stoh man those first few songs are great. I dont understand Spanish but its not necessary to. Groovy and interesting throughout.Susanne Sundfr  Ten Love SongsI saw this a lot but never gave it a listen. I wasnt sure what to expect but it sure wasnt what it ended up being. Really good synthpop shes a great singer as well.Sufjan Stevens  Seven Swansjust listen to it ok? cant believe Ive never listened to the whole thing its perfectEnnio Morricone  Il buono il brutto il cattivoThis is the highest rated film score on RYM and even though its the only one Ive listened to in full I cant see much beating it. Very good stuff here I can feel the spaghetti in meVarious Artists  Sacred Guitar amp Violin Music of the Modern Aztecsits goooood but im probably going to have to give this another listen to give much else to say.Frantz Casseus  Haitian DancesNice mellow guitar playing. Pretty enough.Limalo  Human BloomI think I listened to this before but I cant remember. Really good electronic ambient to the tune of Boards of Canada. Analog synths everywhere very chilled.Koenjihyakkei  Angherr Shisspahas an album ever made you laughbut no this is actually good. if Magma sounds like this at all im certainly giving them a listen. not sure why I listened to this before Magma actually.Joe Meek amp The Blue Men  I Hear a New World An Outer Space Music Fantasylonely music about space. honestly amazing its difficult to believe this was produced in . lots of sound effects pitched up vocals. recommended.Buffy SainteMarie  IlluminationsI just want to say the first track is stellar beautiful singing. Very good psychedelic folk.Family Fodder  Monkey Banana Kitchenits kind of Stereolabesque but not really??? postpunk with a lot of pop influence sounds like a lot but at the same time in its own unique sound.Amanaz  AfricaFuzzy African psych groovy and earthy. I liked it.Esquivel  Other Worlds  Other SoundsA little boring but not bad. Good easy listening music.Dean Blunt amp Inga Copeland  Black Is BeautifulIts nice the synths on some songs kept my attention. Weird intriguing stuff.John Cale  Paris I liked itJeanJacques Perrey  The Amazing New Electronic Pop Sound of JeanJacques PerreyPlinkyplonky electronic stuff from outer space. Fun to listen to The Little Boats is from that one video with the naked dude humping some stairsBark Psychosis  Hexthis is great. atmospheric and beautiful probably going to end up being a favorite. dark and mellow postrock that you can lie down to and just think.yeah I am not cut out for the job of explain why you liked itfuck this is long,indieheads,cz7x27g,4,t5_2zj24

Id recommend them all to anybody whos interested in poetry but Martn was probably my favorite on a pure poetry level while For colored girls was good on that level but also a really good experimental piece.

Just stop and think about the fact that he has at least  full length records that you could hold up to any other record thats come out in the past  years and hes under  are you fuckin kidding me.Hell make these odd decisions but hes able to make them work so seamlessly well with the rest of the song or hell take the song in this direction you just would never guess was coming and you hear it again and think yeah of course thats where this song goes.

7129732,0,t3_4d7emd,Before this I hadnt listened to Psychic so this was my introduction to Jaar. After plenty of listens I can confidently say this is one of the best electronic albums of the decade. I love the way Jaar utilizes the pianoorgan especially on Etre and Balance Between Her Eyes which happened to be my two favorite songs on here. This combination allows for a really potent emotional connection. Balance Between Her Eyes  sounds strangely romantic and passionate as the vocals add an extremely powerful element to the equation. Though Im not sure if this was intentional Etre seems like a beautiful day shrouded in paranoia as the childrens voices seem to place the track at a busy playground. Its difficult to explain but this sort of audio placement wasnt isolated to one track as I envisioned myself in various places from song to song across the album.

Since most of the stuff on the new record is pretty upbeat and danceable they played both bees and loch raven to bring some slower songs in. Bees live is nuts.

Theres so much presented to the listener to reflect on. Ive never thought of any of it as douchey... Especially when hes pretty up front about all of it. I obviously respect and get different opinions but I generally feel like the hate he gets comes from people that dont really give him a fair listen and arent comfortable with his worldview. Like for one reason or another they havent thought critically enough about what he presents or conversely are thinking way to critically in the wrong way about what hes doing or saying.

Extremely superficial readings of songs like Bodies or Kimochi Warui have parts that could point in that direction. Or at least some level of somatic anxiety. A lot of your lyrics seem to discuss this way of building up your sense of self from a composite of other media. What are your thoughts on the different ways of approaching art or just life as either a humanist way of understanding things where some fundamental truth or something is just spilling out of you or antihumanist where were all just made up of these networks of other things and its less about having something pure or original to say?As a follow up to that second question what advice would you give to those of us who have build up our senses of self for years and years in part with your art and have the stupid petty anxiety that now that your music has gained so much popularity it somehow seems cheaper to have such a big part of your identity be CSH fan.

7682218,0,t3_4kjayn,relistened for the first time in a while.I like the album overall but its sort of plagued with similar issues Ive had with their other work where theres no consistency in quality. Some tracks are great Wisdom That Girl Suicide Wasted some feel like not enough time was really spent fleshing things out Hyperventilations lyrics in particular are distractingly awful even as the music is fine and as a whole it just feels a bit too long I dont dislike the unlisted final track but by the time it came on I felt like I was ready to move onto something else.. Not entirely keen on some of the fauxbritish accent thing going on on some of the tracks too. Even an otherwise good track like Wisdom gets knocked down slightly by those vocals.Ive also taken issue with the album being lumped in with shoegaze. I know its nitpicky and all but the approach is much more similar to Spacemen  and early Loop Granted both groups also influenced shoegaze but theyre also ground zero to a lot of NeoPsychedelia The Black Angels Wooden Shjips etc. that is readily identifiable as notshoegaze basically youre much more likely to find something similar to Methodrone on rpsychedelicrock than you are rshoegaze. BJM basically takes Spacemen s sound and ties it back into the original s run basically less Stooges and th Floor Elevators and more Rolling Stones and the relatively thinner guitars that arent usually associated with shoegazes thick walls of sound. This only really bugs me because it seems like shoegaze fans have a really fucking weird blindspot when it comes to psychedelic rock as a whole. ,indieheads,d3ff6hw,5,t5_2zj24

With that being said i still very much disagree agree that drugs are common theme of their music or that they have songs about drugs. Neither of the songs you are cited are about drugs. Both the songs are narrative stories that are being told. Yes they mention drugs in the story but just because something mentions drugs does not mean it is about drugs. Also I dont understand why you cited Ramble on Rose at all. None of those lines you cited seem to be about drugs. ,indieheads,d3o21xz,1,t5_2zj24

7815084,0,t3_4md344,revisit  Coloring Book by Chance the Rapper  Chance is finally on Spotify and its great. Remember when Kanye said that The Life of Pablo was a gospel album and then it wasnt? This is. I continue to love how Chance makes rap so positive and catchy his beats hooks and flow all just feel so cheerful and good. You can tell that Chance is just a good guy. Favorite Track BlessingsHighway to Hell by ACDC  I dont know why I like ACDC so much. I hate most other metal and hard rock like Metallica but ACDC is just so easy to jam out to. I love their style. Favorite Track Highway to HellVisions by Grimes  I can appreciate the production on this but its hard to get into most of the songs on here for me. I still like it much more than Art Angels. Favorite Track SkinIII EP by Sheer Mag  Solid punk music. Nothing great nothing super special or outstanding just solid punk music. Favorite Track Night Isnt BrightThe Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails  Trent Reznors musical genius is palpable here. Each track is layered with so much noise and its just plain impressive. He puts so much thought into creating chaos. That said its too chaotic for me. If I want Trent Reznor Ill take The Social Network over Nine Inch Nails. Great music that I mostly cant dig. Favorite Track Hurtrevisit  Views by Drake  Why you gotta fight me at cheesecake? You know I love to go there. Okay so I know most people hate this album now but I still really really enjoy it. It never really gets dull each song is different unique and silly. His worst lyrics are hilarious his best are meaningful. What is pop music without being a little silly? Its not Take Care its nowhere close but its highly enjoyable. Favorite Track ViewsKaputt by Destroyer  I just dont like Destroyers style. Sorry. I wish I could buy into the hype. Favorite Track Poor in LoveAvatar original movie soundtrack by James Horner  Saw a Cirque du Soleil show dedicated to Avatar and had the urge to listen to the movie soundtrack again. Its so good. Sometimes I forget just how good every element of this film is. Favorite Track Jakes first flightSVIIB by School of Seven Bells  Lots of really solid tracks and a thoroughly enjoyable listen but nothing to really stick in my head or make me want to sing along. Favorite track AblazeParsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme by Simon and Garfunkel  My Grade  through  English teacher always gave Scarborough Fair as an example of a perfectly written song. I agree. Favorite Track Scarborough FairThe Seer by Swans  This album is long as fuck but its enjoyable. There are moments in all the long songs where I disliked them but they always build to a point where its worth it. Not a casual listen type album at all. Favorite Track The SeerOuter Acid EP by Mr. Fingers  This wasnt as weird as I assumed it would be. Just some neat experimental techno. Favorite Track Qwazersrevisit  For Emma Forever Ago by Bon Iver  This is my comfort album. It mellows me out makes me want to sleep makes my mind stop racing. I love it and I love the effect it has on me. Definitely a top ten album for me and a testament to the beauty in sadness. Favorite Track Skinny Loverevisit  The Wilderness by Explosions in the Sky  I love how every track builds to such a peak. It may be formulaic in how they start small and grow huge on every track but I love this. Explosions in the Sky is like Godspeed! with shorter songs in a way. Favorite Track Losing the Lightrevisit  Javelin by Jordan Klassen  Orchestral indie rock by way of Arcade Fire or Sufjans Illinois. Its that kind of album. Some of the songs on here stand up with those some dont but its always an entertaining listen no matter what. Favorite Track No SalesmanBad by Michael Jackson  Its no Thriller but still a great collection of tracks with no huge weak spots. Favorite Track Man in the MirrorRacine Carre by Stromae  I was in Montreal this week so I kind of felt obligated to listen to some French raphouse music. Stromae is pretty decent. Some great songs on here. But also some ridiculously cheesy ones. Hes a very good producer though Ill give him that. Favorite Track PapaoutaiHave One On Me by Joanna Newsom  Always kind of avoided Joanna Newsom because shes not on Spotify didnt realize that her albums are all on Youtube in full. Shes good I cant say I love her as much as everyone else seems to. Her voice is sweet her songwriting is very classical the harp playing is beautiful but every track goes on forever. I liked it for the most part but I know I would have liked the album more if it wasnt two hours. Favorite Track Baby BirchBarbara Barbara we face a shining future by Underworld  Decent house music. Some of the early songs are a little abrasive and hard to listen to but then as the album progresses there are some really nice tracks that make me think of artists like Caribou. Decent record.

I can understand the vinyl resurgence because at least there you get decent audio quality assuming your table is properly calibrated and you take care of your records and the larger format leaves lots of room for cover art and inserts but cassettes were always riddled with problems inherently poor audio quality the everpresent tape hiss proneness to warping especially in the heat  make note if you plan on keeping them in your car jamming tangling breaking etc. Rather than investing in cassettes you might want to consider swapping in a cheap bluetooth head unit instead.

8202359,0,t3_4qodis,Black Pistol Fire  Dont Wake the Riot  Excellent th album from this piece dirty blues rock band. Terrific guitar work lots of variety in song styles interesting vocals. Vastly underrated in my opinion. Check out the song Fleet Foot    The Last Shadow Puppets  Everything Youve Come to Expect  This was a bit of a sleeper for me. It seems to grow on my every day. The video for Aviation was what kicked it off in my mind.    Frightened Rabbit  Painting of a Panic Attack  Knew nothing about this band prior to this album. As a huge fan of Foals its right up my alley. Honestly this is what the last Foals album shouldve been. My favorite is Little Drum    Andrew Bird  Are You Serious  This is Andrew Bird at his most accessible. I was never a big fan and this is what pulled me in. I just love Left Handed Kisses Currently my album of the year.    Wolfmother  Victorious  Wolfmother is really firing on all cylinders with their latest. Its everything they set out to accomplish as a band all wrapped up in a very cohesive album. Eye of the Beholder might just be my favorite Wolfmother song ever. That breakdown at ...OMG.    Savages  Adore Life  Intense dramatic effort from this band. The whole thing is a really good listen. T.I.W.Y.G will definitely make my yearend list.    David Bowie  Blackstar  The swansong of a legend. Its perfectly executed and highly memorable. Lazarus brings me to tears every time.,indieheads,d52uk9g,2,t5_2zj24

The engineeringsonic choices seemed so weird and unfashionable alongside that bizarre lyric that it really stuck in my mind.Eventually I scooped up the CD at my local library.  I was pleased to find that I enjoyed every track.  A frequent point of comparison is the Roxy Music album Avalon.  Not so sure about that but I can definitely hear the influence of s tropes.  The chorused guitar sounds the supercompressed snares the digital reverb...What do you think of the recurrence of the phrase Song for America...Who knew? in two tracks?  Do you suppose its possible that these two songs began their lives as a single song?  Or even a single lyric?

Good memories. Paramore   The Only ExceptionI used cry every tim this song came on and I constantly listened to this Brand New Eyes for like a year along with stuff like MCR and The Simple Plan. I got my first kiss with this song playing in the backgroundSuicide Demo For Kara Walker   DestroyerIntroduced me to my favourite album of all time all though Ive found the rest of Destroyers discography to be hit andmiss for me. Bonus album as a wholeBenji  Sun Kil MoonI listened to this album constantly while in a mental hospital and it was very cathartic in helping me deal  with my emotions.

Best I can do to describe it would be Laura Marling  Waxahatchee  Sibylle Baier with some electronic embellishments. Overall its quite dark in tone the album cover evokes this perfectly. There honestly isnt a single song here that Im not loving at the moment. Definitely give this a listen if you like sombre female singersongwriters my favourite genreLady Lamb  After only given this one listen all the way through so cant say anything conclusive but its pretty good. Getting a bit of a Waxahatchee vibe with this as well but the use of brass really sets it apart. Favourite tracks so far are Vena Cava Billions of Eyes and Penny LicksOther than that Ive been really enjoying Satanic Panic in the Attic the lyric about taxi drivers in My British Tour Diary is so accurateIf youve got any recommendations thatd be fantastic,indieheads,d5ddpzc,2,t5_2zj24

8500585,0,t1_d63pzey,Yessssss I agree! Its Wide Awake its Morning is seriously probably his best album ever. I also love Lifted or the Story is in the Soil Keep Your Ear to the Ground for nostalgic value because that was the very first BE album Ive ever listened to. It also contains what I think is his best song ever Lets Not Shit Ourselves To Love and To be Loved. Fevers and Mirrors is great and doesnt get enough love IMO and thats not cheesy at all. Conors lyrics are extremely relatable. When I was at my worse mentally No Lies Just Love was my thing to the point that I cant listen to it now...

Modest Mouse was there for me when I didnt really have anybody to socialize with and the lyrics were really having an impact on me.I was lucky enough to see them in concert last week when they came to LA and it was a holy experience.

You have all the singles  Dani California Tell Me Baby Snow Hey Oh  and those are all good in my mind at least. But arguably my two favorite RHCP songs  Desecration Smile and Wet Sand  are here as well. And then youve got other fun hookheavy tracks like Shes Only  Strip My Mind and Charlie. Theres a lot of variety here the focus is as much or more on the guitar and bass as it is on Kiedis and the songwriting while not always impressive is consistently playful and never outright bad. I dunno I get why it isnt everyones favorite but its becoming a sort of black sheep in their discography and I just dont think that makes sense. ,indieheads,d6mt52v,4,t5_2zj24

8794304,1,t1_d74y19i,its definitely a classic but i personally dont like it. i think Aeroplane has proved to be much more influential in sound than Is This It I think any band thats seemingly influenced by the Strokes is essentially just influenced by Television and TVU and Aeroplane itself is much more inventive than Is This It much more varied instrumentation with the heavy brass band influence the songs themselves are more complex and interesting. and I just enjoy listening to it more. Casablanca is just a boring vocalist to me Mangum has a lot of passion. also i think the chord garage rock revival sound has been done to death and I dont think the Strokes really do anything to keep it fresh.,indieheads,d74yfqc,2,t5_2zj24

Theyre no different than any of his other great albums  a series of meticulously crafted vignettes except Franks Wild Years which strayed into operaform.   He only has two de facto weak albums Real Gone and Closing Time. The former being a misstep in style the latter is basic LoungeTrad Pop that belonged to the s albeit its enjoyable to just sit back and play.  His best would go  . Swordfishtrombones  .

Yes the soundscape is absolutely unique not to mention the hip hop influences but the rhythm and the earworm chorus make this more accessible than  of their other songs.

ZABA was mysterious and quirky without being pretentious but it didnt communicate as much raw feeling as this one does. theyre for two completely different moods which makes them interesting to compare and which shows a lot of potential.Best tracks Life Itself Youth Pork SodaMost meh track not counting Premade Sandwiches probably Take A Slice though I still like itGrown on me the most Season  Episode I really hope these guys end up taking an Animal Collective kind of trajectory. not saying theyll be as influential as AnCo but I hope that they put out a lot of quality albums with varied sounds and influences and then their individual members make solo efforts because theyre all talented multiinstrumentalists with a lot to offer.edit also this unrelated to the album but I would like to take this time to say that I am unbelievably obsessed with the guitaristkeysbackup vocalist Drew  tell me this aint a beautiful man.,indieheads,d82oeub,12,t5_2zj24

9122247,0,t3_5584dp,Wolf People  RuinsThrowback to Cream Traffic Fairport Conventionera Psych Rock. Less Renn Faire and heavier overall or at least better at mixing the two than they did on their previous album. Runs out of energy towards the end and the album ends very suddenly? but the closing jam on Salts Mill is good. Alcest  KodamaA return to form after the very lightweight Shelter. While the black metal is back its not quite the retread of past sounds maybe subtle but there seems to be more arpeggiated guitars and synths give it a vaguely s feel think Maserati minus the motorik and closer Onyx is the closest hes come to actually sounding like My Bloody Valentines layered guitar drone. Emma Ruth Rundle  Marked for Deathlike the Steven Seagal movie presumably. Red SparrowesMarriages singer guitarists solo album that goes from psychedelic folk to harder rock. Peaks with Heaven and never quite gets as interesting. Not sure what it is but something about her voice rubs me the wrong way its not bad but it seems a little too over the top at times. Jagwar Ma  Every Now amp ThenI didnt really have high hopes for this but this was still worse than I thought it would be. I liked their last album and hoped they would maybe streamline the dancey and psychpop bits and well they kind of did but it all sounds like very undercooked dancey parts that seem tailored made for someone else to flesh things out with remixes. The middle run of tracks are pretty good though not matching Howlings best but everything else is largely pointless rough drafts. ,indieheads,d88cfey,1,t5_2zj24

It led me to a love of postrock which has led me to experimental music electronic ambient metal etc.. Kanye West  The College Dropout  I never truly understood the appeal of rap until I heard this. The production stood out and eventually I figured out how to enjoy the rapping as well.. Prince  Sign O The Times  I grew up listening to Prince and its hard to pick one particular album but when I began thinking about music more indepth this became my favorite and Im sure it shapes my taste in ways I havent even noticed.. Radiohead  The King of Limbs  Ive chosen this one because I love it more than most people do always in my Radiohead Top  sometimes at the top. It helped me to understand that sometimes youll just love music that most people cant get into and its ok for your tastes not to line up with what youre supposed to like. Reject the idea of guilty pleasures.,indieheads,d8m83g5,5,t5_2zj24

9800743,0,t1_dal0ymi,Oh boy. I have so many thoughts about this I dont know where to start. First and foremost understand that I do not think it is sexist to put together a top  list of albums and not include a female artist or group involving a woman. Rather I think it is a product of sexism. Yeah there are less monumental historic female artists than men. Before the age of the internet women had way less opportunities to get themselves out there. It was unlikely that they were encouraged to go into a career of musicianship in the first place and if they chose to they were taken less seriously than their male counterparts. So the number of women who are going to come out on top despite every obstacle will be fewer. But that should not be an excuse for us to discredit or ignore female musicianship and it holds no relevance to the number of women in music today. You have listened to thousands of albums okay. Where do you find these thousands of albums to listen to? Blogs other indieheads friends? How do you think they determine which albums to listen to to report on to share? Do you think unconscious biases are not at work? Female artists like Grimes and Mitski have expressed the sexism they see in the music industry and they are big names at least in the indie scene. Im sure smaller acts featuring women experience even more sexism and implicit biases against them. Id bet that the albums by smallish artists that Pitchfork reviews are much more malecentric than female even if they dont do it on purpose. If its so lazy to say we cant quantify the ratio how about you go and do it? I wish you luck. Theres a lot of artists on Bandcamp Spotify Google Play...and if you want to categorize them by genre even harder because no one can agree on what genres mean these days. You better like spreadsheets and scrounging the depths of the internet trying to find out if certain obscure acts have a woman in them. Speaking of laziness you know what I think is lazy? Deciding that because men dominate the music industry there simply must be more men in music than women.  As for disingenuous attitudes I think one is to pretend that sexism isnt rampant in both conscious and unconscious forms. Another is to pretend that women consistently coming in at lt often lt or even lt! representation on every best of list festival line up or curated playlist isnt weird.Im not saying we should include women in our lists just for the hell of it. Im just saying that theres a discrepancy and trying my very best to back it up with data thats attainable for one person to find in their spare time. You say that doesnt solve the actual issue but I think its a better start than whatever youre doing.,indieheads,dal5icz,3,t5_2zj24

Beyonce could keep making nonoffensive pop records that get all the top  radio airplay she wants but shed rather stir the pot.

10403723,1,t1_dcnai67,The Life of Pablo Because the Internet Doris are kinda my goto meh hiphop albums. Im no big listener of hiphop by any means and I wont claim to be wellversed in the genre but I meant that Yeezus was below average for an album in any genre in my opinion.Yeezus falls slightly behind s and Heartbreak for me and further behind The Life of Pablo. Everything else Kanyes done especially his first three albums are all astronomically better than Yeezus. The College Dropout is absolutely wonderful and two albums succeeding it are both great as well. Im not hating on Kanye because hes changed up his formula but because its a change that hes only been able to pull off in a hitmiss fashion with s and Yeezus misses and Dark Twisted Fantasy definitely a hit although I think its a tad overrated.I dont understand this vitriol people spew towards anyone who remotely criticizes this godman even if all someone says is that theyre just not that into this album or that album. Im more than willing to admit that hes talented and that hes made a great amount of fantastic music throughout his career but the whole OMG THIS GUY DOESNT LIKE insert kanye album AS MUCH AS ME.

Then stay involved and surrounded by good design and KEEP MAKING STUFF. Stay passionate and keep learning. A lot of successful designers dont get recognized until later in their career.Im not great myself. I read a lot I think I know a lot and am aware. But I dont make nearly as much good work as Id like because I put most of my time into a job that doesnt encourage me to make great design just mostly production work. Anyway you are doing fine.

I was mind blown and the album became extra sad.

10597778,0,t1_dd90f0x,Damn just looked him up never once heard his name hes pretty good thanks. Low key though I think Elliott Smith is the greatest songwriter and one of the greatest guitar players of all time and with EitherOr turning  people are starting to recognize how incredible his shit is. Once I started learning his songs on guitar I realized how ridiculous some of the stuff he did was. It actually infuriates me how well he played his guitar parts in live performances probably drunk as fuck too. You would swear there was a second guy playing off stage. Not to mention his arrangements harmony and lyrics. Im glad people are starting to put him in the same conversation as the Beatles Dylan etc. because when I compare my own songs to Elliott Smith he makes me feel like Rebecca Black or some shit. Like absolute shit. This same thing doesnt happen with other greats like Radiohead or The Beatles because I feel like I have a grasp of why they made their musical decisions and stuff and they give me hope to aspire to their level through similar means lol not gonna happen. But Elliott Smith was a god damned madman. He had the insane conviction and technicality to force feeling and beauty into musical arrangements in ways that Im still trying to understand. Ive never seen another musician just make chords their bitch like Elliott Smith did. ,indieheads,dd92v61,37,t5_2zj24

Context matters in indie music whether you like it or not. Dirty ProjectorsLongstreth unlike the experimental artists you listed are known for their keen melodic sensibilities and affectionate arrangements which tend to be more respected in the indie community. We like music that we can connect to emotionally. This album has a decisive narrative and direct pop song structures in addition to the experimental elements. For an established indie band like DP the same one that made the landmark album Bitte Orca this album is a pretty ambitious endeavor. I can say it is definitely bound to be influential because every DP album so far has been pretty influential on many artists. Bitte Orca was influential and honestly it followed a pretty similar formula as this album in terms of experimenting with RampB and electronic trends of the time as well as lush string arrangementsvocal harmonies. ,indieheads,de1ri5v,3,t5_2zj24

11015291,0,t3_5xal2h,xNewish albums for meSampha  Process This is pretty good. Was not expecting a UK Bass? album after the No One Knows Me Like The Piano single but the production slaps. My major complaint is that the album doesnt really stick with me even after  listens but its great while youre in it. King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard  Flying Microtonal Banana Pretty disappointed. First three songs are great as well as Nuclear City but the rest seems like cutanddry psychedelia. Its still King Gizz but after Nonagon I was expecting something awesome. .Arca  Xen Revisiting this after not really getting it a few years ago. I like its more songbased feel having checked out Mutant in . Arca really creates a vibe like no other and Im absolutely entranced with the visuals his songs get paired with. Excited for st in April. .Dirty Projectors  st Absolutely awesome continues to improve the more I listen to it. As many people have pointed out having Dave do BizarroUniverse Justin Timberlake on Death Spiral is incredible. Other song highlights drone solo with cowbells under it in Ascent Through Clouds breakcore drums in Work Together and the organ in I See You. Tim Hecker  Virgins I know it shows Haunt Me x but I wanted to talk about this This man is something else. Much like Arca the first times I tried him I wanted something more songfocused but I eventually grew to love the vibe he creates. Virgins with its semiacoustic instrumentation really does wonders for me. Cant get over how good Live RoomgtLive Room OutgtVirginal II is. Definitely one of those albums I wished I checked out sooner. .,indieheads,degjw60,8,t5_2zj24

Self titled songs do seem like a roadmap of things to come but in the same vein theyre LCD at their most raw and creative.  Everything sounds so fucking exciting and fun compared to their later stuff and fun is what Im looking for when I go to a song from them.

11264514,0,t3_60ns2p,Things are getting pretty intense so nows the time for some indepth analysis. Im nowhere near as entertaining as the March Madness guy but I hope my rabid contrarianism will inspire some interest.Theres no question that Funeral is a definitive album but the definitive album released most recently prior to it was Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. YHF is damn near unrivaled and has absolutely no dull moments while I think Funeral can be a tad inconsistent. Both deserve their accolades to be sure but YHF pushes just a little bit further in all the right places which is why Ive given it my vote.Im gonna echo the opinion that The Suburbs and Is This It are both overrated but still both pretty decent albums. I think The Suburbs broadness works against it here as Is This It is lean and mean with no misplaced riffs. Even if it doesnt go too far in what it does it doesnt meander anywhere near as much as The Suburbs does which gives it the edge in my eye. All in all though Im really lamenting Neon Bible not making it further because I think it might be a solid contender for my top  of the last  years. God  was great.Every matchup including TPAB has been easy for me because I think its one of the most overrated albums in recent history. Ive warmed up to it a bit to be sure but too much of the album is filler with no more than two of good lyrics good delivery and good instrumentals. Its decent but nowhere worth the deification its received. Illinois however is as good as this sub says and one of the closest things to perfection Ive ever heard. Itll be heartbreaking to have to vote against next round.Dont get me wrong I love In Rainbows. Its my second favourite Radiohead album after Kid A. Sound of Silver though is the only album from this millennium other than Kid A in my top  of all time. Its my favourite to win the tournament by a sizeable margin and regardless of what albums could have been in the final  would be my pick every time.,indieheads,df8te9x,3,t5_2zj24

11272135,0,t3_60vabp,I love tigers jaw! I literally screamed a little bit. Il give my Thoughts in a bitEDIT well here goes First impressions are that it sounds sort of generic pop punk but with the iconic at least to me Tigers Jaw sound. I love the melancholy singing thats kind of a staple of the band and i think that the lyrics work really well with the tone. This song does seem a little bit more happy than some of their other songs.  Its catchy and i think some people wont like it for that not that it wouldnt have bothered them on previous records. I know some people think that music thats too catchy or accessible isnt very good. personally i disagree but to each their own. Musically Its got the regular guitar and the pianosynth sound that sets apart tigers jaw for me. its not overly complex in any way but what makes it different and more appealing to me is probably that its in a sort of duet format with male and female voices as well as the piano and melancholy singing which i had mentioned before. Overall thoughts are that its a good catchy song that has the tigers jaw sound My favorite album was by far their self titled one It seems to me like their going back to that sound a bit more. As an aside note I happen to generally like absurd lyrics quite a bit and the chorus lines Burn a candle to my skin turn the handle let me in do that for me. Other side note I love watching them goof around and work together in the video.,indieheads,df9ohpo,2,t5_2zj24

11335663,0,t3_61sdur,At the time In Rainbows came out my music tastes were very limited. I didnt branch out far from the few lame bands I listened too. Though to be fair OK Computer was a favorite of mine when I discovered it in high school a couple years before In Rainbows came out.To be honest the only reason I listened to In Rainbows was because of the pay want you want aka free for my broke high school ass business model. But I fell in love with the album and its the reason Radiohead is one of my favorite bands today and for that it will always have a special place in my heart. ,indieheads,dfgvlq7,27,t5_2zj24

11486781,0,t1_dfxeqqy,If what you say is true then I think the jokes on everyone else. Look at his April Fools thing. Hes really...having some fun. Let me get back to the meat of your post. I think I can rescue this plane before it hits the ground. Lets see if I can change your mind and make a convert here.gtSomebody in this thread said some of the songs may be the greatest songs theyve ever heard and like this exactly is the kind of hyperbole that emerges from this kind of overanalyzation. Have zero problem with that. If you are deeply analysing what hes saying you are missing the forest for the trees. Its not him whos being obnoxious its him manipulating people into being obnoxious and laughing at it.gtLike yet another commenter above said his whole goal is to bring you into this album with so many thoughts I promise you its not. His stuff has been elegantly simple and if anything I think hes dumbed this one down a bit. gtthat you HAVE to dive deep HAVE to pick the songs apart HAVE to theorize and debate. For me every single song every word lyric idea etc is straightforward. This record isnt filled with innuendo hidden meaning grandiose imagery vague ideas etc. He is literally saying over and over again that hes from a certain background now hes a different person and theres a bridge for all of it. Hes dealing out shit equally to everyone but what sounds like condemnation is sympathy and what sounds like sympathy is pointing out hypocrisy.gtI dont think he is at all interesting enough to dedicate this level of discussion to and thats why I find him personally annoying. And even that plays into what he wants. Its just. So. Tiring.Its not him its the people who think they get him and dont. Hes actually quite interesting if you just take every word he says at face value laugh at absurdity be serious find some empathy etc. What hes doing is brilliant because hes made it so simple that  of people should be able to get it and  of people dont get it because theyre projecting. In the meantime hes laughing and probably depressed at being proven right that people have missed the point.You know those TV manuals where the first step for troubleshooting is Have you plugged the TV in...its like people with a BS in electronic engineering are tearing the TV apart and testing every component when his entire point was to tell you to just plug it in.That is the genius here. Not the blowhards with an agenda. Hes mocking those people. Listen to the record like watching a movie where the moral is clear take everything literally at face value and think about his upbringing emergence and his concern with the world...coupled with the fact hes a buttonpusher. Tell me if it changes your perspective. ,indieheads,dfy0x0x,5,t5_2zj24

11497341,0,t1_dfz767c,Hmm thats interesting. Whens the last time you tried listening? I absolutely hated plastic beach on first listen but now I appreciate it. The lyrics are certainly a lot more tongue in cheek but I think the vocals are lovely. All the songs you listed as hating are some of my favorites on the album. Also pirates progress is an iTunes only track maybe there are others that are exclusive that are diluting the album for you? Ive only got the physical release so Im unsure. I can certainly relate though I used to hate sweepstakes but you gotta listen all the way through how the different elements build on top of one another is very impressive which is how I feel about the album in general. As for the new stuff I cant stand the lyrical content. Andromeda has a kicking beat but I think these lyrics have the least substance by far. Cashing in on current political events is so cheap to me.

11517070,0,t1_dg1bdb5,gtPure Comedy is pretty much any radical pseudointellectual liberal chillosophers agenda set to a simple soundtrack. This is a caustic mostly boring album that at its worst sounds like the delusional rantings of a manic man and at best a deviant diatribe by a fear mongering philosophy professor angling for tenure. This literally put me to sleep the first time i listened to it.yadda yadda whatever Zig. I can see this being taken from a surfacelevel reading of some of the songs but if you look at the project conceptually it just doesnt hold up. But I guess getting a good grasp of such things wrecks the hottake karma game right?Like Im not saying its the best album ever but it is a reasonable enough application of neosartresian principles to modernity. Its not really saying anything particularly new but the old things it repeats are reasonably effective. I also feel like Tillman has very recently read Structure Sign and Play  and hes trying to engage in a bit of a poststructuralist critique. But here Im not sure Tillman has the working knowledge of Derrida to make it land as well as it otherwise would. Regardless hes picking up on legitimate tensions underlying the teleological debates America is having within itself. Two Different Perspectives while grossly oversimplified sort of trades off the basic existentialism for debating legal realism v natural law within the context of American partisanship. Its a neat song and I appreciate his ability to simplify complex issues into neat little punch lines.Anyways diminishing this into pseudointellectual and liberal is a critical misunderstanding of the person the project the goal and seems like you just wanted a snippy little leadoff sentence. Tillman is reasonably informed about what hes trying to talk about and its a very unusual topicset for mainstream pop music. Perhaps you havent read enough to engage with the material in which case Sign Structure and Play would be a good place to start.Its also not a liberal work either in the liberal sense endorsing the modern liberal agenda in the classical sense endorsing absolute rights over govt interference or in the philosophical sense. As a work it endorses a view while not as radical as Sartre Tillman isnt saying prisoners are free or the subsartresian thinkers is pretty consistent with atheistic existentialism. Kinda like Ivans initial position in Brothers Karamazov. God is unknowable no tangible result on human values resultant human composition while not necessarily correct should try and engage the concept of human dignity as much as possible.Anyways lyrics are phenomenal is what Im saying. They wouldnt make a great article or anything as it really heavily heavily simplifies bigscreen academic debates in way that doesnt quite get a great picture of all the moving parts. But its just crazy that a popfolk artist a popfolk artist whos mostly produced crap and schlock to this point has came out with something so thoughtful and reasonable.

I know the most I listen to QotSA is when I work out simply because thats probably the most I listen to music. And for all their other albums I have like  songs from those albums that I listen to regularly during a work out. But from LC I only listen to My God is the Sun.

11685619,0,t1_dgkim1b,Personal preference but Id start on a nylon acoustic which is how I started. A lot of peoples fingers arent used to how tough steel strings can be on them and need some practice on nylon first. However I recommend trying a steel string guitar before you buy anything and if it doesnt hurt go for that because nylons arent all too practical outside of classical and practicing. I guess my viewpoint is different because I started with classical when I was really young but thats my opinion. As for electric or acoustic it really depends on what music youd like to play. Personally I find an acoustic is much more versatile as you can play a lot of genres on it and you can just sit down really anywhere and play it with no setup. However most rock songs will sound much better on electric. Definitely try some things out before you buy anything every guitar store Ive been to has been totally ok with just playing some guitars to get a feel for them. ,indieheads,dgkkz6n,6,t5_2zj24

11725089,0,t1_dgowfod,Alright soAthensI went here a number of years ago so I dont remember as well but... I would highly recommend visiting the archaeological museum. Theres a lot of really cool stuff on display there and I think its just well curated.  If I recall correctly its a short hike to get up to the acropolis and it was really beautiful especially at night.  The Plaka the main tourist area has some sights worth seeing but the restaurants and stuff are kinda expensive. Though definitely try the baklava in the Plaka.Rome I cant stress enough that its important in Rome to go outside the tourist zones if you can. The Colisseum and the likes are totally worth seeing but leave those areas once youre done Two tourists attractions I loved were the Pantheon the dome looks like it was constructed by goddamn aliens and Castel Santangelo really big castle. I also reccomend the Bone Church which is kinda eerie. My favorite was the sistine chapel though. The Michelangelo art is absolutely fucking mindblowing. It is nothing short of a must The transportation system is kind of confusinglike tickets only last for  minutes or something like that. I reccomend looking into getting a tourist pass. Try to find a place where you can get fresh meats and cheese and have a picnic in a park.Venice I think the best thing to do in Venice is island hopping. What I mean is that Venice is split up between different islands all with their own attitudes. My favorite is Burano which is like a smurf cartoon village. The water smells kinda bad...be prepared for that Dont do a gondola ride theyre expensive tourist traps The Doges palace is friggin awesome Consider a day trip to Verona if you have the timeHaha...now onto Prague London and Amsterdam I visited these places while studying abroad without my parents so I can speak on some of the debaucheryPrague I literally cried at how beautiful the views were when walking across the Charles Bridge. Its a once in a lifetime experience. Pay the full ticket price to tour Prague Castle I promise you its worth the money. Pretty much every place that asks for an admission fee is very fair and worth it. Do a walk up to Prague castle the views from the hills are beautiful and youll pass the John Lennon wall. The city is very affordable. Czech food is very delicious as well and Czech beer is great. I like this place and this With Prague theres cheap beer everywhere but the Ice Bar I hear is pretty cool in Praguedidnt go there.London Yeah people are assuredly NOT underestimating how freaking expensive this city is. Be prepared to spend some SERIOUS cash here. The tube is crazy expensivetry to walk when you can and get an Oyster Card. I toured the Parliament and I loved it being a huge Anglophile and poli sci major. That was my splurge pounds to get in. Dont expect to be able to tour the Parliament Tower of London Westminster all unless you have big bucks. DEFINITELY try Indian food people are not kidding. I went here Light years ahead of any Indian Ive had in the US. The South Bank area also has a really cool street market but not sure if thats only because I was there on a Saturday. I cannot recommend the Imperial War Museum more highly. Its FREE and the World War I exhibit is the best Ive seen in any museum. Seeing the changing of the guards is another fun free thing to do. I went on the London pub crawl and had a great time. Its the first result if you Google it.Amsterdam Try to buy a ticket ahead of time but the Anne Frank museum as sad as it may be is worth it. Not too expensive either. The Amsterdam sign...eh whatever. Walk along the canals as much as possible really just a beautiful city. If youre with friends honestly walking through the red light district is fucking hilarious...if you have an immature sense of humor like me.  Honestly....theres pot stores everywhere. Theyre all one in the same. Be careful though the stuff can be strong. I had a brownie but it was surprisingly mild. I liked this club and this one.  Stroopwafels are the shit.,indieheads,dgp2i5j,4,t5_2zj24

11759860,0,t1_dgd5th4,It is their choice and they certainly dont owe their fans any particular setlist. I think its commendable that they play songs like Creep and Karma Police at so many shows presumably in part because theyre audience pleasers. The point I was trying to make is that the setlist may explain why some fans report the audience being lower energy. Its speculation on my part based on my own anecdotal experience.,indieheads,dgt0d8d,1,t5_2zj24

11779402,0,t1_dgv58o3,speaking as an Asian dude its always seemed like white people find it more offensive than actual Asians. Certainly its an outdated term and Id rather be called an AsianCanadian and I get WHY its a bit of a skeezy term with its implications of asian exoticism but Im also not going to go up in arms over the term if its used like I would if someone called me a chink ,indieheads,dgv8e0m,42,t5_2zj24
