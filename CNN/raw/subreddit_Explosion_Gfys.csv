4044940,0,t1_crh868x,Eizo Nomura was  m away from the Hiroshima ground zero and survived.Its all a question of how much material of which mechanical and radiation shielding ability is between you and the blast.During one test  cm graphitecoated steel balls were placed  m away from a . kt device and survived with only . mm of surface graphite ablation.Granted a human is not a graphitecoated steel ball. But you see my point.,Explosion_Gfys,crhcqlq,3,t5_33wpi

4337537,0,t1_csekajx,Kamikazes were just Imperial Japanese aircraft that were carrying a bomb on a hard point and if possible some more explosives inside the aircraft. The explosion is actually from the munitions aboard the John Burke detonating simultaneously from the fire caused by the kamikaze. It was an ammunition transport ship I believe was headed towards Okinawa. ,Explosion_Gfys,csekjbw,5,t5_33wpi
