1793059,0,t1_ck50trk,Letter is right. Its a small slanted  placed at the edge of the word. Maybe it was a Gregg Simplified thing? Wouldnt expect it to be hard to find. I mostly use it for my nightly journal and for taking notes at work. ,shorthand,ck55ygs,3,t5_2u0w5
2578368,0,t1_cmv2idr,Viele thanks! That is interessant. I wonder if there is some way we can get news programs in the US to show a shorthand demonstration occasionally. There are certain times of the year when very little news is happening and they need filler material. I will think about this for a while.,shorthand,cmv4pug,2,t5_2u0w5
3764188,0,t3_33ii0w,Edit Added the last sentence of the first paragraph to make my point a little clearer than it was. Nothing has been taken out or otherwise changed.I doubt theres a direct connection. Possibly Gregg knew about the Major system but he neednt have Gregg Shorthand wasnt the first such system to use these groupings and the first may not have come from Major either. They likely all share structures because they are trying to solve similar problemsreducing the English language to a small number of naturally ordered symbolseven though shorthand and mnemonic systems ultimately have different purposes.Almost all phonetic systems of shorthand share this structure because these are the consonant sounds of most English dialects. Some consonants like ch and j are not simple sounds but combinations of two others. Theyre just frequent enough to take their own shapes.The voiced and unvoiced variants t and d s and z etc. are naturally grouped together in both Gregg and the Major system because theyre cognates. The S and Z sounds are produced in the same fashion when spoken except the vocal chords vibrate when making a Z but dont with an S.It is interesting that neither Gregg nor the Major system distinguish between voiced th as in this and unvoiced th as in thing but many shorthand systems do the same for the sake of simplicity. We dont distinguish between these sounds in written English so why introduce a new complication for learners of shorthand or the Major system?Gregg also doesnt distinguish between S and Z but thats only natural as well as the sound Z is almost always written with an s in English. See days means rims does fends reason etc.If you look through other shorthand systems youll find much the same groupings. Pitmans Phonography came before Gregg even littleknown systems that came after it like this one out of Pittsburgh did the same.It would be interesting if the Major system grouped vowels in the same odd way that Gregg does as Gregg doesnt precisely follow English phonology there. For instance having the long and short cognate vowel sounds in grate and bet separated from each other. But it looks like there was little use for vowels in the Major system except for the semivowels which are commonly called consonants.Thank you for pointing out the Major system to me howeverI hadnt seen it before and will read into it!,shorthand,cqlcgg0,2,t5_2u0w5

10622126,0,t3_5rzi59,Thanks for the followup and the great sequence of images. Nice!This thing you wrote over in rneography was very interesting to megt After figuring it out I was talking to a coworker at the coffee shop and the person who wrote it overheard us. Apparently she started journaling in this text months ago and left a note for whatever reason. I just happened upon it right after and here we are.Wish I had studied psychology in school so I would know how to classify this leaving a cryptic note for a random somebody to find behavior.,shorthand,ddblb3k,5,t5_2u0w5
11063733,0,t1_dem1lkt,Once you know the grammar flawlessly you should be able to write comfortably at wpm. Then you can start working on speedAs a rule of thumb for every  wpm increase you should put in  hours of work. That doesnt mean you should sit curved on your desk for a large amount of time while on public transportation while walking look at the world around you and practice the outlines in your head drill them as you would do on paper.  That way you can practice on idle time.I stress that speed exercises and dictations should be had only when grammar is fully mastered otherwise you will never be sure on which outlines to pick and you will waste time.Correctness and clearness before speed.,shorthand,dem21qw,2,t5_2u0w5
