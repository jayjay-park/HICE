Dopesmoker is a really heavy piece of music and its true that some people just dont like it. If you want to give Sleep another chance try their  Album Holy Mountain which is their best record by far.

2752567,0,t1_cngte2x,A Night At The Opera The one with Bohemian Rhapsody is their best on my top  list. Their first album which is where Son amp Daughter comes from has a lot of religous themes in it and is more straight forward and lighter then the following. Queen II is where you start getting a lot of prog and dark themes longer songs with more of a story  not quite a concept album but close. Sheer Heart Attack is a little more raido friendly a lot of speed but the songs are shorter and less prog.A Night At The Opera amp A Day At The Races both bring back the big sound and showmanship that the band is known for. Their biggest hits were off of these two. Great stories jumps all over the place as far as sound and style you cant label these albums under anything as there are so many changes between tracks. Prog is back but so is ragtime acoustic soul a capella etc.News of The World Jazz amp The Game are their era of stadium rock. Their style begins to be more uniform still belting out great songs but not nearly as varied as the previous few records. Heres where youve got We Will Rock You We Are The Champions Another One Bites The Dust their big fuckall songs that everyone knows. Gone is most of the prog and hard rock reigns supreme.After The Game the band moves into a soft rockpop direction. This later era is their worst there still are some good tracks here and there but its all radio rock amp pop. Flash Gordon is a soundtrack album so not much there. Hot Space has Under Pressure with David Bowie later sampled by Vanilla Ice under controversy. The Works had Radio GaGa and I Want To Break Free. A Kind of Magic has A Kind of Magic and Friends Will Be Friends. The Miracle has The Invisible Man and Breakthru. Innuendo and Made In Heaven dont have much worth mentioning.Then Freddie Mercury died of AIDS and the band split up. They came back to release The Cosmos Rocks with Paul Rodgers previously with Free and Bad Company singing which wasnt a bad album but isnt a real Queen album. Its more of an altrockeasy listening record. To their credit they didnt call the group Queen instead chose Queen  Paul Rodgers so they were at least nodding in the reverence of what Queen was,stonerrock,cngyepv,2,t5_2quxq
