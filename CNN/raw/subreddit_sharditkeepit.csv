7876243,0,t3_4n6l4g,Oh man. This is actually a Year  weapon that they brought back with the latest update. Shadow Price used to absolutely dominate the Crucible in the early days.  So first a word on Auto Rifles in general. Like most weapon types they fall roughly into three families highImpactlowRoF lowImpacthighRoF and midmid. Any of these families might be more or less dominant than the others depending on what the current balance is as determined by Bungie and their latest round of patches and updates. When people refer to the meta theyre usually referring to the current balance of power among these three archetypes within weapon types as well as the most powerful perks at any given moment.  Sorry if Im overexplaining a bunch of stuff you already know but you said youre a new player so Im playing it safe and assuming youre not totally familiar with some of the philosophy.  Shadow Price falls into the highImpact family which unfortunately is not doing so hot right now. Especially among Auto Rifles lowImpacthighRoF is extremely dominant right now which is why you see so many people drooling over good rolls on Soulstealers Claw or Doctrine of Passing. Midmid guns like Haakons Hatchet also have their adherents here and there but highImpact is the runt of the litter right now. All that said anything can happen with the next patch so if you find a gun you like using you can hang onto it and hope Bungie smiles upon it once more. I have a wellrolled Her Memory also a highImpact AR that Im keeping in my vault.  Now lets look at the perks. Stability is more important on lowImpact models that jump around like a rabbit on cocaine but its still a good stat to push on any AR and Red DotOES will push it up even further. I personally really like Army of One especially in PvE where it will proc more often and can counteract modifiers like Trickle.  Focused Fire is a really interesting perk to see on a weapon thats already highImpact. Im not sure anyone has done an analysis of FF post.. to see if it raises or lowers overall DPS on a given archetype but preupdate it actually hurt your overall damage output. Potentially you could use this on bosses and yellowbars to land more crit shots and melt their health down. Shadow Price already has one of the highest ranges available on an AR so if your playstyle favors hanging back and attacking from cover this could be a solid choice. However its basically a worthless perk in PvP where you really want higher RoF.Overall I think this could be a solid and fun choice for daytoday PvE activities Daily Heroics Strikes even CoE for the precision kills. But I wouldnt take this into the Crucible unless I wanted to have a really bad day.,sharditkeepit,d41d1xc,4,t5_389nk

Injection could be very useful for PvP if you dont mind the range hit it will give a bit more stability and speed up weapon stowdraw times as well as scoping in.  Counterbalance is the perk I prefer on all my autos regardless of type simply because it allows you to disregard most stability needs for the auto and focus on range.

All three barrel perks increase the Impact just enough to reduce the TtK to something insane like . seconds.

9639748,0,t3_5d2s6x,If you can handle using the weapon without Counterbalance then these both have potential but it depends on if youre only comfortable using the weapon with Braced Frame or dont mind Perfect Balance only.If youre most comfortable with Braced Frame roll  is the obvious choice. While Braced Frame and Feather Mag together cripple your magazine size down to a whopping  bullets its still an amusing pairing. Feeding Frenzy is fantastic for maintaining uptime. I would not recommend the usage of Feather Mag with Braced Frame.If you dont mind sticking to just Perfect Balance roll  has more power. Perfect Balance Appended Magazine and Hidden Hand or Outlaw is a very good suite of perks giving you enough bullets to v with ease.If you find the weapon uncomfortable to use without Counterbalance stick to the vendor roll.,sharditkeepit,da1apqn,2,t5_389nk
9710769,0,t1_daa1k0y,With Outlaw Rifled and Hidden Hand this is a solid roll. I would keep it and use whichever one feels better to you. Personally Id probably want the bit of extra range but it would depend on how much effect I noticed from Hidden Hand.,sharditkeepit,daa27nq,1,t5_389nk
9731621,0,t1_dabpc4m,It comes down to preference really.

10056019,0,t1_dbi924d,Since you bring up Icarus as well Ill chime in Just like these guys said already you live and die by the range stat.Hidden Hand is a flat increase to AA but increased range does it better because of the way AA drops off at range. You can really feel this on your sniper at extreme ranges.Icarus decreases the airborne accuracy penalty but increased range does it better because it drastically narrows your starting accuracy cone.There may come a day when bloom is replaced by steep damage falloff but until then unfortunately a maxrange HC with underdog and relentless tracker is better than literally anything with no range perk.,sharditkeepit,dbibnum,1,t5_389nk

10623810,0,t3_5s0za4,Depending on your red dot choice. Theres OES OAS ORS ORS and ORES that will change my opinion. For either PvP is not really favourable for autos. But Id run SureShot or the Red Dot depending on what it isRodeoPerfect BalanceHidden Hand. Rodeo doesnt do anything so thats a waste. Perfect balance and hidden hand both make this a very crispy and easy shot within its effective range. If you like autos for PvP theres the unbent tree doctrine or even Genesis Chain if the fastest rate of fire isnt your style. It really doesnt have anything stand outishFor the second Id run QuickDraw Or the red dot depending on what it isPersistenceRifledCounterbalance. Persistence only comes into effect if youre holding down the trigger not extremely helpful in PvP. Id say this is best for PvE but it doesnt have anything like grenadierlife supportetc. It will be okay if you like using auto rifles. Youre better off using Zhalo if you really like autos for PvE.TLDR hatchet  for PvP hatchet  for PvE although there are much better options.,sharditkeepit,ddbrjxk,1,t5_389nk

10749949,0,t3_5tt0nd,Pretty good. I dont know how badly ER messes up triple tap because of how Explosive Rounds eat precision hits which doesnt proc firefly in some cases.

10964369,0,t3_5wkgg3,IMO this gun is very much outclassed by the SUROS DIS. It is in the VERY fast rate of fire archetype for scouts so stability is a must. Id say use hand laid stock over explosive rounds. Even though its PvE you still want stability otherwise your shots will be in the sky. Im not sure how much reactive reload helps with damage. But you might be better off with the Angels Advocate purely because it hits harder.,sharditkeepit,deawbhi,1,t5_389nk

That way you pump up your Range and Stability as much as you can to engage at the right distance.
