10037775,0,t3_5jamir,one of the best is the second time Nick Lowes on and he mentions my wifes relations being the people depicted in the album art of his holiday LP. Scott throws in a very quiet my wife and no one acknowledges it and then just does it again slightly louder and Mantzoukas and Lowe who have continued the conversation barely hold in their laughter Lowe says Im so glad to hear that which is a pretty hilarious response. also during the opening monologue of one of the Suicide House eps. Scott its beens himself which wasnt really overlooked by other guest because they werent on mic but the same vibe his monologue quickly moves back into shlocky spooky mode occurs. very funny. the Suicide House eps are great for this because Daly and Gelman seem to come in with no plan whatsoever and just act as offthewall as possible. i normally dont dig that i feel like a lot of the more recent and younger guests get sucked into trying to just be as outlandish as possible and it does not go well but those two badgering each other and badgering Scott produces a lot of funny stuff whereas otherwise it would tend to go offtherails. same goes for the GilGeorge episodes. Krolls brain works so fast that its almost hard to believe i just relistened to the Fabrice Fabrice spoken word piece that he made up on the spotwow. its pretty awesome how in character they stay but how much wacky shit they come up with probably the two guests who are best at that. so anyways the point being that they have a lot of great lines that i think just quickly get lost in the flow. on the Mirman ep. George saying he was a short story professor at SUNYYonkersgo Zebras! had me rolling. also love a couple minutes later when George gets really mad at Scott for confusing Bernie Goetz and David Berkowitz and calls him ignorant and poor several times before saying that this isnt a dig at you though and Scott replies well this is actually seems like a textbook dig at me. there are a couple others that were overlooked by conversation participants that im struggling to think of although if you just want underrated lines search the forum for similar past posts or look at my history i only use this account for CBB posting and Marxism stuff so it should be easy to find. usually any episode with PFT is good for this because he spits out stuff so fast and sardonically that other guests inevitably miss some stuff. also any Horatio episodesi love his MO where he just comes up with intrinsically funny ideas and lets the improv flow from that so a lot of his lines arent super polished and they tend to not become gimmickswhich i like but which makes them less popular. there are definitely a couple Andy Daly ones like this i recall one episode where hes on as Don diMello and someone mentions the infamous yelling fire in a theater scenario and DD immediately retorts with fire in a theater? bring out the girls! i recall people laughing at it but maybe not as hard as you would expect because it was kind of a distraction its all in the delivery but damn its funny. think it might be a Patton Oswalt ep.i did a bigger post here ,comedybangbang,dbfy5ia,5,t5_2vznk

They havent. Honestly ask yourself what you thought about last years shows? There are plenty of good episodes yes but those mediocre or bad episodes are pretty boring. To me it was things like WYR and the other games that would really save those lesser episodes and even bump some good episodes into being great episodes. I agree with you that it was kind of used as a time filler but it was also to pump up the show when segments are stagnating. To me there have been so many bits over the last year that just kind of fizzle out towards the end and WYR would have really saved those episodes from that. ,comedybangbang,de1rxil,4,t5_2vznk
10876048,0,t1_de0r2qx,That segment he did with her just pissed me the fuck off and honestly I dont listen to the show as avidly since hes killed off WYR and especially after that episode.

11564893,1,t3_651m5r,Oh I had been avoiding CBB for a while now because Scott perpetually steps on peoples bits to be the PC police. I was mad at Scott for that but seeing how shitty the people are on the forums about this shit maybe it is just coming from them that he does this. Its weird too because when he does get all PC about shit he seems in a real tizzy like someone trying to cover up a mistake or something like that.Do people not remember that CBB used to be really fucking dirty? That it would make jokes about a lot of sort of taboo stuff including incest rape racism bestiality and misogyny. I mean one of the best and funniest characters on there Dom DeMillo is based all around physically abusing women then selling them into sex slavery. But it is funny as fuck in its absurdity. IMO the listenership has become too sensitive and Scott depserate to hang on to listeners is playing to them and not what actually made the show great which was being that kind of show. The show only feels like that kind of show when Lauren Thomas Jason or Andy Daily are on. Without them this show has become so very vanilla. ,comedybangbang,dg6vwef,-2,t5_2vznk

I know Kulap has said that she was backing off of acting to create and own shows. ,comedybangbang,dgkp8w6,1,t5_2vznk
