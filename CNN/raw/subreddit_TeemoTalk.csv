I have gotten  off in the time LB got her distortion by hitting minions beforehand when she came to fight me due to splitpushing and she did near nothing to me but alot of people enjoy playing Teemo more teamfight oriented rather than splitpush oriented.

7757466,0,t1_d3nxt00,Just because you arent as wise as the great Leviathan doesnt make you retarded. You could be but not necessarily. You might be high though. I prefer tripping on shrooms while being a Teemo main.I like the second answer delineating between terms in this link. So for league you have hyper carries with infinite scaling like Nasus and Veigar. These champions have some distinct disadvantages that make them counterable. Teemo is definitely not one of these without the old feral flare infinite scaling item.Notice the huge jump at . You have champions like Vayne who to a certain extent is a very hard carry. A late game monster. That is because he has true damage that scales with AS. Other champions might just scale hard because item combinations give them a plethora of stats that make them hard to counter. Notice the  percentage point difference between win rate in early game versus late with a large jump after  items because enemies have gotten tanky while Vayne has gotten a lot of his carry items. These champions are hyper carries only if they reach late game.  You also have champions that can snowball hard like Irelia who will be seeing more play next patch. Irelia has dashes true damage and CC in her kit. Very powerful. Also Olaf because of his berserker mechanic and ability to shrug off CC.These champions are early game monsters that if given the chance to snowball have mechanics that allow them to shut down the game before major item spikes. These champions are technically extreme examples of champions with strong early games but weak late games. However if they win the game before the late game they are examples of hyper carries. I would say Teemo slightly fits into categories  and . For  I find my Teemo build reaches an extreme level of dominance when I have runaans t boots hextech and mallet. This is because I have an extreme amount of MS AS AP AD HP and a slow on AA. For  Teemo can be soooooooooooooooo oppressive if he gets ahead. I remember one time in mid I rushed gunblade with its  second slow and just waited for enemy lux to get in lane. She couldnt even get within range to get exp from creeps because Id use gunblade active then kill her. She tilted off the face of oblivion and her team tore her apart. I remember another game where Darius couldnt even cs under tower because I just had so much poke. I ended laning phase really early with about  cs to his low s while he literally begged for mercy in all chat. I hate how frequently I get enemies to surrender at  because I end up just spending forever out of game.Teemo can be oppressive because shrooms are a zoning mechanism with unlimited range. Other champions like Heimerdinger have a range on their zoning mechanics. While champions like Zyra have zoning mechanics that are only slightly useful when left without her working around them. If the enemy jungler pink wards river bush you likely will have shrooms out of range in lane. So they can avoid some but youll have time to get away before they can get to you because theyll trip over others. Sweepers works to tell the jungler where shrooms are and disable them for  seconds but if you have the MS you can rush to place them deep in river without missing cs. This will allow him to disable and destroy shrooms if he wants but youll still be notified of an incoming gank. A Teemo that has snowballed hard can pretty much only die if they make a big mistake like getting cocky or not having map awareness. This allows an early lead to become overpowering.So Teemo can in some circumstances be a hyper carry just because of his lane dominance versus some champions and his ability to really leverage snowballing because of shrooms zone of control. Thats why I never use shrooms for wave clearing. Ill litter the entire lane and river with shrooms out of reach of minions. Even if jungler manages to catch me off guard with sweepers my lane opponent might still trip on a shroom so itll be v for a bit.Teemos  item spike is not as good as other champions  item spikem in my opinion. Id say Teemo is most dominant at the  item spike because th and th items are usually situational and not as synergistic as his first . If the enemy has a lot of hp tanks great I can take botrk th. If they have a top of AP great I can take wits end. But it is usually not that clear of an advantage and my th and ths items end up only being moderately useful compared to the first . Thats why trinity force next patch might be so awesome. That item will likely be useful in all circumstances for Teemo meaning his th item might be the only situational item and his power spike will last longer.Teemos advantage is in his bullying and allowing him to pretty much be a full item ahead of his opponents. His win rates by game length show the two main power spikes I mention. Champion.gg shows one spike at  minutes which is normally when I have my  item power spike. Another spike occurs at  to  minute range which is hopefully your  item spike before the enemy reaches their  item spike. After  minutes though unless your team has been extremely oppressive you can expect everyone to be  items and that is when Teemos win rate goes down.,TeemoTalk,d3nyquk,3,t5_38i2f

I usually rush mallet but if you face a hard AD match up that is constantly pushing you into tower.. I would suggest you try rush Raptors Cloak from ZZRot  followed by a Seekers Armguard then finish off ZZrot to help you with getting pushed under tower and dived.The goal is not to win lane vs those types of match ups but to survive and stay relevant. Once you get ZZseekers look to continue on your desired build path and finish Zhonyas when you can afford to.Vs hard AP match ups where I failed to get lane dominance ill rush a Spectres Cowl and an abyssal once again just survive and you will remain relevant.If you know its a farm lane its not a bad idea to pick up a cull instead of dorans either.I find tho lifesteal doesnt add up enough to warrant it at early stages of the game I feel its better to get defensive stats such as armor or mr with hp and play to survive while maximizing your cs.edit I am having load of of fun right now with a heavy life steal buildLooks like Mallet gt Runanns gt GunbladegtBorkgtBloodthirster. ,TeemoTalk,d4ynjla,1,t5_38i2f

Winning your lane if they dont expect you to build full AP. But its normally like...Mallet Boots Hextech Hurricane Shiv Infinity Edge but again its all situational.

9442465,0,t3_59yyko,I think the answer is pretty clear cut if were talking about early laning and simply reading through the keystone descriptions should be enough but lets do some math anyways.For our calculations well assume AP quints x. AP scaling blues x.lvl  natural talent mastery .lvl and a dorans ring start giving us AP at lvl  AP less than expected due to the way rounding works with runes and masteries the same discrepancy might be found in other numbers but it shouldnt make much of a difference. I will use AP for my lvl  AP number simply because thats what I actually get in game although it doesnt match just adding the numbers together above due to rounding. We will see soon enough that a few points of AP wont affect the decision.Our main scenario we consider is autoQauto. From there we can discuss situations involving more autos. For lvl  TLD we can just substitute  autos.On ticks and stacks from testing I can say that DFT procs on your q but not your e. So in the combo described above only Q will apply DFT and thus youll get  ticks s. FoB doesnt do damage till you already have stacks. You first auto adds a stack but doesnt apply it same with your Q since it doesnt apply onhit so your only attack that makes use of stacks is your nd auto. Thus  stacks for the scenario.TLD dmg lvl  .AP  dmg at lvl   dmg at lvl DFT dmg   .AP per tick .sassuming  ticks   .AP  dmg at lvl   dmg at lvl FoB dmg .  .lvl per stackassuming  stacks on nd auto  dmg at lvl  dmg at lvl Discussion For this particular scenario FoB is out of the question but well visit it again in a moment. DFT has a slightly better  dmg lvl  than TLD. However TLDs lvl scaling quickly out scales better AP ratio of DFT during laning phase. One would need an additional AP per level for DFT to match the  additional dmg a lvl TLD gains.The reason why DFT is considered on many champions despite the large amount of AP required to match TLD is the lack of cool down on application. There is an s base CD on Q and TLD at lvl  has a s CD. In the most favorable scenario we will be able to do the combo three times. So DFT can apply three times for one TL proc in this situation. This still puts TLD ahead around lvl  and onward but it is important to acknowledge that this scenario is quite idealized since it assumes a very fast pace of harassment. With only two DFT applications lvl  is the point where TLD will pull ahead.FoB becomes more favorable the more auto attacks we add to the equation. An aaQaaaax combo more so an extended trade or all in yields   stack applications which puts FoB quite close to the TLD numbers  vs  at lvl  and  vs  for FoB and TLD respectively. Add in another auto attack or Q adds a stack puts FoB firmly ahead. However with equal damage numbers TLD is ahead in most situations because of magic damage likely being stronger than physical damage point for point. Reasons why this is so are the natural resists of champions armor is naturally higher and the fact that your runesmasteriesbuild are adding magic pen opposed to armor pen.,TeemoTalk,d9cwe2w,2,t5_38i2f

You have to tell your team your intentions tho and make sure they follow on your tactics.There are not many reasons for me to join my team one would be if we are too far ahead and we can finish it asap. If my team is losing and there are no signs of it getting better I may join them until we are ahead again once that happens I go back to split pushing or trying to win asap with my team.It all depends on my team and how they react to my playstyle.

10891248,0,t1_de3ac8f,maybe you can change the rules later on in the series since sidelane minions can easily sway who wins.Maybe do some formula accounting for kills and midlane towers by a certain time?,TeemoTalk,de3csel,1,t5_38i2f

11114019,0,t1_derqg0q,I guess so. I mean at least I dont get one shoted with on hit Teemo. cause you can build stuff like Frozen Mallet  and spirit visage,TeemoTalk,derrjg0,1,t5_38i2f
11200947,0,t3_5zl3yd,GoldenShroomer answered the question very well. The build I would recommend for onhit is as follows Bloodrazor lt FrozenMallet lt Hurricanewits end lt SpiritVisage lt Liandry. The boots are completely up to the enemy comp. And yes this build is for top.,TeemoTalk,df1m38e,1,t5_38i2f

11539453,0,t1_dg3zvrc,Yeah Ive played against a few Lees top since his new skin came out. It seems to be dying off now. I cant poke him because hell just run up throw a stone blade at me and run away as Im slowed by it. I did build a spirit visage against him but it didnt help me much. Thanks for the advice though Ill apply it for when next time I lane against this guy ,TeemoTalk,dg3zz9o,1,t5_38i2f

11640934,0,t3_664czp,I personally dont see why u build nashors  on tanky teemo when you build no ap I understand the stats all work on teemo but the passive is so weak wo Ap. I rather substitute that with a wits end or hurricane depending on what I need. You need atleasr like ap or so to out damage wits end. Give or take. But yes CD is really good on teemo but I prefer other items personally. U mostly use shrooms for vision an map control not for damage when you go tanky variant. An having like a hurricane can help shove lanes really easy then roam and be pretty decent in team fights since ur tanky u can actually get out damage  aoe damage. Plus alot of people like gunblade an hurricane for the massive sustain ull have besides tanky items since all the bolts will heal teemo like  a hit an be unkillable. But otherwise I agree with ur guide an builds. Id never go pure onhit unless ur extremely underestimating the other team an can pull it off. ,TeemoTalk,dgfihmm,2,t5_38i2f
