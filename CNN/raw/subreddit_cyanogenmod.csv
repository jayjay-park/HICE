Last I checked Skype does not use GCM and is thus a huge battery drainer see here If thats not it we really need some more information besides the two images youve posted the SettingsgtBattery list with the apps listed as well as SettingsgtAppsgtRunning. Take the screenshots when the battery is fully drained not after youve recharged as some apps tend to go crazy when youre plugged in messing up the stats.Edit Also check if youve changed anything under SettingsgtPerformance. Messing with the settings there can really drain your battery if you select the wrong setting.

First you have to go about unlocking your devices boot loader. I recommend htcdev.com and follow the directions listed.Next you must flash a custom recovery and IMO clockworkmod is the best one. Once you flashed it make a backup of sense copy a zip for your device off of download.cyanogenmod.com and then format the following respectively  Cache Partition DataFactory reset Dalvik Cache SystemOnce this is done install the zip file using clockworkmod and then you are almost ready to boot.You now have to install gapps so you can use any gapps youd like but I use the zip off of cyanogenmods site just because I havent had any problems with it. After you finished with all these steps you may boot normally! If you have any questions then please ask me.

4161360,0,t3_38b2o1,CyanogenMod has never accepted bug reports on nightlies. nightlies are generated by a machine on a set schedule regardless of code quality. The fact that nightlies complete is an indicator that we havent done anything horribly broken. That being said they are not guaranteed to actually boot be functional not wipe your data etc. The NIGHTLIES regression tracker was started last summer because we realized that we were breaking things in the course of making other things better. We need lastknowngood dates that are accurate and preferably within the last week or so so we know what patches to review that might have broken something. We still dont accept bugdefect reports on nightlies because the manpower needed to dedupetriageetc. would mean at least one clone of me if not two. If we allowed bug reports on nightlies wed get hundreds of reports every time a new device was added hundreds more for every new branch where we hadnt brought forward old features etc. Wed get a dozen reports for every partiallyimplemented feature that took more than one day to patch in. I know its frustrating annoying doesnt make sense or whatever but thats the way it is. Posting here xdadev the google plus community or the cyanogenmod forums are ways you can create noise about bugs that we dont accept reports on. Or you can stay on the M snapshots or otherwise stable releases. And yes cm.m and cmm are planned and would be reportable in the main CYAN bug tracker. ,cyanogenmod,crulsc2,2,t5_2s0tp

4327738,0,t1_csdect7,Wifi calling doesnt negatively affect battery life. It actually has the opposite effect. Connecting to a cell tower for callstext takes considerably more power than using Wifi. Leaving the technical side of things out the best way to explain this simple the farther your information has to travel over the air the more power it will take to get it there. Even when youre not actively making callstext your cell radio is still using power because it constantly will ping towers nearby to maintain an open connection in anticipation of receiving a calltext. By using Wifi calling which also transmits text messages as well you dont need to maintain a connection to a cell tower because everything is flowing through your Wifi connection. This means that your cell radio wont consume power until you disconnect from Wifi which can be a major benefit for those looking for a decent bump on battery life. My HTC One M is getting long in the tooth gt years old! so I had to walk away from cyanogenmod in favor of a Sense based rom that included Wifi calling. Luckily viper rom offers both lollipop . and Wifi calling so I got the best of both worlds! Glad youre happy with your experience with cyanogen.
