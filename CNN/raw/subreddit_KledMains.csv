8429445,0,t3_4v33eo,Ive played him like  games on pbe now Im not too sure what to build either but a build Ive been going is tiamat  phage  black cleaver  titanic hydra  steraks gage  deadmans plate  guardians angel and movement boots or mercury threads somewhere in the build probably after phage. Also an item Ive been looking into is Frozen Mallet the sticking potential is really good and it synergises well with black cleaver as well as titanic hydra. I tend to build Frozen Mallet if I dont need the Steraks passive.,KledMains,d5v7zmr,2,t5_3fdck
8466416,0,t3_4vnk2z,im actually leaning toward warlords the extra lifesteal seems to help a ton on glass cannon style builds and allows you to put off getting real lifesteal items till late game. though i think grasp would be really strong on tankier builds because of his really high base hp and a building something like bc or triforce tiamat  tank items  would make that health damage pretty high from graspi really like taking Warmogs on him fervor seems good against juggernauts like garen or darius who cant run from you and you can sit on them autoing em to death. ,KledMains,d5zu8zt,2,t5_3fdck

9497251,0,t3_5au9l8,Man i love warlords on kled. Those close duels even in a v situation help me kill em all. Walords is the best mastery ive ever used. And dismounted kled lacks sustain so thats why warlords is here for him. I survived a darius passive and ignite with it,KledMains,d9jql9o,1,t5_3fdck
9719897,0,t3_5ebdx2,Quite the coincidence you posted this today last night I grinded through a few normals before Im away on holidayUS Thanksgiving and this was the build I was testing and I was so damn pleased with it I believe it will be my go to when I get back for the preseason Ranked climb. I was alternating between Warlords and Fervor and think both work great for the build depending on your lane match up but I agree once Fervor buffs and CotC nerfs come through Fervor will def be the best choice. Just completing Ravenous gives you a gigantic boost in dueling power compared to BC or Titanic first and building Deaths Dance after RH and BC just felt so right for his kit. I was going Locket afterwards for the crazy shielding and then into GA but having both doesnt seem super great honestly will probably try your Build of RHgtBCgtBootsgtDDgtGAgtVisageMawSteraks.Do you find that the lul between BC and DD makes you feel kinda weak? When I was using it I was definitely missing the tankiness from Titanic and often found I had to carefully consider engages and felt more vulnerable when splitting. Also what do you think of Warlords? I tried it versus a Fiora and Mundo and found it great for those lanes then tried Fervor against Fiora later and felt weaker than when I had WarlordsDorans with Vampirism. Also why AS runes? He has nutso AD scalings you find losing out on some AD early isnt that big of a deal?,KledMains,dab6sx5,1,t5_3fdck
10081530,0,t3_5k64ub,Contrary to what Lupxel said im always going with dorans simply because i value the health on it. Also im playing super aggressive early game and dorans is simply better if u plan on going allin very soon.,KledMains,dbln5yj,2,t5_3fdck

11096130,0,t1_deporro,Perhaps although Im not sure if it would have too much impact at this stage of the game. Although the attack speed and hp damage is nice Im not convinced the active is good enough late game.  I also feel like the CDR and extra AD are a much stronger set of stats. Its more of a bruiser item imo which is what kled wants to be later on into the game. I  personally feel like he needs to be more of a frontline than a pure dmg threat. Fervour BC and TH should easily be enough to kill whoever you need if you can get into them.It could work in the first two items and will need a bit more testing but Im not yet convinced.,KledMains,depqj2r,2,t5_3fdck
11220621,0,t3_605pme,Its a riskier item choice but the pay off can be potentially high...Here is some food for thought Deaths Dance gives  vamp from all physical damage. New Botrk gives  life steal.  points in Vampirism gives you  life steal. You auto now does  life steal and th hit from W benefits from Deaths Dance. Extra Top it off with a Visage and now you have  life steal .  .  .  .Now its an entirely feast or famine build in lane. You will get nuked a lot more easily in team fights and you will have to either delayforgo TiamatHydraBC or other defensive items to achieve this. But if you ever get there there are very few champions that can solo stop you from splitting and shoving down an entire lane.,KledMains,df3udcx,1,t5_3fdck
11423471,0,t1_dfqty9y,If hes smart hell stun you when w is active so you cant get all your damage out and lose the trade and pressure in lane. ,KledMains,dfqu7ts,1,t5_3fdck
