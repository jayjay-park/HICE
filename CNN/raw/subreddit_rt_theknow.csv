The Know Hands On with Halo  Guardians Multiplayer  The KnowAccording to Google clickbait is content especially that of a sensational or provocative nature whose main purpose is to attract attention and draw visitors to a particular web page.So how many of these titles are sensational or provocative? Id say that the majority are worded in such a way to make you want to click on them... And that is fine because that gets more people to watch their content. And every content creator wants more people to watch their content. It isnt a mystery why most of the channels most popular videos have enticing headlines newspapers and T.V news have been doing this sort of thing for years. Why? Because it works.A title is meant to grab attention that is literally their purpose. Judge videos on content not on titles and thumbnails. If you really cant stand them dont watch unsubscribe if you really want to not see these kinds of ultimate clickbait titles and pics.TLDR  If you dont like their naming convention you dont have to watch their videos.,rt_theknow,ct65x4w,0,t5_34nig
