250903,0,t3_1wj9qg,As for places you may have left out dont miss Wieliczka salt mine and Krakw is a great culture destination so make sure youll allocate some time there.If you have problem scheduling I highly recommend Furkot and not just because I wrote parts of it . You can export your trip from Google Maps to KML and import into Furkot. That should let you schedule stop on the way and give you an idea how much youll be driving everyday. You should also be able to find campsites on your route.Dos and donts  not really that much different from Western Europe. People smile less but dont take it personally they are still very friendly and they will go out  of their way to help you. In case of language problems try talk to someone younger. Higher chance theyll speak English.Thing to keep in mind all the countries on your way are in Schengen Zone  so no real borders to cross but Poland Czech Republic in Hungary still use their own currencies.

1182361,0,t1_ci2iv9m,i have used both. while i am happy for the  albeit  uncomfortable experience of traveling greyhound i will probably never travel long distance with them again. i travelled from connecticut to oregon then from los angeles back to connecticut by greyhound busses. i booked in advance it was maybe  for each trip at the time years agonow it looks to be a bit more expensive. since i was to do some backpackingcamping once i got to oregon i had a camp stove on me. my intention was to use that to cook somewhat nourishing meals during my sometimes hourslong layovers. this it turned out was impossible for me. we were either in a seedy area in cities or did not stop for long enough. and every time we changed busses i had to quickly get my things and get in line for the next bus even if it would board for several hours so i could hopefully find a somewhat decent seat. Instead the busses make pit stops at convenience stores and fast food places. i dont eat fast food so i practically survived on trail mix pretzels and jerky for  days. it was an uncomfortable experience. the rail pass on the other hand was great. way more comfortable spacious i only had to share a seat with people when we approached LA and Chicago and maybe one or two other major cities. the key is to pack a cooler with food and booze because the food there will get expensive and the booze definitely will. ,roadtrip,ci2mvjz,2,t5_2r413

1486094,0,t3_2b5oee,I do these drives repeatedly every summer. Id avoid I. At least once youre in Ohio.Definitely take I across PA from NYC to avoid the PA Turnpike trucks and tolls but when you cross into Ohio where I and I kiss take I to I and head southwest to Columbus. At Columbus pickup I which is a much better drive west. Youll also avoid all the tolls on I west of PA and avoid Chicago. I is free west of PA except a . section of the Kansas Turnpike. Theres not a huge amount of stuff to see on either route before reaching the Rockies. If youre looking to see stuff while traveling across that section of the country Id actually go up north and take I and see stuff in South Dakota before cutting down but that will add a couple days to your trip rather than hours.If youre on I Id stop at the Herbert Hoover presidential birthplace in Iowa. The museum is sort of small but they have a reasonably goodsized preservationrecreation of a small midwest town from the turn of the last century that is interesting to walk around and free.Along I you have the St. Louis Arch Missouri Botanical Gardens St. Louis and a really bizarro place called The City Museum in St. Louis. In Kansas theres an interesting salt mine you can tour in Hutchinson along with a good space museum that has a lot of Russian stuff. Hutchinson is a good hour off I but it might be a good place if youre there around the end of day  anyway. If youre willing to add a couple days and take the I route theres plenty of good stuff to see in the Black Hills in SD plus Devils Tower in WY before turning south to CO.,roadtrip,cj2k23x,3,t5_2r413

1802858,0,t3_2eukrc,Ive stayed at a campground called Slick Rock right at the edge of Moab before and it was quite nice.  Sounds like you may be looking for something a little more in the wilderness though.  Slick Rock is a good place to take a shower if youre wanting one though.  You cannot just pull over anywhere in a NP and camp.  You can get a wilderness permit to backpack and leave your car in a lot though.  I recommend hitting up Mesa Verde if you head towards Durango. Do yourself a favor and get an Annual Parks Pass that will get you into any NPS area initial cost is ? Maybe ? I dont quite remember.  Its well worth the cost if youre into National Parks.  Source I live in Denver and use mine at least once a month. It only takes about four trips into a NP to get your moneys worth.Not sure about the specifics of your route but if you find yourself heading to Denver from SW CO I recommend taking the highway up to Montrose and hitting up the Black Canyon.  Then take the HW  and HW  to Colorado Springs.  From there its an hour trek up I to Denver.  Not sure if this fits in your schedule but Ive enjoyed this route in the past. ,roadtrip,ck6efsk,1,t5_2r413

2436594,0,t1_cmcuq07,Funny enough theyre calling for snow tomorrow night but its pretty early for it. Same with Christmas. Ive seen maybe  or white christmases in my  years. Snow is usually a JanuaryFebruary thing.  The best advice for driving in snow is to not do it but generally the highwaysinterstates have the biggest priority so theyre usually the safest unless you happen to be driving right in the middle of the storm. Anyway metro what we call our subway system is a good way of getting in and around the city. But to take best advantage of that Id say youll want to stay within walking distance to a station. To find out if thats the case you can check a map or check the hotels directions. If it includes walking directions then youre golden. If youre really just trying to do the tourist thing I say stay downtown in the NW quadrant of the city. Youll likely have to pay for parking but  there are options but overall thats better than commuting from one of the end stations which can mean  minutes just getting to sites. There are a few hotels in Arlington across the river from the Mall that are close to metro and have free parking they are the Americana and the Days Inn Rosslyn. They arent fancy places but theyre perfectly fine and you cant beat the price for the area youre staying in.

Super bonus the cover over the spare tire is actually a built in folding table! Roomy enough to sleep in or to store lots of camping gear. Extremely reliable. Decent gas milage.

6043801,0,t1_cybu4zx,You wont make it less driving unless you shorten the route you want to take. Driving from one coast to another is a big deal in the US. Its large. You cover a lot of land and that means a lot of driving. A lot. If you want to go from coast to coast youre just going to have to accept driving a lot without having much time to explore especially at having only ish days. Also some other things to be thinking of. Its going to be hot when you take this trip especially where youre going. Be prepared for that. Itll be hot and humid on the east and dry but hotter in the southwest. Also staying for free takes a decent amount of planning. I like to camp when traveling and sometimes it can be hard to find a camping location near where Im ending up on that particular day. Make sure you break your trips up day to day and ensure you know where you are probably going to stay for each night. Winging it can work but you might end up sleeping in your car a lot because of that. ,roadtrip,cybumiu,1,t5_2r413

6818336,0,t3_492hux,I did my first solo trip last year.  I did a few portions of night driving and wish I hadnt.  For me one of the biggest parts of the trip was seeing all the cool new landscapes that were completely foreign to me.  Dont push your miles per day unless you are crunched for time.I kept a cooler with some snack and sandwich fixings and would pull over at a picnic area or park with a sweet view for food usually.  Sandwiches are easy to put together little to no dirty dishes and you can customize them!  Applesauce string cheese crackers all make good snacks.  Yogurt can be refreshing if you do have a cooler with you.Consider using paper maps or atlases if you intend to do any impromptu countrywandering in between any stops you may have planned already.  My favorite parts of the trip were when I stayed off the interstate and got on smaller roads either US or county routes.  I felt must more connected with the countryside I was passing through this way.  Interstates are monotonous and tend to block out a lot of the landscape.  I used them primarily to get through the midwest portions because lets be honest if youre going to go straight for a ton of miles you might as well go faster.Where are you planning to drive on your trip?,roadtrip,d0p5nku,1,t5_2r413

7143583,0,t3_4dcs4d,Ive driven to Amsterdam and back from the UK before cant remember how much the ferry costs though as I was splitting with  people. Its significantly cheaper not at peak times though if thats an option. I used Dunkirk rather than Calais as my port in France as its closer to Amsterdam and is a far less busy port. The pay off is a longer journey but I preferred that as it gives a rest from driving and you can eat etc on the ferry food is more expensive on there though just like in an airport.  This was  years ago and the migrant situation in Calais has heated up a bit so I would suspect there are longer queues and more security now than even before. At Dunkirk you can more or less drive onto the ship. Also allow for time to get around Brussels  the traffic on the ring road is awful if you get the wrong time of day and Ive nearly missed a ferry twice because of it. The main motorway is a pretty easy drive though so I wouldnt worry too much. In terms of fuel make sure to look if its cheaper in the UK or France or even Belgium at the time of travel  as the price can vary  important if you need to return the car with a full tank and its a guzzly car. Sorry to provide no help about car rental but I have no experience in that as Ive always taken my own. ,roadtrip,d1q5eha,2,t5_2r413

7814842,0,t1_d3udzuq,Glad to see that you want to keep Badlands.  Its one of those parks where you can do the scenic drive and maybe a short hike recommend Notch Trail and only spend a few hours there on your way somewhere else or you can get lost in solitude for a couple of days backpacking through Sage Creek Wilderness.  Its great to see a sunset or sunrise there or the clear night skies.I dont know so much about getting burned out on canyons.  Its surprising how completely different they are.  Getting burned out on a heavy itinerary though is possible  Is Devils Tower worth it?  I think so.  Its one of those iconic places.  Its also a nice break to stretch your legs with an easy walk around the entire thing.  However if you cant afford to spend two or three hours there then dont worry about missing it.You wont have crowds on Iron Mountain Rd but it can get pretty busy and traffic does back up sometimes on those only one way at a time tunnels but if you get on it early in the morning or later in the evening its not so bad and yes you can get some nicely framed pictures of Mt Rushmore without going to Mt Rushmore.  The place in person is pretty impressive but Ive gotten to like the seeing it from the road.  BTW Custer SP is on par with a lot of national parks and has historic lodges.  Try to avoid going through the Black Hills area during the Sturgis bike rally usually first week of August unless you like seeing lots and lots of motorcycles.  It is quite impressive but you cant find any place to stay for miles around.Since youve got Monument Valley back on the list and said cost isnt a consideration check out The View  I assume youre not camping but the toughest challenge on a trip to these popular national parks will be finding camping or lodging.,roadtrip,d3ugaqi,2,t5_2r413

At the very least swing through Badlands NP on your way to Mt Rushmore.  Spearfish Canyon Rd is nice and scenic but I would also consider Iron Mountain Rd and Needles Highway in Custer SP.  Other sites in the Black Hills area are Wind Cave NP Jewel Cave NM Crazy Horse Monument.Swing up to Devils Tower NM if you have time while going from the Black Hills to Grand Teton. It messes up your planned route for Grand TetonYellowstone but I would strongly consider changing it to go either Bighorn Byway or Cloud Peak Skyway across the Bighorns and then preferably the Beartooth Scenic Highway or alternatively Chief St Joseph Scenic Byway into YellowstoneGrand Teton.The campgrounds in a number of the national parks will be completely full before noon sometimes earlier.  Make sure youre familiar with other options like nearby National Forest campgrounds if you plan on camping.,roadtrip,de5sx3d,2,t5_2r413

If youre looking for a off the beaten track kind of trip I can also recommend taking Route  across Nevada towards Lake Tahoe.,roadtrip,df0j2au,3,t5_2r413
11200622,0,t3_5zv2pf,Im a night shift nurse so Im used to marathoning all night. Ive also done long drives and road trips. I am also a yoga instructor. In my experience when someone is getting tired at work or in the car stopping to do some sort of physical activity is hugely helpful. I pull over and do my yoga sequence for ten minutes. At work do the sameor go for a long power walk off the unit. Changing positions and environments is great for the body. ,roadtrip,df1krmo,3,t5_2r413

11222915,0,t1_df3spzy,I used to live in Rapid City South Dakota so Mount Rushmore was a staple of my life growing up.  Theres tons to do and see in South Dakota its really what you feel like seeing.  Theres also Crazy Horse Monument in my mind thats more controversial though both monuments are offensive to local tribes because white society came in blew up sacred mountains and then carved them into faces as an attraction.  Theres also a lot of parks around and Rapid City has a really nice natural history museum with lots of dinosaur bones.  Lots of complete skeletons are excavated in the Dakotas and parts of Wyoming and Montana. Im not sure if they still have it but they used to have an open excavation pit with elevated walkways so that you could see what went into paleontology.If you want to see some kitschy classic Americana stop in the town of Wall on your way East the Wall Drug is a famous stop they used to have the best tritip and ribs youd ever have and they had plaster jackelopes and buffalo and covered wagons that tourists would pose for pictures with.  It reminds me of old Route .,roadtrip,df43qm0,1,t5_2r413

11355399,0,t3_620c6h,I think if you have two drivers take reasonable breaks and alternate accordingly  days could easily be done.  days is pushing it at  hours of driving each day as its roughly a  hour drive without making any stops. You could drive  days spend  days in Utah and then drive back in  days. That I think would be fine. Once youre in Utah all the parks you want to go to will be only  hours at most apart.,roadtrip,dfj43kd,1,t5_2r413

11569708,0,t1_dg669dc,Excellent coverage of BadlandsBlack HillsGreater Yellowstone! I agree that Custer SP is not to be missed especially the Iron Mountain Road and Needles Hwy.  with this route I highly suggest buying the America the Beautiful Pass for  that gives you basic blanket admission to every NPS USFS and BLM facility. It will not cover parking or camping fees but it will cover your entrance fees and basic admission to visitor centers all across the country for a whole year and easily save you a boatload of cash. We went to  national parks Devils Tower and the National Oregon Trail Interpretative Center over two trips in two years and paid just  for that pass for our car instead of over  in fees.Also I grew with taking the southern route US to Yellowstones East Entrance. Ten Sleep Canyon is incredible on the west side of the Bighorns!  See the Cody Nite Rodeo in Cody when you pass through...its held every night at  I think and is fun to see. And dont miss Grand Teton...its nothing like Yellowstone and has incredible mountains and incredible hiking!,roadtrip,dg7fkaa,1,t5_2r413
11586231,0,t1_dg9an2v,yes we had some problems. Weve said we wanted to drive the car from LA to Miami. When we fullfilled the rental and we payed everything our rental agreement said we had to deliver the car in LA again. It was a pain to get it changed to Miami.. Other then that dont forget to get an international drivers licence from your towncity hall  ,roadtrip,dg9b1oi,1,t5_2r413
11623652,0,t1_dgd3l6s,Thanks for your answer.I already knew about the left lane but didnt know you could get a ticket just for that. A question is did you apply the sticker in the front glass or you just had it available? Also what was the rental company? I am asking because rarely rental cars have tax paid for another country other their registration.,roadtrip,dgdjwa4,1,t5_2r413

11686557,0,t1_dgk5mpg,I drive across country from LA to NY every summer so throughout the year I collect places that sound interesting and throw them on the map.  Its Texas BBQ heavy because for the past few years I take the  to NOLA stay there for a couple of days and then head up north from there. Its a pretty random idiosyncratic collection of places to break up the drive.  ,roadtrip,dgkot12,1,t5_2r413
