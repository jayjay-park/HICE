3097758,0,t3_2vbkd0,Itd be a pretty cool gimmick. I could see it happening if  when holographic devices becomes as common as smartphones. There would be a number of technical challenges involved but by the time holographic displays are common enough for this to be economically feasible it will probably be possible.Speaking of gimmicks it would be interesting to have a play where each member of the audience could choose different costumes props and effects to see. You could metaphorically or literally doodle a mustache on Hamlet as he gives a speech dressed in a Starfleet uniform in front of an active volcano... if thats the sort of thing youre into.Itd also be cool for improv games for the audience to be able to vote on virtual props and environments. The ability to show or hide the scene from particular performers could let you do fun things like Whose Lines Newsflash game,HoloLens,coj2y3u,1,t5_360kl
3194346,0,t1_cosf7g4,I suspect youll be able to anchor shortcuts to apps and documents in D space to prevent FOV clutter but then we run into issues with tracking drift. This might be resolvable by use of the depth tracker to identify the headsets position in space relative to the background but what if you move objects around?Also most apps are going to have to follow you around for obvious reasons. Theyre all contained in the headset after all why would I want to move my physical body to access them? Theres also the question of how Im going to tell the device Ive moved from one context to another is it going to recognize the room Im in? Is it going to deadreckon its way from home to work and back? ,HoloLens,cot3e3y,2,t5_360kl

3498831,0,t3_30axyx,This is really neat tech but its not what the HoloLens is using.They need both a pinlight plane with a light source beside it and a modulation plane in front of that. The two planes need to be separated as the size of the image projected by one pinlight is related to the separation between the planes though many pinlights are used to increase this imageFOV size. The HoloLens design doesnt show this structure at all. Its also pretty recent work and they outline a bunch of problems with their optics so Microsoft would have to be well ahead of the state of the art in research for them to be using this in HoloLens. Future generations perhaps.Their comment on focus is also interestinggt In a tiled pinlight projector display changes from the expected eye focus do not cause the image to become appreciably blurred but rather change the scaling of the tiled subimages among the various projectors so that they expand or contract causing tile gaps or overlaps to occur in some cases. This is expected to appear less natural to the user than normal focal blur. However the change in scaling is small unless the viewer is focused at very close range e.g. the change in scaling from a distance of  m to infinity is lt  in a typical display see Equation . Gaps caused by nearer than expected focus can be avoided by configuring the pinlight projectors so that they slightly overlap.,HoloLens,cpr3bxb,1,t5_360kl

I did not ask him for details but I would assume that they may have a gb gb gb and gb models possibly.  Or even a WIFI only version and a GCellular version.  The reason for this approach may be to allow a lower barrier to entry for consumers who want a hololens but can not afford to pay for a loaded device.  I am wondering if they may take a similar path as they do with their Windows Surface Tablets though? ,HoloLens,cqh3962,1,t5_360kl

5464406,0,t3_3pvkvw,Wow I would have backed off after the first time or two. Were you able to get any questions in or was it all eaten up by the guy? In case anyone else is interested Here are some of the QnA questions and responses I had during my demo. What is the resolution of the HoloGrams?A Employees said that they were not allowed to discuss specs or specifics. How about a qualitative assessment of the resolution. Can I use it to read a holographic book where the text is clear enough to read? Or have a virtual laptop infront of me?A Employees said that it was difficult to answer this question but they did point to the fine particles of smoke during the XRay game as a testament to the resolution.. I noticed that there were strategically placed objects and pictures on the wall where the Holograms happened to be appearing. Did HoloLens use these as visual anchors to enhance the experience? E.g. would perhaps HoloLens not work as well in an environment with very plain walls or floors?A Employees did not directly answer my questions but did state the multiple sensors are used to recreate surroundings and that HoloLens should work well in various environments.. Will the Dev version of HoloLens be exactly or very similar to the version we tried today? For example the FOV or any other aspect. A Employees said they are not able to discuss differences if any in the Dev version vs todays version.. Since you mentioned that apps developed for Hololens will be universal apps and windows  apps will apps that I develop be available to the public and can I monitize them?A. Employees said that in the nearterm apps are intended just for developers and will not be made available to a broad audience and not monetized yet. Also employees could not confirm if apps developed for this version of Hololens would work for future versions of hololens if any.,HoloLens,cwa4o7a,8,t5_360kl
6161597,0,t1_cyps729, I agree with you that  seems like a reasonable price point...However MS initially wanted  for the XBone. The Surface lines have all remained at premium price points. Even though they could knock out a  product and become the new laptop standard. I could easily see Microsoft pricing st gen Hololens at . At the top end and  for an entry level device. I think in reality there are big issues with the field of vision. There are a load of professional uses where it would seem preferable not to have complete immersion. Home users on the other hand... ,HoloLens,cyq0dj5,2,t5_360kl

7300533,0,t1_d27zvfb,Thats difficult to answer based on only using the built in apps thus far. Definately it can do as small as around x inches as Ive placed things on a flat area of wall this small. For the Conkers game i can visually see it mapping a pillow with visible triangles which seem to be around x inches Id guess. I dont know if what I see matches with its actual granularity. Visibly if you imagine a mesh of triangular netting or chicken wire slowly draping over a surface thats what the mapping looks like. So my best guess is x granularity but a x cube may show up more like a pyramid than a cube if sticking up from a flat surface.,HoloLens,d280rg3,1,t5_360kl
