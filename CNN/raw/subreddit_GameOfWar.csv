5311866,0,t3_3nrd9u,I reviewed the terms and while Im no lawyer I have a huge issue with section  which waives legal rights. It specifically mentions waiving right to class action but I am wondering how their legalese might apply to arbitration in other circumstances. I have zero law expertise but if I know MZ they will phrase it just right to legally bind you in such a way that they can basically do whatever the hell they want with no legal repercussions. They do include this paragraphWe agree to provide you with  days notice through the Game if we change this Section . Notwithstanding any provision in this License to the contrary we agree that if we make any future change to this Section  you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within  days of the change to legalmachinezone.com.Would it be reasonable to accept the terms but send an email immediately rejecting section ? Is there a legal imperative to allow people to opt out of this specific waiver?My other concern is that section  relates to class action lawsuits and these are primarily a U.S. Phenomenon. How will this affect my rights in the EU? The EU are typically harder on corporations and protect consumers when it comes to ambiguity in the law compared to the US. They proudly advertise the game as the first truly international game of its kind. I am guessing their legal team is primarily focused on US law.There is another waiver in the interactions with others sectionIf you live in California you waive California Civil Code  which says A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.If you live outside of California you waive any other statute law or rule of similar effect in your jurisdiction.The last sentence has very broad implications and worries me as to how it could be applied. Edit I just read the bit that says if you live in the EU then none of section  applies to you. Does this mean that by agreeing I explicitly do not waive this right or that no such right exists to begin with?While on the topic of the EU the European courts today ruled that personal data pertaining to service users in Europe must be kept private within European borders and can not be communicated to rd parties including US bodies NSA etc. I dont know the full extent of it but it directly related to Facebook and personal data that must be kept in Europe. How does this clash with Section  of the Terms of Use? They basically say they are going to take my data and use it as they wish. Now they will argue they have not had enough time to respond to the ruling but I dont want to accept the terms until they are compliant with such a ruling and in the meantime my account is ready to be pillaged. Any advice? Thanks,GameOfWar,cvqnike,1,t5_2yvi6
