Im not saying I agree with the sign or the KKK but you have to admit the sign is right it aint racist.Furthermore you wanting to deface it because its prowhite is racist.

It would be like me saying Well let me see what you have done for the environment to try to devalue your statement.I get the fact that spraypaint is bad for the environment and yes in a sense Ill agree that graffiti is wasteful but the fact that he painted the whole train cart black then added some purple drips is boring and in my opinion vandalising. He even felt he had to write purple rain in the middle in case people wouldnt get it. That just goes to show that his work is uninspirational and bland.,Graffiti,d2ec9um,-4,t5_2qhxu

All the politicians are beholden to demands of the business elite regardless of party affiliation. Most of the politicians are from that very elite themselves. There is no real choice the whole electoral game is a spectacle designed to confuse people about where real power lies. The ignorant mindset is the one that believes that their vote actually determines anything. It is also amusing that you blame those that denounce the electoral system as a fraud as being to blame for only having idiots to vote for.,Graffiti,d9rbo2x,1,t5_2qhxu
