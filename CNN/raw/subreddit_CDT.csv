9046252,0,t1_d7z0c53,jawnzee your perception of what getting lost means will very likely change . . . LOL yes exactly! There were a lot of times on the CDT where I couldnt find a specific trail junction or the trail seemed to be missing and I would just shrug and instead bushwhack or take some alternate route. I love that the CDT isnt a single track but rather a matrix of possibilities.,CDT,d7z7qvi,3,t5_2wfk4

If you hike Roan High Knob area those are some awesome hikes with good hills to get motivated for your upcoming CDT. I think I might still head to New Mexico in late April and attempt a NOBO. ,CDT,ddmqspn,1,t5_2wfk4
