5117835,0,t3_3l2mmr,Amazon.Ca has a good selection of stuff and it can be well priced and free shipping on most things .   I havent found anywhere else online that is worth it after shipping duties and the value of our dollar. If you can wait use camel camel camel to wait for a price drop.   Got a couple ratltrap for  each  weeks ago. Bass pro is all in usd and shipping and duties and dollar kill any deal you could possibly get. ,FishingOntario,cv2w2od,1,t5_38wo7
6972492,0,t3_4b42kr,Ill go to these places if I cant find time to head to cottage country on a weekendHeart lake  BramptonKen whillans  CaledonIsland lake  OrangevilleKelso lake  MiltonOakville?Ponds in palgrave just off hwy Bellwood lake west of Erin. Generally the further you drive the bigger the fish.  If you want good bass fishing anywhere in the kawarthas can be good.  A boat can get you into better areas of certain lake and most lakes have some sort of boat rentals.  Even a  aluminum boat is good enough for most lakes.  ,FishingOntario,d16o3ot,2,t5_38wo7
