7377276,0,t1_d2g8bnq,If youre feeling confident going into a MU against like someone like Corki the mana sustain from Dorans  ignite can definitely net a kill. In other bad MUs against Ahri or Brand youll likely get forced out of lane so grabbing sapphire crystal  tp is the way to go.,RyzeMains,d2gqtru,2,t5_39cxp

7883008,0,t1_d4232ln,Yy hopefully they threw their idea out about reducing the skill gap otherwise well get an easy champion with  skill level dealing too low or too high damage,RyzeMains,d424fz0,2,t5_39cxp
8687173,0,t1_d6r5pda,I definitely wouldnt say Ryze needs  CDR. Ive had great success on a  CDR build because his Q isnt affected by it and his E is already so low.,RyzeMains,d6riv7o,1,t5_39cxp
9239048,0,t1_d8l5idd,riot also doesnt nerf things if only dedicated mains do well on it. i mean sion support has been pretty good for a while now bt noone plays it well. same for stuff like galio. riot generally nerfs things if theyre. unreasonably strong in certain elos i.e. if ryze would be pb in worlds liek syndra appears to be atm or if annie would have like a  winrate in bronze or so. high skillcap champions also doing really well even when not mastered i.e. yasuo a patch or so back when veen new people had like a  winrate over a fairly big playrate. FOTM while still doing wellryze doesnt really fall in nay of the categories. i could see them shifting around some power or tweaking him a biti.e. reduce his early damage a bit and give him somewhat larger range on W and E but i dont see them nerfing him to be honest. heck only masters and challenger is getting above  winrates on him and even then those are middle of the pack winrates all other elos hes at the bottom.,RyzeMains,d8n47q9,1,t5_39cxp

9383054,0,t1_d95d2ue,One of the most annoying things about Realm Warp is that its so telegraphed that most people with an escape can simply walk away from where youre coming from. Reducing the time on the channel might be a good idea as well. Im starting to not even level Realm Warp and just focus on strong laning by leveling his basic abilities first.,RyzeMains,d95d9lz,1,t5_39cxp
9423062,0,t1_d9a4hzr,Its not wrong. Ill tell you that much the additional mana you get from seraphs passive increasing your ap does indeed go back into increasing your mana furthur and thus increasing AP recursively. Im very confident that my maths isnt flawed and will predict behaviour accurately. Use whatever math you want and reply in a comment predicting how much ManaAp a level  Ryze  Mana with no runesmasteries or dragons will have with these items  Only Seraphs Seraphs and Morellos Seraphs and Deathcap Seraphs Morellos and Deathcap Seraphs  Morellos and a Deathcap Seraphs  Morellos and a DeathcapIm thinking you might be right on the AP and Mana for the first few since league rounds values before displaying them in your hotbar but keeps them as floats internally. But by failing to account for recursive behaviour you will probably be wrong for the last few when Ryze has a lot of AP and Mana built. Ill make a video or something with those items in a custom to show whos predictions will be right.Now if you are old enough for something like this Id love to give you an explaination of why the Qs are the same using Curse voice or Hangouts to have a voice call and using drawpile or similar to illustrate what is happening. If your not old enough for it I guess Ill record a video of me doing some maths with diagrams and things. ,RyzeMains,d9afs5z,1,t5_39cxp

9891936,0,t1_dawxfbv,I think thats what they will do. Ryze has a lot of early game damage for a scaling mage so lowering base damage and buffing the ratio is a pretty good change but they might even lower it to hurt him even more. We will have to see when the poat gets updated I guess.,RyzeMains,dawxxw7,3,t5_39cxp

10266871,0,t3_5mvrtb,. Tomo oce nz.. I love ryze because his damage is often under rated and he is the best champion to fountain dive with. Nope been trying to apply for maokai mains but havnt heard anything back.. As much spare time as i have which is outside of classes and league would prob be doing the most while waiting for the long oce queue timesAnd about css i took a small class on it last year and am doing a larger one this year.If i got the role the first thing i would do is work on the side bar its looking pretty empty right now,RyzeMains,dc7t0tx,1,t5_39cxp

10848246,0,t3_5v1eh0,I first picked up Ryze during his previous iteration.  Didnt play him particularly often but I somewhat regularly took him toplane for the level  allin which half the time bursted the enemy laner to nothing. After the rework came around I thought to myself Id consider myself a Ryze player I should learn this new version.  I found it to actually be quite fun.  His gameplay now had a lot more depth to it than Wait for opponent to be slightly out of position then WQERQEQWQEQWQEQWQ to infinity.I feel the recent nerfs have done pretty much nothing tbh.  Ryze is still one of the strongest mages in the game if played well and I still get enemies turning into rivers of pure salt after I oneshot them.To sum it up Id say the prerework Ryze was more broken and I enjoyed it because it was so braindead but the new one is better and probably way healthier for the game which I like.,RyzeMains,ddyx51i,4,t5_39cxp
