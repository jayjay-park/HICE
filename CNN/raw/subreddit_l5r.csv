1603839,0,t3_2clfu0,i have nothing against this artist at all and i think he does good work. but this is not what kickstarter is for. kickstarter is for generating funding to START a project. Sams project is already finished. Hes already painted all of the pieces AND been paid by AEG for them. He doesnt need any capital to start printing mats. he can have them printed as needs them. even after his customer has paid him if he really cant front the money. i think the perks are a good deal but what he needs to do is just set up an online store and offer the same things. the way kickstarter works is all or nothing. so if he doesnt make his goal of k no one gets anything. ,l5r,cjhbzan,4,t5_2skzf
3637221,0,t1_cq6m6sc,Thanks for the tip. I did what you said and gave a quick rundown of the clans and told him about the different ways of winning a game.  But he did pick spider on his own. ,l5r,cq6vcj1,1,t5_2skzf

4428763,0,t1_csorrzj,Agreed on Doji Dainagon and Rhetoric that style is unique but I think its also very fitting. A shame it isnt used just a bit more frequently.,l5r,csoxp6j,2,t5_2skzf

5046356,0,t1_cuu5jls,Relax. A high power level doesnt mean faster games in average. Dont believe me? The oldest running tcgccg in existence magic the gathering has several formats. Vintage the most powerful one actually has a critical turn higher than two other formats in the game.Vampire the eternal struggle did not get an increase in speed with a higher power level. In fact the higher power actually allowed slower decks to get a higher presence in the metagame.I could give more examples but these should suffice. Dont confuse the two concepts. Power level is NOT speed.,l5r,cuu9zni,6,t5_2skzf
5730627,0,t3_3tl4y0,Its gonna be kind of hard. If hes a card player he probably has most of the cards that are current. And if he doesnt it probably wont matter because the game has been cancelled. If you could find something like an uncut sheet of cards or some old iconic cards hed probably be into that. Youll have a lot more luck asking on the Facebook group.,l5r,cx7fuxm,1,t5_2skzf

8011682,0,t3_4oy254,Narratively it was common for the more powerful members of one family to send their kids to another familys school.  Incharacter depending on the school it may come with an obligation strategic batrothal or may have required some favor currying.  In my group we never forced anybody to explain why a Doji was training in the Kakita Bushi school for example. Mechanically I know of no restriction on crosstraining within the clans schools.,l5r,d4gl5xt,3,t5_2skzf
10005014,0,t3_5ivg5b,Im excited enough to actually consider taking time off work to go to GenCon for the first time just to see it ever so slightly quicker.,l5r,dbbokhq,2,t5_2skzf
10176075,0,t1_dbxhkfi,A Matsu Berserker is a samurai and it would be freakish for one not to wear his swords. Every character that you can make with the standard rules is a samurai of one kind or another with the semiexception of Togashi and Henshin monks which are complicated. If you go into the optional rules in Book of Water you can create monks which are not samurai and thus could not legally wear the daisho.Basically a characters school has no impact on how they can legally arm themselves unless they are a monk. It has some implications on how they would normally be armed but not hard restrictions. ,l5r,dbxiivb,3,t5_2skzf
10399242,0,t1_dcmr2o6,Good question. In my mind if Fu Leng was going to aim to accomplish anything it would be to kill his brothers and sisters and even more than anything Onnotagu. Fu Lengs power would be greatly increased. A few things that are facts in my mind please feel free to disagree and let me know what you think.. Fu Lengs Empire would continue to grow. More tainted Humans More Goblins and more Undead.. With the proper embrace of the Emperor Fu Leng Jigoku would also increase the Yokai would grow the Kansen would grow and the Akutenshi would also grow. Eventually Jigoku would be a much bigger force than Yomi.. If Fu Leng remains the lord of Jigoku he could easily use his force to crush the forces of Yomi. Now that Im thinking about it I dont know for certain where the other Gods live but assuming they live in Yomi it would be a challenge for them to deal with so many tiny challenges. Think of it like a very large hornets nest the death of a thousand cuts.Now in my mind the Kami would not be willing to die here and would retreat to fight another day. Essentially they would be absent. I could see a few being dead but I dont want the fight to be completely hopeless just a real uphill climb.The campaign setting is in the formulation stage here so Im really open to any ideas or thoughts you might have.,l5r,dcmtjxc,1,t5_2skzf

11714067,0,t1_dgnk10x,gtAnd while it looks like Crab will be a defensive deck in this version you know as an OldR player yourself that that was not a central theme to them for the majority of the games life.Kaiu wall SH says what?!? They also had a decent milcontrol deck out of RED.,l5r,dgnthgm,1,t5_2skzf
11787124,0,t3_6800y9,Hey thanks man. You guys have been so receptive and positive about all this its going to make it much easier to get motivated to do nice things in the future. I really appreciate all the kind words. ,l5r,dgw3ynv,3,t5_2skzf
