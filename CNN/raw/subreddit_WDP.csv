2596407,0,t1_cmxhgj4,As I mentioned theyve been saying that for decades and it hasnt happened in the predicted manner. To the skeptics at this point it wont count as actually happening until its obviously happening.Put it this way Theres been a dude in the back seat of the Jeep screaming about how the road is turning. Hes been there for almost an hour. When he started he was screaming about how the road was turning to the left and we had to turn left really sharply or wed run off the road and die ten minutes later. Twenty minutes later he started screaming about how he was wrong the roads turning to the right and we have to turn right really sharply or well run off the road and die ten minutes later. At various points hes also been screaming about swarms of bees locusts mountains and everyone starving to death and also please give him money so he can scream more loudly seriously its vitally important that he gets a lot of money from you or youre all going to die.The road has turned slightly at times. But its always turned back. There have been no plagues no swarms and while its been cloudy once or twice fundamentally nothing bad has happened.Right now hes screaming that the road is turning right and we have to turn right really sharply or well run off the road and die ten minutes later. And the road is in fact turning right . . . but its not turning right any more than it was the previous times and its always turned back before and the guys been screaming for an hour now and hes never once been right and in the meantime hes demanding money so he can scream at you more.Would you trust him?,WDP,cmxhjw3,2,t5_2rke8

7693954,0,t3_49k4xn,Its a sliding scale of our societal norms where the opposite is fantasized about.We as a society have everything. We dont want for things. We have people gadgets resources aplenty and really nothing to get in the way of that. What zombie movies do is strip that all that away. Since were so well off this appeals to us. Stories like The Martian also tap this vein.In the olden days the popular stories were ones of great wealth where people didnt have hard lives.,WDP,d3gr49n,2,t5_2rke8
