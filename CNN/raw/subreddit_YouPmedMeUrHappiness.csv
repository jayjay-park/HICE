10906766,0,t1_de4vbwl,If requested Ill remove the username as I said. The nature of sending me happiness seems to me that theres an amount of feeling pride in whatever is being sent. Almost all of the happiness Ive received are getting out of debt or otherwise a sticky situation a joke or my SO.Beyond that Ive gotten three messages about the subreddit thus far one was you got the username wrong one was  and one was you. If public opinion suggests that people would rather I not include the name then Ill change it but for now if someone says that theyre now  years clean from drug usage or something then Id like people to be able to congratulate them. A notification is sent whenever I quote someone because of the username comment bot so if they dont want their username there then Ill get rid of it but for now Ill keep it as it is.,YouPmedMeUrHappiness,de4yetn,2,t5_3j87l
