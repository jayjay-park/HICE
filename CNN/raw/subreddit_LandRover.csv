Im saying this as someone can do all the work myself  the problem is that replacement parts are expensive and time consuming to install in a lot of cases example its great fun and nearly an all day job dropping the headliner to replace a  sunroof gear another example would be a bad nav unit which is rape at the dealer.,LandRover,co653jj,1,t5_2s3j9

8854577,0,t3_51hj02,generally they are very simple and once you spend the time to get it is good running order especially the diesel its pretty easy going old fart of a rig. They can be expensive to you will learn to figure it out on your own. If in the U.S depending on where you are parts can be a nightmare. As far as the diesel goes. if its cold your screwed must keep her warm. As for hauling. if you put a chevy  in it sure but as is its good at low speeds because of its gear ration but .its not fast to begin with. . it is almost useless on the highway as it doesnt go much over  or  and hills? haha right lane hazards on buddy sslllooowwww. overall a fantastic beautiful vehicle but built safari not speed. ,LandRover,d7c70x6,1,t5_2s3j9

9192852,0,t1_d8cgjzj,I did post this recently and not sure my question was answered...Ive had several car questions as of late.  Ole Rover has been trouble... lots of things these past  months and have been tackling each as they come.  With the wisdom of my pops and forums such as these Ive been able to tackle most of these issues as they come.  Each issue has been a learning experience.  Regardless I have an appointment with a different person who confirm he can run a diagnostic for me on the solenoids.  So hoping hes more competant because the last said it wasnt possible.  ,LandRover,d8h9foz,1,t5_2s3j9
9262162,0,t3_577opg,The plugs for pretty much every feature are installed from factory they just left the plugs and switches and such off. I grabbed a set of rear aux controls and seat heater switches for mine from one out of a junk yard,LandRover,d8q1nfc,2,t5_2s3j9

9609579,0,t3_5cme4m,Just wanted to share my appreciation for this beauty and for Rovers in general! I put the work into it since Ive gotten her and shes treated me well thus far and I couldnt be happier! There was a time were I was worried about my comfort level on the repairs needed and kicked around selling her to a proper owner but Im so glad I decided to keep her and work on her. Heres to income tax season putting new tires on her and making her better still  And when the day comes I will most certainly be getting a LR ,LandRover,d9xks0u,2,t5_2s3j9

9818038,0,t3_5fv5f3,I would buy that truck in a heartbeat. But Im already too deep into the Land Rover obsession. ,LandRover,danb4hj,5,t5_2s3j9
9883917,0,t1_d9r79ox,Completely different truck than an LRD. I got K on my p as well then gave it to a college kid. It was still driving  years after I gave it away. I never did any major work on it. Had a D that was the biggest POS I ever owned.  engines in K miles fortunately all covered by extended warranty. Needs head gaskets every K miles. LR is a really nice truck. Has some issue with bushings rear diff maybe tcase and few other things. Not even close to the p in terms of reliability. Wish I still had my classic. Miss that truck and best front seats Ive ever had in any car or truck. ,LandRover,davwcdw,2,t5_2s3j9

10787828,0,t1_ddskf2d,The old split tailgate did exactly that and didnt manage to look like a cheap carpet covered piece of wood. The bottom gate kept things from falling out of the back and it made an awesome seat.  The top gate was an overhead rain cover.,LandRover,ddsoqns,2,t5_2s3j9

10980977,0,t1_decau1n,Tensioners and timing chain guides are plastic and when the tensioner goes bad the timing chain starts slopping around against the guides and screws up the chain. If they replaced it with a non plastic tensioner then youll be fine although its stupid if they didnt replace the plastic guides while they were already right there,LandRover,decnqnt,3,t5_2s3j9

11393431,0,t3_62hxjk,To fix and keep or cut your losses is a personal one. I ask my customers if they love it then spend the money and keep it. Otherwise dont spend anything on it and cut your losses. For the problem.  A blown head gasket will very rarely cause a miss fire. Only seen that on very bad cases.Easy to check head gaskets do a tee kay test. When the rover V do heads they will put compression into the cooling system and over pressurise the cooling system and start spewing coolant out.If it does fail the test you will have to watch out for dropped linners. This is common on the later V due to manufacturing tolerances.As for the misfire HT leads are the most likely suspect especially since your mechanic didnt replace them. You can see if they are tracking or at least hear it. You can also check the resistance on the leads.If you get it to a mechanic who has the right diagnostic computer it will tell you which cylinder is misfiring and how many times.  They will also be able to check why the warning light is on.I would suggest take it to a mechanic that specialises in them for problems like this truth be told I would say for anything.I should mention I own and run an independent Land Rover workshop and Ive seen owners spend a lot of money for their local guy to fix the wrong thing.,LandRover,dfnfgq6,2,t5_2s3j9

11587368,0,t1_dg9fadt,If you wanted. I suppose you could plug it in and re adjust the suspension at anytime. Really it just resets your baseline. So the height controls on the center console all work the same but the zero point is higher. The only real difference I noticed is that when I lift the truck now it doesnt wait until mph to lower it asks me to please lower the truck as soon as I have cleared the obstacle.,LandRover,dg9foov,2,t5_2s3j9
