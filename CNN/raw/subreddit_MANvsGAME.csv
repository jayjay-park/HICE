6017656,0,t3_3xwecg,Hes taking a sabbatical to get himself recharged and figured out. Some things happened on Twitter and a lot of personal stuff got said without him having any real say in it at all so he did come back and cast for a while but is taking a break now to fix his life. You can see what thats all about on another post in the subreddit regarding a dependancy he had on something that wasnt good for him. Im happy for him taking some time out to do what he needs so that he can come back stronger.EDIT Just wanted to add that on a response to someone who tweeted him he confirmed that hed at least be back for Dark Souls  so hes definitely not done with casting.,MANvsGAME,cy8fvfx,4,t5_2tw4w

8260085,0,t1_d56ii81,Its called drugs.  He is a drug addict and his rants arent even close to reasonable or even coherent anymore.  He honestly acts like any other delusional angry homeless methhead screaming on a street corner who is angry at the whole world for no reason now its impossible to watch that kind of negativity and illogical rage for even a few minutes anymore and I used to sub to Man look foward to his streams and watch him for hours.  He is a shell of the Man he used to be and its just too goddamn depressing to watch someones life spiral out of control.  Hes actually dating this crazyass cunt?  At least Tawny knew when to bail on him she seemed like the only thing keeping him sane and grounded when they were married and its been steadily downhill into madness ever since but jesus his stream is completely unwatchable now.,MANvsGAME,d5a2gyc,10,t5_2tw4w

8345220,0,t1_d5kpb3y,So youre going to just censor this subreddit now and posts that hundreds of people have upvoted because MAN threatened you?  utheGreatBlar before MAN forced him out of his mod position made it quite clear that he would never censor content on this sub.  Congrats on caving to MAN and destroying your own subreddit that was already dead before this incident went down.  Im done with this subreddit and done watching or thinking about MAN at all now just gonna let him fade away from mine and everyone elses memory.  Censorship is never the correct answer to a problem and you are just a MAN fanboi who just wants to suck his dick.  MAN and you should both be ashamed of yourselves for trying to censor the discussion of an entire community but no one can even discuss your behavior because you just censor it.  You and MAN are both pathetic.,MANvsGAME,d5kpfmu,3,t5_2tw4w
8391646,0,t1_d5qbuxu,I have never played a pokemon game and I have never played a Zelda game lol people think im crazy. When Zelda Ocarina of tiem came out on  my friend let me borrow it  but i cpuldnt get into it especially after playing Final fantasy . I was into cartoony graphics at the time. I was more of a Sega guy growing up. I did purchase an N but mostly just for goldeneye and starfox ohh and that wrestling game wcw vs nwo i think it was? That was the last Nintendo purchase i ever made. I gotta admit though from what i seen of that new Zelda game for the wii  wiiU or new Wii?,MANvsGAME,d5qi4gw,1,t5_2tw4w

9780613,0,t3_5a7quf,honestly best thing for me was juicing and drinking smoothies and at least learning about stuff like raw vegandont actually do it i jsut try to avoid things like gmos now lol. another thing that i caught onto was watching  a ted talk.guy was talking about how peoples brains shut down in the desert as part of fight or flight. pretty much got to do more deep breathing exercises when youre brain isnt focused and get out of that state. this was pretty hard to fix here but understanding that im able to get out of it more. ,MANvsGAME,daiobee,1,t5_2tw4w
