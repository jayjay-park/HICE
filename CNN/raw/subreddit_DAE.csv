Thats exactly what you stated.As for god being a superstition unless youre hiding unassailable concrete evidence of some gods existence  every god is a fiction a superstition. Thats not opinion thats fact.  Thats not to say a god or gods do not exist they may now or formerly have existed. Simple fact is there has never been an iota of even remotely concrete evidence proffered by any proponent of a gods existence.  Or a multihued three eyed two headed unicorn. Or a  foot tall turtle. Etc etc. They too may exist but theres zero proof now or then. So for all intents and purposes they along with your god do not exist.

3106220,0,t1_cojxy01,gt Regarding your assertion that Siris understanding is not the same as human understanding of course it is not the same. They may not even be comparable. They are different systems completely. If you accept this then I dont see how you can assert people are overestimating the competence of humans when assessing AI when you acknowledge they are different systems and may not be comparable.  I guess you believe that symbol manipulation without meaning is equivalent to symbol manipulation with meaning?gt The fact that they are not the same is a nonsequitur however in that not being the same does not imply one has greater or lesser understanding than the other.Well I believe its clear that humans do have a greater understanding than Siri of communication and the symbols being manipulated. I already provided sources of a huge body of work across multiple disciplines from philosophy to linguistics to neuroscience that illustrate exactly why  humans do indeed have much greater understanding than Siri does.I guess where we disagree is you dont think its possible to claim that humans have a greater understanding of manipulating language symbols for meaning than Siri?Or maybe you are claiming that meaning doesnt  matter in this case all that matters is symbol  manipulation?,DAE,cojyirf,1,t5_2r6cf

9714390,0,t1_daahwzo,I have rheumatoid arthritis was undiagnosed since age  when all the autoimmune symptoms were apparent. My parents dont believe in doctors so I had to do things on my own accord when I got older .maybe you should check your autoantibodies or xray if you can the blood test I think shows more. But ya RA has affected my heart and lungs as well its really inaccurate to call it arthritis. My joints have mild erosion and my muscles have inflammation. Im not sure if it makes me depressed bc I have lots of trauma and stuff that affected me more. Im largely healed from it though. I feel ya. My deductible has been so high post Obama being in office that everything is out of pocket. Can you get Medicaid when youre ? And yes I hate being medicated.  Take lamictal remeron as needed and plaquenil for RA. I wouldnt take pain pills or anti inflammatory pills. I only take plaquenil bc it stops my immune system from attacking my body so it stops the degeneration of the disease. But ya try to get Medicaid once you can then do the blood test or xrays if you can. ,DAE,daaic1r,1,t5_2r6cf

I get paranoid that theyll be talking about me behind my back if Im not there which makes it seem easier to just go. Whenever I do go to something Id rather avoid I actually really enjoy it. The feeling of anxiety is almost always way worse than being there. Its just so crippling that the thought of seeing people is terrifying. Thats a great tip.
