Ive never had a shank pop like that but like suggested before take them to someone who can resole boots. Boots like these and personally owning boots in the exotic range i would seek someone who makes boots and specifically deals with boots. Me being in texas thats easy to find and i have a custom boot maker about  minutes from my house. Contacting lucchese would be a good idea because they can refer you to someone or if a recall correctly they have a department for you to send them in they will do it im sure you would have to pay but would ensure they were fixed properly. ,cowboyboots,d3b3qly,1,t5_2s7ji
