Always got compared to my brothers growing up and well sexist shit.Now just trying to ignore their opinions. They dont know who I am or what Ive been throughas much as they think they do! Im just going to continue doing my thing trying to improve and learn. Its cool that you have cousins that you can relate with and have nice convos!   Being a good role model doesnt mean one has to have a bunch of accolades or be the perfect human being I think it means being someone with flaws and all who treats peopleand themselves well and just being themselves ya know? ,YoureDoingItRight,dgks3ed,3,t5_3htif
