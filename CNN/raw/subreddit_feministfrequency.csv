4014076,0,t1_crdrd7m,The dogs were an analogy. I understand the token rule of film amp television entertainment. But I recognize that there are fields of work that women excel and other fields where theres historically been little interest. Women seeking director roles is rising incredibly. I expect it to balance out in relatively short time over the next decade. There used to be the same lackofwomen in other male dominated industries Construction mechanics amp legislature. Our colleges encouraged young women to seek broader opportunities and theyve took full advantage of it. Today women are easily finding work in these fields and receiving higher wages than their male counterparts. The Film amp Gaming Industries are the newest opportunity ... Female directors are popping up everywhere and proving their value. Women in the Actors Guild has also grown exponentially. Theyre everywhere maybe not in some blockbuster films but Ive got a great collection movies by Women Directors ... The Hurt Locker comes to mind. Wonderful film!  Women in Gaming Services are still a minority  but theyre offered higher salaries than men to encourage more women to fill these jobs. Its only a matter of time before those higher wages attract the female college students to their doors.The message Im hearing from Anita Sarkeesian doesnt match these facts. Shes too pessimistic about gender issues and shes not offering real solutions to the given issue. Id rather hear from college professors more versed on the topic than see people receive poor information from a YouTube celebrity.,feministfrequency,crdu36w,0,t5_2wktc
