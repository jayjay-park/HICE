5036546,0,t1_cut1agz,In this instance there is not a big difference. The idea for remote desktop originated at ETH where of course you cant push via mobile so it is really more relevant there. But here it provides a little extra layer of security say you mistime the push and load the page a little too late after the timer has been reset. Or worst case scenario your mobile connection is down but comes back up with some time left and of course the timer is already reset on a fresh page visit but you can still remote back to your other computer where it is still ticking. Of course a potential downside of remote desktop is that it might allow cheating as you can pretty much have all the numbers input in the remote desktop field and just press enter on it. ,theswanstation,cut3fw3,2,t5_39m22
