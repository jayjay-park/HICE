164586,0,t3_1vz0ci,Cant answer everything but heres my  cents.  year game audio vetI got my break because of who I knew. Someone I went to school was able to get my resume into the right hands. That said I also already had several years under my belt as a recording engineer.I would say if I was looking for someone Id want them to have been focused on games. All experience is good but I want to see they have a passion for this area of audio.Sorry no idea where to look for internships. I do know most jobs are word of mouth in the audio field. Sorry no help there either.As said before prepare to be freelance. There are way more people looking for audio freelancers then there is inhouse full time spots.,GameAudio,cex6g3f,2,t5_2scqj

962804,0,t3_254il8,I got my first gig while still in school by sticking my neck out in class. My teacher was showing off a project she was doing sound on in class and I blurted out do you need music? Turned out they did and a classmate and I did the soundtrack.  While we got studented according to the devs  who I am still friends with and working with and only got paid like  on a game that sold hundreds of thousands they guiltbuy me a lot of beer and it put my name on a very high quality game.  My second gig was a composition job I acquired through schoolmate. I had done music for his final project and he recommended me. I did an audition piece and got picked then my friend got hired at EA so I took over SFX and we brought on another composer for support on music. That wound up being a game called Rogue Legacy and it did very well. Of course those are the ones that made it off the tarmac. There were plenty that went nowhere or didnt start at all which all contained their own little lessons. Im pretty happy with how things are going so am not sure what I would change if I could have a Mulligan. Work super hard work on everything you can. Get contracts! Figure out reasonable rates and stick to them. Get used to rejection and learn to appreciate criticism and be wary of those who cant. Recognize when you are working on something with a lot of potential and really give it your all. I mean  do the best work you can all the time but when you really believe in a project it will be a lot easier. Passion melts hours. ,GameAudio,chdqacg,3,t5_2scqj

1310761,0,t1_cih1ze4,Thats what i might be doing once ive got three videos for a showreel. Have the full personal versions in the reel then have  separate videos that show the difference between the personal and original audio. Not sure how that would come across though.Ive just finished my degree in Music Technology where i picked most of the production and recording techniques up. But mostly everythings just come from looking stuff up online and books. All the Foley in the video i recorded myself along with the bullet impactswhizzesricochets. However things like the gunshots were taken from the BOOM Libraries GUNS construction pack which contains raw audio recordings rather than pre designed sound effects. It meant that i could actually design the gunshots myself rather than recycle someone elses hard work. Im going to be sending these showreels to employers once they are finished and i have my University results to try and find a job doing this sort of thing.

1420054,0,t3_2adq9x,Ive considered berklees school of music online courses  but to be very honest  most places Ive worked or interfaced with regarding a career in the Video Game industry for audio  your ability to showcase your work in a demo reel is weighted more than a certificate.  I know people who both have and do not have certificates in basic Sound Engineering to protools certifications.  Now that being said the actual course can be helpful if you need refreshing or might learn at least something new  but Id avoid paying a lot for something like that.  Coursera offers online courses for free I took a intro online course as a refresher when I was laid off since it had been some time since I was actually working on sound stuff since college. And many of them provide certificates.  So I would say  you need to decide what you want to do..  do you want to be a composer or do you want to be a sound designer?  Most places will want you to stick to one or the other...  if youre applying for both youre going to need two demo reels...  Showcase your work from your previous games  no matter how small.  Another way to break in is to do your time in QA  why you might ask?  You get a vantage point from the ground up on the development process.  avoid contractpublishing QA And you network if possible with the people in the company.  You learn the tools and get a backend view of how the guts are hooked up.  On that note if youre looking at wanting to show your capability in implementation  download fmod or wwise.  Work on some projects and show details of your hookups and understanding of how the middleware works  it will put you ahead of the competition   And you dont need to pay k for it.  ,GameAudio,ciua5np,5,t5_2scqj

2223924,0,t3_2kll53,Noise can be from all sorts of sources. Heres how to deal with them.. Preampgear self noise microphones and recorders have their own self noise. This is typically a white noisy hiss mostly in the high end. The h has a LOT of self noise. To reduce this upgrade gear with a lower noise signature. Sound Devices are well regarded for their low self noise and even the zoom h has much quieter preamps. Some gear has quiet preamps but a noisy headphone jack which can be misleading while recording. Check the specs of gear.. Wind noise Wind will produce a blown out sound for microphones. This also occurs when speaking plosives into mics without a pop filter. You can use windscreens like the Rode Deadcat Fits most XY devices and mics to reduce this a bit blimp systems to reduce it even more or even furry covered blimps to achieve maximum wind protection in extreme conditions. Every option reduces high end and becomes a trade off between high end and wind protection.. Noise on location when trying to capture a source you often have to eliminate other sounds in an area. To do this you must both have proper positioning as well as mic choice. Shotgun microphones eliminate sounds behind the microphone and help isolate sounds. Omni microphones capture everything and dont isolate at all. Some systems like parabolic mics and digital shotguns reduce and isolate the sound even more. Stereo XY microphones are generally condenser microphones with a bit of rear rejection but not nearly as much as a shotgun. Placement also helps reduce other noises on a location. If possible turn off anything making extra noise!. Handling noise most devices have TERRIBLE handling noise. They need to be used with a rycote suspension system or other system that isolates vibration from the user.Post Production ReductionYour last resort should be Izotope RX. Its ALWAYS best to deal with it on location first as much as possible  When recording on location its best to record room tone. This sonic signature gets loaded as noise and make reduction much easier and more accurate so RX knows exactly what the noise sounds like!Hope that helps.,GameAudio,clmiiq8,5,t5_2scqj

3057072,0,t3_2v6cxv,Step one Get a cat.Step two Post picture of cat. Really I just like seeing cats.Game audio is nonlinear stuff. Its more like post production than traditional music work. If youre solid on your audio tools and people skills it could be a fun field to get into.An example workflow you create your soundsmusic in your daw put them in a middleware engine Fmod Studio Wwise etc and then that is tied into a game engine. Which programers take care of that partComposers and sfx artists and middlewareaudio engine management are a basic categories. Some people do everything some may cover only the ambiences or footsteps in the entire game. Maybe you wont be making cool sounds right at the start or crazy cool scores.Its hard to generalize it though cause every game company tends to treat audio differently too. Audio is usually the smallest team. Video games just like the music industry have a creative grind that only people willing to stay can deal with. Youve done well though in the studio world so you are probably familiar with it!Id start by looking at middleware. Wwise is pretty popular. Really just depends on what you want to be.

The one I did in September was a little intimidating at first... there were some dudes with lots of gear and everything and I really went in blindly... but after the initial sitting and kind of brewing some ideas I found which areas I was best in fantasy SFX and music and I started from there.  After you get to talk to some of the audio guys you will see yourself branching out into other areas... I ended up helping with some dialogue some BIT sfx some futuristic stuff etc.Dont psyche yourself out over it because the atmosphere is very welcoming.Often they just want audio shipped to them and they implement everything.

9065321,0,t1_d7w0pla,Both options provide different results I think that both results are desirable in their own ways. Either way using a plugin or adding another layer are both technically layering. Most plugins used for creating low end are sub harmonic generators they are just synthesizers that reference frequencies from the original source and layer them at a lower frequency.

Best to avoid if possible IMO but working for free on student projects mods and other projects that arent making money is a very good way to build skills with others trying to break into games.Another truth is that finding a niche helps you stick out from the competition and one successful solid sounding title will get you attention.Finding a way to stand out of the sea of average and below average talent is one very good way to get more gigs within that niche ,GameAudio,d8i460l,1,t5_2scqj
