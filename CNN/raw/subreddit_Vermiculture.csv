1290610,0,t3_28udul,Six inches sounds pretty shallow to me... Im using five gallon buckets and have probably  of the bucket full of shredded paper. I havent had any problems with them trying to escape but the first day I did put a big table lamp pointing into the bin for  hours to force them down.  In my bucket though I see them deeper than six inches...in fact I dont really see many until I dig down about that far. You said the moisture is good....I have seen them group up near the top if I let it get a little too wet in there I screwed up bad when trying to start a new bin from the old bin  I soaked the newspaper stuck the new bucket on top of the old bucket hoping that they would migrate up but even though I let the paper drain out there was still too much water and I drowned a bunch. ,Vermiculture,ciet69i,2,t5_2s5ml
1949550,0,t1_ckn32c8,Yeah I get different types of molds in the bin depending mostly on what types of organic waste I throw in. If I ever put bread in usually will get real fluffy bread molds. Sometimes Ive gotten molds that when you press on them they shoot out clouds...those kind scare me a bit so I usually keep them buried.I almost always have a few tiny mushrooms growing  they are really thin and whispy not like any mushroom Ive ever seen. Still trying to identify them. A few times Ive come back from a week of vacation and have tons of plants growing out of the bin! I think its celery...they are whispy as well and really thin and really tall with only a few leaves. I think I have a picture somewhere I can post for you. Those are pretty strange and to me means that . it is incredible compost if plants can grow with almost no exposure to light and . probably overfed the bin those few times. I usually just have lots of worms tiny white mites molds fungi and some other little critters...never ants though. The main reason I freeze the scraps is because its so much easier to just stick them in a coffee tin in the freezer after you prepare a meal rather then mess around with the worm bin. Also it helps me keep track of how often and how much I feed the worms. Finally the fact that you freeze and thaw the scraps allows the cells to break down much quicker which makes it a lot easier for the microbes to take hold. Strange about your ants. The bottom bucket on mine always has a little lechate in there  not much but enough to keep ants from being able to walk around. Maybe thats why I havent seen any ants before. If you dont have at least a little lechate in your bucket Id be worried that its too dry.Sounds like your system is doing great though! Awesome!,Vermiculture,cko4hgy,1,t5_2s5ml

Then feed every few days. We feed organic compost sourced from a local farmers market and a special grain mixture.  ,Vermiculture,cmvsco0,2,t5_2s5ml

4611802,0,t3_3e5eom,I dont see why it isnt possible. While it might be hard to I imagine you could selectively breed them. Their life cycle is pretty quick so you can easily go through many generations in a short amount of time.Now why it isnt done for a larger job it is easy enough to just get more worms. Hell theyll increase their population themselves if the food supply is sufficient. Alternatively another insect or worm can potentially fill in e.g. BSFL. If I were to selectively breed worms for anything I would make them more robust and versatile. Imagine red wigglers being totally fine in a BSFL infested bin? Control of BSFL would be easier for sure. How about having them handle citrus and other food products that they cannot currently handle? Less food waste going to the dump for me! Though Im unsure how bad it would be when they do escape into the wild...,Vermiculture,ctbwdti,1,t5_2s5ml
4964739,0,t1_cukc7vx,Awesome.  So what youre saying is just keep the wormsmud in there but put a lot more dry material in there and in a few weeks will be good to go?,Vermiculture,cukce7z,1,t5_2s5ml

6394648,0,t3_4379o0,The worms can not do much until the towels break down first so putting a bundle a side until the bacteria build up will help. Rot a bundle of stuff before you put it in the bin. That small of an operation will not actually be able to keep up but it will do better.  ,Vermiculture,czgi7f5,1,t5_2s5ml
