But as I see itA CAD operator is just the title of someone who is paid to use the software.  Official training would not be a strict requirement.A CAD Technologist would be a level above operator and would have some sort of diploma or at least have completed some training courses.A Certified Engineering Technologist has to complete a two year program at an accredited school plus have a certain level of experience and then write a test etc.  basically meet the requirements of the organization that is offering the certification.As Engineer will have a degree from a collegeuniversity in an engineering field.  There are certifications for engineers as well which will depend on wherewho the certification comes from.  ,cad,cfcxxe8,1,t5_2qwha

They will be parallel.Click the Arcstartpoint at the endpoint of one line then click the other lines endpoint.To determine the angle of the arc hold the mouse over the same endpoint BUT dont click.  Draftsight doesnt like to use the same point twice it seems.  Instead drag the mouse slightly to the left.  Youll end up with an imperfect arc.Click that endpoint of the arc and redrag it to the endpoint of the line.

2059254,0,t1_cl17ez1,Im a mechanical engineer  years in the business and a drafter before.I think Solidworks is a decent package for learning parametric D modelling.  Youll find it very similar to Inventor and it wont take much to adapt to NX or Creo if needed.AutoCAD is good to learn as a more traditional drafting package.  If you find yourself having to do structuralarchitectural work piping and instrumentation diagrams working with surveyors etc it can come in handy.  You can use Draftsight which is a free drafting package which is interchangeable with basic Autocad.Aside from that its always good to have some experience with PDM software i.e. Enterprise PDM for Solidworks.  This is always something that we value very highly when recruiting.The software though is secondary to having a good understanding of technical drawing.

2469248,0,t3_2n6hmr,I see that this was posted a few days ago so by now maybe you have gotten your answer but it looks to me as though your force is being applied to only one point.  Instead you should be applying a distributed load on the entire top surface of that part.  You will probably get some bending of the beam but you should see some buckling of the vertical supports as well.   If that is still not what you want why not apply two vertical forces directly over just the vertical supports?

7430352,0,t3_4gzwj0,It sounds like youve been given some great advice. One question I have is this sign made up of a solid block of metal that is being milled or is this something that will be constructed out of sheet metal? Not sure what kind of manufacturer youre dealing with but Im sure they would want every individual piece defined and detailed on its own. If it is sheet metal solidworks has built in tools to take the math out of the calculator for doing bends and flanges. And theyd probably want development details as well as the overall formed dimensions. In your assembly drawings you would start to form your major components by mating them together. Again with inspection dimensions. Here you could have your parts list including stock material Fasteners and the like as well as identify all the fabricated pieces with their part number so the individual details can be referenced.

Having a portfolio in your pocket would be a good idea to differentiate yourself but you dont need to hand it out to everyone you talk to. Maybe make mention of it and see if they take the bait. I wouldnt consider it a requirement that you bring one to the interview though.I generally only see them from new college grads and the content is mostly school work. When I do have someone bring a portfolio from an internship or their past employment I look it over briefly for glaring erorrs to check their attention to detail but mostly Im interested in the content of the drawings so I can get a feel for whether or not theyll hit the ground running. I might ask them a couple questions about the drawings to see if they really understood what it was they were doing rather than just picking up red marks.I conduct between  and  interviews a year for CAD positions just for context.
