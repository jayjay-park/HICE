16305,0,t3_1ub30h,Ok I completely understand this I got honked at last week for the first time in a while and I was seriously uncomfortable. Ive been skinny before  or  years ago and that stuff happened a lot more I had a man in a van whip out a harmonica and sing to me as I walked past ran lol. That stuff seems flattering but its just uncomfortable to me I even still worry that they are mocking me. Long story My weight was always all over the place growing up my current bf of two years I am  met me when we were  I was fat but he fancied me straight away and throughout the years we were best friends.We got together and my weight went from  slim on me to . He said to me recently that he would want me to lose weight he wouldnt dump me over it but it was important to him. This was really upsetting. However I now know he was fair to feel how he did and after losing some weight Im a lot happier myself. He still loved me and we are still just the bestest friends but part of being in a relationship is the attraction.Im going to say something very un PC men like sex women want to be taken care of. Amongst other things yes. Think of it this way you know a man who is kind smart funny but he spends all day playing video games and eating Cheetos and refuses to work would you want to marry him?

22290,0,t3_1ucska,When I had cancer I gained some weight about lbs and I wasnt a slim girl to begin with. However I was still trying to get out and do things despite feeling like utter crap most of the time. So I went to a holiday party hosted by an old high school friend. A guy was there  someone we both had gone to high school with. Ive done a lot of stuff with him in a group but were not friends outside of the group. So anyway Chad sees me bald overweight and says hi and how are you and quickly works his way up to asking Did your weight cause your cancer? I was like dumbstruck. At that point Id been dealing with chemo and nausea and vomiting and bloody diarrhea and being bald and overweight and losing a significant chunk of my boob and scarring from my chemo port and etc. for months but this was like an entirely new thing. Was he REALLY asking me if I caused my own cancer because I was fat? Really???I dont remember exactly what I said to him but it wasnt what I should have said to shut him down. A couple years go by. I lost about lbs. I grew some hair and then as a reward for losing weight got waistlength hair extensions that looked amazing and cost an arm amp a leg. So I was looking awesome  like the best Ive ever looked in my life good.Im on the up escalator at Bed Bath and Beyond and guess whos on the down escalator? Yup Chad. He has about  seconds before we pass each other and he says Hi oh my god you look amazing. And guess who found all that weight I lost? Yup Chad!!Fuck you Chad.,loseit,cegyyyg,126,t5_2rz8w

Im  and do exercise several times a week so maybe I was just burning more calories than you might. I mean you can try it. If you stick to it youll probably drop a lot of weight.

28243,0,t1_cehe8sn,Its not me being kind. There is a very noticeable difference and I really like the fact you are doing a very intense sport. You are making life long changes that will be long lasting. You are building muscle which burns calories even in rest periods and getting involved in sport which can change your lifestyle. It will likely lead to other physical activities that you do because you ENJOY not because you want to be fit. The impressive thing about you is that you arent looking for that magic bullet that takes all the weight off in  days or some unrealistic diet that you cantwont keep up.  pounds is a major accomplishment in anyones book!The reason people close to you dont see it is because they are used to you. Imagine someone comes in and paints your room  very very very slight shade lighter every day for  year. You wouldnt really notice the daily change but it would be drastic in a photo comparison. Its the same with you. You are losing a few ounces a day a great way to do it for lasting results. But because of this you family and friends see a very gradual change. People like us who only see your before and after are blown away. We would all be good to follow your example. ,loseit,cehnbwn,2,t5_2rz8w

Do you have someone teaching you or are you learning online?  ...My partner is still smoking.  We live in a tiny apartment thats only gotten smaller in the past few days.  Everything is looking like a potential murder weapon.  I can only ask for so much compassion.  This isnt his journey.

105637,0,t1_ceqe9r1,One thing about this diet is that they actually allow you to eat as many HMR products and fruits and veggies if you choose that version as you need in order to be full.  More is better is what they call it.  It sounds counterintuitive but the foods are so low calorie and high volume by design that it is very difficult even for super volume eaters to eat more calories than will allow them to lose weight.  This was one of the aha bits for me I think  realizing that if I ate the right things I didnt have to be hungry and could still lose weight.  I think people had told me that before but I hadnt really BELIEVED it so seeing it in action was really helpful.I also got a lot out of the medical supervision from the decision free form of the diet because it gave me a lot of peace of mind knowing that various health factors were being regularly monitored with blood work to make sure that I wasnt doing something ridiculously unhealthy to my body by accident!,loseit,ceqghze,1,t5_2rz8w

What you call a stereotype isnt giving you credit for being an intelligent witty person. Getting rid of old security blankets is the hardest. I suggest get a new haircut first its an easy change that is immediate. Shopping is the hardest thing to do when were having body image and identity issues. How do you decided how do you see yourself as beautiful. Focus on  small thing first then add in more. I hated hearing people say you should do a body image mantra in the morning. New age and sappy as it is every morning i tell myself Im beautiful and that I like  thing about myself. It has started to help with my self confidence and pull me out of focusing on my everchanging body and body image issues. I think the worst part for me about loosing weight is the attention. I dont want the attention for wow you look great that is amazing!. I want it to be a private event.

Probably works out to be the same percentage of body weight though  youre fluctuating lbs which is about  of your weight  it may fluctuate about that much percent wise when you get closer to your target. If youre using MFP you may want to consider tracking sodium as well  once I reduced those  or  killer sodium foods from my diet the fluctuations were much less and more predictably around when I had the highsodium foods. Sodium may be leading you to fluctuate a bit too. ,loseit,ceu5xy5,2,t5_2rz8w

HMR meal replacements . Measuring your own food and integrating back into i guess you could say the real world. Phase  is strictly used to loose weight when you need to loose a lot... Like almost lbs in my case. Once you either reach you goal weight or stop loosing below a threshold you are transferred to phase  where you work with non premeasured portions. In both phases you attend classes on health life styles and nutrition. As part of the classes you meet with an accountability group and every Thursday you call the nutritionist to discuss how your week is going and any challenges you are facing.

Keep doing this because at the very least youre doing things that are good for your whole body.Second BMI means nothing compared to body fat percentage. Your friend whose BMI is higher but looks better supposedly probably has a lower body fat percentage. She probably lifts weights and eats enough protein.If youre worried about how you look A stop it  youre way better off than you were  lbs ago and B lift weights  your scale number may either stay the same or go up but you will look better naked. Your body fat percentage will go down and your BMI will go up or stay the same so BMI is not nearly as important as you may think.Stay at the gym lift weights and remember that weight loss isnt a magic train to happyville.

200452,0,t3_1we4sf,Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort pain difficulty I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well. Theodore RooseveltI know that sounds really cheesy but I actually do think about this when Im in the middle of a hard workout. Its so easy to get caught up want you want NOW versus what you want in the longterm. It might help you to set some goals for what you want in three months or six months from now. My recommendation would be to make gradual changes. Less fast food less or no soda  jumping jacks every day etc. Lose the excuses and just start! The hardest part is starting. Live through that and you wont look back.,loseit,cf19v1k,1,t5_2rz8w
201422,0,t3_1wem6z,First of all its important to understand that your calorie count will ALWAYS be an estimate and not exact.  So stop obsessing.  I often deal with this issue with my clients.  My advice?  Only use MFP for short term experiments to test that the diet in question contains the appropriate nutritional content for the goals at hand.  Once the diet is acceptable MFP goes away.  From that point on its all about building other menu items off of that original diet.  Say you are on a  calorie diet.  You create a menu for the day or week.  You input the menu into MFP to get a macro count.  Once you do a little editing and get to the macro you want with that menu youre done!  Now all you have to do is stick to that menu and substitute different food choices in the same calorie range for different meals.  You know you will always be getting the approximate amount of calories this way. Once you get bored with that menu do it all over again. ,loseit,cf1duwa,1,t5_2rz8w

Anyways it will really help you make better food choices! And keep it simple if youre trying to overhaul your diet. Get in the habit.

OK shes seriously speedwalking but shes not jogging or running at that speed. Thats crazy to me. I can walk up to about . mph but then for my bf he feels comfortable jogging at .. Not everyone is built for speed. Just do what works for you. It doesnt matter what speed or how long it takes you. If it feels difficult and uncomfortable youre doing your job of working out your heart and other muscles and youre burning calories. Keep it up until it doesnt feel so uncomfortable anymore then find ways to make it uncomfortable again. Just keep doing that taking your time so you dont get injured. I like your method of running for  minute at a time to start. I had a coach that used to say You can do anything for  minute. I still tell myself that all the time and thats how I started running. Id run  minutes walk  repeat for  minutes. Then go  minutes. Then run  minutes walk . Then run  walk  etc until I could do  minutes straight then   etc. Now I run at least  miles per workout and it feels like nothing but it took me a while to work up to it.Anyways keep it up! ,loseit,cf2ibbl,2,t5_2rz8w

There have been studies and ensuing lawsuits in the s where the manufacturer of aspartame slowly bought out all of the defense lawyers and essentially bought out the trial. I believe the big issue was liver damage from things like formaldehyde or some derivative of it as an ingredient. As for Splenda it was studied for all of  days and weaseled past the FDA.

So its easy for a few assholes with loud voices to drown out the actual majority opinion.People like this dont understand that losing weight takes time. Youre going to be fat until youre not fat anymore and they cant deal with it for whatever reason. I find the best way to deal with these people is to report them directly to gym management. Everyone deserves the opportunity to work out in a facility that is specifically designed for that activity and to feel supported and safe from ridicule.To avoid it altogether I just go as soon as my gym opens in the early morning.

374378,0,t3_1y8nn5,Ive been a hooper for five years now and just want to say that hooping changed my life. However I dont use it primarily for weight loss and exercise but as a hobby and source of enjoyment. Fitness is a side effect. I think this is where a lot of people go wrong. Its basically a form of dance if you just stand there twirling a hoop around your waist for hours on end it will end boring fast. The other thing is hooping is great exercise when you first start as the body is still very inefficient at keeping the hoop around the waist. As you get better however you will get diminishing returns on your efforts. To counteract this start learning tricks and work towards seamlessly moving from one trick to another. This will enable you to eventually begin moving flowing and dancing with the hoop. Keep practicing and challenging yourself and you will get there. If you cant find any local classes I highly recommend purchasing online classes from Safire at hoopcity.ca. You can purchase online classes from her website for all levels of ability you keep the classes permanently and she gives feedback if you ask her questions or post videos of your progress. Fyi not a big fan of Hoopnotica personallyway too commercialAlso have to second the suggestion that you should not buy a cheap dollar store hoop nor should you buy one of those extra heavy ridged fitness hoops. Start with a larger diameter and thicker tubing as this will allow the hoop to move more slowly while you are learning. As you get better you can move to a smaller hoop.  There are tons of hoop sellers online and they can help you pick out the perfect hoop for your level of ability and body size.Let me know if you have any questions and happy hooping!,loseit,cfjki8v,2,t5_2rz8w

It sounds like you went to fast last time and while you got the results you wanted you didnt build the foundation youd need for a new life.  Which is what I did the first time I lost weight.  Take baby steps. I recommend cutting out liquid calories by drinking water and black coffee law school needs caffeine as Ive been told start with that for a month.  Once you feel like you have that habit lockedin pick another shitty thing you do to yourself and remove it. I believe that people only have so much willpower to use in any given day and law school is going to use most of it up Im sure.

438852,0,t3_1z3sjj,Im a HUGE sweets fan. Huge. Like I could finish a jar of nutella in a single sitting while munching on cupcakes. I also used to eat sweets after every dinner in fact I tricked my body into thinking I wasnt full until I had that cupcake or cake or ice cream or anything really. It took awhile for me to break that thinking. Its literally just a thought process that has to be beaten. First thing I did was throw away every sweet I had in my house. I live alone so it wasnt that hard to do that no one else was eating anything in my cabinets PSecond when I went to the store I would stay AWAY from the bakery cake is my weakness. I also wouldnt buy any packaged snacks because in my mind those  calories are better spent on a real cupcake or slice of cake or cookie instead of some packaged crap. I cut out all ice cream because I was never a huge fan of it to begin with. I pretty much went cold turkey for awhile I was miserable but the only way I was going to break the habit of having dessert after every dinner was to just never have dessert. I can now safely allocate calories to a sugar cookie or cupcake from time to time and I still will eat a donut here or there... but its nothing near what I used to consume. I would just try to throw away everything first and go cold turkey. Everyone has their one food they cant get rid of that is super unhealthy for you pizza pasta soda sweets etc etc. It sucks butt at first it really does. And I caved a few times and bought a  pack of cupcakes from the local cupcakery and would eat like  of them... but then I realized what a waste of  that was and all those calories I just consumed sucks. But I wouldnt worry too much over it lifestyle change not fast change.If you ever have a craving drink a cup of water or watch tv or something to get your mind off it. It sucks but you can do this! Edit This was just my personal experience I had to cut everything out because I couldnt do the one cheat day a week thing  I tried but I ended up tricking myself into everyday being a cheat day and it just got outta control again.

448406,0,t1_cfqktuu,Well I biked to and from to work  days a week which was  miles. If I only worked in the morning I would bike home from work and go straight to the gym. I would start off with a k on the treadmill then I would hit the weights for about an hour. After that I would work on abs for  minutes. After all that fun stuff I would hit the pool for  minutes. I would swim  laps then go to the shallow side of the pool  about  feet and do  squat jumps. Diet wise I had six to eight small meals a day. Lots of chicken salmon tuna  out the can and fresh fish   and beef on my cheat days. Snacks were a MUST for me. I would usually have ants on a log carrots clif bars or low fat cheese sticks! Hope that helps! ,loseit,cfr8q66,1,t5_2rz8w

I wouldnt worry too much about a few onceoff episodes where your calories are either substantially under or over your goals  this is just life and what really matters is the long term average intake. And a pound a week is very reasonable goal unless theres something unusual about your circumstances medicalpsychological conditions you should continue with that and see how things go over the following weeks. You may or may not see a lot of weight drop off quite quickly at first as your body but after that it should continue at roughly the pace you have targeted. ,loseit,cfrmbzw,2,t5_2rz8w

461786,0,t1_cfsl5x0,Thank you!! For someone who has never had good results losing weight  this is a huge deal. I honestly have not worked out a single day... X I plan on changing that soon by walking then moving into running when I get a bit fitter.As for diet I am doing a meal replacement plan called Herbalife. First and foremost I am not one of those people that try to force sell what Im doing on other people. I only speak from my personal experiences. With that being said...I do two Herbalife meal replacement shakes a day and mix them with the Herbalife protein mix and water. That is optional but it has more protein and less sugarcalories than skim milk. I have two snacks and I try to make sure they are at least ten grams of protein and no more than  calories. For my meal I do a high protein meal around  calories. I paired that with the supplements they offer. My calorie intake is no more that  calories over or under  a day. I track it with myfitnesspal.The only thing is what is right for me isnt the perfect fit for you. When I joined herbalife I went to a local club and they did a complete body analysis. That involved a weight inch measurement and a scan that prints out a readout of your measurements. Resting metabolic rate percent body fat lean muscle mass excess body fat ideal protein intake etc. It works for me. Thats all I can say. If its something youd be interested in I highly recommend looking up a club in your area.Not sure if this is true for all clubs but at mine the scan was free and the product came with a one month  money back guarantee. ,loseit,cfsr7jn,3,t5_2rz8w

530380,0,t3_206fzi,Interesting read and unusually strident in tone for a BMJ article I thought. The changes to nutritional guidelines over the next few decades should be fascinating to see how far we end up shifting away from whats become considered conventional wisdom but was based on relatively tenuous evidence.That said I dont think the average rloseit user would necessarily benefit from taking this to heart so to speak. Chasing the science is something that seems to infect a lot of health related and fitness related communities and media and can lead to a lot of nonsense going on in the name of science.The strength of evidence based approaches is when the either the weight of evidence is so undeniable or when the urgency of the situation demands action on the basis of less rigorous evidence. Whilst increased risk of cancer and increased risk of heart disease sound like urgent situations to the lay public its important to remember that public health statistics reflect mechanisms that may or may not be appropriate to your individual situation.Usually the case is that chasing the science ignores the forest for the trees obesity and smoking both have such a major impact on risk of heart disease or cancer that the smaller modifiers are almost insignificant in comparison.This is not to say that I disagree with the article as there is definitely a growing body of evidence to support all of those currently controversial claims. ,loseit,cg0k7r8,2,t5_2rz8w

647278,0,t1_cgddcp0,If it helps try setting a concrete goal instead of saying Im gonna do an hour on the treadmill I would take a piece of graph paper and say Im gonna do  minutes of exercise this month and each box on the graph paper represents  minutes. So that averages to about  minutes a day so if you do more great if not its not impossible to make it up the next few days. But the best part is that by focusing on the goal you may say well Ill do it this afternoon because I do have a goal. So now youve worked out maybe not at the time youd wanted but youve still done it.

650137,0,t1_cge5hdq,Food psychology and evolution is a pretty gnarly field of study. Were genetically predisposed to seek out and consume as many calories as possible in order to prepare for food uncertainty. Famine is still a fairly common occurrence and it was far more wide spread as early as  years ago.I dont believe we can truly disassociate the joy and happiness that comes from eating a tasty dish. If we could we would be able to subsist completely on baby carrots greens and a multivitamin. However it feels like you must have the focus and concentration of a Shaolin Monk to be able to maintain such a diet. Moreover attempts at disassociation will ultimately feel like deprivation.Deprivation is actually a far more dangerous outcome because when cravings become too strong to bear and they will be most people will eventually give in and eat something they want. This frequently leads to shame. Shame that the person just broke their diet. Shame that they feel like they lack the willpower to maintain a healthy eating plan. Shame that eventually leads to people giving up on their plan and gaining all of their weight back. Not only is this the norm the vast majority of people cant maintain this plan because they attempt to deprive themselves of foods that make them happy.A willingness to embrace foods that make you happy but eating them in reasonably small quantities is in my opinion the only way to maintain a healthy diet. I like pie cake cookies donuts etc just like anyone else. My diet wont be broken if I eat  slice of pie every month or if I eat a cookie or two one night during the week.TLDR All work and no play make Jack a dull boy.,loseit,cge65hp,1,t5_2rz8w

I dont like being hungry so I eat loads more vegetables in dinners as theyre high volume for low calories. In the freezer now I have a beef stew chicken curry chicken stir fry and beef chilli con carne all peaked with vegetables all less than  calories per portion. I look up low calorie recipes online and weight watchers recipes. I track everything I eat with myfitnesspal. If I want chocolate or a drink or something I can have it if I have enough calories left over or if Ive burned off more calories beforehand. I eat between  and  calories per day Im  female and Ive gone from  obese for my height to  lbs healthy bmi so far. Im enjoying lifting weights and getting stronger at the moment.

See if it makes a difference or not and then you could lower it to a middle range for safety  fudge factor sake.You could enter your typical foods eaten in a week into nutritiondata.com and see what their calcium and vitamin D levels are and adjust for the amounts you consume and come up with some sort of daily average over a weeks time.,loseit,cgm53gn,1,t5_2rz8w

747307,0,t1_cgp4am0,I completely agree these days it is a crap shoot as to what you are exposed to when you are being raised. To begin with our bodies are really naturally adapted to become fat so to speak they are efficient machines designed to consume as little energy as possible and store as much as possible. The theory is called the Thrifty Gene it explains how based on scarcity of calories in nature shaped our bodies to crave high calorie food  which is why they taste so good and to store fat. As the most efficient systems were the fittest to survive. This also in part explains the underlying addictive mechanism of these foods. The body rewards activities which are favorable to its survival.Introduce high calorie processed foods with high fructose corn syrup starches and lots of complex fats to our natural propensities and the outcome is invariably obesity. The former generations did not have this problem because they were not exposed to these foods. Also they had a far less sedentary existence than we do. Anecdotally I know this as every time I go to my country I lose weight pretty rapidly even when Im vacationing with no real increase in my activity levels. The only things that are really different is that my country still does not have a lot of the processed foods that exist here. Its amazing if you think about it how many calories we have been able to pack in foods one burger is generally well over half an average persons daily intake of fats sugars etc.,loseit,cgp848o,4,t5_2rz8w
747929,0,t1_cgorfb1,I dont frequent this sub and only found it because this post made the front page but I wanted to thank you for posting this.Im thin. Im not in peak physical condition because I am lazy but at  y.o.  tall I manage to stay around  lbs. Out of luck. Pure luck of the draw. Genetics. I take no credit because I dont work out and I could probably eat better. I mean I probably consume about    calories per day but thats not necessarily out of willpower or anything admirable like that.I am ONLY saying this because Ive always been one of those people who didnt sympathize with people who were obese due to poor diet and lack of exercise read the people like me who werent so lucky to be blessed with a turbo metabolism. Im seeing the irony here. Legitimate health problems or medication causing weight gain was one thing but for the rest majority of obese people my impression was on some levels less than favorable.Now Im not cruel. I dont make comments or roll my eyes or treat people like shit because theyre fat. I get along well with the obese people Ive worked with. I have a few friends and relatives that are toeing that line as well. But I would do what I imagine a lot of people do  silently judge secure in my inner superiority which remember is unearned. Genetics baby..That is until right now.Right now I feel like an asshole. And a hypocrite.I dont know what exactly about your post struck a nerve with me or why it has seemed to articulate something I wasnt able to hear before but I realize now how much of a sanctimonious douche Ive been for sitting smugly in my silent judgment of people whose struggles I knew absolutely nothing about.So again thank you for this. Youve opened my eyes and legitimately changed my perspective. I mean you shouldnt have had to but you did.

748253,0,t1_cgpa804,Im not sure if this is sarcasm or not but Im going to hope its not.To help anyone that is overweight or has body image issues which is an underlying result of being overweight anytime they make a good choice they need the positive reenforcement to help change the way their brain associates reward with food.By positively reenforcing the good behavior the person begins to change the way they think. They dont even have to be aware of the change per se but the change is evident in the actions and thoughts of the person. Instead of having to fight themselves to eat smaller portions they do it without a second thought. Instead of going out for that late night froyo they eat some granola or some nuts. These things may not sound like drastic changes to some but its a massive shift in thinking for most overweight people to be able to make healthy choices by instinct instead of by force. Also portion control is critical for overweight people. This is the hardest part about losing weight and it stems back to the over eating. For most we get our dinner plate and we will put a helping of mashed potatoes with dressing a slab of meat loaf and a dinner role or six. What we dont realize is that just by using a normal size dinner plate we are already defeating ourselves. The visual of having that large plate means we put large portions on it to fill it up. Switching to a smaller plate like a dessert plate we still have the urge to fill up the empty plate but we are filling it up with less food resulting in fewer calories consumed. The smaller plate thing may not work for everyone but its something to try with yourself or with a loved one to see if it works for youthem. Another thing you can try is weighing everything. Its an epic pain in the ass but using a scale to maintain proper proportions is extremely beneficial. When an overweight person grabs a snack be it chips or cookies or a slice of pizza or whatever we dont think about the portion. We may sit down and eat a bag of chips that says its only  calories per serving but if there are  servings in the bag we just ate  calories as a snack.In the begging prepping meals in advance will help with portions as we can prepare meals days in advance pop it in the microwave and be eating within a few minutes. This helps get the portion control issue under control. You can also use apps like www.myfitnesspal.com to help you on the path to eating right. All of this can be used to help those that are overweight or struggling with their weight. Learn the right way to eat and help the person in your life learn the same things. It may be a struggle but by helping them with learning to manage their eating habits properly you will help them more than anything else possibly could.,loseit,cgpbzow,1,t5_2rz8w

767450,0,t1_cgri3dk,Sorry this is long but I feel I needed to get this off my chest today.As a currently morbidly obese  lbs  year old male Its hard to find motivation. Words on the internet are words on the internet for a reason. If the person saying them isnt in the same room with you whispering into your ear while you do those last few pushups then when you get up all sweaty tired and sore and look into the mirror you see not a changed person but a sickening disgusting sweaty fat mess looking back at you. And you think what the hells the point. Being fat is easier than being thin. I assume never been thin so I wouldnt know what it feels like for my man boobs to not touch my upper stomach or for my stomach to not lay on my thighs when I sit. Want to know what is I think finally going to push me to my goal weight of finally being below  again since High School? My younger sister asked me to walk her down the aisle in September because we havent had a father since I was . Not only is this for her but for me as well. Five times Ive tried to get in shape either missing the dieting or missing the exercise. This will be the final time I say its time to lose weight. I just did  push ups. I didnt think I could and I know they probably werent perfect but When I was finished I gave a speech to  year old me. I told myself why I was doing this that if I didnt do this I wouldnt make it past . And for someone so scared of death it seems bad form to rush out to meet it. So thats why Im finally trying to get this hulk of a body under control. Not because of what some pretty words on the internet said once but because I want to prove to my deadbeat dad that i can not only be the first of my name to get a college degree but to be the first of my name to not be morbidly obese an alcoholic and a drug user. I want to be there for my family I want a family eventually and I want to be healthier and more confident like Ive never been. I want to say goodbye to the guy who would crack jokes at himself and I want to tell all of those thin girls Ive crushed on over the years that this isnt for them.

770970,0,t3_22ynud,Thanks for the post! Honestly the only pound that feels harder than the last pound is the first one. When you are in the middle and really tuned in and getting into the swing of things it gets much easier. The last one is hard because you are significantly smaller and it takes a lot more work also because you are not as motivated by selfhatred and disgust with the mirror. The first is hard because you literally have to start from nothing and begin to break dozens of bad habits that you have likely practiced your entire life. I think many people are put off at how hard a lifestyle change can be and end up giving up because they feel overwhelmed. I wish they would believe me when I say that it gets SO MUCH easier. You  just HAVE TO  hold on to that bull and not let go till it has collapsed from exhaustion.

823259,0,t3_23iy4h, Not knowing what kind of work you do makes it a little difficult to comment on whether or not you should quit your job or not. If youre around massive amounts of food day inday out I can see where taking some time off would be beneficial. However when you return to work even if its another job youre still going to be tempted by foods. It is so easy to regain the weight. I saw that someone else recommended My Fitness Pal. I second this. Ive lost  lbs in the past  months through MFP. Make sure youre very active and find lots of friends. Its a very motivating site! I recommend watching the show Ruby. Its on Netflix. Very encouraging! She goes through finding personal trainers a doctor nutritionist therapist. I liked the parts of the show that most focused on the  step food addiction part. So much of being heavy has emotion attached to it. If youre serious about taking time off of work maybe find a therapist or councilor to get to the root of why youve gained weight. ,loseit,cgxuudb,1,t5_2rz8w
824095,0,t3_23kk1k,Ive been struggling with this since February. From what Ive been reading there are three possible explanations. You arent tracking calories properly and are actually eating more calories than you think this might be my problem Im still figuring it out. . You are eating too many calories. I know MFP might be saying you should be eating  calories but maybe it should be . This is probably unlikely though and in your case I would think carefully about eating less. . Your metabolism has slowed down. This is where I get confused since I though the whole he never gets fat cause he has a high metabolism!! mentality was wrong and over exaggerated i.e. metabolism isnt as important as we believe. However with the stuff Ive been reading metabolism can actually be the cause for a plateau. For this we have to do some reverse diet slowly increase caloric intake to reset our metabolism. Heres a good article which breaks it down Id look into reverse dieting if I were you. Make sure you do your research before you do this though. Im in the same boat as you been EXACTLY at lbs. since February and Im still looking into reverse dieting. Part of me doesnt want to do it since Im FUCKING terrified of increasing calories and gaining weight. Moreover it requires meticulous monitoring of your calories.One final suggestion I read around here was to binge eat one weekend. Just eat what you want. One user claimed that that alone jump started his weight loss. However this was a personal anecdote and I cannot speak to its scientific merit. ,loseit,cgxy9gr,1,t5_2rz8w
824414,0,t1_cgxyjcs,My problem is Ive had doctors tell me I need to lose weight when I go in for something that is  not weight related. I recently had a high blood pressure read and I went in to my regular doctor to chat about options. Fortunately we monitor over the month and it was normal each time. A high BP read? Definitely time to talk about weight loss because high blood pressure can be exacerbated by obesity. But sorry my strep throat has nothing to do with me being fat. I already know Im fat. I need you to give me fucking antibiotics not lecture me on my weight. Not everyone needs a wakeup call and a doctor saying its time to talk about your weight is not a wake up call for me. ,loseit,cgxzk9d,-2,t5_2rz8w

834021,0,t3_23obon,OP youre not the only one going through the struggle of relosing.  I joined the Navy about a decade ago.  To do that I had to lose roughly  lbs I dont remember exactly.  When I got out of Boot I was  lbs and in the best shape of my life.  Since then Ive let things go to put it mildly. I had a rough couple years after I got out and just stopped caring. I blew up to  lbs or more at my heaviest.Last year I decided to get back to where I was  years ago. I lost  lbs got into the s. Then in the fall I got busy distracted and gained  of the pounds back.  Since January Ive been relosing weight.  Again.  This is the point that Im currently tracking from.  Im down  pounds from the middle of January its mostly retreading old ground but thats only a reason to keep going.Yes it can be discouraging to get on the scale and see that progress is where you were even just a short while ago.  The important part is that youre back at it and focused.  Keep that focus. Find reasons to keep going no matter how mundane or silly they sound. Look at this time as a new start. Believe me mistakes will happen. Setbacks will occur in your journey but that isnt the end.  I understand the discouragement Ive been struggling with it myself.  Take pride in knowing that while youve been here before you havent given up. The fact that youre going at it once again rather than admitting defeat is an inspiration.,loseit,cgz2wn9,2,t5_2rz8w

Dont be that person you will lose a friend if you are. What I DO recommend is lead by example. Call him up or if youre gone get mutual friends to call him and invite him out to the gym with you. Dont make it a big deal if he does or doesnt want to go. Call him up for a game of shinny. Invite him over for dinner and games and dont make a big deal out of eating healthy food when hes there. Dont make it a big deal dont make it obvious and dont mention how concerned you are for his health fat people get concern trolled all the time so even if you are sincere it will seem like a dick move. ,loseit,cgzbt95,8,t5_2rz8w

Obviously dont cut out the apple but maybe swap the pasta and pretzels for another fruit or some vegetables or keep the pasta but have the sandwich be a salad instead.Also maybe switch the daily soda to unsweatened ice tea or diet soda with regular soda being more of a once a week occurrence same with the fruit soda thingyRibena.  Also in the U.S. and I assume your parenthesis are supposed to be American translations a cordial is a type of liquor.  We would probably refer to Ribena as berry soda or berry juice I dont think we have black currant berries here.  For a second when you said you used to drink multiple glasses of cordials a day I was pretty confused since while the drinking age is lower I didnt think getting drunk was common for  year olds in Ireland then I looked up what Ribena was.From wikipediaIn parts of the United States liqueurs may also be called cordials or schnapps while in large parts of the British Commonwealth cordial means a concentrated nonalcoholic fruit syrup that is diluted to taste and consumed as a noncarbonated soft drink,loseit,ch83r2z,2,t5_2rz8w

I am making myself track every bite I put in my mouth on the loseit app. I have lots of friends on there we have a reddit group and I HATE when I know everyone can see that I went over my calories.The best thing you can do is find someone that you can tell anything to and keep each other accountable. My best friend from college and I have been losing weight together for a few months. We have the kind of relationship where we can tell the other person we just ate an entire pack of oreos and half a pizza and there is no judgement. We have both made mistakes and we know how to help each other.Instead of saying you will start tomorrow start right now. If you had a bad breakfast or lunch just wipe that off your slate and start fresh. I know its so easy after  bad meal to just say forget it and eat everything you want the rest of the day.

946907,0,t3_24xy3d,I have recently started working out in the morning so that my afternoons and evenings are free for the fun stuff with friends and family.I had to make sure that I was going to be early enough.  When I wake up at  for my AM spin class I need to have gotten around  hours of sleep.  So if its after  and I havent made it to bed chances are Im not getting up the next morning.  I had to start keeping myself accountable for an early bedtime.  That means that a few nights a week I am in bed witht he lights off before my partner is ready for bed.  If I waited for him to be ready for bed Id never get to the gym in the morning.I also recommend doing some prep work for the next day so that you can just wake up and go workout!  For example  I pack my gym bag the night before and place it near the front door.  I lay my workout gear  out in my bathroom so that I can get right up use the bathroom and get dressed to go.  I pack my lunch the night before so that I can just reach into the fridge and grab it.  From the time I roll out of bed to the time Im in my car on the way to the gym is around  minutes.   The truth is I dont like to workout in the mornings.  Id much rather lay in bed.  But when I sit down at my desk at work early because I got ready at the gym instead of oversleeping at home! I feel a huge accomplishment.  Its so much easier for me to stay on track with my diet because I have already put a lot of effort into having a good day.  I like that when Im done with work I have my entire afternoon and evening free to read a book go on a walk grab a drink with a friend or work on my hobbies.  I have time to prepare a nice meal instead of coming home from the gym hungry and ready to inhale whatever is quickest. So there are a ton of benefits to working out in the morning an almost empty gym helps too! but it doesnt mean you have to like it.  Just make sure that you set yourself up for success by planning ahead the night before.Also I use a totally obnoxious ringtone to wake me up on gym days so that I can barely go back to sleep even if I wanted to!,loseit,chbx4ui,3,t5_2rz8w

Im in graduate school and I deal with a lot of stress and so often its easier to just grab junk than actually cook for myself. What I often try to do is to make a dish I like and cook up enough for several days at a time especially if its something that freezes well or that keeps well as leftovers. Ive been eating mostly vegetarian so this works well with a lot of curries and salads as well as a few other goto meals I like. Ive discovered as time passes that Ive lost the taste for a lot of the junk I used to eat  the last time I had Oreo cookies I almost gagged. Anyway yoga is a good place to start especially if youre recovering from surgery. I started yoga last year because I have back and knee problems degenerative disc disorder and deviating patella and regular exercise was almost totally off limits. It took a while to build up my strength but Ive lost about  pounds total since last year with the majority of that coming off since January when I started daily hourlong practices.

My god Id be sick if I tried eating that amount of calories in one meal nevermind I wouldnt be able to function for a few hours because Id be falling asleep.There are a million and one diets out there on the market.  One thing they all have in common is that you have to eat more than once per day.  Simple.  Again changing your life is not easy.  No one here is ever going to tell you it is.  You will have to give up some things in order to lose the weight.  Okay enough with the Debbie downer  daily physical activity.  Yea you!  Ever though of doing more?  You should be getting at least  mins.  Doesnt have to be tough sweating buckets kind of activity.  Add in a walk or have a longer walk.  With an iPod or whatever youd be surprised how quickly the time goes.  Map out a route to walk online.  Try to extend it every week.  Challenge yourself in the gym if you go to one to try a new activity or weight exercise.  Try a new class.  Go swimming.  For those of us on the larger size swimming is excellent and saves the joints.  Also if youre afraid of people staring dont.  Most people at the pool will probably be cheering you internally for doing something about your weight.  Aquacize classes are great and because youre in the pool you dont always realize how hard youre working because you cant tell how much youre sweating.As for a specific diet ... sound like you need peer support and something that will reteach you how to eat.  Ive done Weight Watchers on and off for nearly  years.  It works.  Im not doing it now because I dislike the online interface and with all my work travel its hard to make the meetings on a consistent basis.  But when I was going it worked.

To work it out for you get an app like my fitness pal and look through that for a rough estimate or for a still rough but more specific number I use the Nike running app put in your weight and height and at the end of the run itll work out how much youve burned based on your distance and speed. Youll be surprised at how much you can burn at a decent pace in even half an hour! Itll definitely slow down accept this and expect it  I find that lbs down the weight loss is much slower but Im starting to see more actual improvements in my fitness. It slowing down is normal and youll need to readjust your regime and calorie deficit as you go. I tweaked these things at every ten lbs I lost. I couldnt really guess how long it would take to get to your goal sorry! Try and get a balance between carbs fats and protein different people use different ratios and dont overthink it but theres a difference nutrionally between  calories of chips and  calories of a healthy balanced meal.

Some women lose a significant amount of their own weight due to the calories it requires to grow a human being.  Others gain a significant amount.  I think the important thing is that you create healthy eating habits now and stick to them.

1174784,0,t1_ci1rxr2,Thank you for the education on thermodynamics which I understand exists and at no point did I ever claim anyone including OP is immune to.However weight loss is not a linear process otherwise it would be  possible to predict a human beings weight loss all the time with just a calorie count.  People do things like consume varying amounts of sodium or have irregular bowel schedules that complicate the matter of weight loss.  Just like you claim nobody is immune to physics nobody is immune to the fact that poop has mass or sodium can cause people to retain water which can cause shortterm variation in weight.Calorie counting is a great longterm weight loss tool.  I have used it to lose every single one of the  lb Ive lost so far but it is at best a line of best fit.  It tells you how much you should lose and gives you a target range to do so but anyone who doesnt acknowledge that short term factors can affect the number on the scale is pretty naive.,loseit,ci1s7ie,1,t5_2rz8w

1176603,0,t1_ci1ze3m,I really am considering a blood test now. I am terrified of needles but I guess that I never really even checked for anemia like I was supposed to. Apparently anemia contributes to sudden periods of fatigue which I do experience during the day...The thyroid thing could explain how I never experienced any change even while eating  calories or doing PX.  Like I said Ive tried different approaches to losing weight with different amounts of calorie consumption. I just base it off the calories per serving because its easy for me to measure and keep track of. My ice cream does not have Stevia this I know. It has something more along the lines of sorbitol or other artificial sweeteners. Which is probably worse I know but I always looked at it as my only vice. I may need to consider ditching the ice cream habit. sighIll have to do my research on cortisol overproduction. Thats one thing that I have never looked into.

1177186,0,t3_27ltna,To repeat the old slogan you cant outrun a bad diet.  The physical reality is its possible to eat in a couple minutes as many calories as a couple hours of exercise burns.  For this reason adding on little bits of exercise here and there is not going to accomplish much of anything unless you know for a fact that you are eating at a caloric deficit.Id highly recommend downloading myfitnesspal and logging everything you eat and drink.  Its also very important not to estimate portions and actually know what the real quantities are because we are notoriously bad at estimating oftentimes being several multiples off.,loseit,ci21xln,3,t5_2rz8w

1179395,0,t3_27m9xs,Two sentences that made a huge difference for me personally Dont eat until you are full eat until you are not hungry.  Hunger isnt an indicator of how much food you want it is an indicator of how much you want foodIf you keep these two things in mind each time you feel hungry it will help you manage your intake. At least it has for me. Whenever I am really hungry I remember that its my body telling me I need to eat food soon not that I need to eat a fuckton of food. I get my meal and as I eat I pay attention to how my tummy feels. Once I no longer feel that hunger sensation I stop eating.People look at me weird now when we go out to eat because I always leave food on my plate. The portion sizes are out of control but thats another discussion.This approach has helped me lose a lot of weight with minimal exercise as most weight gain and loss is through diet. Exercise is awesome and you should do it but your diet can destroy any progress given by exercise.Good luck!,loseit,ci2avoy,2,t5_2rz8w

1211385,0,t3_27z3hw,I think that as far as diets go it isnt the worst you could do. Having said that Im against any sort of diet with strict often arbitrary rules. For example Paleo saying you cant have legumes or peanuts ?!The principles of Keto do call out to me as Im very aware of how damaging sugar is to the human body and so Im a strong advocator of low carb and minimal carb diets.When I hear people talk about slimming world and that they can eat unlimited fruit or that a big bowl of white pasta with tomato sauce is free on their diet it makes me fucking cringe.Popular diets that insist on low fat whilst piling on the carbs and sugars make me really cross because people trust them and then they dont understand what a healthy diet should consist of which sorry weight watchers includes fat!.I am skeptical about what would happen if you lost a lot of weight on Keto and were to try to go back to a normal diet again would you put it all back on? I dont know. At least with Keto they advocate eating loads and loads of veggies brilliant! no sugar perfect! high protein wonderful!. However its really not for everyone. I for one adore plain salty fatty flavours and can take or leave bread pasta and carbs in general so I think I could manage Keto but so many people would find it too hard to stick with.

A pound is  calories so right now youre set up to lose one pound a week which is healthy and sustaintable but even if you are underestimating your calories by  per day you could be delaying your progress also people have crazy flucutuations in weight.

1278637,0,t3_28pkt1,gtI got told by my mother that if I loose the weight too fast I will put it back on easy when I get to my goal.The way to prevent that is to do a lifestyle change not a diet.  For example if after tracking with myfitnesspal for a while you realize literally all of your extra calories are coming from eating out with your friends several times per week and you stop going with them for six months until you lose the weight.  You will be resentful of missing time with your friends and then if you go back to doing the same old things when youve lost the weight itll come right back.  Or if you go vegan for six months and are dreaming about steak then its going to come back.A better approach is to figure out the healthiest thing at the restaraunt trying slightly lower calorie cuts of meat and still eating your treats but just less.  It is a much easier and more sustainable change to say I will eat no more than kg of potato chips per year than to say I will never eat another potato chip again.  ,loseit,cidgpq4,1,t5_2rz8w

You didnt mention whether your gym has a pool but walking in water is good exercise while relieving pressure on your joints. For your foot pain try to put a lift in the shoe of your shorter leg to even out the difference. Also orthotics are helpful for people who have plantar fasciitis. No need for custom ones just look in the supermarketpharmacy. There are some good pictures if you google plantar fascia stretch. Trying doing them in the morning before you stand up and after sitting for a while. To strengthen the foot muscles try picking up a towel off the ground with your toes. Repeating this motion will help strengthen those arches. ,loseit,cij45fb,1,t5_2rz8w

Sort of like if someone has done yoga for years vs someone who has never stretched.

1344824,0,t1_cikv9qb,I think the complaint has more to do with most people at least in the US putting in serving sizes in tablespoons or cups or just as one serving which can vary for foods that dont have labeling. One example would be restaurant food. Not all restaurants put the nutritional info online and portions in the US are huge. In addition not everyone understands the difference between serving and portion. I have seen someone put one serving for an apple but I have seen apples that can weigh one pound per apple not kidding and not exaggerating. I have seen apples so small I almost mistook them for a plum. One serving is vague and really not helpful. EDIT spelling correction,loseit,cikwpv7,5,t5_2rz8w

If you are overweight though that is not a surprise as any BCPs effectiveness is reduced in those who are overweight and indeed the heavier you are the worse it is. So yes weight fluctuations due to hormones are possible. Surely your doctor isnt concerned over simply a lb weight gain though? lbs fluctuation could mean you just had a big glass of water that you havent peed out before getting on the scale. Even hormones aside lbs fluctuations are quiet normal. Is he really commenting on just lbs of weight gain in a week or is he perhaps commenting on a month where you show lb weight gain so if you did put on lbs in the last week that means no progress for the rest of the month. ,loseit,ciocg0d,1,t5_2rz8w

1383900,0,t3_29yisf,When youre just starting out making the habit is more important than what you do. Just pick a machine and do something on it for as long as you comfortably can a few times a week. If youre very out of shape you might find some things too hard right now and thats fine too. Just go regularly and get active. After youve improved your cardiovascular endurance a bit and want to do a program I suggest rCK. I know you said that you dont want to build muscle but weight training is important for preserving the muscle you already have during weight loss. I suggest looking at the FAQ at rfitness to find a program. An hour of cardio gets super boring anyway and lifting can make things more fun. Its good for you and will make your body look better at the end of fat loss.And finally remember that diet is the number one factor in weight loss. You cant outrun a bad diet!

1387194,0,t3_29zz9w,White spirits basically  gin and vodka combined with a lowcalorie mixer diet tonic etc if you dont think thatll get the piss taken out of you by your friends hopefully not. The benefits of a mixer over shots is that your drink lasts longer youre less likely to down it and go straight for another. As for the food keep the calories down during the day and eat something heavy and satisfying at night before you begin to drink. I set an alarm on my phone for am with two bullet points  I hope you arent making a fool of yourself and  dont you eat it. Also while I wont dissuade you from drinking it was a big part of my college experience and in my country drinking is practically the only way people bond I would remind you to take it slow. Its really not about hitting the limit as fast as you can and then going beyond it. Enjoy what you drink enjoy the time with your friends say no to the beers and the shots and the chugging. Consider on  night out of  being the guy who goes easy on the drinks and makes sure the vulnerable get home safely. Its a caring move and itll help save your waistline.,loseit,ciq60dh,9,t5_2rz8w
1387418,0,t3_29zqyz,Sometimes reading all these stories about people losing  lbs in a month can be discouraging. It can be hard to lose weight so your depression is understandable. The easiest way to control how much weight you gain is to control what you put in your body. Start with small things. Switch out soda for water. And then every few days switch out something unhealthy for something healthier. Make small goals and stick to them. Aim to lose  lbs a month. Celebrate these goals. Before you know it your small goals will add up into a milestone. If it helps to think of it in another way weight loss will help reduce your diabetic medications. Make it your goal to have your doctor decrease your dose every visit. Show him that youre improving. Just remember youre capable of anything.

Nearly all the strength programs Ive seen recommend taking a day off between sessions the idea is that you do the work one day then take a rest day so your body can adapt heal and get stronger.  Running may not put the same stresses on your body as lifting but its still possible to get overworked and burn out.  If youre having these CRAP days on a regular basis it might be a sign that you could use another rest day.  Then again sometimes a bad day is nothing more than that so dont panic if its an occasional thing. And BTW Im seriously impressed with you working up to  minutes of running!

These studies didnt even begin until  really  so its no surprise that its not remotely as well studied as something like alcoholism and that were only starting to hear about it as laypeople. Personally I think addictions are addictions whether its alcohol junk food gambling porn heroin whatever. Its a part of our brain that tells us we MUST have that thing now now now. And I do believe that some people are more naturally susceptible to this than others. Scientific article or not that NYT article is worth a read.

Which has really always been my issue I know what I need to do and I know what Im capable of I just lose speed fast. And part of that issue is I have ADHD which I take medication for but it doesnt work as well as I think it should. So I need to catch myself when Im feeling motivated to find a new doctor to try something else.  When it does work it falls short and by the time I get home from work Im ready to crawl into bed.  And right now is a perfect example I had a headache most of the day and had no energy so when it started to go away I took my Vyvanse and now its am and Im feeling awake and motivated and ready to do some SHIT. But tomorrow afternoon who knows. Its super unpredictable and incredibly frustrating. Im  yo female  and lbs. I have literally weighed the same since I was in th grade the only difference has been my proportions because Ive gone down two sizes since. I also have PCOS which I need to go back to the doctor for. When I was diagnosed I was taking spirinolactone and metformin for it which helped when combined with a super low carb diet. However between working crazy hours and long days and so much stress I was thrown off track completely. This was yrs ago. I havent taken the medicine since and my weight went up to the same its always been. This is turning out super long. My challenge has always been motivation and organization. I know what I need to do  I just need to do it. My doctor told me he wants to see me weigh between lbs my goal is to get below lbs even if its just .. I honestly dont know when I weighed less than lbs. My fitness goal is to first use my work discount to join the local Y and go at least x a week. Im not aiming high to go twice a week after not going to the gym for years is kinda big for me. Other goals include cutting down on regular soda cutting down on groceries and getting meals ready in advance plan my meals and use Loseit.

Especially when it comes to losing weight I know many examples where kids struggle to stick to their workout plan organize their diet and etc. while their parents who are usually the ones who should actually participate even more then a kid if you know what I mean  are just to lazy to do what their kid is doing and even show some resistance towards it.

For example one of the things that I do I try to plan my meals for the week and before I grocery shop I take note of everything I will need for those recipes and only shop from that list. Since I dont always have time to cook for every meal often times my dinners are also my lunch for the next day. I will also try to weigh and log it for the next day as well so I dont end up making excuses for why I should just go grab something from somewhere more convenient. Ive also made a habit of logging my calories every single day no matter what. Sure there is good food and bad food to an extent but I find that as long as I hold myself accountable and am honest with what Im eating it serves as self motivation for staying within my calorie limit.You can do this!

It does help at the start if it stops you from doing and getting in to the cycle of guilt but it is not going to end if you are afraid that you cant control yourself. For me every eatingbody issue comes back to control and feeling like oh god Im out of control is a horrible feeling so naturally you want to change the circumstances youre in to avoid that.

This time Im almost at the  mark and Ive found that eating better and smaller portions and just pushing through the hungry feeling even if you truly have eaten enough the new diet becomes enough and that hungry feeling goes away.Something else that sort of helped was doing that ridiculous lemonade diet the one with syrup and cayenne pepper ick. for a cleansing experience.  Yes I lost weight all gained back within the weeks following and yes its super unhealthy to drink only lemonade I stupidly learned this after the fact but it gave me the realization that I could get through that hunger and I really did have it in me.

Foods from your diet is a very big leap in the right direction. It may be all you need to do. Unless you are doing full on Keto its probably not necessary to do any more on that front. Youll still need to keep an eye on your overall calorie count  calories in pure protein and fat is still too much but getting rid of the major sources of carbs help out quite well. And then theres the added benefit of feeling full for longer. In truth you could eat nothing but carbs all day and still lose weight. It still depends on how many calories you are putting into your body and how many you are burning. Carbs just have a tendency to make you hungry faster and they do bad stuff to your blood sugar making you crave them anymore. But you can still have some bread at lunch if you want.

1729236,0,t3_2e6v01,I think one of the biggest motivators for me to get back into weight loss was the pain. There was no reason for my chest to be aching all the time... I would constantly feel off... Best of luck. Remember that losing weight does not mean that you cannot have a cheeseburger or a cheesesteak every now and again. They are two of my favorite foods and Ive had at least  of each since I started losing weight... Its all about moderation... I find that having cheat days though I never went above my calorie limit on those days keeps you going  you dont want to look at life as I can never eat that again!!!,loseit,cjx4vd7,2,t5_2rz8w

1737146,0,t3_2ec92m,First off I would recommend focusing on becoming healthy and fit so you can be more active in life. Rather than focusing on the idea of loosing weight  yes its important but the weight loss will come naturally with a healthier lifestyle.  As for your family  obviously its an issue if your mom is bringing home fast food. Tell your mom you want to eat healthier and that means no fast food. If you have no choice and that is where everyone is going for dinner try and pick the best option available  Turkey sandwich no mayo kind of thing. I was addicted to soda amp late night snaking too. I opted for the sparkling water but I can tell you after a few weeks you wont crave it anymore.  For snaking make sure to have healthy options available  drink a tall glass of water before you do eat and ask yourself if youre really hungry or just bored.  Finally since your  I would encourage you to take up a sport at your school. You have so many options available you might find a new hobby that you love like running or cycling or weight lifting.   The most important thing is you make decisions to help live a healthier and longer life. Best of luck to you. ,loseit,cjy4qqn,2,t5_2rz8w

My roommates and I had roommate dinner once per week throughout university.  We would all make a dinner together. I personally wouldnt want to have to lie to someone I am living with.  Besides the fact that if you go that route you will have to maintain a lie for the entirety of living with her you shouldnt feel uncomfortable around someone that is your friend and roommate. It took me years to feel comfortable telling people when I was on a diet.  Now it just rolls of my tongue when people ask me to go out to eat or eat foods I dont feel I need.  Just be honest and own it.  It is your lifesytle not hers. If she doesnt respect you taking care of your body then she isnt being a good friend,loseit,ck1lsg4,3,t5_2rz8w

Understand her point of view assure her that you are committed to her but that you need her to support you through this and not hold you back. Youll find it a hard conversation to have but if you are able to leave it with a positive resolution then your relationship will be stronger for it.Side note great job on starting CK!

1918105,0,t3_2glpw3,Well you simply get back on it. No regrets Its going to be difficult to stick to a certain routine of eating throughout all your life even though thats what I suppose most of all feel the most comfortable with once we get properly started. In practicality however thats not really how it goes. I dont even think that is how it should go. Everything in moderation as they say. If you get a weekend or a week on holiday or whatever you should not be bad for not using my fitness pal or eating out a bit more. Just do it honestly. You dont have to overdo it simply because Oh well might as well go all out while Im at it!. Just stick to moderation but allow to enjoy yourself as well.Then when the holiday weekend with the family or whatever it is stops then you simply go back to your regular healthy eating habits. At least Ive found this works great for me. You cant allow yourself to let your eating habits be easily broken simply by going off course for a few days because that might very well happen. Gain the strength to allow yourself to enjoy in moderation from time to time and then once thats over just go back to your old routine. This way it really doesnt have any impact on your overall health because the times where you might be a bit more unhealthy becomes statistical anomalies in an otherwise healthy lifestyle So to sum it upWhen you get out of a routine simply go back into it. Thats the only way to do it. Dont let small bump in the roads become potholes theres no need to. Dont regret what youve done because what is done is done. Look forward instead. It will be a meaningless thing in the bigger picture.,loseit,ckkbh5y,4,t5_2rz8w

2016739,0,t3_2hu9un,I dont have one of those magic switches either but as Ive worked on eating less I have lowered my tolerance for overly sweet or fatty foods. And its good to stick to a strict diet for a while to cleanse your pallet but dont hold out so long that you end up taking a spectacular swan dive off the wagon. I think one of the biggest things thats helped me is learning to cheat wisely. Just taking a minute to stop and ask myself if its really really worth it has been enlightening. A lot of food smells or looks wonderful but when you really get down to it its not that great Im looking at you McDonalds. A few moments of weighing how it will really taste versus how much I will regret it afterwards has saved me a lot of calories. So those fries that smell so good but will probably be stale and cold? Ill pass. But cookies fresh out of the oven? Hell yes Ill be extra good tomorrow. And pay close attention to when your treats stop tasting fantastic.

2041740,0,t1_ckzbpns,I measure everything and log it into My FitnessPal. If youre just starting out  Id recommend doing it for a little bit  youll be surprised at how much youre consuming.  I graduated high school at  lb and needed to change  ASAP. I discovered the gym first  fell in love with weight lifting and running.  I still wasnt as fit as I wanted to be  so I looked into improving my diet.  I started with a standard LFHC low fat high carb. It didnt work for me  I gained weight back.  Eventually I found my way to Paleo which dropped a whopping  lb and then to  the ketogenic diet which got rid of another . I broke my sugar addiction. I made a few other lifestyle modifications  such as hacking my sleep taking some vitamins  incorporating yoga and meditation into my daily routine.  I still work out like a fiend because I love it and it makes me feel good  not as much to lose weight. Right now Im at  lb American size  pants  visible abs  minute mile run active  happy and healthy. Recently I got myself a food scale  out of curiosity  and found out I was under estimating my calorie intake.  I modified  and am looking forward to dropping another  lb after which I think Im done with weight loss. My advice to you start out by just tracking what you eat. Look at the information bar of this sub  there should be a TDEE calculator in there  it should help you figure out what your daily calorie intake needs to be.  Then decide which diet you would like to try  look at vegetarianvegan  paleo  keto  Mediterranean they all have pros and cons. Once you decide  follow the diet within your allowed number of calories. Track everything  and watch pounds come off you should see results within  weeks depending on the diet  so be patient. Start a workout routine  walking is a great start  even if you walk  minutes a day now and work your way from there.  Join a gym  but if you cant  look into bodyweight progressions pushups  crunchers  etc.  Maybe find a sport that you enjoy and join a team.  The goal is to find a healthy diet and lifestyle that fits your needs and that you can stick to. Dont go on a fad diet cabbage soup  juice cleanse  etc. If its not sustainable for the rest of your life  it wont work in the long term.  Dont cut your calories too drastically again  unsustainable  you will fail and get discouraged. Dont think you can outworkout a bad diet you cant trust me  I tried.  Dont let other people shame you or sabotage your progress.  If you dont have supportive friends and relatives  find some new friends. Also  dont be afraid to change or tweak if something is not working for you. Your body is unique  and what works for me may not work for you  do your own research. Sorry for the wall of text!  Hope this helps. If you have any questions  youre more then welcome to inbox me. Good luck  and good health! ,loseit,ckzcmah,8,t5_2rz8w

2063834,0,t3_2ie7lb,Me eating an entire family sized bag of potato chips and then wanting more was one of my...wake up moments. A giant wtf is wrong with my body something is clearly fucked up and broken.gt Food is delicious my brain wants me to eat itYes food can be delicious. Did you yourself want to eat what you did? Or was it simply cravings that your instincts gave you?gt Yesterday I went to  and I ate three spicy hot dogs with mayo and cheese sauce a chili cheese nacho three donuts two candy bars and an entire family sized bag of Doritos.None of this is delicious! This is junk food. Shitty crappy FAKE FLAVORED junk food. Youre addicted to food that is fake and made to be addicted you are not addicted to delicious food. Recognize the flavors your body is addicted to are fake are not real and your palate is skewed because of this. Luckily you can change this entirely.gt  Im so afraid that I am going to become one of those bed ridden dudes that I see on TV but I just cant stop.You can stop and you will stop. Repeat this over and over and over everyday it doesnt matter if you believe it. I can stop and I will stop I love myself. There is a bigger issue going on that youre not addressing. Youre eating emotionally. Think back have you always eaten emotionally? What do you usually think about when youre eating? When did you start eating emotionally uncontrollably? Eating like this is a symptom of you having an unhealthy mental state about yourself and your life. First accept this then try to figure out what is bothering you and why.I would recommend something extreme it is a very very simple medical based diet which makes it easy to stick to in that way and you will drop fat very quickly. Give The Rapid Fat Loss Handbook a read. It works. It will change your life.If you want something less extreme go LCHF you can eat tasty fatty food like alfredo and queso and bacon and lose weight healthily. You dont need to count calories. You dont need to exercise even. You can lose weight quickly without doing so the only stat I would really want to pay attention to is your protein intake. Make sure to get at least g a day if not closer to g a day. Protein will make you full as fuck and will help preserve your muscle.,loseit,cl25px4,1,t5_2rz8w

Plenty of skinny people hate their body its not some magical remedy.Lose weight because you LOVE your body not because you hate it. You dont want to help something you hate do you? Repeat as much as you can as corny as fuck as it sounds I love myself I love my body. Soon enough your mind will believe it and youll feel a million times betterempirically proven.Lift heavy weights x a week utilizing a full body routine you can do cardio on off days brisk walking is sufficient.However more important than exercise for weight loss is diet. Make sure you eat at least g of protein a day whole foods only plenty of veggies cut out refined carbs and sugary drinks and fill the rest with carbsfat as you want. You can very well cut your calories to  a day too your TDEE is around  a  cut is not excessive but if you think youll better stick to  calories then do that youll still lose about lb of fat a week.,loseit,cl4ypx8,1,t5_2rz8w

2131440,0,t1_clap7w8,gt counting calorie lifestyle change but I can never manage to keep up with it if I cook for myselfThen it wasnt a lifestyle change. Some ideas Look into semiperpared meals e.g. prewashed salad mix precooked plain chicken which can be tossed on a salad or eaten as chicken etc.  Or cook several meals worth at once and eat leftovers freeze them for a few weeks later if you dont like eating the same thing over and over. Cooking for  sucks but cook  or  dinner portions and you only have to cook  times a week for all your home made dinners Dont feel like cooking? Then just make a sandwich. Or have some cold cuts some cheese and fruit. Meals dont have to be elaborate and time consuming to prep.  Or cook in bulk on the weekend or just keep eating the same kinds of foods youre already eating but eat less of them. You can lose weight eating nothing but pizza if you just eat less pizza.  Ask your friend if she would be willing to go beyond just casual advice and take you on as a client. Losing weight is about what and how much you eat but theres so much more that goes way beyond that like how to deal with lacking motivation temptation set backs holidays family etc. Discussing these things  or in a group setting such as weight watchers where youre discussing with your peers who are in a similar situation can be better for many than just having a dietitian tell you these things. Though mine was great I found at working through these thingsSo funny and I dont mean funny haha thing is that regardless if you have the surgery or not this is something you still need to sort out. What happens to all so many people who only half heatedly want to lose weight or rather they want to lose weight but they dont want it to actually be hard is that they initially do well with weight loss surgery but then because they have not learnt to eat properly they just end up putting the weight they lose right back on. This is why really WLS has to be a last resort and after youve really really put in the effort. From what youve said so far that doesnt at all sound like thats the case with you. ,loseit,clar49s,4,t5_2rz8w

I cant count the number of times I have said Im tired of this! Starting Sunday Im really gonna buckle down! I might do ok Sunday sometimes I would even make it as far as Tuesday or Wednesday. But then Id forget to bring my lunch to work and Id end up going to McDonalds. Of course from there my natural response would be to try to excuse my behavior. Well I made it pretty far this week. I guess Ill try again next week. I did this for YEARS my friend. In my opinion its the biggest reason you see people on diets never lose any weight. They use it as an excuse rather than sticking to it. Do yourself and your dad a favor. Count your calories give it more of an effort than anything else in your life. Start now never let that shit get out of your head. Before you know it staying below  cal will become a habit and you wont even have to worry about it.

No one should be eating out regularly especially someone at all concerned about money.Juicing is not healthy. Juicing doesnt give you control of your dietbody that you do not already have.Having stable blood sugar does not change that glucose is essentially toxic to a diabetic which is why you need insulin added to your body to begin with. Diabetics imo should be on low carb diets for life it makes no sense for them not to be. To then drink nothing but sugar as a fast...is an absurd consideration to begin with for a diabetic.,loseit,cletnv3,1,t5_2rz8w

Ive had a very stressful year and just felt ran down and stressed out and completely at a breaking point. I went to an endocrinologist because I was convinced that it was my thyroid. I had convinced myself that it must be physical because I could not deal with the idea that it was mental. Anyhow after getting the test results from the doctor and hearing that everything was normal. He told me in his office that a more common reason for my lack of energy and the constant inability to keep up with my family was more likely due to depression. I knew he was likely right as I cried in his office. Since then I have decided come hell or high water I am going to take control of my life. I have changed my eating habits and I have been exercising everyday. I have actually gotten to a point where I look forward to it. I bought a vivofit which just keeps me moving. I love it! I have started logging everything on myfitnesspal. I also started seeing a therapist. It has only been  days but I have gone from  lbs to  lbs in  days. I know that I have a long way to go until I get to where I want to be but I am taking pride in my small victories.

You cant overeat and undereat at the same time.  I think some people do manage to alternate between a deficit and a surplus enough within a period to spend a week or two losing fat then a week or two gaining muscle... but its very deliberate.

There are a few of ways you might be able to fix this but Im not really sure what issue youre having so I trust that youre looking into it on your own.  I will let you know though that I have started sleeping better since losing the weight as I had developed sleep apnea.  Not sure if this is similar for you but it sucked.The biggest thing with dieting is consistency.   calories a week will generally work out to the same as  a day taking water weight and daily things like that into account.  Just try to keep them on average below  a day and dont get discouraged if you have a few days over so long as you get back on it afterwards.Later on once you have figured out what you need to change in your diet perhaps you could cook all your meals for the week on Sunday or something so you know how much you have per day.

2226518,0,t1_clmu54g,It absolutely is. Fat makes you fat isnt based on facts and is outdated. The statement is only true because it has calories and eating too many calories can lead to being overweight.Sugar absolutely does turn to fat in the same way that eating fat turns to fat on your body. Its the exact same process except eating fat leaves you satiated longer leading to feeling less hungry between meals. The amount of sugar in the average diet is far and away a much bigger issue than the amount of fat. Fat also doesnt cause the cocainelike rush of chemicals that lead to the high possibility of addiction. gtSugar will never turn into fat.It absolutely will if you eat too much of it. ,loseit,clmueba,3,t5_2rz8w

A morbidly obese person would most likely use an elliptical at the lowest setting meaning they would not burn as many calories as the app says since its set to a moderate setting.

I did some blood tests. The results were I had high blood pressure high cholesterol and perdiabetes. My triglycerides were high in the s. My doctor prescribed Metformin lisinopril mini aspirin amp Simvastatin for me. The doctor also said that I need to lose weight and eat more healthier.So it has been a month almost that I started all these medicines. I have been trying to walk more. I have been walking up and down my apartment buildings stairs when I cant or forget to walk. I am trying to drink more water than anything else. I have begun eating things I would never eat like salads and avocado. I was lbs before going to the doctor. Last time I was there I was measured at lbs. I weighed myself yesterday night and I was lbs. on my scale.I am not going to say it hasnt been rough so far. I have been tempted by sweetschocolates. I do have one always making sure its a mini barbite size every now and then. I feel like shit afterwards because I know it isnt good for me. I feel mad at myself even if it is only one. I have cut out soda. If I have to have one I do diet. Otherwise I drink water as much as I can. I try to eat as much fish nuts lean meats occasionally veggies as I can. I am more aware of the amount of food I eat. I try not to use salt or butter.I think I need better direction. I think I am doing ok but I think I can do alot better. My personal goal is to be down at least  pounds for now. To me thats realistic. If I do more the better. I also want to be off medications. I dont want to worry about having a heart attack. I dont want to worry about being scared about dying at a young age. I know it will be alot of hard work but I can dedicate myself to it.Any help with what to avoid. What to try.

2288827,0,t3_2lggsq,Check out herbalife its a shake and protein supplement and they have some snacks and things as well. Im having a lot of success feeling satisfied full and just...healthy. I dont know I feel a difference in my body. For ready to eat meals I really feel some sort of supplement or shake is ideal. If you blend it with ice it feels more filling too. Also to lose weight challenge yourself to a high intensity training regimen. ie you want to be doing longer periods of really hard work and very short earned breaks right now its  on . minutes off for me doing  stations with multiple exercises each. There are a lot of gyms that have classes some will have a trial period and colleges might have them included in tuition. Otherwise you can make your own but you have to STICK TO IT. Trust me its hard when someone isnt there pushing you correcting your form etc. Good luck! ,loseit,clum5y3,-2,t5_2rz8w

2316304,0,t3_2lswtu,Hey there welcome to rloseit!The FAQ goes on at length with useful info and theres lots in the replies that have already been posted so Ill just share my experience with weight loss and what has worked well for me.Ive tried a ton of different weight loss methods but the only thing that has worked consistently for me is counting calories. Based on one of your replies below it looks like youve downloaded MyFitnessPal  thats great. Put in your info  height weight how active you normally are on a daily basis your goal weight how much you want to lose per week etc  and it will spit out a daily calorie goal for you calories consumed minus calories exercised. Track what you eat very stringently and be consistent. Diet is the primary factor in losing weight.On top of that exercise while not the biggest factor in weight loss  many people have successfully lost lots of weight without working out at all is helpful. I personally find that Im much more successful in weight loss when I combine better eatingcalorie counting with exercise because  it makes it feel like more of a lifestyle change rather than just depriving myself of foods I enjoy and  once you start realizing just how much exercise it takes to burn off  or  calories it makes you really rethink that bag of chips that you might have otherwise eaten without a second thought. Now when I look at snack foods that have  calories or so I think to myself wow that would take me  minutes of exercise to burn off and its far easier to just decide not to eat this than it would be to eat it and then burn it off later. Im a big fan of running and biking but if either is too strenuous try going on long walks  they burn more calories than you might expect and theyre easier on your body than higherimpact forms of exercise.Youre already taking the first step by deciding that you want to get healthier and posting here for advice so I really hope you commit to it and do well!

2318606,0,t1_clyadhr,Your key here is probably going to be portion control then. If your host doesnt have one go get a kitchen scale. Learn how to weigh what you eat and make the best estimates possible when you can. If youre living on someones good graces youll have to do the best you can with whats offered. Its really hard when youre not cooking for yourself so here are some basics to help you out Lots of veggies. Potatoes are not a vegetable theyre a starch. This is true of corn as well. Leafy greens are good and try to eat a rainbow every day for micronutrients. Cut back on bread potatoes corn pasta and other starches where you can. Theyre fillers but theyre also loaded in calories. Once you start measuring what youre eating youll see what I mean.  Eat sufficient protein but not too much. If youre not working out you wont need as much to maintain muscle mass. Check out this calculator to help you figure out what you want to eat. Move as much as you can. If youre at school all day mostly sitting and working all night not sure here you may not be moving much. Where you can take the stairs walk from place to place and if you can even stand at work or in the back of some of your classrooms just give a headsup to your profs it will help. Its small but everything counts. ,loseit,clyalj1,1,t5_2rz8w

2323995,0,t1_clyxg6c,I would agree with this comment. Anorexia and bulimia are not things you want to mess with. A professional psychologist has tools and techniques that most people of Reddit myself included are not going to have.The best guess I would have to help is to track an enjoyment to calorie ratio. Perhaps consider both present and future enjoyment? The idea being finding food that fits your entire life not just the moment. Once you got those foods just buy them every week because they are part of your no guilt arsenal. The hope is to enjoy a consistent level of calories.Again a professional is going to be WAY better at this than me.,loseit,clyyjzt,1,t5_2rz8w

They also eat differently depending on whether theyre building muscle or cutting fat at the time.  My own goals are  carbs  fat  protein.   Outside of hitting my calories I dont pay much attention to anything except exceeding my protein goal.  This has resulted in an actual weekly intake averaging  carbs  fat  protein.

Its really only your calorie averages over the course of a week that matter so maybe you could attempt to take advantage of your medicinal swings to regular caloric intake.For example you eat  caloriesday  days a week on the days that youre medicated. Then eat  caloriesday  days a week on the days that youre not.

However when youre losing weight with diet and exercise youre fighting to lose every freaking ounce. And youre busting your ass doing it. Most post op patients lose a large amount of weight within a short period of time verses busting your ass in the gym and waiting for the pay off. Theres almost instant payoff with surgery. Do I think thats always the case? No.  I can kill myself during workouts and adhere to a strict diet and see no change. Diet and exercise still breeds the same eating disorders and scale obsessions.

Anyway you do have some notions that WLS is a cheat.  Its not it is a tool.  Yes a few people do take it too lightly and some minority patients and surgeons get into a rush to do it.

Your post also doesnt indicate how long youve been working out so Im a little confused here...Beginner status stretches anywhere from  months by benchmarks on how much you can lift at your body weight or by not being able to progressively overload in a linear fashion. So you decide if youre a beginner or not. Have you read the rfitness faq on cutting? Just read that. As long as you have a moderate deficit no more than  off your TDEE eating enough protein and continue to lift youll be fine during your cut.

If you try and cut back just a little every day or week you will eventually be where you want to be and making some serious progress.Or just cut it out totally and feel like shit for a few days while you adjust.  Quicker progress but you will have to fight the cravings and rely on your will power to get you through it.Its a tough call and its up to you how you want to do it.  You know yourself and your body better then any of us.  And if you stumble along the way so be it.  Get right back to it.   bad day out of  still makes for an awesome week.  And you dont have to give up on sugar for life.  If it suits you throw in a cheat day.  Just focus on doing a little better every week and you will get to where you want to be.  You can do this!,loseit,cn89pe5,5,t5_2rz8w

2680268,0,t3_2qph3i,People might disagree with me here but I think there is nothing wrong with aestheticallybased goals as long as your pursuit of them doesnt lead to unhealthy habits. If however you find that youre sinking back into unhealthy habits you may need to reevaluate or seek counseling. I too have dealt with eating disorders and found that I was hypersensitive about falling back into old patterns when I finally decided to try to lose some extra weight. One thing that has been proven to help with confidence and self esteem is weight training. It gives you goals to look forward to beyond just weighing less or looking a certain way. You gain a certain pride from seeing yourself getting stronger. ,loseit,cn8fjwk,3,t5_2rz8w

Im  and just under lbs in my s.  Im supposed to eat something like  calories a day and I might hit  most days.  Same deal I dont really feel hungry but as weird as it is I dont really lose weight either.  My metabolism is probably really fucked up.  Ill eat a couple of eggs and yogurt for breakfast banana .  Lunch usually out with coworkers  and I frequently make salads for dinner with lots of protein on them but according to myfitnesspal that comes in around  calories also.  Even if I add a protein shake before bed that only adds another  which means Im still  short for the day.  Obviously my resting metabolism isnt requiring  calories or I would lose weight.

2813662,0,t3_2sbbxj,Lets unpack this a little. You lost your severemorbid obesity because of your valid concerns over damaging your health concerns that included familial history.  Those concerns are over.  But youre unhappier partly for cosmetic reasons.  Think about that  and dismiss that part of your unhappiness as irrational. But I can tell you something about losing a lot of weight quickly  you dont leave yourself much room to learn.  Even though you learned a lot about the food you ate to lose it quickly that kind of eating doesnt give you a lot of leeway to eat moderately.  You only know two worlds  the world of no control and the world of tight control.  Now that the very real danger is over you can take it down to  lb. a week or so and have a few hundred more calories to spend.  The rationale before when you were losing quickly was to lose it as quick as possible.  The thinking now needs to be more exploratory  what would it be like to have a pizza and beer night  how would I make a night like that fit into a reasonable week?  The answer to fear is experience and information.  You dont just need to think about these things you need to try it.  And in trying sometimes youll win and sometimes youll lose  and that failure is as important as the success because youll realize that a mistake is not only nonfatal it doesnt necessary even mean youll gain weight that week.  In a situation where youll eat  calories in a week a  calorie mistake is hardly even a rounding error.  So tap on the brakes a bit in your losing  still keep losing but start exploring.  Ive set mine to lose  lb. a week as I move from BMI  to BMI   the real test of success is whether youre under  over the next SEVERAL YEARS.  Now that the danger has passed its okay to take the time you need to learn that.Now about that mirror  Hope that helps!!,loseit,cnnwm3i,46,t5_2rz8w

2840543,0,t1_cnqufjy,The symptoms you are describing are not what most people report when they cut bad foods from their diet. Most people feel better and I suspect thats largely just psychological driven by feeling better emotionally about what theyre eating but feeling worse and being noticeably irritable and tired seem like huge red flags.You really need to make an effort to eat a complete balanced diet. What you describe sounds weirdly limited and very unlikely to supply adequate protein and fat. The symptoms youre experiencing are not going to go away over time if theyre caused by your diet.You really do need to track your food so that you can see the macronutrient breakdowns as others have suggested and make decisions based on that. I would suggest you at least add a couple ounces of nuts or peanuts to your daily food intake right away to supply some of the fat and protein that your body needs to work right. But that wont eliminate the need to actually track your diet properly and start assembling a proper meal plan that meets your nutritional needs.This is not something to be casual with.

2850224,0,t3_2spus3,The good news is that its easy to lose weight as a vegetarian if you pay attention to what you eat. Its also easy to get adequate nutrition and keep prediabetes from turning into anything more severe. This post is long I know but hopefully itll help get you some ideas. Do you eat eggs or fish? If so theyre great ways to supplement protein. Do you do dairy? Greek yogurt cottage cheese etc. If you get unsweetened greek yogurt you can control what you put into it  I always add a little sugar just enough to take the edge off the tart flavor. I add berries too. Its tasty. Just pay attention to how much sugar youre adding. I only do a teaspoon or so maybe a teaspoon and a half. Cottage cheese and fruit are delicious together and cottage cheese is also good savory. Otherwise make sure youre adding beans lentils etc. to your diet to help with protein. Im not vegetarian but I try to eat more vegetarian than not. I eat mostly chicken seafood and eggs for protein with a lot of supplementing cottage cheese and greek yogurt and beans. I also try to have at least three colors of veggie on every plate and make sure their portions are bigger than my meat. This has the added bonus of keeping calories low since many veggies are not calorically dense and eating large portions will help fill you up. Sometimes I like to make elaborate dishes with lots of prep and work in the kitchen but most of the time I like to eat things with minimal processing because Im more likely to take thirty minutes to cook after a long day than I am to spend two hours babying something on the stove as much as I enjoy it I dont always have the energy for it. So I do things like roasted veggies toss in oil  choose nut or seed oils here  lightly saltpepper spread across a cookie sheet lined in foil put in oven until cooked to your desired level of doneness braised veggies sauted veggies and so on. This kind of thing only takes fifteen minutes to a half an hour to prepare and can be really tasty. Serve with a small portion of rice quinoa couscous etc. Add in some beans a poached egg or seared tofu and youll be set. Expand the veggies you eat to try new things. Beets and radishes are both fantastic when cooked to any of the above methods. Leeks are delicious when baked. Kale or spinach can be roasted till the edges are crispy and they taste great. Yellow squash or zucchini are tasty and easy to saut or braise. Tomatoes can be roasted and served as a side. Parsnips are one of my favorite things to roast  in fact Ive thrown parsnips carrots broccoli and cauliflower in the oven together twice in the past week. Eat like that for every meal and youll feel better because your body will be getting a lot of nutrients and youll lose weight because veggies are not laden with calories. As long as you carefully measure the amount of oil you use to cook them with youll be fine. You dont need them drenched just lightly coated. ,loseit,cns2j21,1,t5_2rz8w

You cant fix a broken diet with exercise you can and should lose weight just from food alone.   Only after you have a working diet can you add exercise as an enhancement.  The first step toward control is awareness.  Most of use use an app called MyFitnessPal both app and website. It helps you keep track  and thats the first step.  Just sign up and keep track for a few days.  Dont change anything.  After a few days look back and see what things are your biggest issues and just change those things in the future.  Take baby steps toward a better lifestyle dont change everything at once.  Just change slowly  a battleship doesnt UTurn on a dime but slowly just a few degrees at a time.   Still it doesnt take too long even with all those slow changes.  So  Read the FAQ  Forget about exercise for now  Get on MyFitnessPal   Change a little at a time  review and change a few things every few days,loseit,cnvjzek,1,t5_2rz8w

Experiment tweaking them some people feel fuller on protien others not so much. And dont fool yourself into thinking that eating below your TDEE is healthy and that the hunger will ever fully subside if youre eating less than what your body requires to function efficiently. I just worry a bit when I see people saying its okay to be hungry it doesnt mean you NEED TO eat. Hunger does mean youre lacking something and if its carrying on even after the beginning of your diet change its not just your body getting used to it anymore.Im not saying anyone in this thread is wrong Im just providing a little information because I worry about newer people getting the wrong idea about it. It is okay to be hungry if youre just starting out and you dont know how to tell between hunger and cravings and youre relearning how to have willpower and your stomach is used to being stretched to its limit instead of sticking to serving sizes. But it shouldnt be a permanent state of living you shouldnt live with letting yourself be hungry all the time.

Now is the best time to deal with it and I think it is great that you thought to bring it up and ask about it here.I dont personally have experience with binging so I apologize if I should just be keeping my mouth shut. My experience is more with the starving part. Anyway about how much are you eating not counting binges? Perhaps a good thing to do would be to up your daily calories a decent chunk weight loss would be slowed but not stopped and maybe that would not let you get to the physical triggering of a binge? Then perhaps it would be easier to tackle the psychology of the binging? What personally worked for me regarding the obsession over food was to plan my entire days menu the evening before. Everything from when I wake up to when I go to bed. That way for the entire day I dont have to obsess about anything. I already know what and how much I am eating and when I plan I make sure it is healthy food and healthy amounts. I really dont have to concern myself with food for the whole day. In the hour that I plan out my next day which is actually really easy to do because I outline my whole week when I go grocery shopping I still get control it just doesnt have the opportunity to be something I think about all day every day.,loseit,coi10wf,1,t5_2rz8w

To me the best way to handle someones good intentions is to be inclusive of them. Its a weekly thing so while one person gets to be head chef the other helps prepare. Or if its made beforehand talking about recipes and how to spice it up lower the calories ect. I think being inclusive and honest would really help since the two of you have a great relationship. ,loseit,coi7ne3,4,t5_2rz8w

Eating quality foods high in protein and lower in carbs keeps you from being hungry. Sugars make you hungry.

I repeat every day adding in a small variation here and there when I go to the grocery store that helps me learn more about food and the value it has. That all being said youre actually at a great loss rate. The main thing you want to do is make sure you dont burn out by trying too much at once.

That same week I actually cheated again.IN both cases I cheated on  meal in that day not the whole day but both put me significantly over my calories.My Advice Dont schedule cheat days but allow yourself to cheat when you feel your willpower slippingScience has a lot of evidence to show that willpower is a muscle and it fatigues. Dont feel guilty about cheating. But dont hurt your body by scheduling a day to cheat every week. This is especially true if youre slipping badly as you said you seem to be. Also make sure youre using My Fitness Pal or some other calorie tracker every day even on days when you have to cheat. It reminds you how often you do it and you can work out the rest of the week to make up for a cheat day as I did. ,loseit,cou3m7x,1,t5_2rz8w

So your  number was in pretty good shape.So now that we know that we need to figure out whats going on. There are normally several possibilities. You are counting wrong.This is the most likely and the most common. Get a food scale. A lot of people will think they ate oz of chicken when they actually ate oz. You need to log exactly what youre eating including all sauces oils cooking oils and beverages.. Exercise is temporarily bloating your weightIf you just started a new exercise program your body will retain water for the first  weeks sometimes resulting in weight gain. You have to push through this first  weeks to see results.. WeighIn TimingPeoples weights can swing  pounds over the course of a day. Make sure you are weighing yourself in a controlled way same scale early morning after you pee and before you eat naked. Always do it the same.

I really like Teras Whey Grassfed Organic Blueberry.  Four ingredients.  That plus blueberries  awesome.  Now with Teras you need two scoops not one.  Ive also tried Shakeology Chocolate and Vanilla.  Shakeology is so expensive youll freak out when you see the cost.  You can find it cheaper though.  Id suggest just the trial pack of four flavors to see if you even like it.  Also its roughly  proteincarbs.  So the chocolate with half a frozen banana and ice made a chocolate shake so thick it was like soft serve ice cream.  I had to eat it with a spoon and it was amazing.  So I tried vanilla with frozen dark cherries.  It was also very very good.  Its roughly  a serving though which I can justify by not spending  or more at Wendys or Einsteins or whatever breakfast place.

It crossed my mind once or twice but fortunately Im too aware of the devastating consequences of eating disorders. So its good thats out of the question.. uUnaBarbaAzul is right. You are bullshitting yourself. If you had money to buy the pills you had money to join the gym. Furthermore all us junkfood addicts know we spent a ridiculous amount of money on junk food. Money we could have used to get a lot of healthy yummy food or to invest on our health. And we lied to ourselves many times. We told ourselves we couldnt afford these things while picking up the phone to order our next unhealthy meal. This doesnt mean you HAVE to join a gym. If you dont like it if you dont feel comfortable like many of us you can exercise at home. There are a lot of cheaper online exercise programs and basic equipment you can get. Theres no need for anything fancy.. Unhealthy food or food is not an addiction for everyone. For me it is so I treat it as such. Just like an alcoholic doesnt allow himherself one drink I dont allow myself one piece of junk food. A nugget will turn into  a hamburger today will turn into a hamburger tomorrow too etc. I cut it off completely. I know many deem this as extreme. Well I think some of us need extreme measures. I dont think a life without junk food is impossible. I dont think everyone should live without it but maybe some of us should. . This is not about motivation its about commitment and discipline. Discipline will help you on days that for whatever reason and life has plenty your motivation is low or gone especially if youve had depression and are an emotional eater. So you just put your head up and tell yourself that youll do this whatever it takes because you can because you have control of your life because youre strong.

3353502,0,t3_2yl0a4,I didnt even know they sold bowflexes anymore.  To me it was something that was advertised in the s when Baywatch and American Gladiators was on tv on a Sunday afternoon. At the end fo the day exercise is good and a good diet is necessary.  To the extent that the bowflex recommended diet results in you eating the appropriate amount of calories for your weight loss goals and you feel like it is something you can stick to it is probably good... but there are also many other great tools out there including MFP generally calorie counting to achieve a set of your TDEE etc.  Go for what you think will work for you.Exercise wise if you arent doing much at the moment a bowflex will certainly help you build strength though there may be better ways.   One of the criticisms Ive always heard about bowflex type equipment where bands or compacting bows are used to provide resistance is that the amount of resistance you are working with tends to change over the course of your range of motion an already stretched rubber band is harder to stretch further than a limp one.  Some people think this can lead to a.  developing a kind of strenght that isnt particularly useful in the real world and b.  potentially making you prone to injury Im not sure how but I had read it and Im sure a google search of bowflex criticisms can help out in this regard.

Im in the middle of pharmacy school and with the stress of classes within it I ended up gaining ish extra pounds last fall as well as developing GERD. My stress level was through the roof and I still havent really recovered from it. One of the biggest issues I have is that I get bored with eating the same foods all the time and I live by myself. I used to really enjoy cooking when it was for more than just me but that doesnt happen anymore so cooking feels like a chore I cant remember the last time I cut up a chicken breast and had that with some veggies. I guess my motivation has been completely zapped. I do love going to the gym however school gets in the way of that and I end up pushing it off until when Im not stressed about failing an exam.My weight has fluctuated quite a bit in the past two years I was down to lbs at one point in  but things happened and here I am today wanting to get at least back to that point and preferably down to lbs and stay that way. I think I have unrealistic views of the kind of time frame it takes to lose that much weight or what strategies I should focus on. If anyone has any advice I would LOVE to hear it.

3402571,0,t3_2z5fsp,Heres the thing OP. Given the amount you mention drinking in your comments cutting back wouldnt hurt. But if youre looking to drop  pounds you  probably wont get there by cutting soda alone. Check out the FAQ in the sidebar and use the tools linked there to calculate how many calories you should be consuming to lose weight. Now once youve figured out how many calories you should be eating theres some experimenting to do. Because theres two schools of thought when it comes to changing your diet          The Moderation MethodEat whatever you want as long as it stays within caloric budget. Pro You get to eat things like soda chips and pizza just less of it. Con Calories spent on junk food arent usually as filling and this causes some to overeat later in the day.The Total Avoidance MethodCut out things like fullsugar soda and junk food entirely and opt for healthier options. Pro Overall its more nutritious and generally more filling. Con Some find it frustrating to stick with longterm.I fall within the first cateogry. I drink soda eat pizza etc... just a lot less of it. Some people do better with a mix of both. Youve just gotta find the method that works best for you. Ultimately the best diet is the one youre able to stick with. ,loseit,cpg4a3z,7,t5_2rz8w

A quick story I got a minor sprain playing basketball at  but we were going to districts and I refused to stay off of it then two weeks later I went off my horse and snapped my tendon possibly because it was so swollen there was no give. Physical therapy barely touched it and  years and multiple re injuries due to weakness ended in an ankle with zero ligamenttendon support I tore everything bit by bit as it got weaker and rolled more frequently that literally wobbled with every step. I ended up needing surgery and have permanently lost about  of my range of motion and getting that much back wasnt easy and requires nightly stretching still  years after surgery and I still deal with regular stiffness and sometimes pain.

3429396,0,t3_2zgh37,Similar struggles here. Emotional eater have lost weight before. Depressionschool stress made it worse.    I was stuck in a funk for most of the beginning of this year just having gotten past it in the last month or so. I spent a lot of time doing the same thing you are but after keeping trying again and again it started to stick.    Couple of things that helped me    setting reasonable goals. These werent just diet related either. Things like sit at my desk for a week instead of laying on my bed make myself spend some time doing a hobby clean my room go to the gym once a week get  hours of sleep for a week straight eat more than  servings of veggies a day etc. Figure out some other things that you can succeed at that will help you feel accomplished and also just make you feel better. Make up some rewards too.    Investing in lowcal and nocal treats. So I know that theyre probably not the best for you but sometimes you just really want something sweetto eat a bunch so I figured if I was going to binge on something it might as well be something that would be harder for me to go over my calorie limits with.    Track all the food even the stuff that I binge. Its easy to be in denial about what youre doing to yourself but being honest and aware about it helps you be motivated to get past it    Exercise. Just something simple like a half hour walk. Or maybe something harder like taking up jogging. It lets you eat more and does good things for your mental state. Plus if you set fitness goals thats another place to feel accomplished.    Eat lots of small snacks instead of set meals. Especially when Im going to be doing the sort of stuff that makes me want to mindlessly snack its helpful to just track a bunch of stuff in the morning and portion it out so I dont have to think about it. Over time youll figure out best bang for your buck caloriewise too.    Friending people on MyFitnessPal. Its helpful to have a community no matter what kind. Find somewhere to get involved. you can friend me under this username on MFP    .    In the end the most important thing you can do is just keep picking yourself up everytime you fall down. If you had started one day later on your journey would that matter? No. So losing one day isnt the end of the world. It takes time to get back in your grove but if you keep at it youll get there. I know you can do it ,loseit,cpj6dmx,2,t5_2rz8w

It was gross BO soup weather humid as fuck and I was wearing a pretty extreme waist cincher I couldnt breath  very well and I was overheated and the trapped sweat smelled rancid. On top of that my thighs were scraping through my stockings and opening up scabs from yesterday and bleeding terribly. I remember stuffing toilet paper over the wounds when I got to work so they wouldnt rub together. Tight shorts helped but I wore through them faster than I could afford a replacement. I started day dreaming about walking into traffic. Like how great it would be if it looked like an accident and my parentsSO wouldnt have to know I killed myself.

I dont stick to a strict diet of certain foods but just making healthier choices.  Some days ice cream is just a really nice treat so Ill do the suggested serving size or smaller and make sure I log it.  At the end of the day I dont have regrets. For me personally weighing in every day led to an unhealthy obsession with the numbers.  Ive tried to limit to once a week and concentrate more on how Im feeling and how my clothes are feeling.  Dont get discouraged if things fluctuate during the blessed time of the month...its going to happen! Set small goals and praise the hell out of them!

3494246,0,t1_cpqdf5b,Honestly its all about calories. There are no bad foods. I still eat junk food I eat more fast food now than I did before I started losing weight its easier to find them on my fitness pal haha. I still eat a huge dinner I just eat lighter at breakfast and lunch. I still eat pasta for lunch I just am not eating two servings and then also eating a huge dinner. I still allow myself to binge eat a bag of chips or whatever when I want  usually on the weekends when Ive slept in and only eaten one meal instead of breakfast and lunch and have lots of calories left. I still eat a whole small pizza same thing about weekends. Sometimes I only eat half a pizza. My point is you can easily lose weight and it doesnt involve giving everything up. You just have to start counting calories and changing the amounts of things you eat. Also when you start bigger you have a higher TDEE. Youll be surprised at how much you can still eat while at a deficit. And your eating habits will totally change youll start to want to fill in your meals with vegetables so you can eat A LOT but not eat a lot of calories. My favourite change has been shredded green cabbage in stirfrys so I can eat a massive bowl of food but with less noodles or rice. Start with the free app mentioned in the OP  my fitness pal.

3563908,0,t3_3141k5,So I was a thin kid until puberty. Then BAM I was always probably  pounds over weight. Then during summer between junior and senior year of high school I decided I was done always being a little fat. So I started eating smaller portions walking  miles a day and just making smarter choices. But that was when it was easy no calorie counting or anything. I lost  lbs and got down to .So I maintained for about  years without even trying. Then I met my college boyfriend. He exclusively ate out. Exclusively. So yeah over the next  years of our relationship I gained  pounds. I started to lose that weight lost  pounds... Then he cheated on me. It destroyed me. I had no appetite and lost  pounds in  weeks this with forcing myself to eat. I got really depressed and losing weight that fast scared me. So I made myself eat really caloriehigh stuff to try and counteract it. And then I just kept eating that stuff to be happy. Got back up to my original highest weight.Now Im down  pounds from that. The first time I lost weight I gained back because I didnt keep weighing myself. I didnt keep things in check. The second time I lost and gained I was depressed and Im not sure I could have done anything to have avoided gaining.But now? Im in a great place. Im losing very consistently. I know what its like to be  and I know I want to be there again Im actually aiming for  so my snug size  will be a comfortable size . I know I can do it. And I know that the key to keeping the weight off is to never stop weighing myself personally.I might only weigh myself once a month at that point but I have a solid plan. This time if I start gaining Ill nip it in the bud before it goes over  lbs. This time I actually know what my TDEE will be and will have an actual calorie goal to aim for. The reason I will never gain again is because I now know what it actually means to maintain your weight. Its not just staying the same weight somehow its maintenance. Its a series of steps to ensure weight gain doesnt happen in excess again. ,loseit,cpyifvl,1,t5_2rz8w

3624263,0,t3_31v6a2,Hey I can completely relate to this. My stats are as follows so you have some idea  F   SW CW.When I started I could only walk . of a mile before I had to sit down and rest. I know this as it is exactly . miles to my old bus stop and by the time I got there my back would be aching and I needed desperately to sit down. I would wait for   buses to pass until there was one with a seat so I wouldnt have to stand for the ten minutes to get to my destination. It was bad. I started slowly losing about lbs before I brought exercise into the equation. Now I walk at the minimum . miles a day but recently Ive been doing about  miles. I had to build up to that of course but you can also build! Your  minutes each way is a fantastic start! If you find it boring put in some incentive. If I walk home I save .. Thats  a week. In a year thats about  enough for an amazing holiday. Sometimes I need a bit more so I download podcasts that I can only listen to when I am walking. Currently hooked on Serial. Give it a listen its free. But only when youre walking!Im also a big comfort eater and its because of emotional repression that I do it. Its easier not to feel just distract myself by mindlessly eating everything in sight. This has been the hardest thing to break and I dont think Ill ever be free of it entirely. But I got some help talked to someone and now I have a better handle on it because I know why I do it. Being mindful of your behaviour is what allows you to examine it critically and step back from the emotional blowout. My biggest tip is dont look at the lbs youd like to lose. Look at the first . When youve done that go for the next . Soon youll be  months in and  lbs lighter and youll look back and be amazed at how far youve come. In  days Ill be at this a year and Ive lost lbs but Im still not thinking about the end goal. At the moment I have lbs to  and I am so psyched to get there. That is my real attainable goal at the moment rather than a weight I can still only dream about. Lastly remember diet is always more important than exercise so try tracking for a while to give you an idea about the quantities of what youre eating. Youd be so surprised at the amount of calories things like oil butter and cheese have. Im not a big fan of tracking myself but it was definitely the wakeup call I needed when I was convincing myself I was eating healthily but still not losing weight.Best of luck to you! You will be fine. You are  capable and we all believe in you so prove us right!,loseit,cq5e5il,1,t5_2rz8w

Lap band surgery may sound like a great idea now but keep in mind that MANY patients who have undergone the surgery end up gaining back the weight because their mentality is now that Im skinny I can eat whatever I want.  Thats not how it works  you need to be strict even after the surgery.  Now if you think thats worth it to you or not and whether you think you can adhere to a strict diet is up to you.  If I were you I would rather not have the surgery and instead go on a lowcarb diet.  Cut out all sugarssugar alternatives from your diet and drink a LOT of water.

I have been steadily losing weight since December and I rarely dont get to eat exactly what I want. I also dont have a great deal to lose but it doesnt mean its coming off any easier. It is coming off though. Also have you thought about other ways to motivatemeasure your progress? The scale can be a jerk since it weighs absolutely everything not just body fat. Measurements can be a nice little tool to have on hand for the days that you think you should be seeing some payoff for your hardwork but the scale isnt going anywhere. Just a thought. And another possible obvious one but it doesnt actually occur to everyone  are you counting calories and tracking everything you eat? Its so so easy to underestimate food intake.

Well if you cut your calorie goal to  that would give you an extra  calories you could use as needed throughout the week without feeling too much guilt.If you are the sort of person who tends to fall off the wagon instead of using that calorie allowance to make room for special exceptions you could use it as a safety net for your failures.

One little thing that helped me was finding something to do with my hands that keeps me from eating because i dont want to have messy hands while performing that activity. At first I thought playing video games to distract myself would work but controllers are easily cleaned so that didnt stop me. Drawing during cravings helped because I dont want nasty food stains on my sketches but I also took up crochet and that really helped. I already get enough of my hair and my cats hair tangled into my projects that I dont want to contaminate them further. XDNow I dont have a problem with boredom eating anymore.

I love going to the gym now the last time I stopped was because I wasnt enjoying myself so I stopped prioritising it and didnt even try to exert energy to go. Find something you like so that youre not working to find an excuse but working to find time. As far as food find a way to make healthy food easier. Prep meals on the weekends or buy healthier options in the freezer section. I dont have motivation. I have dedication. The difference is me going to the gym even when Id rather sleep more. Im not motivated to get up before  am and run and lift heavy stuff. Im dedicated so that by the time I get to the run and heavy stuff I am motivated. I love lifting and as I get more into it I find other things more enjoyable that wouldve kept me from working out again before.So you have to dedicate a part of yourself to your body fueling it and working it.

If it had I think you would have received a very different response. I read that post earlier and while I didnt comment it sounded more like a fat acceptance post than the post of someone who is still trying to get to a healthy weight. Reddit is a very supportive place with lots of knowledge and information but we also have tough love. We wont bullshit you or give you a participation trophy. I didnt think the responses in that post were very harsh at all. They were honest. Had you mentioned you were still working to lose weight they would also have been very different. This sub and progress pics are both full of people literally working their asses off every day to get healthy. So when someone makes a post thats full of excuses or seems to be promoting the fat is healthy mindset which is how yours came across IMO many of us call it like we see it. Edit I also think its worth noting that there were two comments telling you that you are still obese at your weight neither of them cruel. Others were supportive of your progress.

3928374,0,t3_35ekke,I have type  diabetes and I have successfully lost weight for about  months now. My advice to your mom would be to cook real foods. What I mean is that if it comes in a box its probably not good for her. There is added sugar everywhere. IMHO a  calorie diet is way to restrictive its very hard to maintain for new losers which is why most fail.  Your mom does not need to go on a diet she needs a lifestyle change. Dont even think of it as a diet just think of it as eating differently. Carbs are sugar to your body there is no difference between white bread or any other bread as far as diabetes is concerned. Pasta potatoes rice bread...all generally bad in large quantities but fine if you just eat a little. So these are some things that worked for me I dont drink any sugar. In fact I take in no calories from anything I drink.  You can cut back on carbs in simple ways. For example if you want a sandwich just cut one slice of bread in half and use it for both sides. If you want something sweet to eat eat some fruit. Its still sugar but you also get fiber at the same time which helps your body regulate your blood sugar levels.  You can pretty much eat all the vegetables you can stand. Ive actually turned pretty much vegetarian other than eggs and fish. Fat me was a meat and potatoespasta guy. When you eat meat eat smaller portions of prime cuts and enjoy it. Give your self a big helping of veggies to go with it.  I hate the gym with a passion. I get my exercise in ways I enjoy its not even exercise to me just normal activity. Youre mom can do the same thing. For example if she likes flowers maybe she could start a small garden. Any exercise is good it burns calories and it also lowers your blood sugar. Forget about vigorous exercise for now and just set modest goals. Something as simple as walking around the block is all you need to do to get started.  Forget about losing  pounds. I started with something like I want to lose  pounds by the fourth of July it was an achievable goal and I felt encouraged that I did it.  By all means do something like My Fitness Pal. If nothing else it helps you recognize what your eating and when so you can make adjustments as needed. It probably the best thing for your mom so she can figure out where she is going wrong in her current eating habits. Dont deprive yourself! I see this all the time on the sub and it makes me a little sad. If you really want a piece of cheese cake or some chocolate go ahead and have a little. After awhile though I found I really dont crave the stuff that I once did. I know it sounds crazy but I swear its true once you get used to eating real foods youll wonder why you ever ate the stuff you used to and you wont even crave it. Good luck to your mom and thank YOU for helping her!,loseit,cr42j4u,6,t5_2rz8w

Its a mark of my past something to remind me of what I once was and easily could go back to being. If I do someday decide to go through with having it removed Ill cross that bridge but for now it is something I think of as a nonoption.What I wonder is this your excess skin is causing you to feel dissatisfied with your accomplishments to make you feel it wasnt worth it rather than making you feel that you have a healthy badge of honour. Are you sure you arent seeing it as something you deserve to be stuck with because of your past a badge of selfloathing that you feel is appropriate for you? Because what youre essentially saying here is I hate my loose skin but I want to hold onto it. I dont think youre going to forget any time soon what youve been through and what youve fought for and surgery leaves scars if you want a physical reminder  even tattoos would do that if you wanted something visually striking. I have no desire to pressure you into surgery but this comment was just so powerfully at odds with your post because you say you dont want to remove the loose skin unless it causes physical health problems but from what youre saying right now it appears to be contributing to mental health problems which in turn are causing you to physically selfharm by eating food you dont want.

3962187,0,t3_35t26y,Hey! Hey Hey Hey! I am here to tell you something... you can do this. I KNOW you can because I AM doing it. I know you see people on here that have lost lbs or  or  and its all the same. It takes a choice. It takes deciding whether or not youre done with being overweight. I spent years dieting and have wildly vacillated between  which is where I finally ended up last year.    It takes a decision. A choice that you need to make from a very honest place which is I want to be healthy.    For me it was I am so profoundly unhappy I have never NOT been overweight. I am sick tired and discovering that over time my prospects were not looking good. And it took that kind of brutal honesty of what my life would look like if I kept doing exactly what I was doing. My behavior today had consequences tomorrow. There was a plotline of my life and it SUCKED. It was fucking miserable even if I managed to find joy in the little bits i.e. Cake or other crap that made me feel better but in the long run my life story was going to be short terrible and fucking sad.    And thats what I did. I DECIDED it was time to change. I didnt know how because I had so much baggage about diets and theres a thousand different reasons I had in my head that if I just stopped paying attention or ate what tasted good Id figure it out someday. But thats what I learned. I was lying. I was lying to myself every day saying that I couldnt do it... and that Id be okay if I could get through the moment and using food as a reward system instead of it being what it was designed to be which is fuel for life.    Calorie countingdietingexercise are all skills you can learn once youve made the choice but it has to be a real honest choice to start. To say Hey! I want to get healthy whatever that means.    Now dont get me wrong Ive only lost  lbs this year but it took a lot of trial and error and getting over some of my own demons but its always been in the same trajectory. Even if it takes me ten years to lose the weight so I can fit into a standard coach seat on an airline or it takes me five years of doing whatever I figure out works for my body... I will do it because the point isnt the number on the scale its about deciding what kind of life you want.    I know you can do this. I know I can too... because its a process if you start out high enough. Its a whole sea change but I pay attention to the people who have lost a great deal of weight because their journeys happen over years with such incredible results. I know Im going to be one of those people because there is no giving up option for me. Its this or death for me. And Im going to go out swinging whenever that happens to be. ,loseit,cr7x8al,1,t5_2rz8w
3963351,0,t3_35udbp,Peanuts and raisins has been a good one for me but you have to measure it out because the calories add up quickly. Eat it slowly and enjoy it. Another saving grace for me as a sugar hog is fat free fudge pops. Kroger has  cal bars and they satiate the sweet urges that I get late at night. I normally have  of them in my calorie budget from the start of the day so theyre already accounted for when Im craving something sweet later on. Freezing bananas and tossing one in the food processor is a great substitute for ice cream. If youve never tried it youll be shocked at how wonderful it is. Greek yogurt cottage cheese string cheese are all good snacks. I like to focus on protein and fats and not waste calories on carb dense stuff. Im not on keto or anything but fats and proteins keep me full for longer. ,loseit,cr82099,1,t5_2rz8w

There is so much more to a human being than their physical appearance. There are plenty of women who have been in relationships where all they were valued for was the way they look its not a satisfying relationship jsyk. Everything you are is so important and youre truly lucky to have someone who sees those things and loves that about you.Sometimes we dont get what we want we get what we need.

3992908,0,t1_crbepwc,gt I read an article else where FAQ perhaps? that dismissed the whole survival mode notionYou did read it.  There is a popular misinterpretation of Starvation Mode which says that if you eat too little youll stop losing weight because your body tries to hang on to the weight it has in order to survive.  Like most myths there is some truth to it.  The truth is in the article that is linked above  there is a metabolic adaptation of a few hundred calories.  Meaning if the math suggests youd be losing  lbs. a week because you have a  deficit off off your  TDEE youre eating  calories a day you may only lose  pounds a week because of the metabolic adaptation mentioned in the article.  Eating a very low calorie diet... The Starvation Mode myth is that you stop losing weight if you ever eat less than  calories. The reality is that you will tend lose weight somewhat slower than the math suggests you should proportionate to the size and duration of the deficit.,loseit,crbfbb5,2,t5_2rz8w

Im also going to say Im dehydrated from my new prescription allergy medicine and it gives me a headache if I dont drink enough water... my hubs suggested that last night. My dad has a history of needing sinus issues and my mother had to nurse him through surgery so if I make it an earnosethroat kind of thing its more likely theyll click into that mode like Oh I know all about that... Which means well talk about their sinus issues instead of my alcohol consumption for the next hour!

4044616,0,t1_crghi49,Same for me the more data i have the better i feel about it. It might be a little bit disturbing at first when you see no change or even an increased weight on the next day but over time you realize that it is just fluctuation due to water weight or other minor factors. The most important thing is the overall trend not any changes on a weekly basis.Also you really should learn to ignore the weekly weight graph on MFP as this one is just too misleading in my opinion. Looking at my current weekly graph it seems like i am on a plateau or even gaining weight which i know is basically impossible on the deficit im on. I had those graphs a lot of times already so i know that they dont mean anything but i can imagine that some people might get discouraged when they see something like that.Watching the Monthly Trend already gives a way better image of your overall progress and by time you will learn to handle daily weight swings better and look forward on tomorrow instead of worrying about the pound you mysteriously seem to have gained yesterday.,loseit,crhbese,2,t5_2rz8w

4078425,0,t3_37b096,If nothing else you can write.  Overall it was very good and really conveyed your history and where your currently at.  Maybe consider blogging.  As for your weight loss you should focus on how many calories you are consuming instead of the types of food you are eating.  Things like keto work in part because they help people with cravings and not eating a lot of caloriedense low nutrient foods. You can still lose eating other foods you just need to eat less. This actually helps with low budgets because if you limit how much you eat the food goes a lot farther. A box of mac and cheese is nearly a days worth of calories but has poor nutrient makeup making it difficult to only eat that for the day.  Eating healthy and exercising can be goals for another day once you have gotten control of your calorie intake. ,loseit,crl5zml,12,t5_2rz8w
4078987,0,t3_37b096,Hello! I started at  so I can understand where youre coming from. Im totally here if you ever need to talk or vent which I think a lot of this post is. However Im going to say something and I want you to think about it okay? Its one of my favourite quotesCircumstances are seldom right. You never have the capacities the  strength the wisdom the virtue you ought to have. You must always do with less than you need in a situation vastly different from what you would have chosen.  Charlton Ogburn Jr.From your post you have put a lot of reasons why you got to the weight you did and why you cant lose weight now. You blame your parents your lack of money your boyfriend your location no weightloss buddy your neighbours. Its always someone elses fault. And thats okay when I was that weight I did the same thing. I wanted to change but I had resigned myself to being this way forever. What youre doing is putting up roadblocks from the start so that when you do try and fail you can say Well there was no point since all this is in the way. And that is a really selfsabotaging way to start a new lifestyle.Theres always going to be something always going to be an excuse. Lets focus on what you can change instead. Your boyfriend wants takeout? Let him get it. Cook your own meal and let him go to town. Your weak point is candy and icecream? Dont keep it in the house. At the moment its all about diet so exercise isnt incredibly important at the minute. If you cant get by on  meals a day break it up into  smaller meals. Youre going to Aldi for food and thats great. reatcheapandhealthy is a great subreddit for people like us on a budget. If you have no weightloss buddy find a support group. Theres weight watchers slimming world TOPS OA even this page.Make a plan. Follow through with that plan. Thats all you need to lose the weight.

4095232,0,t3_37i89a,On one hand I disagree with intuitive eating as a comprehensive approach to weight management.  I think that calorie counting is a more accurate approach for the large majority of people ...and the majority of large people? who dont have a compelling reason not to count.  You have a compelling reason not to count namely your anxiety so its not like Im going to tell you to count calories.  You cant solve one problem by introducing or worsening another.  That doesnt count.  On the other hand I think theres an important insight to be gained from intuitive approaches to things like weight loss and that is to ask is this really what I think it is?  Specifically that means to ask yourself if youre really actually hungry in a physical sense.  Have you eaten enough for the meal to be satisfied?  Are you really hungry or do you just want to eat to feel something different than what you feel because youre bored angry or stressed?I think getting in touch with your actual thoughts and feelings is an important part of losing weight but like I said in the absence of a compelling reason to do something different I wouldnt do intuitive eating or advise others to.  I think theres a better method out there.  But given your situation and my own experience with mental health issues you do you.,loseit,crn2yiv,2,t5_2rz8w

4107447,0,t3_37o8y1,The Paleo diet and the Primal diet are both good for creating habits of eating nutrient dense healthy foods. Both have some odd restrictions Paleo restricts dairy and pickled foods and Primal restricts legumes which I seriously doubt a caveman would turn down. But the general idea is solid cut back on packaged highly processed frankenfoods that are messing with your triglycerides and your hormones and focus on the healthy foods our preagriculture ancestors would have likely had available.You can create new habits around healthy living. Supply yourself well with lots of healthy choices and keep track of how much of those foods you are eating using myfitnesspal so you know whether youre on track. Weigh yourself daily and keep track of the average it will swing up and down with variations in water carbs and sodium consumption. Dont expect instant results. Those weight loss reality TV shows abuse their guests and paint a very unrealistic picture of weight loss. You have to make some permanent changes in your relationship with food. It may take a year or more but you can do it. Theres no magic tricks though getting your insulin swings under control may help with cravings and getting hangry.Take some hope from the fact that weight loss boils down to just two things moving more or eating less. Every two weeks do a progress check with your average weight. If you dont see movement in the right direction then something needs to change you have to either move more or eat less. Always opt for moving more if possible.Oh one last thing. Get an account on Audible.com for the exercise. You and your husband can share an account and download audiobooks to listen to.

4112503,0,t3_37o8y1,The one thing I will say is that it gets easier. Just a few weeks in I already feel disgusted when I eat something crappy and I just avoid unhealthy food like the plague.The other day someone offered a cookie and I was like no thanks because I knew I only had  calories left for the day and I needed it for dinner. I was not about to spend most of it on pure sugar. It felt amazing and its a form of positive reinforcement.When I was in shape I remember craving and enjoying healthy food and how disgusted I was with most processed food. You easily get used to the sugar and the salt but once youre back on the wagon you start realizing just how awful they taste.These days when I crave sugar I just eat an apple or some string cheese and drink lots of water  the fiber is more filling and the cheese gives me satiety in small portions. And I find that the more water I drink the better I feel overall.Honestly the biggest thing that keeps me from eating crap is the realization that running for an hour at  mph burns  calories for me which is the same as eating a Big Mac or two donuts. Plus if I do not eat that donut and I run for half hour then I feel so much better than having eaten that donut and feeling guilty about it.As a direct result I find that I choose where I expend my calories towards more quality than quantity. I may only have one glass of wine but I thoroughly enjoy it! Good luck. As others have mentioned remember that this is a marathon and not a sprint. ,loseit,crp1u8o,3,t5_2rz8w

That means you can eat  calories and maintain your weight. A pound is about  calories so you can lose a pound a week by eating  calories fewer than your TDEE each day in your case .  is doable but more aggressive.Before you start with either of those numbers though take a week to just log everything you eat now. Look over that log after a week and find easy changes. You should be able to find areas you can easily cut back. After that spend a week eating a a  calorie deficit or even at maintenance if youre going way over each day. Get used to eating a little less. Make note of whats making you feel full and which meals arent satiating enough for the calories they have. After  feels doable try . If  starts to feel easy then you can try going down to .

4182166,0,t3_38q4uo,Seek help for your binge eating problem there is a significant chance that there is something causing you to use food for something food cannot be used for. Whether its to cure boredom stifle negative emotions whatever food is not an appropriate response to anything other than nutritional need and hunger. Okay now that we have that out of the way heres some suggestions. You dont need to eat healthy right now. You just dont. Itll come with time trust me but first you need to worry about portion size not completely overhauling your diet. How do you do that? I would recommend downloading the app MyFitnessPal if you dont have a smartphone they also have a website!. For a week just log accurately everything you put in your mouth. Everything. Ketchup oil you use for cooking that single hershey kiss. Everything. Dont worry about staying under the goal just log it.If you want bonus points and some more assuredness when you get to the weight loss get a food scale as well. Volume measurements are a poor way to measure anything except for liquids and sometimes fine powders. So you have that what did I mean about eating healthy will come then?Well heres the fun part. After logging doesnt seem like effort anymore start trying to stay under your calorie goals on MFP. I highly recommend to not jump right down to lose  lbsweek on MFP!!!! It very well might give you a calorie goal of  calories day which is very doable when you are in the swing of things but will be tricky to start out with. Try maybe  lbweek loss on the sedentary setting and see how you do. Eat the things you USUALLY eat but in portions that leave you under.Still with me? Good. Now you might realize or maybe not that youre awfully hungry with things you usually eat in portions that allow you to lose weight. If thats the case slowly replace things in your diet with lower calorie options. Many people will recommend replacing simple carbs with fats proteins and complex carbs with plenty of fiber for satiety and I would agree with them. Again you dont have to eat anything you dont like.  If after all of this you are still worried about being a picky eater do not despair! I grew up my entire life never eating fruits or vegetables. I thought I would HATE them forever but I dont. After a while of counting calories and realizing that a lot of the very sweet processed things I liked were not really worth their calorie count Be very careful here I am still to this day allowed to eat whatever I want. I choose not to. I stopped eating so much sweet bland food. Suddenly fruit almost seemed like dessert to me and vegetables had a more complex and pleasant taste. Trying things out with different cooking methods helped me find ways that I like certain vegetables and they add volume to my meals without being massive calorie sinks. If you want a trick that worked for me putting veggies in soup and cooking them until I got the flavor of them but not the texture heavily cooked vegetables pretty much lose their texture usually helped me as a baby step towards enjoying vegetables. Good luck!!,loseit,crwyxsj,2,t5_2rz8w

4186786,0,t1_crxhe86,gt Any suggestions on what sort of exercise i should do now?SHORT TERM Since this is missionweightloss  and weight loss being  about the food  Id say put your focus on eating and simply avoiding long hours of butttime.  Set a  minute timer any time you sit and then get up and do something  take out the trash wrestle with the dog make the bed walk to the post.  LONG TERM You do want to be strong and fit but you should consider that a separate but complementary effort.  So Ill advise you like this  imagine its  years from now.  Youve lost all your excess weight and successfully kept it off.  Youre active and feel very alive  your food is great your body is great  youre a man in motion living the life youve always wanted. Now think  what are you picturing when you picture that guy  the future you.  What is he actively doing?    Figure that out and pursue it.   If you have several ideas write them all down and rank them  chase the top ones. Again this is only related to weight loss.  Managing your weight will always be about managing your food exercise never replaces that.  So what you do here merely helps your weight loss your weight loss is not dependent upon it.,loseit,crxhu4t,4,t5_2rz8w

There are a lot of ketoers who just dont ever want to eat another way. Good for them. I tried it and it worked well but like you I knew it wasnt sustainable long term. I did learn a lot about how blood sugar works and how certain food mainly white processed carbs like white bread work on the body so my time doing lowcarb was worth it.

You have to say no to something in life.  You have to say no to your habits or you have to say no to living life on your own terms.

This is called TDEE and its specific for every person. Calculate yours then eat less than that and you will lose weight. Download myfitnesspal and be religious about logging every single morsel of food that enters your face. Start weighing your food because its actually really hard and inaccurate to eyeball and measuring cups arent always precise.So  isnt automatically the the number to stay under. Check out the side bar cause my explanation is probably confusing. But yes eat whatever you want.

The number on the scale at this point in your weight loss hardly matters.  What youre looking for is a body recomposition.  You need more muscle and less fat to get that look you want.  This will mean that the scale may go up a few pounds yes.  But pounds of muscle will leave you looking far better than pounds of fat.Here is another article I think may help you understand.

4330876,0,t3_3ajaim,Well you got lots of advice here about making sure youre tracking accurately and maybe dropping to  calories and see if that helps which is all good advice. I just have to be the one to ask this tho and I hope for your sake everyone else is really just right and following their advice solves everything have you had your thyroid checked? If I was absolutely sure I was tracking my intake thatd be the first thing Id look at. Also doctors often only check TSH but you should ask them to check T and T as well they might not want to until after they get the TSH back but try to talk them into doing it all at once. If your doctor is cool tho and its not hard to talk them into extra blood tests I would also ask for insulin levels cbc b and ferritin. For instance if you were hyperinsulinogenic you could have perfect blood sugars still and accurately be tracking your intake but still not be losing weight. ,loseit,csdthtr,2,t5_2rz8w

4338253,0,t1_cseg72c,Well first of all I would not recommend that you follow my example...I only ate  meals a day. Sometimes skipped one of them. I was hungry almost all the time and sometimes in a bad mood because of that.I think the most important part was setting some pretty strict rules about what I was allowed to eat. I quit everything that contains added sugar sweets desserts all bakery products bread cake and anything fried... i didnt even eat beans and the like. Only cereal I ate was oatmeal and oat bran always for breakfast with some flaxseeds sprinkled over.I ate lots of vegetables mostly broccoli carrots spinach onions and cellery. No dressing. It can be tasty if you find a nice combination of vegetables that you can enjoy. Also I LOVE broccoli.Meat was always either grilled or steamed... any kind of meat chicken pork beef etc. But never too much meat. Drank lots of water like a lot. Skim milk for lunch sometimes.My favorite dinner was salad Broccoli chopped onions and carrots with a couple of crushed pecan seeds and a little bit of parmesan with grilled chicken breast. ,loseit,csenfsj,1,t5_2rz8w

4348554,0,t3_3arp8f,I recommend you only count calories to begin with  dont bother with exercise yet. Even if you have the urge to exercise you can easily fall into one of two traps when starting out eating too much after exercise because you get hungry or eating more than recommended because Ill burn it off later.  I think most people here would say that the most important thing you can do is gain control over the amount youre eating. Any exercise after that is just a bonus. Even just by counting calories youll likely see the first lbs drop off in  weeks. Eat Food. Not a lot. Mostly Vegetables. is good advice but I find it a  near impossible transition to make immediately. So keep eating the things you like just less of them and make sure you have the calories budgeted for them. Transition to the healthier foods over time. Get the My Fitness Pal app on your phone and log everything in there.

Aside from some BS fat logic that occasionally found its way in to my mind its not that I dont understand what bad foods are.My real problem has been the deceptive story I told myself that I could eat bad foods and I would somehow control them.  I can tell you one story after another where I instead of  cookies I had a rowentire bag or hell pick anything delicious and theres a story like it.I finally came to the conclusion that I really cant manage my food intake around things are are highly engineered to be superfampking delicious.  I dont know why and for now I dont care but I just know its true.   Other people can get away with it I cant.  I try not to pay attention to them or envy them.So I accepted that unless I was going to exert a significant conscious effort to control food every single time I ate which I was unlikely to sustain in the long run I had start taking crap out of my diet build habits.  I literally look at some foods and say thats one I cant handle in any quantities.   So far thats leaving me with healthier choices around me that I can default to without going overboard.If I hear that little voice saying one cookiedonutbag o chips wont hurt I tend to reply aggressively even if it means imagining terrible outcomes.

If you use muscles that have been dormant for awhile you will find they hold onto water to repair themselves as they figure out just what in the hell it is you are doing to them. Similar results will occur if you have a high sodium intake day.Having other ways of measuring progress outside of that number on the scale will always be beneficial.  You see yourself in the mirror every single day so subtle changes will often go unseen. But when you see side by side shots more changes come to light.And Measurements well sometimes you lose inches but no weight.

Peanut butter in yogurt is yummy.Protein shakes and bars are worth considering as well as adding a tablespoon of protein powder to oatmeal or a smoothie in the morning.Because vegetarians get their iron from nonmeat sources they have to learn about how best to combine foods to get sufficient iron.Talk with your doctor and while youre there see if heshe might get you a referral to a registered dietitian.

4515402,0,t3_3cx7em,Tricylen lo already has a relatively low level of hormones. If you were previously on a high dose usually older generation pills and were taking them because you needed high estrogen in order to control your cycle then its possible you wouldnt need such a high dose of estrogen anymore after weight loss. I doubt this applies to you.    Loss of sex drive in kind of subjective and different for everyone and doesnt necessarily have to do directly with the amount of hormones in your birth control. Also keep in mind that there are various forms of synthetic estrogens and progestins used in the pill.    Another thing to consider is that the ratio of estrogen to progestin in different pills rather than just the dose can have effects. For an example Ive only ever been on lowdose combination pills but found that ones that are estrogendominant lower ratio of progestin make me feel slightly depressed. Im much happier on monophasic pills with slightly higher progestin estrogen is still low. Many women have to try several different formulations to find a birth control method that agrees with them.    Bottom line If youre experiencing loss of libido or issues with mood talk to your doctor about trying a different formulation. Otherwise I wouldnt worry about this based solely on someones comment.,loseit,cszt88n,3,t5_2rz8w

Youve tried half a dozen methods of weight loss sporadically only two of them likely to actually work counting calories. Weight loss is not linear. It takes a lot of time patience and dedication. You only did MFP for a week try it for  months and be strict with it. I guarantee you will lose weight.I am on hormonal birth control and mood stabilizers that are known to hinder weight loss and make you gain weight. The medication does NOT make you gain weight but it may make you hungry less likely to be able to fight impulsive behavior. The medication itself is a poor excuse for weight gain.,loseit,ct7byy6,11,t5_2rz8w

4589460,0,t1_ct8pn3c,My biochemistry background is limited but I do know that only  to  of the bodys total energy production comes from protein and the rest comes mostly from carbohydrates. The process of breaking down proteins compared to starches is relatively more complex difficult especially considering the product is the same Glucose. With carbs breakdown of the starches begins in the mouth but breakdown of proteins doesnt begin until food reaches the stomach. So I believe it is entirely possible that protein causes you to feel more full because it takes longer and requires more energy to digest. At the same time I imagine it would be extremely hard to prove that is the reason protein makes you feel fuller when there are many other factors at play Ex meat usually contains fat. Furthermore it would be hard to actually measure the energy difference between the processes and I dont think the difference would be large enough for it to reflect on a persons TDEE with the current methods we have. ,loseit,ct93j8a,3,t5_2rz8w

Your TDEE is affected by certain things like your age height weight activity level etc. Im very short  between  and   so my TDEE at sedentary is about  calories. That would mean to lose two pounds a week I would have to eat at  calories a day which is besides not medically appropriate really hard to do and not particularly healthy. Consequently I aim for  a day with a little exercise thrown in here and there. I still struggle to hit the appropriate totals for protein fiber etc. but Ive found that my body doesnt really need as much food overall as I thought it did. If I were you I would not eat at  immediately. Even after youve started to adjust your calorie totals for the day I would ease into it.

4630911,0,t3_3eefoo,Like funcords and cordiliashonor said he needs to truly make a decision to change things up. Diet gt exercise for weightloss of course. We all know that in rloseit but since I have no idea what your husband knows you would have to tell him thats how weightloss works. There is an enormous amount of misconception about that. If he is a reader likes to do his own research send him to the loseit FAQ and around the subreddit. My husband actually helped point me to loseit when I was going crazy trying to out run my fork. It the starting point for real loss for me. Now Ive become the expert of the house and I am helping him lose weight for the same reasons you listed for your husband. Doesnt eat those socalled healthy foods doesnt exercise worries about his health but he isnt active at all so thats one more strike against him actually. As a couple if you are going to help him and he wants to change you will have to decide how much effort you are willing to put into supporting your husband. Will you just point him in the right direction and show him how to do things himself or take an active role in providing him food to eat like cooking with him and planning exactly what and how to diet. Im crazy and choose to give my man a lot of support. I keep his food diary for him often I preportion snacks and meals but he does weigh things himself too we come up with recipes together but I am the final decision maker on if this is OK or not he knows what to eat at restaurants because I told him the list goes on. Im happy to do this. Its a lot of work but thats fine. Youll have to think what you are willing to put on the table as support. ,loseit,cteap1z,2,t5_2rz8w

4632298,0,t3_3efoam,I think the key here is that eventually they we as a society will have to establish the clear difference between body image and health when it comes to weight.I do think all bodies should be accepted even the bodies of those who have willingly decided to stay overweightobese. Why? Because nobody is going around telling people who smoke drink sleep  hours a night are sedentary when that doesnt affect their weight eat unhealthily  when that doesnt affect their weight do drugs are promiscuous or any other bad health habits that theyre ugly and they dont belong and they dont deserve love. The problem with people who criticize weight from the appearance point of view is that theyre not concerned about your health theyre not even pissed off at you for not taking care of your own health they do it because they believe you dont fit certain standard and they find that displeasing. Its a superficial stupid reason to tackle weight problems that in my opinion has caused more damage than good. Not only does it not reach overweightobese people very effectively but it has become a problem for healthy people too obsessed with fitting that standard even when theyre already at a healthy weight and lead a healthy life. Theyre not telling you be healthy theyre telling you be beautiful the way we have decided beautiful is. And that has been very damaging. The other problem is it targets a very wide range of population. Criticism of body image is not for obese people or very overweight people. It turns out that if youre a little overweight or even at a healthy weight but your BF is high or youre not toned or you dont have a tight gap thats how ridiculous its gotten youre supposed to feel bad about yourself. I understand why theyre trying to change all this mentality. Its so damaging. Maybe what we need too is stronger campaigns against obesity focused on the many physical mental and emotional benefits of leading a healthier life and losing weight. So far those campaigns have been pretty pretty weak.,loseit,ctegyat,7,t5_2rz8w

4657689,0,t3_3er1mw,my urges are stronger than my restraint is the  reason most people fail to control their eating. The biggest problem specific to your post that I see is that you are associating the reality of taking care of yourself healthy eating and exercise with auxiliary goals getting in shape for a trip getting girls.I urge you to consider carefully that the control of your desire to eat is vastly more impactful than the result of having a healthy weight and looking good for girls.Gandhi said that The control of the palate is a valuable aid for the control of the mind. This is an important truth. Our instinct to eat and the desire it evokes is powerfully encoded into us. Our ability to transcend our instincts and live according to knowledge is the most powerful thing that distinguishes human beings from the rest of the species. To learn to control your own mind is the most powerful thing you can do to live well. This affects EVERYTHING in your living not just eating and exercise. The habit of eating and exercising according to right knowledge in spite of our desires is an important practice with benefits that go way beyond the incidental benefits of being the correct weight or being physically attractive. Living by right knowledge and not by desire is a central discipline for living well and is an essential condition for being the best you that you can be. Restructuring your perspectives regarding goals should remove your eating and exercise habits from specific and temporary goals to a style of living that last the rest of your life. This should be a lifetime devoted to being your best in all ways. Once you lose weight and get in shape that specific goal is fulfilled. Once you get a girlfriend then that specific goal is fulfilled. What happens to your better eating and exercise habits then??? I suggest that these goals are not the most worthy. Exploring the full depth of the beauty and value of your life takes all the energy and time you can manage to gain. Taking the best care of yourself in a way that reflects living by right knowledge and not by whatever desire happens to be in your heart each moment is a powerful pathway to realizing that beauty and value.Consider that you should strive to be more attractive not because you managed to make yourself look physically good but because you have learned to control your mind and your living to become a better human being. Looking good will be a natural result among many other results of this practice. You want relationships with people who love you not because you have pretty hair or muscles but for the whole of your being. The better of a human being you become the better the quality of the people who will be attracted to you. Learning to be the master of your own mind will teach you how to speak that mind to others including girls. Eating right and exercise is not a tool just to get this or that desired result. It is an essential instrument for improving yourself.There are a few steps to implement this perspective. See eating and exercise as a lifelong commitment to giving yourself as much energy and longevity as possible. Recognize that it is an important practice to becoming the best human being you can be.. GAIN KNOWLEDGE Do not rely on the opinions of others. If you live in a society where  of the population is overweight then most people do not have a clue as to what a healthy weight is. Look up your height and weight on a BMI chart. Find out what healthy eating really is about. For example if you have a sweet tooth learn how to kill that damn thing a great exercise in prioritizing knowledge over desire! Shifting from eating junk to healthier food is not just a trick to lose weight it really is important to be healthy in the long term. Find out what your daily calorie needs are to maintain your weight and how many calories you need to restrict to in order to be healthy while you drop to your goal weight. Do not pretend you have the ability to magically know how many calories are in a serving you just put before you. If it is not labeled use a kitchen scale to measure. Eat by knowledge not by intuition! Before you eat anything ask yourself Is this knowledge or is this desire? If it is a desire that contradicts your knowledge learn to dismiss it with pleasure. If you cannot take more pleasure in the knowledge that helps you be your best than you take in fulfilling your desires to please your palate then your problems are deeper than being overweight.. Improve your focus by minimizing your need to focus Do not allow yourself to change your eating and exercise by relying on your ability to spontaneously create a new focus each and every time you eat or exercise. PLAN AHEAD!!!! Knowing in advance what kind and amount of food to eat requires much less focus ability than spontaneously managing your eating extemporaneously. Schedule your exercise so it does not compete for other focuses. For me exercising first thing in the morning one hour after breakfast gets it out of the way and allows me to focus on other things all day. For others evening can be best. Figure out how to schedule your exercise to minimize your need to spontaneously create the focus you need to get it done. Use an app to track your calories it requires much less focus than keeping it in your head. Use exercise as a meditation tool that helps you focus on other things. If you are always thinking about stuff exercise in a way that empties your mind to focus on the physical experience. Figure out how to make exercise something that refreshes and empowers the rest of your day. This is MUCH better than feeling like it is competing with your other focus priorities. Also if you have trouble focusing make sure you are creating written schedules to follow!!!Good Luck!,loseit,cthnqzv,2,t5_2rz8w

4671529,0,t3_2xozh5,Im finally posting here after a while of lurking. I lost a lot of weight about  years ago due to starting up running with the Couch to K program. Quit running gained a lot of weight back. Over the last year I tried casually losing weight by just sort of trying to eat a healthy diet  not calorie counting just you know adding a salad to the giant pizza serving. Frankly the fact that my parking lot at work is located half a mile from the building is the only reason I didnt actually GAIN a huge amount of weight during this time. I did at least maintain.Anyway Ive been having some knee pain that I thought might be a torn meniscus. Went to the ortho found out nope its actually arthritis. ARTHRITIS. I am  FREAKING YEARS OLD. Now I know that probably sounds old to some of the whippersnappers running around Reddit but arthritis at  is a huge damn wakeup call. I asked my doc what I could do to prevent it worsening and manage symptoms. He said glucosamine exercise and WEIGHT MANAGEMENT. I started counting calories that night. Since that day two weeks ago now Ive lost  lb and am feeling a lot better overall. Just the start of a long journey. I have about  total to lose before I get back to my halfmarathon weight and another  beyond that into normal BMI. Glad to be here with all of you!Edit Im WhatsitJan on mfp hit me up!,loseit,ctjebvs,1,t5_2rz8w

4673739,0,t1_ctjmhv5,TLDR I was in maintenance for  months before planning the surgery.The surgery decision was an interesting one. For several months after meeting goal I said I wasnt really interested in surgery. I wasnt a fan of my loose skin but I felt my displeasure over the skin was greatly trumped by the cost of they surgery. I dont like it but is it  dollars worth of not liking?One day I was getting a manicure and I had to extend my arms and the woman one of the largest women Ive ever seen not that its really relevant said in what Im sure she meant to be a joking manner Oh honey youre so tiny too tiny to have fat old lady arms like that!  I know she didnt mean any offense and thought the assurance I was tiny would cover up the jab about my arms so I didnt take personal offense to the comment but it did make me realize something Id been living my life up til that point thinking that no one else probably even noticedcared about my arms they probably werent that bad but I felt they were because I was the one who had to live with them. This brought it to my attention that yes other people did notice how bad my arms looked.I still didnt go out and seek surgery right away but it pushed me a bit more in that direction. Then it occurred to me that my main argument against the surgery was cost. I looked up the cost and found the price in my area to be much cheaper than I expected it to be. Then I considered a promise my mother had made to me when I first started losing weight That when I hit goal weight shed buy me a brand new wardrobe. I never cashed in on this promise because many shirts didnt fit around my arms so I felt unenthusiastic about getting new clothes. But maybe given the lower than expected cost of surgery and the idea that my parents were willing to put out a fair amount of money to reward my weight loss something could be worked out. I brought it up to my parents in March and they agreed to help me pay for the surgery so I immediately scheduled it at my earliest available date. ,loseit,ctjoc0d,26,t5_2rz8w

Id like to chime in with something that hasnt been mentioned yet for a lot of people especially newbies CICO is easier to start and maintain. The best diet you can have is the one you stick with. Yes the nutritional content of your food may be better if youre tracking your macros but can you imagine going from zero awareness of your food to eating less logging everything figuring out proper log entries tracking macros finding foods that fit your macros AND giving up your vices like beer and pizza? Thats way too much for some people and Id suspect a lot of folks trying to make too many changes at once abandon it within a week. Id also argue that you gain a lot of health benefits just being in a healthy BMI range even if youre eating a little dirty to get there.,loseit,ctp4ui6,1,t5_2rz8w

Well maybe when it was pen and paper not that I know but apps make it pretty easy once you learn how to use it. It was hard to make the decision to try counting calories because it meant going against the grain. I almost never talk about it to anyone to this day. If I do people shut down.

If youre getting a PhD youre probably quite analytical so think about it like this.  What has happened in the past is done. Its over. There is NOTHING you can do to change it. Just let it go. When you catch yourself dwelling about past mistakes remind yourself that all you can control is today.  Most importantly do NOT try to punish yourself on Tuesday for the sins of Monday. If you eat  calories a day but on Monday you ate  this does NOT mean that on Tuesday you have . It means you had a bad Monday. Thats it. End of. Its so so easy to try and make up for it on Tuesday. But its not healthy and in the long run it wont work. Youre a PhD student. You dont mind putting in the work. You know it will be worth it. So DONT take the easy way out. Do what youve always done.

Counting calories normal obsessing over every gram punishing oneself or letting calorie counting overtake your normal functioning  abnormal.

Because she was a little older too I could also say that when we choose the higher calorie option like eg chips etc if we continue eating this way people gain weight and become unhealthy and get other issues like heart disease etc we discussed daily calories for teens ladies etc making good choices nutrition protein self esteem etc. This way it was a lifestyle conversation in general not a talk specifically about her and her weight.,loseit,cty1xj0,2,t5_2rz8w

4812337,0,t1_cu14be5,Hard call. Normally Im a huge advocate hard cutting to nothing and working back. Dont go too too far though. Its easy to say cut until extremely low bodyfat but with such a low weight thats a pretty difficult thing to do. Id go until you see your top two maybe four abs. Then do a surplus for  weeks and cut a little farther than last time should only take  weeks less if you really work it. Then repeat this until you have a solid base and are cut or forever really its a good technique for staying lean year round. Itll also keep you from needing too much new clothes too fast and youll get progressively leaner while putting on mass. I prefer it to recomping which I find makes me frustrated with results in the gym and in front of the mirror.The thing is with shorter bulks and cuts your weight will flip flop a lot so dont focus on the numbers but instead how you look in the mirror.

This time  just set upon a course  and just be okay with the fact that it wont be perfect.  This time when life changes your food plan you keep logging no matter what you eat  no matter how long youre off plan youre logging all the food.  And the next meal the next moment the next day  youre just back on plan.  No guilt.  No makeups.  It was just an imperfect momentmealdayweekend and youre back on your plan.  Perfect is not required and not possible.  Strict is useful in ideal thinking but putting ideal thinking into practical use requires a blurring of the lines some tolerance for the vagaries of real life.Your log is not your judge.  Your log is just what happened.  Your log informs your rational brain. Its like youre on a car ride  and the road ahead gets closed due to a landslide.  You have to take a detour but after going five miles out of your way and losing some gas and time youre just back on your way in the right direction.  Youre not able to make up that gas youve lost that time but to get there safely you just keep going at a reasonable speed.   Its okay to get detoured.   Stuff happens.Review your logs every week.  Look for the three things youll do better next week when they come up.  If you actually do one of them better youre improving.

I didnt eat any fast food but I did eat another serving of potstickers for dinner and then proceeded to pour a bunch of sugary cereal in my mouth directly from the box. Then I had some Fritos. Then I had a chocolate bar and some Goldfish crackers. I didnt go over my TDEE so I guess its not a total loss. No significant exercise either. But I only promised X a week and hopefully tomorrow will be more productive on that end. ,loseit,cuaa4zl,2,t5_2rz8w

Easy snacks  hardy fruit like an apple or banana.  Nuts or popcorn. Also maybe look at things you tend to snack on yourself. Like Ill buy salted chickpeas instead of nuts as hey have less calories. Depends on what you crave. Im a salt person so I snack on seaweed and salty foods. I tried snacking on all the foods other people said but at the end of the day they didnt satisfy my cravings.

Its expensive to buy all at once but it lasts so much longer one scoop  cals  half a chicken breast basically.But also because I cant have  chicken breasts a day amp a ton of eggs because of cost and because of calories and trying to keep my diet maintainable .... ugh why do i love carbs so much.... Thats where proteiny veggies come in. They do have a lot of carbs but Its better than nothing. It all adds up yknow?  eggs maybe some chopped up ham some mozzarella over it with some spinach for breakfast quick protein shake for lunch Cottage cheese midday for a snack or maybe some pumpkin seedssmall handful of nuts edamame would be awesome to add in and some chicken or fish plus maybe half cup of peas leafy greens and mushrooms sauteed together and you might be close to your mark.My tactic is to try and hit nutrient dense but low calorie stuff for breakfast lunch and snacks then see what Im left with at the end of the day and make a nice hardy dinner that fills in the gaps for my proteinfat macros and the rest can be carbs if I want.,loseit,cugfd8u,2,t5_2rz8w

4948040,0,t1_cui73pi,I workout on a similar schedule I have a good sized breakfast around  and then go to the gym around  or so as it takes  hours for insulin levels to return to baseline.  The hard part is not snacking on between or otherwise you break the fast and insulin levels rise again.  To trigger the fat burn insulin levels need to be at or near base line.  I take a supplement containing Hydroxy Methylbutyrate  minutes prior to the workout if fasted to minimize the catabolic effects of associated with low insulin levels.  Not  necessary but Im not super huge so I try to hold on to my muscle mass as much as possible.  The only thing that Ive found that really effects my energy levels during a lifting session is how I ate the day before too much of a deficit and I feel weak even if I had a big breakfast as it isnt fully converted to muscle glycogen yet.  By the end of a  minute workout Im ready to eat a small child i dont think I could go   hours fasted LOL.  If I have extra energy I will go back later in the day to do some extra work.Sorry that was a lot of words.

First look at the types of foods youre eating. Make sure youre getting enough protein fat and fiber. Simple carbs are like rocket fuel to your body and get processed quickly so if you are eating a lot of them they can leave you hungry.If its just emotional hunger or wanting to eat for the sake of eating try things like mints gum flavored tea coffee etc.If youre making up for a week of being sick it might also be helpful to take a maintenance week sort of reset yourself and then go back to your deficit the week after.,loseit,cuqqk97,1,t5_2rz8w

5055767,0,t1_cuvcsb0,Thats only partly true. Theres shortchained and longchained sugars carbohydrates. Shortchained sugar e.g. fruit sugar is broken down more easily than longchained sugar e.g. raffinaded sugar thus longchained sugar is preferred by the body for storage in fat since its more stable. You can identify short vs. long chained carbs by slowly sucking on food. If it gets sweet instantly it is shortchained sugar that is broken down by your saliva already this is instant energy. If you need to suckle on something long before it gets sweet its longchained e.g. potatoes which have starch that gets broken down to sweet sugar slowly by your saliva. This is the carbs you want to avoid fruit sugar is fine unless really excessive.,loseit,cuvet99,1,t5_2rz8w

Thats it. Exercise is AWESOME. It can boost your mood help your mental health relieve stress build muscle and it can burn fat but you know what really kills body fat? Eating less. Seriously. Work out if you want to. Work out if you have time. Work out if you enjoy it. Do not work out expecting to lose weight from it. It does actually stress this in the FAQ which I understand you searched so this should not be brand new information. Get on MyFitnessPal. Start tracking and logging your food. Eat only your required calories i.e. your limit each day. That is how you lose weight. Or continue with weight watchers if that works for you as its the same basic premise eating less just paying for it instead of doing it for free. ,loseit,cv3tfcs,8,t5_2rz8w

While stomach skin and the like can be hidden by clothing my arms are always just sort of out there and someone once made a somewhat hurtful comment about my fat old lady arms which pushed me toward the surgery.  Recovery was somewhat difficult physically and I thank god I was off of school for months I wouldnt have been able to return to life for at least six weeks. It was more difficult psychologically though because I had to eat at a surplus and couldnt exercise so my weight just climbed.

After using MFP for so long I know the approximate number of calories in my goto meals so I keep a running tally in my head but I dont strictly log my intake anymore. Just remember what you learned about portion sizes and general nutritional info while you were losing apply that knowledge to your everyday life while maintaining and keep tabs on yourself by weighing in periodically.I maintain within a weight range as opposed to trying to keep a steady single weight  lbs... thats my goal weight    pounds to account for daily fluctuations. If my regular weigh ins start pushing the upper limit of that zone then Ill reign in my diet. Regular weigh ins are really all you need to do in order to maintain as long as you take corrective action when the weight goes back up.

Some of my portions had fewer calories than I thought but others had way way more.I actually find weighing everything to be way easier than measuring cupsspoons though! And there are far fewer dishes to wash. I generally take  approaches. For most foods I put my platebowl on the scale tare it then add food up to the weight Im looking for. Alternatively for stuff like peanut butter or margarine Ill put the whole container on the scale tare it and then take out some food until it hits the negative weight I want.

Instead of asking me to vacate the seat she pushed me leaned on me with her entire weight and said move fatty move. It didnt bother me too much. The next incident was when an  year old girl saw me and said look look look at the fatty. Still didnt really bother me.Im now . Ive never been on a date Ive never been kissed. I know that Im not hideous. Im just really really fat. All I need to do is lose weight.Ive got a lot going for me. Ive got a law degree with an excellent classification. Ive got a job and once I pass the bar exams which I received two partial scholarships for Ive got an even better job waiting for me. I was headhunted for this second job. Its with one of the best firms in the country. Life is great in that sense.Except that I cant stop eating. I love chocolate and I believe Im addicted to sugar. I have an awful habit. I buy chocolate in secret and then devour it when no one is looking. I even finished an entire pack of TimTam Double Coat in one day. Today I ate around  of a mediumsized Cadbury Black Forest bar. I love working out at the gym but I stopped going because of the aforementioned Bar exams. I then started the CK program which I also stopped because of the Bar exams. Id love to go back to the gym but I cant afford to sign up with the same gym they didnt autodeduct my gym fees like they were supposed to and I suspect that I owe them well over RM in their estimation and most other gyms around town require a large initial payment which once again I cant afford.Thats alright though Im returning to CK and Ill walk every day after work in order to lose this weight. I want to have a body I can be proud of fit and strong. I want to wear pretty clothes and be beautiful. I want to be able to walk into any clothes store and purchase off the rack instead of only being able to buy clothes from plus sized stores.Im  and weigh around kg. My first goal is to go out there and buy a weighing scale to get an accurate weight. My next goal is to never be this size or weight again. Finally I want to lose kg by the end of October.

Being fat and looking like shit is demoralizing and then people cope with that by getting even fatter. Why NOT focus on building selfrespect and looking good? Its one thing if you starve yourself into anorexia but theres a huge difference between having some self respect and caring about your appearance and an eating disorder.gtNatural weight is far from complete bullshit as you so nicely put it.If its not bullshit why is the average weight of Americans lbs heavier than it was in the s?gtBMI is a guideline. A guideline is a general rule principle or piece of advice. Its a great place to start but theres small chance that a general rule is going to optimize your body to its best.Theres a vanishingly small chance that being above the normal weight range for BMI guidelines is going to be healthier for any given individual than being in the normal weight range unless that person is an athlete with a low body fat percentage.gtThe individual must use their body as a compass. Our bodies are all unique.The individual must use the standard guidelines rather than his or her own hopes and wishes and feelings if he or she is overweight as its most likely that a combination of mental health issues bad habits and a metabolism and reward system rewired by years of poor eating is going to allow that person to be happy making healthy calorie appropriate food choices.See e.g. gtIt is known that the neuropeptides that regulate energy balance homeostatic processes through the hypothalamus also modulate the activity of dopamine cells and their projections into regions involved in the rewarding processes underlying food intake. It is postulated that this could also be a mechanism by which overeating and the resultant resistance to homoeostatic signals impairs the function of circuits involved in reward sensitivity conditioning and cognitive control.TLDR  Make progress or make excuses.

And I guess Im not there yet to be able to put in the effort needed to change.So how does one get to the point of being able to do that? I feel like Im at one level below wanting to change. I truly feel like I dont want to change because Im so good at living this way that its pure blissful comfort on my high days and life is easy because I always take the easiest route. But I want to want to change thats not a repeat typo. I want to be able to truthfully say Im going to do work to change even if its hard. But I cant because its not the truth right now. Ive only ever made significant change when I stagnated enough that it was more worth making some change like moving or getting a new job than to continue the same situation.Im sorry I keep firing back at you thank you for responding so well. I guess Im also really good at rationalizing anything and everything. In one sense somewhere deep in my mind I believe its completely possible that living an easy riskfree boring life like mine is just as good or better than the oftentouted take risks follow your passions etc. way because after all we all die and wont remember or be remembered eventually so just do what comes easiest to you.

5261774,0,t1_cvjdpc1,For some of us eating was a way of coping with stress getting healthier means changing that behaviour but we still need a way to cope with the stressful times. Hitting a number on a scale feels great but that cant be the only thing that makes you feel good or youll want to lose weight no matter the impact on your physical and mental health. I think talking to a professional for a session or two to get advice on coping strategies and self care ideas would be really helpful for your career and weight loss. I know how disheartening it can be to gain but bear in mind that fluctuations are totally normal especially for women. Im at maintenance. The week before my period my weight will fluctuate up  pounds even if my diet remains identical. And youre in a really physical job so the scale is only telling you half the story. When I got serious about fitness I lost a dress size while remaining exactly the same weight for over a month. I often gained or stayed the same while my body fat percentage decreased. The scale can be a blessing and a curse great to track your progress but damaging if you become hyper focused on the headline number. I think your awareness that this is a problem will help just be very very careful you are taking care of mind and body and find a way to cope with and get rid of the negative damaging thoughts. ,loseit,cvk905y,1,t5_2rz8w

5280453,0,t3_3nbw9e,There are a few different things you can do.Counting calories is one.Drinking more is important too. A lot of times you feel hunger but are thirsty. Or you can resolve the hungry feeling by drinking.Sport is another important part of a diet. Im not nesseceraly talking about signing up for a gym membership or joining a team sport. I try to squeeze in nordic walking a couple of times a week. Or riding your bike or walking instead of driving everywhere. There are a lot of things you can do while watching tv. The imporant part here isnt the additionally burned calories but the calories you didnt ingest while doing some activity.Food choices You want to eat chocolate or other things with a lot of calories? Why not. But eat something else first. If you eat noodles or rice first still a lot of calories but way less than sweets the you are half way full and wont eat as much of the much worse stuff.

5348944,0,t1_cvvc9e4,I know what youre saying but I could tell instantly that it was going to come off the wrong way here.Eating generally healthy food and getting a fair amount of exercise are more important to general health than obsessing over any specific number. That much we can agree on.However for weight loss  especially significant amounts  the amount of exercise you have to do to overcome excess calories is too high to be the most effective method. For the  calories that OP is talking about thats about  extra miles of daily exercise. Emphasis on EXTRA and DAILY. It has to be on top of whatever the normal longterm maintenance exercise is and if he skips a day it has to be made up elsewhere.And the difference is even more pronounced the more they have to lose. People who get up to the  lb range must by backwards calculation have been eating  calories per day. To suggest to someone in that situation that Even if someone is obese being active would help more. is just not good advice. Cutting out  calories from their diet  while hard  is a lot more attainable than walking  extra miles a week. And it will serve them better in the long run.Not to mention the other issues like damage on joints due to impact stress or increased appetite due to muscles and carb burning. And exercise does draw from carbs not fat as indirect calorimetry measurements can prove.So while overall health is important for the longterm and exercise is an important component of that most people who come to loseit should absolutely focus on diet and over exercise.,loseit,cvvdz3p,3,t5_2rz8w

This phenomenon is commonly known as the whoosh effect and overeating on carbohydrates triggers the release of water molecules. Just because your dining venues offered a lot of carbs doesnt mean that translate to automatic weight gain. Potatoes are extremely filling and bread can be also when coupled with fat and protein. If you were eating balanced meals you probably didnt overeat as much as you perceived and probably didnt have time to snack throughout the day. Walking everywhere would have increased your TDEE therefor accommodating for any actual overeating. But I ate so much! is subjective. We have no idea how much you actually ate.

Now what worked for me might not work for you but this worked really well for me. Try and practice mindfulness. Be aware of what youre doing when youre doing it. Its challenging to do since we do so many things on autopilot without realizing it. Id catch myself staring into the pantry looking for a snack and Id stop and think about how I was feeling. If I wasnt truly hungry Id tell myself to go do something else. Whether it be something like play video games clean my room laundry dishes read Reddit.

IT IS DELICIOUS. When I crave a donut or something damn this hits the spot. Add half a hard boiled egg and you got a good little breakfast there. Its super fast and easy and clocks in at  calories. If I have more time Ill do half a grapefruit  honey pop it under the broiler for a few minutes then add a sprinkle of coconut flakes and pop it back in and you got a delicious broiled grapefruit with toasted coconut for breakfast at  calories. Sorry I dont have a picture of it cause I havent done it in a while. Midmorning snack Low sodium rice cake   oz of goat cheese  crushed red pepper. Delish! And its  calories. Lunch Veggies  hummus is usually my base and then Ill add change the sides around daily. Today I had some sweet chili pistachios and a light string cheese totaled up to  calories. I dont like salad but I love veggies so Ill almost always do that and keep it fresh by changing the sides. I also like raspberries tuna plantain chips pretzels and avocado as sides.Afternoon snack I get a crazy sweetcraving around  so I usually go with a caramel rice cake  peanut butter totaling  calories. My husband will make me my breakfast and hell usually also have the wasa or make himself something else but dinner we always eat together and it changes every night.

I have no idea what your height is you sound so tiny if your ideal weight is  Im   so apparently I should aim for around  which sounds fine for me but we shall see when I get there.All the time I think about how I just sidestepped the biggest bullet of my life diabetes my mother had type  and i EASILY could have acquired type . I think about gaining weight and it makes me honestly panic I start sweating regretting essentially everything Ive eaten I end up fasting for a day or two which is alright it usually takes me about that long to get a firm handle on my fear again for this. I watch a lot of shows like my pound life and heavy and shows like that just to understand where I fit on the spectrum and to really look at what I never want to go back to or end up like Im sure that sounds horrible aloud id never be mean or nasty to these people.I feel like there is no point in your life that being healthy and active will ever NOT be a choice it doesnt come naturally because of whatever society family habits growing up genetics your lifestyle whatever and I know that fear in that moment where you think you have gained weight maybe youre going back to it and how do you know youre not I think like that from time to time but I really try not to and when I do I step on the scale to help give me some objectivity I take progress pictures to compare talk to a close friend I trust her not to bullshit me about it.I think if I gained back the weight I would also kill myself I dont blame you.

My real goal is to hike again.In my younger years I did about  miles on the Appalachian Trail.  Im focusing on next SeptemberOctober on Skyline Drive.  It is a little over  miles and the AT crisscrosses the road.  Ive driven it but never hiked it.  Ultimate goal is maybe a thruhike on the AT in the years to come.  Not holding myself to that just a thought.  Im focusing on diet day with  minutes of stationary biking xweek.  Im down under  for the first time in years and I want to keep it that way.  Its difficult not gonna lie.  I just want to feel better.  Both about myself and just physically.  Ive found that exercising helps me sleep better at night makes me crave water and helps boost my mood.  I think Im at that point where my day doesnt feel complete until I start stretching and then get on the bike.  And I like that feeling. TLDR  F  currently under  lbs for the first time in a few years going to keep lowering the scale so I can get back to hiking.,loseit,cwicxwq,1,t5_2rz8w

For example if youre trying to kick an addiction or solve another issue take care of that first. Do one thing at the time or either way focus more on one. Engaging your willpower on too many fronts will drain you and its discouraging. Think of the things you want. BUT DONT LIE! Why are you dieting?

So when I feel like eating a whole large pizza I think what do I want more? Be attractive or pizza?. Usually even though it wont  solve the issue it will mitigate it. E.g. Ill eat a slice of pizza or two instead of a whole large pizza. Its actually super effective for me at the gym.

Stick with water black coffee and unsweetened tea or diet soda if you like it. Eat only half of what you get at the restaurant and then save the other have for a future meal. Dont mindlessly snack i.e. pour out a small predetermined amount of chipscandyetc before eating it rather than just eating out of the full bag. Its really easy to eat  calories worth of Oreos without even blinking.If your hotel has treadmills and if you have time try to do around  minutes at a slight incline each day youll burn around  calories depending on how fast you run.Other than that check out the rlosit FAQ on the sidebar.

5638815,0,t1_cwvti64,Dont focus on it being the last time. Focus on making small gradual changes for life. There is no time just big victorious and small ones. You failed in the past because you viewed things in black and white. You viewed it as you were either  successful or  a failure. Losing weight especially the amount you need to lose will not come quick. You need to focus on changing fundamental habits about yourself. Many people get hung up on making ALL of the changes at once. It just isnt possible. You cant change a life time of bad habits at one go. Focus on doing small things first for example instead of eating a whole large pizza eat  or whatever ratio you eat. Celebrate when you stop eating at  that is your victory. If you fail and eat the whole thing dont give up just say I took a step back but I wont make it worse by eating a pint of ice cream too. That in and of itself is a victory you messed up and recovered. Thats what will keep you going for the long term. For example for me a BIG part of it was eating more vegetables. I used to eat none. I hated veggies with a passion. I slowly started working veggies in as a goal. I didnt focus on the weight loss I focused on the healthy change. If I lost weight good if not I have made one healthy change and mastered it on to the next one. Baby steps to success are much more successful than trying to sprint there.Also go back in therapy. It is not a magical bullet you have to be able to put in the work. If one therapist doesnt click try more. There is nothing they can easy to magically cute you. What they can do is help you see things and help you break the habits try to build healthy coping mechanisms.Lastly think about getting more mobile. It is damn hard especially at your weight and it can hurt. Once again dont jump in hardcore you will hate it. Start by doing stuff like walking five to ten minutes and then very slowly build.Lastly I leave this hereThis man went from  lbs down to under  and still going.

You may be going through a body recomposition stage where you are losing fat but gaining muscle elsewhere too. A scale wont show this. Change what you eat  either by helping to cook or by requesting specific foods in your care package. Exercise  The final option is to focus on adding more exercise and being patience.

5765347,0,t1_cxbq6md,I am not there to see you through the entire day but I will add my opinion. Drinking water and tea I assume it is unsweet is a great way to start. You need around  calories to maintain you daily energy level. Your walking and other exercises according to what I was able to look up burns around . That is leaving you with  calories a day. I dont know what your diet is like but  calories a day is quite a bit if you eat correctly.If you feel like you are eating under your calories that you need and still not seeing improvement then you might want to up your workout. If you are trying to drop the pounds focus on cardio. Instead of walking  miles try to run or jog a little bit of the way. Try one of the CK apps. Keep in mind that if you are lifting weights you might be adding weight through muscle. And dont get in your mind that fat turns to muscle. You can be fat and have a lot of muscle.My advice would be to make sure you are eating under your calories maybe around ? and try and to more intense cardio. ,loseit,cxbqt61,2,t5_2rz8w

I have to deal with this shit constantly.  I lost around  lbs and people always tell me that it was easy for me because Im a guy.  Then they come in with packaged food from Starbucks and buy lunch  times a week.  You dont have to say much.

5886370,0,t3_3vttyj,YMMV Im not a doctor anecdotal story etc. Im shorter  and younger  than you but right in your weight range  this morning. I do rketo and it has worked fantastically for me in the past. I came back to my home country and got pulled really deep into my dads business. I got stressed out and gained about a hundred pounds that I had kept off for about a year and a half prior without issues. It was a combination of old environment old habits too busy to eat right etc. I ate a total of about  calories all day and I feel totally fine. No shakes no pains not uncomfortable no crash. You should probably not aim that low especially on the regular. I eat if I get hungry and I have days I go over my daily limit of  and change that was recommended by MFP. But if Im not hungry Im not gonna put food in just because. I felt fine today so I didnt eat until I got home from work,loseit,cxr8j2n,1,t5_2rz8w

And congrats on resisting the allure of fast food!But once your relationship with food starts to feel less overwhelming it may be worth it to start reintroducing foods like Burger King in moderation before you reach your goal weight.

And lets assume that every single calorie in your cookies went straight to your hips.  Thats  days of deficit.  If you can maintain  days of deficit between binges like that then youre still losing.

You are not on the brink of death because of your weight. With the pattern of your ED and then weight gain and then pregnancy I want to make sure that youre focusing on your mental health as well and establishing a healthy body image. Look at what your body can do  it created nurtured and sustains life. Thats incredible.

My all time favorite gym is probably the NYC Parks and Recs.   For like  bucks a year you get access to every single Parks and Recs gym and many of them have pools.  The one in Chelsea has a basketball court dance studios full cardio room full weight room etc.That said for non new yorkers I highly suggest trying to find a non chain gym owned by a bodybuilder.  In my experience those are usually the best.Avoid the trendy new crap that is overpriced and makes fitness seem like more than it really is  its simple.

6012108,0,t1_cy7kkv8,Im not a professional in the health care field however many people in my family have had bariatric surgeries. In our culture of folks wanting cure alls and fast results insurance companies and doctors make you prove yourself in a way by maintaining a healthy diet and exercise before they spend allot of money and risking your death but doing the surgery. If you cant change the mindset that caused you too soothe reward or otherwise abuse yourself with food you wont be successful. Not all people who get weightloss surgery are mindless over eaters there are genetic and emotional issues that add up to being obese. If you can overcome that and retrain yourself even for a year the added benefit of the faster weightloss from surgery will boost confidence and help solidify in your mind that making healthy choices is worthwhile.  My dad worked out everyday in fact many of my family did. We just used food to go along with every mood. Since the surgery my dad had continued to work out daily. He was in his early s but got buff and und marathons. In fact he was obese for so long his mom ago lives with him and my mom and has dementia doesnt recognize him she only remembers him as obese and diabetic. They chuckle about how she chews my mom out for cheating on her husband whenever she sees mom going somewhere with dad.

I believe you only have limited dicipline to do things that are exhausting to you  diffrent for everybody. Now when you start out to lose weight this task takes all your dicipline leaving you with none to deal wth other exhausting tasks such as cleaning around the house. Now heres the good news you can expand your discipline level by not giving in and adding to that things becoming passive skills for you  such as healthy eating habbits that dont take that much dicipline to maintain or even sources of energy sport So i would not say it is impossible in generall but not possible for you RIGHT NOW. In my opinion that is the challenge of life and things DO get easier. Just keep it up and try not to find excuses to not challenge your inner dicipline bar!

I can relate to many of the things that you wrote like ignoring physical pain thinking that im going to die early anyway basically not giving a fuck about my weight. Now to your questions Yes eating kcalday is perfectly fine. Walking with your dog and walking to work is all the exercise you need if you want you can increase it once you already lost some weight but now the main focus is to stay at kcal. For weight loss yes  a calorie is a calorie. It doesnt matter if high carb low carb high fat low fat. What you want is to get a good amount of protein in to avoid too much muscle loss. If you are on a kcalday deficit you will lose around an average of kgweek thats true. Ive lost on average around .kgweek since i started  months ago. You dont lose weight every week though some weeks you lose .kg while others you lose .kg thats water fluctuation and a normal thing that you will get used to soon enough.Good luck with your journey man its worth it!

Just explain to her that you arent trying to change her arent judging her drinking and that you love her just the way she is but youre doing this for yourself and its really important to you. Especially with drinking it causes the nonquitter to examine their habits more closely.  Also eating and drinking together is a form of bonding. Maybe while shes munching on chips have carrots with hummus. Sip diet soda or sparkling water while shes drinking. More importantly make time for other indulgences together. If food was your way of bonding before find a new shared activitypassion together.  My boyfriend nowhusband couldnt get on board with my running schedule at first. He just didnt understand it thought I was going overboard and got cranky when it affected his schedule. Now HES the dedicated runner and he totally gets it!

6207238,0,t3_40hcyj,Some of this is totally reasonable despair over your betrayal. Some of this is chemical in so much as being unhealthy can cause depression. But some of this may also be psychological. Try to get some counseling to work this out. Work out your mind and emotions as well as your body. Im glad you can work our and drop weight. Good for you. Youll look like your old self in no time. Believe me especially at  youre at the peak of your hot years. You can definitely get hot. And stretch marks meh. Theyre really not a big deal trust me. I dated a guy who used to be really fat. He had lost a bunch of weight by the time we started dating and had even needed to get his loose skin removed so he had that big scar under his abdomen from the surgery. I remember the scar but you know what I dont remember? I dont remember seeing stretch marks. Stretch marks can fade. Even if they dont trust me theyre not a big deal. Moreover if you lose the fat and work on gaining muscle youll fill out your body real nice. Im  and losing weight. I gotta tell you... I feel fucking hot right now. Like I like the progress Im making. And I cant wait to get to where I want to be. And this coming from someone who has been severely fat their whole life. I know someone who has been fit most of their lives and only had  years of being overweight can bounce back. Heres a progress pic that I bookmarked that always encourages me.   Do you see any stretch marks? Do you think any woman would care when she looks at him? No. You can get there too.But more importantly... even though you can very well achieve the body youre hoping for... please work on yourself psychologically and emotionally. Were not our fat were not our stretch marks were not our betrayals our worth does not come from being sexually desirable or rich or smart. Its very possible that if you dont work on yourself youll be setting yourself up for a major wreck in the future. You may become incredibly shallow only wanting to be with people who have the perfect physique. Or you may become incredibly cynical believing no one can really love you. Or you may become sexually reckless substituting the safety of sex which offers fake intimacy for the beautiful lifegiving intimacy of relationship. There are so many pitfalls you can fall into if you dont take some time to work on yourself emotionallypsychologically. In the end no matter how great your physique. You will get old. You will lose your sexual attractiveness. Your body will deteriorate one way or another. Its fine if you want to be hot again youre . Its normal. But dont make it everything. ,loseit,cyv72vl,1,t5_2rz8w

I dont know how old you are but I cant imagine what youre going through with your pregnancy problems but I can help with the depression. Through my weight loss process I use the word process because its been one I went through some severely dark times. Thoughts of suicide extreme fatigue inability to find the joy in life any more. Almost everyone asks me if I feel so much better after losing  pounds and my answer is always nope. I was miserable when I was fat and Im still pretty miserable now that Im less fat. Now this isnt meant to be discouraging its meant to show you that even though most people think losing  pounds would make them happy depression isnt something you can just run away from. You should look into finding a therapist to talk to about your emotions. You went through a very traumatic experience and a therapist can help you work through the emotions so they no longer become debilitating. Talk to your doctor and see if they can make a recommendation. ,loseit,cyvxu60,2,t5_2rz8w

6238895,0,t3_410xqc,You arent broken.   I would be willing to bet that you actually do feel better at the smaller weight and just dont realize it because the loss was gradual.    When you lose a pound or two a week  your body gets used to the weight being smaller as it happens so you dont notice the changes as much.   After losing  pounds I would have sworn I didnt feel any different than before.   After gaining  of that back  I totally realized how wrong I was. The difference is I gained that  really quickly so I didnt get gradually used to it.    As for eating.   Yes and no.    Could I still eat an entire pizza?  Yep  yep  yep.   I generally dont because I dont want to have to work it off  but could i? am I still tempted?  Yep completely.    To be honest though  it would make me feel really physically ill because Im not used to that volume of food.    Sweets are a whole other story.   I love sweets.  Sweets used to be my major down fall  but after losing a bunch of weight I just cant eat that much sweet stuff without feeling sick.

Unfortunately theres not much we can do about this we just need to focus on the fact that no longer being obese will dramatically improve our health and life spans in the long run and that being a healthy weight with loose skin still looks better than being obese without loose skin.Secondly everyone is different and there is no sort of proven method to prevent loose skin or to at least significantly minimise it. Generally the younger you are when you lose the weight the less weight you lose and the less stretch marks you have gotten gaining weight are key to minimising it all that and good genetics helps. Some people lose lbs and only have loose skin on their belly and not necessarily a lot of it others have it on their pecks arms and legs. The fact you only have it on your stomach is a really good sign. From a surgeon I spoke with this about as I feel like I will definitely need skin removal surgery due to the fact I am losing near lbs in total they generally say that if you give your skin a year or two itll tighten up a bit but not necessarily completely. There is no quick solution and no easy answer lose the weight give it time and youll no doubt see improvements.,loseit,cyz32mr,1,t5_2rz8w

That fact combined with the fact that everyones read articles or seen TV specials about eating disorders combine to make any discussion of weight loss goals risky territory.I try to avoid the topic honestly but if it comes up I just mention that my main interest these days is on overall health and fitness. That seems to generate fewer reactions.I will say that I encounter quite a few people who say that they want to lose more weight when actually theyre at a normalhealthy weight but their overall fitness is low  so they look a bit flabby or dont look very lean or strong.

6277349,0,t3_41l1e9, pounds a week is pretty excessive for someone your size. Most experts say that anything over  pounds per week is not healthy. Severely obese people can get away with more aggressive deficits.The water weight thing is very normal as most people when they start are changing from eating a lot of junky  processed foods that are often high in sodium to cleaner eating. You combine the reduced sodium intake with increased water intake and your body decides it can stop retaining as much water. Drinking more water does not mean more water weight it most often means you are going to lose some. Unless you have iron will power it is probably better to take it slow and make sustainable life changes instead of pushing to try to look good for summer. ,loseit,cz35wjn,2,t5_2rz8w

Accurate consistent logging is definitely the most important thing for me.

In terms of tips for us heavier losers I would say that we need to talk more about exercising our ability to be patient. I havent quite made my peace with my timeline Im at least a year away from entering maintenance because of my impatience and I see a lot of posters who struggle with this as well.

The only time in my life I was convinced I had a thyroid problem because I wasnt losing weight I wasnt actually counting my food and I was surprise surprise eating a lot more than I thought I was. Ive read about people with PCOS who are still losing at more than  calories a day. My situation is totally different from yours but sometimes when I get stuck I eat at maintenance for a few days to rejig my metabolism. I know people say nothing you can do can affect your metabolism one way or another but varying my eating up for a week or two can really move the scale. I will usually  eat at maintenance or  eat different kinds of foods that I usually eat. So  eat carbs if I dont normally eat a lot unless youre on keto then dont do that eat protein if I dont normally eat that alot etc. Something else I started IF a few weeks ago and have found weight dropping faster lbweek from a previous incredibly slow rate of .lbweek.

I have a long commute so it took a while to figure out how many calories I need to eat and when.According to the medical community you can safely lose  of your body weight per week. Weigh lbs? lbs per week is no problem. lbs? .lbs is still safe. Just make sure you hit your minimum calories of  for a male and  for a female.MFP forums can be really toxic at times. I avoid it completely. Losing slow is good advice because it prevents people from doing crash diets and falling off the wagon. If you get the new lifestyle developed and have stuck with it then talk to your doctor and come up with your own personal plan.Edit IIFYM is big on body building. Their numbers are specifically developed to avoid muscle loss.  calories at lbs does sound reasonable to me though. I certainly wouldnt call it reckless but it sounds about right. Its probably what I was doing at that weight but I wasnt lifting. IIFYM frowns on cardio guys like me though.

Junk food etc.  And living with parents and not feeling like I have a home sometimes.  But these are things to work on.  I guess I need to eat more salads.  Lettuce etc.  I think I can do a mcdonalds side salad.  I think even a mcdonalds crispy chicken salad isnt a terrible thing I know the grilled is much healthier than crispy but the McDonalds grilled vs crispy is yuck  also for healthy choice meals chicken in those is also yucky.  They should have healthy choice dinners with tofu instead of the chicken.   Also last week I was doing ok.   Then I had a day where I had to go get an MRI.  and I guess I should have gone straight to the gym since it was a rainy day.  Instead I made the mistake of going home and seeing what was up there and it was dad.  And it was just like ugh....dunno not really wanna hang there but he was like lets see a movie and the movie wasnt til  and it was  and he was gonna go out and I was like Ill go with you.  So at the mall I was hungry hadnt eaten all day so I went went to get a chicken philly.  Then spending more time than I wanted with him and I hadnt really gymmed that day and I missed my opportunity to go socialize on Friday since I decided to spend time with dad.  So then my brain needed to go out out and get ice cream and crap junk food. So thats just a cross section of the bad day.  Since that last Friday Ive been more on track.  So this  Friday tomorrow i put it on my calendar to go socialize.  It does sometimes grind my gears i have to feel like i have to drive an hour to get to where i need to socialize instead of something more manageable like  minutes.

6389622,0,t3_42jrda,Day  M SW  GW I have been overweight my entire life because food has been my crutch when Im depressed or stressed out. Approximately  years ago I got into a huge health kick and dropped my weight from  all the way down to  through long bicycling trips many hours at the gym and heavy dieting. Shortly after that began the most stressful period of my life Nursing school. Nursing school was a near constant state of high levels of stress for the entirety of it. Following that  months ago I started my first job as a Registered Nurse and even more stress trying to learn everything that school didnt prepare me for too much!Now that Im settled in my weight hasnt changed for about  weeks now and Im finally ready to get back into a healthy lifestyle. I just joined the local YMCA and plan on starting swimming regularly as well as a weight lifting routine. My next step after that is figuring out a way to eat healthier around my  hour work days where I rarely take a break long enough to eat more than a bite of junk food. ,loseit,czfxmna,1,t5_2rz8w

6404875,0,t1_czhit9k,I mean theres absolutely the possibility that this is malicious or uncaring or whatever but it could also just be misplaced desire to help. Years ago my mom offered to pay me for every pound lost. Cant remember what the offer was... it did motivate me to try but unfortunately I didnt know about CICO and just tried to exercise my weight away. You can imagine how well that went. Doesnt mean my mother didnt love me or accept me as I was! She just thought maybe I could use the help of having extrinsic motivation. She wasnt  wrong.So yeah itd be shitty if OPs weight loss was the friends idea and he was like Yo I think you should be less fat so if you make X goal Ill pay you . Especially shitty if OP was hard up for cash and needed help with rent or something and the friend said Yeah I have the  but you have to lose weight first. That would be grounds to cut back on the friendship. However if OP said Man I really want to lose weight for my health etc etc but I just cant getstay motivated and the friend said Well would it help if I offered you a juicy monetary reward? then that would be generous and supportive.Unfortunately that kind of reward system is unlikely to produce sustainable success but OP and his friend probably dont realize that. No need to judge the friend hisher intentions could definitely be good.ufatfuckfatfuck love yourself. Think of the person you love most besides yourself. Doesnt that person deserve a healthy body? What a gift! Wouldnt you do whatever you could for that person to have a healthy body? Unfortunately thats something you can only do for yourself. But its a great mindset to love yourself and feel that you deserve a healthy body. Furthermore improving your own health is a gift to those who love you. You dont have to have that mindset but for me it helped. For a couple of years I really didnt have a very positive view of myself  body image tied up in selfworth. Having a friend who never expressed any concern about my weight aside from how it related to my health but did express platonic admiration for me as a person really boosted my selfesteem. Once I had a really positive estimation of my selfworth I just felt like I should be in a body that matched. Everybody wins.Regardless of your philosophicalemotional approach familiarize yourself with the concept of CICO calories in calories out. Calculate your BMR and TDEE. Get yourself on MyFitnessPal and start logging your food. Fuck the exercise. You can add that in once you have the diet down pat. ufunchords has some posts stickied and sidebard that explain all these concepts and why exercise is kind of a red herring for weight loss.

As far as your period  honestly menstrual weirdness is really common and if youre in college Im assuming youre possibly even still a teenager which further opens your menstrual cycle up for weirdness. It can be a sign of bigger problems but it isnt always. Youre probably fine but make sure youre getting enough fat and protein in your diet. Im not a doctor so take this with a grain of salt and use your own judgment but what I would do is wait and observe my cycle.

Feel free to get ideas from it if you would like to.  How to get started using MyFitnessPal  Thats what I suggest for your food program.  Dont start with a grand shopping list just do your normal thing and see where you are  then improve it over time.  gt I really want to lose fat as possible because someone who I really like has invited me to a cruise.  Im not changing just for her but because I know I need to be healthier and better than where I am right now.She is going to have her own selfdoubts so dont worry about that.  Nobody thinks theyre perfect.  Go have fun and get started.That said you can move from before toward after quite a bit in  weeks.  That guy works out with weights or bodyweight fitness  resistance training instead of cardio.   is where to start to pick your starting routine.Just the confidence you will start to project after  weeks will make you more attractive to others generally.  So go do it!If you do this while using MyFitnessPal set MyFitnessPal to lose  pound per week and not  per week.  This gives you some extra calories to spend on your workouts and workouts need the food both for energy and nutrientsprotein.  Because youre working out the bathroom scale will jump all over the place water retention but keep going and dont let the scale concern you for about a month after starting a workout.

The first kg was mostly waterweight. Your bodyweight fluctuates daily sometimes even kg. You cant go off shortterm scale changes. Also if youre logging your exercise calories into MFP and eating them back that might cause you to underestimate your net calories so if you do that beware.Plateaus only happen if you eat too much or your misinterpreting whats happening as a plateautldr Just stick to what youre doing its working!,loseit,czjho7v,-2,t5_2rz8w

Requiring large quantities of macronutrients does not mean they are more important than the micronutrients just that the requirements are different and the body isnt harnessing energy from them but needs them nonetheless in order to harness energy from the larger macronutrients. Most of the micronutrients that we eat function as cofactorscoenzymes facilitating many important chemical reactions in the body. Being deficient in them could lead to major problems down the road.

6496627,0,t1_czqx1kp,Thanks and youre right I definitely need to incorporate more exercise no matter what I weigh. I think I made it sound like I want to go back to a lifestyle of sitting around eating junk all day haha. Actually Ive always eaten relatively healthy food and growing up my parents never bought pop or junk food and all meals were home made with normal portion sizes. That probably instilled good eating habits. My brothers and I have always been skinny and my parents were also both skinny until middle age. I was also athletic until about age  when I moved away for University and became depressed amp sedentary. I would occasionally eat a box of cookies or a whole frozen pizza maybe once every  months and it didnt affect my weight. But now that I think about it I was probably eating well the rest of the time so those extra calories didnt matter much. I dont have a car so I walk more and I also run up stairs and fidget a lot so that probably helps burn a few calories.To your point about age  I know that you require less calories as you get older but in the span of a a couple years age   for example there shouldnt be much change.  months ago I had consistently weighed  lbs. Im off the medication now amp my appetite is normal again so I would expect that my normal eating habits would maintain my weight even if Im relatively sedentary. If I find it a struggle to keep weight off for the next few years Id be skeptical that its just due to age or suddenly eating too much. If I start gaining weight easily Ill have to monitor my dietexercise carefully to see if Im doing anything different than before. Im not planning to take antidepressants anymore but if your mom still takes them she might want to consider switching to Wellbutrin. It often causes weight loss and is one of the only antidepressants to do so. Ive found counsellingCBT to work better for me so maybe if thats a viable option for her she could try it out. ,loseit,czras8c,1,t5_2rz8w

You dont have to lose lbs per week or whatever your husband is doing. You can lose  lb per wk or  or even  lb per week. Find the rate of weight loss that works well for YOU. Its not a competition. Your husband probably has more muscle and a higher TDEE. Maybe he has different activity patterns or different genes or whatever. You have to find that path that works for you.Re the struggle to stay within a calorie kimit oh man do I hear you. Its a rare day that I can stay to my  kcal plan. Usually I end up more like . But I used to routinely eat  so thats a huge improvement. I feel like even just having stopped gaining is a massive triumph. Focus on how much better youre doing than you were before.For me about that calorie struggle some thoughts recently Ive been focusing on just making absolutely sure that caloriesin is LESS THAN caloriesout even if its not very much less. For calories out I use the realtime caloriesburned updates from my fitbit it gives a constant running update of calories burned so far during the day estimated from a continuous record of heart rate. Ive also added a lot more walking ampamp other exercise into my day. for calories in theres a ton of little tricks to eat less wo feeling deprived. All the little tricks add up. My current tricks include no calories in my coffee I switched to americanos switching from beer to carbonated water  T of fresh squeezed lime juice this is my goto drink now when I get home from work. I love it! It weaned me off beer totally fasting  day per month seems to help my body recalibrate its sense of hunger for the next several weeks. edit  thought if some more  drinking a glass of water before I eat keeping precut celery amp carrots handy keeping my hands busy when I watch tv my roommate knits I do snare drum paradiddles on a rubber practice pad  whatever works!. Recently I am getting really into a thing of taking smaller bites ampamp really relishing each one it makes meals last like x longer and gives me more chew time. All those things help. Look at every aspect of your food routine and think about things you can change ways to break stubborn habits. But my main focus now is not to worry about how fast Im losing weight but just keep it a loss rather than a steady state or a gain. ,loseit,cztmdjy,11,t5_2rz8w

Basically if I was to eat say  caloriesday I dont think my body would go in to any specific calorie saving mode but I do think I would naturally do less. I might spend a little more time on the couch walk shorter distances nap more or just simply do less only for the reason that I wont have the energy or motivation to do anything.I have  studies to back this I can only go by personal experience and power meter results from my bike between days where Im low on calories vs high on calories.

I always computed the calories by plugging in the equation on my own calculator. Differences in . or . comes from if youre looking at net calories ONLY burned from running or gross calories inclusive of running and who knows what else calories.

Grab your phone put on your favorite music and walk for five songs. Thats it. Sing along I do who gives a fuck youre at the gym and making a difference no one can judge you for that. Also take the time and go to a shoe store but like an actual runners store where they watch how you walk to tell you what shoe to get and then go on amazon and look in the big and tall for new pants. At the shoe store they should tie them for you and what I do is while sitting prop my foot up on my leg put the shoe on and tie it while its up there. The decision is on you at our size we need to drink a gallon a day go to the grocery store and for your first week by  one gallon jugs to hold yourself accountable  its what I do  and pump that shit all day. It costs . a gallon not bad. or reuse one gallon jug but I dont like my tap water. Last thing I will say  I was in your exact position literally nobody can do it for you. You have to stop feeling bad for yourself and get your shit together. Guess what? It is probably gonna take us nearly  years to  get ALL of the weight off and a year to get looking pretty good. Thats a year from TODAY. Start counting now not tomorrow not a week from tomorrow TODAY because tomorrow will never come if you keep saying that.

Unrelated to that I developed a raging throat infection in the evening which kept me up all night and now Im totally sleepdeprived and sick. I had been hoping to get my remaining  workouts in Friday through Sunday but now I doubt Ill be well enough to work out again until Sunday at the very earliest.Feeling down on myself about the scale which is up surely a fluctuation and Ive decided not to weigh myself again until Monday and about the general one step forward two steps back nature of my progress so far. After reading all the success stories and comments on this subreddit I do think I should start using MFP and really hold myself to account on portion sizes and calories. I hate the idea of calorie counting but Ill get over it if thats what it takes to see consistent progress although Im more concerned that figuring out calories and portion sizes will be such a mission given my current circumstances no idea how I will get my hands on a digital scale for a start. Anyway something to revisit on Sunday when hopefully Ill start feeling human again.To prevent weekend temptations I make sure I wake up at a reasonable time keep my computer and smartphone off until the afternoon and spend the morning and early afternoon reading working on a hobby or doing something active outdoors. Ive found that starting each weekend day off on the right foot is the best way to keep myself from the kind of lazy TV mode that always leads to weekend bingeing.

6644247,0,t1_d06kcv7,gt you still shouldnt be skipping means. You need to eat smaller amounts of food more often. Try eating  calories at a time five times a day. This will help to keep your metabolism running pretty well and it will keep you from getting the hunger pangs youre talking about.This is a myth your metabolism doesnt care how frequently you eat. Meal frequency is entirely about what works for the individual. Some people feel like you do  theyre less hungry if they eat several small meals. Some people like me feel less hungry with just one or two large meals per day thats the whole point of intermittent fasting.Agreed though that OP needs to address the fact that hes drastically undereating before worrying about anything else.,loseit,d06kmmc,4,t5_2rz8w

I find that french cut canned taste different than chopped in the can too! Fresh vegetables have more crunch but fresher taste. Canned have a softer feel with more of a home cooked taste.

Im definitely aiming for a certain appearance and Ive hit the point where I still have fat to lose but now since Im doing weight training weight isnt a good measure anymore. While I do want to lose fat I dont want to lose muscle. Pursuing weight loss will mean that muscle will go with it as well.In my case Im more interested in getting a low body fat level  or even less. On top of that I also want to improve the size of certain muscles. If it means that I gain weight then so be it. Ultimately the determinant now is no longer weight rather body fat.,loseit,d0k0i6l,2,t5_2rz8w
6774215,0,t3_46nyfw,Hello everyone I have a quick question for you that Im having trouble figuring out. Ive read the FAQ but I do not see the answer to the question I have and upon googling I get very varied answers. My question is thisI am using Fitbit not MFP to track my calories so it tells me how much I burn by walking around. If I only have say  calories left for the day does that mean I can walk around the block with my dog for a few miles and earn more so I can have say the cake that someone brought over? If I am going to have something indulgent I make sure I am saving calories elsewhere but surprises happen and cake is good stuff so if its calories in vs calories out if I put out more I get to have more right? Whenever I google this it basically says if you are counting calories that is ALL you can have but when I kickbox dont I get to eat a little more because I burned more? It seems like thats how its works but google has got me all mixed up and Im terrible at math. Thank you so much for any and all guidance I really appreciate it!edit forgot a key word,loseit,d0k524m,1,t5_2rz8w

6836336,0,t3_49clr4,Diet can and has been used as the sole method for weight loss for shit loads of people. If thats the route you want to go then go for it my friend. Its better that youre losing fat and not exercising than being obese and not exercising thats for sure.The reason we like to use the  or  rule is because while we know that diet is really all you need you should have some form of exercise because it really is crucial for long term health. Whether your poison is walking running lifting or what ever. It is a important thing that if you can do it you should do it.Something Ill add is that I initially started with dietary changes alone fully intending to not do any exercise.Something happened after that first week. The better I ate the better I slept. The better I slept the more energy I had. All of that energy coursing through my body actually made me want to exercise. Once I started I really began enjoying it. It also made me sleep even better and really helped augment my diet.So I have to advocate doing some exercise if you can. But make sure your focus is on diet and that you dont eat back your exercise calories. Something I adhere to is Diet is for weight loss exercise is for fitness,loseit,d0r78pe,2,t5_2rz8w

6854576,0,t3_49mjg7,NSVSV  Ok so this is a bit of a weird one.    Ive been weighing myself every couple of weeks but on my mothers scales because I didnt have my own. Anyway she started at a weight loss class and got weighed on the very accurate scales there turns out her scales at home were off. WAY OFF. She was a lot heavier than her scales were telling her. So this meant I was heavier too  I was gutted.         Not to be discouraged I bought myself a decent set of digital scales. They arrived yesterday and last night I took a very deep breath took the plunge and weighed myself. And would you believe it they are telling me I weigh exactly the same as I did on my mothers scales  weeks ago! I know over that time I must have lost enough weight for it to balance out but I really dont know how much. Yes it means I cant change my flair any time soon but Im happy that I know exactly where Im up to. I think this counts as a victory in my book!! ,loseit,d0t9vzo,6,t5_2rz8w

6856720,0,t3_49ofhm,I have had some interesting things happen in regards to jealous friends about my weight loss but a car wreck? DANG.Here is the thing in the beginning people will act up but over time it will get better. When we change things about ourselves for the better it forces others to change to whether they want to or not. That can be scary for them because they are like OMG juicyjooce looks great.. then they look inward at themselves. They do not like what they see so they do the most logically thing... lash out. I had this happen with a friend but you know what was strange. She was so jealous she started to try to one up me and now she runs marathons. She told me recently it was the best thing that I got fit because it forced her to look at her life.  This also happened with my parents too. Will this happen to everyone? No. Some people you may have to distance yourself from. I have some of these friends.

6858485,0,t1_d0tj3v6,Sounds like a good plan.  Its good that you have access to a few studios because Ive definitely discovered through my exploration that not all bar classes are the same.  Bar Method was actually the fourth time Id tried a bar class the first was at a gym the second was at a different gym and the second was Pure Bar and I never really loved it before I found the studio Im at now. Ive also tried it since at a yoga studio since I wanted to try to squeeze in a bar class when I was out of town and it was awful.  So I would say if that first studio doesnt feel like a fit it may be worth trying the other ones to see if they suit you better.I personally gravitated towards the one I chose because I like the individual attention and hands on corrections you get.  In the other classes I hadnt been getting that and I think it was a big part of why I didnt feel like it was working or see results.  At least at Bar Method a lot of the exercises we do involve creating your own resistance with your body and small precise movements so if your form is wrong you might not be getting the full benefit of the workout.  I think thats something worth noting about bar in general.  I found it took a little time to figure out what certain positions were supposed to look and feel like but once Id master that it was easy to get into a groove and really push myself.At the end of the day I think its all about figuring out what works for you.  I love bar classes and it was the first time I can remember enjoying working out this much and getting the results as well as the endorphin boost.  But Ive taken gfs with me and its not always for them.  Totally a personal thing.,loseit,d0tpv6j,2,t5_2rz8w

6859114,0,t1_d0tdn50,gt  you can eat them as long as you make sure youre burning more off than youre eating A word of advice especially when talking to people that are overweight dont say burning more off because it implies that exercise is critical to the process when it isnt and may discourage some.  A better tactic is to teach them about TDEE and advise that they stay under that and to not count or for sure eat back those calories.Personally I dont count exercise calories at all.  I lost a bunch of weight with no exercise I just didnt like the body that was emerging from the fat so I started exercising.  But I exercise to be stronger have more stamina and to look better.  I DO NOT exercise to lose weight at all the fact that exercise just happens to also burn calories is completely secondary to me.,loseit,d0tsfs4,2,t5_2rz8w

6874547,0,t1_d0vjbie,Hey man Im glad youre here   This is a great first step.I think you need to get started calorie tracking though  because I hate to be the bearer of bad news but unless youre eating too many calories there is no way for you to weigh  lbs.Your TDEE Total Daily Energy Expenditure is  kcal.  Note I used female when calculating the TDEE because its likely your fatlean ratio mirrors that of a biological female.  I do recognize that you are indeed a man but theres a decent chance that biologically your body hasnt realised that yet  Anyway what this means is that unless you eat  kcal per day you will lose weight.  If you eat  kcal per day you will lose a pound every week.  If you eat  kcal per day you will lose  lbs every week.So like I said the best way to keep on top of your calories like this is to track them using an app  like My Fitness Pal or Loseit.Best of luck  this sub reddit is a great resource   Youre in the right place!,loseit,d0vjk4q,2,t5_2rz8w

6879155,0,t3_49z4mr,One thing I have learned about losing weight is that it is your journey. Unfortunately that could mean a very lonely journey. It is really heard to get support from people on something they have never had to deal with. For example my friends and most of my family would laugh at me or even say cruel things when I started working out and they didnt really support me or motivate me. However my oldest brother who had finished his weight loss about  years before I started was and is the most supportive and understanding person when it comes to everything. I found out that its because he went through the struggles and pain that I am going through. So I recommend just staying strong and dont bother talking to people who show little to no interest about it. Sorry if that came of a little to harsh haha! Its all about surrounding yourself with people who do encourage and motivate you even if they are on a computer screen. Hope this helps a bit. TLDR  Some people cant sympathize give support or motivate you on your struggles and challenges because they have never had to deal with those struggles and challenges.

6890168,0,t1_d0x3gfo,That  calorie number already incorporates the other tissue. Its not  lb of pure fat which would contain  calories. The actual makeup of your weigh loss will vary slightly person to person but you shouldnt be outside of  or so variation from the  per pound number. At the extreme maybe  variation is possible. However if you started logging at the very beginning you will lose scale weight more quickly than projected at first as your water weight drops. This happens when your body adjusts to your new diet less food overall less sodium less carbs. Once this initial water weight adjustment is complete your weight loss rate should come in pretty close to projections. If you arent using a heart rate monitor to track your TDEE there is definitely some room for error in those estimates though so if your weight loss over a month or more is not tracking at the expected rate it might be worth revisiting your TDEE estimate.,loseit,d0xbgl8,2,t5_2rz8w

I know its not  lbs of fat so Im just going to be realllllly on top of things this week and hope for a woosh next week. So thats part  and a of my tantrum.Part  is this effing weather. Its been  and sunny all weekend so I got in some walks a run a long bike ride and yesterday I had every intention of going for a run but it was all grey and drizzly and windy and yeah I was physically capable of doing it but instead I stayed home and read my book. Today regardless of weather Im going for a run.Part  of this tantrum is Easter candy. My coworkers bring in more candy every day. It looks like the seasonal aisle of CVS up in here. Also they try to be nice and come directly to my desk with cookies like do you want one before I put them on the communal table? gahhh I know youre being nice but get outtttt. I do have a reputation of having a weird diet so people dont usually question my food choices they just assume I dont eat stuff so thats good I guess. Also my sister and I  and  years old respectively convinced our mom to have an Easter egg hunt for us because shes going to get us Easter candy so we may as well have to work for it and climb a tree for that cadbury egg or some shit.

Eventually the craving will go away or you will give in.  See how many minutes you made it.  If you gave in try to go for longer next time.  ,loseit,d10xr4q,1,t5_2rz8w
6922169,0,t3_4aj6np,I think the answer is second breakfast.I eat at am work out  eat again at  after I get home. Protein for sure but this is also a good time for carbs and dairy. Starve your lazy body but feed the working body.I eat two eggs and cereal with milk before workouts. I usually have more cereal after. On days that I work out I get about  of my calories before am.Also if you are working hard you probably want to credit at least some of the calories your burn off back to your diet. On Saturdays I do  minute snowboarding lessons which gives me an extra ish calories for that day. I dont eat them all back but I do eat a fairly massive breakfast after snowboarding Saturdays. Dont try to stick to the same calorie restrictions on days that you work out. Trust MFP or whatever you are using to help you count with the exercise too.,loseit,d10y9y0,1,t5_2rz8w
6923222,0,t1_d10s8nf,Couldnt agree with these tips more.  As for fitting in exercise I work  hour days and its about  minsan hour commute one way so rather similar hours to OP.  I try to plan my exercise around it.  For me I have the option to go in early so that I can get off a bit sooner and that helps with getting in some shorter  hr or less workouts during the week.  If Im training for something Ive been known to do a . hour workout after my workday but I try to leave the longer stuff for my days off.  Example  If my schedule says I need to run  days per week Ill plan the longest run for my first day off then another run on another day off...  Then I only have two days when I need to run during the week.  You can also split your routines...  Do Mossa in the morning then when you get home destress with a nice walk before makingeating dinner.  Another thing I cannot talk up enough  Meal planning and prepping!  If you utilize meal planning and prepping get everything chopped divided up and in some cases precooked during your days off you can really cut down on the time it takes to make dinner.  And then youre also in complete control of how many calories you eat because you did all of that before you were coming home tired and grumpy aka prone to poor decisions.  Its easy to get caught up in all the potential issues but if you look for the ways to make things work and youll generally find some.  ,loseit,d112kxc,1,t5_2rz8w

What this means is pick exercise that you enjoy so you feel motivated to go out there because they are things you want to do. Exercise is completely optional it will make you feel great but its the diet that will lose the weight for you. So remember even if you dont feel like going out you can still lose the weight with the right diet.With eating better focus on eating less first. Using my fitness pal track all your food intake and keep reducing it. One you have the right amount of food you should be losing weight. Now to take it one step further you can slowly sub items in your diet for healthier options or not  you can lose weight on burgers and fries.

If youre consistent with that youll lose a pound about every  weeks.

I used to be fairly active and work jobs where I could move around all day.  years ago I started a desk job my first one and I feel like its destroyed my body. Ive been trying to stay active to compensate I took up running a couple of years ago and managed to even run a half marathon last year yay. I was planning to run a full marathon this year and wanted to lose some weight to get my speed up and be a bit more fit. In Jan I lost a family member and things went kind of off the rails. I stalled in my training program and started stress eating a lot. Im getting married this summer as well contributing to stress eatingdrinking. It also turns out that we are going to be moving to a new city on the day I was supposed to run the full marathon. I put on all the weight I lost in training and then some. Ive decided that enough is enough. I want to learn to deal with my stuff in a healthy way and that includes losing this  lbs getting my stress eating under control and staying with a fitness plan.

7013364,0,t3_4bpn94,Wednesday was not so good. Im being hit with urges to overeatbinge again after a very long time without them. It is so scary. I cried in the shower. I cant live like this honest to god. I wont. I dont know what I need to do to make them stop though. Its not restricting calories because Im not eating at a deficit or just a small one most days. But. Im not eating any more. I think Im maybe  over TDEE but I was probably  under yesterday so it balanced out. Any more would be eating for the sake of eating. So. Not today Satan not today. My current plan going forwards is just to try to let go of deficit attempts and eat at  calories daily and not save them so much. Part of my trouble happens when I try to save calories to have pretend binges eating a larger amount of food at once. No. Its over. I have to stop.,loseit,d1bb9qc,3,t5_2rz8w

7028135,0,t3_4bw05m,I dont know if you are looking for ideas what to do or a new way of thinking?  But the way I think about staying slim or even just healthy is that I have to remember that when you live in a highly obeseogenic environment like most people in the US do staying slimhealthy is like swimming up a river.  If you let go and stop swimming against the river flow direction you go backwards.  The river is the environmentculture and its force toward obeseoverweightpromoting behaviors form an resistance to being slimhealthy.  That means you dont need to binge eg eat a big bag of cookies or whatever to neutralize weight loss you just need to have neutral culturally accepted behavior.  In order to lose weight you have to do things that are a lot different than what the people around you do.  They go out to dinner and you either have to refuse to go or go and just have water or something really minimal or have the restaurant make a lot of changes to your dish.  What I suggest doing is when you feel the urge to binge just remember this.  Go out to dinner and order the normal things other people order.  Or cook whatever you were going to cook but make it the more normalusual way without crazy weight lossfasting substitutions etc.  Do this for a couple days until you feel normal again then once you feel some relief from the pressure you can go back to your diet.  This way there may be less of a back tracking against your progress it also may avoid guilt from having actually binged.,loseit,d1czqj9,9,t5_2rz8w

So if you eat  calories over your TDEE every single day for a week or eat  calories over one day and stick to your TDEE the rest of the  days you will gain the same amount of weight.One pound is  calories.

Does everything get measured properly?  Are you sure youre not missing calories through drinks?  Have you had more salt lately?If you are indeed doing everything correctly and not missing anything out of those very common errors then it sounds like youve just reached a plateau.  Stick with it and itll break free soon.In the meantime this is an excellent time to focus on overall health and goals that are connected to your scale.  Are you taking measurements? Are your clothes fitting differently? Are the workouts going longer? Faster? Easier?  Are you feeling more active and fit overall?  Reaching any other goals?Our weight can fluctuate several pounds everyday based solely on water so while we lose fat its entirely probable that that fat loss is hidden by an equal amount of water.

7165188,0,t3_4dn46y,There are a few things you can do. Get into a routine with food so you know how many calories certain foods are and how it will fit into your budget.  Eat those same things every day and you dont have to be as meticulous with tracking them.  I for example have nearly the same thing for breakfast and lunch every day.  I rotate a few things once in a while for variety but generally stick to the same things.  I really dont even need to log those things anymore since they equal the same amount of calories every day.  If you go this route though make sure youre really staying accountable to the correct portions and sizes. Im not sure of your daily calorie goal but try to think of it as a budget instead of a rule or quota.  If you eat  instead of adding in things to hit  think of it as  budget.  Somedays youll only be at .  Somedays youll be at . Get distracted!  I get really obsessive about food and counting calories when losing weight.

The rloseit FAQ gt exercise machine calorie counters are correct or infact wrong?Theyre almost certainly wrong but the question is how wrong.  Some machines will ask you to input your weight.  Thats a key indicator that its making a more serious attempt at figuring calories because your weight is key in determining the caloric equivalent of the work.gt but  miles in  to be exact So youre running  miles per hour?    Nah.   gt most of the time Im at .I dont know what that meansgt Its roughly  calories per mile for a exercise bikeKeep in mind that these exercise machines actually travel zero miles.  Theyre all simulations and pretend to help encourage you.  Theyre useful in that you can compare your performance on that machine one session to another but you cant compare them on different machines and  in my experience  you cant trust them very well for calories.  Finally if you are food logging you have to know that your food budget already assumed some level of calorie expenditure that day.

Your answer may lie not in your willpower but in taking steps to improve your work and sleep. Im not sure what your options are but even if you cant quit right now perhaps try to figure out how you could shift your schedule in the future and then work towards that as a goal.Aside from the above I definitely feel you because I have sugar addiction problems myself. Instead of concentrating on eating LESS sugar maybe try concentrating on eating MORE protein and vegetables. Positively framed goals help avoid negative thinking and getting down on yourself or feeling like youre failing.

I have happy ones like a small scar across the bridge of my nose from when my sister and I were playing on a swing set and she FINALLY jumped off the swing like a Really Big Kid and the swing came back and caught me in the face. It hurt but I was so happy for her. Others are sad I have a small scar that came from someones ring when they hit me. We had been close but addiction can make people turn on their friends sometimes and do terrible things. I have just plain odd ones like the scar I got on my hand from a freak ice skating accident. I have ones stretch marks from growing and being pregnant. And i have ones that i am proud of like the surgical scar after a shoulder repair. It wasnt an interesting surgery but I had to work hard for months at physical therapy and that scar always reminds me of how proud I felt the first time I could lift my arm completely unassisted. I suppose if I had ambitions of being a supermodel my scars would be a bad thing.

7273196,0,t3_4exzco,I weigh every day but mostly just to stay in the habit. I do not take small fluctuations in weight seriously. Its always better to look at the average weight over time. Water weight can cause gains of  lbs over the course of one day. Do not get discouraged if you see youve gained a pound. I like the Lose It app because it shows you a graph over weight over time so you can see all the little daily spikes but it also helps you see the overall trend which is down.,loseit,d24wwii,1,t5_2rz8w
7280493,0,t1_d25nks8,Exactly the fiber forces your digestive system to process the sugar more slowly like an extended slow release. But sugary chocolate or sugary drinks are an immediate flood of sugar because they are quickly digested and released into your system. With fruit your pancreas can keep up with sugar bombs the insulin is too slow to properly process all of the sugar. You get sustainable energy over a longer period of time instead of a high and a crash.,loseit,d25qrzg,5,t5_2rz8w

7291450,0,t3_4f73dw,Not sure if youre actually in India or a desi in a Western country but I know the struggle bro. Im not doing low carb myself but a lot of vegetarian and nonvegetarian Indian food should be low carb shaaks sabzis dal etc.. As others in this thread have noted the high carb foods youre going to want to cut down on or flat out avoid are things like rotis naans rice samosas etc. If youre in India this is obviously easier said than done as youre probably surrounded by these foods everywhere you go. I live in the US so I only tend to have Indian food  times a week for dinner I stopped eating rice all together and only have  rotis per meal. In terms of tracking on MFP it can definitely be difficult. What I do is Google whatever Indian food I ate and search for typical calories and nutritional info for that item I average that out and look for something on MFP that comes close. Its obviously not an exact science but even estimating like this is better than nothing.,loseit,d26zlrn,1,t5_2rz8w

If I hadnt succumbed to a moment of cookie butter temptation I would have been under. But in the grand scheme of things this really is not bad at all for me for a Sunday dinner.

He eats  calories a day for  days but only gains  pounds.  His diet was all unprocessed foods with no added sugar  fish steak coconut oil nuts vegetables.   Same meals for  days  extra calories over his BMR and only  pounds gained.   He does the same  day challenge this time with carb loaded processed foods   calories a day for  days and he gains  pounds.    He goes back to eating maintenance calories of  a day for  days with unprocessed foods including bacon eggs cheese etc and loses  pounds in  days.Theres a lot of scientific studies to show why this would be the case but its primarily keeping blood sugar and insulin stable versus constantly spiking it with sugar.,loseit,d279m4d,-4,t5_2rz8w

You are at a normal weight sure you can lose a few and I do mean a few pounds and still be healthy but you in no way NEED to. Your dermatologist didnt say anything at all about your weight he just advised you to lay off the sugar a little that does not mean drop to less than  kcalories a day and punish yourself for eating a piece of chocolate. Please get help professional help your relationship with food is really worrying. You cannot be eating  kcal a day and hope to burn it off during workout.

7323980,0,t3_4fovrn,Did you read the FAQ? Make sure you read that twice.Eating healthy is always a good idea but whats more important for weight loss is eating fewer calories than you burn. Start tracking your intake then calculate your TDEE and figure out how much you need to reduce your calories to lose weight. When you dont have access to healthy food simply eat smaller portions of the unhealthy food. Fit it into your calorie budget.Also keep trying to new healthy food every once in a while. Your tastebuds do change over time so a vegetable you didnt care for as a kid might taste pretty good to you now.,loseit,d2aopqh,1,t5_2rz8w

Its harder to lose weight eating garbage so naturally youll start trying new things to substitute or cutting some bad things from your diet but armed with the knowledge of whats in it will guide you in that process.Once youve learned that you can learn about macronutrients and you may find that some things you thought were not healthy actually are and vice versa I noticed you described the pasta as healthy but Im guessing it ends up being a lot of carbs that you dont need unless youre very active,loseit,d2aoub9,1,t5_2rz8w

Its tough when its staring you in the face. I still live at home and my brother eats really unhealthily. Something that has helped me on the days that he brings home my favorite cookies from the Publix bakery or orders a pizza is this question If I was sitting here on the couch would I have wanted this food badly enough to get in my car drive to the store pick it up pay for it and drive back? Most of the time the real honest answer is no half because Im lazy and half because Im broke. And of course the whole disciplinedeating and trying to lose weight thing.  Once I realize that I know that I dont REALLY want it its just...there. Theres absolutely nothing special about it theres no special occasion it was just in the store and now its in my house. It doesnt mean I have to eat it. If I choose not to eat it today its not like I will never have the opportunity to eat it ever again. There will be another box of cookies just like it sitting on the counter in the Publix bakery tomorrow. And every day I just...make that choice not to eat them. I dont know if that makes any sense haha. Thats just kind of my thought process when Im staring temptation in the face.

Id always wondered why I could never get back down to my college weight despite hitting the gym with the same frequency and eating healthy.The reason I was working an office job and sitting in a chair for  hoursday vs. college when Id be constantly walking to from and between classes and parties. I was probably averaging k stepsday and generally on the move whereas with office life my only exercise was an hour at the gym and walking to grab lunch. Its really illuminatingmotivating when Fitbit tells you  of your day is sedentary.In retrospect its so obvious but preFitbit the answer was obscured by me thinking my exercise took place at the gym and since the major variables gym diet were the same Id been puzzled by the weight gain. The lack of walkingso much sitting never crossed my mind since walking doesnt seem like exercise. And yet it is.,loseit,d2fm9v4,1,t5_2rz8w

BMR  TDEE . So your TDEE should be close to mine and a little higher since youre younger. I dont think its a good idea to ever go under  unless youre medically supervised and a doctor tells you to do that because its hard to ensure you get all the necessary nutrients eating that little. Also it would be hard for you to eat anything empty calories at all all the calories would have to be top quality and all food super nutritious.

More importantly to answer your question yes you are an asshole for thinking like this. Someones weight says nothing about their kindness generosity compassion humility intelligence etc. You dont know what kind of things someone has gone through that makes them turn to food as their relief so you really have no right to judge. A lack of compassion for fat people is actually a logical fallacy. You assume that both you and the fat person had the same walked the same paths with the same circumstances and they made choices to be fat while you made healthier ones. In reality they had a completely different set of circumstances that lead to their choices. I hope you can find compassion within yourself.,loseit,d2huazp,15,t5_2rz8w

I lost about  pounds in the first  months of calorie counting basically the first  months after discovering this sub then I had to get my gallbladder removed because I lost the weight too rapidly. I basically yoyod for the next year after that because I would get really motivated lose  pounds then feel satisfied and stop tracking. This would lead me to gain it all back! This happened probably  times so I suppose I have lost an additional  pounds which is mildly infuriating to think about. I finally decided I had had enough of the yoyo life and I have lost almost  pounds since January. I feel great and its surreal to me that my goal weight is only  pounds away.

7452273,0,t3_4hcpwn,Hey. Ive been where you are. Ive had some mad crushes and always in the end would tear myself down about my appearance in the process whether or not it ended in rejection or just kinda faded out which were about the only two outcomes.Ive always been extremely awkward and not exactly the most delicate looking woman.  Never have been or ever will be petite. Im  feet tall and at my heaviest was around lbs. I felt like a linebacker. What guy would ever be interested in someone like me? I could never be picked up or twirled around playfully or make a guy feel manly because Im small and need protecting be carried or pull off short dresses and heels stuff that girls who physically were the opposite of me could do.Towards my later high school years I started getting into working out and eating right. Ive lost  lbs and managed to keep it off for  years now and learned a lot in the process. Im still learning every day. years ago I got into a relationship with a man who I if I would have known him during high school wouldve thought he was incredibly out of my league. He is an amazing man and I am incredibly happy to be in a relationship with him. Any insecurity I developed about my body that still lingered despite my weight loss is slowly eroding. I have giant hips like you. He jokes that theyre perfect for babies kinda weird but hey. Hes strong enough to pick me up and he makes me feel safe and feminine. Instead of hating things about me now my point of view has changed and these are all feelings I developed before my relationship which I think is the most important. Instead of hating my biggiant size  feet I learned to love them because without them I would lose my balance while working out or doing yoga. Instead of comparing myself to petite women I learned to love my nonpetite is there a better word for that besides large? body it became statuesque. Being tall became awesome because LEGS. Instead of avoiding weight lifting because of a fear of being tall AND muscly I learned how to love being strong and powerful and feel like a fucking bloodthirsty Viking queen riding through the gates of Valhalla on a fiery godly steed. Things like that. And because I learned to love my body for exactly what it was gave me the motivation to take care of it which in turn gave me the self confidence I needed to be secure in my relationship. Before you love someone else you must first love yourself. Your time will come. The road ahead will look treacherous and difficult and at times it will be but one day you will look back and wonder what all of the fuss was about. I bet you are gorgeous you just need to realize it yourself first and take it from there. ,loseit,d2p9yom,19,t5_2rz8w
7454856,0,t3_4hguin,First off. Try to only weigh one day preferably the same day a week if the scale is going to bother you with weight fluctuations. Second water weight can be up to ten pounds different. The reason you always weigh yourself on the same day is I always do Monday morning since Im usually not eating junk food and salt Sunday so it tends to be one of my lower days. But its mostly because the other days of the week I dont always eat the same. Saturdays would be a bad day for me because I tend to both workout increases water weight and go out Friday evenings so Saturday morning Im a bit heavier. Mostly though just start a graph or something and put your starting weight and current weight on their. Look at it and realize that you have actually lost weight. And are continuing to do it. Sometimes even when Ive lost weight I feel like I havent if I dont graph it do I have to see it.,loseit,d2pkivi,1,t5_2rz8w

With lower leptin levels and other imbalances that makes it very difficult to do. I think a major issue here is that they lost weight WAY TOO FAST.

7457426,0,t3_4higok,With keto youre going to burn through your glycogen stores in the early part of your new diet which results in a fast initial weight drop. It should slow down pretty soon and youll probably feel symptoms of the keto flu or low carb flu for a couplefew days as your body transitions into ketosis. If and when you come out of ketosis youll gain back a few pounds when you replenish your glycogen levels with carbs. These are normal parts of the process when you follow a ketogenic diet.,loseit,d2pv22m,1,t5_2rz8w
7458581,0,t3_4hihhy,Oh my goodness I empathize with you so much. I dont have hypothyroidism but I do have a chronic illness and all the pain and fatigue that goes along with it. And struggle with depression a fair bit too its hard to look at your future and know that you have a disease that isnt going away. This is my strategyI found a support group for my rare disease. It helps a lot to know that Im not the only one going through all this. Im closely  watching what I eat. I cant control a lot of things about my body but this is one that I definitely can. And as is  repeated here frequently you dont actually need to exercise to lose weight. You can do it with calorie restriction alone. I do what I can for exercise but I try not to push further than I can handle. Im learning right now where the edges of this are. I did quite a bit on Saturday pushed further than I should have apparently then was too painful to sleep much Saturday night and too painful and tired on Sunday to do anything. I barely made it from the sofa to the bathroom on Sunday. Sunday was supposed to be meal prep day so that kind of sucks.look up spoon theory if you arent familiar I allow myself to feel sad and scared and angry about all this stuff the support group is a great place to vent sometimes. I dont allow myself to be helpless or to give up. Yeah having a painful chronic and in my case  progressive illness sucks ass. In that regard I got dealt a shitty hand. Its not fair. But I still have a lot of choices left in regards to the way Im going to play the hand I was dealt. Losing the extra weight and being as fit and active and healthy as I can be is the choice Im making.,loseit,d2pzsgb,1,t5_2rz8w

7544936,0,t3_4inqp0,My best friend had bariatric surgery and had skin removal surgery almost a year later to the day. She had to have it done in two sets upper body and lower body.Now that seemed really fast and early to me at first but shes done a great job of keeping off the weight and the skin removal helped her to do that. She hated her body with all the excess skin even though she loved being thin and healthy. Getting the excess skin removed made her so much more confident and happy in her own skin and now shes really thriving and is doing a great job of keeping the weight off. She got her bariatric surgery in summer of  skin removal in  and now here she is in  doing better than ever. I will say that her recovery from the surgery was very rough. She stayed in hospital for a few days after the second one because after the first one her platelet count dropped pretty dangerously low and she almost waited too long to go back to the hospital. I think it all depends on the person and  if they can afford to do it and  how much the extra skin impacts them emotionally. If the extra skin makes you hate your body almost as much as being fat did then getting rid of it ASAP is probably the better option overall. ,loseit,d2ztm8l,2,t5_2rz8w

7566802,0,t3_4iyzfz,Ok so to maintain your current weight youd have to eat around kcalday. Eat more than that gain weight. Eat less lose weight.IGNORE any exercise you do. People always overestimate how many calories they use. Youre just gonna shoot yourself in the foot.So if you want to lose lbweek then just eat the kcalday. REMEMBER to tell MFP youre sedentary. Not lightly active not moderately active. I dont care how much exercise  you do.edit To lose  pound per day youd have to eat nothing  exercise worth  calories. Not gonna happen.,loseit,d32b4lo,4,t5_2rz8w

Once I got the courage up to share with more people that I had it Id be surprised by how many people too struggled and how many people saw me as outgoing and confident the opposite of how I saw myself.

7608792,0,t3_4jiqci,Yes. Usually its a negative motivator that gets people to lose weight a rock bottom that makes them sick of living in their tired hungry depressed body. So they decide to overcome instead and its a long road that they walk or run or lift etc to get there.Weight loss is a marathon not a sprint. You see it as a big change because you havent been watching them every day for the past howeverlongit took. You see before and after pics and look at the time it took them and think its fast but six months to a year or more is a long time when youre putting a number value on literally everything thats passing your lips. You just keep working hard every day improving a little bit more at a time.And if one sticks to that regimen of hard work and always keeping to their goals in the end it looks impossibly simple like they must have had extra help because how is that even possible?And there you go.,loseit,d372w9c,1,t5_2rz8w

Its tiresome to just wait for stuff to happen it really is.  We have people here with metabolic issues that mean they only lose about  lbs. per year ... and they work so hard to do it. I lost  lbs. in  days...   true story ... but about rds of that was in the first  days.  But heres the thing.   Lets say I stopped right there.  Id still be working to maintain that  lb. loss.   You dont just lose it and quit ... if you do then you gain it right back.   So dont worry that it takes however long it takes.  There is no merit in fast weight loss or temporary weight loss.

WO that before after its going to be really hard to see the difference though surely you have some clothed old pics or something?Like others have said surely you need a belt or something surely your old clothes must look ridiculous on you?I talk about this Phantom fat briefly on my new channel in this video.  ive got my before afters overlayed there which is about  lbs of weight loss youll see the difference it made on me.Take some before afters now then again when you get to your GW i bet youll be gobsmacked by the difference!Edit Just thought id add because i totally forgot to mention this i actually made sure i took before afters because i lost all the weight before and then put it all back on and i distinctly remember wishing i had before afters i actually put all the weight back on because i just failed to see myself changing can thank the brain for not popping up its own memory before afters and warning me there ,loseit,d39lilp,2,t5_2rz8w

Eating  would explain being down  pound but not being down  pounds.  But I suspect youre actually the next notch up  Between lightly active and active.   Both that AND your basal metabolism burns a little cooler than the formula  eitherboth ways it means that you should now move up to about  Calories a day and see if that stops your weight loss.  Maintenance also means that you have to eat because you exercise.  When you were losing eating back your exercise calories was optional.  Its not optional in maintenance.  So my suggestion  increase the size of your healthy meals and get your Calories up to around  a day.

7703367,0,t1_d3hri0f,gt What kind of workouts do you do that your weight flux is that high? Ive read in other threads that its from the muscles filling with somethingsomething to repair etc. but I dont think I experience this and now Im worried Im not working out hard enoughI think this is maybe one of those your mileage may vary things? I wrestled in high school in the s and I quickly learned about those  pounds that come and go. As far as I can tell its just water retentiongt Exercise physiologist Len Kravitz PhD of the University of New Mexico explains that the tearing of muscle tissue and the rupture of muscle cells initiates an inflammatory response which peaks  to  hours after exercise. As a part of this response the hormones ADH and aldosterone cause the kidneys to retain water. After a few days balance is restored and water weight is eliminated.Ive never heard of it making a huge difference in workout outcomes. And the longer Ive been training or the more weight that Ive lost in the past few months the less my weight fluctuates from daytoday. I cant imagine why  pounds of water retention would cause bigger gainz than  pound or why it would mean that I did a better workout. Instead I measure workout quality by how much the weight on the bar increases each week and how much faster my mile time gets not by how much I hurt or how much I inflate.  I measure weight loss by CICO and by multiweek trends.I think the most important thing is to internalize that progress is bumpy and it takes a long time and that stressing out how daily gains and losses in anything is a waste of emotional energy. Id love to pretend that Im calm about this stuff because Im mature and I manage my emotionsbut really Ive just gone up and down the emotional roller coaster enough times that I cant be bothered to stress out any more because its too exhausting.,loseit,d3htl2e,3,t5_2rz8w

It was fairly late at night and we were mostly empty but an older gentleman was making his way to the bathroom as I had just finished cleaning that area and was working on the area leading to it.  He stopped on his way and said something along the lines of thank you for doing what you do.  Its important.I was honestly just moved.  never before had I been thanked like that and never after was I thanked like that.  I told him that he was the only person to say something like that to me and that it genuinely meant something to me.

7770999,0,t3_4lr2xy,You dont have to exercise to lose weight if you check out the FAQ I believe it is still up there was some talk of it getting revamped all that really matters is calories in lt calories out. If you download MyFitnessPal and enter your stats you should see how much you should be eating to safely lose weight .lbweek should be a nice place to start. Then all you need to do is to accurately log what you eat and drink each day easier said than done. Though... if you are in highschool you can also get exercise via sports teams or if your school has a dance club. Its also a great way to meet people and fun and it looks good for collegejob applications.,loseit,d3pi0j4,6,t5_2rz8w

I definitely set myself smaller goals too because one giant goal  pounds away would be very disheartening and every little bit I lose seems like such a small part. But if I set myself goals every  pounds for example then the little things matter a lot.

If youve done it once you can do it again!As for the process itself take it one day at a time. Yes weight lossmaintenance needs to be a long term effort.

7863001,0,t3_4mzgpe,Here are a few tips how you can minimize cravings...These may or may not help for you depending on where you are in the processhow much restraint you have built already. It gets easier with time and practice.ampnbsp. Keep your trigger foods out of the house.    Everyone has some foods they just cant control themselves around. When youre just starting out those cant be in the house. If they are they need to be out of sight.. Eat and drink water before you go to the store.    Often when Im thirsty I want to buy everything with lemon flavor juicesoda ice cream or really any refreshing taste. I think Im craving the food but Im really thirsty. Drink a lot of water. Get the app Plant Nanny. Dont exclude any food  nothing should be forbidden.    When I tried to cut carbs all I ever wanted was carbs. When I tried to replace all my candy etc with carrot sticks all I wanted was the candy and I would binge at some point. Keep eating everything in moderation except your worst trigger foods.. Many of the cravings are actually habitual. Learn more about habits and the power of advertising.    A habit can work like this You always drive the same route home you see the fast food place and your mouth immediately waters and you start craving the fast food. Your cue just happened. You give in to the cue get the food eat it. This is your routine. Your brains reward center lights up like a christmas tree and you feel great for a while Reward and then the shame and regret. This can be unlearned and avoided by for example driving a different route or replacing the routine with something else that gives the same reward. Great book about it here. Exposure therapy. Gradually learn to handle the trigger foods.    I did this by eating  small piece of the same type of chocolate every day for  months not treating it as bad food or morally wrong food just as calories like everything else. Also if I wanted to eat something Id have a little of it. In time this started to stick and I got better and better at having trigger foods in the house without eating them or eating just  calories worth. It can be done. It takes time and practice. . Willpowerrestraint is a finite resource.    If you have already resisted     situations during the day where someone offers you a cookie you say no you pass fast food or candy in the store and you dont cave etc... Understand that your willpower will weaken and you are more likely to eat something in the evening. Prepare for this by having lots of healthy snacks handy.ampnbspgtHow do you deal with insane cravings when you have them?I eat whatever it is Im craving but only  calories worth.

Because its hormones made to trick your body into thinking its pregnant you might have some cravings or some water weight but it shouldnt be a ton  if it is talk with your dr about switching types of bc there are a ton of options. localized options like the ring or hormonal iuds also have lower side effects for some people so might be worth a chat with your dr if you have side effects from pillspatches and nonhormonal iuds are also a thing! If the pill makes you miserable you have other bc options. ,loseit,d40wx76,1,t5_2rz8w

It was as simple as that no goal in mind other than shaving time off my walk so I could get on with my day. Also the elevated calorie burn is great. Im short and not very heavy so I can eat a little more if Im boosting my weekly deficit with xcals burned from exercise. I tried CK once it it drove me crazy I have no time for all that startstop crap. I used to run before so my body readapted pretty quickly. I use the MapMyWalk app to track my distance pace split pace and calories burned. It syncs to my MFP account too which helps me keep a complete picture of my diet and exercise. Open app hit Start Workout play Spotify and go.At the moment Im averaging   minutes per km down from over mins. The progress is slow but tangible.

All of my previous weight loss attempts ultimately failed when I grew exhausted with the idea of logging every calorie and weighing every ingredient.  I know intuitive eating is an oftcriticized concept around here but it was as you say fixing my relationship with my body and food in general was the key to longterm sustainable success.  Im sure you know how hard it is to push towards those last couple pounds lost especially as a fellow powerlifter when the protein requirements remain high and you want to subsist on sources other than chicken breast tilapia and greek yogurt.  I might have a sixpack at  pounds but I find it much easier to maintain a bit higher at  and even seem to have more energy and strength overall in that range.,loseit,d42btk9,4,t5_2rz8w

Chances are your relationship is going to end up on the rocks.Years from now you might resent him for it.If you have a parentchild relationship your sex life will go down the drain too because most of us have a built in aversion to that in a parentchild relation. So you wont enjoy it when you both arent equal.It sounds like youre the stronger and more independent person and that youre suppressing yourself for him. Dont do it. You are going to regret it so much down the line.Hes being a child now and you are enabling him.Stop enabling him.Stop mothering him.Take care of yourself first and foremost and let him do whatever it is he does. You can never control him anyway if hes dead set on having an unhealthy eating regime it will only frustrate you when he destroys your best efforts by eating candy etc and it will stop him from growing as a human being.

7945357,0,t1_d493lga,Being female in society isnt any better than being male. As kindly as I can say this dont blame your lack of luck with dating on being male.Each gender has their own struggles. We women deal with being treated like pieces of meat and blamed for our own rape. Damned if we fuck a guy damned if we dont you know? Maybe a guy is being sincerely nice... maybe hes trying to get us to sleep with him... maybe hes trying to find a chance to spike our drink and rape us. We have no way of knowing. Try to consider this when it comes to women being reticent and reluctant to get too friendly. Speaking from experience... dont think too hard about it being dating. My boyfriend tried dating me in the past but I ended things both times because I felt cornered into dating and everything that seemed to entail. It put a shitload of expectations on me that I didnt want. I felt trapped and I backed out. I refused to date men who made me feel trapped as though they expected something from me. It was only when I was given space to move freely and at my own pace that I considered the idea of dating him. The ongoing joke is that everyone else figured out we were dating before we did. I dont know you in person so I dont know how youre coming across to people. Im sure that youre a really wonderful sincerely kind person. Some women are fucking shallow. Some women are super shy and may not know how to respond or if they SHOULD respond Im one of them. Some women also like me find it difficult to tell if youre being platonically friendly or trying to hit on them  and the latter might scare us off. Some might not have anything in common with you. Some might not wanna date. None of these things are reflections on you as a person.For now focus on meeting people you have things in common with. Almost all of my good friends were people I met online through online groups and almost purely by chance my SISTER is the one who befriended them first. Maybe check out OKC or if youre the kinky type FL to see if theres anyone in your area who say might enjoy talking about video games or comic books or fitness or whatever else youre interested in.

8017599,0,t3_4p133f,Im  and started at ish Im down to  and working towards  with a goal of strength training. Ill share any tips that i can think of and feel free to PM me! Its been a life changing experience.Upper body is going to much easier and less painful to strength train. Lower body tends to get abused at our joints so things like Squats and highimpact movements can hurt and make you less likely to continue with that exercise.Bodyweight exercises are fantastic to start out with. Theyre lower impact and some of them can be downright brutal but effective planks medicine ball crunches yoga ball. I recommend you focus on core strength. The workouts will strengthen all supporting muscles including arms and legs.I couldnt do barbel squats comfortably because of joint pain but I could bench and use dumbells. I enjoyed a mix of cardio and anaerobic exercises for my gym routine. stationary bike  minuteswarm up stretch core  minutes bike weights  minute bike more weights etc. It keeps your heart pumping and proved to be extremely effective for me. I also personally do not like exercisemachines and avoided them.I do have a personal trainer. Its best to have a good routine than aimlessly going from machine to machine. Workouts will never be as effective.I was going through a really bad time when I finally managed to take control of my eating habits. I cut my meals in half or more. Basically i focused on CICO but I never actively tracked numbers. For me it was less what I was eating and more how much of it I ate. Its not that I recommend it but it worked for me. After  weeks of being hungry because of the reduction in food size my stomach started shrinking and became adjusted to the amount of food I ate. Its important that you avoid calorie dense foods and foods that dont satiate. I could eat half a large pizza in the blink of an eye cause if never left me full. Drinking LOTS of water or any nonsugarynondiet beverage before and during meals helps you from overeating.You can do diets like Keto etc but theyre often difficult to stick to. Growing up my family and myself did Atkins and a few others but they never worked because of how much you restrict yourself. I didnt have the discipline to not eat carbs and pretty much hated it. I absolutely hate the buzzword but lifestyle change is the prime goal. I ate less and tried to eat healthier but I didnt sweat it when I went out once in a while and grabbed beers and a plate of nachos with my friends. I also wouldnt starve myself to make up for it. Keeping yourself mentally happy is HUGE. I have honestly continued to eat like crap during my entire weight loss I need to work on my blood pressure but I lost because I ate less and had an overall caloric deficit. Right now I am starting to experiment with a Paleo diet while I start strength training. Keto I think is an extension of Paleo right? Well I am not giving up my chips and salsa but Im happy to try and eat less of it!The most important thing is that you find something that works for you. I do not work out like everyone else and I kept a mental notepad of my eating. It worked for me. The minimum is that you get out be active and eat better!Good luck!,loseit,d4h93oc,1,t5_2rz8w

8048427,0,t1_d4kpme3,I agree. I will say I know there is a focus on making sure portion sizes are accurate as published nutritional data only applies to what the standard portion should be. Mind you that at most restaurants sitdown fast casual fast food etc. your food is likely being made by someone working for minimum wage with little concern to portion sizes especially as it relates to nutritional value. Anywhere you go  that little bit of extra sauce they put on your sandwich that heaping scoop of rice vs. level scoop that .oz of cheese instead of oz...it all affects the published nutritional values significantly. Trying to make the items themselves healthier is one thing trying to prepare the items as they are supposed to be from a nutritional stance is another beast entirely.EDIT Forgot to mention that when you get something togo that is normally served dine in your portion size could be completely off.

8083223,0,t3_4pxlh0,First. Congratulations on the tremendous courage you have shown in making changes and asking for help from others. That shows wonderful humility and openness. You are awesome exactly as you are. Losing weight will not make you more valuable or more good than you are right now. It will simply be an outward manifestation of the changes happening inside. You cannot change your mothers behavior but you can choose how it will affect you.gt Choose not to be harmed and you wont feel harmed. Dont feel harmed and you havent been. gt  Marcus Aurelius MeditationsYour mother is suffering because she has such strong aversion that it is expressed as grasping. Sometimes love can feel like hate without emotional awareness. She wants want is good for you but does not know how to help you achieve that. She is suffering in different ways than you but she is still suffering.gt The key is to let go of two things grasping and aversion. Grasping is when the mind desperately holds on to something and refuses to let it go. Aversion is when the mind desperately keeps something away and refuses to let it come. These two qualities are flip sides of each other. Grasping and aversion together account for a huge percentage of the suffering we experience perhaps  percent maybe even  percent. gt  ChadeMeng Tan Search Inside Yourself The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success HappinessYou do not need to give your mother the power to upset you or derail your progress.gt Men are disturbed not by things but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things. Death for instance is not terrible else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death that it is terrible. When therefore we are hindered or disturbed or grieved let us never attribute it to others but to ourselves that is to our own principles. An uninstructed person will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone just starting instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who is perfectly instructed will place blame neither on others nor on himself.gt Epictetus The EnchiridionCalories in calories out is a good start.

Otherwise there are plenty of watchstyle fitness bands with HRMs built in Fitbit Jawbone Misfit Apple watch etc that would work too.IMHO as a data junkie its worth it to have the heart rate info.

A lot of what youre concerned about while I dont think you need to be is really just your distribution of fat which cant be addressed by any toning exercises since you cant spot reduce. However if you are worried about your quad development the bulge in the tops of your thighs I would recommend steadystate high intensity walking for cardio  minutes per session.

8118552,0,t3_4qf5nh,Ive lost lbs in the past and gained it back. This time I closely analyzed my reasons for stopping. I got a job and didnt have time to go to the gym The gym was far away. CICO is how to lose weight but doing cardio and weights was what kept me on the train. It kept my mind thinking clearly and helped me not indulge or forget about my CICO. Its a discipline thing for me plus it was motivating to see the performance results. So this time I removed the gym completely and just started running in my neighborhood doing organized Ks and bought some weights. Now I have no excuse to quit and I found that I enjoy  running outside a lot. A heck of a lot more than running on a treadmill anyway.

Again not sure what goal weight you have so grains of salt with these words. Instead of avoiding life take a slower route to learn to navigate social encounters. Suggest places without alcohol. If you get a meal plan to only eat half or get something a la carte to keep portions smaller. It will be more difficult at first but as you learn the places you go to eat and practice different meals or even different places to eat that can make it easier. ,loseit,d4tbi0h,1,t5_2rz8w

8151261,0,t3_4qvxj7, calories per gram is for the ethanol in the drink not the full liquor itself. If you drink  grams of  proof vodka those  grams of ethanol are always  calories. The rest of the drink is also coming out of normally fruit or grains and adds some extra sugar or calories on top usually. Thats the calorie variation in the drink and why vodka is less calories than whisky.If youre drinking  ounces of vodka theres no chance for . L of water to touch that dehydration. Conventional wisdom on the matter says you need about  liters of water just to counter act that much alcohol. Thats why youre waking up feeling lighter. You drink so frequently that your off days might feel bloated because youre finally seeing status quo and the effects of all that alcohol.Another important implication of alcohol on dieting is in how the body processes alcohol. Alcohol causes a strong rise in insulin levels which pushes available sugars and energy in your body into fat storage deposits. This is one reason why many people get hungry when drinking as their blood sugar can drop. This storage makes fat in your blood out of energy youd otherwise have available to use. The reason alcoholics get fatty liver problems is because the liver is the first place on the list for this storage swelling your liver with fat over time. Your liver is meant to be the first place your body goes to for energy and it will inflate like a balloon with fat over time till it gets too sick to function.Best of luck on your health. Im sure you understand the implications of your choices.,loseit,d4wgefv,7,t5_2rz8w

8166322,0,t1_d4yakqt,Entire industries are built around ensuring that weight loss is unsuccessful amp unsustainable not to mention ones built to literally keep you overfed. Proper diet amp nutritional education is theoretically accessible but practically it takes people years and years and sometimes they still dont know whats right and whats wrong. Food deserts exist. Culture amp families amp social pressure encourage amp support bad eating habits. Often these groups ostracize or threaten to ostracize you if you try to change that. Seeking out alternative supports is crucial so you can establish amp maintain new habits. I vehemently disagree with the idea that weight loss is exclusively about selfcontrol. That idea remains blind to the reality of the various systems  industries that are working in opposition to these goals and their impacts on a persons decisions. And it remains blind to the reality that change requires social supports. Selfcontrol as a concept is meaningless without social supports backing up the decisions. Almost universally we achieve selfcontrol because our social groups encourage it amp reward it. People who defy that are extraordinary but thats not the average person. Especially if that person has an issue with impulsivity which Im sure so many of us here do. All this to say its not one persons fault that they have a an eating disorder or b have become obese. But it is within their power to find the resources amp supports necessary to become healthier less heavy what have you. Removing the feeling of guilt amp fault does not strip people of their power to change. It just recognizes that we are people living in a food culture that is at worst banking on our failure and our fatness and at best entirely wrong at achieving its goals of keeping us wellfed. ,loseit,d4yc8e0,13,t5_2rz8w

The  arm rests felt snug and the seat narrow oh well.  At some point the camera pans our section of seats and were on the ginormous Citizens Bank Park screen. I saw a really fat person who had to fold ? hisher arms on their belly to keep from spilling onto their neighbors.

Cardio fitness is a pretty methodical painful game however the good news is if you are a fitness newbie you will notice if you consistently push yourself and give yourself proper rest that you will gain a lot of cardio fitness in a relatively short amount of time.Oh yeah make sure you have a balanced diet including having carbs do not cut out anything other than maybe excess sugar.Also you may want to look into caffeine pills.  They are cheap and they work but make sure you dont take too much at once.  Take one pill  minutes before your workout.

8250606,0,t3_4sewsh,Youre definitely not alone. Lots of people have these same problems.For me the part where youre feeling tired and crappy by lunch is the primary symptom of whats probably causing the majority of your problem. The secondary symptom is you do really well for a week then revert.Youre not getting enough calories. It sounds counterintuitive but you really have to understand what your brain is doing and why its doing it.Imagine youre taking your car on an  hour drive. First thing you do? Fill up. Why? Because your car will die if you dont. So you fill up. Youre driving. Youre driving. Your gas gauge inches down and youre fine with it. Youre burning gas but youve still got plenty left in reserves. The gauge keeps inching down and it dips below half. Youre still fine with that but you make note of it. It dips down to  of a tank. You start keeping an eye out for an exit but youre still mostly fine. Maybe a twinge of panic.When the gauge hits  of a tank and there still hasnt been an exit with gas you start to panic a little. The panic intensifies with each millimeter the gauge dips. If the gauge hits the E youre full on freaking out because your car is going to die. No gas no life. All other thoughts in your head cease to exist. Youre thinking only about gas until you fill the tank up again.The same brain that causes you to panic over gasoline does the exact same thing when youre burning a ton of calories without refueling except it cares more about your life than it does your car. If your brain is panicking about your survival its fucking crispy crme time and in the same way you cant hold your breath to kill yourself your brain will force you to eat and its got a crystal clear memory of the types of food it can break you with  foods with high amounts of efficient energy that are easy to obtain and consume. This isnt about will power. That shit is a myth if your brain thinks on your way to dying. Theres no such thing as will power when survival is at stake.It will manipulate you to do it if it has to. Every decision you make thats food related will take you through a labyrinth of shitty choices that leads you to the shittiest choice. Every single time. Cheat meals you werent planning on having suddenly become the reward for doing a few crunches or doing a couple jumping jacks. Break your own rule once and thats the opening it will use to cause the deluge. The cheat meal becomes a cheat day because you might as well right? Cheat days run into cheat weeks because fuck it youll make it up on the scale next week. Hell you might even lose even more weight and feel great about it next week.This all stems from you pissing your brain off. From the symptoms youre giving us I can almost guarantee that you dont increase your calorie intake on the days youre working out. With your age weight and height your body  should be burning somewhere around  calories per day just to maintain itself. Thats not including any daily activity or exercise. calories a day is not enough especially on workout days. Personal trainers  most of them anyway  tend to beat the fuck out of you. If they dont then why pay them? Its their business model. Thats probably adding  calories on top of your normal burn. Thats a large meals worth of calories and your brain is pretty good at math. It knows you cant sustain that and live. Youre feeling shitty by lunch because youre teetering on the line between cheating and not cheating. Your brain is trying to conserve energy because youre constantly telling it that you cant eat enough to sustain your activity level. Its making your body run like shit because thats the most efficient way for it to save energy.Youre pissing your brain off. Weight loss that is sustainable is about nothing more than chipping away at your energy reserves fat without your brain noticing too much. Give it just enough food that its not panicking and looking for exits because youre never going to get to the weight you want if your brain decides youre dying in the first weeks or months. You literally cant do it.Eat more food. That  might be okay on rest days but you need something like  at least on the workout days.TLDR Your day is like a road trip for your body and youre going through the whole thing on  a tank of gas every day your brain is freaking the fuck out because of it.P.S. Its not like youre  pounds. Youre . Thats actually around the average weight for women in the US at the moment. Plenty of average women getting married. Most men dont care what you look like. The ones that do arent usually very good ones. Good men are usually attracted to fun strong and loving personalities  motherly types. Youll find one if you stop feeling sorry for yourself do fun things and go socialize more. Cant fish without a river or whatever. ,loseit,d58vrg6,1,t5_2rz8w

All you need to do is figure out how many calories a person of your size eats to maintain stable weight eat fewer than that and you will absolutely lose weight.  No starvation mode myth no fancy high thermic value foods it makes . difference no exercise your walking will be enough simply eat fewer calories than your body burns and it will burn fat instead.,loseit,d5bwa0q,2,t5_2rz8w
8274954,0,t1_d5bvz8u,Youre misunderstanding me though I doubt that we actually disagree. A person with dozens of lbs to lose is likely running a  calorie surplus. They have a problem with food that needs to get fixed. Adding  calories of burn doesnt produce any weight loss if its just reducing the surplus.And thats assuming that you arent following the  calorie burn with a  calorie snack.Exercise does not help people who do not also control their diet.If you already have your diet under control like OP then you can add exercise and reap benefits pertaining to weight loss. To your point this is true even when you have a lot of weight to lose.And of course exercise has other health benefits not related to weight loss. I am not trying to say that these benefits dont exist.,loseit,d5bxev2,13,t5_2rz8w

This obviously comes into play with food eating too much and whatever I want and exercise not working out unless I feel like it but permeates my entire life.  I routinely ignore alarms and reminders I will tell myself to keep my mouth shut and yet talk anyway I interrupt people even though I am constantly reminding myself to listen and keep my mouth shut I buy things I dont need and know I shouldnt buy.  Im  and I feel like I have the self control of a teenager.  There are teenagers who are more disciplined than me.  I rationally know it is not true but Ive learned that I mentally have this very skewed impression of time where I seem to have this belief that I will get a doover.  I know its not true but Ive caught myself thinking about what I will do when I go back to school note I have no plans to pursue further formal education I have a grad degree and work full time.  Its insane but it kind of explains why I dont always take my behavior very seriously because some part of my brain thinks it wont count since Ill just do it over anyway.  While I very badly want to be attractive and always have I am terrified of positive attention.  When I was a teenager I got to a healthy weight and was conventionally attractive for a couple years but the only positive attention I got was from creepy older guys or random strangers and it felt more like harassment than flattery.  I am terrified of attention positive or negative about my appearance.  And yet I dream of being pretty just so I can have those  nice family photos and whatnot.  Whenever I have weighed less and started being treated more nicely it has made me really uncomfortable and brought out a lot of my social anxiety and just a sense of panic.  I need to face this and work on it though.,loseit,d5c033r,3,t5_2rz8w

8276778,0,t3_4srd1f, I was a horrible person in my teens and early s. Incredibly self centered which was weird because I was also very depressed. I hurt a lot of people I really cared about in the process to calm my own insecurities. Insecurities that were largely a part of my weight. I am so much different now and though Ive tried to apologize to many of those Ive hurt there are many I cannot find or do not want to speak to me. I still suffer from insane anxiety but am better at not taking out on people as much.   Previously while dieting I would sometimes mess up and make myself puke. Mostly while drunk not very attractive.   I get really jealous when I see others on FBetc who are far more conventionally attractive than me and far more successfulhaving kidswhatever I feel like Im doing worse at. I acknowledge Im this way and Im not usually a jealous person aside from this I get its just highlights from their life and I want to be happy for them instead of jealous so I stay far away from social media  of the time.

8287177,0,t1_d5deqxn,I learned how to be stylish. I didnt have a clue what to wear what suited me. A lot of it is trial and error plus getting tips from family and friends and reading fashion magazines and watching tv shows that tell you how to dress for your shape. My mother always said opt for quality clothes wise. Go for natural materials if you can...cotton linen etc. Theyre always more flattering on than manmade fabrics plus more breathable. Get clothes that look expensive..dont get anything tacky like hoopy earrings. Basically opt for a refined tailored look. Jennifer Aniston has some nice clothes plus French women. That kind of elegant look basically. Wear natural looking makeup. Shop in the winter sales for big purchases like coats designer jeans shoes etc. You can go to department stores and get really expensive stuff halfprice in the sales..you just have to keep an eye out. Ive had a few stylish friends that have given me tips as well. You say that you work in software development and I assume thats maledominated so maybe thats the issue here..that you havent had a chance to ask other women for fashion tips. If you ask a female friend for tips then a lot will oblige and say oh I pair this with that or whatever. I also asked girls that work at makeup counters for tips and hairdressers. I had a really honest hairdresser who just told me flat out that I wouldnt suit being blonde. I was just like ok cool..but I do know that some hairdressers are very pushy and try to sell you hair products the whole time. Certainly I felt pressurised to straighten my hair by hairdressers..theyd always be like oh your hair looks great straight but I was just like oh whatever and lo and behold wavy hair is now in fashion so I got the last laugh there. Bobbi Brown and Laura Mercier do great makeup lines. Laura Mercier is all about enhancing your natural beauty so her line has very muted colours.

Im a relatively young guy with lots of free time. My intention is to run a  calorie deficit from my TDEE calculated on the basis of a sedentary lifestyle. According to MFP that means I need limit my caloric intake to . From experience I struggle eating so little. As I dont tend to experience increased hunger after exercise I have been exercising in order to give me a few extra hundred calories per day.My typical regime is two hours of stationary bike on days when I dont lift weights and one hour of stationary bike on days when I do lift weights.Even though my cycling sessions are moderate intensity Avg HR of   MAXHR I input my cycling as light on MFP in order to curb any overestimations of caloric loss. According to MFP Im getting an extra  calories per  minute session bringing my daily caloric allowance up to  which I find much much more manageable. This is increased further on days where I do a second  minute cycling session.I would say that my focus on exercise isnt to lose weight.

I think the general consensus is lbsweek is the max you want to be losing with it still being healthy and sustainable and that way you wont get negative effects from losing weight too fast like increasing loose skin chances and something like gallstones I think it was? Someone will correct me if Im wrong!.To figure out your deficit and stuff just go to the FAQ and it will give you a calculator to figure out your TDEE and then how many calories you should be eating to lose weight. So my TDEE started at about kcal I think and I cut down to kcal  this gave me a deficit of kcal which let me lose about lbsweek.  ,loseit,d5eeqfl,2,t5_2rz8w

8324913,0,t3_4tlarm,Its possible that your losing too fast.  Wed need to know your stats to give a specific answer but broadly speaking here a few things to consider As a general rule of thumb lbs per week is an easy guideline of a safe weight loss pace.  However losing up to  of your body weight per week is the more accurate guideline it just requires a bit of math to calculate.  The biggest thing to consider here is your calorie deficit.  It should be no more than  calories and your calorie budget should be no less than  female or  male in general.  If your following that there is probably no reason to be concerned enjoy it while it lasts. Are you really losing  pounds per week or is it  pounds some weeks?  Minor wording difference but big reality difference.  If that number is an average over a period of time  months or more then you should probably dig in a bit and check your maths on deficit etc.  If its some weeks and you have others than bring the rolling average in line then dont worry about it at all.  The average is what really matters here.  Strange things happen with water weight that can make the scale do weird things at times so the drop any given week is irrelevant on its own.In summary   pounds per week sounds high but impossible to tell without more details,loseit,d5i63it,2,t5_2rz8w

Just dial in your calories so youre losing  pounds per week and stick with it plan on staying with your deficit for at least a year. The other thing is to not get worked up about occasional slip ups or times like vacations where you stagnate or gain a bit. Like I said above youre already planning on at least a year so whats another  days added because of a party or  weeks because of a vacation etc. Youre in it for the long haul and as long as you trend downward youll get there.,loseit,d5iax9w,3,t5_2rz8w

I am still struggling though with eating  calories in an hour or so in private hiding it from friends and family... Classic binging basically. I really dont know how to go about finding a professional for this and I kind of feel like its a waste. Im aware its a serious problem but I feel like I should be able to get over it on my own. Ive been doing well since I stopped putting restrictions on my eating and have just focused on eating healthy to sustain me... It just goes out of balance when I work out too much. I want to stress that I dont do things like marathons nor biking long distances for weight loss in any way.,loseit,d5j5vt7,1,t5_2rz8w

What makes it fun for me is not being Class II Obese any more.  Yes sometimes its shitty but you just have to power through the shittiness Ive been gaining and losing the last  pounds for about two weeks now.

8357591,0,t3_4u2hr1,My biggest issue with food is late night snackingbinging. I go through breakfast and lunch masterfully measuring portions and logging calories. Usually Im vigilant about making a healthy dinner though Ive noticed a bad tendency to take a largerthanhealthy portion size but then in the evening usually around  or ...I just fall off the rails. I try to justify it in my brain thinking oh i have  calories left for the day or whatever it might be and then I grab some oreos or pie or leftovers and proceed to eat without logging or even regarding calories or portion size. Any advice? I get that I could keep healthier snacks around and not buy the unhealthy ones sorry boyfriend! but that wouldnt keep me from eating leftovers or just plain TOO MUCH of whatever it is Im eating. I feel so stupid because Im basically just saying hi i have no selfcontrol but I just make all these rationalizations for what I eat at night and in the moment it makes sense.

8360867,0,t1_d5mlkyp,Polar specializes in heart rate monitoring which is whats important to me. Its more accurate for that syncs with chest strap heart rate monitor which also means it tracks workout calories accurately. Its a pain in the ass to sync with other things. To get my data into MFP I have to go through MapMyRun. I think this is easier with an apple device. I also think the step tracking is not as accurate as FitBit either.Ive had it about a year and its starting to get a little wonky complains about needing new charger battery life is worse. This week it has been uncooperative about syncing with the heart rate monitor. It also uses a non standard charging cable which is stupid.

Aside from it hurting me I feel so rejected and unloved. I can barely look at him right now. You know what those people said to you says more about them than it does you. Keep up the good work.

8467499,0,t3_4vkjig,Over the years Ive lost and regained a lot of weight.  Sometimes it was just  lbs for those times I hadnt really gotten going yet but at least twice it was heartbreaking because Id lost SO MUCH... if Id just kept going... or at the very least stayed still...Anyway.  Ive now lost more weight than I ever have in the past.  And I think part of the reason Ive been successful this time around is realizing that it is very easy for me to fall back on old habits.However  all these forays into weight loss in the past have taught me a LOT.  Basically when I decided alright time to get this shit started I didnt really have a lot of research I NEEDED to do.  I knew to start tracking all my calories and I even knew this subreddit existed.  I subscribed to it when I signed up and it took me  months to ever spend much time in itThat said Im doing a couple of things differently this time around.  I have daily goals and I know if I achieve the daily goals my huge goals that seem unattainable happen and  Im not allowing myself to cheat for BS reasons.I also have a more realistic plan for maintenance this time than I ever think I did.

I know that sounds stupid after just reading my comment about Sundays run sucking but thats an example of focusing on the wrong thing and getting yourself in trouble.There are some studies that have been done on Olympic rowers that show exercise is high heat and high humidity has similar effects as training at high altitudes.  If you can keep moving and keep with the training even at a slower pace when the heat and humidity breaks youll see really drastic improvement.We had a terrible hot stretch at the middle of June and I was really struggling to even finish some of my runs.  I thought I was back tracking and fatigued but when that  week snap of  degree temps broke my paces improved by about  seconds per mile.

I get what you are saying about food abundance but I dont think its right to buy ingredients on purpose to end up in the trash. This surplus of food production comes at a cost for the environment and the quality of our food and bad habits only reinforces this. Theres no need to encourage even bigger food production only so they end up in the trash food waste is already a big problem as it is. Sometimes we cant eat anymore and we shouldnt force ourselves to finish but then again there are different ways to deal with this  save the rest for later and learn to portion better for the future.Its up to us to change habits for ourselves eat better and in less quantity and for society produce less but more qualitatively. Our demand needs to change for producers to incorporate this. I do agree with you that baking and cooking can be more fun than eating but there are so many alternative ways to deal with the products portion it and freeze it bake smaller quantities sharing donate. Besides OP mentions family recipes these hardly exist for the sole purpose of culinary artistry they are usually meant  to be shared and enjoyed.

8492010,0,t3_4w0ngc,What are you considering metabolic slow down?  The basic you weigh less so you need fewer calories or the youve lost weight and your metabolism is slower than other people just like you?The first is just going to happen.  Theres less mass and therefore you need fewer calories.The second?  Not really a thing.  Theres some variation but not enough to be significant.Now as far as the NYT article is concerned that is a really bad example.  The article and study both have major issues.  The participants crash dieted to an extreme.  They were given no support system upon completion of the show and were left with no knowledge of how to handle their new bodies.  They generally returned home either expecting to return to life as normal overeating and sedentary or having to continue to crash diet and kill themselves in the gym.  Neither of which are a recipe to maintain a sustainable new weight.  It was actually ideal for the show to have them regain weight as they do not pay off the winner if they do not maintain within a percentage.  These people returned home to celebrity and celebration.Once they began to overeat against their new TDEEs the fat packed on quickly as they no longer had the lean mass they were accustomed to having at their previously high weight.  Muscle loss?  Yes due to the extremes of their diet and exercise regimen they lost significant lean mass along with the fat. Now... due to the extreme muscle loss and the suddenly reemerging body fat their metabolism IS significantly lower than someone else their size.  Why?  Your metabolism is dependent on lean mass in addition to other biological mechanics.  That other guy thats   pounds has a lifetime of muscle mass built under the fat from needing to move the excessive weight while the TBL contestant does not.  Their body fat percentage is seriously skewed in comparison to the other.If you manage to lose significant weight you can not return to life as it was before and this is where nearly all weight loss fails.  People look at goal weight as the finish line and it simply isnt true.Ive lost over  pounds since February of last year.  At my heaviest I needed literally  calories a day to maintain that weight.  Today I need just .  If I returned to my old ways and didnt learn how to properly handle my new weight I would gain  pound every  days.

8528353,0,t3_4wjrk6,I cant remember the name off hand but there is a young girl on instagram who lost a ton of weight. She might have a YouTube video as well. Ill try to find her again later. Even tho Im older I found her story very inspiring. Also do what you can now and the rest will come.  I remember that age and feeling frustrated at my lack of control.  Being older with a place of your own and a job will happen faster than you think.  Its enough to know you want to change. Lots of research. Walking cutting wayyy back on sugar and carbs helped me a lot. Not just with weight but also my  mood and my skin and with not getting sick. Dont expect help from others.  Its shitty but true imeYouTubers I like that you could check out  theyre older tho are highcarbhannah spud fit hes eating only potatoes for a year and theres a video with Dr. Robert lutwig?  About sugar. That should get you started.  Also Fed Up on Netflix,loseit,d67lvyi,1,t5_2rz8w

8538197,0,t3_4wojjf,Hi all! As the intro says I recently Hit a rough spot and need a pickmeup. As summer vacation is ending people are dying to hang out. So in the past three days I have eaten all with friends dim sum Italian food with the pasta this time! BBQ sushi and pizza. I drank a lot of wine. I tracked it all as best as I could. But Im up TEN !!!! X!!! pounds. My logical brain tells me there is no way I could have consumer  extra calories. I kept working out the whole time. Today is my Day  again. Im super bummed. But on the flip side I feel DISGUSTING. Like bloated gross lethargic argh AND this is not even eating like I would on a normal day before I started back on this weight loss journey. This entire foodfilled weekend did not involve ONE dessert. I passed all the sweets. When I wasnt out with friends I ate lean protein and veggies not my usual prelifestyle change bacon egg cheese. If I gained this much weight passing the dessert table and feel this bad I cannot imagine how chronically terrible I felt before. I would have to either have slow creep or fight to get back to where I was. I feel like Ive made real change. Now Im just scared these lbs wont come off and like I look like a marshmallow that was put in the microwave.   tldr  Ate too much gained lbs feel sadawfuldepressedlethargic need to have the logical part of my brain kick in to tell me CICO will work again like it worked before. ,loseit,d68ub0f,3,t5_2rz8w

8552036,0,t3_4wugx9,I  got an official diagnosis yesterday. Lupus and a second autoimmune disease called Sjorgrens syndrome.  On top of type  diabetes PCOS and hypothyroidism.  I honestly feel like Im being pranked at this point. Right now the plan is to start a new medication for the autoimmune issues and modify my diet to help reduce inflammation.  I looked at Dr. Weils anti inflammatory diet and the only issue I have with it is that I cant have as much soy as it recommends. But other than that  it seems like something I can realistically follow without any problems.  Once I start to feel better and have more energy and less pain I can start with the gentle exercise again and that should help even more. But yeah. This at least explains the years long weight loss and wellness plateau Ive explained away as due to stress and aging. Id rather it had just been stress and aging though. ,loseit,d6akt0y,7,t5_2rz8w

8572980,0,t3_4x7vsm,Fat loss is immediate and it is entirely dependant on how much below your TDEE you are eating.  If you eat  calories less food than your body burns that day then your body just burned  calories or th of a lb worth of adipose fat.How much weight did you lose?  I have no idea because your weight is composed of water too but if you ate  calories less than your body burned it burned  calories worth of fat instead.The scale is useful to track trends but is going to be pretty inaccurate I find it swings more wildly the more weight I lose but I know that if I trust my deficit if I continue to eat a specific amount of calories every day Ill burn fat at a relatively steady rate despite what the scale may show.TLDR trust the deficitgtMy TDEE is about  lightly active and  moderate.Do not do this if you are serious about losing fat.  Especially if you then track your calories from exercise which I also do not recommend.  Set the calculator to sedentary.  Seriously.  Eat less calories if you are serious about losing weight.I weigh slightly less than you do walk  steps per day and do powerlifting  times a week a relatively intense workout for an old guy and if I eat  calories per day I gain weight.  I keep my calories right around  per day and lose around . lbs per week.,loseit,d6d7dni,2,t5_2rz8w
8573377,0,t3_4x7eso,Ok everyone is going to tell you its bullshit and his premise of this causes you to melt fat because you have nothing in your tank is bullshit.HOWEVER...The process that hes talking about is actually  scientifically proven.  Just not in the way he applies it.Cardio exercise while done at  of your Hear Rate Reserve his calculation is very crude and not entirely accurate but gets you pretty close burns a higher proportion of energy from fat rather than from carbohydrates.  Now he says to do it totally fasted cuz you have  in your body but you actually do.  You carry glycogen about  calories worth with you in your muscle mass so youve always got carbohydrates to burn as a fuel source when needed.  The reason that you target that  of HRR though is that the body oxidizes fat for approximately  of its energy and glycogen for about .  Youre burning more fat.Great right?  Sorta.If you jog  mile in that cardio zone youll burn about  calories.   calories being fat and  being glycogen carbs.If you RUN and your heart rate is nearing your vOmax around  of your HRR for that same mile youll burn nearly twice as many calories.  The difference is your body NEEDS the energy immediately and turns to the faster oxidizing glycogen to fuel the run.  So it becomes a burn of something like  fat and  glycogen.  You burn more calories but it comes from a different place.It also stresses a different system.  The first scenario is an aerobic workout meaning that you give your body enough oxygen to constantly fuel its needs at its desired level.  The nd being anaerobic where for a short burst youre stressing the system and making it resort to the easier fuel to burn for lack of oxygen.This is where the REAL benefit of working in that target zone that the presenter espouses comes from.  You can improve and do aerobic exercise for a nearly unlimited amount of time.  Your system carries s of thousands of calories of fat at all times so if you keep your heart rate at a level of  of HRR youll burn the fuel at the rate that optimizes fat rather than glycpgen for basically as long as you can.  Ever hear of ultramarathoners?  Thats these guys.  They can run  miles burning largely fat reserves because they keep their heart rates down.  Sprinters?  They burn huge amounts of calories for a short time.  The longest an elite runner can work at vOmax is between k and k then even world champion marathoners start to dial it back to lactate threshold.So while it doesnt matter if you exercise totally fasted or after a meal there is absolutely scientific fact to doing cardio at the target of  of your Heart Rate Reserve.urocier,loseit,d6d965f,3,t5_2rz8w

8593681,0,t3_4xinl8,Thats basically what I do. Ive been on doctorsupervised diets since October and was on an extreme one until about a month ago. It was a liquid diet that put a lot of strain on my gallbladder and Ive somehow developed acid reflux during weight loss. Both of those mean I need to eat really lean for health reasons.Greens n beans are the heart of my diet. I do oatmeal for breakfast beans on a salad for lunch scatter fruit and veg around all day as snacks and often a stir fry for dinner. Ive gotten used to cooking without oil and got a nice nonstick pan to help with it. I also use whole fruit instead of sugar as sweeteners so it gives me a little more water and fiber to feel full. There are essential fatty acids you need to eat for health though notably omega s and s. I would highly recommend adding one tablespoon of ground flaxseed a day. I add mine to my oatmeal. Its got a lot of fiber so it adds some substance to the food you mix it with and its got both omega s and s.Edit I just wanted to add make sure you track on MFP at least for a while to figure out your nutrition. If your only proteinheavy source is kidney beans you could easily slip a little too low in protein. You want at least g a day if youre not exercising. I eat a lot of tofu  tempeh.,loseit,d6fsu97,5,t5_2rz8w

You could pack your own food but you could also hit one of the asian stands the brisket or even the burgers if theyre not crazy things. Id say go there walk around to see what all your options are and then pick something. If nothing else by the time youve walked the full circuit youll have burned off some of the excess calories. I go to the Texas State Fair most years and its home to the craziest deep fried everything but its not that occasional trip that made me fat. Last time I went I wore my pedometer and put in just over  miles walking the fair ground.  Id also go with a group of friends and wed tried some of the worst fried things fried butters actually pretty good but fried pineapple upside down cakes and fried smores are better but wed split them  ways and the portions arent huge. Then my family traditionally skips the corny dogs and things and hits the food pavilion for something there. They have bbq chili Mediterranean carribean pretty much any food you could think of.

CICO diet targeting  cals a day. Currently Im doing a HIIT focused bodyweight routine push ups squats planks crunches pike presses high knees jumping jacks etc. Ive already noticed some lean muscle gains from it. But eventually I want to move lifting. I already have a benchweights and in the upcoming months Id like to start cycling lifting into my routine. What did your starting lifting routine look like and what is your current routine? Have you noticed lean gains from it in a deficit or are you cycling increased calories on days when you lift? So far I have noticed muscle gains while being on a deficit with my current routine but I understand most of that is likely due to newbie gains and starting out being very overweight. From what Ive read these types of gains arent sustainable on a long term deficit. Im trying to debate whether it makes more sense to hit my goal while working my current HIIT routine and then start maintainingincreasing calories while lifting. Or to just jump into lifting sooner.,loseit,d6nzzv2,1,t5_2rz8w

8682109,0,t3_4ytw17,The realization that I dont have to eat it all andor that Im eating for health and not entertainment.  I think in the past I had this bad habit of grabbing food and mindlessly eating it while doing something else usually studying or watching TV.  So I was using it as entertainment which looking back came from the bad habits I had learned from my parents one would steal food off my plate if he was still hungry and nothing was left on the table and the other would binge until she was sick.  And I had this mindset that if I didnt eat it all then that others would eat it and I wouldnt be able to eat it.   So coming to terms with the idea that if I save it for later it will still be there was this huge obstacle to get over.  Same with that I didnt have to eat if food was offered or that I didnt have to eat while being entertained.  I no longer had to binge to be able to have some for myself it was there.

Ive lost muscle mass.  It happens.  If I regain back to  my lean mass will be significantly lower than my brothers who has been  for years... why?  Well he has the muscle built up from carrying  pounds around.  I wont.  Ill have packed fat on fat on fat.

8688847,0,t1_d6rcstr,I think most people here are interpreting what she said as well you cant do anything to change your body effectively as an excuse. I think what she was really trying to convey is that using your willpower for a long period of time can lead some people to gain their weight back once that willpower dissapears. Now knowing you you seem to have passed the point where its necessary to use your willpower because its just something you do on a regular basis and Im happy for you. But Ive tried CICO several times once I even lost  lbs and I always end up failing because I lose my drive. I just think approaching this differently i.e. eat only when hungry eat good foods dont try to suffocate your feelings in food could work for me without using the set point concept as an excuse.,loseit,d6rqezb,2,t5_2rz8w

You and I have almost the exact same starting stats. When I was heavier I wondered more like hoped that it was some medical issues causing my weight gain. But in reality its the other way around. Once I lost some weight my PCOS went away my depression and anxiety is almost non existent my diabetes risks went away I have tons more energy now etc etc. You will most likely experience the same thing so I wouldnt worry about spending a shit ton of money on doctors and lab testing right now unless you lose weight and still continue to experience other symptoms. ,loseit,d6s2y49,1,t5_2rz8w

8699964,0,t3_4z4u41,It is absolutely physically impossible at your current weight to be eating less than  calories and not be losing weight. You say you are measuring your food how so? Are you using a kitchen scale? If not buy one like yesterday and properly measure out your food. If after another month you have still not lost weight get checked for a  lb. tumor because that is the only legit medical condition that could possibly explain why youre not losing weight.    Im coming off as harsh but you need to step back and actually be honest with yourself. Math doesnt lie. The only error here is human.         EDIT I wanted to bring up another possibility that could explain why youre not losing weight. Do you drink beer or other forms of alcohol? If you are still drinking while cutting calories then you are clearly not logging into MFP the drinks you are consuming. Alcohol especially beer has a lot of calories. An IPA typically has  calories per bottle. If youre pounding  beers four times a week hypothetically not saying you do youre consuming an extra  calories per week that you are not accounting for. Other forms of alcohol like wine spirits etc. can also be very calorific. ,loseit,d6t4lk5,3,t5_2rz8w

After  weeks it hasnt had a negative impact on my weight loss and its still following the projected path according to MFP and FitBit Charge HR.Which FitBit you have might make a difference though.I think the difference in opinion comes from people at different places in their weight loss journey. When youre bigger and aiming to eat  cal a day having a  cal deficit including exercise might not hit you as hard. When you are only eating  a day having a  cal deficit is really noticeable and generally makes me feel weak and exhausted. I personally need to stick to around  cal a day to feel okay.

8705021,0,t3_4z7nti, Do you think your mental health played a part in your weight gain?I think so. Ive been overweight and obese all my life and I know that a lot of the weight gain in my childhood came from using food as a coping mechanism.  Do you take any medication? How does it affect your ability to lose?I currently only take allergy medication and lowdose aspirin neither of which are for mental health purposes. They dont really have any impact on my weight loss other than the Zyrtec occasionally causing me to feel sleepy and ready to go to bed as soon as I get home haha How do you decide what to prioritise on days when youve run out of the ability to do both?On days when things get really tough I try to prioritize staying within my daily calorie goals and not giving in to emotional eating. Even if Im unable to get up and go for a walk I consider the day a win if Ive made healthy and positive choices with my food throughout the day. Has improving your physical health improved your mental health ability to manage your mental health?I think its very cyclical for me in that improving my mental health has helped me to become more physically active e.g. having the drive to be consistent with taking daily walks sticking to my workout routine etc.. At the same time improving my physical health has had tremendous benefits for my mental and emotional wellbeing.  How do you prepare for and cope with bad patches?I try to prepare as much as possible by writing down a list of upcoming stressors so that Ill know what to expect. Even so things can sometimes turn out to be worse than anticipated.For example I knew that August would be the busiest month here at work so thats what I had prepared for. However what I didnt know was that there would be a lot more changes and initiatives implemented at the same time which have significantly impacted my ongoing stress and depression. Its been really hard since Im also trying to help my wife understand what Im going through because shes never seen me like this in our  years together.To cope with everything I go to therapy once a week and talk it all out. Ultimately I know that in this instance of depression what I really need to do is change my job fingers crossed for my internal promotion that should be coming soon!. But in the meantime I take things one day at a time. I celebrate the small victories and remind myself that Im doing all of the right things by getting the help that I need and doing my best to keep moving forward. Even if its something as simple as celebrating the fact that I was able to get out of bed take a shower and eat wellportioned meals thats something. I might not be able to change everything thats causing my current mental health situation but I can change the little things here and there that make up the whole of how Im choosing to react to it.,loseit,d6trfo3,2,t5_2rz8w
8706314,0,t1_d6tvclw, Im willing to work out MonFri as often as necessary. The weekends are a bit more difficult to commit to. Just installed it. After putting in my current weight of  my target of  and my goal of  lbs. per week it tells me my daily should be  calories. It looks like if I do decide to go keto again for the weight drop that there is the ability to set up custom goals in MyFitnessPal specifically for that type of weightloss. Thats cool. I just went to mytdee.com and ran through a number of calculations. It looks like  calories a day will be the sweet spot depending on how much Im working out.I downloaded a few apps as well such as Ck and the accompanying  pushupssitupsetc. My thinking is that would be a good way to start since they are very rigid and structured programs specifically meant for out of shape people. Then once I complete those I can hit up a personal trainer here locally and have them design a workout for me and my home gym.I appreciate your reply.

8712148,0,t1_d6ulck4,Imo its weird to ask someone out when you dont know them at all. Just approaching a stranger and asking is weird. Let an attractive stranger be just that. Admire. Move on with your life. If you are in a place like a bar or a social gathering make conversation. REAL conversation. Dont make it about sex or her face or her body. Talk to her like a normal human being. If you have things in common and are hitting it off keep talking to her and keep treating her like a real person. This is important! If shes not interested or you have no common ground to discuss leave her alone. I dont care how hot she is sometimes people dont connect. Thats okay. By no means should you lie about yourself to fit some sort of ideal that you think she would prefer. That will always come back to bite you in the ass. Just be yourself. If she doesnt like you go find someone who does.Eventually there will come a time that you must part ways bar closesone of you has to leave. If you had a good conversation NOW would be a good time to say. Hey I had a really good time talking to you. We should hangout sometime. Heres my number. Actually its better to insert something specific instead of hangout sometime. Im sure something came up in conversation. That new coffee shop downtown the modern art exhibit at the museum those weird beer bike tour things ComicCon ? These are all oddly specific suggestions that would work on me but not every woman. Which is why in addition to treating her like a person you have to actually pay attention to what she likes. She might call you she might not. Most importantly you tried. I know you didnt get a simple magic answer but just like weight loss forming an emotional bondromantic relationship takes work.Edit Lmao! I love that I got down voted for this.

8724786,0,t3_4zi3w6,I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was . I was skinny as a rail at the time about lbs  but I had the mild hirsutism and greasy skin and irregular and super painful periods. For me the weight gain started when I went on the pill to control the PCOS. It made me hungrier and having never really had to watch my diet previously before I knew it I was at the higher end of the healthy BMI range. I went to the doctor and she told me Well you know you have the PCOS so weight loss will be very difficult for you. which I took to mean Dont try. There was no encouragement from her just Meh its going to be really hard if you try to do it.One morning I got on the scale and I had reached . Borderline overweight BMI. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw how I had begun to hide my body with loose clothing and I said Fuck this.The thing about it that pisses me off the most now Im at GW is how simple it was. I could have done this  years ago. Yes the carb cravings are real so real omg and the plateaus are frustrating but you download MFP you spend two minutes logging and measuring a day and you work out how to fit in some exercise so you tighten up as you go I took up Ck and now I run .k  times a week. It might take a little more discipline for me than for someone who doesnt have PCOS but it works exactly the same way. All it took was some effort some self control and the complete refusal to get discouraged the last bit is the most important IMO. I have been at maintenance for a couple of months and its wonderful. I go to happy hour I drink beer I eat pizza and burgers and I did those things as I was losing weight too you just have to balance it out and remember to stop at two slices instead of four. Always log your intake so no nasty surprises.Last night I went out for happy hour with the girls and had two pints of imperial stout a plate of poutine a jalapeno popper wrapped in bacon a generous scoop of strawberry sorbet and a whiskey. This morning I got on the scale and Ive lost a pound. I laughed my head off. A year ago I couldnt have imagined standing on the scales and laughing.

8750238,0,t3_4zur3j,Started a new medication that sent my cravings through the roof which lead to lots and lots of binges on junk food like  strawberry rolls in ten minutes...it was bad...Im not bingeing anymore but I am still slowly gaining weight thats partly my fault as I could eat healthier which would help a lot but Ive been stubborn and stuck with the fact that I can eat whatever I want in moderation and still lose weight. I need to both eat better and get on a different medicine as it still causes cravings.,loseit,d6zfp1p,2,t5_2rz8w
8750581,0,t3_4zw9li,Im sorry if im repeating I didnt read all the responses.Maybe the important thinkg at this time would be to focus on living a healthy lifestyle and take a break from the scale.  Give yourself a break from the stress.  I recently listened to a podcast called Half Size Me.  Episode  has an interview with a women who lost weight despite PCOS.  She like you was frustrated with her lack of progress and lack of help from medical professionals.  She said the key for her was less about calorie intake by number and more about eating clean.  Taking processed and diet food out of the picture changed her life.  The guests interviewed in that show often give contact information  maybe she would be willing to speak to you directly?  I have no affiliation with the show just a random listener.Have you tried an endocrinologist?Hope this helps good luck!,loseit,d6zh8u6,9,t5_2rz8w

8768339,0,t3_5077fv, My face turns red when I push myself too. It used to do it even rushing back and forth around at work.

I never used to be cold. I get cold now and I dont sweat nearly as much.   Most exciting NSV....thats tough. I think my favorite was taking a full body picture of myself and actually being okay with everyone seeing it. Not wanting to grab it and hide or message someone and ask them to take it off facebook because I was embarrassed.

8827145,0,t3_5117sd,I do crossfit.Eat meat and vegetables nuts and seeds some fruit little starch and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts deadlift clean squat presses clean and jerk and snatch. Similarly master the basics of gymnastics pullups dips rope climbs pushups situps presses to handstand pirouettes flips splits and holds. Bike run swim row etc hard and fast. Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense.

8829382,0,t1_d7935v0,gt Ive always been under the impression that those are two competing goals as one requires a deficit while the other a surplus.One of the many myths spread from the CICO community.... in the last  months ive lost lbs of weight but lost lbs of fat. the missing lbs has been put on as muscle. and i never count calories.  Now to do this you must first understand a few thingsFirstly data is king. you need to track your body to understand what you are doing to your body. start tracking Weight body fat percentage fat mass weight x body fat percentage lean mass everything thats not fat this is what shows your muscle gain and then Chest Waist Biceps and thigh measurements. you can now see gains and losses and from which areas of your body they are coming.Secondly you need to understand what the general food groups do for you and when you should use them. my general diet is split into  sections. basic pre workout and cheat day.Basic  days a week  high protein high fat high fibre no sugar minimal carbs. so in food terms this is a breakfast of eggs cooked in a little butter with some cooked frozen mixed veg. lunch is normally something like a salmon or tuna with salad watch out for hidden sugar in salad dressings or more vegetables. dinner is normally meat chicken turkey pork beef steak and vegetables. vegetables does not include any type of potato or starchy veg like parsnip. All meals should include g protein... no need to worry too much about calories as its pretty tough to overeat like this obviously dont take that as a challengePre workout so this is the meal you should eat about  mins before you work out to give your body what you need during your work out. High protein High Fibre and a portion of complex carbs something like a small sweet potato. This meal should happen about  times a week any more and youre working out to often. Cheat day Eat whatever you like for  hours.... try not to binge but have all the things that youve been craving during the week. This keeps you sane. Try and make sure this falls on a work out day.all the above should keep you losing body fat or at least make sure you dont gain if youre already lt  body fat you wont lose much fat if anyThe third thing to understand is how to work out to optimise muscle gain... personally ive found the  sets to failure and max rest method. so what does this mean? well to start with you are going to create  work out sessions. this is so you can separate out the muscle groups. I do legs and core in one session then chest shoulders arms and back in a different session. You would ideally work out every other day and alternate your sessions each work out day. so for example Monday gt legs and core Tuesday gt rest Wednesday gt chest shoulders arms and back Thursday gt rest... and then repeat on a loop. This ensures you get enough rest for full muscle recovery for each muscle group. In terms of the exercises you can research which ones you want to do to get the body you want. as for the sets reps and weight i work of the following sets of each exercise. each set is to failure i.e when you cant lift another rep. When setting the weight you want to make sure that that failed rep happens between rep . this may take a couple of sessions to work out but the general rule is if youre hitting  in any of the  sets increase the weight if youre not making  in any of the  sets reduce the weight. Always lift to failure even if that means doing  reps and make the adjustment for the next set.That should be the basic framework. All you need to do then is use the data you collect and make adjustments where necessary. if youre not gaining muscle increase the pre workout carbs and fats. if youre gaining fat double check what you are eating on the basic diet doesnt include starches and lots of refined sugar.Sorry i know thats a lot of information to take in but it should get you going in the right direction. have fun and dont be afraid to use yourself as an experiment. try things and analyse the data. ,loseit,d7962pq,2,t5_2rz8w

Your body has a max that it will burn in a day  and if you push too hard beyond that important metabolic functions like immune system activity and even ovulation will be sacrificed to stay under that limit.Second thing you dont need to IF to lose weight or be healthy.

8886281,0,t1_d7fzkp0,gt What is powerlifting best for?Powerlifting is awesome for strength development and overall body devolpment.  I finally after years of onagain offagain to be honest mostly off attempts to lift weights landed on powerlifting for the following reasons. easy to track progress.  Since my routine has fewer unique exercises only  or  depending on current routine  at the moment that I really care about I do assistance work but its secondary its very easy to record and track progress unlike when I was doing  different exercises for each specific muscle group.. Ease of learning.  Learning correct form on  lifts makes it easier to really focus on the details and get the form perfect to reduce chance of injury and maximize effectiveness.. Short workouts.. more even muscle development since each of the exercises use multiple muscle groups and muscles they develop pretty evenly without focusing isolation on this or that.. raw strength.  Its pretty cool to walk up to a bar that is loaded with more weight than I weighed at my largest and pick that fucker straight up off of the ground.gt I want my stomach to be tonedIm pretty bad at doing ab specific exercises because I dont find them enjoyable and I cant really track the progress like I can with lifting.  Fortunately since everything I do uses my whole body more or less that includes my core.  I really should do more hanging leg lifts and the like but its hard to find the motivation.gtGet rid of flab under armsIf you mean fat keep eating at a deficit.  There is no way to specifically target fat from any one area of your body.  Your body uses fat in the order it sees fit it wont burn fat from your arms simply because you work your arms it will burn fat from your arms when it decides thats where it wants to use fat from.If you are talking about loose skin building those muscles specifically will help fill the skin in some so its less loose looking.  Powerlifting doesnt really address this issue per se.

I topped out at  earlier this year and yes that was entirely too big. Ive been losing it since am at  and while Ive got atleast  more lbs to go Im starting to see hints of the shape Id like to be. What I REALLY want though is to be fitter. At my highest weight I couldnt walk briskly for more than a few short minutes. I want to change that to where if my knees can handle it I can jog or possibly even run. Whatever size I end up at in the process of getting fitter Ill be happy with. But if I start getting to those tiny sizes Ill conciously make an effort to stop losing weight. I dont think skinny is for everyone. And those BMI charts and the doctors who look at them along without taking reality into consideration can go bleep themselves.

IF might be an option cutting out most junk food and drink calories being mindful of eating more veggies with less sauces avoiding eating too much breadcerealmeatcalorie dense food eating out less and cooking more at home with less or no oilsbutter etc. Be mindful of whether youre actually hungry or just having a craving.,loseit,d7txsvx,3,t5_2rz8w

There are muscles in your body which you probably dont use. Muscles are a big part of holding bones in place so if you have some atrophying muscles they will let some bones slip out of place which can cause bad posture bad body structure which leads to fat building in strange places. If you hit every muscle group even lightly it should solve allot of your problems Diet is  of the game which you seem to know but you gotta make sure you dont have atrophying muscles if you want to look healthy.,loseit,d7uup20,-1,t5_2rz8w

These conditions are complex and there are literally like  that you can even survive with longterm.  This article has made it seem like its common and you could be one of those people.  . of people are not those people.  The people that have severely affected metabolisms are very aware of their condition because it affects their life in every single way.  The most wellknown person I can think of with one of these metabolic conditions is Lizzie Velsquez  Weather waxs article seems more like a welldisguised advertisement for MedGem.

Seems the  split is the most common fast for  hours eating window for . I see people doing their window from pmpm where they fast all morning then have a big lunch and dinner or just a big dinner and then stop eating after ten. But the window would be whatever fit your schedule best. I think this works for people because say their daily intake is  they can have two large meals  cals each or a huge meal for basically all their cals at once or however they wanna break it up. If someone is struggling feeling full and satisfied on a bunch of small meals a day and feels too restricted I think having the bigger meals helps with that. You can find more about it by searching around this sub. Hope this helps  On MFP for something like that I generally just type in the ingredients manually if I cant find something close. Sometimes I can find things better by adding restaurant style at the front of whatever Im searching and seeing if I see a similar one.

Getting back those  pounds which are likely water weight doesnt mean that you actually gained back  pounds necessarily. Think of the food we eat thats bad  it is just loaded with sodium. Way more than you would have if you were just eating your normal calories. Sodium causes water retention. I am battling the same issue.

The nagging has been getting worse with myself as I feel my goal is so close I want to get there faster but I wont give in. I wont give in because those nagging feelings to skip a meal or purge are not in my best interest the nagging wants me to take a route that is unhealthy the route that will make me pass out when I stand up or unable to concentrate in class. I know that with my  limit I will lose weight and it will be slower yes but I wont make myself ill and itll be sustainable. Id suggest sticking with MFP make it a goal to reach your calories you will still lose weight and you will be healthy you wont get sick and most importantly you will be able to keep it up. It is a sustainable limit to have. I found it kind of appealed to my food obsessed tenancies as I know exactly what is going in and exactly how much and how many calories Im eating. If it wont work another comment suggested other diet options such as keto working out is also an option as long as its not overexercising. Id also maybe suggest a counseling session if you cant talk to familyfriends about your worries maybe they will suggest something which will work for you or that have worked for others with eating disorders. ,loseit,d88lc0p,3,t5_2rz8w

You will see a difference within the first few weeks. Take the other advice here weight loss is mostly about how much you are eating. Calculate your TDEE and eat  calories lower than that each day. You do not have to do any exercise to lose weight. You do not have to eat any different or more healthy than you are now all you have to do is eat less.

9151490,0,t3_55n1eg,I actually have some experience in this matter so hopefully what I say will help. Earlier this year I contracted a serious stomach bug that put me in the hospital. I ended up with an infection in my stomach and an ulcer to boot. Needless to say eating for me was a challenge for a long time. During that time I saw the scale go down as low as  and I was freaking out! My doctor however was not and told me to just worry about getting back to  stomach wise so I stuck with his crazy liquid diet and medication until I was fully healed. So what happened to me when I started eating normally again? My first day I ate all the things which wasnt a good idea but I had felt that starvation for so long. With that out of my system I just went back to normal caloriesfood and within  weeks my weight popped back up. I filled back out could no longer see bones etc. The majority of the weight loss was actually water weight and I had been on a liquid diet for a month. Now as far as your concern about losing your progress on CK dont worry about it. Within a couple weeks of returning to your running schedule you will be back to normal if not sooner. I love to lift weightsrun and was worried too but it only took a week to get back to normal. That being said the first two weeks of healthy eating I did nothing but focus on sleep and recovery and started exercising again after that.Long story short. Youre not going to lose all youve done from your illness. Drop the stress and just focus on feeling better. The rest of it will fall right back into place when you are well. Feel better soon OP!,loseit,d8c0nal,3,t5_2rz8w

My eating patterns are healthier now but I find having too great of a calorie deficit for too long makes me want to binge. Eating at a deficit of about  cals for one week then eating at maintenance for another week before going back to the deficit helps me with this. The weight loss is slow but it sticks. It sounds like youve lost quite a lot of weight this month  maybe reducing the deficit a bit might help stop the urge to binge.I read a great book about overcoming bulimiabinge eating recently called Brain Over Binge somebody mentioned it on here which made me go and buy it you might find that an interesting read. One of the things she writes about is how eating at a big deficit for extended periods of time can prime the mindbody to want to binge.

9162095,0,t1_d8dcxej,I wouldnt be too worried. Youve done it before you can do it again. Sorry you had to go through such a rough period of time. As long as youre ready to move past that I dont see it being a huge issue. Youve got to be doing everything in your power though every day to make sure youre staying on track. On something this strict you cant really afford to relax. As long as youve got the right mindset though Im fairly confident even more so if youre okay with  calories. No offence but youre just a short guy its usually not recommended for men to go under  unless its a special circumstance and youre definitely one of those circumstances where your body will genuinely probably be okay at  calories as a male. Its very easy for taller guys to burn out on that type of calorie intake. ,loseit,d8dd2f7,1,t5_2rz8w

After working with a trainer and nutritionist I learned quickly that you cant build muscle without gaining weight. So if youre lifting you might see the scale go up. Your body will look better but the scale wont if that makes sense. It REALLY threw me for a loop when I started and if i wasnt doing photo progress pics and only relying on the scale i would have completely thrown in the towel. If you want to lose weight and keep your calories as they are just exercise more. If you want to tone up and stop being skinny fat expect a jump in the scale when you start lifting consistently. ,loseit,d8dkv8h,1,t5_2rz8w

You can still overeat or undereat healthy foods.Its a lot easier than it seems.  In fact give it a whirl.  Dont change a single thing about the way you are eating but track all of it for two weeks.  It might be an eye opener you might also find that you can reintroduce some of your favorite items back into your diet.  Being able to eat a piece of pizza here and there or enjoy a burger and fries oh and beer did I mention beer? without worrying if I just gained a lb has been life changing for me.,loseit,d8e131h,1,t5_2rz8w

I was at the lower end of the normal weight range until I was  then bullyingmoving had me obese by the time I was  and I stayed that way until this past winter. I really dont remember much about my skinny toddler days though.Now Im exactly one pound away from a healthy BMI and it is so so weird. For some reason Im always looking down at my hands. I can see the outline of all my hand bones now where I could never see one before. I hardly recognize myself in the mirror especially since I started wearing makeup every day and I never did that when I was obese. Its great though. I love the attention and that people are taking me seriously for once.As you can tell from the other posts here its definitely attainable. I knew it was possible for me because I now control all of my meal choices. Until I went to college I ate what my parents made. Even the first year of college I was on a required meal plan and the choices were limited. But now I have my own kitchen and no meal plan and since Im single and dont have kids no one has any say in my meals but me. Its the ideal situation for weight loss and I figured if I dont do this now it will only become increasingly difficult. Not to mention the job stuff.

9290779,0,t3_57li0b,I take Herbalife like NorthernMunkey and shes quite right you need to reduce your intake a bit first. Try taking your lunch to work instead of eating at the canteen since you can pack healthier choices. If you need to control your portions try drinking lots of water since sometimes our bodies mistake thirst for hunger and always drink a glass of water before eating. Herbalifes tea is also really good for burning calories and keeping you energized. DM me and we can work on a meal plan to get you used to eating less before taking Herbalife if youre interested in the products. Good luck on your health journey!,loseit,d8to8e7,1,t5_2rz8w

My TDEE when I started was over  calories... And I have  years on you. If you are realistic and dont make too drastic of a deficit it will be MUCH easier to stick to your weight loss plan.Also home girl you need to eat.  If youre anything like me smoothies are not going to cut it and youre going to be hungry and dissatisfied most of the time. I still do rawfrozen fruit and vegetables in a blender at breakfast to help me supplement my produce intake but I use a food scale  measure everything down to the gram and dont add any liquids besides water...and I still eat a solid breakfast with eggs and toast! Someone further down the thread estimated an appropriate cut for you at  and I think thats reasonable.  You really shouldnt deprive yourself when youre making lifestyle changes like this.  Moderate  gradual adjustments are MUCH more effective. I wanted to mention too the power of a solid snack. A lot of people are super into the  meals a day thing but I love snacks.  In the old days I could trash a bag of chips in front of the tv in one sitting.  Now  I measure out snack bags of chips and enjoy them when I want to. oz of chips is a little blip on my calorie radar but makes it SO much less likely ill have a meltdown and eat half a bag.

9316314,0,t3_57wojr,Ive struggled with binge eating for a long time. Even when I started losing weight I still struggled with wanting to just give in and eat everything in sight. But it wasnt until I looked at the psychological reasons behind the binge that I made an actual change. I read books on compulsive eating and have since gone further into the psychological aspect of eating. Ive had to inspect my emotions and see whats behind the binge because its usually to fill some sort of void. It took a little while but its been about a year since I stopped binging like I used to. I no longer feel out of control when I eat. I will still sometimes feel the want to binge but I can examine where the binge comes from and work that out better without eating an entire bag of chips. Sometimes Ill reach for the chips bit stop after a few because I know whats going on.  I am so much happier now than I was when I used food as a crutch.  The weight loss has just been a symptom now of working towards a healthier mind and relationship with food. ,loseit,d8wwtje,1,t5_2rz8w
9316473,0,t3_581onc,Its really hard to predict how a persons body will respond to fast weight loss. Generally speaking it seems that young people who eat well balanced diet including healthy fats all the needed vitamins amp minerals etc. and have elastic skin either from genetics or being wellmoisturized or both have less loose skin than others. Hormones play a big part here.Theres really not much you can do beyond the aforementioned healthy dietary elements and the external moisturizing  if you end up with loose skin you end up with loose skin. The good news is that Ive seen a ton of people on here say that although they were initially a bit discouraged to see the loose skin it actually improved dramatically over time once their body had a chance to adapt.Ive recently lost lbs from a highest weight of  and Im not noticing any loose skin yet fingers crossed.

Before I know it I am completely off my stride and totally get derailed and the set backs ensue. Happened far too many times.My suggestion is to focus on and do what is working FOR YOU. You successfully lost a consider amount of weight before and that my friend is an accomplishment. I would agree that reasonable moderation in both diet and exercise is more sustainable longterm but I would encourage you to listen to yourself. If something is working for you you are happier and more active that is the way to go. Dont let anyone tell you how to travel this journey.

9383628,0,t3_593qrq,I went backpacking in Asia this summer in the middle of my current weight loss journey and didnt track a single thing. At first I started out with eat whatever but make better choices then I was like fuck this Im also going to eat like an entire sleeve of ritz crackers after a breakfast of a croissant and other shit eating like that with of course a fried noodle dinner.        I came back lbs lighter. Its obviously not what I would have lost in  weeks at home but seriously dont underestimate the amount of calories that being so active burns. Its not even just all the walking its the going out and doing so much rather than sitting around watching TV or sitting at work.       My advice would be try and make good choices but dont limit yourself too much and dont let the lack of calorie counting ruin your trip or have it be too much of a focus or be the thing you think about when you look back on this trip.,loseit,d95fvmk,3,t5_2rz8w

As food calories are really KCal and fiber isnt digestible.There was a lot of emphasis on the food pyramid. Lots of grains very little fat. There was very little explanation on what a serving size really was. I remember a lot of hate on fat. If possible everything should be fat free or low fat. Butter was seen as the most unhealthy food. If possible we were taught to use something like margarine. That the brain needs sugar or it starts to die.

Well tonight she was back and I did the best Ive ever done in her class! I guess my running read slow jogging has really done a lot for my over all fitness.

I find it easier to stay on track with my exercise when I dont have to leave the house to do it. You can actually get in really good cardio from these workouts. If youre working on muscle tone you could always buy a home pullup bar and some free weights. For abs you can do a lot of floorstanding exercise to increase muscle tone.

9455298,0,t3_5a7we5,F  here lost  pounds last year and have been maintaining since March. At  I was at  calories per day during weight loss. Calories are everything. I calculated how many I needed to consume each day in order to lose weight and I stuck to that number. Between September  and March  I dropped  pounds without even much suffering.I dropped a few useless daily habits like a cup of granola on my breakfast yogurt and I asked my SO for help in keeping chips of all kinds out of the house. Wine and chocolate were fitted into the daily budget and the awareness of that latenight treat helped me pass on all the temptations all day long. My clothes became looser very quickly so I was able to really enjoy feeling a little hungry.My only exercise was walking which transitioned into extremely gentle jogging. Oh and biking  miles now and then. Since we have a border collie and he makes the saddest faces in the world when left behind I bike a little less and jog a little more.But it is all calories.

9465088,0,t3_5ae8mc,For weight loss I would suggest sticking to eating your protein instead of drinking it. Mostly because its more satisfying to chew than to chug. Protein drinks can be a decent supplement if you struggle to get enough protein but they arent really a meal replacement. Particularly for long term weight loss management i.e. not gaining it all back once youre at goal its useful to learn how to prep and plan your meals and get accustomed to eating the right amount of food. Not just having a shake instead of a meal. ,loseit,d9frlxv,1,t5_2rz8w

9485244,0,t1_d9i1xdp,I cant think of a time when meal prepping is more useful currently on food stamps myself. Also I dont weigh my food either. I set a lower calorie goal for the day than really necessary by about  calories. Anyway eat the same thing everyday? I have the same breakfast and same lunch and then have a few options for dinner. I premade a lot of soups portion them with measuring cups into Ziploc and then freeze. Then I add the recipe into mfp but just copying and pasting the link from online sometime before I get around to eating it. Then its there in my recipe tab forever and easy to click. Can make a few things at a time and get it all out of the way in one day. Its really convenient for budgeting as well.

9503534,0,t1_d9khyze,Main reasons I really like the HR. The screen!  The bigger screen makes it a lot easier to see a lot of info there are more clockfaces though not nearly enough and I wish there was a rd party app for it but oh well and the screens haptic taptic? haha feedback is much more responsive than HRs where I basically had to punch the shit out of it to get it to respond to tapping.. A BIG one is that this actively buzzes when I need to get my  steps in per hour during my  hour activity period so it gets me up and out of my desk. I really really like that.  Not to mention for small text messages it buzzes and I can read them or when I get phone calls it buzzes and I can see whos calling me.. Varied workout modes are really cool touch.  I admit I default to Workout for mine lol since I do circuit training with cardio and weight lifting but it has specific buzztimers for HIIT handles yoga weight lifting walks biking etc.  Just nice little extras.. The relax mode is dumb and gimmicky but I really like it anyway...  When Im super stressed it calms me down.. I like teal..   So the wrist band color is nice. Also the fact that I can change out the wrist band is really cool hoping rd party folks can do that before Christmas.. BIGGEST REASON.  BIGGEST MOST IMPORTANT REASON. The green light no longer blinds me in the middle of the night.  Admittedly the front screen is bigger and brighter so occasionally itll wake up with wrist gestures but Ive never even seen the green light on the back of my HR  versus my HR waking me up nightly with that godawful lime light.. The side button is much much bettereasier to press.ConsThe vibration buzz for the alarm is super weak so I dont use it.Im not as used to the band as I was for the HR its clasp is a little clunkier.Overall way worth it for me.,loseit,d9kihdq,6,t5_2rz8w

You might find that you can get the body you want by working out and starting to lift weights instead of having to cut calories. Check out the people on rprogresspics that havent had much weight change or have actually gained weight and see how different a body can look if it has a higher  muscle and lower  body fat.    If you really are set on losing weight I would absolutely not go below  and youre not THAT short so IMO you shouldnt really go down under .

I knew that going in so wasnt going for a PR but was still a little frustrated by my time. It was a k and the longer racers were just an extra loop so the winner of the k passed me and they pushed all of us kers to the side...which meant not able to pass for the last mile of the race.

Add height and weight to that and yeah in comparison to you he can eat a lot but likely not when compared apples to apples with a similar agedheightweight male.,loseit,d9r58yo,9,t5_2rz8w

9561886,0,t1_d9rowl4,I recommend that you do start tracking.  If youre losing fat youre currently eating at a deficit.  Its advisable to gain consistency in your deficit and to lose at a sustainable rate and both of these ends are much easier to predict if you actually count the calories going into your body.Youve likely lost a ton of water and since you are eating less food you have less food and waste in your digestive system adding weight.  Its perfectly normal to lose a lot in the early stages.  Its also perfectly normal to lose none.  Its highly dependent on if you were retaining water at your first weigh in and if you are retaining more or less water now.Start tracking. That way if you do succumb to temptation and eat something bad although no food is truly bad food youll have a better idea of where to adjust elsewhere in the day to minimize the caloric impact.,loseit,d9rp5og,2,t5_2rz8w

I like walking a whole lot too but running saves time and is better for keeping our heart and brain healthier for our old age.  Walking is amazing for your skeleton. Have you thought of something nice to do for yourself to celebrate when you make it though a week of staying committed to your lifestyle changes?

9655620,0,t1_da37w6j,Haha thanks I know we are the minority here I seem to be part of the minority on a lot of subjects here though since I am very macrobody composition conscious and have a very open view of food... but eh but its nice to see others I think I just like the idea of lightly active for people because I think its better to start off a bit high than low. I find it easier to go down in calories than to go back up especially if its a big jump right away. Especially at first if someone is used to a lot of food the smaller the change the easier it would likely be to adjust. I really do dislike people saying that walking half an hour a day or so as part of your daily nonexercise lifestyle ie its not something you plan to do but just happens means the person is sedentary. If I ate for sedentary when Im not exercising but still get in some walking Id lose faster than I want! But Ive found that even during weeks where I lay around a lot and dont do most of the walking I would normally do I still lose at roughly the same rate as I do when I select lightly active. So for instance one summer while off school I think I was something and lost just over lbs in a month I didnt do the walking I normally would do and did the same amount of moderate activity at that time I believe I did do more moderate cardio which I dont do now because I probably wanted to eat more food lol. Im used to  cals now though and dont mind it as Id done during school but didnt change my activity level and still lost at the same rate. But idk exactly how to explain the lack of significant difference despite the change in NEAT activity considering when I use TDEE calculators that allow you to account for nonexercise and exercise activity exrx.net and healthcalc removing that light activity lowers my TDEE by a good ish calories.,loseit,da398jq,2,t5_2rz8w

Right now its not so bad because its easier for you to make a calorie deficit since youre bigger and your TDEE is higher. As you get closer to your goal weight your TDEE will get smaller and therefore your deficit will get smaller.

9730066,0,t3_5ehkc2,gtThe sceintists data showed this was likely because they ate about  calories less at high altitudes than they did at normal elevations. They may have felt less hungry in part because levels of leptin the satiety hormone surged during the stay while grehlin the hunger hormone remained unchanged. Their metabolic rate also spiked meaning they burned more calories than they usually did.Nowhere in that article or the WIRED article it links to does it say what the increase in metabolic rate actually was.  I would assume its pretty small.I mean if that works for you awesome not many people can just pack up their lives and move to the mountains.

And rather than a treat meal you could just eat anything youd like in moderation throughout the week. IIFYM There is no shit when it comes to food. Diet is about context not individual foods. If you eat a donut with your dinner that isnt eating shit. Moderation and variety is all you need for health along with exercise.Not restricting your diet or forcing yourself to do cardio in a way that you dont find sustainable and not being so anal about what you eat ie planning too much  perhaps just make large recipes so you have leftovers? will probably lead to far less burn out.,loseit,dacrgjw,2,t5_2rz8w

I feel so bad about myself all the time and especially when the scale doesnt move for a couple of days. I get all these paranoid thoughts what if Im not tracking correctly I am what if my body is so fucked up from everything I did to it that now it can only lose weight if I more or less literally dont eat physically impossible what if Im lowering my criteria and losing focus and letting myself stagnate in this awful body once again. Ive been failing at this for almost a decade and Ive proven that Im weak and an addict over and over again. I dont trust myself even though I have all the factual data now.

Something that is unlikely to happen with most forms of cardio since most of them use your calvesYou are correct that as more fat burns away they will slim down but unfortunately if theyre as muscular as you say youre stuck with them.  Calves are one of the hardest muscles to get to increase in size as their shape is largely determined the length of the ligaments they attach to.  Many body builders struggle with the exact opposite problem that you have.,loseit,daldnwb,1,t5_2rz8w

9819266,0,t3_5fmxxj,Late last year I wanted to quit smoking but knew if I did it as a New Years resolution Id be highly likely to fail just like every other year. So I quit in late November and have just ticked over  months without a single cigarette since I put out my last one. This year Im taking the same approach after many years of needing to do something about my weight I started in early November by cutting out snacks only drinking water and really paying attention to what I was putting in my body and logging everything on MFP. Sure its not prefect but its a hell of a way better than it was. This week I made the next and probably one of the biggest steps in my journey and joined a gym. The fear and anxiety of walking in one has held be back for my whole life but its now or never.

Because it is literally the only way to make your body resort to using fat for energy.They hide it couch it twist it but every single diet that has ever worked did so by creating an energy imbalance that forced the body to use fat to make up for a caloric deficit.Sometimes thats what is successful for a person rules that they can follow unfortunately most of them wind up being unsustainable.,loseit,daonns8,3,t5_2rz8w

9880485,0,t3_5gs891,Depression makes it very hard I know from experience. The illness itself makes it really hard to seek help or make improvements and fucks your judgment and sense of self worth  Besides therapy or antidepressants other approaches that help are basically lifestyle ones. Cut down on alcohol or ditch it altogether it is a depressant regular exercise eating better sleeping consistently. Its a bit of a virtuous cycle as better diet and exercise help you sleep and better sleep makes a HUGE difference to overall health and wellbeing. It can be hard to just overhaul your entire lifestyle Im not suggesting that. Part of your brain is very resistant to change especially more exercise and different food.The approach I took was to identify small positive changes to ease myself into new habits and avoid that mental backlash. So you could commit to  minutes a day just turning the pedals on your exercise bike. So easy it feels pointless but its no great sacrifice either. When youre ready ramp it up a little  go a bit faster go five minutes longer.Food wise you could aim to cook at home twice a week. It doesnt have to be healthy just not takeaway.On that note supermarkets are crammed with foods that keep well in cupboards or freezers. If you gradually move towards cooking more at home youll get more for your money with regard to grocery shopping and your bank balance will be better off!

9891698,0,t3_5h14c2,Almonds are deceptive theyre so little but so calorie dense. For example I have preweighed cal baggies of raw almonds I take to work for snacking and I highly doubt theres less than  almonds in the bag. Same goes for cheese and butter. You estimate at  calories but unless youre eating tiny tiny portions at dinner I think you must not actually be eating that little.I also read in the comments that you allow yourself cheat days currently  a week. You havent mentioned what you eat on a cheat day which makes things more difficult to troubleshoot. But lets try.I plugged your stats into a TDEE calculator. Your maintenance calories to neither gain nor lose weight would be day and to lose lbweek you would eat day since youre shorter this should be fine.This would be  calories per week to maintain your current weight. Say that  days of the week you stick to your normal meal plan and lets estimate that its actually around  calories thats  calories for those  days. That leaves  calories for the other  days for you to cheat with before you eat over maintenance  or about  calories per cheat day less if your normal meal plan is actually higher in calories. Looks like a lot but depending on what you eat on a cheat day it wouldnt be hard to reach. For example a footlong chicken and bacon ranch melt at Subway is about  calories  nearly half your day in one sandwich.Im sure if you tracked what you eat on your cheat days youd probably find that when taken into the larger context of your week youre actually eating close to maintenance which is why you havent seen any weight loss yet. It may also explain why you dont feel hungry on the days you only eat  or so calories since youre still getting the calories on other days your body doesnt reset at midnight after all. I used to eat like that  wouldnt eat much most days of the week and never felt hungry but would eat a lot on the other days.So Id say start tracking your calories as accurately as possible with a food scale preferably stop having cheat days or at least track them if you do and try to eat around  calories a day. You can adjust your other days if you do have a cheat day and end up going over but try not to get into the habit of constantly borrowing calories from other days if its going to make you hungrier. If it helps maybe try to reach a weekly calorie goal of  calories rather than a daily goal of .,loseit,dawwti5,2,t5_2rz8w

I was very comfortable being a tomboy I still am. I made a deal with myself though that once I hit a certain weight Id try on a skirt and a dress. They looked so good I bought them both. I certainly raised a few eyebrows from people who know me the first time I wore them totally worth it though.

9931316,0,t3_5hq1h9,Instead of ruminating on that sadness and getting worked up about it acknowledge it then let it go. Its just a feeling and it wont hurt you. Youre not a wrong or bad person for having a feeling. Youll live through having a bad feeling your weight loss is not affected by having a bad feeling. Stop giving your bad feelings power your actions and thoughts are your power. Then try challenging those negative thoughts to begin separating the act of eating from the negative emotion. You know your body needs fuel and nourishment so you can be active and make other good decisions to support your weight loss. Remind yourself of that. It can be as simple as keeping a note on your phone or in your pocket that you glance at before meals or anytime you start thinking you should undereat to make progress.,loseit,db22q8a,2,t5_2rz8w

9945151,0,t3_5hxubf,Hello! Im sorry you have to have surgery I had surgery in February May and October of . To say this year has been a struggle would be a serious understatement.  Like you I gained a little bit of weight about  lbs during the first six months due to the immobility and the depression caused by pain.Literally the only thing in my  years on this earth that has motivated me to lose weight is pain.  I have failed plenty of times before and it was because I didnt want it enough to remain disciplined.It looks like I will continue to have pain for the rest of my life but I am determined to weigh as little as I can while still being healthy so I dont contribute to that pain by being overweight. That motivation was what I needed to make the changes and form the discipline that has gotten me this far. Good luck with the surgery and weight loss.

9950263,0,t3_5hwqlf,First off congratulations! My story is similar to yours. Though Im two years past where youre at. Similar heights and weights and reasons. If you dont mind Ill rant some thoughts.Once your baby is here exercising that much is tough especially because of lack of sleep affecting recovery. I recommend watching diet while still in pregnancy so youre used to calorie counting by the time the baby comes. Id highly recommend the gym membership. I have a home gym treadmill elliptical power rack full dumbbell set etc. And I still pay for a membership. Sometimes you just need variety. That said being able to workout with baby is great. Get a jogging stroller. Mine is not so its rough past  mph. Great way to give mom a break while hitting your goals. Also its great for your kids to see you enjoy exercise.Take some progress shots with your wife as she gets more pregnant. Then joke about her getting your weight. Do the pictures. Buy dont say that.Blow your diet while in the hospital after delivery. My first child I followed diet strictly. My second I ate fried chicken every night. Negligible difference but much better experience.Holding a baby really hurts the back after a while. Work that out.Apparently you cant put creatine in a babys formula so whatever. The gains will have to wait for your little one.Establish some air tight tasty eating out food. The closer you get to delivery the more tired you will be and especially right after. Fast food is amazing so be prepped. I think the single thought that has helped me the most with my weight loss was the thought No matter how had I was yesterday I can still lose the same amount today. Chances are youll have terrible days where you dont work out and you dont eat right and with a definitive deadline of baby due date in your head it can trip a lot of people up. Just keep moving forward. No matter how long it takes. You will get the results you want.Take this opportunity to give up alcohol if your drink. Make it seem altruistic since mom cant drink. But hey alcohol is wasted cals.If you have any questions diet exercise kids sanity feel free to reach out. Good luck and congrats again!,loseit,db4jmvm,2,t5_2rz8w

9953889,0,t3_5i171i,Well I cut it out because I was too broke to buy it very often. But thats hopefully not your problem. Id say start by decreasing how much you drink.

9955380,0,t3_5i3wbt,Apples and oranges bro. CICO and Keto are not comparable. You can do CICO alone literally just counting calories and eating whatever. You can do CICO and Keto eating a ketogenic diet while counting calories. You can just do Keto just eating a ketogenic diet. CICO is about food amount. Keto is about food selection.If you put fewer calories into your body than you use you will lose weight. Thats what CICO is all about.Food selection Keto or otherwise can impact your health and weight loss but not in the straightforward way that CICO does. If you are eating a high fiber and high protein diet youre probably going to feel less hungry. Keto may be one way of achieving this high fiberprotein diet thus causing you to feel less hungry. So even if youre not tracking calories your Keto diet may make you less hungry and as a result you may consume less calories than you use. However there is no guarantee that you will consume less calories than you use unless you make a conscious effort to do so. The way you make that conscious effort is by using CICO.,loseit,db57lua,6,t5_2rz8w

9970789,0,t3_5id1vc,A lot of people say you need to exercise for  minutes at a moderate pace. For me that is too much time and I dont have that kind of stamina at this point. Im too big to run but I will do very intense intervals for about  to  minutes on my machine of choice. This means that I make it so hard that I can barely breathe and hold it as long as I can. I will turn the intensity way down and work my way back up to that intensity. I usually do  to  sets of high intensity bouts in the  to  minutes of exercise. Not only is this more time efficient but HIIT boosts your metabolism for the rest of the day so you burn more calories. I feel that I have a lot of energy too.,loseit,db77yhg,2,t5_2rz8w

We sum it up to eat less move more because thats the one common trait successful stories all have. Mostly the eat less.The thing is when a person asks How do I lose weight? they arent giving out their life details. How can anyone expect to come up with a tailored plan given that little information? Is he suggesting that we start with all those personal questions that people may or may not want to answer or even answer truthfully?Obesity isnt a problem people can solve for someone else.

I am weak to many foods and I have been consistently better at not eating the food that I dont stand in front of and look at.Recommendation Dont keep PB in the house. Its easier not to crave foods that you allow access to in moderation. Moderate access to pizza will stop me going pizzacrazed. Turkey sausages are lower calorie than pork sausages and I can have three upfront instead of sobbing quietly over a single pork sausage then stealing extra.Recommendation Allow yourself access to PB in situations where you will be able to eat less of it than you normally would. Its interesting what you can mask by blaming your poor diet on your love of certain foods. I may be weak to crisps and chocolate and cheese and candy but my consistent consumption of extra portions of food and taking large portions of my meals are all to blame as well.Recommendation You may love PB but what else is going on in your diet? Investigate the big picture of how you live.,loseit,dbdlnsb,1,t5_2rz8w

10032036,0,t1_dbf4efm,gt I feel crappy tired sore and hungry most of the time. I thought this was just part of losing weight. Oh Im so sorry. No no my friend. Thats not what its about at all. There is this image in the populations eye of what a diet should be. That image is of people slaving their way through dull meals of chicken and broccoli and brown rice hitting the gym and being miserable and repentant for having got so fat in the first place.That image is a lie. You do not have to be miserable. You do not have to be tired or sore or hungry. Your inflexibility is keeping you safe right now. You are protecting yourself from change for having to step out into a wide world of food choice from having to put your will to the test. How do you plan to live once you reach your goal weight? Will you continue to eat the same meals do the same workout routine cheat the same cheats? More than anything my advice to you is to learn to live how you truly WANT to live. Learn flexibility learn how to eat food eat balanced in a way which benefit your long term goals. This doesnt have to be a misery. It doesnt have to be so hard.you probably get this a lot but may I recommend you use an online app like MFP? Ive tried tracking calories my own way before and sure it brings flexibility in terms of reporting. But... on the downside it makes learning how to eat in day to day life tough because you either eat the same crap over and over again or you spend hours going over calorie values and calculations. I feel like your tracking is way more difficult than it should be and probably not as accurate as it could be.,loseit,dbf78xj,1,t5_2rz8w

10044534,0,t3_5jk2pc,Im not sure if someone has already given you an answer but I make a batch of these every week ham egg and cheese lite english muffins. It requires  eggs pretty cheap imo  slices of ham  slices of cheese  thomas lite english muffins. I havent done the math to work it all out but none of those seem particularly expensive to me considering you get  meals out of it!What I do is crack one egg into each hole of a  hole muffin tin thats been sprayed with Pam. Sprinkle some salt and pepper on your eggs for extra flavor! You can use jumbo sized eggs to make it even more filling. Bake at  for about  minutes. Let them cool completely.Then assemble your sandwiches. English muffin I do untoasted personally ham egg cheese on top maybe a squirt of sriracha if thats your thing. Wrap it up in aluminum foil and pop them in the freezer. They stay good in the freezer for about  months but I eat them within  days lol.They are about  calories and you just have to wrap them in a paper towel and nuke them for about . minutes to eat. I rarely get tired of these but I also do breakfast burritos. I use Ole Xtreme Fitness High Fiber Low Carb tortillas  only  cals per tortilla. Again  eggs Shredded cheese onionspeppers and breakfast sausage.Just scramble the eggs set aside to cool. Cook the sausage set aside to cool. Dice the onions and peppers sautee with some spices set aside to cool. Assemble your burritos and add a little cheese. Roll up in aluminum foil and put in the freezer! Same deal with heating them up. Wrap in a paper towel about microwave for about . minutes. These are about  cals. Again Im sorry I dont have a cost per unit. But I know eggs are dirt cheap breakfast sausage is a cheaper protein especially store brand onions and peppers are super cheap especially in bulk. The tortillas and cheese...Im honestly not sure.I guess I would recommend shopping at Sams Club or Costco if you can buying veggies in bulk and finding creative ways to liven up cheaper meals.

10073788,0,t1_dbkml2z,It takes time to start seeing consistent weight loss on the scale. Weighing yourself twice a day is not going to give you any valuable info. Two cups of water will throw your weight up by a pound which is more than you should expect to lose in a day. Food will do the same. If youre having trouble keeping the average consider aiming for a consistent daily calorie intake. I find that if I increase my deficit too much Ill binge after a few days. You eventually hit a point of severe diminishing returns where the extra scant calories cut isnt remotely worth the struggle to keep the deficit going. ,loseit,dbkmxiu,1,t5_2rz8w

10120455,0,t3_5krids,The really annoying thing about your weight is that you can eat all healthy exercise and sleep well on a particular day yet at the end of the day you look in the mirror  still fat. Demotivating isnt it?On the other hand there are plenty of things I can fix in just one maybe a couple of days. Get rid of the jungle growing on the lower part of my body completely change my wardrobe clean the entire house get a completely different hairstyle ...Well to me what really helps is to trick myself into thinking I can fix my weight in each day. I try to act like skinny people act every day. I wake up and say if I do this day as I should I will be skinny all day. I make myself a fancy green salad. I take the time and do my makeup when I feel like it. I go out shopping for pretty clothes. When I get hungry I go for the hipster new juice bar that just opened in the shopping center. If you are already skinny and fit you are very motivated to take care of yourself every day. Not just healthwise but treating yourself to some new clothes or vacations trips to other countries going to museums movie night getting together with friends and all that jazz.I know this sounds really weird but this is what works for me.Also another thing find something to obsess over when you are having one of those I want to eat but I shouldnt moments. Sometimes I watch vloggers on youtube who are fit and healthy as hell and get inspired. Sometimes I watch cooking shows. Sometimes that makes me want to eat more and I watch other random shit. Sometimes I read mean comments about fat people on rfatlogic here and that helps. Sometimes I watch fat people doing mukbangs on youtube and the whole Im so much better than that! feeling kicks in.

I am looking to get back in shape before my July weddinghoneymoon. If I start with eating strictly  calories a day will I still lose weight? Or is  calories a day to maintain weight? Once again sorry if this is a stupid question just trying to save myself   months of hell. ,loseit,dbvbd5u,3,t5_2rz8w

I want to pratice forms for at least half an hour each day. Also on the weight loss front I just want to keep it simple any continous loss is a positive but going below kg would be really nice. Im also going to continue doing little experiments with nutrition and IF tweaking things just a little bit a times to see what works best. Good luck to all of us. ,loseit,dbvbpsc,2,t5_2rz8w
10158717,0,t1_dbuwrr1,Thank you. Wow Im sorry about the binge eating. I know how tough that can be I suffered from it BADLY. I dont know if it would help but check out Josie Spinardis book on Amazon she saved my life and I no longer binge. The medication as a cause is interesting I never knew they could have those side effects. I would still encourage you to believe that is in your hands though because it is even though the chemical shifts can make it SO hard sometimes. I read a study about obese people that they split into two groups. One group was told that their weight was due to a medical condition and the other was told it was behavioral. at the end of the study they found that the medical condition group ate MUCH more calories than the group who was told that their excess weight was due to behavioral conditions. I just wanted to add this in because I know that with my binge eating and night eating pathologizing it even though there are probably underlying issues makes the behavior worse. I know that at the end of the day I am the one putting spoon to mouth. Thank you for the part on travel. I was actually thinking about that the other day. Its very possible that the airplane ride acts as a major stressor for me. ,loseit,dbvjpfw,1,t5_2rz8w
10160656,0,t3_5l677k,Hi! Im a  year old female  and weigh  lbs.  was a great year and I married my best friend in August. I dieted the first  months of the year and got down to lbs but after the wedding I fell off. I was so tired of the stress and pressure of losing weight for the wedding that after the wedding I stopped tracking and ate whatever I wanted and not in moderation. Im ready to get back on track.

10162259,0,t1_dbvhq2g,I appreciate what you are saying and respect that you opinion on this is different from mine.  However there is no changing my mind on how I feel about this. There is a time and a place for socialization to the extent I am talking about and one of those times and places is not at a populated gym. I mean it would be rude if they were standing around blocking traffic in a supermarket aisle doing the same thing. If you are in the way and being obnoxiously loud in public it is generally considered poor behavior. Id judge it that way regardless of if it is in the gym or not. If I was doing the same thing Id expect to be judged for it as well  because it is rude and shows that you do not respect other peoples time or space. So its really not a gym thing as much as it is a life thing. Just because a gym should be a safe space from judgement doesnt dismiss the every day rules of etiquette either. ,loseit,dbvy5ld,1,t5_2rz8w

10167303,0,t3_5ll34u,When I was  my weight reached what I considered to be really fat at the time lbs. Im  and a female with a nice figure suits me fine but I dont look willowy or anything like that. I was active and felt that I could eat pretty much whatever I wanted and not gain weight. I got back under  and thought to myself theres no way Ill ever let myself get that fat again. I also questioned why people allowed themselves to get fat when I would read weight loss message boards at the time SELF and weight watchers forums. The truth is life and shit happens. Some people are more aesthetically focused so maybe you wont ever gain weight like others. I have long hair a pretty face sorry for the brag and like to dress in cute clothes so it was easier for me to not worry about gaininglosing a couple of pounds here and there because it didnt change how other people interacted with me. Then I went through an extremely depressingshitty period in life and my weight went from about  to . I avoided the mirrors I didnt get in any group photos or allow others to take photos of me and I didnt go out as much. I became more of a hermit until I decided to take control again and got back to it. But its not something to judge or look down for others. We can all use a little work and rest assured theres something going on in your life that others would be scratching their heads at too. ,loseit,dbwipxe,3,t5_2rz8w

10185821,0,t3_5lox40,I have a Fitbit flex that I got for  on Craigslist last February. At first I thought it would be a good reminder to get me to walk more but at that point in time I wasnt really serious and eventually i just ignored it and let it live on my wrist. Last month I had a turning  point and started tracking my intake and using my Fitbit to track my calories burned.  I think its worth it and Ive been considering getting an upgrade.I really like my fitbit. I find it helpful and I dont feel the need to use other tracking apps for weightloss. The problem with these things is that people can end up feeling like just wearing it is going to do the trick but its not. Its not going to get you up off of the couch thats all on you. It is a simple tool to help you track your activity levels more accurately. Instead of putting your info into a calculator and saying that your lifestyle is sedentary vs active the fitness tracker figures that out for you and adjusts accordingly. I prefer it because some days I can be very active and others I do absolutely nothing at all and with my Fitbit I know how it all adds up at the end of the day.,loseit,dbymaoo,2,t5_2rz8w

Sadly I just came down with a massive head cold and will probably be postponing my target dieting until Im feeling less awful.That said heres the usual information! Im a  woman and I currently weigh about  lbs. I never focused on dieting and my weight because I would maintain at  lbs no matter what I did how much I exercised or what I ate. I even maintained throughout college which included multiple bouts of depression and a ton of unhealthy eating.My job was really difficult for the first six months  I had a four hour commute daily to and from work which made exercising nearly impossible  and I ended up taking anxiety medicine. These two factors combined led to my first major weight gain ever. I want to get back down to my starting weight and if I can continue maybe even to . Since I moved to my current apartment Ive been eating pretty consistently healthily with about  cheat meals per week. I recently embraced exercising regularly about  times a week for an hour each day in the hopes that it would bring down my weight again. Since it didnt clearly its time to start dieting. I dont have a ton of knowledge on the subject since Im new to this but Im hoping a  calorie diet will help immensely.,loseit,dbz0imv,1,t5_2rz8w

10198479,0,t1_dbzqlca,I think before you can maintain a high level of discipline you build up by improving your discipline one small step at a time. Discipline becomes easy when its second nature and if you have a habit of not following your own discipline it would take tremendous willpower just to overcome. That also has its disadvantages as if your willpower completely fades you might just go back to how you were before.Building up discipline amounts to maintaining a certain discipline each day. And once youve maintained your discipline while improving it over time maintaining a high level of discipline eventually becomes second nature. You dont need to rely on sheer willpower to be discipline.I had just read a post about discipline a day or two ago but I cant seem to find it.,loseit,dc01yr1,1,t5_2rz8w

10228261,0,t3_5m9cob,Yesterday I managed to eat  calories under despite going to Mexican food. Im still not sure I believe what MFP is telling m there  I had chicken tamales a bunch of chips and salsa and I picked the higher calorie options for tamales because I cant obviously know for sure. Also do you know how tedious counting every single chip you eat is? I would just grab like  at a time and put them on a napkin. By the time I finished eating I felt like I was going to burst also didnt help that I chugged a ton of water!. I couldnt eat anything else for the rest of the night. In retrospect the meal was  calories total alone. I guess that makes sense? Usually I have an easier time eating that much though. Anyway Im not sure whats up this week. Last two weeks have been calorie hell due to my two holiday cheat days. This week Im like  calories under almost every day. I think I realized why. Im quitting smoking weed for the month as a tolerance break not really for weight loss reasons because Im not willing to fully sacrifice ALL of my vices just yet. Thats making me eat less.  But I think the side effect is that Im hoarding my calories more than I need to. Originally I was eating  calorie breakfast and lunches then going on a walk saving  calories for dinner and evening munchies. That way if I smoked I could eat a lot and be satisfied without going over sometimes I still did P. Now thats just not necessary and Im not eating nearly as much and get full from smaller meals. I think I should stop doing that because Im already eating at a lb per week deficit and I dont want to starve myself or lose weight too quickly. ,loseit,dc3fikc,1,t5_2rz8w

I took today as a rest day which Fridays are often a weight lifting day. Well didnt do it.

10241315,0,t3_5mm67m,We dont get what we want or deserve.We get what we ask for and expect.ampnbspIt sounds like you expect to fail.As long as you keep expecting that you probably will.Youll keep going into it halfheartedly and then just take a ride on the bandwagon for a little while until you choose to accidentally fall off again.ampnbspI used to do that.Dieting almost became a lifestyle and I never actually expected to reach my goal again. Like you I reached it once or twice but didnt maintain.What changed? I stopped being afraid of failure. I failed so many times.  I started looking at failure as just a mistake I made that I could learn to prevent in the future. I wrote down the reason for the mistake and how I would keep from making the same mistake again. I started implementing habits. Instead of just doing the same thing over and over that was doomed to fail I chose to start changing how I feel about things. I started working on how I feel about exercising. How I feel about healthy foods. I made exercise so easy that it was impossible to fail... Same for eating veggies. Learned to implement habits using this book for example. I stopped quitting. I got so tired of the mental energy it took every time I had given up to try to get back into it. So I just stopped giving up.     If I overate today I start again today. Not tomorrow not Monday. I log everything I ate to the best of my ability. You have to stop rewarding yourself for failing. Even if you fail everything still continues as always... ampnbspYou could start by Writing down your past mistakes and how to prevent each of them from happening again this time. Implementing a simple habit that you do every day after you wake up. For example if you want to take up yoga just have a yoga mat by your bed and do one sun salutation every morning. Keep it so easy that you never have a reason not to do it. In time it gets under your skin and you become better and better at keeping your promises to yourself. A mistake doesnt mean you are allowed to quit. Mistakes are part of the journey. When something comes up and you go off your diet so what? As soon as that something is done you log the food you ate honestly and completely and you are still on track.    Stop giving yourself a reward for failing... One mistake doesnt mean everything is over and its okay to go completely nuts.,loseit,dc4wrxk,2,t5_2rz8w

10248252,0,t1_dc5mu80,I believe I was eating well enough last time I tried from memory I was using the stone soup meal plans which consisted of a lot of poached eggs kale and asparagus during the day a very gross cauliflower salad one day and then never again and very little meat. Ive never been a snack person i do keep emergency jelly beans for when I Do get funny though but it isnt always I eat usually two meals  breakfast and dinner though sometimes I notice Im hungry between those times it is usually just an hour before dinner so its easy to ignore with a cup of mint tea. Portion wise my portions are smaller than the rest of my family but they eat quite a lot so that mightnt be saying a lot. My weakness one of them is that I struggle to drink water I need to mix cordial through it because the taste without it freaks me out  for complicated reasons connected to my childhood faulty water tank and sooo many dead frogs.

10262052,0,t1_dc7813w,So Im disabled have chronic pain and some autoimmune problems and Ive seen a lot of doctors in my life many of whom have told me I need to lose weight. Most of those doctors without even asking what I was eating told me to stop drinking soda. Not super helpful since I didnt even drink soda until a couple years ago when I started doing diet. Others acted like because I was young all I needed to do was join a sport and get outside more ignoring the obvious problems presented by my chronic pain.It all kind of boils down to one thing for me. I want a doctor who listens to me when I tell them whats wrong and who believes me when I tell them what Im already doing. I want someone who understands that I may need to start out much slower than someone my age without chronic pain problems when it comes to exercising and who can help me work up to that.If someone had just sat me down and explained how to get started with CICO I think I would have put in the effort to lose weight much sooner than I did.,loseit,dc79cng,7,t5_2rz8w

If you dont want to be skinnyfat youll need some strength training both at a deficit and at a surplus calorie wise.gtI only do cardio and dont feel like lifting till I get lean bodyfat is this reasonable?No the video explains how you will continue to lose muscle mass along with fat as your BF stays roughly the same.  Youll become a smaller skinnyfat but still skinny fat.gtI was on a relatively moderatelarge deficit probably around  deficit throughout the whole time of losing weight should I up this?No you should decrease it.

10299163,0,t3_5nbjk7,There seem to be mixed results its already established that in most patients short term use of an SSRI suppresses acyl ghrelin production. The few studies that followed relatively long term users of SSRIs found that appetite had increased over time and pointed to long term weight gain. It seems as though a lot of it is still up in the air. I recently got off of Prozac after  years on it because I gained  lbs. From totally nonscientific personal experience I did notice that I had trouble for the first time in my life with not feeling fullcraving food even though I wasnt hungry following the initial weight loss of  lbs. When I asked my doctor about it when I quit in November she said that serotonin can cause ghrelin production to be altered and could potentially cause you to not have the full feeling you usually would. Judging from a lot of the stuff I just read it seems as though it just depends on the individual.Sources could only get Abstracts on someComparing different SSRIs over the relative long term More of the same Comparison between different classes Just a mention that it is a known side effect but focus is on side effect management So apparently this is a bit of a paradox Potential for a different kind of long term Classes compared  Ultimately it seems as though there are still breakthroughs to be made on the subject of appetite and antidepressants in general. ,loseit,dcbgs43,1,t5_2rz8w

10334911,0,t3_5ntk7y,So I sometimes graze while marking student work high school teacher and while studyingdoing assignments masters student. Not the best habit and not something I do every day but it is what it is  it helps me to stay on task on the days where otherwise Id need a break every five minutes. I cant do it in the library because many of my foods of choice are noisy. I like veggie sticks  carrot celery baby cucumber and capsicum beef jerky tea coffee and soda water apple slices berries or other precut fruit hard boiled eggs and sometimes almonds or macadamias cheese salami or a single wrapped piece of dark chocolate but these choices are rare for me because of their calorie density  Id rather eat these when I can savor them. I weigh and measure before I start working I pack a lunchbox with lots of little bagscontainers if Im working away from home so I know how much to track and will do this instead of a meal or with a very light meal following so I still fit within my daily goals. Yes you should try to develop better habits  healthier choices are a step in the right direction. Yes ideally youll get rid of the need to snack altogether while studying. But if you cant avoid this all the time make sure to choose well and perhaps think about whether you should be framing it as a meal rather than as an addon.,loseit,dcfiq9t,2,t5_2rz8w

I like to think Im fooling my body into thinking well end all this dieting with a huge pizza party. Haha. Jokes on you body! Id also suggest double checking your portions if I get in a roll with some of the same foods I sometimes lose track of my portion control. Whip out the food scale for a day or two. My morning muesli was nearly double the calories I had been tracking when I actually weighed it. Lastly try changing some things up new workout for a few days or some really different types of foods.

10356548,0,t3_5ob8p7,Its a fairly common occurrence for weight loss to occur after a higher calorie day. Eating at a calorie deficit can be considered a stressful state for the body. This can cause an increase in cortisol the stress hormone which leads to increased water retention in some people. After a day of higher eating the hormone goes down and the extra water weight is released. This is what causes the scale weight to go down.Note that this is not starvation mode or anything like that. Its just one of many factors that feeds into a persons always varying water weight.Alternatively if your  calorie day involved alcohol you may just be dehydrated which also  less water weight.,loseit,dchz418,6,t5_2rz8w

Keep it simple keep it zen ampnbspIn practice this means Read about TDEE in the FAQ and learn to calculate yours then eat  or  less than that a day. To know how much you ate use an app that calculates it for you when you scan the bar code.When you stumble when you make a mistake log the mistake too and just keep going.

Ive noticed that when other people close to me are dismissive towards my goals or processes I start acting dismissive my goals too. Really watch out for that his opinions do not need to be your opinions and from what Ive read here a ton of his opinions are flat out wrong. The reality is that it IS working! Nothing about your post suggests that it isnt helping you lose weight. You need to focus less on what other people say about how youre doing things if it is obviously working or else surround yourself with people more willing to look at things differently. Dont let anyone invalidate your success ever ever ever. You do not need to agree with how he does things. I would set a boundary about what he says about your weight loss process. Tell him that you would rather he not make negative comments about what youre doing and that you would appreciate him keeping those opinions to himself. Then hold him to it  if he says something that makes you feel sad or angry you tell him that what he said wasnt welcome and you keep telling him every time. Dont let him make excuses or act defensive you deserve this. If he cant even keep it to himself when you casually mention how many calories are in something stop talking about it entirely. Find someone who supports your process like a friend or family member who you can rant and rave to about this topic. I know its hard to confront an SO sometimes I was always scared of being dumped but you being true to yourself is worth more than any relationship ever could be and if he really loves you and cares hell respect your wishes. And this isnt just about weight loss its about him respecting you and honoring you for who you are not who he wants you to be. Best of luck friend and please dont stop what youre doing. I hope that my real talk doesnt come off as mean  Ive just dealt with similar kinds of nonsense from people before. Im still dealing with standing up for myself and how I do things to this day. ,loseit,dcot0kk,1,t5_2rz8w

Add some lemon juice salt pepper onion and garlic powder cumin and cayenne pepper and mash it all up. So many flavors some health fats lots of fiber and a little bit of protein.

10428518,0,t3_5pbwq6,Generally speaking people burn fewer calories through exercise than they think.  If you have been going to the gym regularly for some time your body constitution may have changed somewhat your fitness level has changed too so when you do lose the weight you will look all the better for it   However without counting calories you have not lost the fat covering your muscles yet and this is probably why you cannot see a difference.Ultimately the weight loss will be down to diet.  I am  inch taller and  pounds heavier than you and at our weight in order to lose lb a week we need to be eating around  calories a day.  Unfortunately this means being really strict with calorie counting because even small mistakes can really throw us off course.I also hate looking in the mirror and feel fat disgusting etc even though everyone is praising my weight loss and saying how much better I look.  Meanwhile I feel even worse because it just draws attention to how grotesque I must have looked when I was lbs.  Truth is it takes time to adjust to the new you and when you look at yourself every day it is harder to see progress compared to people who only see you every couple of months and would notice a difference.,loseit,dcq53i5,1,t5_2rz8w

10444974,0,t3_5pj3on,What it is that you find unattractive seems important in this sitution. For me personally it would me hard to be on the same page. After seeing my own improvements with weight loss I would have a hard time understanding the lack of desire to be healthy. So the laziness although Im sure we can all agree that theres more to the mindset than that would be a challenge for me to accept. The weight itself wouldnt be a deal breaker for me but WHY the weight is there might. I want to grow with someone. I want to be a progressive team. I would feel like Id lost that aspect of the relationship making intimacy less satisfying. Im seeing this through my own experiences though I suppose. My husband is underweight and trying to gain while I lose. Ive gained  lbs since we met. Even at my smallest I outweighed him. He weighed  at . I was  at . But weve always been each others health advocate and very involved in each others goals. Always supported one another here and losing this would be devistating to me.

10471413,0,t1_dcv0t9e,Yep its actually something I wish more significantly overweight people knew  you have a huge advantage over someone whos just lbs overweight. Every bit of exercise you do burns WAY more calories than them and your BMR is skyhigh to begin with... People are taught to think that the heavier they are the harder it is to lose weight but my experience has been the opposite... the lighter you get the more you notice the work! This is really helpful when youre just starting off because you have so far to go but the road is so easy in the beginning. Youre not starting off climbing Mount Everest youre starting off with a leisurely stroll on the flat which only begins to incline gradually. By the time you reach the mountain youre so much better prepared  youre used to counting the calories youre starting to have a good understanding of how different proportions of macros affect you youve accumulated all sorts of tips amp tricks for the style of eating that suits you volume vs. high density eating for example and exercise becomes possible without hurting yourself. ,loseit,dcv1j8z,11,t5_2rz8w

10482769,0,t3_5numnl,Hi! Sorry I am a little late to this but I just came across your question and think I might be able to help. First of all  congratulations on your weight loss! That is a huge accomplishment and I bet youre ready to get started on the next chapter of your life  I recommend doing a couple of things. Check RealSelf  I linked you to the Mommy Makeover page. Here you can learn a little more about the procedure read some real patient reviews and check out questions that other prospective patientscurrent patientspast patients have had. This will be an excellent source of information for you and if youre so inclined you can create a free account and ask any questions that you have to real doctors.. Start bookmarking some surgeons in your area. The key to this one will be to check boardcertification. I cannot stress this enough! Make sure your surgeon is certified by American Society of Plastic Surgeons and American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery I linked you to both of the search tools. This basically just means that your doctor has gone through the rigorous training to provide their patients safe and natural results. If you find a few surgeons who you think would be a good fit for you you can make appointments for consultation and that brings me to my next point. Make sure youre comfortable with your doctor. During your consultation is the time to ask any and ALL questions that youve ever wanted to know about your surgery your surgeon and hisher past surgeries. Something that I recommend highly is to check out beforeandafter photos so you get an idea of their experience and style of surgery. Most doctors will have a bampa gallery NSFW  medical nudity on their site so you can get an idea beforehand. However inperson photos are just as important. Get to know your surgeon make sure that YOU feel comfortable and dont be afraid to ask questions. This is the time to get to know your potential surgeon. Mommy makeover surgery is a very big surgery lifechanging even and youll want to make sure that youre  confident and comfortable with your doctor. Scheduling your consultation will probably be the biggest leap in this process and they will be able to take over in the prep department that youre asking about. Even though its early in the process you will be able to do the necessary research to set up a solid foundation for the next steps. Good luck to you! ,loseit,dcwbw8w,2,t5_2rz8w

10486156,0,t1_dcvwud2,No that makes total sense. A few things  I get that someone would not want to give up meat because of taste. I like the taste of fried chicken not gonna lie. Big Macs? Yummy. A lot of vegetariansvegans criticize people just for liking the taste of meat which is INCREDIBLY hypocritical in my opinion because deep down the majority of them like the taste or used to like it. Thats why the faux meat industry is growing so rapidly right now.   Youre right there are a lot of nutrients in meat that are found in lower concentrations in plants. However there are a lot of nutrients in plants that are completely or almost completely missing in meat. The nutrient density of plants is generally far higher than meat. ANDI food scores is a good list to look up for nutrient density of foods. The first meat on that list is ranked th in terms of nutrient density and that is shrimp.   In addition you have to look at it as protein per calorie. We all have to eat a certain number of calories whether it be from plants or animals. Sure your steak might have more protein than my beans but youll also be able to eat a lot less of it than I will of my beans otherwise youll gain weight. In terms of protein per calories tofu beans lowfat yogurt lowfat milksoy milkalmond milk eggs nuts and seeds are all in the top  and are all vegetarian foods. So basically I can eat the same amount in terms of calories of lowfat cheese or tofu as you can of meat and get the same amount of or even more protein and other nutrients.   Any nutrient that might still be missing after you eat your veggies can easily be made up for with faux meats and soyalmond milk which have very similar nutrient profiles to their real counterparts although this is usually not necessary.   Plant foods eliminate the bad stuff. All of the bad things that are present in meat are usually not present in plants. Have you ever heard of spinach being high in saturated and trans fat? No but meat is especially processed meat. Too much cholesterol in those tomatoes? No but again theres a lot of it in meat.  Meat and dairy even though vegetarians still eat dairy are linked to much higher rates of heart disease and cancer. This is especially true for processed meats which are now a category  carcinogen. There is even some sort of campaign going on right now to put warning labels on processed meats. Red meats are category  but thats still significant compared to vegetables which if anything protect against cancer. Forks over Knives is a really good documentary to watch about this although I have to warn you some of the recommendations are a bit extreme so follow the advice in moderation.   Consider the other consequences of the meat industry such as the vast amount of water wasted the pollution and its detrimental effects on fighting global poverty etc.   Im not trying to demonize meat here. Personally I think that eating some fish here and there is very healthy if it is unprocessed. It contains omegas is rich in protein etc. However given current evidence the general consensus in the healthnutrition community right now is that a plantbased diet with the occasional portion of fish or lean white meat is the healthiest is most strongly linked to longevity and is most protective against heart disease and cancer.Im not saying everyone should raid their freezers throw out all their meat and become vegan right this instant. Im just saying that eating more veggies eating less meat and choosing fishwhite meat over processedred meat is the healthier and more sustainable way to eat. Sorry for the long spiel.  Do those reasons make sense to you?,loseit,dcwpqzq,1,t5_2rz8w

Throughout the s plank your goal is hold your abdomen tight like youre prepped to get kicked in the stomach.  max squeeze. Not just the front. Think about engaging the entire abdominal belt front sides and back. Its easy to want to hold your breath BUT MAINTAIN AN OPEN AIRWAY. Even if theyre short choppy breaths.

10537742,0,t3_5qundn,If it does make you feel better eating right through caloric restriction will definitely be the most beneficial to your weight loss anyways. Running vigorously at  Kmph is good and will help to maintain the weight loss but you are going to for sure be hungrier later in the day due to such a large caloric deficit. Also youre turning this inwards quite a bit. Sometimes life takes a while to work out and has its dark parts but they usually help form the person and create a learning experience others will never have.  Remember to keep a realistic goal and stick to that. Chances are you will find a girlfriend outside of exercising and that person should like you for who you are not for superficial reasons. tldr those people at the gym suck dont let them get you down life will work out for you and good luck at the upcoming half marathon! ,loseit,dd2kiqc,1,t5_2rz8w

10538817,0,t3_5qwq2y,Well done for keeping on at it in a difficult spot. It sounds like youve analysed your habits  like the pepsi  and its doing some good for you!Here are some tips. Use a calorie tracking app like MFP. I hear you when you say that you have a fairly standard meal set but do it anyway. MFP will also help you how much you need to eat in a day to lose weight. Enter your exercise levels as sedentary. You can find out more in the Quick Start Guide.. Yeah weight loss takes a while especially when youre not super heavy for your size to begin with. Have patience with yourself. Most people aim to lose lb per week so youre actually on track! Also understand that weight fluctuates with what you eat and drink so sometimes you appear heavier than you are. dont sweat it just look for a downward trend over time.. As for your daily meal plan  it sounds like youre eating nothing but  frozen pizza a day at  calories? If thats the case is there any way you could get hold of some frozen veggies? I might be tempted to skip breakfast have half the pizza  veggies for lunch then half  veggies for dinner. If thats NOT the case and youre saying that you get other stuff as well consider not eating it all at once you get me?See weight loss is all about managing what goes in your mouth. What that is can be ANYTHING so long as you dont eat over your caloric deficit. That means yeah you can lose weight eating frozen pizza. You just gotta learn how to eat the right amount.,loseit,dd2owxd,3,t5_2rz8w

You could be eating at a deficit forever and losing weight but you still wont be able to run as far as someone who has been doing cardio but eating a surplus. To lose weight start in the kitchen. Fitness is still amazing but you dont have to go to a gym to work on cardio or strength. Get a skip rope for indoor cardio jog outdoors when weather permits buy your own weights. Most people that are at gyms are too busy worrying about themselves to worry about you. The people who are arent worth your time anyway.

10642295,0,t3_5s86np,I havent been successful at keeping weight off full disclosure.But i think i am currently going to stop weighing myself as long as i am hitting my caloric and exercise goals everyday. I have found throughout my experience at succeeding and failing that when i notice intermediate weight loss on the scales i use it as an excuse to have a well deserved cheat day. Since Im a binge eater this has ugly results.So since im starting out from the begining again with a tom of weight to get rid off. Im going to focus on tracking what i KNOW i need to do to definitively lose weight while ignoring the scale.I know that tracking your weight loss is helpful to determine if your calorie estimates have been accurate e.g. not losing weight over the past month means you havent actually been eating at a deficit and need to audit your recipes. But at least until i get momentum going with eating healthy and exercising i need to look away from the scale for a few months since illogically good results seem to hurt my progression.,loseit,dddo6bq,1,t5_2rz8w

For warmup just do a combination of stretches and mobility exercises before each exercise session. Also dont be afraid to edit this to your schedule you can make the  off days at different times depending on what you want and can change the order of upperlower if you want just as long as you never do  of the same workouts in a row.,loseit,dde23uu,1,t5_2rz8w

10661698,0,t1_ddff7ah,You can eat whatever you want my friend. If you want to lose weight all you have to do is consistently eat less calories than you burn. A good saying on this subreddit is losing weight is simple but it isnt easy. My best recommendation would be to get the MyFitnessPal app or use the web based version and start logging everything you eat. Get a kitchen scale from any grocery store target walmart amazon and start weighing everything you eat that isnt in serving sized packages. So like the peanutbutter scoop some out and weigh it before you eat so you know the calories or weigh the container before and after and subtract to get how much you ate. I love having bacon and eggs for breakfast or a night snack if I am still hungry and have room for the calories. I usually cook  pieces of bacon  calories  each and then cook  eggs  calories  each for a total around  calories.

Get your TDEE and your calorie goals so you understand what your aim is then start looking at the calories in your food. Then look at macronutrients  protein fat carbs  then when youre good on that start looking at micronutrients like potassium vitamin C etc. Tackle it one chunk at a time over time maybe  minutes a day learning something new about nutrition.   cut out sugars and as much as possible most artificial sweeteners that provoke a blood sugar response maltitol etc. Erythritol adn stevia are safe xylitol is pretty good too. No more sugar sweetened sodas no more candy no more cake. If you need a sweet do your homework and get a no cow bar or a quest bar or some stevia.  Start finding foods to add into your diet. Veggies salmon etc.  Prepare your foods beforehand  never ever be unprepared. Always have a safe snack or meal on hand always.  Eat for the goal not your desire. Stop picking the food you like best at the restaurant  start picking the food that best suits the goal you want to achieve. ,loseit,ddij0g4,2,t5_2rz8w

10747727,0,t3_5trbdp,Pretty sure there is a change you just dont see it. Theres a thing called body dysmorphia  basically you dont see in the mirror what you really look like. The picture of yourself is biased through mood expectation etc. The fact you dont see the change is because you look at yourself every single day  the change is so gradual that you will not see it.  The brain has a  hard time seeing the change but will adapt one day. Hence we recommend progress pictures so you have a direct comparison between your former and actual self. Maybe you got some old revealing pictures like bathing suit you can nearreplicate with your new body? Other ways to measure your progress is tape measurements or body fat percentage measurements disregard bf scales theyre erratic get your bf measured with calipers or a DEXA scan.

Then once you lower BF it can help boost the cut a little bit maybe making it easier for you.It sounds like you have been maintaining which is probably due to your weekend activity of eating at no or very little deficit. Maintaining isnt all bad though you are not gaining and that is great. Especially since you are working out. It most likely means that you are bulking up some muscle those newbie gains! while lose some of the fat ultimately lowering your bf.

10755439,0,t3_5ts2fs,Unpopular opinion coming  I am a former obese person. My husband is also a formerly morbidly obese person having weighed  pounds at his highest.I admit that when I have heard someone has lost weight via weight loss surgery I do think differently of them. I dont admire them I dont think what they went through is all that empowering or motivational. I do consider it to be taking the easy way out. These people had a lack of will determination and perseverance. They had surgery but that doesnt make them automatically okay with food. Have they learned how to deal with cravings saying no to food have they learned how to portion control have they learned to deal with triggers have they learned to face the emotional response that food gives them? Also the surgery could possibly cause complications they may need a revision later down the line it requires a lifetime of lab work and medications to make sure the person doesnt go into nutritional deficits malabsorption and intolerances. They are messing with a system that largely isnt meant to messed with.So to say that someone whos lost weight simply by putting down a  copay deserves the same merit as someone who has put in the grueling grunt work of a slow and steady healthy weight loss well I just dont agree. These patients most likely havent educated themselves nearly enough on the lifetime commitment and the mental relationship they have with food that got them to obesity in the first place. Are there cases where weight loss surgery makes sense? Absolutely. But the average candidate isnt that person. ,loseit,ddpccea,8,t5_2rz8w

10777013,0,t3_5rnx2o,I started maintenance  months ago too and in that time have lost an additional lbs primarily due to the slight fear of gaining it all back again. Im definitely with you on how tricky it is to get out of the losing mindset. Maintenance does seem a bit harder than losing because of how much more accuracy seems to be needed to find that middle ground. What Im trying to do at the moment to fight that fear is set myself a very tiny deficit like around cal so that I can appease that part of my brain that is scared of regain. That way if I eat over maintenance some days its okay because I have that buffer and if I do lose weight itll be really slow and I can address it by having a few days of eating more to balance it out. This might be an overly cautious approach though. Good luck in your maintenance journey I wish you all the best!,loseit,ddrkkn3,1,t5_2rz8w

Almost all the vegetarian options at standard restaurants in my area are pasta or bread based and I get sick of always eating cold food e.g. salad while everyone else has a hot meal... so I cave and eat the pasta.

10781617,0,t3_5u897j,So many ideas! and if you dont get the feedback you want on here go on Pinterest and type in makeahead lunches  jackpot. Heres what I love for lunches  White chicken chili  I make this in big batches and freeze single servings. I make bigger servings for my husband so hes getting about g of protein with each one and less for myself.  Thai coconut curry soup  chicken or shrimp in a coconut curry broth with sweet potatoes peppers and tofu bc added protein. I also usually serve this with about a quarter cup of black rice to make it a more satisfying meal.  Taco bowl  homemade refried beans on top of shredded lettuce with peppers tomatoes avocado  whatever else you like in tacos. The refried beans freeze really well and I chop up the veggies every few days. Sometimes I add ground beef roasted chicken breast or veggie ground round.  Chicken tortilla soup  freezes really well tons of recipes for this online.  Soup in a mason jar  cook ramen noodles put in a jar for ease of transport  could also use whatever tupperware you have top with julienned veggies sliced cooked meat maybe some fresh herbs cilantro or thai basil. Mix chicken broth with a bit of sesame oil and some sriracha and store in a separate container. When youre ready to eat heat the broth and add it to the jarred contents. Again this is less of a make weeks in advance one and more of a make a few days at a time. Baked chicken brown basmati rice roasted veg. Cook all in bulk portion out into containers and freeze. I cook the basmati rice in lowsodium chicken broth and use a variety of spices for the chicken some with allspice and oregano for example or some with cumin and chili powder and garlic and roast veggies that will stand up well to freezing like peppers and sweet potatoes.

Use proper entries check macros and calories against other websites like skipthepie or USDA and against your nutrition labels. Weigh or at least measure everything consistently.. Use the correct entries for the state in which you measuredweighed your food e.g. raw entry for raw weight. Doesnt matter if you weigh raw or cooked I do both. Just use the CORRECT ENTRIES!. Estimating at times is fine dont fret unless this happens every day. At this point estimate based on volume if you are not comfortable estimating the weight.. Log daily or as much as you can!. Always be within  of your gross goal meaning TDEE or netexercise cals goal unless you are specifically saving up for a special occasion. Consistency enables better patterntracking.. For the love of God DO NOT USE GENERIC RECIPES. Create your own recipes. always and forever.. Dont log stuff like omelet   egg or turkey sandwich. Log the INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENTS your oneegg omelet will be vastly different from my oneegg omelet.. WEIGH EVERYTHING including prepackaged items as they are often off from the stated labeled weight  I eat a brand of back bacon that lists  slices as g but they are almost always  grams for two slices! My protein bars are often g heavier than the label.You should be basing your caloric needs on either your nonexercise activity levels or your total daily energy expenditure which by its name means you include exercise into your average. If you choose the latter known as NEAT method then you would log your exercise and eat back at least half of the calories. A  calorie deficit is usually pretty sustainable for the average person.Health Calc IME is the most accurate calculator.

They will do things that sabotage you whether its intended or not. Whats important is how you deal with it. How are you going to deal with people eating pizza around the house and leaving it in the fridge? What will you do differently next time? Some hints  Avoid  if you spot pizza remove yourself from the situation.  Plan  take back control by planning in something else for a later date. You cant have the pizza because youre planning on having a donut at work tomorrow.  Abstain  You simply cannot have pizza that you have not planned in. Its a rule. Dont even consider it.  preempt  Take back control of pizza purchasing. buy  large make a salad share it with your family. Have two slices. The rest should be gone because they will have eaten it and you have had pizza.Are you logging and tracking your food in an app like MFP? And are you doing so before you eat? Its a lot easier to say no to pizza once youre aware of the calories in every single slice. Your breakfast was probably in excess of  calories. Did you log it in your diary before you ate it? Are you enjoying your food? If not consider learning how to eat stuff in moderation and work out how to make some switches around.gtlast month I was doing a full  hours of exercises but now I can only do  hour and recently there have been days that I just cant get myself to do anything.Okay listen. It sounds like youre going through a bad swing. Make sure youre getting the nutrients you need and actually eating enough. Check your TDEE. Also  this is a problem I get with my depression. Expecting myself to leave the house never mind go to the gym when Im on a low would be a bad idea. Thats why I have a baseline logging and tracking my calories and build my other habits on top of that. Nail down the simple stuff like logging and tracking eating right etc and you can keep going even when youre in a bad patch.And thats all you need to do  keep going keep eating under your TDEE just... keep on keeping on.If the weight is falling off you that quickly and youve been doing this for months its likely you arent eating enough. That could very well explain why you arent doing so hot in the exercise department...,loseit,ddz4xas,5,t5_2rz8w

10866124,0,t1_de0r33v,I relate to your story. I also was a teen who was put on SSRIs and also experienced very heavy suicidal ideation. I had reached a point where I set a date and had written goodbye letters to my friends and family. It just seemed inevitable that it was something that was going to happen one way or another. Strange looking back at it now. Once I found out through a conversation with a nurse that SSRIs could do this I immediately stopped taking the medication and the improvement in my mental health was huge. I also regret that my doctor wasnt more clear on how to take the medications and what to expect.Like you I am too freaked out from the experience to try medication again. In fact I went through many bouts of agoraphobia and was unable to leave my home without panic attacks and even then I insisted I would never go on meds again. I could handle some Ativan in an emergency but otherwise I wouldnt do it. I no longer suffer from either depression or anxiety but still feel like I lost a lot of time in my life due to mental illness and meds that werent right for me. ,loseit,de0rhxl,2,t5_2rz8w

After drinking the brain finds the smell of food more appealing. Ethanol alcohol sends out hunger signals from the brain. Galanin a neuropeptide production in the brain is stimulated by drinking alcohol and eating fatty foods  leading to consuming more alcohol and more fatty foods.

Your entire daily calories could be made up of sugar and youd still lose weight as long as its under your TDEE. Youd just feel like shit and be starving. As long as you can do sugar in moderation then theres no problem with having it in your diet. Some people find that they cant handle moderation when it comes to sugar so they go for no sugar at all.

10882101,0,t3_5vilp7,I believe this sub has a tendency to underestimate calories burned from exercise. I certainly subscribe to the idea that weight loss is  food intake and  exercise but that  is not negligible. With a sedentary TDEE of over  if youre eating between  calories averaging around  you should be losing about two pounds a week already.For you even a leisurely hour bike ride youre probably going to be burning over  calories to start.Long is quite subjective and obviously the pace will matter significantly but at least short term you could easily be burning well over  calories burned for each bike ride you do. Heck if you can average over  MPH and keep it up for  minutes you can push  calories.If you want to do more than leisurely and more than an hour especially on backtoback days youll almost certainly feel the need to increase your intake on those days to have the energy. ,loseit,de2etia,2,t5_2rz8w

10893587,0,t1_de3f61r,I know that must have been difficult for you. Its hard to deal with thyroid disorder because it affects so many systems. Having too much or too little thyroid can lead to the symptoms you describe. Even if you find the right amount for you that dosage may require adjustment in the longterm. Its a constant challenge and requires vigilance.With desiccated thyroid the dosing is inconsistent due to the manufacturing process. Thus you may be experiencing bouts of hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism or euthyroidism depending on each refill. There is a lot of evidence for best practices regarding levothyroxine. Its the most commonly prescribed drug in America and is the subject of much clinical investigation.Your symptoms are consistent with hyperthyroidism. You should not have been switched from levothyroxine to NatureThroid immediately. The problem is not with synthetic T. You are getting the same active ingredient in both natural and synthetic products but the natural product has a much lower guarantee of dose accuracy. Would you happen to know your TSH level? The doctor should have titrated you down to make sure it was due to excess thyroid replacement and not a confounding issues. It would take about two weeks for you to notice an effect with any new thyroid medication or dose. Not to mention your Hashimotos...I would check also your adherence. Were you taking your thyroid medication on an empty stomach in the mornings  min before any meals? Were you taking the medication with any other medications or OTC products that might affect absorptionclearance? Multivitamins would contain mineral salts that inhibit the absorption of thyroid hormone. Drugs for epilepsy cause you to eliminate thyroid hormone faster than normal. Most other medications should be ok but wait about  hours between taking thyroid medication and taking calciumiron supplements or bile acid sequestrants which you may be taking for cholesterol. It doesnt matter what you take first just be sure to take them far apart. Also get a medication box so you never miss a dose.I often see patients who start separating their levothyroxine dose from other drugs that could cause complications AND get a medication box. Their adherence goes to nearly perfect and they begin to experience hyperthyroidism. Their previous dose was perfect for them as long as they missed a dose a few times weekly. Now that they are getting every dose they are getting way too much thyroid replacement.,loseit,de3lh6r,2,t5_2rz8w

I made room for a lastminute bloody mary last night that was offered to me by a friend who is known for her cocktails. My first thought should have been How nice! but instead it was Fuck I hope this doesnt put me over for the day. I definitely dont want to come across as ungrateful to my friends when theyre just being good hosts so Im paying attention more to how those thoughts play out in my words and actions. Im trying to take an acknowledge and let it pass approach regardless of whether I accept an offered food item or not.Im trying to respect boundaries a bit more with regard to my fitness choices as well  Ive had a couple friends basically tell me to cool it with all the calorie and exercisecentric talk because theyre recovered from EDs and thinking too much about food in any way is a big trigger. Its also forced me to consider where the line is between healthconscious and disordered thinkingtalking about foodsomething Ive never put much thought into before.

10925815,0,t3_5w2yvg,Hey! Im about your height and also started at about?  didnt buy a scale until a few days in. I started about  weeks ago and am down to   my goal is a pound a week so Im about on track.I think your kg plan is a good one and totally doable. My app is giving me  calday in order to lose a pound a week and while Ive done well keeping at or under that it can be difficult staying in that slim margin between  which is the minimum recommended calorie intake for women  dont try to go below this youll just make yourself fatigued and hungry. If you can plug in your lunchdinner at the beginning of the day so you have some idea of how much wiggle room you have. And while were just counting calories and not fat protein etc. its sad but true that real food DOES fill you up more than junk. You CAN have chips for dinner but youll regret it when youre out of calories and starving. Ive never been a big breakfast person and dont get enough protein anyway so the Premier Protein shake or Kirkland protein bar both from Costco are great breakfast options for me and dont steal too many calories from the rest of my day.I use Lose It!  I just put in my starting weightheight and started tracking. If you can weigh yourself regularly and input your weight every few days or whenever it changes Lose It! will modify your daily calories. If youd like inspiration beyond the scale you might take some starting weight pics or jot down some measurements with such a small loss it can be difficult to really see the difference but Ive lost two inches on my waist. And it DOES work. Ive never attempted to lose weight before and had kind of assumed that this was my new reality but this week Ive fit into both a pair of jeans and a dress that did NOT fit last fall. Just stick to it and log everything  I dont know how many oz Hersheys kisses Ive logged but they add up!Its all in portion control  my biggest weakness is ice cream. But Ive had both milkshakes and Dairy Queen since starting out and still lost weight. The secret is to eat half the shake or blizzard and put the other half in the fridge for tomorrow...Hopefully some of this helped??

While it was helpful in gaining a sense of food and the communities on the site were a good resources I ultimately quit because it cost a lot of money to maintain and I got frustrated with the constant conversions of things to points. It was useful in starting to reorientate myself towards better eating but there was also too much focus on special branded foods. If you want community support this is a great place.

10955981,0,t3_5weoth,  Food scale  an absolute must for accurate CICOing.  Going heavierish on protein keeps me more satiated throughout the day.  works well for me. I will still keep carbs around  like normal.  Allowing myself one maintain day per week keeps my sanity in check. By maintain day I mean I let myself have a night out on Fridays. Nevertheless the goal is to stay away from the maintain limit as much as possible but I feel like I can let loose and not feel bad about going over a couple hundred calories because Id still be under for the week. This will inherently slow the weightloss process but if youre like me and youve had trouble sticking with the plan this could be your answer.  Keeping myself busy  HUGE for me. The more I sit around the more my habits start to creep in. I keep myself busy and my mind doesnt have a chance to think about the food that it wants.tldr  My secrets include weighing my stuff out going heavierish on protein allowing myself a day to go over by a few hundred calories and keeping myself busy.,loseit,dea155e,1,t5_2rz8w

It is pretty calorie dense and is easy to eat more than a serving. Something else that might help is a protein drink of some kind. I like the premier protein drinks from Costco. They taste pretty good only  calories and  gram of sugar but pack a nice  grams of protein. Its the best one protein wise Ive seen.

Things I guess I want to know I am a big guy even without the weight and all of the health advice I have been given seems to be geared at people probably around average height and build who have then become overweight. Changing that information around a bit Id love to just find a ballpark figure on how much of certain things I should eat to lose weight per day. As an example things such as Chicken breast red meat eggs vegetables fruits rice and pasta. On a side note being a university student I am a big fan of putting whatever is available into a tortilla usually chicken and salad but I would like to know if tortillas are a bad choice?

10992305,0,t3_5wvlk6,I guess this is more of a rhetorical questionobservationHow has the fitness industry gotten away with advertising that exercise is the  key to weight loss for so many years?So many people come to this sub for the first time and I see them talk about their weight loss plan that involves joining a gym and eating healthier and all I can think of is how much their perspective has been shaped by marketing. I was the same way until recently. Until I discovered this sub calorie counting sounded like something only an obsessive borderlineED person would do. Everything I knew about losing weight revolved around what I could do in the GYM not what I could leave off my plate. My prerloseit perspective was shaped by the billions of dollars a year that are directed at advertising to women like me that joining a gym or starting CK on Jan st every year will get me the body I want. It actually makes me angry because so many people give up on their goals because they think they have to spend money on a gym or a trainer. Sadder still they work really hard in that gym or with that trainer and still dont see results. I understand that exercise helps you tone up and has many benefits but if your ultimate goal is only to lose weight CICO is the way to do it and it has irrefutable science to back it up.

Counting calories on this App I downloaded has seriously opened my eyes. It is crazy to see how many calories are in foods we used to eat like it was nothing. Last weekend my husband and I went to a restaurant and I preplaned what I was going to order. Instead of mashed potato I opted for a baked sweet potato with butter on the side. I got to thinking hay I will just go out for a small ice cream after...Ive been good. Man the size of this small ice cream would feed three people. I find the portion sizes to be crazy out of control...there was no way this thing was a small. The ice cream was in a bowl and the soft serve was as tall as my head. I ate a little bit than wound up throwing the rest out. I sat there thinking to myself...a few weeks ago you would have ate this whole thing yourself and it made me both sad for myself and yet proud that I didnt eat it all and resisted the temptation to do so. I guess knowing is half the battle for all of us trying to get better. I know exactly how you feel. ,loseit,deh0lik,1,t5_2rz8w

I definitely dont aim to eat only salad and fruit by any means those are just examples of things I try to replace what Im craving I.e. bagels Chinese food burgers tacos hot wings. All the bad foods that are my favorite with some kind of healthy replacement. But if that replacement doesnt appeal to me then I figure Im not actually hungry I just wanna eat.

11042398,0,t3_5xohck,The time to start bulking is when you are happy with your fat loss and want to start adding muscle.  As for the switch maybe take it slow at first. Say like a week or so eating at maintenance then adding  calories a day for a couple weeks Not like  extra a day each day just going from like  a day until you hit that sweet spot of gaining at a pace your can keep up with.  Bulking requires a surplus of calories which means you may and most likely put on some fat. It comes with the program. But you have learned how to cut so as long as you dont freak out if you get a little fluffy around the edges you will be good.  You might also try what is called body recomp Basics is you eat less calories on days you dont workout and closer to maintenance on days you do workout. You wont be getting super bulky or anything of that nature but you can build muscle. And might be a better option if you are looking to being shirtless and more defined by summer.Bulking is normally a wintertime program since it takes away some definition and all.,loseit,dejmx82,1,t5_2rz8w

It doesnt impact your total energy expenditure which is the most important measure in determining if you are burning fat or storing it over the course of time.Unless youre on a controlled drip that steadily gives you nutrients at a slightly slower rate than your body uses them youre in a pretty constant state of storing new fat and burning old.  It still comes down to calories.You may get a different answer in rfitness but I find that very little if any of the advice there is evidence based and on the occasions that it is its typically presented wrongly and assumes conclusions that the researchers didnt come to.,loseit,del4va7,1,t5_2rz8w

11097549,0,t1_depu41h,Saying dump him is easy but feelings are not usually so cut and dry.Honestly the issue for me is he shouldnt have said that in the first place. he was rude insensitive and downright mean. And I think you should consider whether he actually loves you as much as you care about him. Because if he really loved you he wouldnt have said any of that. Especially the part about why he doesnt want to have sex with you. And after that kind of betrayal do you think you could really go back to trusting him? Relationships dont work if you cant be vulnerable with each other.  Being overweight does not make you useless. At all. You are amazing. And should be proud of yourself for starting to do something about it. You are a wonderful person. Being overweight doesnt change that at all. ,loseit,depwbkm,9,t5_2rz8w

I also gain  pound in water weight the week before my period then it falls off a week later. All you can really expect to lose in three weeks is  pounds at most so its possible that any real weight loss is being masked by water weight fluctuations especially those that result from hormonal fluctuations. ,loseit,deqc2ev,5,t5_2rz8w

Other times I go below protein this is much less common and go higher in fat andor carbs.Its really about the overall picture. If you find that you are naturally gravitating towards carbs more than fat then increase your carb goal. I keep my fat goal lower because I know I love carbs but some days I will go upwards of g fat just because I crave it that day.I would suggest that for the rest of the day just eat nutrient dense carbs  nonstarchy veggies low calorie fruit like berries  and sources of protein and fat such as any meatfish product eggs cheese butter and oils nuts nut butter avocado edamame is good in terms of legumes for being low carb. And from here on out it will probably be a good idea to swap out more protein for some of those carbs you eat. What is a typical breakfast like for you?

I dont blame them for my choices of wanting to eat a can of condensed milk as a snack...  Nowadays my daughter is yo and weighs around  although she is .  Both me and my wife always tried to teach our kids to eat healthier but we only started to show them by our actions once we both committed to be healthy after she was bullied in grade  for being bigger than other kids. Fast forward  years and she now wants to practice exercise routines with us and wants to eat healthy. She does have a constipation issue which we found out recently is caused by milk based products pastas and rice. She has avoided those  of the times and she doesnt look or feel bloated as she used too. It is not easy to be a parent but dont let others judgment affect you since no one is perfect and you already have the right mind set to try to help your son.

I struggle with that a lot.As for your previous attempts at counting how far were you restricting calories?  A lot of people go all gung ho and eat waaaay too little then burn out pretty quickly. Maybe your target was set too low?At the end of the day youve got  real options figure out a way to change your eating habits or dont.  If you want to work on changing your habits Id recommend starting small.  When you go out for fast food get the unsweet tea instead of sweet stuff like that.  One small change at a time.  Eventually your one small change becomes a habit and youll be able to make another small change.  You have the rest of your life to improve yourself theres no sense in rushing into things.  If you cant find a way to change your habits no surgery in the world could help.

11189487,0,t1_df0403e,Well a little background is appropriate.I played sports in high school.  Took weight training classes too.  Lifted weights off and on all through my s.  Never beyond an intermediate level usually would quit around  months lol but I knew my way around a weight room and have a decent knowledge of the fundamentals.When I first started losing weight I was a chef so was at least active in that sense and wasnt starting out from a completely sedentary condition.  I was however crippled in that I had ZERO flexibility of any sort.  My lower back hips legs and core were all sorts of fucked up from years of standing on concrete for  hours a day.  I was in constant physical pain.  I had also not deliberately exercised in probably close to  years when I got back into it.First step for me was some yoga along cardio light weights.  Like VERY light for my size and even for what I could technically lift.  I worked on form.  Every.  Single.  Workout.  I lost my ego and stopped caring about the numbers I was putting up.  To this day I dont really track linear progression because frankly I just dont care very much.When it comes to actual exercises I honestly wing it.  I stopped caring so much about bench press and glamour muscles and have really been concentrating on getting my back and shoulders stronger lately.  Which has the added benefit of making pretty much every other lift better from squats to bench press.  I hate routine and constantly try to switch things up to keep my body from getting into a rut. I do what feels good and try to superset pushpull exercises but stay fluid and play it by ear.Building that earlier foundation has made me stronger than I ever was when I was lifting heavier weights.  I have been pretty pleased with any muscle gains Ive gotten considering Ive been losing weight for over  years.  I am also achingly close to being able to do a proper pullup for the first time in my entire life.  Consistency is what has mattered for me not the specifics.Also now that Im smaller I have introduced a lot more cardio.  I will generally try to do  minutes on an elliptical on my nonlifting days and will very often get to the gym  days a week depending on my schedule.  I tried to do some running when I was about ish and my knees just would not cooperate so I said fuck it and gave it up.  I can still get a great workout without pounding my joints for no reason.Edit  I forgot to add  I have usually shot for a  calorie deficit.  Obviously this doesnt happen all the time lol.  I have tended to lose weight in large chunks maintainfluctuate for a few months and then get back into being very mindful about my diet.  Recently I have been VERY on top of things and have lost about  pounds since the first of the year.  I am not perfect.  I have backslid  pounds here and there over the past couple years.  The big difference is that I got back on track after a particularly bad period instead of just quitting like I did in the past.  As Ive gotten thinner my propensity to binge and make choices has dipped significantly.,loseit,df0bcqo,2,t5_2rz8w

11255905,0,t3_60ndos,Well I will just leave this here as I am assuming metabolic abnormality is not the cause.Accurate logging. Use proper entries check macros and calories against other websites like skipthepie or USDA and against your nutrition labels. Weigh or at least measure everything consistently. Weigh solids measure liquids.. Use the correct entries for the state in which you measuredweighed your food e.g. raw entry for raw weight. Doesnt matter if you weigh raw or cooked I do both. Just use the CORRECT ENTRIES!. Estimating at times is fine dont fret unless this happens every day. At this point estimate based on volume if you are not comfortable estimating the weight.. Log daily or as much as you can!. Always be within  of your gross goal meaning TDEE or netexercise cals goal unless you are specifically saving up for a special occasion.

11258240,0,t3_60otcw,So it is all or nothing??  If you cant look like an unrealistic fitness model then youd rather stay overweight and unhealthy?  Believe me there is an inbetween which is a really good place to be.  Try not to compare yourself to anyone else.  Set realistic goals and relish in your accomplishment when you meet those goals.  I am definitely not a fitness model.  I am however only  pounds from MY goal. I work out  days a week at the gym.  I can run more than three miles without stopping.  I can run up a few flights of stairs without dying.  According to my doctor my bloodwork is all in the healthy range.  I am stronger and more fit than ever.  I may still weigh a lot more than others do but I know that I am healthier and more fit and continue to make progress every day.  Perfection is the enemy of progress!  ,loseit,df83rxa,4,t5_2rz8w

If you want to lift after losing then that means youll have lost far more muscle mass than is ideal.

If you maintain a reasonable deficit that is not aggressive for your stats then there really wont be much issue with lifting in a deficit. Being in a deficit period increases hunger hormones.

They literally took cooked quinoa formed it into a patty fried it and threw it on a bun. I took exactly one bite before sending it back. It was the first time in all my  years Ive ever sent food back. It definitely felt uncomfortable but if Im going to splurge on fatty restaurant food it had damn well better be delicious or Im not going to waste my precious calories on it! The old me would have just pretended that I liked it instead of dealing with confrontation with complete disregard to what I was spending my calories on. It was a pretty big realization for me that this is all truly becoming a change in lifestyle and it feels awesome!BTW dark chocolate has become my  goto for a lowish calorie sweet treat. I love Green amp Blacks! D,loseit,dfhn15r,8,t5_2rz8w

11345003,0,t3_61wtu4,HeyI think its great that youve decided to focus on getting your weight under control!Id encourage you to take a look at the links the AutoMod provided especially the Quick Start Guide. That lays out an effective and sustainable approach to weight loss.Weight loss boils down to consuming fewer calories than you burn on a daily basis. As such the single most effective thing you can do in order to lose weight is learn out to count your calories accurately and stick to a moderate calorie deficit. Exercise is great for your overall health and mood but your diet  specifically how many calories you consume  is a much bigger factor when it comes to weight loss. As the saying goes you cant outrun your fork! If youre serious about wanting to lose weight  and actually understand how weight management works so that you can keep it off in the long term  Id encourage you to start counting your calories.Good luck  you can do this!,loseit,dfhxpk8,3,t5_2rz8w

11349329,0,t1_dfieb0k,gt yep this right here. in my experience  of the time someone is only asking how you did it because they want to tell you how you shouldve done it.Its definitely A Thing. The first time I had a picture up on Facebook where you could see I lost a lot of weight an old friend called me. She kept me on the phone for an hour telling me how I lost weight. I got off the phone after that and thought did that really just happen?? A big part of it is that no one wants to hear that you eat less and track what you eat. Thats way too simple and they dont want that. If you buy into CICO then theres no excuse for not doing it. They want to hear that it was hard so they have an excuse for not bothering. I know thats true for my friends and my MIL. I keep telling her eat less track everything. But she doesnt want to so excuses excuses excuses. My favorite WTF moment of that was when she came over for dinner and decided that she could eat what I ate. I told her I had eaten some carrots for lunch and gone to the gym so I could have a plate of sauce and meatballs and pasta for dinner. And that that was not a good idea for her but she didnt listen. ,loseit,dfifby2,3,t5_2rz8w

11350183,0,t3_61wehs,To be candid I find it funny that many on this sub INSIST on the  intake minimums for men and women but then also insist on not counting exercise calories...If youre doing significant amounts of exercise I think its crucial to include them in your count for the day. Reason being that if you dont you run the risk of eating way too little for the day running too great a deficit and setting yourself up for a binge. For example I ran a half marathon on Sunday humble brag sorry. A conservative running calories burned calculator told me that I burned about  kcals in the race based on my pace gender age and weight. Had I not eaten some of those back Id have run a giant deficit for the day and Monday probably would have been a disaster due to extreme hunger. The key is getting the estimate of calories burned right. As many will note MFP and Fitbit are almost always way way too high. If you run walk or cycle there are various online tools often geared toward more serious endurance athletes that generate much more conservative estimates of caloric output than MFP etc. I would recommend exploring those if you havent already. ,loseit,dfiitei,6,t5_2rz8w

11360049,0,t3_62465e,Hi Im sorry to hear that youre having a rough time right now. When I first started CICO it was all I could think about. Measuring this counting that... It drove my wife a registered dietitian crazy.Eventually I realized that the obsessive counting was good but not totally necessary. After a while I had a good idea what size portions should look like what sorts of foods to choose and a basic understanding of meeting nutrientmacro goals. I still think about it but once youre armed with that knowledge its not something that you have to think about all day.Regarding the binge eating I highly suggest seeking professional support.

Instead of going once a day maybe you are going once every three days. That is normal as long as it is easy to go. Keeping an eye on the fiber is still a good idea since it will help keep everything moving. Believe it or not there are charts that will show you poop forms and will describe what ideal poop looks like. I know crazy right? Constipation poop tends to be hard round balls. Ideal poop is more like a soft continuous mass. Indeed if you can go and its not painful and all balled up you are most likely just fine. ,loseit,dfkpjb0,2,t5_2rz8w

11374045,0,t3_628clg,I can only advise about the breathlessness because Im on supplemental oxygen and most exercises lower my oxygen saturation and leave me needing like  minutes to catch my breath properly.Look into zumba gold fitness routines in Youtube. Theyre lower impact and often done with the aid of a chair or while seated. Its definitely not the same as running but it will get your heart rate up and youll be moving your body but for me it has helped me to be able to exercise but not become breathless. Eventually the bronchitis will clear and youll be able to exercise as normal for you but remember to ease back into it so you dont injure yourself. Exercise is exercise but you will lose some of the stamina you had built up from running or walking on a regular basis. But youll get it back. If you find that youre running out of breath just sitting and having casual conversation you might talk to your doctor to find out if your oxygen saturation is low. And if it gets worse definitely talk to your doctor about it. ,loseit,dfl87m9,1,t5_2rz8w

11383429,0,t1_dfm93mq,Is your walking specifically exercise or just normal daily activity outside of exercise? If the former then start tracking it you dont need the specific speed you can just use estimates from MFP and pick the closest to your energy levels while walking and log  eat back at least half the calories. If its just daily activity then monitor for a week and average it out. Chances are if you are walking consistently at the rate you describe you could be lightly active when you also consider the activities of daily living everyone does. I highly suggest the beginner programs Strong Lifts and Starting Strength as they will be very important for maintaining lean mass but it will also require eating enough protein and a moderate rather than aggressive deficit max  deficit from maintenance. .glb or glb of Lean body mass or goal weight is a good starting point for protein!,loseit,dfmajat,1,t5_2rz8w

11492462,0,t1_dfymbuw,In that case Id say you are lightly active at least. I walk  minutes on average a day and do a few hours of activities of daily living which makes me lightly active without exercise being included. SInce you also exercise on top of this you could be moderately active depending on how often you exercise and its intensity.This sub IMO offers terrible advice when it tells everyone they are sedentary and to ignore exercise calories. Since very few people sit on their asses all day the amount of activity they do outside of working out influences their NEAT. One person may do the type of activity I do and be lightly active as a result or they may stand for most of their shift at work making them potentially more than lightly active in work. Every individual needs to actually evaluate their own activity levels overall because when you are maintaining you will need to eat in accordance to your overall activity levels.This is the calculator I recommend the most because it is highly cusotmizable and the only one that is remotely accurate for me,loseit,dfyo40g,1,t5_2rz8w

11503490,0,t1_dfzx0ys,Welcome! Id recommend that you start by checking out this subs Quick Start Guide That lays out an effective and sustainable approach to weight loss that you can follow even if there are limits on the kind of exercise you can do.Weight loss boils down to consuming fewer calories than you burn on a daily basis. As such the single most important thing you can do if you want to manage your weight effectively is learn how to count calories accurately and honestly and consistently hit a reasonable daily calorie goal. Most folks around here use an app like MyFitnessPal to track their calories and many of us use food scales to ensure were being accurate with our portions.While exercise is great for your overall health and mood your diet  specifically how many calories you consume  is a much bigger factor when it comes to weight loss. Check out this article for more evidence on that point.Good luck  you can do this!,loseit,dfzx5u0,5,t5_2rz8w

11507147,0,t1_dg07s21,There have been plenty of times ive not eaten a lot during the day and still not been hungry then by the evening I binge. When I do everything the same but eat more during the day I wont binge. So that could still be a factor. Otherwise based on the type of food you are eating and saying you are not proud of eating spaghetti and cookies and saying you dont enjoy the bad food because its bad for your health indicates to me that the issue lies possibly more in the psychological issue of restricting foods that you actually enjoy the taste of. ALL food is healthy. If you only eat bananas you are not eating a healthy diet. So its not about the individual food its the context of your whole day. You having eaten a few cookies and spaghetti is not unhealthy considering you ate other nutrient dense foods. Do you see yourself never eating things like cookies and fast food the rest of your life? If not which is the case for most people I have come across then learning how to have a positive and healthy relationship with food and eating things in moderation rather than placing a value judgment on individual foods or food types would be a good idea. Based on your example menu its hard to come up with estimates because you did not specify things like rough measurements or size of some things like the spaghetti or what several cookies means. But just based on putting in a rough estimate of your pre  food intake its less than  calories. That is not enough if your goal is to stop eating at pm.If you added spaghetti lets say a serving of pasta based on the box and maybe  cup of spaghetti sauce and lets say  chocolate chip cookies from Chips Ahoy thats about  for the whole day. This is a very rough estimate because of the lack of details you provided. So if this were anywhere near correct its  calories below what I would recommend you consume to lose weight. I can see why your body would be having this physiological response. ,loseit,dg0c45i,2,t5_2rz8w

11511345,0,t1_dg0squi,Yeah I understand your feelings. Its hard. Theres been some times where Im tempted to regain weight just to fill out again but theres no guarantee that the fat would settle there unfortunately! What I will say and this may be TMI is that the shape of my breasts changed. They used to be fuller on the top penduloussaggy and nipples pointed straight at the ground. Now the overall volume is less but the nipples are positioned differently theyre now pointed outfront not down. So even though the volume has decreased and theyre still saggy I actually like that one little change. I will also say that getting a GOOD bra is really really important!!

11542295,0,t3_64q04f,If your depression is anything like my depression probably not everyone is different you have bad days and less bad days. On the less bad days you should set yourself up for success on the bad days. Sorry if there is a formatting issue am on mobile. Preprep as much as you can. If you have a cucumber in the fridge on a bad day you will let it sit and grab something quick and probably unhealthy instead. If it is as easy to grab something healthy maybe it would be easier to make that choice. . Celebrate every good choice you make and dont beat yourself up over the bad ones. Its ok. No one is perfect. Everyone has eaten too much cake at some point or another. You cant let that one time dictate what you do going forward. Each little victory counts. . Dont think of healthy food as a punishment. You are not eating yucky vegetables because you are fat and dont deserve good tasting food. You are eating nourishing healthy food because you are awesome and your body deserves the best. . Taking away foods you enjoy can feel bad so dont make it the first thing you change. Add in some vegetables or protein whatever you are most lacking. I started with broccoli and zucchini. I ate tons of broccoli to start and found that after a few weeks I missed it if I skipped it. Also I found that I was so full from the veggies that I didnt have room for the bad stuff. . Dont think of this as a diet. You are changing your life for the better. It isnt this temporary thing that once the oh so magical scale says a certain thing you can stop. . Find ways to reward yourself for little milestones that dont include food. Find ways to make yourself feel better after a shitty day that dont involve food. This will move your emotional attachment to food elsewhere. This one is hard use the internet for ideas pick the ones that sound good to you and give them a try. Get help with the depression.

Extra super paranoid? Take that password protected zip file and run it though PGP encryption keep that file in an encrypted folder on your system name it something innocuous.

By that I mean look on the side of the bag of pasta and itll usually have a suggested serving size. Make a show of having the suggested size and point out how its not restrictive eating its just normal portions again. Or possibly use that hand metaphor thing for portions eg palm size and thickness of meat a thumbs worth of fats or whatever that metric is. Perhaps nix the sweet treats and just aim to have more regular sized portions. At this point as well I wouldnt change your menus all that much in case that spooks your wife somewhat.Obviously you know your wife better than us lot so do what you feel is best. ,loseit,dgfl2bi,3,t5_2rz8w

11660615,0,t3_66dtr1,Heya  Depression sucks. It manages to warp your perception and make everything terrible. Causes you to lose your motivation to think things differently. Weight loss could certainly help. Heres why.  At the end of the day when youre feeling down you can at least say hey things might suck but at least I took that  minute walk Hey things arent going that great but I lost lbs    I sweated a bunch and Im sore but thats because I did that workout  I ate a nice healthy meal. I met my calorie goal today.  Weightless can help by providing you all these goals that you can keep attaining.  minute walk.  minutes. Meeting your calorie goal X number of days in a row. Something that you can go back and say I did that. That was all me. Despite everything I made that happen. Its hard proof too. You wont magically forget that you took that walk or that your favorite pair of jeans is fitting better. Depression cant take that from you.  Think of it as a tool that can help. Concrete proof that things are improving that youre improving and its all completely because youre making it happen. Knowing that knowing that you personally are the reason for those successes how can that not help boost your confidence? Seeing that youre working hard and getting results that youre moving forward no matter how small the step. Gives you that proof that you did this. You have every right to be confident because you made yourself healthier  It wont be easy but it can help. No one thing is a magical cure for depression. You cant rub a lotion on a broken bone and have it heal. It takes time it takes steps. Wish you much luck and success ,loseit,dghquip,2,t5_2rz8w

11669846,0,t3_66is44,Meal prepping for sure you dont have to go crazy about it. I do breakfast for the week usually. I cant eat the same lunch and dinner too for  days straight. It makes me sick. At the most I make a large dinner and take that for lunch next day. Meal prep doesnt have to mean for the whole week as long as youre being prepared in some way it helps. My worst days calorie wise is when I wake up for work and have nothing made and no ideas of what to do quickly before work. TAKE PICTURES AND MEASUREMENTS. Its so hard to see your progress when you look in the mirror everyday. Take pictures take measurements. It helps so much. Sometimes the scale doesnt move much for some people but they will be losing inches and look so much better. Record EVERYTHING. Even if its a cheat day cheat meal the Parmesan cheese you sprinkle on your pasta. ,loseit,dgisjuq,1,t5_2rz8w

11713812,0,t3_674ca1,There are three reasons for me. My weight gives me anxiety so if I just weigh myself every day it takes the anxiety away.. I am wellinformed of the cause and effect of everything Ive consumed recently and can follow and then predict trends.. I have a morning jumpstart routine and the very first thing I do is weigh myself and input the datum on my spreadsheet.Logging calories has a horrible effect on my wellbeing. I find having to constantly log caloric intake causes me to think about food much more often than if I didnt log it. Because of that I dont use MFP anymore or any other means of calorie counting. I do have a very good grasp on caloric density and portioning of foods I eat so I feel this is very important to my success. I just do a meal prep every Sunday and preportion every meal in its entirety so I dont have to deal with that.Regarding the SO I live with my SO who does not have any caloric restrictions at all. I just do my own thing and ask him how many portions of it hed like for the week. Usually its  depending on what Im making. We run errands and do groceries on Saturdays so we usually eat out. I just make sure what I eat is reasonable. On Sunday I spend most of the day preparing for the week so Im already in the right frame of mind to make great choices for myself.   ,loseit,dgnsg20,1,t5_2rz8w

From your confidence all the way down to reaching for the remote.  EVERYFUCKINGTHING IS BETTER.It will hurt at first for a while.  But once you power through the first threshold and see that sale read lbs or whatever...you will be hooked.  You will start to daydream about your life without all the weight and you will want it that much more.Everything is better. EDIT  Read a couple posts down and noticed someone said not to try to do too much at first.  This is VERY true.  Baby steps.

11738125,0,t1_dgqbw95,I totally get where youre coming from OP. IMO as a fellow binge eater planning a binge is way better than indulging in one spontaneously. I log all my meals a week in advance because I need the structure but it does get monotonous. And monotony can cause you to breakdown and fall back into bad habits if its too restrictive. I think it depends on how you feel. If you truly feel this works for you and your body you feel totally able to do it longterm and you dont feel deprived or like you live every day living for that one cheat day then great. You do you. Just check in with your moods regularly and make sure youre not about to go off the rails.

The whole clean your plate  and there are starving kids in Africa are part of the reasons I never learned to moderate my food intake at mealtime.  I thought eating until you were stuffed to bursting was normal.It also didnt help that my mothers idea of a vegetable was side dish from a can and everything was so salty and gross I didnt want to eat it.

11766714,0,t1_dgtpqkx,I like creating recipes in MFP and logging the elements.  I struggle with potion control though so I like knowing whats one reasonable portion.While I totally get wanting to ease in would strongly advise against eating back exercise calories.  Its just so hard to track them accurately and unless your primary exercise is decently paced running or a similarly intense cardio you probably arent burning enough to really impact your deficit. One thing that might be helpful is to ease in by focusing on stricter tracking but not worrying as much about the deficit.  So just track for a couple of weeks but dont even look at the calories.  For me at least the most important part of finally being successful at weight loss was really acknowledging what I was eating or rather how much.  Until I did that weight loss was so much harder because I desperately didnt want to know the calories I was eating.  Now that I do weight loss is a lot more relaxing.  After all my body is accurately tracking every calorie in and out me tracking accurately just keeps my brain and body on the same page.,loseit,dgtscv5,2,t5_2rz8w

11766957,0,t3_67wn2i,I always overoverOVER estimate when my work caters in.Make sure youre counting everything taking lots of tastes while cooking a small piece of candy in the office the creamer in your coffee etc.. And drink a TON of water. Thatll at least help any water weight come off!Also we tall folks can have a few more calories a day than our short counterparts. Make sure once you get used to counting your cals that youre giving yourself enough fuel. Id suggest finding out what you BMR is and subtract  from it.,loseit,dgttcl7,1,t5_2rz8w
11768009,0,t3_67wn2i,Lets start with the basics.The goal is fat loss not weight loss.  At least it is for most of us I mean I could lose as much weight as I want by cutting off some body parts but my wife wouldnt be too happy about that.Fat loss is achieved by eating at a caloric deficit which it sounds like you are youll get better at estimating and weighing as you go but I think youre probably good.How much fat you lose is  determined by how large your deficit is.  The same isnt true for your weight.  A scale doesnt measure fat it measures the force of gravity on any object placed on its surface.  It can tell you zero about what that object is.In this case its a big bag of skin filled with lots of things organs muscle blood shit pee water and yes fat.In  week you may have lost . pounds of fat or so you didnt mention if you are male or female but you could easily be retaining that much water thats only  oz of water I regularly pee that much I drink a lot of coffee and ice water.You are going to drive yourself crazy if you are expecting a straight line weight loss every single day or week.Here is my advice.  Relax.  Chill out.  Realize that not only will weight loss take a long time but if your true goal is to maintain a healthy weight it will literally be a lifetime of watching what you eat.A scale is not an accurate measure of success or failure your calorie log is much better for that.,loseit,dgtxngp,1,t5_2rz8w

11768783,0,t3_67uwbm,Where to start! I guess this is my day  too. I used to be about  pounds lighter but several years ago I went through some stressful life stuff and decided I deserved to treat myself with food. The problem was that I did that pretty much every day.Ive tracked with MFP before and always fallen off the wagon so now Im trying yet again. I dont really like the way I look and I want to lose weight but Ive been going to the gym  times a week for a year and havent seen any visible changes. That tells me my diet is the real problem. I know I have trouble with snacking at work so I try to keep veggies and hummus in my work fridge only buy healthy snacks chew gum if I feel like I want something to eat but am not really hungry etc...but its still really difficult.My biggest issue is my own mind. I am constantly going back and forth between I want to lose weightIm going to start counting calories and being very focused on this and feeling like Thats not healthy thinking I should let myself enjoy what I eat. Part of me wants to lose weight and knows that I need to be tracking calories in order to do it but part of me wonders how I can do that and still be positive and have a healthy mental attitude towards my body.
