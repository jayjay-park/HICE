7973187,0,t3_4og32p,So what do you all think? Is this impressive? Thinking about it... midst people are awake for  hour days and  hours of sleep. My phone could go  days without a charge.As you can see in the graph I used the phone mostly for this time period. I slept for  hours and while at work there were small periods of standby time. However this is quite the stretch for battery time. Also look that I still had  available at  hours. I was able to get close to  additional hours out of that . I spent a week of testing and tweaking to finally get it to this level. At this point given the long battery life I consider this phone the best I ever had EVER. I have to say that I now absolutely love this phone. Thoughts anyone?,S7Edge,d4c9fbp,1,t5_3cs6c

9488261,0,t3_5abiy9,You could probably disable it with EZ Package disabler but why bother? I dont use NFC or Samsung Pay so I disabled those packages but kept the Knox since I like having extra sandboxtype security to protect against malware. Please correct me if Knox isnt used for this purpose. Disabling it wont delete it off your phone anyways and tripping Knox through rooting will void your warranty.,S7Edge,d9imqc2,1,t5_3cs6c
