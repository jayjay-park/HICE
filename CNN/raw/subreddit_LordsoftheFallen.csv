2137403,0,t3_2j9gst,Well some areas are class locked youll need a certain spell to access such areas. NG allows you to unlock an additional spell tree by NG youll get the option to have all  skills trees unlocked. I imagine this doesnt add a whole lot of depth.,LordsoftheFallen,clbiej9,0,t5_2xjqz

2227059,0,t3_2kldnb,My game only crashed once a few hours in my specs are considerably lower x . I only lowered the textures and and the shadows to medium because framerate wasnt so smooth. After the first crash went on Steam and their was an update for LotF waiting downloaded that and started the game back up havent had a problem since.,LordsoftheFallen,clmwv93,1,t5_2xjqz

I spent over an hour on my own trying to find it and after that i checked multiple guides and playthroughs and asked here on reddit as well and I didnt get even a single hint at it. If that is the definition of right away to you then we have nothing else to discuss.And Im betting silent hill doesnt give you locked doors in NG that you can only unlock in NG.,LordsoftheFallen,clo9nry,3,t5_2xjqz

2259392,0,t1_clqyfru,Umm first death wasnt a bug. You leave the ring of fire and die. I respawned and just fell dead with zero chance to be able to recover it. Had other bugs too that caused single deaths. Never doubles. Others have also have had the same problem but Ok defend a horribly buggy game over the word of multiple players ,LordsoftheFallen,clqzcyn,1,t5_2xjqz
2260271,0,t3_2l3ek9,This boss gave me the most trouble out of the lot. Whenever he is about to summon his adds look around to see where the two pods appear from which the adds spawn from. If youre quick enough you can jump or roll into the pods to break them you can also attack them stopping the adds from spawning.Also try to keep the boss close to the little shrine things and try to get him to do his slam. When he does that the shrine will collapse and hes stunned for a bit letting you wail on him. It can be a bit tricky trying to manage where the boss goes when youve to run off and destroy the pods. If youve got the Rage skill its very handy. Whenever the boss is stunned after destroying a shrine slap it on and you can take off a good chunk of his health.Anyway yeah. Make sure youre fast and just destroy the pods to stop the adds from spawning it will help.,LordsoftheFallen,clr39c5,1,t5_2xjqz
2261979,0,t1_clralo5,I actually preferred a lot of the mechanics over Dark Souls. Combat felt more real despite it sometimes being a bit too heavy feeling.Its receiving a ton of criticism too mostly for the bugs and crashes. But i think a lot of the praise is deserved especially for a smaller developer. Getting this much exposure is good and they will learn a lot from it. Im hoping they will make a sequel or DLC which improves on replayability bugs and storyline  the three things I think need to be improved.,LordsoftheFallen,clraufa,2,t5_2xjqz
2262124,0,t1_clr6y80,Frankly thered be no real difference between a new IP and a sequel. You might not like the story but Dark Souls didnt have a great story either what it had was a fantastic world. A very vague ambiguous world.Lords of the Fallen doesnt quite have that yet and part of that is because its not as big a game and much of its backtracking through similar environments. A new IP wouldnt change the gameplay at all itd be the same but ideally polished. New IP doesnt automatically equate to a revolutionary game it just means a different story and setting.Id rather them flesh out the one theyve started and make that good then waste more time trying to come up with a new one and potentially fail on that too. Thats a huge risk that really isnt worth the time and money spent.,LordsoftheFallen,clrbhp5,1,t5_2xjqz

2280150,0,t1_clti6l2,To be fair its probably because you got better at the genre seeing as how you came from the souls games and already gained experience through those games.On every single souls game I beat every boss within  tries my first time through. Thats because I was already familiar with the style since I played Monster Hunter religiously. Even OampS only killed me once because theyre basically an easier Moonlight Tryst. Every first death was me screwing around and after that I just treated it like an easier version of Monster Hunter and would win every time.Thats probably the reason you found this game so easy. Its the reason why most people complained Dark Souls II was too easy. A genre can only be so difficult and once you figure out how it works a lot of that difficulty is gone never to be found again.,LordsoftheFallen,cltjlys,14,t5_2xjqz
2297743,0,t1_clvpbuz,Thanks!Yeah I get the same some hits on the Commander I was thinking I cant believe I didnt get hit there and then other times I felt a little saltyI saw that one load screen tip that mentioned not saving do we know if theres a reward yet?,LordsoftheFallen,clvpt4a,1,t5_2xjqz

7163454,0,t1_d1sc3fh,When I attack enemies Im pressed right up against them. Dont be afraid to get in their face. Just keep your shield up lock on and circle them. If you can go for the backstab otherwise wait for them to whiff an attack and then counter.This video shows the circling technique Im talking about being used on the first boss Ive beat the first two bosses and checkpoints have been frequent so far. There are  or  checkpoints between the first and second boss.,LordsoftheFallen,d1sezm6,2,t5_2xjqz
7435440,0,t1_d2mna8j,I usually just use a pole sword or a great axe. I think your great sword may be fine. You may however need to increase your strength. If you struggle with the titans in your first playthrough just use magic spells Ram Stab or Shift. Shift is a one hit kill but risky as recovery is long. It takes two for the others so wait for it to replenish and dodge his run swings. If you chose solace I cannot help on that class but you can use Prayer to distract them but on playthrough one you need to be quick to walk around them and attack before they destroy the ghost or attack you before you get it out. Without high strength and lack of good weapons the best tactic early on is magic.,LordsoftheFallen,d2nd1g3,1,t5_2xjqz

10688755,0,t3_5su8k8,gt first Lord WardenOut of the four Champion gave me the most trouble.  I defeated First Warden and Commander in one try and after figuring out how to survive Worhipers massive AoE I killed it on the next attempt.  I played through the game maintaining the lightest equipment burden and Champion attacks quickly and hits pretty hard so it took a few attempts to figure out how to get in close attack then get out without getting hit.,LordsoftheFallen,ddigsgt,2,t5_2xjqz
