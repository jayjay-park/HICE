2604160,0,t3_2pist7,I am of the opinion that Obamas confidence in air strikes being effective stems from his short term success in overthrowing Gaddafi and arming the anti Gaddafi elements in Libya. If it worked there then maybe it will work elsewhere in the Middle East. The problem with this however is that the dictators who are most effective in combatting terrorism there Saddam and Assad no longer have the support of the Americans or have been killed by them that America is rightfully seen by Middle Eastern powers as a nation who destroys middle eastern nations and then leaves the mess for others to deal with that by injecting more arms into the region it has caused even greater destabilisation that ISIS is not a state yet with longstanding political economic and social establishments which they can target as was the case in Libya and even that humans learn and can evolve their tactics and strategies so that by the time America started its bombing campaign in Syria and Iraq their methods used in Libya were already outdated and as a consequence useless.America is great at defeating states guerrilla warfare is a whole other form of warfare that it struggles with as have all great imperial powers throughout history. In a state there are transport targets and important state targets and army bases and communications bases which can be bombed with virtual impunity. Spot a tank battalion easily from the sky and you can blow them up. With ISIS this is definitely not the case. Syria and Iraqs highways and rail transport is already devastated its society fragmented its loyalties split. As a result the fighting is ruthless because the people are desperate to survive the ruins are a perfect breeding ground for extremism as well as hiding in and the sanctity for life is in short supply.Sending American soldiers into such a mess wrought by short term political thinkers who desire re election more than regional stability and corporate interests over ensuring the future of nations crippled by war. Instead of pledging billions in actually resolving the root cause of why terrorism is such an attractive proposition for young men and women it was funnelled into a corrupt government who had no interest in the people they were elected to represent and an ineffective army that collapsed at the first whiff of actual fighting.For every thousand hacking at the branches of evil there is one hacking at the root. In Americas case it is different. For every thousand hacking at the branches of evil no one was trying to even acknowledge the existence of a root cause to the problem let alone hack at it.The result is the mess today.,Isis,cmyi1oc,4,t5_2r31m

Whether youre Jewish or Christian or Muslim doesnt matter as long as youre ready to accept the sharia rule.Im not trying to make you do this though or dont do this. Im just saying it would a pretty foolproof plan if your main goal is to avoid conflicts with them.,Isis,ct97qzd,1,t5_2r31m
