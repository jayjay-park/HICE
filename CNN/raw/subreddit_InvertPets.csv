5312265,0,t1_cvqnsff,To be fair theres still a fair bit of color variation in both morphs so if you just got them online its not unreasonable to think that theyre the result of a selective breeding program instead of a single gene mutation.I knew otherwise because I started my orange colony from a single orange female I found in my yard and experimented with the color by crossbreeding them with wild ones while I built up their numbers.Anyway Ive also got Armadillidium nasatum peach and A. maculatum the zebra pillbug.The peaches have the same orange mutation as the orange P. scaber does. But the zebras arent a special breed thats just what the species looks like.Im also getting some dwarf whites Trichorhina tomentosa before the weather gets too cold.Theres a couple other species Ive been trying to get my hands on but theyre only available in europe and thus far Ive had no luck finding anyone willing to send any to me here in the US. Armadillidium werneri and Porcellio expandus are high on my list.,InvertPets,cvqpcs7,1,t5_342py
