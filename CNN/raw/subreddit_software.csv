1594231,0,t1_cjfvk91,The horrible choice of using VLC aside yes it is great works out of the box etc let me try to rephrase my case trying to focus on your original question.I wrote quite a bit... but I pretty much abandoned it because it was centered around this one point.From a monetary position its not worth it for big companies to provide such customization. The way many get around this is by providing APIs for extensions and having people who want those customizations to do it for them.In terms of the cost issue. If the cost of maintaining the code grows faster than the monetary growth rate per user then the size of the team is irrelevant. Its actually the case that as the team grows the overhead of running the team grows. The knowledge base grows and as attrition eats away at the team that costs more.Aside from this Im sure the companies rank new features and enhancements in the order of the number of users who want that feature. Being in the industry Im fairy certain that this is the reason. But Ill point out one more thing. You point out that the small thirdparty software is usually far superior right out of the box by default. Why do you want customizations then? You point out that from a functional perspective customizations arent needed. I know you said that thats not a reason to not have customizations. Seems worth pointing out though.So I guess the answer is this simple. They provide a superior product to others and they know youll buy it so dont feel they need to provide customizations.,software,cjg4frs,1,t5_2qh19

Id also recommend using Classic Shell it adds back in usability from Windows . Lastly extensions like Ghostery can help to keep your information safe from people who would use it to sell you something or otherwise do not have YOUR interests at heart.

I dont really feel bad about posting this publicly as this was only just released.The encryption is AESCBCgreat! the key is based on the given password with no saltnot so great. There is a separate key for each file type in FileZillaFileZillaXml SiteManagerXml RecentServersXml etc.    shaMasterPass  SHAmaster password    keybase  SHAshaMasterPass  file type    key.key  keybase...    key.iv  keybase...    key.magic  SHAfile type stored in file used to validate correct decryption    plaintextdata  headerkey.magic data size etc  actualdata    encrypteddata  AESCBCkey.key key.iv filedata    savetodiskencrypteddata file type  A big part of security in passwords is protecting users from themselves. Users are terrible at creating passwords. Im going to ignore reuse of the IV when saving files which is in general bad but maybe not terrible in the attack scenarios worried about the author here where its just to give the user time to find the problem prior to entering their password.Every file of the same type on every users computer saved with the password password will have the same exact first  bytes. Generating a rainbow table or creating a FileZilla Securespecific algorithm for hashcat would be easy and super fast here. You should look at scrypt andor PBKDF and generating a custom random salt peruser to use when creating the key. Try to tune the difficulty factor to . to  second to generate the key from the password. Store the salt in plaintext with or inside of the header for your files and you have a much more secure system.Im sure theres other attacks too but this is a good start. Thanks for your work here. Even without the changes I recommended your goal of making attackers work harder to get your password would have succeeded.tldrThis changes it so at an attacker could send your encrypted data to their servers and then decrypt it easily and at scale with most passwords under  characters and easily guessable passwords.With some minor changes you can make it very expensivenot worth it to crack passwords at all.,software,d9ozhid,3,t5_2qh19

Gradients and blending modes add depth and the ability to resize style and mathematically transform objects is a different approach than just painting pixel layers. Although the ability of raster programs and vector programs is blurring a lot as they mature. A lot of things that you only used to be able to do in Illustrator primarily vector you can now easily do in Photoshop primarily raster. Affinity Designer and Affinity Photo are easy replacements for Illustrator and Photoshop.I happen to like them both. Adobe and AffinitySerif. I tend to do my professional work in Adobe and my personal stuff in Affinity. Because I collaborate with other designers and we all have Creative Cloud licenses.

10441124,0,t1_dcr4e7j,My apologies for having you do combofix on your own. I forgot that this particular one needs extra help unlike the other programs and yes its www.bleepingcomputer.com not the other one with S after computer. The reason why I said to do this in safe mode or boot mode because when there are virusmalware programs running they usually reside in memory and if its still in memory most antivirus programs cant delete it unless you restart your computer. Most of the time they go undetected which is why you need to reboot into safe mode where most programs do not load into memory including virusmalware programs. Safe mode only loads the most critical .DLL files including basic drivers programs used to communicate between the OS and hardware which is why you see the resolution is at a lower setting rather than normal setting as well as base programs necessary to run Windows. Boot mode allows you to boot up the computer but just before the step where it loads the OS it will run the antivirus program beforehand then starts to scan the whole Windows partition for everything. This also prevent anything such as a basic .DLL or a vanilla driver from loading which is better than safe mode but unfortunately AFAIK not all AV programs offer this. Dell usually provide a basic hardware check which should be on the recovery partition this is the same partition where you can restore OS back to factory settings and can be accessed by restarting or starting up if your computer is off your computer and when the Dell splash screen comes on you see the options on the bottom of the screen and you would need to punch one of the Function F F F...F keys or maybe the Delete DEL key in order to access the recovery partition so you can initialize the hardware checker. Lets hope the tech guy who came over to restore your computer back to factory settings also had the recovery discs install a recovery partition so you can do this. The reason why the tech guy didnt let you have a recovery disc set is because its all about the . You gotta buy the discs yourself OR create them yourself. When you first got the computer did Windows or a certain Dell utility prompt you to create restore discs? i use restore and recovery interchangeably as it means basically the same thing Then you should have restore discs by now. If you havent and the recovery partition is still intact viruses can attack the recovery partition then you should still be able to restore Windows from the recovery partition. There are a couple of hardware checkers that are independent of all manufacturers but it requires a bit of tinkering around. You can download Hirens Boot CD and burn it to a disc or boot it off an USB flash drive and run it. Hirens has an array of utilities including hardware checkers HDD scan Memory test video card scans etc. Viruses can cause a series of issues which could trigger the event viewer to report these errors. For example if a .DLL file is not working properly because a virus has altered the file then event viewer will report the .DLL file to not be working or missing. Then it tries to load the .DLL file but it continues to be missing then event viewer will log it again and continues to log the error until the .DLL file is fixed or restored. This is why I suggested restoring the OS back to factory settings because your situation sounds like the OS got corrupted due to viruses. You can run a hardware check to ensure everything is working as they should then restore as this is the best option at this point for you. If youve exhausted all of your options on your own it might be for the best to bring your computer to a computer repair shop and have them run tests then restore OS as they probably have restore discs or will install OS from scratch. OR buy a new computer as your computer is very old and theres the possibility of a hardware failure that you would need to order exclusively from Dell. If the Hard Disk Drive HDD fails you can easily replace that and the same goes for memory but for the motherboard and the Power Supply Unit PSU you would need to order it from Dell as they are proprietary parts that can fit in the chassis. Buy a new computer to bring yourself current and I know Windows  may sound intimidating to some but its really easy to use if you apply the same knowledge from Windows  over to Windows . The basic functionalities are still there along with some new changes but it shouldnt require a lot of learning. You already know how to access event viewer you can do the same on Windows . Sorry this is a long read but I could have done this yesterday but it was getting late in the night for me. ,software,dcrkvmp,1,t5_2qh19
