Khan academy is a great resource for learning math independently and not having to pay for classes but it takes a lot of diligence to succeed. Set a schedule study make deadlines. Ive taught calculus for years and I would never recommend trying to take two of them at once. Ive had students get a bad passing grade in calc  and try to take both calc  and calc  at the same time they have always failed. However it is likely that you can take a math elective at the same time as a calc class depending on what the electives look like.,matheducation,chd4cdu,2,t5_2qluz

3555437,0,t1_cpx93iz,Youre on to something but not quite right.Variables  I hate this term because its not generally used in mathematics  are not always numbers. I will be calling variables by their general godgiven mathematical name symbols. And yes  is also a symbol. Its given an explicit meaning just like x is. Every scribble must be given a definition somewhere.The letter itself can stand for damn near anything. It can be a number a whole set of numbers something called a group a vector a vector space a topology a knot your shoes and so on. However we say what a symbol represents before we use it.  If Im writing a paper and say Let x be a real number you best believe that x behaves exactly like any real number you can name. For the purposes of algebra its a number. You just operate in such a way that you make no assumptions about which number it is.If you are trying to make it vary slightly different rules apply. It is conceptually still a real number at any given moment. If were plotting a graph we calculate any function at discrete points its still a real number here just sampled at a bunch of places.In calculus the situation becomes more complex.  Its still considered a real number but there is a great deal of hidden notation and definition that means when we say x is a real number and then do calculus relative to x were not really talking about x the real number anymore. Instead were comparing functions and saying something about which functions were referring to. The symbol x is not actually being discussed its just easier conceptually to teach students that way.Generally when you see a symbol defined as a real number and then used as though it varies is a place where youre talking about functions and describing the function in terms of an unknown rather than giving it a name.The confusion arises because fx  x is a function but is often written just as x. Whether were referring to x the real number or shorthand for fx  x the function is taken from the context.,matheducation,cpxjl3i,1,t5_2qluz

4812960,0,t3_3grxg5,yes allowing notes on tests is fineIt serves two purposes  reduces the stress of students by allowing them to spread their preparation over time and lock in studying on paper.   provides an opportunity for students with weaker study skills to have a concrete goal in mind the creation of a notesheet.I think it is best to restrict the sizelength of the notesheet.  You want students to confront the space problem so that they must filter their knowledge.  But you also want to allow students to be able to write an amount that is helpful to them.Usually students will report back that they didnt even use their notes!.  This is a great opportunity for you to ask them how they would improve it or also offer the observation that they did spend the time studying for the test at least.

However as he loses the fight he is weaker  Sines strength goes from  to . The risk of knockout  K.O. aka cosine  is growing as sine is being weaker and weaker. At the start of the game the risk of KO was .

7893054,0,t3_4nccie,Im a first year teacher and I teach history. Then all of a sudden a few weeks into the school year the school decided each student needed an additional math enrichment class. Which means they needed more teachers to teach math. Which means I a th grade history teacher had to teach one class of th grade math.Now I failed math twice in high school. I like math and Id love to be good at it but it doesnt come naturally. And I still knew way more math than those th graders. So while I made sure I did every problem with every step so I wouldnt mess up while teaching it I didnt often have issues with teaching it. I actually ended up enjoying it more than history some days. My th graders began coming to me for math help and I liked teaching it to younger kids even more. They were much more interested in learning math than the th graders. If the class finishes all of their work and have minimal behavior issues throughout the week the last  minutes of class on Friday is free time. Most kids choose to talk with friends or play on their phones but I had a lot of them asking me to do math with them which was fun.The thing I struggled with the most was connecting everything.

For example in your arc length discussion when you look at ex you write integrals and do not write the dx at the end until you catch it at the very end and squeeze them in. Everything you write should be correct in every way otherwise you teach bad habits in terms of process. Use equal signs when things are equal and all that you substituted in your function wrote a second integral missing the dx again and there was no equality written between them instead having partial related work not following normal conventions. Now Im looking at your solution and I have three integrals written in grammatically unrelated ways with a boxed number.

Many of these students have had years of horrible experiences with vegetables they know that  year olds are better at eating vegetables than they are. Very very few students can make it out of developmental math and actually pass a college level math class in a year nationally it is less than .What can you do? Keep shoving vegetables in their faces and complain when they dont like it? OF COURSE they dont like it! Does that mean that the whole endeavor is a lost cause? No but effective teaching developmental math requires a radically different approach than the one you are currently using. Address mindset. Carol Dweck and Jo Boaler are great resources. Students need to change the way they think of themselves and see themselves as capable of learning. There is no need to be something that you are not humorous or overlyexcited like a cheerleader. You can be yourself while still directly addressing the painful anxiety and unproductive mindsets they struggle with. You need to directly engage them in conversations and give ongoing support for them to develop a growth mindset. And it wont happen quickly.  You may also need to change your mindset. If a parent forces veggies on a kid it becomes an us vs. them power struggle. You cannot get them to do anything they dont want to do. Instead you all need to work together toward a common goal which should include comfort in the classroom first and working on math second. Lecture doesnt work. Study after study has shown that lecture is very ineffective compared to more active learning approaches see the Freedman report www.pnas.orgcgidoi.pnas.. Showing students how to do something is particularly ineffective for those who are already struggling with emotive and psychological issues.These students and I would argue all students need to construct their own understanding. They need to be authentically engaged in rich problems. They need to make sense of the math themselves. Math Pathways through Carnegie is a great resource and I have many more if you are interested. For example ask students which will taste more orangy the juice made with  cups of concentrate and  cups of water or the one made with  cups of concentrate and  cups of water. Why? Allow students to approach from any perspective and VALUE their informal ways of knowing.You say you have them do activities. How much work have you done to establish groupwork norms? Do people feel safe sharing their ideas with one another? How do you use their ideas from the small groups in whole class discussion? Choppins article TeacherOrchestrated Classroom Arguments in MT is a great resource but it is copywrited.I have a PhD in math and math education and in my opinion developmental math is by far the hardest class to teach.

What youre describing is the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.  A fixed mindset is like what your student was describing and a growth mindset is one where sustained effort results in growth and improvement.So how do you help a student develop this mindset?  That we dont  actually have a tight causeandeffect relationship identified for.  One thing I do is have my students watch the following two Ted talks with some of the original researchers of this.Ted Talk    Fixed Mindset vs Growth MindsetTed Talk    The Power of GritSo my first assignment in my math courses is that I have my students watch these videos and then answer the following two questions What did you learn from watching these videos? What actions can you take to help yourself develop a grittier and growthfocused perspective to learning mathematics?One of the most common actions I regularly make in my teaching is having a moment e.g.  or  minutes where I ask students to write down what they learned from X lesson or studying and what questions they still have.  I also praise my students early and often for identifying things that they have learned praise is one of  common motivating factors for learning mathematics.The research on motivation and selfefficacy delves much deeper into these topics and what we know and dont know about them.gt  I wish I knew how to actually convince my students of this success with sustained effort.This is a million dollar question.  The reason this is hard is because it is rooted in ones beliefs about themselves.  Most people have the misconception that you either are or are not a math person.  What I do in my teaching is try and point out all of the things that I notice my students doing differently andor learning about and praise them for it.
