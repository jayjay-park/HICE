10220042,0,t3_5mb5wv,Saw them supporting Breaking Benjamin in . It was a great show! The drummer was phenomenal and I loved his little stick tricks to bring excitement to the show but Im looking forward to see them at ROTR!,Starset,dc2hzfm,4,t5_32378
10415867,0,t1_dcnw9np,I have seen them  times and will see them a th in chicago tomorrow.  None of my videos come close to doing them justice.  I dont have a camera good enough to pick up the audio properly and the visuals also require a better camera.  The overall experience is amazing.  I heard them with Breaking Benjamin for my first time and I went out of my way to find out more about them after that.  The second time I saw them was acoustic and it was amazing as well.  rd time I did the VIP and the experience in the small room was so much fun.  Great group of guys.,Starset,dcopg2o,5,t5_32378
10629738,0,t1_ddcb8nl,Yeah but in all seriousness I found it through a facebook page that makes lots of acapellas and stuff and Telescope was there popping and gleaming from the arsenal. this is the URL  and theres also a piano version with vocals of Telescope that someone made and it sounds amazing Ill share it on the sub soon,Starset,ddcdkg5,2,t5_32378

10960715,0,t1_deaa0w3,Not the person youre asking but Everglow would be on the bottom for me for the same reason Dark On Me my bottom song from Transmissions. Not a fan of slower mellower songs with prominent vocal emphasis.,Starset,deaiql4,2,t5_32378
11002638,0,t1_def2woq,Yeah the show I was at had a tiny venue and I could barely see her too. She needs to have her own pedestal and spotlight dammit. ,Starset,def482h,1,t5_32378
11264081,0,t3_60hz21,Stardust grew on me the most I think. It used to be the song I liked the least on the album but now I really enjoy it.Back to the Earth and Everglow have lost some of their appeal to me but as many have said already I still love this album and all of its songs. I definitely like this album better than Transmissions personally.,Starset,df8rmp0,2,t5_32378
