Im sure you work for a franchise am I correct? You need to get in touch with a DVP or FAO and get this sorted out maybe even a lawyer and sue these guys.EDIT post this to rlegaladvice someone with way more law experience can help you on what to do next as well.,wendys,cvwlayx,1,t5_2t32k

9879833,0,t3_5fxpoy,gt Wendys new Spicy Sriracha Chicken Sandwich features our iconic Spicy Chicken topped with a one of kind Sriracha Jack Cheese thickcut Applewood Smoked Bacon creamy Sriracha aioli spring mix and red onion all served on a toasted Srirachainfused bakerystyle bun.I had this yesterday and was very disappointed mostly because the fried chicken was dry fairly hard and tasteless. After being pretty good for awhile the quality at my local Wendys has turned inconsistent. Even the bacon was overcooked and too hard. I really should have sent it back. As for the sandwich itself I dont think the ingredients worked well together. The Sriracha sauce was maybe a little spicier than the Sriracha sauces from McDonalds and JackintheBox but still fairly mild. The Sriracha Jack cheese looked more like a nacho cheese sauce. I didnt taste anything different in the Srirachainfused bakerystyle bun. ,wendys,davd601,2,t5_2t32k
