3074326,0,t1_cogmnac,I suggest keep getting free cat food first. if you run out at all you cant do the hack again sadly... I dont know why.Alright so get Game Killer out first.Then go to your Storage. Search  on Game Killer. You should have a bunch of results.Now close it not totally close but you know what I mean and use the  gacha jackpot. Now go on to Whatever cat it landed on search for its ID on the release order.Now when you find that ID search it on Game Killer. You should get a bunch of results again.Now change the cat to XP. Search  again on GK. You should have a few results.Use the  gacha again. Look at one of the IDs on GK change from  to a random number. The random number is the Cat ID. Change the Cat ID to another one eg.  Crazed Cat. Now use the cat that shows up.If done correctly instead of showing the cat you pulled on the Gacha it should show the Cat you are trying to get.Its really easy. And you can do this over and over as long as you dont close GK when you find the ID value or if you type in the wrong value and it crashes.Hope I helped!,battlecats,cognh6j,0,t5_2tsiy

3694937,0,t3_32pchw,Copy pasted from another thread but... I wrote it and it might help. Its a small guide for Chapter  MoonIf you arent familiar with meatshield spamming like my friend you might have trouble with this stage.I tried to talk about my friend while he was having trouble with Chapter   Moon and noticed these mistakeserrors. Mostly focusing on his stronger catsYou shouldnt focus on your stronger cats you should ALWAYS keep your priorities on your meatshields Macho Wall and Samba. Your second priority should be your Dragon Cat since he has a long range and a decent attack. Having a messy line upPersonally I find lineups to be a huge pain when everything is scattered everywhere. You should always keep it organised and put your meatshields together so you can spam them faster rather then flipping your menu. Having SalonParis can help.I dont know about you but if you have SalonParis cat you should use it. Grouping it with your meatshields is a good idea since SalonParis cooldown is identical to the meatshields.How did my friend beat it? I noticed he was always focused on his bath cat lol and his whole lineup being messy. I changed his lineup so that he could only have  cats and focus on spamming those instead. Those five are gtMachogtgtWallgtgtSambagt gtParisgtgtDragon And it guess what? It produced results because he had no choice but to use those cats and hell spam them way faster than usual since he only has  bar to use.Right now I think your priority should beat your  meatshields your Dragon cat and Sexy Legs.

Slow movement so you can probably stack her with Bahamut. Marauder Cat on the other hand is born to destroy metal stages. His  chance to crit and AoE damage makes most of them a breeze with proper support.

Strategy is to play meatshields and kasa jizo until you start stacking some money.  Depending on the level you will either use the money to start sending paris and sexy legs if you arent advancing or just send out your ubers if you are advancing to the base.  In any case extra money should be spent on ubers.  Once you get close to the base start sending giraffe and lion to help take down the base fast.  Giraffe and lion dont help much against enemies so dont use them until you get close to the base unless you have extra cash.I chose these ubers because they are the fastest I have.  I think they are actually some of the fastest in the game.  Peach angels is the best because it is super fast.  Raiden is also pretty fast.  Megidora moves fast but has a long attack animation so he is lowest priority here.  Also you might want to replace crazed sexy legs with crazed ufo since you can spam it more easily.,battlecats,cscy31w,1,t5_2tsiy

4966541,0,t3_3ixheq,Just read through the blog entry and comments and I think I should give some of my thoughts here CatEnemy Stats I suggest using  tables  for HP and Damage level dependant for cats magnification dependant for enemies  for the rest of the stats independant of levelmagnification. The HPDamage table can list the stats for multiple levelsmagnifications. Also can we convert some confusing stats into easier to understand ones frames to seconds for example? Cat index shortcut is idk sounds nice but is not much useful for me as an enduser. Most of the time I went to the wikia I search for the cats name since I cant remember the cats index anyways.  Contents ProsConsUsageStrategy I believe they should be address with regards to Progress Form Role and Rarity. How to addess that need much more discussion and input from many players. Vandalism I noticed some but they are gone soon in most case. Good job wikia team! Criticism and lack of help from Reddit Im ashamed to say that Im one of the guys criticising wikia for inaccuracy at times but did nothing to help except pointing that out. Really sorry to you guys about that.I havent tried to touch the wikia at all afraid of screwing up things.

5025386,0,t1_curgr0j,No problem! And ticket farming although boring is very beneficial im at  user rank now and in large part its come from ticket farming over  runs of the siege of metal hippo and  of the super metal. Itll help greatly with user ranks and getting true forms especially once you have Eraser cat. And once your base upgrades are at . You can trade in  upgrades that you cant use for a gold cat ticket. Which netted me an uber night before last. You can check the reoccuring stages on the side bar and time travel to get the siege stage  for a cat ticket. at almost any time in the month. And it can be beaten with just giraffe cat. Ive noticed now that i have all the base upgrades when farming silver tickets. I can get a rare ticket at least every  silvers. And farming the  stage although a little harder takes me about  minutes to get  tickets. Depending on crits. But i wouldnt suggest doing that one without a couple of crit cats. I use jurassic cat sitter and island. You can alsonget crit cats from the cyclone stages. ,battlecats,curr0uz,2,t5_2tsiy

I dont know if you have any other antireds other than Pirate and Witch is pretty good same as Pirate only shes slow instead of knockback and Jurassic is a nice crit attacker. The reason I dont think you should level up Rocker unless you have spare XP is because you have Gamereon Taro.

You should save up cat food to roll a guaranteed uber preferably on the Ultra souls and dragon emperors any one of the uber in those sets will make your life much more easier. As for cow cat true that hes pretty weak but a high lvd cow cat could help you farm treasures with his fast speed amp recharge. Fish cat will have use in lategame as an antired amp critical hitter after getting his true formlv so dont sell those capsules and use them!Your super rares are meant for lategame enemies angels amp aliens but still good. And your uber keiji can help you out in the hard weekend xp stages which features black enemies that keiji can be used against. I suggest you to only upgrade him if you have spare xp as the xp cost to upgrade him is quite high.Once you got all the treasures in all  chapters you should be able to beat chapter  moon. check out nurse wuffas channels for walkthroughs in later stages ,battlecats,cxmm0e9,1,t5_2tsiy

6140199,0,t1_cymqg8o,Im not sure how you would beat this level but if it helps I used this lineupRow  crazed cat eraser crazed wall Paris level  Drama Row  Yukimura  Bahamut  Raiden  Ururun  Catman EDIT Just to be clear this was a really close run and it was the first time I beat the stage without Rich cat. second time overall. Lenoir was about a centimeter away from hitting my base after the two Bun Buns died and without a lucky Ururun proc I may have gotten wrecked. We will never know.You should probably bring cat CPU and Rich cat. Sniper cat not recommended. Try uNyanholotops lineup.The problem was that Yukimura was only used to deal massive damage to Kurosawah and the dark Ottas and at the end to Lenoir. He maybe got one hit in on the double Bun Buns then got OHKOd because they were synced. Raiden was used for his great DPS but not sure if that was a great choice at least among my selection of heavy hitters. I didnt use rich cat though which would help you a LOT. Here goes a sort of guideFirst stage before Kurosawah spawns You need to kill that Dark Otta or at least get  knockback plus a lot of damage before Kurosawah spawns and knocks you back. You also need a lot of room on the board so you have some breathing room. Second stage Here you can probably stall Kurosawah and the weak peons that spawn with him build up your wallet etc for as long as you like. The next stage is triggered by hitting the base.Third stage Here goes! Bringing cat cpu is probably extremely useful for the perfect meatshield spam. Gory Black Shadow Boxer K and doge dark will be spawned at regular intervals as well as that double Bun Bun and Lenoir constantly pushing. Here absolute maximum DPS is required and mostly area attack at that because without that sync you are definitely screwed. Getting bad flashbacks from Black Premonition? You will be slowly pushed back but once you kill the two Bun Buns the stage is basically over. Be careful still though as Lenoir will consistently kill your stack of ParisDrama cats and the black enemies have enormous pushing power when left alone. Try to keep Ururun alive during this stage.,battlecats,cynkram,1,t5_2tsiy

I would rate Asiluga over Kubiluga and maybe Balaluga mainly because Asiluga can actually kill trash and slows for a longer period of time over Balas freeze. Baby over Lesser Demon. The shockwave hits hard enough to kill stacked crap. I prefer Kenshin over Keiji but thats just me. Oda Nobunaga is personally a tad overrated since hes significantly worse than Ice in terms of stats despite being able to permafreeze without a Cat Combo also Reds are generally more of a problem than Blacks. Kalisa over WindyThundia. I like high movement speed and low recharge. Vars is better than Sodom since Vars actually have movement speed. Sodom is slow as hell...And things are going to change again in BCJP v. so its all temporary for now. ,battlecats,d1wg7kn,1,t5_2tsiy

The shy boy will come out before it dies. Do NOT send out WampP during this time but do spam Jizo. Both face creatures should be dead by the time CyberFace reaches you. He will kill everything. Once the shockwave is COMPLETELY over send out all critical hitters. Cyberface will either die or attack and  shot your base. If he dies send out WampP and spam Jizo. As soon as Megidora recharges send him out. When A. Bahamut recharges time him carefully preferably after the face has been knocked back. Depending on your timing you should be able to kill the base.Alternatives  meatshieldsMoneko. Probably not necessary if you just restart just before you die. All RNG so Moneko probably wont help.Can Greater Demon take a hit from the face? If so use him instead of Megidora and use in the same way.Megidoras knockbacks messing you up? Bring Togeluga instead.

7815823,0,t3_4mdazg,Marauder is fantastic. Cheap short cooldown very high crit chance. Hell basically end your problems with metal enemies. Only things to look out for when using him is that hes slow and close ranged so youll wanna make sure you can protect him a bit before just throwing him out there. And he is definitely not a multitasker. Terrible for anything except metal. But on metal he wrecks house like nobodys business. I think some people like Hayabusa more but I only have Marauder so I couldnt say why. But honestly with Marauder and Hurricat Ive really never felt the need to try to get Hayabusa. Marauder and maybe occasionally one or two of the effect units from the cyclones has handled every metal enemy Ive come across. ,battlecats,d3uk9z4,5,t5_2tsiy

I only have  ubers but I know almost the entire dictionary through this. AS usnave pointed out the ubers in each set show up in their CRO.I can give you thisFirst row is Dynamites I dont know all of them. First one is Baby I think. EDIT According to uBuster the Dynamites go in the order of Ice Machine Demon Marauder Baby NurseSecond row is Wargods that go KeijiYukiOdaMasamune and Shingen idrKenshinThird and th row are Galaxy Gals and reskins Windy Hallowindy Thundia Spooky Tundia Kuu Santa Kuu Kai Frosty Kai Coppermine Holy Coppermine Kalisa Tropical KalisaNext pageFirst row is Dragons Im missing Megidora and Raiden respectivelySecond row is Ultra Souls I dont remember off the top of my head but the first one we know is Momo cuz it has TF and its not Kaguya.Third row is AkiraMekakoCatmanRabbitSummer RabbitPierre and then Hayabusa in the last row with the  Almighties.Final pageThe fourth one in the first row is Teco since it has TF. Im pretty sure  and  are Asil and Kubi respectively.Second row is PaiPai REI then Gao followed by MolaMSD collabs. I think Mola King comes first but IDK the rest.My info might not be too useful but it might save you some time from searching through the WikiSpicas CROs.

9948459,0,t3_5hzwhl,Well Zeus isnt bad at all in my opinion! Hes pretty well rounded with good range health and DPS. Baby cats is a tragedy though. I know your pain. Someone convinced me to waste my time and energy and XP in order to TF him and it wasnt even worth it because he STILL dies almost immediately. Frosty Kai is still pretty useful but thats coming from someone who went the majority of the game with no tanks and knows that struggle up until got taro a month or two ago THANK GOD. Dont know where youre at in the game but Ive found Ultra Souls generally to be more useful out of everything else coming up. Id hope for Taro Jizo or Momotaro. Galaxy Gals are pretty good too Thundia amp Windy are pretty well rounded ubers. Out of those uber sets the good ones are awesome and the bad ones still arent terrible so its less of a gamble.In my opinion nekolugas SOUND great but their slow as hell attack rate kind of ruins their usefulness for me. Id rather focus on either galaxy gals or ultra souls or just binge watching ads for catfood and hope theres a guaranteed for something good soon... also I personally would prefer the user rank over XP...thats what weekend stages are for especially if you spend the majority of Wednesday collecting XP ups. Plus theyve been putting out a lot of XP megablitz stages recently. There isnt any way to get to up your rank without drawing dups of cats further on so... longterm cat rank is better since XP is easier to come by but thats just my opinion.,battlecats,db4b5yv,1,t5_2tsiy

If you do get it to work I wrote a guide on how to save time when scumming for the uber you want. Aphrodite is in group C along with Poseidon Ganesha is in group B along with Anubis. So you dont need to try all possible combinations as others might have you do and Ive heard that the iTunes backup process takes a million years so best to avoid it if possible.EDIT Also you can never be told too many times to note down your inquiry code ,battlecats,dccaul0,1,t5_2tsiy

11680581,0,t3_66o9ez,UFO cat absolutely destroys outbreaks its good to get a few treasures in chapter one but dont go megafarming right away you only really need to do it when you need to plus after getting all the treasures youre sure to have raked in heaps of XP! I would prioritise clearing empire of cats mainly chapter . You should also try to get treasures during festivals where the treasure drop rates are greatly raised! Stories of legend can also get you heaps of xp but is much more difficult... although you do get a handsome  catfood after clearing a chapter. As of where you are now the xp stages arent to be that useful for you. Just a helpful tip Try to never spend cat food and save rare tickets for events like epicfest or uberfest the only time you should spend cat food is to do an draw on a guaranteed event! Facing danger becomes available after beating into the future chapter . If you want to power up quick then treasures stories of legend and events in general are the way to go! You could spend actual money if you want I have a friend who spent over  Aus I think thats like  us you cant really farm YET but as I said UFO is really good for outbreaks they become WAY more difficult in empire of cats chapter  and  so beware of that. Also just so you know you can display all of your cats with a google sheets page! like this! Great job on clearing the moon btw! Now that you can access SoL stories of legend and events you can easily boost your gameplay really well! Idk if youd be interested but you can go to rbattlecatscheats to cheat if your that sort of person. Once you beat the chapter  moon you can collect catfruit to evolve some cats into their third forms! Plus you get really good Cats from beating chapter  and chapter ! You are WAY to early into the game to farm anything other than treasure but I wouldnt do that until I had the energy power up at the highest I can get it! Remember that you can always check the wiki or post to the mega thread to get some help on stages the wiki offers a more general approach but if you create a spreadsheet and post it to the mega thread you can get a specialised and theres a thing called the battle cats spica that you can use to get the exact stats of your cats! Its Japanese so it may take some time to get used to it but Im ok with it and I have never spoken or read any Japanese ever! ,battlecats,dgk0dzy,4,t5_2tsiy
