Also they will check to see if he assuming he is in fact a boy is neutered.  If not that should be done ASAP as intact male cat urine will make your eyes water its so pungent.

The Under Armour Performance Combine Center is closer to your typical gym and is located in Locust Point. Its  a month no sign up fees or contracts. Classes are extra and the hours are good but theyre closed Sundays. Realistically Merritt isnt that bad price wise if you use the pool and take advantage of the classes.

1213133,0,t1_ci5zfja,Hey mate Apologies for the late reply it was bed time here in Sydney. Dublin can be a bit like that. We got a lot of tourists there especially during the summer months.Youll find a lot of people from there tend to hang out a little bit out of the city but might go out late at night in the city to the clubs and stuff. but yeah it is weird we dont really hang out a huge amount in the city itself. Much like any city I guess if you know a few people there and where they go it can be a really fun city.Hhhmmm the best part of Australia compared to Ireland? Thats a tough one. I havent seen a huge amount by any means. Melbourne is a cool city. Its bar culture and stuff is really different to most places Ive been to. Sydney is different again as its got beaches and stuff less then  minutes drive to the city the beautiful harbor and is sports mad. If youre bored someday you should cast your eye over the sports they play here. NRL which is a different form of Rugby only really played I the UK and Australia. And then theres Aussies rules. The word rules is misleading as it is a fast paced and physical game where brawls break out pretty frequently. My favorite place is  I go there on Holiday every year with my girlfriends family. Its this tiny little town. We pretty much rent out all the houses in the area and youre right beside this like km beach with no one on it. Loads of Surfing snorkeling fishing and lawn bowls. Its also an annual tradition to make a batch of magic brownies and go geocaching! Yep outside of the city you do see a fair few spiders. Theyre not everywhere its more in the rural areas. When I arrived here my girlfriend and her mother took me to here  to show me how few of the spiders are lethal as Im fucking terrified of spiders. So they take me here and into the spider section and go ok look at this one it cant ki....Oh wait it says that one can kill you. But the next o....oh. that can kill you too. Out of the  spiders they showed me  of them can really mess you up. Up in Queens land in the forests and stuff though thats where you get spiders that can eat birds and stuff.

Between  and  there were anywhere from  to  pedestrian fatalities per year total.  It was . per year on average.  It is possible there was a big spike.  It is also possible they cherry picked their data and didnt bother to do even the most basic analysis.There may just maybe also be some mitigating factors as well.  Such as high traffic volume or a fairly high rate of miles walked per person Maryland is one of the highest.  Im sure there are also areas Baltimore lacks such as good pedestrian infrastructure.  I know at least some busy intersections dont have crosswalks at all four possible crossings.But if everyone wants to just use this as an excuse to vent about how bad Baltimore driverspedestriansboth are thats cool too.,baltimore,cjck1mn,1,t5_2qipq

The machines will also generally have a sticker on them describing how to use them and what muscle groups it works.But yea as the other guy said trainers are a good resource for this. Having a workout buddy with some experience is a cheaper way to learn. x and rippetoes are good starting strength programs with simple compound lifts. Can be a little repetitive in the beginning  but its good to develop your base strength. Bodybuilding.com has a page that goes over all sorts of lifts and how to do them correctly. rfittness is also a great sub.I currently use Merrit its a great gym with lots of locations and fits those from beginner to advance levels well. As for using your phone. Why not? Its great to keep a journal of your workout I do keep mine on my phone. I would actually advise you to at least keep a note book log your workouts.

2815830,0,t3_2sbi9s,I hope I dont get buried.  I live in south Baltimore area  permit and its a disaster.  why is it a disaster?  because everyone knows that parking will suck after pm thus a self fulfilling prophecy happens.  everyone rushes to get a spot by  and never moves.  meanwhile  blocks away where it isnt permitonly usually has open parking spaces because there is still churn caused by nonresidents parking.  its actually easier to find a spot in the nonpermit area than the permit area.    meanwhile I cant have friends over for a party or barbecue because I only have  guest pass.  add that to the fact that you have to go through the hassle of taking time off work to get a permit so that you dont get a ticket and its a disaster.   TLDR  RPP makes it harder to find parking harder to have friends visit and harder to avoid getting a ticket yourself.  although it does make sense during games,baltimore,cno5i3z,10,t5_2qipq

CV is a really nice area I currently live there...there is crime every where but no where near as bad as most of the city....neighbors are really nice there too.Try Charles Village Apartments...there is a rental sign on th and Charles Street with their number...They do not do much business online but they have awesome prices when it comes to apartments in that area.

However it does not comment as to whether there are more black kids out past curfew than white.  I am not saying there is or is not but the data presented does not suggest that cops are looking the other way toward white kids or letting them go while not doing so for black kids yet that is what the article implies.  Also right or wrong the neighborhoods of the city that have the greatest crime  thus greatest police presence  are typically predominantly black.  I of course do not support unequally applying this or any law.  Statistically of the total kids picked up roughly  should be black and  white as that reflects the citys demographics though it may be different amongst the citys children.,baltimore,cnq0t8c,4,t5_2qipq

Best case scenario is the city forces a sale and private companies take over. The city is free of the burden and the land is more likely to be redeveloped. This is a huge step in the right direction. The new law will make is much easier for city inspectors to issue vacant building notices on the property and in turn force repairs or sale.

Also there is no risk other than lost time. If you go see an agent you do not have to pay for their services as they are paid by the hotels and cruise lines on the back end and you dont have to sign anything until you are ready to buy. There was no pressure to do anything. The agent took our email and followed up with us when new deals popped up sporadically.

Each of their extended areas have their own rail system all of which connect. Mississaugas rail system connects to Torontos TTC etc.The only thing Toronto has not going for it is their connection to their airport thats one thing Baltimore has down. Getting to Pearson is a pain in the ass via public transport but thats because its literally outside of Toronto proper.Of course DC has that problem as well with Dulles theyre working to fix that with the silver line.Heres the complete TTC Transit Map of Toronto They even have bus service from AM to AM.Also fun fact Toronto wasnt that big from the outset.

3478060,0,t1_cpop613,I agree that we should not expend resources to the degree that we are perusing real gang threats.  I also agree that sending them to prison is not a good answer.  community service is an option a work program could be an option.  it costs over k a year to keep a person in prison in maryland and often makes the offender worseoff in the long term.   .  when I was a teenager they had jobs programs for atrisk kids and adults I believe where the state would pay  of the wage of the kid while the employer paid the other .  this gives work experience a relationship with an employer many kids were hired after the end of the program and the employer does not have to risk as much money by hiring them full time.  it worked out well for me I got extra money after school and learned a few things in the process.  at the cost of modern prisons you could probably pay  of the wage to kids and still come out ahead.  nothing defeats criminal behavior like a good lifestyle and the fulltime job that provides it.  also maybe combine it with counseling to help prevent destructive behavior.  letting them turn MadMax is not the answer. ,baltimore,cpoq36a,3,t5_2qipq

3488455,0,t1_cppwd1e,First redevelopment doesnt mean that all of the poor people get the boot. Some poor people own homes some poor people will manage to swing the rent increases perhaps by landing a new job. So the redevelopment will directly benefit at least some of these people. The redevelopment will also indirectly benefit everyone in the city because increased tax dollars means more money for cops schools roads etc. And as far as peoples emotional investment in their home I can only help but think that it is antiquated notion. Even so it is at best an emotional reason and not a rational one to reject redevelopment.  Though I am a bit of a dick I actually have a very open mind. I spend my days dealing with the people from these broken neighborhoods trying to help them get their shit together. It sometimes results in some jaded perspective but I am interested in seeing evidence that other options might do more. As I see it however what you preach sounds like the same stuff people said about housing projects welfare programs job readiness programs etc... etc... And while those things might work if they were ever fully funded they never  ever  will be. And truth be told even if they were fully funded the problems in the city go much deeper than lack of opportunities. I firmly believe that the problems facing these neighborhoods starts and ends in the homes the kids grow up in. Drugs single parent households incarceration and violence are a part of almost every kids life in certain parts of the city. Until that changes nothing else likely will. Regardless I am going to bed.

They were probably .Much of the more outrageous behaviour is probably coming from younger people who have no real investment in whats going on and are probably excited by all the action taking place and using it as an opportunity to let loose.I come from the UK and a few years ago there were huge weeks long riots all over London and parts of the UK after a man was shot by police. It started with protests by well meaning members of the community and quickly erupted into all out violence and looting by young people with zero affiliation with the original group... there were young people of all races and wealth yes even privileged white kids getting involved... it was ridiculous. Its sad really. There was a time when young people were the ones idealistically fighting for causes and standing for whats right in the face of older opposition. Seems like there are lots of kids today who have zero comprehension about that sort of thing and wouldnt know where to start if they had a cause.

I agree that the money used to pay police during the riot was a waste since close to  buildings were burned and they were not even allowed to protect private property. Not sure why they were even paid if private property was destroyed. Easiest solution to the problem is to loosen gun control laws in the city and repeal the Firearm Owners Protection Act of  that prevents the ownership of automatic weapons. When dealing with mass lawlessness the most effective form of self defense is a firearm that can keep numerous people at bay. Might not be the most popular solution but looking at the LA Riots the use of automatic weapons prevented the destruction of many businesses and saved many lives by allowing outnumbered business owners to keep dozens of rioters at bay. ,baltimore,cr43ebx,0,t5_2qipq

Yes that is why I support abolition of the estate tax and lower taxes all around. The estate tax doesnt impact any more than a handful of families.

Being a child of a single mother is a large risk factor for leading to a cycle of crime and incarceration.

4264038,0,t3_39n23e,When you look at your bill on page  Important Information About Your Bill.  And then it says The price for SOS will cost .centskWh beginning June   through September  .  The price for Oct    May  will be set in May which it was and without looking it up in particular is .ish before the last bit of adjustment down if someone has their June bill the more accurate rate it should be in there.  Your Electric Choice ID  which you need to change suppliers  is on top of page .Basically that tells you the rate for the next year.  Now the other thing to know is that the supply price of .ish is only about s of the rate.  The rest is various fees.  So the actual rate youll pay to BGE is around .kWh.  So to recap  the current price to compare is .kWh for residential use.  And a movement of . off the supply price is about . difference in the total price youll seeThis is the price you want to compare to other suppliers.  So next up.  There are variable rates there are fixed rates.  There are various lengths of contracts.  There are contracts with cancellation fees there are contracts WITHOUT cancellation fees.  There are several services that will compare some of the suppliers but as near as I can tell none of the comparison guides cover all of the suppliers.You are probably best off staying with the big guys years ago I switched to a provider that went belly up  I automatically got switched back to BGE but that was not fun.   So WGL  aka Washington Gas Light BGE Home aka Exelon ConEd Solutions NRG CQI Associates which is a coop that started in Columbia etc.I just switched from ConEd Solutions when my contract was up. I went with NRG at .kWh. HOWEVER its that for  months and then goes variable with a circuit breaker of  so in month four it could go as high as .kWh.  I plan to switch again at month  which gets me cheapish electricity all summer for a savings of month over BGE hey I like my acOkay  so   which is also a local company btw  sort on rate and it tells you that DiscountEnergys variable rate is currently the lowest....but its VARIABLE.  gives you another set of suppliers sorted by rate.  chooseenergy.com gives yet another set of suppliers.  Now lets say you want a contract of a year or less give or take  you look at the sites and noting that NRG and CQI arent listedYou notice that WGL has a price of .kWh until December.  So six months with a month cancellation fee.  Now you ponder  how much does that save me exactly?  Well you look at the past usage of this place.I average about kWh in the worst of summer in my house.  So ..  ..  Huh.  So ConEd has about the same price.    So best case scenario on those plans is that you save month if you use about kWhmonth.    Is it worth that amountmonth to you to deal with this?  Knowing that the rates can go up or down every yearish do you want to deal with this?  Yes?  No?  If you do just remember  dont sign up for ANYTHING that is higher than the price to compare.  Thats just crazy.  Also if you have natural gas you can pick a supplier for that as well.  I have WGL for my natural gas via CQI Associates.  tldr  yes you CAN switch your electric and natural gas suppliers.  At the moment its not particularly worth it for electricity unless you are incredibly attentive to your bills and can deal with watching the contracts and deals guilty as charged here or use have a particularly high amount of usage.tldr the tldr  at the moment its probably not worth it to you to choose another electric supplier.,baltimore,cs69x1f,2,t5_2qipq

All of the discovery. Theres a HUGE difference between the two as the discovery includes loads of information that would never be admitted into evidence at trial. Thanks for being too lazy to read an entire newspaper article.gt Then the defense would move to have the charges dismissed when they have the evidence presented to them? One would certainly hope so. Do you have a problem with innocent people going free when exonerating evidence comes to light? Do you not believe in holding elected officials accountable when its revealed that they prosecuted someone on baseless charges? Everyone has a right to know when state officials persecute people despite the fact that there is compelling evidence of their innocence.gt  No case law to back up her claims? Thats right. She couldnt find any cases where defense attorneys were sanctioned for publicizing exonerating information and neither can you.  gtIts a fucking injunction they happen all the timeYou dont think motions for injunctions cite case law to justify the injunction??? Holy shit you are insane. And thats setting aside the fact that Mosby actually did cite case law in her motion.

I dont think Batts could have handled it any other way though. His hands were tied because of Ferguson. Tensions were high and any use of force by the police might have been countered with gunfire. Another thing police are upset about is that so many people are filming them whenever they appear anywhere in uniform.  Officers walk around areas surrounded by clouds of phones.  When they respond to calls people film them from all around. Officers get aggravated because people wont stop filming and sometimes loudly yelling about the fact that they are filming. So the police ask the person who just called  if they want to go to the station to finish upfile a crime report. Oddly enough not many people are keen in jumping into a BCPD carvan at the moment so many cases are just dropped right there.The way some of the officers want to respond is by stopping patrols.

When the only people hiring in your neighborhood are drug dealers selling to people coming in from the county down Edmondson do you think its not a rational choice to start selling also?

4825623,1,t1_cu2snr9,Thanks for the input on the website.As far as your questions youve hit the two big macro points that folks where are discussing. The Right Rail initiative is a great place to start on mass transit  That is a proposal that would cost far less than the failed Red Line and unite the fractured mass transit already in the City.However in addition the City needs to take a handsoff approach to Uber and Lyft fix the timing of street lights on major thruways encourage private companies with large numbers of employees to create shuttle services with offsite parking like Johns Hopkins already does and to encourage additional use of the Baltimore Water Taxi. While none of these proposals by itself would constitute a magic fix for transportation ills they would go a long way to show Annapolis that the City is committed to making a difference.With regard to covering funding for the short term losses in revenue I have to first dispute that these types of losses would amount to significant shortfalls. I see rentersprospective owners buying and paying taxes right away who would otherwise have not been in the City. However I fully support audits of any City program that is taking more than a million dollars out of the General Fund in a given year. With the books opened I would anticipate finding numerous areas where the City could be saving thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.,baltimore,cu2t4z8,4,t5_2qipq

They are a non profit so those millions are being spent not put into a pocket. Have you ever taken macro economics? Non profits arent going to pay taxes. Besides do you honestly expect the city to spend that money? Or would you rather have JHU put it into programs that help the city run and pay middle class families who spend money at local businesses to drive our economy? Those local businesses pay property income and sales taxes and give you a job. I highly recommend looking into incentive programs and youll see that many large for profit companies likely have tax exemptions were given free land to develop and may even be paid by cities to come to them.

5762401,0,t3_3u2th3,I always find it interesting dealing with people from the surrounding Counties that never step foot into this city for anything besides a RavensOrioles game.  Hard lining it on the first light rail car back to their suburban castles.  They always seem to be the most vocal against the people living in this city but really know nothing more than what they read online or see on WJZ.How can they form opinions without ever actually being involved?  What gets me the most is the whole personal responsibility thing. I was born and raised in this city with nothing at all so I know hard work and always wanting to be better is a huge part of success BUT without people social workers neighbors teachers etc. giving me help I would have NEVER broke the cycle.  When you are young whatever you are born into seems normal.  You are going to imitate the environment not knowing if its good or bad.  How can you expect people who have nothing and know no different to be successful model citizens?  Someone has to show them the alternative first.  If they still choose to take the wrong route then by all means they deserve the consequences.Long story short everyone wants these city residents to take care of themselves like all of a sudden this big bright light will go off and everyone will be successful  business owners or something.  In order for anything to ever change we will constantly need people in better environments to come in and show the young ones there are different routes to take....but sitting back and taking polls or calling everyone in the city a lost cause solves nothing.  ,baltimore,cxbdo3n,34,t5_2qipq

The American public shockingly isnt that progovernment after the government starts shedding blood. A good local example is when the government sent troops and bombers to kill laborers at the Battle of Blair Mountain. The laborers were utterly crushed  what else to expect when one side has planes dropping bombs and the other has no antiaircraft artillery  yet public opinion shifted so heavily against the government that many of the labor rights you enjoy today were enacted.Just be careful what you wish for Kent State may have seen protesters brutally crushed but no one exactly remembers the government fondly for what happened. gtThe states case was incredibly weak.On what grounds?

Even though Im not gonna vote for him Ill tell you about some of the good things. Martin OMalley is god awful at promoting himself Not sure how he won all those election here and has been a terrible debater so youre not really gonna hear the good things from him or his people...He got  mass rail transit lines basically funded and ready for formal plans and construction one for Baltimore and one for DC for the first time since the s that we we planned lay allnew track. Light Rail uses a lot of existing rail right of way. Simultaneously he started a massive investment in rural infrastructure.Guided Maryland through the recession fairly well and with a budget hovering around a surplus at the end of his term depending on your interpretation. Opponents accused him of pillaging and depleting the transportation fund but then the GOP got elected and now they claim theres TOO MUCH money in the transportation fund...Managed to pass gun legislation in a gun happy state obviously this is unpopular Theres been a mass of investment in Baltimore since the second half of his time as mayor. Under his governorship we became the first state to actually vote to legalize gay marriage. Negative aspects of his policing aside murder went way down during and shortly after his term as mayor. Personally I think there is a lot to be said for ucatnipfarmers explanation for why there were those negative aspects. ,baltimore,cy6hkhe,9,t5_2qipq

In fact the very same people who have fought to preserve these kinds of fond memorials to the Confederacy are usually the ones who pretend that the Confederacy was not really that bad.Though theres nothing about remembering history that necessitates having memorials at all your concerns would be better addressed by erecting new memorials to the victims of slavery in Baltimore and Union loyalists in the city.,baltimore,cyym8ft,8,t5_2qipq

I think instead there should be a new law that requires airsoftbb guns to clearly mark somehow that theyre not a real gun. As from a law enforcement perspective there practically is no way to tell the difference between a real gun and some airsoft guns these days from a decent distance. I am  for people being allowed to have airsoft guns to make it clear just they should not look exactly like a real version of which ever model they are. How should they go about making changes to differentiate them? I havent a clue. Just look at the difference between these two Kriss Vectors. The one on the top is airsoft the one on the bottom is real. Good luck figuring out the difference in a split second decision. ,baltimore,czw032s,1,t5_2qipq

6982003,0,t1_d17qjym,Lets examine the stupidity here. First and perhaps most importantly the vast majority of those cars you complain about are part of the commerce stream. The cars themselves the gas they use and the stuff they haul all are the end product of our interstate commerce. The people in them more often than not are going and coming to work or to go spend money somewhere.The roads are not full of cars that are just out burning gas for leisurely pleasure. Most people are using the roads to go somewhere to do something. Driving is a means to an end. By contrast bikers generally are out on the roads solely because they want to get some exercise and they dont care who they inconvenience.Now drivers do sometimes fuck things up for others. But there are these men and women driving cars with flashing lights perhaps youve seen them? If youre driving erratically or unsafely they will stop you and if they stop you enough they will take away your right to drive. And did you know one of the reasons they will stop you is for impeding the flow of traffic  meaning If you drive too slow on the road and youre not a farm vehicle they will give you a ticket. And thats because driving really slow on a road is unsafe. Cars coming around a curve or up a hill at  mph might not have time to stop before running up your backside because your in the middle of the road traveling at a leisurely  mph.  But yeah I guess your point is some drivers are assholes that create danger for themselves and others so bikers should be allowed to be dangerous assholes too.

7270454,0,t3_4exkqp,Auditing is fine and all but people need to come to grips that property taxes are high and service is low because roughly rd of the citys real property and around  of the assessed value is owned by nonprofits and doesnt contribute sufficiently contribute to the infrastructure of the city which it uses. Close to  million of revenue is lost each year from nonprofit properties being exempt. Whats even better is that this percent is constantly increasing as nonprofits buy or redevelop new land without helping to pay for it yet expect the same police presence the same sewer service and the same trash service as the people of Baltimore. The nonprofits bringing jobs to the city doesnt mean shit because.... of the citys revenue comes from property taxes just like nearly every city in America. Baltimore is in a unique position in which the borders have been locked in which compounds the problem by lessening development costs outside the borders for forprofits. Safeway has a smaller tax footprint outside the city because Baltimore County isnt being swallowed up by Hopkins for example.Until actual change happens the city is stuck in a positive feedback loop which allows for nonprofits to utilize city services without actually paying into it  they dump the costs of police sewer water etc onto the backs of the workers of the city. Just because they pat us on the head and tell us we brought you these jobs!! doesnt pay the salary of the cops in the city and it sure as fuck doesnt pay for the water main repairs.Unless Mike King has a plan other than to chase the audit dragon not fuck all will have changed.

7569169,0,t1_d32fjzv,Actually according to Illinois v. Wardlow running from a police officer gives them grounds to give chase and perform a pat down. Read the case its pretty much exactly the same facts except the guy had a gun not a knife.From the legal opinion Respondent Wardlow fled upon seeing police officers patrolling an area known for heavy narcotics trafficking. Two of the officers caught up with him stopped him and conducted a protective patdown search for weapons. Discovering a .caliber handgun the officers arrested Wardlow. We hold that the officers stop did not violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.The opinion goes on to explain that just being in a highcrime area does not give the police reason to stop you but But officers are not required to ignore the relevant characteristics of a location in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation.They go on to state that if an officer approaches a citizen without reasonable suspicion or probable cause it is within that citizens rights to ignore the officer. Quoting again But unprovoked flight is simply not a mere refusal to cooperate. Flight by its very nature is not going about ones business in fact it is just the opposite. Allowing officers confronted with such flight to stop the fugitive and investigate further is quite consistent with the individuals right to go about his business or to stay put and remain silent in the face of police questioning.The basic idea being if Freddie just stood there the cops would have had no authority to detainsearch him. But him running coupled with the fact that he was in a high crime area gives the cops reasonable suspicion and therefore the authority to chase and detain him.,baltimore,d32ksxb,3,t5_2qipq

That means that they can only employ so many people to loadunload.Second is the requirements for working at the port. These are labor jobs sure but theres also licensing and security checks that need to happen because theyre handling hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of merchandise and are able to facilitate criminal activity or possibly even terrorist activity. Good luck getting a job at the port with a criminal record. Third is just that the port was never the only employer supporting the growth of Baltimore. There were other blue collar jobs such as at the steel mill that just vanished and never came back. The families of those workers may not have left or even have had anywhere to go  the fact that the port is doing well doesnt mean it can provide enough employment to support the entire available labor pool.,baltimore,d3vs42c,1,t5_2qipq

Back when the rules and regs were way more looseygoosey in the s amp s and there was more manufacturing in the harbor Beth Steel on Sparrows Point among others lots of industrial waste turned the harbor and surrounding creeks into wastelands.  Our study was a long term monitoring project of those contaminant levels in the water column sediment and fish tissue.  Conclusion was that by the early s the PCB levels were within acceptable levels except in the sediment in a few hot spots which are designated EPA superfund sites.  Side effect of the study was the discovery of new contaminants namely fire retardants PBDEs that were actually increasing in fish tissue especially.  Our fish tissue samples were from catfish because of their proximity to and relationship with the sediments but crabs have that same relationship and bioaccumulate just as much.

I dont think any team in MLB had two starters knocked out by the second inning in a single week before. Fact check it if you want but thats not a record Id like to see the Orioles achieve  The riots obviously have a role. The first real flare up of violence during the unrest happened at Camden Yards and thats going to weigh on all sorts of people.   I wonder about the composition of the city itself.

Again if I manage to leave earlier it can end up being much faster. I used to live in the Pikesville area and just took Northern Parkway to I and it took about  mins morning and  evening. Although  sometimes got backed up read lane closures due to crashes in the evening and it could take much longer.I really like the Perry Hall area its pretty quiet and seems to be a nice neighborhood if youre down with surburbia. We have two dogs and our backyard is plenty big for them to run around and play fetch. Its also a nice neighborhood to go for walks. Let me know if you have any questions!Edit Ive only been here a few months but I have never had any issues with I being slow.

You could be taken in and waterboarded  for starts.  After all theres the promise to do a whole lot more than that by our Presidentelect. In the absence of surveillance criminals will feel free to pepper spray you rob you and knife you.   Id guess that thats at least as agonizing as waterboarding. Of course I see the Rolling Stone article is part of an ongoing process of vilification of Baltimore by the national media.  Its amazing.  Baltimore has been a reliably liberal bastion for years now yet the media love to characterize it as a stronghold for reactionary racists who keep poor blacks in urban dungeons and now a police state.Brilliant.  When we have a Presidentelect constantly yapping about the biased unfairness of the media the media lends credence to the complaints by slagging an urban area that has been so reliably liberal in basic orientation.

Realizing that I dont know much about the subject I decided to do some light research. Here are my takeaways links for citations whenever possible.  Theres a lot more information about Landlordfriendly states than there is about Tenantfriendly states due to all the realestateinvestment sources. Link  Link  Link    Maryland is as far as I found not in a single list of states where laws favor landlords.  Baltimore is more often than any city I could find in these articles explicitly singled out as an example of a tenantfriendly city. Link  Link   Maryland is according to realtor.com the most tenantfriendly state in terms of eviction. Link  As stated in a discussion started by a Landlord in the Baltimore Sun forum To say that Maryland is a tenantfriendly State would be the understatement of the year. Link  Nolo.com lists a summary of Rental Law by category for Maryland and everything is reasonably tenantfriendly at least.

11127265,0,t3_5ysh1w,Sourced fact not only does Baltimore have a high tax property tax rate it has an especially high tax burden when considering income car property and sales tax all together.  Anecdote having lived in Boston New York and Baltimore Baltimore far and away ranks as giving the least bang for my buck taxwise. It has the worst public transportation the worst basic infrastructure the leakiest and most severe violent crossneighborhood crime the most nuisance crime the worst air quality and far and away the most requests for jury duty of all three cities. It is also the least cosmopolitan city and comparatively lacks a serious connection to large global markets. Theyre trying but Im probably going to take my business to another city soon because small businesses in my tech sector require more global connections and simply cannot grow beyond a certain size in Baltimore. Im a something with a k house.On the other hand Ive lived inside the city for  years because living here has made my work commute less than  minutes. That has enabled many late nights and weekends which have been valuable. Additionally Baltimore has unsurprisingly the strongest small city feel of the three where bona fide local small businesses that dont only cater to the affluent can exist. It also seems to be under a state of constant change both positive and negative that gives the city an impression of being on the brink of explosive success or failure. That can be exciting or terrifying depending on how you look at it.In sum in my own selfinterest of course you should buy here! But if I were speaking to a friend my suggestion would be to avoid buying in Baltimore City unless you have an important practical reason to be inside city limits or unless you particularly like the feel of the place.

11728275,0,t3_67c4au,gtThe police department quite frankly has an almost impossible job he said. What can they do? Lock up more people? We need to situate them in a place where they can be a community agent and neighbor.As a start the SAs office could actually prosecute illegal gun possession cases and resist the urge to plea down violent crimes to short prison sentences.

11744379,0,t1_dgqfaam,I think something that is being overlooked here is that the NRA led compromise all the way through the s on gun control. However it became evident that the slippery slope was not a fallacy with gun control. Literally disbanding the nd amendment was the aims of many top government officials e.g. Senator Diane turn em all in Feinstein.  This brings up the point of compromise what compromise is there for an organization that knows it is fighting its antithesis? By compromising the NRA isnt ensuring that it will stop hearing calls for more legislation it is simply giving in. The NRAs end game is now to never compromise on anything major. Also  compromise isnt what gun control has ever been about. You dont have new laws coming out that give and take. Its all taking or all giving. Example Marylands Firearm Safety Act of  was  not compromise. It just took things away and added barriers to ownership. This is why the NRA has morphed Its very existence has been targeted as a result of a party plank. ,baltimore,dgr972f,11,t5_2qipq
