3444834,0,t3_2zogh2,I believe its stored in plain text in memory because it is needed in its original form to decrypt additional disks. I guess it could be stored in an encrypted form on the first hard disk but Im not sure where it would go.,VeraCrypt,cpkxpvy,1,t5_35kq6
6123014,0,t1_cyld6dn,Oh yeah absolutely. If its just encrypted volumes youre talking about full disk encryption gets a wee bit more complicated you can copy move and use your volumes on any machine you like even between Windows Mac and Linux platforms!,VeraCrypt,cylmfrk,2,t5_35kq6

9689432,0,t3_5dufdy,Are you referring to the bug that allows people to discover hidden volumes? I believe all volumes created prior to version .a are vulnerable.,VeraCrypt,da7fend,1,t5_35kq6

11044182,0,t3_5xmenk,The easiest and fastest way us via a container. Unless you absolutely need every single vile on your system to be encrypted The idea is that you crate a container and put what you want encrypted inside of it. That way not only can the container be portable but you no longer have to worry about any issues with your system being encrypted. Im sure you can read through this subreddit and see some of the issues that arise when you encrypt entire partitionsdrives etc. Not to say that you will run into those issues but the risk of running into an issue are higher if you dont go wit ha container.,VeraCrypt,deju7e7,3,t5_35kq6
