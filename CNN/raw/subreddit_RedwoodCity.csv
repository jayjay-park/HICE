4842490,0,t3_3ge204,Hi! Welcome! I am relatively new to the area as well and have found RWC to be a pretty social city. There are many weekly events where you can meet people especially if you enjoy music. Check out Stafford Park on Wednesday evenings and Music in the Square every Friday.As far as hiking goes there are so many great spots in the Bay area and North Bay. So far I have been though Pacificia Half Moon Bay Lands End for both hiking and biking. I plan on going up to North Bay to check out some waterfalls once we are passed the drought. On each of my hikingbiking trips I have come across a lot of people. I think that if you are proactive about getting out and doing then you will definitely meet folks!Also check out this website  to find events going on in SF and Bay area. I use it a lot when I am bored and I have yet to be disappointed.,RedwoodCity,cu4xle3,1,t5_2tobi
