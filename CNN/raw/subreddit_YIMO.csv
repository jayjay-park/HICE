Ive also been playing crit Yi only halted that for a brief moment when satedbotrktitanic hydra was OP and I can confirm you generally need to be good to do anything with it but the reward is massive.I had a few friends try it out and they couldnt pull it off. They could only pull off bruiser builds.However it may be a good idea to buy  defensive item as it can prevent burst allowing you to clean up fights.

It might have been there since he was released but probably no one was good enough to have noticed it back then. The bug as far as i understand is that there is a  server frame delay on when the untargetability state is applied like  milliseconds.gt gt This bug is extremely time consuming to fix.... To fix this well need to rewrite the entire ability and architect the spell logic correctly. This means that well need to retest everything with this ability. This is essentially  of the QA work needed to release a new champion and more since we need to ensure it looks sounds and feels just the same on all skins and Master Yi have a lot of skins. On top of that we need to verify a bug that exists for about  milliseconds which is really bloody time consuming.gt gt The fix I attempted went out to PBE in . and had  failure. Im currently in the tail of a project and do have no time to readdress the issues until it ships. Theres a lot of moving parts in Alpha Strike and I cant garentee the fix will be identical in feels to an experienced Master YI player your feedback will be appreciated when that rolls around.gt gt Cheersgt gt Exgeniar,YIMO,d8ewdlj,2,t5_3c24l
9206953,0,t3_56g7rj,I hit Gold yesterday with Silencees playstyle.   And of course every replay service decides to drop my last game. Oh well.   Looking at my recording again my first gank was at  minutes when I had ult and the enemy mid had no mana. I muted all at  minutes or so.  I went bot lane at  I already had B.F. Sword because I was counterjungling and farming until that and got a double kill since they were low CC.  After that point I was looking to counterjungle and countergank when I was near. Counterjungling when youre MUCH more ahead than the enemy jungle feels like straight up the most efficient way to set the enemy team behind.  At  minutes I had  farm and I was .

9239793,0,t1_d8n7679,OBJECTION!Take a look at Highlanders patch history here Cooldown increased to  from   Duration reduced to  seconds from  Onkillonassist duration extension increased to  seconds from You can clearly see that they increased it by s which is simply a nerf.Or are you talking about the fact that I said he is useless without his ultimate? That has honestly always been the case his potential is very limited without the steroids it gives.The only other time I mention nerfs is when I talk about the specific initial duration when you activate Highlander. As you say OVERALL it was just a change of the reset mechanic which makes Highlander buffed whenever he gets multiple kills.I personally wouldnt say that I prefer it it has some nice things to it like being able to zoom across the map after a team fight and take out an objective very fast but it also makes it so getting the initial reset is bit harder. As I mentioned in my post this hurts the dueling potential the most since in some cases like KhaZix your ult could run out before you even get a chance to do enough damage them which sucks.

10065863,0,t3_5jx3rf,Yeah lately a few Yi players have started playing him with either cinderhulktriforce or cinderhulkwits end. Idk about getting both as I usually try to get a titanic hydra fairly early.Now this build is good but the problem is that instead of getting a clear power spike right after finishing bloodrazor you have to finish both your damage item and your cinderhulk. So it basically takes more time for you to get relevant. Also another problem is that the build will fall off lategame. Tank items and hypercarries dont go well together. This build is strongest during mid game after  items. Also you still want to pick up fervor along with it and attack speed runes.As someone that has a lot of experience with Yi and has gotten a couple pentakills with cinderhulk Yi I can safely say that the build is good but you lack early game pressure you have to farm a lot and finish the game before  minutes or youll just fall off. Overall its a good build but most of the time bloodrazor is the better option.,YIMO,dbjlsnc,1,t5_3c24l

Later in the game if you didnt feed him or let him roam  hes likely to roam with his ult a lot once you have bork  I d build like this dunno how you do you can q on him once he activated his passive he will probably use his root then ult and use the bork as glabclosers before doing so be aware of the ennemy junglers position if ryze has flash and maybe ghost and that you dont you might not be able to outrun him.. well you should know about that last part.

Statikk Shivs description is very vague attacking generates Energize stacks. This is super vague and puts into question whether damaging abilities ought to stack it as well since they are attacks too.What I stated is how Shiv interacts with on hits and basic attacks.

I think cheesing low elo players in mid lane is also more intuitive than getting fed early as the jungler from what I remember when I was a noob. The removal of devourer on top of the season  jungle change also means that the optimal playstyle in the jungle is different since permafarming for sated while a playable strategy back then is completely impossible now.,YIMO,ddvc903,1,t5_3c24l
10851129,0,t1_ddz4brz,The other issue is that you have to do it leashless as the chance of a leash accidentally killing a small raptor is too high.  And if you lose one then the entire reasoning is lost.   And youve lost time as raptors take longer than buff wolves buff or such.,YIMO,ddz7tsr,1,t5_3c24l

10988785,0,t1_dedfy43,The active on youmuus is like the inverse of bork. Instead of slowing down the enemy you can speed up. The nice thing about Youmuus is that you can use it to escape a midlane gank and the build path is nice. The build path for BORK is shit compared to Youmuus. With youmuus you can buy  gold long swords if you are short for a full component which is VERY gold efficient. Youmuus is also  gold cheaper. I dont normally midlane with Yi but Youmuus should be perfectly fine. If you build Stattik Shiv right after you get a nice boost to attack speed and a ton of wave clear. You can also go with PD  Merc Treads of course for dueling power. Then you can go into IE and PD for  crit and a ton of damage. PDSS are really cheap crit items and should allow you to hard carry. Youmuus also as the added benefit of giving you flat lethality to start so it makes your already effective crit build even more effective against squishy targets. Edit You can also build into a GladeGleam Build if crit isnt your thing. Youmuus into Black Cleaver will give you  CDR and a good bit of burst and durability at  items. That is a pretty standard build path for a lot of mid assassins like talon. ,YIMO,dedjlce,1,t5_3c24l

11347001,0,t3_61x7xz,Im not a pro Master Yi player but I think I can give some general advice here.For runes whether or not you want to take AS or AD marks is up to you honestly people run both. AS might be better if youre planning to go a more onhit focused build that game while AD has higher initial burst. Just try both and see what you like more.For Seals most people take Armor for a healthier Jungle clear you can take scaling health too if you dont have any problems with that.Glyphs is probably where you have the most variety people run AS MR Scaling MR CDR and Scaling CDR. I recommend Scaling MR since they will pretty much always be useful and provide some lategame safety of getting one shot.For Quints its pretty much always AS.As for the builds theres no clear better build between Crit and OnHit although I find Crit a lot more effective against squishier teams while OnHit shreds tanks with ease. So Id decide what youre gonna build depending on the enemy team.Hope that helps!,YIMO,dfi5umj,5,t5_3c24l
11352892,0,t1_dfgpvlg,Im not sure why youd want Yi support when other can do better at the job.I dont know anything about the build but Id max E so I dont push the wave with Q too much. Use Q for gap close and try to hit as much wuju style as possible. If you fail then to hit them hard youll lose its valueable damage that is meant against single targets. You can use meditate to freeze wave too. But then again someone can do the exact same thing but better. ,YIMO,dfitv4u,1,t5_3c24l
