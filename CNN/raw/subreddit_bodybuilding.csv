Not whos physique do I like the best or who do I wish I looked like.Being a better bodybuilder is judged on specific criteria. Size symmetry proportion definition and and overall look.Ronnie is categorically bigger better proportioned equally symmetrical more defined and here is the subjective part ties all this together better than Arnold. This sport is about developing your musculature to the best it can be.

It made it where I feel it on every lift and even setting up weights. You can get a sleeve which will primarily keep it warm a tennis elbow band thAt puts pressure on the injury get a cortisone show to alleviate the inflammation or take a break and let it heal before it becomes a real problem.

I have bought sold and test over multiple jugs of protein over the previous  years and I have yet to come across ONE that is EXACTLY as label claims. Honestly there is no way to be  perfect to label claims due to various machinery used to produce the product. Also unknown to many MANY of these companies and smaller underground companies use the same major manufacturers to create their protein so it is no wonder why cross contamination happens.

239729,0,t1_cf5l86e,Youve seen some people getting fat not a shock.  I see just as many people get fat doing any split where they eat stupid.  Im not rambling about anything simply laying out the facts.  Beginners grow fatest focusing on getting strong as hell and traditional powerlifting as a base does this best most of the time.  It isnt a coincidence all of us guys who fucking hate PL training still recommend those programs and its done over and over from Coleman himself recommending it to Arnold to most lifters who got anywhere. Success leaves clues.As for pics sorry I cant help you there never really took them until I started training for shows.  Is  pounds something ridiculous?  I mean to be fair my working sets are taken to much much deeper levels of failure than probably anyone youve met.  Not bragging its just a style of training that many dont follow.  Is there a reason you just assume Im lying?  Should I assume youre lying?  Youre not going to convince anyone something thats true isnt true.  My history is very clear. Former fatty.  Cut a bunch of weight with cardio but still looked sot despite some lifting.  Ditched the bodypart split to focus on strength only for  months suddenly got better gains.  Went back to a bodypart split first using . times a week then x a week.  x a week worked better.  Got up to a very soft  cut down to a shredded .  Been reasonably cut as high as  and continuously putting on strength relative to my size.  Nothing incredible but every year i put on about  quality pounds between shows.  what is so shocking about any of this?  this is basic.  Dont sweat the small stuff.  Lift heavier weights.  But if youre benching  pounds when you start its hilarious to be doing inclines flies and crossovers when your bench is that weak.  You gain more muscle putting more weight up at first.  I actually posted a video of mine on here a while back but deleted it later due to my name being on it.  My next show Ill keep the name off and might post it.  Side note if you look through my post history youll see before my first show when i was at about  I started to use some gear.  Feel free to think thats how I can train this way and still gain but im a low dose guy and train natties with the same system.  Never seen a problem with it.  Not sure whats got you so upset about all this.  ,bodybuilding,cf5ll1t,1,t5_2ql8s

384287,0,t1_cfkhcd0,Yeah thats not the issue.  Your comment was misleading so i called you out. Im not nearly as experienced as you and neither am i competitive bodybuilder but I understand carb manipulation. However high protein high fat low carb is great for a cut.  You probably already know that but when i first read your comment i thought you were responding to DAREs question as well. Im just covering my basesK now with regards to bulking....this is just based on my own research i cant claim to speak from personal experience.  But its my understanding in determining how much carbs you need to gain mass it depends on insulin sensitivity and training volume.  So of course if youre doing a traditional bodybuilding split i can see how it would make sense to consume more carbs.  Even so though it might not be as much as you think.  It could be as few as glb of body weight.Just because its not in line with traditional bodybuilding nutrition doesnt mean a relatively low carb bulk cant be done.  I mean if were talking below g a day i feel ya but i dont believe that is what were talking about.  I think in the future lower carb bodybuilders will be more commonMario Singelmann is an example of one.  Paleo bodybuilder.  ,bodybuilding,cfklhj8,1,t5_2ql8s

396378,0,t3_1yhmof,Herniated my ll disc about a year and a half ago from deadlifting. Assuming your injury is like mine posterior herniation you will benefit from never fucking rounding your back. If I sit in a chair for more than  min even now I get the dull fucking ache and it sucks. So from now on you need to always sit with perfect posture. I even duct taped a little hand towel and put it behind my lower back when I sit. That helps a lot. Aside from that keep your hamstrings hip flexors and calves really loose. If they get tight they can further pull your shit out of alignment. Before my injury I wasnt very flexible. After going to PT like a beast Im medium flexible but stretch everyday dont round your back when you stretch hamstrings I lay on my back and get a belt and put my leg up in the air and stretch it. Finally you need to build up the muscles in your lower back and lower abs. If these muscles are strong as fuck youll basically have a muscle back brace. I am finally able to squat   times and rack pull . Im still way weaker but getting better every day albeit slow as fuck. what Im currently doing stretch everyday hamstrings hip flexors calvesx a week abs emphasis on lower absx a week lower back initially only hyperextensions with no weight now Im working up to heavier rack pullsHang in there and dont punch too many babies,bodybuilding,cflumsg,1,t5_2ql8s

The only problem you might have is if you have very low hanging lats but again that would only be a problem if you really bulked up quite a bit.

Id say shoot for  calorie surplusday.I was always the chubby kid growing up and it allowed me to easily put on muscle when I tried but with the muscle came a lot more fat than I would consider ideal.I did have friends who were in your shoes guys who seemingly couldnt gain weight no matter how hard they tried. One advantage they always had was that they had a lot more leniency in their diet and the weight they did gain was usually high quality lean muscle mass as long as their diet was not complete shit.So Id say focus on bulking just dont go too crazy with the calories and make sure you are lifting hard so your body utilizes those calories to build muscle.

In fact if you run before you lift you actually will not be about to bulk up as much had you not run because of the reduced amount of glycogen youll have starting your set.

I would cut and continue lifting heavy would it be me in your place right now.  Nothing extreme but maybe to  body fat.  You can still gain strength this way high weightlow reps for compound lifts and more volume on auxiliary lifts you just shouldnt count on any lean mass gain.

591300,0,t1_cg7h3ry,No I mean bipolar disorder. And yes I know its manicdepressive. I was initially diagnosed with just depression and anxiety but later with bipolar according to that psychiatrist it was because it can only be diagnosed properly during a manic episode. Im not raging  I have mood swings. However the frequency varies. My overall mood can vary day to day week to week or month to month. This runs the gamut from relatively happy but often manic which means insomnia among other things to generally lethargic to almost suicidal depression I have been suicidal before and was held against my will at the hospital overnight at one point to extreme irrational rage. This week happens to be a pretty angry week though Ive had my swings of extreme depression as well. Last week was good. Of course I also have smaller mood swings within that larger general arc. So it might be a happy month but Ill have moments where Im really down or really angry or even really sad as in emotionally distraught which I consider different from being depressed.Another problem I have is that I tend to selfmedicate with alcohol and when Im manic that shit doesnt hit me like it normally does so I sometimes wind up downing a whole bottle of vodka in one night in an attempt to wind down but it doesnt work. Pots better but not as good as real medication obviously.As for real meds Im trying to get on some. The problem is I dont make a lot of money and Im in that sweet spot where Im not poor enough for government assistance but also dont make enough money to pay for good health insurance or outofpocket visits to a psychiatrist which is what I need to get bipolar medication. I have a friend who is going to pay for me so Im going in a week or two but the last several years of my life have been hell.This is one of the reasons I work out actually. Excercise helps my mood. For one thing it reduces the number of depressive episodes as well as their length. Unfortunately due to my lack of control of my mood motivation sometimes becomes a bitch.I guess I shouldnt expressed myself in such a simple manner in my initial post. I incorrectly assumed that reddits douchebag pedantic fucking aspergerhaving shitcocks werent a part of this sub not you so much as some of the other assholes who are all apparently fucking experts on psychiatry and somehow know me personally and intimately and can therefore accurately judge my exact situation fucking twats.tldr Yes I know its manicdepressive and Im struggling with exactly that.,bodybuilding,cg7hgeo,1,t5_2ql8s

635906,0,t1_cgcjgyo,Insoluble doesnt break down and so need not be counted.  Soluble can break down in the large intestine and if memory serves a . calories per gram figure being thrown about in the past.  So yes soluble fiber does have some caloric value without raising blood sugar or other carbrelated activities.  Found where I saw that . number. Some people consider fiber caloriefree assuming that it just provides bulk to the diet but what many people dont realize is that bacteria in your gut feed on some types of fiber. They chow down on your dietary bulk and it results in the production of shortchain fatty acids which your body can use. So from that point of view fiber would count as calories.However not all the fiber that you eat meets this fate and theres no clear consensus on fibers caloric contribution. On one hand the FDA estimates the amount of caloric contribution due to bacterial degradation at about . calories per gram of fiber. However different countries and institutions have divergent ideas of what fiber is let alone how to calculate it in any given meal. The FDAs estimate is just that an estimate. From here  In any case I dont count them.Good luck!,bodybuilding,cgcjww8,3,t5_2ql8s

Arnold was an international celebrity. I knew about Rich Froning even though I couldnt possibly care less about crossfit. On the other hand I had no idea who the fuck Ronnie Coleman Phil Heath Kai Greene or Jay Cutler were until I started reading this sub.Bodybuilding used to be about health fitness and balanced physiques. It created athletes that average people could admire and aspire to be like. Now its just a bunch of desperate supplement pushers seeing how bloated they can get without dying. No one outside your little circlejerk has any respect for them and no one in the industry gives a shit about the health of the bodybuilders as long as they dont die on stage.

I think it says you can do multiple singles or even perform that RM to failure if you can complete more than one rep. is based on percentages of your RM for each lift. I put RM in  because it doesnt have to be your actual RM many people use projected RM or even purposely lighter RM in order to make the transition into the program more easily. After all most people will complete multiple cycles of  and by their fifth or sixth cycle they should be well over their starting RM.,bodybuilding,cgujggd,1,t5_2ql8s

If I go out I usually get whatever is the most calorie dense no matter what it is... I figure that may old intake was around  a day and thats a bit conservative. Its been a while since ive actually tracked calories but Im certainly no stranger to it so I have a rough idea. Dense foods have just been making me sick now.

859127,0,t1_ch19mnm,I prefer a box but a sock should do the trick.  All joking aside can gear make you sterile?  Id imagine you would have to be genetically predisposed but that would suck if one wants kids. Also commenting this here because it will get buried otherwise The things keeping me  from gearing up is the ambiguity of information on the internet school and jobs that drug test.  That being said I would likely run a light PH cycle first before dabbling in anything else.  I have a good idea of how I would run that cycle but what pisses me off is when people ask for information on cycles i.e. what dosage to take where to find AIs etc.  of the responses are people saying Oh if you dont already know that youre not ready.  Well how the fuck are they supposed to know when thats the only response people get when theyre trying to educate themselves?  That contributes to the younger guys improperly cycling and in some cases acquiring the bad sides.Another thing that pisses me off is all the scare tactics people post in response.  People saying Youre dick will forever be flacid youll ruin your endocrine system your balls will stay shrunk etc. etc...Sure these sides are real possibilities especially with heavier and methylated PHs but based on what I have seen over  years of researching significantly fewer actual cases of the bad shit happen than everyone exaggerates.  I highly doubt a mild PH like halo would wreck every single person under s body.  So why keep the information of how to properly cycle from people who are already going to do it anyways?  Im not saying we should condone use at that age whatsoever but at least inform them and present the possible cons of hormone use instead of censoring.

I dont think so it takes all that plus competing and having a physique that is lean and thick. To me its like calling yourself a basketball player and you arent in college or the nba.

My solution was communication Let the poor man know that if youve spent a good portion of your workout there and people start pressing the dude in the only other rack next to you wondering when it is available perhaps it is time to finish up your sets and be creative with the free weights or the machines. Of course I put this in a proper manner no need to get aggressive.In your case though it sounds like he cant really be reasoned with. And even if it contradicts what I just said fight fire with fire.

1359517,0,t3_29n9bx,Alrighty. First of all fit chan correct? Or did you mean rfitness? fit has some genius but you have to sift. Either way I suggest you learn via Google the fundamentals of gaining muscle losing weight bodybuilding nutrition and bodybuilding routines. Read as much as you can here as read posts and comments.Heres some insight. Your first routine is a classic bb split in my opinion completely underwhelming until you reach a level you wont without steroids. Working out each muscle group only once a week will not be as effective for you as working them two some three or more times a week. General rule of thumb  ChestBackLegs twice a week but lift heavy and hard each time. Arms I would only isolate three times a week due to compound lift exhaustion. Abs every other day. Shoulders  depending on your recovery and how heavy you choose to lift. Think the bigger the muscle the longer it takes to repairYour second routine has too many compound lifts stacked on top of each other assuming day  was in a row and too few of total exercises. Look up a Push Pull Legs routine. I do PPL MS in the morning with HIIT ED and abs EOD. Its tried and true and can take you from beginner to advanced in no time. ,bodybuilding,cimpepd,1,t5_2ql8s

Even if  lbs of that  was water weight you were probably at around  calories or so and that can screw your stamina hard. Especially if you went from a bulk to a cut like many BBers do you are used to  calories and now your at  you are going to feel different. In fact the change in diet the bodybuilding cutting diet is not buttfriendly and neither is keto at least when you are acclimating might account more for your poop issues. Youre cutting out a lot of fiber most likely from cutting out complex carbs like you said in a comment.

1841759,0,t1_ckb0xz0,Your muscles need something called ATP to work and you have a limited supply in a given part of your body. So as you deplete ATP your body needs to produce more. This can be done in  ways one of which uses creatine phosphate. Supplementing with creatine means more creatine phosphate and a greater capacity to produce ATP. But this system is most effectiveoperational for only about  seconds before the lactic acid system takes over so if youre not really training for strength or power the benefits of supplementation are arguably negligible.Im no expert just studying a fitness course so more than happy to be corrected.,bodybuilding,ckb4mzg,9,t5_2ql8s

1909979,0,t3_2gi51n,You are fine. The type of test an employer does is concerned with recreational drugs. These tests will test for Pot benzos amphetamines methamphetamines opiates mdma barbituates and I am blanking on the last few but you get the idea. Any drug test beyond these is done for a specific drug and these are very expensive. Once again these would be done for certain recreational drugs that dont show up on a normal screen like I talked about above. Examples would be dextromethorphan diphenhydramine spice or bath salts. Steroid tests are their own test and there are several ways to do it. They are very expensive and no employer would ever do one without specific reason to. I used to work at a drug treatment center and did a ton of drug testing. We had several clients who I knew were on the sauce but were never tested for them several crappy reasons for this. They never had any issues with false positives which is not surprising because there was no reason for it. There are somethings that can cause falsepositives such as sorbital on an eeg and steroids and cycle related drugs do not. You are fine. ,bodybuilding,ckjc9cr,3,t5_2ql8s

Heres a link to the basic layout of the program Heres what the workouts look likeHeres the daybyday plan for meI like supplements on a cutMy goal is to reach  bf so I can get back into bulking. I expect to accomplish that in  weeks at lbs.When I bulk again it be for  months weeks aiming for  pound per week for a total of lbs. So I will weigh at least  around July  at which point I will cut again. Also Im going to run this cut and the subsequent bulk with the assistance of mg of bromocriptine every morning. Lyle McDonald wrote a booklet of that subject as well. Its supposed to balance your hormonal response to calorie deficits and surpluses. When I bulk I eat the same foods as when I cut just a much greater amount of carbs and I bulk at around  calories per day.

2332484,0,t1_clzyavw,Haha exactly! Its like imagine being the life of the party is being the sun. You have to constantly radiate warmth and positively and people are feeding off the energy youre putting out. An extrovert can draw this energy just from being around others and being in a new surrounding. Its like a Solar Beam from DragonBall z. Feeding off all this energy to make your own internalize itand then to radiate it. Whereas being an introvert is like being a cell phone. You gain energy from just relaxing and being left alone to recharge. You can then use this energy to radiate out to others and be the life of the party.So yeah! Im super fun at parties but only because I spent  hours in bed on reddit today doing nothing. Im recharged. Dealing with me when Im low energy just isnt possible.

Stop holding on to the pipe dream that drugs will make you an amazing bodybuilder. Many people around Ronnie like Brian dobson always talk about how he could put on muscle at an insane rate without even a proper diet. Heck look at his videos what he ate pre contest. They did a test on him at last years olympia iirc and they found out he had a gene that makes it near impossible for him to get fat. Also he has a gene that allows him amazing recovery times which is why he was able to train like he did and so frequently. Wait isnt that why people take drugs in the first place??

2359845,0,t3_2m3nrx,For a natural recreational lifter who wants to look good why you are in rbodybuilding right? I really recommend avoiding the bulking and cutting advocated online. If you do it I would start your bulk quite lean even if you are skinny and dont gain weight to the point youd be ashamed of your gut if you went swimming. Why spend hours working out if youre afraid to take your shirt off for half the year or more? Competing bodybuilders have different goals and major bulks may help them if they are only competing once a year but you want to look good yearround dont you?I think your fear of fat is healthier than dreamer bulk drive so Id listen to it.

It was a result of pinching a nerve from putting too much strain on my neck from pressing exercise shoulders incline bench etc.While its almost completely gone now it took me a month  of physio to alleviate the tightness that had  accumulated in my neck area and the reason why it was at its worst in the morning is because apparently youre discs inflame during sleep which would cause my pinched nerve to be aggravated and most noticeable when i first wake up.

For some reason powerlifters and strength training advocates like to push the nonsensical argument that people who train for hypertrophy dont utilize progressive overload.As if someone who trains for size is going to keep their lifts at the same weight for weeks and months at a time because theyre afraid to go heavier or increase the weight.It really baffles me when people make the argument you cant get bigger if you dont get stronger.

I have had to drop the weights down a lot about the same as i use with  hand on DBs. Last night on my workout i noticed i was a lot more stable and was able to throw on some heavier weights.Just make sure your shoulders and everything else is in the right place for the lift. A small tip that helped me activate the pecs more in bench was Trying to break the bar in half with my hands  squeezing the bar really hard. ,bodybuilding,cmypr0q,3,t5_2ql8s

2645834,0,t3_2q5y99,Ok so Ive mentioned this before. Ive done quite a bit of research and am having some trouble figuring this out. Figured Id ask one last time just before I take a week off. Ive been having some pain during chest exercises and a few tricep exercises mainly tricep pushdownstraight bar and rope occurring in whatever ligamentjointtendon??? connects the anterior deltoid to the tricep muscle on the left side of my left arm. This same location on my right arm occasionally flares up but not as often and with much less pain. Most of my exercises are on the lighter side of things too.  lb dumbbell one arm bench rows being the heaviest thing I do short of  lbs on bench lbs squat. When I do assisted pullups it also flares up a little as well even using the best back connection possible during the lift.   lbs  BF. Been lifting  months and this pain has been around for about  weeks. The only thing that I can figure is its tricep tendonitis maybe? Most tendonitis describes pain near the elbow and mine is right below the deltoid. This pain flares the most during flat dumbbell chest flies and using the pecdec machine. Id say my form is pretty good and I only use  lb per arm on that exercise in particular. Im happy to draw a circle on a picture of an arm diagram to pinpoint it better. It could simply between a strained tricep head. I really dont know for sure. Im taking a week off and going from there.

This is why I was talking about the need for blood pressure meds.This is not even debatable look at Ronnie Colemans supplement stack hes on more heart meds then gear. Still dont believe how dangerous these drugs can be? Listen to this former ifbb pro talk about his advice for young competitors  nearly had kidney failure. Guess what its control your BP so you dont have kidney failure.Dave palumbo talks about it in the above podcast I linked too. These are veteran body builders reminding you to get bloods and monitor your BP if you decide to take gear.If you decide to just stay away from advanced drugs like hgh and insulin makes you safe think again. Because teste and dBol cause excess water retention which causes high blood pressure!! Most of the time even with a proper AI BP will go up.BP meds be prepared to go on them if your in this for the long haul.

I will admit I dont per say understand the difficulties of what its like to be manic what it feels like but only see how it effects my girlfriend.. I would never wish it on anyone.. I have seen what it can do. I just also do not find it is an excuse to treat others poorly as I stated. I can understand how if he does not have anyone for support and to keep him on top of things such as medication it can become more complex. I may be looking at it a little too harshly and know its not easy. Just from my perspective and Im sure many others even people with bipolar would not want someone to say that hes treating people bad cause of it. It kind of gives the disease a bad name.. If you know what Im saying. I know I would be furious if people started believing that poor behaviour in how they treat people is linked to manic depression.

Oats and eggs are great for breakfast and both sale price tuna . and bulk greek yougurt  servings . deliver over g protein for less than  and are excellent for betweenmeal snack choices.Try to stock up on frozen veggies Birdseye or store brand when they are on sale so be sure to check your fliers. Fresh is fine too just be sure to cook them sooner and turn them into left overs which if you have a ton of you should also freeze some for later in the week or when you are pushing off a trip to the store till next check. Really think about how much money you spend eating out if you do and think of how many more calories and subsequent growth you could purchase at the grocery store instead. Sure chipotle is delicious and sometimes you gotta chipotle but when I stop and think about it Id rather have burritosized biceps than an actual burrito.Echoing some of the other thoughts here the best  you could spend would be at the spice rack. Get yourself Cajun Adobo Italian and Cayanne and detonate that flavor bomb.

Cover the pan in foil. I crimp the top piece of foil to the bottom so its an airtight seal.   . Cook in  degree oven for  hour.

Since I started bbing I always hoped to run into her cause shes essentially why Im here and I wanted to rub my six pack in her face. Well apparently she and her new bf are supposedly perfect and her friend thinks they might get married or some shit. Her friend asked if I was in the frat and I jokingly said that I was only there for the free beer cause you know poor college student and shit. Well that only made things worse because back when we were dating I had money. Now not so much. Also dat bulking feel. I dont even have abs anymore.

I think the reason they are in the . mg caps is because you arent supposed to go straight to the full dose mg in your case. It is generally recommended to start at  pill and work your way up to the full dose slowly if you arent having adverse effects.Also I believe yohimbine doesnt work if you eat food around it because of insulin release according to a few studies.

3089601,0,t1_coi5m6g, Legs need work with posing. Obviously hard to judge if youre even flexing them with those shorts on. Think of your body like an hourglass when youre posing and not a martini. Also a classic tip pose your legs first then hit the upper. Side tricep  bring the back shoulder around more it will bring more attention to your core and chest while also creating the illusion of a more dramatic waist to shoulder ration. Also use your back leg to push your front legs hamstring forward and put all your weight on the front leg to create more lines in the quad. Most muscular  hands are meeting too low and thus forcing your arms to be too close to your body this removes the opportunity to display any latserratus definition you might have. Front bi  legs need to be open more and bowed out to create a quad sweep. Natties especially need to emphasize leg posing because mass will never be enough to get attention. Also bend wrists more so your forearms show more definition. Finally kick hips back to again create the illusion of a smaller waist since it will be marginally further from the judges this will also create more lines near your pelvis. Absnthighs  youre doing more of a vacuum pose something not important at all for judging its a novelty pose. You need to create crunch down on your abs so the judges can see all your oblique ab serratus lines. Similar leg posing to front double bi put one leg slightly forward and open up more.,bodybuilding,coi8hku,1,t5_2ql8s

We had been dating for  years and she was the only person I would spend time with. Ditched all my friends and hobbies which is what eventually caused her to no longer be interested.Im  now and married. Honestly if I could give my  year old self advice at that time it would be to keep myself busy and focus on something I enjoyed even though it is hard to look at things from the outside when someone no longer is interested in you.

3227990,0,t3_2x1lvl,I dont know about you but for me part of the journey is figuring shit out on my own. I take pride in knowing what type of training foods rest etc work for me and the only way to figure that out is trial and error. When I first started training I went from a lbs fat fuck to lbs and ripped. I didnt google search how to lose fat fast or best cutting stack or best diet. I got my fat ass on a treadmill or a bike or out to the track and ran. I lost all that fat without anybodys help I did it on my own. Then I started lifting. I went to the gym and started doing the basics. Now looking back I did shit wrong and not optimal for gains but you know what I learned and grew from it as a lifter. I learned how I respond to different types of training or what works best or how to eat. Now when I have built myself a solid foundation of personal knowledge I started reading this and that forming my own opinion. Having my own knowledge before going to a place where people are throwing various ideas at you helps you understand what is good info and what is shit. Its not about people being assholes and not wanting to help beginners it is people wanting to run before they can walk. People come on here so concerned about which shitty preworkout they should take or if their protein intake is optimal or all this other dumb shit about what happens if I miss a day. For fucks sake figure some shit out on your own. That is part of the journey and part of what it takes to make you a better bodybuilder. When they say everybody is different they dont mean that everybody is literally different because most people will be able to be successful with the same shit they mean that every has a different journey and if you just go along with other peoples ideas the entire time you are losing the point of it. Its like a mind muscle connection you dont learn that from a sub on reddit you develop it from time under the bar.,bodybuilding,cowl3jm,6,t5_2ql8s

3339952,0,t3_2yewqi,So I just started less than a month ago. I work at the place with the best contract in my country Norway. The qualifications we needed were of the highest. You either had to have it from the the Norwegian sports academy or the academy of personal training. Both of which cost about k us dollars. My contract is kinda unique I do work for a gym but Im also an independent at the gym. We do where uniforms from them but we just rent the gym. They dont take any percentages but you have a  dollar flat rent per month. Since our gym doesnt have any staff we also have a couple of other work tasks. Like we have to do weekend checks to make sure nothing is broken we got  different hours a week where we introduce the new members to the gym and the concept and give them their login chip. We have different price levels based on education and experience. It differs from  dollars to . We can kinda charge what we want but the gym doesnt want us to differ too much from these prices. Like Im allowed to take  of students if I want to but of course it comes out of my paycheck. I dont do online coaching but I have friends from the study I took that does. I kinda dont believe in it. Like if you live in a very rural area I can understand the need. But otherwise a PT is just fine. If you are gonna prep for a show I would recommend someone like John Otis Hollywood. That I can understand the online need for but otherwise I dont see the point. Programs I just write myself. They teach us the principles at school and then you just write the techniques in the way it fits your clients goal etc. The easy part of the job is the training. The hard part is getting clients. Ive reached out to every single one I know of friends family friends of friends. Spreading the word giving out as many free samples as I can. And sooo few canwant to continue. And I live in one of the richest countries in the world mind you. The pay for me is  dollars an hour. I do however tax about . I have to work  hours  weeks a year to earn the average income in Norway. The reason for  weeks is because this is a seasonal job. People dont train during summer and also not right before christmas. However january are high for sales. I can write more later. Gotta go to work. Sorry if my English is bad. Just ask if you want me to explain something better. Okey makin an edit here. Not that good at Reddit but hopefully it will be OK. Wrote a bit wrong at top I think Norwegian University of sports science is a more appropriate translation not academy. Ive been lifting for  years myself now. My squat and deadlift are a bit week due to years of accutane use which made my back ache a lot so those lift were hard to do. But Im pulling about  lbs kg in DL and  x  in squat. Benched  lbs  kg yesterday. The potential for me to make money in this job is great. But its a very big risk and big reward kind of job. The reason I mainly wanted the job is because I had a personal trainer in my first few years of training myself when I was . So my main goalpassion is to help young kids get in the shape they want because this generation is getting a huge amount of self esteem issues due to all the perfection they get from instagram and facebook etc. And I dont think you can change that body image pressure so instead I want to help them reach their goals in the best and safest way possible. Because when I hear  year olds say they dont look good enough or fit enough and are ashamed etc it just breaks my heart. Because everyone in this sub probably knows how terrible that can feel.  But what Ive realized so far is selling to this group is damn hard. But its my passion so Ill do my best. Money is not a huge priority for me right now anyways. I just want to do shit and I get so happy when I see others progress. So for me its worth it. However if you consider this job just remember you will get a lot of no. You will get denied a lot. You will feel like everything is going great with a potential costumer and then they just cant continue. This is a lot harder than you can imagine. This is not a job you should get if your main goal is to get rich. This is not a job you should get if you just love to train. This is a job for someone who genuinely cares about other people and their selfesteem and health even tho a lot of them will deny you. Here is my besthardest example so far. When I started I offered to train everyone Ive ever known just to make my face out there in the gym making people see that I work there and train people. One of them was a girl I was friends with at middle school. I asked her and she said she couldnt bother with exercise. Then a few weeks later her father goes into a pretty serious heart attack. She then comes crawling at me begging me for help and for me to train her. I say of course and set up and appointment. Then it begins. Oh Im sick this week Im sorry Oh Im too busy this week I need to spend time with my father just give me time. Had an argument with my boyfriend Im too sad to workout. And so on and so on till the point where I just gave up. And stuff like that will happen where I took time out of many days waited for her planned how to help her and reach her goals and then she didnt show up. In the end the communication just stopped. And its hard because I really want to help. I have to realize that its not my fault but in this jobworld its so fucking easy to feel like it has something to do with you and that you suck. ,bodybuilding,cp8z9e2,18,t5_2ql8s

3373391,0,t1_cpcmg8p,We dwell on it for multiple reasons. First of all GETTING fat was a blast for me. Parties ladies mountains of buffalo wild wings. It was glorious. Its the negativity associated with when you snap and realize that wow Ive become a fat piece of shit I need to get my health and lift together. That sticks in my mind. The first couple months are the hardest because it feels like no matter how hard you go no matter how perfect your diet is that there is virtually no progress because you have so far to go.Now personally Im in a full body transformation right now. Ive dropped  pounds since the th of december put on about  pounds of muscle all while cutting. But I still have  pounds to go and I know these are going to be a lot harder to lose than the first . Its been years since Ive been skinny and I know its not just going to show up overnight. I dwell on the fact that no matter how hard I bust my ass tonight at the gym Its still going to be  months MINIMUM before i start even seeing the light to my goal. Knowing that I am putting so many things on pause so I can get my body straight is infuriating because if I just would have made the time in the past I would be much happier with myself.Ive never been sub  body fat in my adult life.

Before  its almost impossible because even if anyone knew it could build bigger muscles they wouldnt have been able to obtain a source of it.Testosterone suspension and the esters were developed in the s and s in academic environments by researchers working with it. Testosterone itself wasnt produced by any major lab in the U.S. for distribution until its FDA approval in . So it was around but not available ...plus it wasnt until the early s that anyone realized it could be used for athletic purposes i.e. to build abovenormal strength and muscle in healthy young individuals.For the record Reeves won most of his titles in  and before.

Its up to you. Ive asked a lot of bodybuildersphysique competitors what they squatbenchdeadlift and the first response is Well I dont really know my max since I do things for reps when my question was really kind of vague and given their goals i wanted to know what they did in training.Anyway the point is its up to you.,bodybuilding,cq2iy80,5,t5_2ql8s

To succeed in one place you need to fail in another. There is nothing wrong with you prioritizing your goals and self over your relationship with her. That lends itself to the possibility of the relationship failing. But that is your choice as it is also hers to walk away.I am going through the exact same thing right now. Focus on myself the gym and business and we will fit the relationship where we can.

3648360,0,t1_cq7tupv,Sure thing  the first thing to note is that a test for statistical significance takes sample size into account. So for the results that are statistically significant it already calculates that it is unlikely to be because of a random difference between the two groups. So for the results that show significance a larger sample size probably wont really buy you anything  the significant results will still be significant. It might get you a more representative sample of the full population  but I dont see any large concerns with sampling bias for this study. You simply have to note that it might not extrapolate to those populations that werent studied e.g. elderly women different training protocols etc etc.More power may however turn some of the trends into significant results e.g. the difference in RM bench press might turn out significant if you look at more people. That is interesting and one endpoint I might like to see more people studied for.It may even turn some of the similar results into significant differences. But then you have to ask whether the result is clinically meaningful as we would say in the medical field. For instance if you studied  people maybe you could elucidate that the quad circumference measure of . vs . would be statistically significant but who the fuck cares? Its .. Similar to a study that shows a statistically significant difference in surgical operation time of  minutes for a multiple hour procedure. Yeah its a statistical result but no one cares. So overall you have to look at what the study shows what bias exists and if it matters what more power would get you and make your conclusions as to whether the sample size was adequate. Here I think a larger sample might be interesting for a couple endpoints but they have  a lot of endpoints and interesting data overall and I dont think sample size is a real limitation of this study. ,bodybuilding,cq85237,9,t5_2ql8s

3668573,0,t1_cqaffid,t is human thyroid hormone. Its not an AAS but is effectively similar to replacing your test levels with injections except instead of developing muscle itll speed your metabolism up. It is NOT kind on muscles though. If you arent on gear be very careful above  mg I think thats the units. We as humans generate this much naturally. Doubling the dose will cause your body to double the amount of calories it needs. This is a huge issue because itll take it from wherever is easiest aka muscles for people with a large amount of musculature. Im not talking about taking large doses just a replacement to ensure it doesnt drop which it will.rfl is just referencing lyles rapid fat loss diet.I found that eventually I was going to plateau anyways refeed or not. t prevented that plateau but the fat refeed is still necessary for both hormones and sanity. Also found that huge deficit cuts go to hell after you put on some muscle and are in the ballpark of lean. You can drop a lot of fat very fast if you dont have any muscle to hold on to.

I decided to take it on myself between blood work to get an idea of what my limitations were within  months my family doctor called to let me know my AC had returned to normal levels. Not long after that I started reducing my insulin intake because of repeated lows. Ive read about a few people who had TD and were into bodybuilding and they had managed in some cases to reduce their insulin intake to almost nothing.

3745717,0,t1_cqj62vv,Sorry. Im going to say no. Any idiot with half a brain will see that I constantly redirect their accusationsquestions and just assume im on gear. Saying no is a lie but atleast it allows them to speculate rather than just assume. Everyone should say no. Deny deny deny until you are proven otherwise. Even then deny. Steroids are illegal. Im not here to fight that or discuss how stupid it is. This is the law. Anytime someone assumes im on gear and then passes word around is a risk to me and my career. Even if the risk is small im still going to do damage control. As far as anyone knows im fuckin natty. Dont like it? Fuck yourself. Of course in not going to tag every fucking IG pic i put up as natty and offer prep services. That is just douchey. But there is absolutely nothing wrong with people responding to gear accusations and speculation with a simple no. If you think otherwise you take the ethics of the sport more serious than you do the law and that is stupid. My best advice for gear users in regards to protecting themselves? Deny everything. Dont tell anybody. Never transport gear yourself. Maintain complete anonymity on boards. Dont give advice to natty trainees unless you actually know what you are talking about. Credit your results to strict dieting and genetics. When questioned about steroids say no. Do not reveal any knowledge about gear. Dont be a fucking moron. ,bodybuilding,cqj8j9w,24,t5_2ql8s

3757076,0,t1_cqkijno,I wouldnt be able to tell you how many days out you should carb up for your best results. Ill explain it like this..... When you start to carb deplete you start to lose fat tissue however the longer you carb deplete you start to lose muscle tissue as well. I notice with myself If i totally cut carbohydrates out of my diet within  days I start to become catabolicYou know this feeling when you cant get a pump in the gym you look like youre lbs lighter weak tired. If I do about  grams of carbohydrates per meal then it takes me about  days before I start to become catabolic. Once you get to the point where youre flatCatabolic its takes a few days for your muscles to fill up with that glycogen again. So if on a scale of  zero being catabolic five being full you want to hover around  days before your show so you can fill up easier... It takes me around days to fill up really nice. So if I am not maintaining myself at a two or three on that scale I wont look full at my show. so to break it down easier to get from zero to two takes me two days. I want to show up to my show at  fullness right? That means days before my show I better be a  so when I go above my g carbohydrate intake by show day I will be a .Edit You might have to read slow to understand my grammar is horrible...Edit  I have come to the conclusion drawing a chart to explain this would make much more sense but Its AM and I refuse to do one at this moment...

Pull. Push. LegsRest days are taken when needed not scheduled.The first  days are the big  lifts and then accessory work for those lifts standard powerlifting style.  The second  days are more bodybuilding oriented and I do higher reps and sets.  I do power cleans bench and squat on the bodybuilding days but for  sets of  reps and then the rest is all  reps per set.I found this split to be much better for me because simply doing the big lifts at the beginning of a regular push or pull day was not enough volume for my lifts.  Having them on there separate days where I can do  sets with  reps per set and then do accessory work for the lifts has been much better.

I really think if you have trouble with a muscle firing slow contraction and light weight is the way to go with volume reps.Once I did this squatted and deadlifted and no knee pain or left leg dominance. I dont know what your exact problem with firing the quad is but I find it helpful to not only THINK about the muscle contracting during the movement to also poke and prod at it during contraction to try to eliminate any soft spots.Best of luck. ,bodybuilding,cr8226l,2,t5_2ql8s

Im going to operate under the assumption that youre new to this. Im not trying to be mean or discourage you in fact I want to do the exact opposite. Youll make it but you need to understand where youre at first. Everything needs work. Concentrate on the major compounds to get your lifts up. Dont neglect isos but theyre not your main focus right now. Cardio and tracking calories to shed lbs. Youre heavy enough that the rfitness standard of lbweek cutting can safely be ignored for a while. Aim for  at first. As your weight loss slows keep dropping calories to keep it above lb per week. No joke if you havent been lifting much before you might have as little as lbs of lean mass under there.Diet is the absolute most important part of this. Track everything that goes into your mouth. Count macros. This is a life style change and commitment not something you do for a a few months. You got this its not hard. All the information is out there and its not that complicated. You just have to be disciplined enough to stick to your plan. Stay hungry for knowledge. Stick to your guns. You got this. In  months youll be a completely different person.

3994977,0,t3_3682g8,I do think there is a correlation with anxiety and lack of gains. True anxiety disorders can get to you down on a deep neurological level to where it feels like a physical illness that you just cant quite figure out. Your nervous system becomes hyperactive and over long periods of time it starts to struggle and can make you foggy headed weak constantly dizzy tense less resilient to exercise and overall just bad... Your nervous sytem needs to be able to relax between lifting sessions so it can send healing energy to the affected muscles to build them but if you are constantly tense and on edge then you cant truly recover adequately. Anxiety also gets into your sleep quality which can affect your recovery even more. I have thought about this stuff because I feel like Im in the same boat as you. Putting in more than Im getting back... I have a pretty strong anxiety disorder with bouts of depression.I dont know what your diet and everything is like but if you wanted to seriously attack this thing do what needs to be done to get your nervous system to relax on a deep level. Stop all stimulants or atleast keep them to a bare minimum no coffee some green tea but not more than  or  cups a day. Try to do full body stretching routines more often. Ive found that stretching makes me feel a lot more calm and relaxed this will also help with recovery. This next one is a tough sell for some people but if you havent tried it look seriously into meditation. I really think its one of the only ways to truly calm your nervous system down on a deep level if you give it a chance to. The science on meditation now is pretty clear... that shit can change you both physically and mentally. I feel like it should be part of the bodybuilders arsenal almost treating it as a tool for active recovery instead of just hoping you are recovering between lifting sessions by eating a lot and sleeping.The last thing Ill say is that for probably most of us on here our perception of our progress is extremely distorted. Being you day in and day out knowing every rep and set youve done over the past year or two and how much work youve put into yourself and looking in the mirror to see that nothing has changed... that might not actually be the case. Perhaps your expectation of where you think you should be in comparison to where you actually are is causing your brain to perceive yourself as staying the same or not making progress. Its tough to see yourself objectively. A lot of times when you feel like youre drudging through your routines and not getting anywhere one of your friends who hasnt seen you in a while will see you now and be like dude! you been liftin or somethin? Other people can see your progress much more than you can... In other words our brains are fucked! haha good luck bro were all gonna make it maybe ,bodybuilding,crbnspk,6,t5_2ql8s

Got bloods taken and T is at  free T sub .  Wants me to go see an Endo since trt is not something she was comfortable with for someone so young.  Go to Endo same story as probably everyone these guys are booked out took  weeks to see any of them.  She deep dives into things which i appreciate.  Make some macro changes up my fats to .glb was previously about half that.  Trying to stay shredded year around natty...im dumb.  No more day workouts.  No more  day a week lifting.  Wanted me to drop everything back.   workouts a week.  time to recover.  On top of lifting  days a week i was running in the mornings and doing a long slow distance run on weekends.  She thought it was overtraining related.  She regularly sees college athletes with the same problems.This sounded good as i was already reverse dieting so I followed the instructions and got my calories up but libido never came back and the grogginess and brain fog stayed.got bloods again up to the  or so free T still really low.  I wanted to give it more time of reverse dieting.  Considering how big i am  at the time  i was probably still running on a deficit and she agreed.  Went another six weeks reverse dieting test makes it to  but still no resolution of the issues.  Got a second opinion from another endo on treatment plans.  The story was the same from everyone.  Avoid TRT if possible so young youre signing up for a lifetime of injections according to them better to try a restart protocol.Get bloods again test is back down to  which the nd opinion doc was perplexed.  Agreed that i should try a restart.The initial endo I saw is a lot more experienced with this.  She says her clomid patients do alright but that it is usually  effective getting the natural test production going while HCG she usually sees success in  of patients.  At this point I am just trying to get my sex life back.  This shit has ruined my social life.  I do some research and decide to go with HCG to start might as well go with what she has seen works best.So im doing  IU  days a week.I have to say it is definitely doing something a week in.  Libido is coming back not at all what it was before but it is something.  Ive been weirdly bloated.  Based off my research that is from HCG boosting estrogen.  I have also been ridiculously sore after workouts.  im getting bloods in  weeks so if you remind me i can update you if this works or not.  ,bodybuilding,crwbvm4,1,t5_2ql8s

4189863,0,t1_crxtdo2,Ive got a slightly different perspective as a trans guy who has been injecting test as HRT. I think the main reason youd want to wait a bit before hopping on is that it usually takes a couple years in the gym to build up a solid muscle base learn your body and how it moves how it grows what everything feels like and to let your joints adapt to the stress of heavy lifting and muscle growth. Im a new lifter and have experienced a lot of joint issues due to the test. I imagine going from basically no testosterone to middle normal range levels might be kinda like going from normal levels to superhuman levels.My muscles are growing so fast now that it hurts sometimes.

This could be a viable option if you dont have many gyms nearby and it would still be worth the price for some customers to go there.Less Aggressive option would just be putting up posters and no fee increase.

4328194,0,t1_csdhgix,I have taken measurements in regards to different rep ranges Ive used in regards to specific muscles. Not exactly sure if my experiments were... valid? Anyways so I kept diet as consistent as possible on a slight bulk at  caloric surplus and creatine use was the same as well. For example lets say I was measuring quads one week I would go really heavy say work up to my PR then all accessory work was between  rep range. I would take measurements of the pump then take a measurement the next day then once more the following day just because my measurements are at least a quarter inch smaller the immediate day after a workout. I think I had two weeks straight I did the same then did higher reps for the next two weeks and took measurements the same way. Two more weeks of strength then two more weeks of higher reps.

Is injecting Test E daily or should you do prop x weekly or cyp bimonthly? Should you mix test Ecypprop for maximal results? Dbol kickstart at  gram daily?    You have no idea what or why you are doing what you are doing. You are just taking a brocycle passed on from bro to bro. And in  years when all the bros start dying offhealth complications you are gonna give PEDS and the sport a bad name because dumbasses like you never knew what the fuck they were doing.

4842214,0,t3_3h6ry1,Well my relationship isnt as long as some of the ones here  weve been dating almost  years now and have lived together for over  of it now. Honestly its probably improved my relationship if anything. He was the one who got me started in competing. I mentioned it to him and showed him some stuff and he took it upon himself to talk to our gym about sponsorship and pay for my trainer. He got the ball rolling for me because I would have never done it if he hadnt. He completely supports me and while he doesnt lift he loves the fact that I love it and love competing. And no he doesnt mind the fact that I get on stage in a tiny bikini and heels in front of hundreds of people. I think he likes the confidence Ive found I had none before. Hes gotten critical of peoples bodies though. Even girls on the chive he talks about how she needs more shoulders haha. Weve only argued about it once or twice. It was really just cause I was being a bitch and not wanting to move my gym time to earlier or later in the day. It didnt matter when I did it so Im not sure why I didnt just.... Go earlier or later haha. But I try and make my prep as easy as possible on him. I dont refuse to have his favorite snacks in the house because I cant see them. I dont mind not having the same dinner as him and it doesnt bother me to make him chicken Alfredo while I have chicken and asparagus and sweet potatoes. TLDR bodybuilding has probably strengthened my relationship because Ive gained confidence and he hated how down on myself I could be before. ,bodybuilding,cu4wcf2,8,t5_2ql8s

Natural nationals is actually this weekend. So you can get a good look at the level of competitors that are natural. They do random drug testing and test the overall winners. In the open CBBF show it is completely untested. Many figure girls that I know can compete in both natural and open. Its definitely doable to be a natural figure girl just might take some time to get to national level. I competed in bikini nationally in both natural and open.

5030257,0,t3_3ju92f,Hard to really see what you could be doing wrong without a good video of your lift.Im just going to throw out a guess at what it could be for now. As you said your hammies are weak thus you cant get that good drive off the ground. You might not be tight at the bottom of the lift. So when you start you have this massive surge of power trying jerking it up. But as soon as you get tight you lose all that power. Try to be in a position where you are nearly pulling it up to start the lift rather than loose and jerking it off the ground. lt This is my coach Nathan Wallace deadlifting kg.

I think thats a pretty sweet lbsweek ratio. Started at  lbs almost . inch arms so i wouldnt consider myself a total beginner.I consume  cals a day. And at times do a ton of cardio on top of that. Strenght is not down. I incline db bench the s for  reps. If that is any kind of strenght to you. Anecdotes and my own experience tells me people overestimate how much muscle they will lose by cutting calories by alot. You lose water you lose tissue you lose glycogen storage capability you lose fat on your bodyparts and your inches go down.

He sports his possessions as though they are an indicator of his level of success. Most people come to realize at some point in life that this is simply not true. Hence why the majority of his fans are young guys under  wanting to also live the dream with fast cars fancy shoes and blonde babes. This is as opposed to somebody like Steve Cook who is just as if not more successful but brings a much more believable and balanced personalty to the table.I think many people also get caught up in his pseudointellectualism much like they do with Kai Greene.

However my main issues are not related to the results but to the management.  Some people seem to throw their hands up and argue that this is just the way the sport runs. But if you arent trying to improve things why bother?  My goal is to make things better. Lets improve the judging. Improve the transparency and processes. Improve the ethics and probity. Make it better and fairer for the competitors. If the INBA and other federations keep going down this track they will ultimately fail  competitors and sponsors will lose trust and move to federations that treat them better.,bodybuilding,cvpysjs,3,t5_2ql8s

And posts like that arent really tuned in to a bodybuilding subs point as a place to appreciate the sport.   As the sidebar says There are other subreddits better suited to those just interested in staying fit or building a beach body or lifting weights.  I guess separating them might not be bad so that the mirin thread stays pure and gives everyone some badass physiques to work towardsshowcases our real competitors.  I am not DYEL but since I dont compete or plan on it I refrain from posting pics in order to keep the subs quality higher.  Real bodybuilders just take their physiques to an extra level that I wontcant.

5458768,0,t3_3ptvs7,So my friend  ish  bf hit me up a few weeks ago and asked me if I could help him lose weight what to eat exercise etc... so me being the helpful person I am educated him about the importance of diet and the only real way to lose weight is to be at a calorie deficit but working out will also assist. I tell him to google a TDEE calc to determine how much calories he needs and then eat at like  less so he would be losing about a pound a week. I was busy with work and school so I couldnt really check up on him. This mofo messages me today going off on me telling me I lied to him and eating less wasnt helping cause he went to the doctor yesterday and he found out he gained like  lbs. Im just like wtf and told him to tell me exactly what be was doing for past few weeks he told me he calculates his tdee and it came out to be  so he was eating  a day and talking  minute walks  times a week. I was like there was no way his tdee is that high and told him he probably made a mistake in calculating which obviously made him go off even more. This delusional dude actually put that he was heavily active cause he was working out  times a week and that he was  bf because he googled a body fat picture chart and he assumed he looked the most like . I decided to just be blunt with him and tell him he was may more than  and he should put lightly active instead but he just got mad and told me I dont even know what Im talking about and I probably just starve myself. It amazes me just how much people overestimate how active they are and underestimate how much calories they take in. Even though he said he was eating  it was more like over  cause I checked his myfitnesspal log and  he did not include any of the dressingscondiments he was using or all the vitamin water he was drinking still surprised people think its healthy. I told him its not my fault he doesnt know how to calculate and he told me to duck off and that he is just gonna hire a personal trainer. I just decided to leave it at that. I tried to help him but if he doesnt want it and would rather  a month for a trainer thats his problem now.rantIn other news does anyone know of any appssites that calculates the nutritional info about sandwiches.,bodybuilding,cw9eqve,114,t5_2ql8s

5502710,0,t3_3qgp74,You are wanting too many things that contradict. You say you cant lose weight which the blatant obvious response to that is going to be to lower your calorie intake. Youre also complaining about being hungry that just comes with the territory man. Dont take this the wrong way but dont bitch about dying of hunger you are incredibly privileged to be able to live in a society that allows you the opportunity to manipulate your food intake as you see fit. As for helping with the hunger are you drinking a lot of water? That normally helps me out. I also eat a lot of raw or steamed veggies like a shit load. Vegatables are just basically water and fiber and from the sound of it you could use a little more. Also your fat content is pretty low for someone your size. Perhaps raise it to gday and adjust your carb intake. If your hunger is still a problem try stimulants. If youve been eating kcalday for two weeks and havent dropped weight then yeah if I was your coach Id cut your carbs too.

You could do Nolvadex Tamoxifen but some say its overkill and could diminish gains from LGD. I am doing Toremfine for  weeks at mg a day  week after I finish LGD because halflife isnt as long as Test and  grams of DAA with that. Additionally some have said a PCT of DAA is plenty I am just playing it safe. ujuicedupmonkeyman has said hes seen plenty of people only use DAA and recover fine.

5624004,0,t3_3s4nqz,Currently on LGD. Definitely works. Progressing much faster than natural and much stronger too. Defo still need PCT much weaker than a typical aas cycle tho.They are not as toxic to liver if at all so they are better than oral aas in that regard. LGD doesnt aromatise too so no gyno.Downsides are theyre a bit costly tbh same price as buying actual aas but they carry less risk and imo are great for testing the waters before you jump on an actual cycle.They are very early stages. Im sure youll see more of themtheyre likely to replace aas altogether in a few years. Or oral ones at least. They probably arent used a lot because Im sure most experienced people would rather just use test. Also because long term effects arent really known.Dont listen to the dude here who says you dont need PCT because  it supresses the shit out of you even at the studies low doses of mg when everyone who uses it takes mg you can be sure to have much lower test levels..,bodybuilding,cwu7m7n,18,t5_2ql8s

Im just saying that noviceearly intermediate lifters which in a typical commercial gym is almost everyone who can make workouttoworkout or weektoweek progress in massstrength using the core barbell lifts should not be wasting their time with a bunch of accessories. Those core exercises produce the most adaption in the muscles and your body has a limited amount of resources to recover and gain mass. If youre doing a bunch of accessories as a noviceearly intermediate it fucks with your largest mass gains from the core lifts. pound scrawny guys see big guys who have been lifting for years or are on steroids and quite possibly dont know anything about naturals should train doing splits with limited barbell training and think thats the best way to get big.

Imagining a world where running or lifting weights didnt make you more fit or improve your physique is like imagining a world with no rules of thermodynamics and physics. It just isnt comprehensible. The thing is all of those things you mentioned movies restaurant food rugby they DO give you a benefit. And that benefit may not be physique or personal improvement related but they do give you benefits to other aspects of your life. So to just negate one type of benefit a.k.a improving your fitnessphysique is a bit unfair. What if i said sports no longer would provide you with happiness from winning or making a great play or no adrenaline rush from making an insane tackle?

Its still a character that hes playing its just that in Ninjas case hes playing it  .If Dom never broke character and acted like that  of the time would he be still Mike Tornabene or would he be Dom Mazetti?

5920309,0,t3_3wb0kw,Started off as a bet for a few guys from work and myself. Had always worked out since middle school football never knew what a six pack was. Started prepping in January for a show in April too fat. Said I would do a show in June still you fat after losing  pounds. After telling everyone I know that I was doing a show and missing two of them I really buckled down. I competed this year in November in my first show. Took a lot more than I ever thought it would  pounds and  months of dieting but was worth all of it. I was stubborn and wanted to do it myself so I didnt get a coach big mistake. I wish I had a coach for help with posing if nothing else I just did physique. Im doing my second show in June this year and will do classic physique if they have the division and am hiring a coach. The thing that really motivated me and let me know I was ready was me feeling at first like I let everyone else around me down but realizing I was letting MYSELF down by not giving it my all. You have to want to do the show for yourself. Its not about what other people think what your coach thinks or even what the judges say. Its about you wanting to push yourself to be the best you can be and fuck all else. Even if you come in last and have it your best shot you did it and not a lot of other people have the determination resolve or balls to do that. Just jump in head first and dont look back.,bodybuilding,cxvomiw,1,t5_2ql8s

Crushed work yesterday it was slow until  and then all hell broke loose so I didnt get out of work until an hour after usual but I got praise from quite a few managers for solving the problems so quickly.Went to the gym and really pushed shouldersbi. Had a really good pump and yeah just another usual day.Went to the grocery store right after and not ft into the store I got this guy behind me asking me to slow down and talk. Ends up he works in social mediamarketing and offered me an endorsement package. We traded numbers and he said hed call later this week. Im about  sure its gp but the company name doesnt lead to any camming sites. Gonna stay chill on this until I find out more info.Finally right after this I hit the main aisle of the grocery store and started to text my friend about what had just happened. Before I started texting though I saw my ex about  of the way down the main aisle and she was walking towards me. She ended up coming up to me and paused to talk but I was still on my phone so she just did this awkward pause to talk and then kept walking. Aint nobody got time for that.I bought two tickets for local concerts earlier Yellow Claw on Wednesday and BFMV thursday. Ive got a job interview on Wednesday morning for a new position at a company mi closer which is really nice.

If I claimed that I only lost lb of muscle out of a lb total weight loss Id be dreaming.  Heck even on steroids youre not guaranteed to lose no muscle on a cut.Lyle Mcdonald even talks about this  we dont live in a perfect world where we can bulk and put on only muscle or cut and only lose fat.  The amount of muscle lost on a cut CAN be significant if you lose a lot of weight.  Sure if you only lose lbs in total then only lb of that will be muscle but if you start losing  lbs expect a whole lot more muscle loss.,bodybuilding,d0lh1ga,1,t5_2ql8s

6886806,0,t3_4a2s5q,According to Californias government site. If a drug might be associated with cancer in more than  individuals over the course of  years it poses a significant risk. Meaning if  people were exposed to one or multiple of the compounds in a fooddrugsupplement etc... for  years and more than  got cancer it makes the list.There are at least  ways for something to make the list of ingredientsfood dyespesticidespreservatives that California keeps that requires businesses to show that warning. Each of these ways determines that the compound is either definitively carcinogenic or has the capacity to be determined to pose a significant risk. The law also applies with compounds that will or may cause reproductive damage.Look up the ingredients in your supplement and determine their risk vs. reward and make a judgement based on that. The outcome of the law passed by California that required these statements has its positives and negatives but since Im not wellversed enough in it or wht it was created i dont feel comfortable forming an educated opinion. ,bodybuilding,d0wxq2h,2,t5_2ql8s

6905190,0,t1_d0z0keu,Hey man thanks for the long response! This was exactly what I needed. I used a caliper that put me at  so your estimate sounds about right. The shows are all about  weeks apart so it was more picking a show that worked with my schedule more than picking based on time. I still live at home and parents arent too supportive they dont mind me doing this but they arent willing to adapt their diet to mine. My mom cooks more food for dinner if Im bulking but wont change the specific food. Most likely halfway through my cut Ill start preparing all my meals myself but having counted caloriesmacros for the past few years Ill be able to start the cut just adapting the meals I do already control myself such as breakfast and work meals. Luckily I dont really like sweet foods so temptation has never been an issue for me. Im in canada so I dont believe there are any NPC shows but the ones Im looking at are tested and from what I can tell not that popular as theres pretty much only  beginner shows in my entire province a year. The registration cost was only  a year plus  per show so overall  a year in fees isnt too bad. I do pose a bit but I think out of everything this will be my biggest issue. Ive learnt to flex a lot better in the past year particularily my back but as I dont know anyone that competes it is very hard to judge myself.Contact me through instagram though for sure Id love to have some help and you sound very knowledgable!,bodybuilding,d0z0ty9,1,t5_2ql8s
6905255,0,t3_4aba7f,I dont think PHAT is a good program unless youre an early intermediate lifter. Training a big variation in rep ranges all at the same time is counterproductive to late intermediate and advanced athletes who by definition cant increase their performance on all rep ranges simultaneously. Its a really good program for a short amount of time basically. If you adjust the rep ranges and number of sets then it could potentially be good indefinitely.Edit The Arnold structure doesnt have to lead to subpar back development but I certainly concede that its a structure which would more likely result in that.,bodybuilding,d0z13i9,1,t5_2ql8s

6962083,0,t1_d15ds4c, months is plenty of time to come around for bikini. Many girls do it in  months and do a quick bulkcut to get to a competitive figure. How well they place really depends on genetics and how much muscle they had beforehand.You dont mention your bodybuilding experience prior to making this decision but Im going to assume youre brand new as a worst case scenario. To do well in a bikini competition you need to build a physique that has balance and retains feminine curves at lower bodyfat levels. Theres also an importance placed on appearance skin tone etc that is outside of direct gym work. Finally youll need to work on posing and stage presence to be able to properly flex and present the different muscles of the body on stage I recommend you watch a few bikini competitions if you havent already to get an idea.CoachingIn regards to coaching some people recommend personal coaches to get them into stage shape. I personally am extremely wary of most coaches because of how the majority of them are exbikini competitors that competed once and decided that qualifies them to coach. There is much more that goes into being a good bikini coach than anecdotal experience and most newbies really have no idea if theyre paying good money to receive bad advice handed down by word of mouth. Just because something works doesnt mean it is the healthiest or best way to approach a topic. This is particularly true of dieting a topic Ill hit in a bit as good coaching doesnt end the day of the competition but will continue to help you return your stage body to a healthysustainable level.If you do want to pursue coaching find someone who has professional credentials and multiple competitionswins under their belt. Dont be afraid to look up malenonbikini coaches either as smart nutrition and exercise plans cross multiple athletic boundaries. Layne Norton for example is a competitive powerlifter who has coached many bikini athletes to success by training them as athletes rather than models. Keep in mind that you can still be successful by skipping coaching altogether and educating yourself within the  month period. DietingA notoriously dangerous cycle I see is of girls starving themselves at  calories a day while doing HIIT for  hours daily to prepare themselves for a show. If they dont burn themselves up both physicallymentally and crash before the show approaches theyll binge eat once the show is done and balloon up in weight as the body spirals out of its near starvation phase. Dieting is really the intelligent manipulation of a simple formula Calories in  calories out  net result to achieve the best results for your goals. You do not have to eat like a anorexic rabbit to lose fat you do not have to do  hours of cardio a day to stay in shape and you do not have to avoid fats like they are the devil. Be wary of any diet that calls for absolutism like cutting carbs completely or eating once a day or avoiding reward foods altogether. The more rules a diet imposes the more chances you have to break it and therefore feel guilty. Guilt is the last thing you want to deal with especially as the stress and fatigue starts to accumulate. Getting stricter towards the competition date is understandable but you should strive to build a sustainable lifestyle of proper eating first versus approaching this next  months as a phase. Also important is to understand the concept of reverse dieting after a competition and the changes that your body undergoes at low calorie levels. If you do not plan a smart exit out of your stage weight you will find yourself feeling extremely miserable when you put it all back on very quickly part of the reason why yoyo dieting always seems to do more harm than good.Again the best approach is to educate yourself first and foremost since no one has a larger investment in your bodys health than you. I recommend this site for basic nutritional education but you will need to adjust to a competition specific diet over the course of the  months.PosingThis is one area where I actually agree with people who recommend coaching. There is a certain degree of kinesthetic awareness required to really understand the proper poses and holds that accentuate the right body parts. Some people have the ability to watch a few youtube videos and pick up on it right away but the vast majority of others would benefit from having a coach nitpick their routine in person. Note that I said in person because online coaching through a webcam is not going to give a coach the same degree of detail that they would get in person. Again nothing is mandatory and you are completely free to train yourself over the  months. I would recommend you start as early as possible for two reasons   to get comfortable and used to posing even if its just  minutes a day  to build that mindmuscle connection by watching yourself in the mirror as that will also carry into your workouts and help you isolate and target muscle groups better.Exercise planThere are several free exercise routines available online for people who want to get in shape but what I would recommend is looking up bikini athletes whose figures YOU admire and want to emulate. More likely than not if they are well known or have won a few competitions they will have their full program outlined somewhere. For example here is one belonging to Anna Virmajoki who has one of the best bikini bodies imo in the world.For a first year competitor I would really focus on being consistent a lot more than nitpicking routines. If you want to compete and place well you may want to find a good coach to target the appropriate body parts that need to be improved. However if youre doing this for the experience or to develop this into a lifestyle nothing beats the trial and error experience of experimenting on your own and learning what works and why it does. In regards to your competitive Irish dancing I would recommend you choose to focus on one or the other. If Irish dancing is as intensive as I imagine it is it is probably going above and beyond the HIIT or cardio you will have planned for your sessions. I personally train for both powerlifting and bodybuilding and while their overlap is largely similar I would train and diet one way in preparation for a powerlifting meet than I would for bodybuilding. By the nature of any sport niche preparation will give you a competitive edge and I believe the same can be said of yours. If there is a Irish dance competition you have around the same time as the bikini competition I suggest you figure out a way to rearrange the dates so you have a comfortable window between the two.This is all I have at the moment. Full disclosure I am a male who has never competed so everything I have outlined has been from my experience with SOs who have competed and from bodybuilding as a hobby. Time is on your side in this goal so best of luck to you and hopefully youll have some great progress pictures in the future to post back here.,bodybuilding,d15hkmo,31,t5_2ql8s

6966290,0,t3_4b0w6k,OH I just remembered another really awkward one..... I had run out of sports bras and I only had a bandeau basically a tube top for boobs left. So I decided  fuck it I will just use this and it should be fine. I also wore a white shirt because I thought it would match better with my tights.....As I start my workout I realize that this bra is not cutting it and it keeps sliding down and I cant keep stopping to readjust. My nipples did not really look visible in the mirror so I gave it a go.  So I went and took it off and continued. I am on the lat pulldown machine with no bra and my chest pushed out trying to put out some reps. I  then realized that I am probably putting myself in an awkward position as the rowing machine is next to me and there were a groups of guys working in with each other.  Many of which were in direct view of my chest. I was also right in front of the boys locker room.  I quickly finished and left. ,bodybuilding,d15yqm8,4,t5_2ql8s

Your pants can hide your underdeveloped legs or calves. Your shirt can hide your wide waist. Etc.

7059468,0,t1_d1ghfsp,gtis there any benefit in training isolation movements in say the x repset rangeIts tough to do low rep isolations in the  to  rep range because the weight gets too heavy to keep the form correct. Stronger muscles fake over after which it is no longer a isolation movement at all. Also joints will hurt a lot. Needless to say some exercises will be downright dangerous eg calves or downright impossible overhead triceps extension with  to  rep range.Source Had the same train of thought and tried it myself. I rather suggest you find the right rep range for each type of movement you perform. The right rep range for compounds will vary from isolation movements like curls which itself will vary from higher rep range isolation movements like calf raises or forearm curls,bodybuilding,d1gjuii,1,t5_2ql8s

Relax the shoulders start the movement from your serratus swing the weight if you have to bypass delt activation and then at the top of lift focus on squeezingflexing your back which should feel like your middlelower traps and serratus. Its akin to feeling like doing an overhead shrug but without actually having to shrug.,bodybuilding,d1s2bna,2,t5_2ql8s

7163219,0,t3_4dm7tk,From looking at your gram you may want to look for a show that gives you a few more weeks. Peaking at this point will likely have small to no effect on you due to current conditioning level. Those small changes have a magnified effect the leaner you are.  This however is coming from a guy who has only attended a few shows and observed the conditioning of the bikini winners from the crowd. From the bikini girls Ive spoken to they usually dont drop water for the reason you previously mentioned coming in not as dry and they keep carbs pretty moderate  over the course of the week. ,bodybuilding,d1se0vc,1,t5_2ql8s

But I fell apart and overreacted to her not showing up to plans since my anxiety had been running really high and I was at a breaking point and we hadnt talked since then about  months ago. Today I texted her to get rid of the hope that she would come back and we could talk about what happened. I told that avoiding someone who fell apart because of anxiety is not professional and not mature. I realized the way I acted was wrong and I should have been better. But it happened and I cant change that and shes unwilling to talk everything out and thats very disappointing. Dont give people who wont give you the time of day any real estate in your mind.

I buy rd party tips that are recommended in many Amazon reviews.

Ive gotten fairly close to suicide several times the past few years which Im sure has some more underlying problems but this is the first concrete thing thats been found that could be a major cause so Im willing to try pretty much anything.

7772632,0,t1_d3pmuj7,Hell yeah. I used to slightly pride myself being the only one in the gym who could do dips with perfect form. I used to be able to do sets of  with ease after doing them for a while but even with good form they still fucked my shoulder up and I should have listened when my shoulders didnt feel good after. I still have left shoulder problems Im trying to fix. Also though this is a very minority thing but a lot of people just arent strong enough to do dips with good form and anyone I see in the gym who might be doesnt do them. I was doing dips on vacation in my first two months of working out did a bunch of bodyweight stuff back then and I was too weak to do them. As a result my shoulders would shrug and when I went to push up I got a severe pain in my neck and collapsed onto the floor in pain for a good minute. I still have no idea what happened but Id wager I fucked up a disc in my neck. I cant do shrugs too often because if my form isnt  perfect it still hurts. ,bodybuilding,d3pop01,3,t5_2ql8s

I do think that there will always be those who see people who take steroids as cheaters and drug addicts even if theyre not taking them to be better at sports but its good to see them being talked about in such a way.Ideally at some point in the sadly possibly distant future would at least remove steroids from the same class of drugs as cocaine. At best it would be nice to see them treat it more like legal marijuana.

Lying to his face isnt going to help him. gt keep cutting fat but also start lifting high reps.  sets of   exercises per body part. if its too hard create a  day split with back and legs as separate days. I disagree here following this advice hes going to cut down to nothing. Increase calories and try to push more weight. There should be a fair amount of volume but OPs focus should be strength.

Unless you have godtier bicep insertions the size of your arm is mostly dictated by your tricep. When they are underdeveloped like mine are you arms look narrow from the front and side and stickly from the back. It destroys an entire physique. My chest is pretty shit too relative to other body parts but the triceps just kill it. ,bodybuilding,d4ays0e,22,t5_2ql8s

The assumption here which you clearly missed is he carries fat more predominately in those sections and by adding additional emphasis can greater offset fat in those regions instead with definition or muscle gain. Its not fucking rocket science but apparently reading between the lines is. His upper chest looks under developed as does his mid section and lower back which means that fat in those areas will only create a greater separation and be judged poorly.,bodybuilding,d4b5xlk,1,t5_2ql8s

The background in sports definitely means you will have the discipline to do this! Put the time in and you will absolutely get there!Only thing of concern going into figure vs. bikini is there will be more pressure to hop on gear for figure since your competition is much more likely to be on it and it sounds like you are really want to place. Bikini would have a lower percent of competitors needing gear to place high since the judges dont want to see a lot of mass or super lean bodyfat so you might have a better chance of placing if you wanted to stay natural.

People told me that I looked darker than usual. I felt hot but it was a strange kind of warmth I wasnt sweating like u would normally It felt like a different type of sweat.

Im not gonna tell you to go for the pump or really focus on a contraction or shit like that because Ive noticed I can feel my glutes working more when the weight is actually decently heavy.

Got into actual powerliftingstrongman training and competitions near the end of college after a  year comeback.  Anytime my bench went up to  for reps pec strain.  Had to swap from sumo to conventional after repeated adductorhammy issues for the past  years.  Stopped squatting wide.  Then stopped squatting heavy.  Now basically front squats only.  Built my conventional from  max to x my best sumo was .  Got up to  bw but was mostly fat dropped back down slowly to  over the past year deadlift dropped with it.  Was basically only going for dl and ohp gains to workaround the injuries.  Now Im basically resetting jumping on a pplx schedule with no full bench squat or dl.  Mentally grueling as I have associated these lifts with success for about  years but hopeful this will force me to build back up around the bs strengthen weaknesses and add some size along the way.  Dropping the weight on everything focusing on contraction and time under tension vs weight used.  Wish me luck actual body builders.,bodybuilding,d54gpad,3,t5_2ql8s

8233858,0,t1_d56llf1,Replying to this comment but Im really replying to uLTFitness because he deleted his comment as I was typing it. gt I never run because of how shitty it feels and Im starting to think that being able to deadlift nearly  pounds and not being able to run a single mile in under  minutes is a pretty huge gap in athleticismI was in some other sub last week and they were talking about this kind of thing. I can do a ish mile and still deadlift  lbs for reps and they said it wasnt impressive at all because lots of people can run like  minute miles and lots of people can dead lift that much. Yeah too bad not many people can do both things you stupid fucks.Improving your running will be way easier than improving your lifts. Its doable within a few months. It wont feel good at first though. Also the easiest way to actual increase your mile time is not only to just run one mile really fast but also to develop the ability to run like k without stopping. This more than anything will overall make your shorter run speeds way faster. Not sure why it works that way but it does for me and every other real runner I know. ,bodybuilding,d56sdht,0,t5_2ql8s

8444970,0,t3_4vbcvz,So I am  months away from my first ever show. I spent all of the past  or so months preparing  bulking and just recently started cutting  weeks into my cutThe show is going to be NPC  and I am going to be competing in the True Novice Mens Physique competition. Most of the research I have done on NPC shows has resulted in me realizing that most of the competition is going to be on some sort of juice. The problem that this creates for me is the fact that currently I am natural. The extent of my supplement intake is Creatine ZMAs Vitamin D and the little extra testosterone boost I get from my Nitraflex.So my question is should I still plan on competing? Im just afraid of showing up and having everyone be miles ahead of me. Should I even be worried about it since it is a True Novice category? I doubt anyone that has never competed before is going to be juicing that much right? Or should I wait for an allnatural competition? It is way too late for me to hop on anything right now and to be honest  I would want to stay natty as long as I possibly can.Thanks for reading.,bodybuilding,d5x5qss,4,t5_2ql8s

Full control the bar has to reach the exact same point on the chest below the nips for me put a small towel there or something to help. Work on shoulders tucked in chest out arch more wrist in line so the triceps take the load not the shoulders. The cleaner the rep the more beneficial the movement and the load is  leftright as should be. Im kinda like op I must be a left handed because my right side was weaker and smaller and mobility sucked a bit there. Now its fixed from a visual standpoint but theres still a difference when using Dumbbellscable because no  joint is exactly the same. So more paused barbell work is good for me.

8609035,0,t1_d6hnciv,Well after the photos were leaked of Matt wearing a dress the MuscleTech company saw no drop in sales over his promo code or face products. After a few months they decided that it could possibly hurt the image of the company and fired him even though sales had not been effected by the situation. This was after  years of Matt being the number one powerlifting cash cow for MuscleTech products in the middle of a contract with him. Instead of just firing him they deleted all proof that he was ever an athlete and removed his face from anything that hadnt already been sold. It seemed the decision was more based off some old grumpy CEO than the consumers who continued to support Matts promo codes through muscletech. Either way they had the right to make the business decision and Matt seems fine without them but I still think it was a little wacky how rash and quick they removed his face from their history.

8623134,0,t1_d6jhcw8,Thanks for the link! I missed it. I actually disagree though you have to consider that the focus is on the changing behavior specifically of young single guys the ones who would and should be embarking on a career and moving briskly toward the financially stable circumstances that precede marriage and starting  family. I realize that I cant conclusively prove my view but the other view cant be proven either but just in anecdotal terms I was a huge MySpace addict in the mid s and there was definitely a huge difference in the number of pictures and type of pictures that yearold female vs. male users were posting. Girls were posting many MANY more photos and doing lots of posing duckface and otherwise whereas the prevailing view then again only from my experience was that for a guy to post shirtless mirrorselfies was cheesy whereas now its almost standard for any guy who isnt fat or a nerd and its common for such pictures to even be a guys profile picture on Snapchat Tinder or wherever. Instagram itself seems geared more towards bodyshowingoff but the real reasons behind that for many of the selfstyled models is becoming more wellknown the site Tag The Sponsor is apparently being redone at the moment but this is a big article about it Heres a few more examplesAlso another major factor here could be the influence of Hollywood movies and how leading men think of a few right now are practically ALL very muscular these days compare that with s movies where ONLY a few action stars were jacked while every other guy was average or thin. Vin Diesel outraged a lot of feminists in  when he said on a talk show linked below that actors are now under MORE pressure than actresses to be fit  ,bodybuilding,d6jhru5,0,t5_2ql8s

8633011,0,t1_d6kpevk,Well since you asked before. You probably can guess all my reasons although degradation of the human body is a bigger deal to me on religious grounds but why everyone relates to the other side of the scale there is no reason whatsoever that any athlete needs to use illegal PEDs or even should.If itll let you beat someone you couldnt otherwise its cheating.  Nobody needs to cheat or should.  Its still cheating if they do it too and they might have a better source or more money than you.  Then you get to lose because they cheated.  Sucks.If you arent satisfied with your body natty you wont be on gear.  If you would be you shouldnt.Its okay to lose a sporting match.  Its okay not to win the division championship.  The mindset that cannot accept this is truly infantile.  Various forms of cheating are a fact of competition but everyone would be better off if there was less of it and especially of the kind that affected bodies in such a way.  If your hobby requires you to use dangerous drugs it is a bad hobby and you have to ditch it sooner or later despite that some people have gotten away with injecting livestock conditioner into their bodies and strengthening the finances of criminals for years.  If bodybuilding is more than a hobby then you should start seeing a different psychiatrist.  Its fine to never be competitive as a PL even if you could otherwise.  That stuff doesnt really count for anything.  Life is full of things that are important and that isnt.Sports would be fair if no one juiced.  And young children look up to these people.  It would be nice if athletes could compete meaningfully without mortgaging their cardiac future.Psychological disturbance caused by use is also a bigger deal than people think even if it isnt strictly common.I wont reiterate the typical reasons but they do loom large in my thought process also.,bodybuilding,d6kqewz,-3,t5_2ql8s

8659630,0,t3_4yho8g,went out with a friend who proceeded to lecture me on my cut and workout regime despite the fact that he is skinnyfat and weighs probably  lbs. Criticized my diet because I get the vast majority of my carbs from veggies beans and rice. Told me that I should just do what he did and go for an occasional run and eat fruit as a snack if you get hungry. Motherfucker do you honestly think im touching candy or any of that shit right now? He just would not listen when I explained that fruit certainly has its place but it is essentially sugar water with a sprinkling of vitamins and when you are allowed a limited amount of carbs why would I dedicate so many of them to fruit when I could eat a much larger and more filling portion of broccoli. Of course this guy is a fitness expert he owns two adjustable dumbbells! To top it all off the entire time he lectured me he was drinking two damn beers!Also second minirant that has been irking me for awhile. My gym is very small and only has two barbells. Went in the other day and some dude was deadlifting while his gf did squats. I watched him do two sets before asking how many sets he had left he answered . meanwhile his girl had  sets left and was supersetting her squats with sumo deadlifts with a preloaded bar. They both were taking  mins rests then doing very low rep sets. Now there is nothing wrong with Powerlifting style training and everyone is entitled to their workout and to use the equipment how they need it when they get to it first but if you are going to do  sets in a small gym when there is only two barbells and take giant rest periods in between you are just being rude. or maybe im the asshole who knows.,bodybuilding,d6o2imx,5,t5_2ql8s

8680694,0,t3_4yukbx,Of course you can bulk on a full body program and gain muscle... Your program and your caloric intake are two separate entities.  I believe your asking can you get the same results as far as gaining muscle goes when doing a full body split vs a typical bro split.  Full body workouts sometimes neglect certain muscles.  Ive never done full body but I have done an upper lower split which I felt was pretty sufficient as far as building muscle goes.  As long as your breaking your muscles down you will see growth but if your neglecting muscles in your full body workout then you wont see growth.  Thats why people do the typical body building split so they can target their muscles more directly.  But even then there are imbalances with everyone so you need to find what works best for you as far as reaching your goals go.  The last  months Ive been doing chest  times a week to catch it up with the rest of my body because that was the lagging body part.  The past few weeks however I have been working out one muscle group a day working out  days a week for only  minutes each workout and I am seeing awesome results.  So first figure out what you want do you want to be a bodybuilder just be functionally fit be able to lift heavy things then work backwords.tldr full body workout is just about getting a workout in and bro split will target muscles better so figure out what is more important to you,bodybuilding,d6qplrr,1,t5_2ql8s

8734836,0,t3_4zni94,Wew lads....I was doing barbell preacher curls arms tired af at this point after  sets. I got up trying to put that shit away on the rack but there was a dude standing right infront of it with earbuds in so I instinctively walk around to the other side of the rack that had a free spot. As im making my way to the other side of rack this yo fat bitch fitness chick wannabe is curling away right next to the other side so no one can get there and blocking my way so she had to make literally ONE step to the side and move the fuck out of my way and she does. A minute later im walking away from a water fountain and hear some faint Hey you bla fucking bla behind me turn around and that bitch again. I go up to her and she starts bullshitting something along the lines of Hey you know when people are in the middle of the set you know you should wait bla bla. I didnt say antything just looked at her and walked away I thought maybe she was right but as im walking away I realize THIS BITCH WAS CURLING RIGHT NEXT TO THE BARBEL RACK AND SHE WANTS PEOPLE TO WAIT FOR HER TO FINISH??LIKE THE ENTIRE FUCKING GYM NEEDS TO WAIT FOR HER PRINCESS ASS TO FINISH HER CURLS TO ACCESS THE RACK??? HOW ABOUT SHE MOVES HER FAT ASS SOMEWHERE ELSE SO SHE DOESNT GET IN PEOPLES WAY. At that point I got real fucking salty but it was to late to say what I wanted to say cus I already walked away.

8742279,0,t1_d6yflix,You can do it how you want. I tend to not crave when I eat so much fatnon sugar foods but if Im out with friends and were at a bar then fuck it Ill take the hit. Better to live a little than be perfect sugar wise and live in a bubble. Or just get a lettuce wrap buger.      If youre just low carb and not keto which is what Jason does then yeah it wont hurt at all its just be a normal cheat meal. There is also whats called cyclical ketogenic where you do normal carb ups once youre depleted not once a week like their wiki says. Personally Id just do low carb and not keto if it wasnt for fire but having rock stable sugars is kind of important right now.    Best think you can do is just start reducing carbs and from there play with it. Maybe you get to like g and youre super stable maybe you go to g and then every  days or so down a pint of ben and jerrys. As long as you can stick to it and youre stable diabetes wise then youre good.,bodybuilding,d6yfr8p,2,t5_2ql8s

8992721,0,t3_53fvcp,I am a freshman student in college. I have decided to major in Nutrition and Dietetics and have had serious help and training over the summer with my personal trainer. It is almost becoming funny to me that others around me will try to correct me on how I should be eating and drinking. I drink about  gallons of water a day and aim to eat the exact same amount of macronutrients per day. I train incredibly intensely every single day sometimes twice a day when I can. It is very tough and it is very boring. But I fucking love the process. Thats the problem with many people today. They want the product but no one wants to put in the work to get it. They will look for a shortcut or an excuse as to why they cant reach their goal. I have stopped talking to some people because they say I overtrain or that they dont have time to workout or that they could lose weight if they tried. Its infuriating.Go kill your lifts today. Never give less than what you know you can give. ,bodybuilding,d7ssb39,-33,t5_2ql8s

Then youve gotten a meet under your belt and you can get back to being an aesthetic freight train. Powerlifting and bodybuilding really accentuate eachother. Muscle mass leads to an increase in strength potential. If anything youll get stronger during the meet prep then can use that strength to move more weight when youre back to bodybuilding. I do both bodybuilding in the off season to build muscles and work capacity then do a quick peak before a meet and lift some heavy ass weight. Ive got my first sanctioned meet in about  weeks and if I lose my ageweight class at least Ill probably be the most aesthetic one there. Cheers bro!,bodybuilding,d7tlsfw,2,t5_2ql8s

Take it slow and feel where the tension is in the quad.

I was doing a machine shoulder press right across from a weird looking guy doing machine preacher curls. The guy was about    pounds mid s tan skin wearing skin tight underarmor shirt with camo cargo shorts and cap. He was doing the most annoying thing in the world when it comes to working out machines where the person drops the weight that is way too heavy for them and it slams down. He did it about  times before I finally said Hey do you mind not slamming the weight down? Either go less in weight or control your decent. You will break the machine and what youre doing is very loud. He stands up in the middle of a crowded gym and gets in my face and yells GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY FACE MOTHER FUCKER FUCK YOU WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT FUCK YOU. MOTHER FUCKER WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!.....BLAH BLAH BLAH This rant went on and on and eventually I walked away. I had  people come up to me after the fact thanking me and basically told me that this guy does shit like this all the time and someone needs to put him in his place.

9906485,0,t1_daye2yi,since no one is answering band pull parts in different angles have helped me a lot and exercise specialist recommended them.  I cant find a video for the crocodile to open up the thoracic so Ill try and describe them.lay on your side knees bent comfortably with something under your head to keep you neck neutral. you can do these in bed.put your arms out straight in front of you palms facing at shoulder height like a crocodile mouth.  inhale and bring your top arm open and then close back down to the original position each time opening the crocodiles mouth wider until your straight arm is fully extended behind you. allow your head to follow the movement but be sure to keep you chin tucked slightly to avoid compressing the cervical spine.this opens your chest and thoracic spine. breathe into the motion each time. dont hurry to stretch your arm behind you. when you are able to fully extend your arm with your chest fully open breathe into your chest deeply and allow your body to relax into the open pose for several breaths. I also feel this stretch where my obliques attach to my pelvic crest.it may take a few times to find where your bent knees are comfortable in relation to your upper body to offer the most shoulder and thoracic extension. once you master this you can begin to move your extended arm around your body clockwise and counter clockwise to develop excellent shoulder mobility. perform on both sides of the body.hope this helps and is not too confusing ask me any clarifying questions please.,bodybuilding,dayu6tx,1,t5_2ql8s

Makes you a gym ally rather than a creep and opens conversation Side notes aside shes not competing just stress from school. So we talked about her classes and move then conversations just happen afterwards when you see each other.

10053633,0,t3_5jpmu1,Ive recently realized how beneficial body movement on upper back movements are. Imagine somebody swinging a little on lat pulldowns and you might immediately think of them as using body momentum to move more weight rather than hitting the target muscle and therefore doing it wrong. Think about it in terms of ROM. In a lat pulldown when your arms are straight ish and you move your upper body forward youre allowing your upper arm to drift further up vertically and from that involving it in a greater ROM when you bring it down. And when you lean back as you pull youre putting the lats in their best position to contract when youve pulled the bar down.In a row by bringing your torso forward youre achieving the same thing and when you let your torso drift up a little as you pull youre putting the upper back musculature in the best position to contract at the peak of the movement. Strict form is a solid general rule but Id implore anybody to at least try to utilize more upper body movement in this fashion on upper back lifts for a time.,bodybuilding,dbi0hi9,41,t5_2ql8s

10161576,0,t3_5lfxf0,Hey guys kind of a long one so bare with me. I post on here with another account once every few days or so but I am too ashamed to make this post with a known account. Anyways here it goes. Anyone else have a really long dry spell and end up with their mind completely preoccupied by sex all the time? This past week Ive had nothing but shitty workouts cuz all I wanted to do was go home and masturbate. Being the shy autistic type I spent the last year busting my ass in the gym to get in shape thinking it would give me confidence to talk to girls and even though I see more girls noticing me Im still a pussy bitch. So I go on tinder to try to meet girls then plenty of fish and OkCupid only to find no one replies to my messages. Frustrated I decide fine if I cant get a real girl to meet me maybe I can find one to trade pics with and sext with at least to validate myself a little bit but this just leads to an endless cycle where I cant stop sexting and no matter what I do Im just not satisfied. After all this I feel disgusting and ashamed and this leads me to think I will never be good enough for anyone.  I know I need to stop but the first step for me is admitting this and for some reason I feel this community would be the most accepting of my issues. ,bodybuilding,dbvvdab,7,t5_2ql8s

Obviously Calum wanted to keep doing it but it seems there were some differences so he walked. I bet that since Bradley has his own supplement company already he wanted to find cheaper ways to manufacture Origins supps and Calum wanted to keep them simple like they were in the beginning so he left. Idk though its all speculation until Calum addresses it. Either way Bradley is still cool even if he has given into the trends while Calum is the absolute GOAT.,bodybuilding,dc15yf1,28,t5_2ql8s

Had it for  months at its worst I couldnt raise my arm laterally or drive with it or do any vertical pulls because it would feel like its pinching my tendon or shit. Could barely do curls. PT only recommended some rear flyes band work front raises in a V with thumbs up and NSAIDS and no gym. Cool. Couldnt bench without pain and couldnt even Ohp like a lbs DB from repping s...I also had an issue with it where flexing my trap left side where shoulder hurt caused huge pain. Flexing it Rotates my shoulder in and fuckng killed Me. Thats how I would check my shoulder to see if it healed since flexing my trap would flare the pain without pressing movements . I told my pt several times but he made no remark cause fuck me. Its been  months and I wont even have an mri until the end of the month. Our home boy ustrongandweak suggested a Matt Ogus  video where the half natty prince took a lacrosse I could only find tennis ball  to his rear deltslateral delts and sits on the floor or against a wall to break down the knots in your upper back delts. I took it to my trap. The painful one.  The pain legit fucking vanished in minutes its been  days and I havent even touched my pain pills despite popping them daily since October.  I was able to bench pain free today. At no point in the lift was my shoulder in pain. Im weak af now but this is huge to me.

10420501,0,t1_dcp7rsq,Feeling guilt is not the same as truly being sorry. Brad was just taking so much heat he had no choice.  And read Calums comment on the video  Brad agreed to show up to make this vid with me which was a smart move by him. There was more that I was pissed off with. But that was between me and brad. We decided to talk about the points that were already bought up to the public. The other issues we sorted out off camera and are things that he needs to work on himself. He apologized for those other things that I was still mad about and thats all I needed from him. Sure theres more going on with brad but that has nothing to do with me personally its up to him now to handle it the way he sees fit. Hopefully with truth and sincerityTime to move on. Better shit to worry about. I hope this answers any left over questions you might have. Thanks for the love and support. Catch ya later  Seems like Brad is guilty of even more and thats just with Calum.,bodybuilding,dcp8duw,40,t5_2ql8s

In the morning if my face is a little puffy Ill put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do  now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser then a honey almond body scrub and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herbmint facial mask which I leave on for  minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.

The pump was magnificent there was a TON of LCitrulline in it and my fat self felt vascular AF.  The mg of caffeine and the g Beta Alanine made for some great tingles and heat.

What you become in the process is just as important as the actual process of reaching your end goals. Every meal every rep every workout every muscle contraction is either contributing or contaminating your ability to reach your dream body your dream job and life goals. Success and results are not earned overnight you need to take action to start making progress and changes that will allow you to moving forward and get you one step closer to acquiring the success youve visualized for years. Only YOU can decide that you want to make things happen. Its not just about putting in the hours its about what you are doing with those hours youre putting in.

Ive seen a lot of programs that seem to start really low in the beginning but it is just to help build up that strength and make sure form and everything is down. Also depending on your strengthendurance different rep schemes will fatigue you differently. I would suggest if you arent feeling fatigued maybe just doing an AMRAP on your last set. If you are consistently getting over twice the number of suggested reps on all of your AMRAP set then I would consider upping your working weight. Maybe add in additional chest work if you want. If you stick with the plan worst case scenario you see less than desired results but results nonetheless. I dont think you would be cheating yourself out of gains by sticking to this program.,bodybuilding,ddab0id,2,t5_2ql8s

However then at the same time big daddy govt says you can only legally buy from the pharmaceutical industry you see big pharma doesnt make mistakes no one ever gets hurt using their products...sIf we blame drug dealers for heroine overdoses then shouldnt we blame big pharma for prescription overdoses? Same thing is it not? Our steroid dealer sold steroids to people who wanted them. Until someone is harmed why the fuck are we locking people up? My belief is its to preserve a monopoly on drugs for big pharma and carried out via the threat of jail time by our government.  Thats why the media blows it all out of proportion.

You should aiming to aim at least lb a week.Contrary to that other guys opinion I thought your form looked pretty good. Your back did become more horizontal but that is pretty bound to happen in a heavy squat attempt. A few cues I think would work on for you.  Think about pushing your knees forward when you get to that grinding spot in the middle of the whole.  Try standing a tad bit wider and see it  allows you to keep a bit more vertical back angle maybe a few inches wider than your current stance  You might mess around with cutting your depth just a bit it looks like going ATG is causing you some butt wink at the bottom of your squat and this causing your speed to die in the middle of the lift. ,bodybuilding,ddn2kab,3,t5_2ql8s

10821551,0,t1_ddw5pl8,No not really Im actually about the polar opposite of that Cheeto looking bitch. But thats a pretty common thing in most really conservative religious cultures. Its not really any better in the Fundamentalist Christian sects either.Western cultures tend to be more liberal and secular to begin with so we dont see it as much. But spend any time in an extremely conservative area and youll notice things. I grew up in a very religious conservative area in rural Oklahoma. The man was the king of the house in pretty much every friends house. He was the boss. He ate first. The mother got her plate fixed last after the kids. She did all the housework. The man was the disciplinarian. If kids wanted permission for something mom couldnt give it. You had to ask dad because he had authority over the entire house. Mom couldnt go anywhere or spend a penny without dads approval because everything was considered to be his.I still have friends and family back home that follow that dynamic. It blows my mind too. But a huge difference is the fundamental dynamic that women cant even be seen by a man without becoming tainted and worthless in some fundamentalist sects of Islam. Many fundamentalist sects of Christianity require women to cover their heads as well but none require all skin to be covered.Shotgun weddings are a thing in rural Christian areas in America to preserve a womans innocence. Throwing acid on a womans face and honor killings are a thing in strict Muslim areas of the Middle East to preserve the honor of the men in the family. ,bodybuilding,ddw60f3,30,t5_2ql8s

Why lock out on something like flys? Youre taking the majority tension off the muscle its much easier to do a rep lock out wait a second do another lock out repeat. Not to mention locking out on every single rep makes it hard to get in a groove and will recruit other muscle that youre not targeting. Once you have the motor patterns down and a good mind muscle connection youll benefit much more from repping some exercises out at  ROM. Plus hes literally isolating only his chest instead of recruiting tris and delts if he were to lockout.

Although the information presents itself as an official authority of anabolics its really just a solid reference point. Honestly the determinant of cycle length should really be bloodwork. Bloods looking solid BP in check? Add another month. All good again? Take it away. I generally keep my cycles at  months even though my bloods have been more or less perfect after each cycle.

11042111,0,t3_5xjzqd,Hello. I realized that my right shoulder and trap are significantly smaller than my left. During swim season i had some mild shoulder pain but it was towards the end of the season and i just pushed through since it was almost over. I though i just had some joint problems but yesterday i realized that it was more than just a joint problem.  I want to fix this to first off not get injured during swim season lifting or any other physical activity. And second to look more balanced. How do i balance out my shoulder and trap. Do i just exercise both and eventually the right side will catch up or should i focus on it exclusively for a while?

11107243,0,t1_deqy7qa,Who he isHes my boyfriend  Its actually a really nice story how we met too. I love telling it although his version is a little more manly. I was spending summer in the city and I was giving a guided tour to some couchsurfers that I was hosting. I was waiting for another friend of mine who got caught in rush hour traffic his phone died and he never showed up that afternoon we waited hours. It was a really hot day and my couchsurfers actually fell asleep in the little park in the middle of the city centre while waiting for him. He was from the suburbs hes a chef pretty big guy when we first met. Huge foodie and he very rarely came to the city centre but his sister forgot her house keys that day and he figured he would bring his husky for a walk. I was getting ready for my first bodybuilding show eating my chicken and rice and his dog wanted my food.We were friends for quite a while we walked his dog together every few days but then I had to move out of the city and go finish my final year at law school we decided to long distance and he would ride his bike up the motorway every Friday night at pm after work and in the rain bless him stop two days and ride home again. I was getting a lot of shit from my friends in law school for dating just a chef and because of his weight but in all honesty I just love him and he makes me incredibly happy and I got rid of those friends very quickly. I then took the plunge and switched my postgrad law degree to the city Im preparing to go into practise soon  My summer internship starts this summer and Im hoping were going to have our own place this august.His version of events are basicallyYou were incredibly hot I never expected that someone like you would want to date someone like me but I figured at most I could try and get you to sleep with me and if not I enjoyed your company enough to keep you as a friend anyway. Romantic A FHis fitnessI think our relationship has made his reevaluate his life. He didnt care about his weight I didnt care about his weight but then after our first holiday In Greece he was looking through our beach photos and it just made him really sad. He wouldnt let me share any topless photos of him on facebook. I think now that he has a future goal us living together one day having a family etc Hes giving a lot of attention to his health hes making a lot of life changes eating better working out hes quitting smoking and says hes considering another a new career path,bodybuilding,deqzvmb,3,t5_2ql8s

Like almost full keto if you can. Then the week of the trip double whatever youre getting in. Cutting them out will get you dry as youll shed a good amount of water and then upping them will give you dynamite pumps while youre there youll need to at least do the bare minimum for the pump of course. ,bodybuilding,df3d1yr,6,t5_2ql8s

11219776,0,t1_df3pagc,Im no expert here and im sure someone else can help you but I think the gist of it is that insulin drives nutrients into your muscles. Your body only produces so much insulin so supplementing it exogenously will greatly increase the shuttling of nutrients into muscle leading to more growth. They use the same exact insulin diabetics use. Also insulin is always used with growth hormone but I dont exactly know why but Im sure someone here does. It is very dangerous using that level of insulin im sure you know so only really high level people use it,bodybuilding,df3qxbk,3,t5_2ql8s

Mos to these comments come from skinny ass myspace ripped kids on the site who have never done a bulk in their life. I remember back in the when so many of the elite teen lifters here were big with little definition and when it came to competitions you can really see how much size these guys have put on. Those kids on here that are so insecure about gaining some fat for the sake of their gay little  packs GTFO of this website its a bodybuilding site and FAT is a huge part of it. When bulking you will see that many people have a BULK BELLY but this is the sacrifices that you have to make in order to be a monster. I wont stop getting big until I am lbs with a big ass belly God I cant wait for that day. You see members like Babyslayer Nozyt MormonPickett and many many others who Bulk and it motivates the  out of me. Mormon is one of the biggest members here he has a  load of experience and I remember how big he was getting during his COMPETITION and now theres no respect for his accomplishments unless he is lbs with a  pack. We make fun of Facebook kids while people here are striving for that look. This section has turned into insecure ripped kids from Facebook who will never be successful in the lifestyle unless they are willing to put on some fat. If you guys want to be lbs ripped fine go ahead but I want to head towards the freak section and be lbs  dont call out the guys who are twice your size and much stronger because you carry a little  pack.I dont even give a  about abs tbh I know its a part of the sport to be lean and all but I have seen so many guys with amazing physiques who dont have abs at all.,bodybuilding,dfa2svp,8,t5_2ql8s

11308618,0,t3_61e1v4,Lordy. Gonna sound like a dick but Ill try to be helpful and give you as much advice as I can before this gets removed.. You are still a noob not a semi noob. Cutting and bulking are not about your body weight. There is no magical rep range for size and looks. Nutrition matters most. Calculate TDEE. Count calories and macros. Be consistent.Basically you are still a noob. Consider this a good thing because it means youve got a lot of gas in the tank as far as noob gains. Ask any poster here and Im sure theyd love to go back to the rate they grew at when the first started. Now since you will be making noob gains make them count. By this I mean count your calories and macros and bulk. This is a phase when youll be gaining muscle faster naturally than at any other point in your life so dont squander it by trying to lean out. You probably dont have near enough muscle to do a real cut anyway at this point.Regarding training dont go overboard. Regardless of what you think this is still a newer stress on your muscles so dont go too crazy. For your experience level I would recommend Layne Nortons PHAT program for the first couple of months until you feel pretty good about what your doing and then I would begin doing Hany Rambods FST. The biggest things here are to leave your ego at the door and do the weight that you can keep good strict form through each and every rep of the exercise and be consistent with your training. None of that Oh its already late not today. Or I just cant get motivated today. Fuck that. Do the work if you want the results. Otherwise youll just end up like every other  days a week DYEL machine waster that populates every public gym. Also drink a lot of water. Shits good yo.,bodybuilding,dfdtcan,11,t5_2ql8s

Also dislocated shoulders would have been clearly visible on the  xrays you got and would have prevented you from doing anything involving your arms. Herniated discs are not out of place the softer internal material has squished out through the fibrous exterior capsule. The only way to resolve that is to surgical cut out the herniated material or wait for the body to absorb it. You cant just put them back. Rib dislocation is something that can actually happen and adjustments like those performed by a chiropractor are one of the most effective ways of treating them but it sounds like this guy tried to sell you on a bunch of other bullshit to keep you coming back.

However what helped her was her work ethic and showing the instructor that she cared deeply about doing whatever she could to get better. Someone who was a student who sat in the back of the class never made themselves memorable to the instructor never talked to the instructor never saw them during office hours they would not have passed. Is this fair? NO but its how the game goes.  Instructors are human too.

Apparently somewhat better than you can in fact because your first link does not address the topic at all and the second one specifically contradicts what you saygt Athletes should always remember that they should not expect a post cycle therapy to miraculously return their testosterone levels to what they originally were before using steroids.Its possible that this simply means that levels wont return to normal immediately. The article doesnt clarify further. The fact its at best unclear is not encouraging though.Further neither article appears to cite any academic sources at all.All of which is mostly irrelevant because my point was that you didnt know about this at the time of making your recommendation to hop on which in my view is irresponsible.

They had two groups of people that were calorie restricted. One group calorie restricted for  weeks. The other group dieted for the same  weeks but used a cyclic approach. They went  days at a calorie deficit and  days where they could eat what they wanted ad libitum. What they found is that the group that used the cyclic dieting approach lost MORE body fat and maintained a higher metabolism during the  week study. Not only that in the  weeks after the diet the group that calorie cycled maintained an elevated metabolism whereas the group that restricted for  weeks still had a lower metabolism.,bodybuilding,dgl7m2m,1,t5_2ql8s

11803491,0,t3_68f4fe,So I landed on the metal part of a trampoline with my back a couple weeks ago. Apparently I pulled one of my abdomen or something during it. I didnt even know that you could pull and abdomen.Anyways Im gonna go let the doc check it out and go on a quest to find my one missing ab.
