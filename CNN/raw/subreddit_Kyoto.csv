5479194,0,t1_cwc0kvp,Personally I prefer the trains to the buses so thats what I stick with. The only hard part around getting around Kyoto and Japan in general is contending with the multiple public transit companies when you want to get from point A to point B.  helps a lot with that. With AirBnb besides location its usually about how the place looks amenities that you get the daily rate and how your host has been reviewed.,Kyoto,cwc0ny7,3,t5_2tjwl
