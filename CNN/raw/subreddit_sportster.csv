2994556,0,t3_2udtu8,If your breather bolts go thru your air cleaner back plate the plate could have been loose so theres a chance you could have had an intake leak when it was loose which may have had an effect on the cylinder not firing but this seems unlikely. Im not a pro but i think the answer is no a loose breather bolt would not cause this. Fuel compression spark... breather bolts are separate from these. Maybe when you tightened it you moved some wiring a wee bit? Check to make sure all the wiring is in good shape and connections tight. If electrical is all good and it still doesnt fire then do a compression check. ,sportster,co8dtjy,1,t5_2sd0k

4762531,0,t3_3g4uzh,It can definitely be done in your apartment. Removal of the carb is fairly simple even without much mechanical experience. First turn your fuel off at the petcock and run your bike until it shuts off from lack of fuel so that theres as little as possible in the carb bowls. You have to completely remove the air cleaner housing. Should be two bolts at the cover where the  plate it. Then theres two bolts on the inside of the cover after those are out the plastic piece just pulls off. There is a gasket that sits between the plastic air cleaner housing and the carb it will probably stick to the air cleaner housing and should be replaced I believe it is included in the carb kit from harley. Then you need to loosen the retaining nut at the enricher knob on the left side of the bike and slide it down and out of the bracket. Then I remove the fuel line after from the tank instead of the carb but you can do it either way. After that you should mark each of the throttle cables so you remember which is which and then remove them from the carb.   Theres just a little bracket on the right side of the carb with a channel that the cables slide into with a small retaining fixture. This may require loosening the throttle cables at the handlebar side. If you need to loosen the cables count the number of turns and mark that somewhere so you can put it back easier than making the adjustments without the preset. after that the carb just pulls from the throttle body. Theres a rubber mounting grommet that fits on the throttle body that may remain on the throttle body or come off with the carb. Make sure this is in good condition and not hard or cracked. If you think it needs replaced go ahead and do it they arent expensive and if the current one is bad it could cause vacuum leaks. After that theres four screws on the bowl at the bottom that need removed to remove the bowl. You should attempt this either with the carb right side up or in an area that easily cleaned and while wearing disposable gloves because it is likely that a small amount of fuel is still remaining in the bowl. Once the bowl is removed turn the carb upside down and place on your work surface attempt not to disturb the float black plastic thing then you can remove the jets. Your manual should have these labeled with pictures. Just make sure your screwdriver fits the heads nicely because the jets are brass and can be easily damaged using the wrong size screwdriver. When removed they can be easily cleaned with any carb cleaner or replaced with new jets which should only cost a few bucks at the dealer. When reinstalling the jets make sure not to over tighten the just. Once they are snug they are installed like I said earlier the brass can be easily damaged. Reinstall the bowl and then move onto the top. there are four screws there as well but the rear right screw is different because it also secures the idle bracket just remove the screws and set the idle bracket screw to the side so you remember and move the bracket out of the way. Once inside theres the slide gently remove and inspect the diaphragm rubber thing attached to slide and thin spots tears or other damage requires you to replace the slide  from dealer. Inside the slide is the needle jet remove and clean the jet and the two holes in the slide one hole is the needle jet hole and the other is a vacuum hole the one in the center is the needle jet hole. after reinstall and make sure to seat the top cover gently and the the diaphragm is not pinched. Reinstall the screws and the idle bracket. Reverse process for install. Im not sure if you needed all of this but the simple answer is yes you can do it in your apartment.,sportster,ctuv11r,5,t5_2sd0k

5002502,0,t1_cuoijj6,Spring rates are a factor in weight.  For example progressive  heavy duty springs have a higher rated spring to accomodate  pounds while I believe the standards are setup with a spring for  pounds.

5664527,0,t1_cwk0eds,Well I think another issue is that when you start the bike for that first fraction of a second movement it is not lubricated because the oil is not flowing. So if you drive a  mile trip you have that situation once per twenty miles. If you drive   mile trips you have that situation  times for the same twenty miles. ,sportster,cwz8n0p,1,t5_2sd0k
5693152,0,t1_cx2s7rp,Its hard to say but you still have a trap door so you can pull the transmission without splitting the cases.  When people with newer Sportsters have this type of problem it will be a much bigger problem.  I fixed my transmission one time wit a  cent spring.  I replaced the rest of the springs when it was apart but only one was broke.  I had problems with second gear at times but I learned to live with it until one day it finally quit.  If your clutch is adjusted it sounds like you are looking at a similar condition.  You might be looking at a bent shifting fork weak or broken spring worn cam plate in the transmission something stripped etc.  Until you pull it out you wont know for sure.Have you had the shifter off?  If so Id take it back off and rotate it up one or two spline  at first.  It might be that easy.,sportster,cx2shh5,2,t5_2sd0k

9287898,0,t3_57mzlx,Even without overfilling this is normal because of the crankcase vent assuming youre not on an ironhead or early evo which did not vent into the air cleaner. Its not a big deal to vent into the air cleaner but there are other options. You can vent to a horseshoe and route it to wherever or you can replace the screws with others that will just blow the oil out which I wouldnt recommend unless you like oil on your pants.    Personally I upgraded my air cleaner with a kit that had a horseshoe which I run to a small filter that I tucked out of the way.,sportster,d8tb3dl,3,t5_2sd0k

10775795,0,t1_ddrfutn,Valid point about it being rewarding and a fun experience yes. But someone who states that they are planning on using their friends tools probably doesnt have a whole lot of wrenching experience. Ive rebuilt a few bikes before from the frame up and I still get puzzled about some pretty rudimentary stuff. Theres a lot of stuff that needs to be considered when building anything. Especially something that youre trusting your life on. Things like which bolts need to be made of hardened steel and torque specs are things that absolutely need to be considered. Its a huge undertaking and for someone who has never ridden a motorcycle isnt going to even be able to tell if they adjusted their clutch right let alone be able to tell if their wheel isnt true. ,sportster,ddrg1su,2,t5_2sd0k
