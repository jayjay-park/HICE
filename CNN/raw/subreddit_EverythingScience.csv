259956,0,t1_cf7ost0,gtassuming Synetics is well versed in particle physicsQuarks and atoms exist.  We have measured them.  We have measured hadrons in our accelerators and measured particles that have certain characteristics which we name quark of various flavors and colors and such.Nobody has proof of the very first quark.  There are no observations of the very first quark to pop into existence as the rapidly expanding universe coalesced into minute subatomic particles.  I would have named the first quark Steve but again I wasnt there to witness it.  Quarks currently exist and we can say with some certainty that if they didnt exist or if they hadnt existed billions of years ago as the universe cooled then things would be much different than they currently are.  We can examine the distribution of stars in the sky how fast they move away from or towards us and measurements of the cosmic background radiation and draw inferences of how the universe arrived at its current state and how long it took to get here.   The thing is the standard model our current understanding of subatomic particles is a theory.  When a scientist says theory they mean a set of rules and principles extrapolated from a large body of measurements which holds up under rigorous analysis.  They do not say it is truth.  They merely say This works for now.  If we get new data we will reevaluate our answer.  They do not mean I guess I think it works this way so thats the answer and it is intransigent and always THE answer.

Dark matter is the stuff that we KNOW must be around galaxies because we can measure its effects on normal matter even though we cannot directly observe it. Whatever dark matter is and there are some fun theories it is most definitely real.Dark energy is a whole other bag of worms. Dark energy is just what some scientists call the thing that is causing the universe to spread out at a ever more rapid pace and is on track to rip the universe apart at a sub atomic level some day. Dark energy could be soooooooooo many different things at this point and we know very little about it. It might not even be real but instead we might have some other fundamental piece of the how the universe works puzzle totally and helplessly backwards making us think that there is this crazy stuff out there ripping the universe apart.In order to come up with that  number scientists take all the theorized dark matter that it would take to stabilize all of the galaxies and add that to the total required energy to overcome all of the gravity in the universe dark energy basically. Putting them together like that is a little weird. Scientists think that dark matter is roughly  of the total mass of the universe from measuring and simulating galaxies and galactic formation and the amount of energy needed to explain the acceleration of the universe ends up being a ridiculously large number so if it is a real thing then it would account for  of the mass of the universe emc so energy and matter are interchangeable here.

2348684,0,t1_cm1ywgp,From a few photos and a model that Ive seen it does appear that Philae is on a rather steep slope this is speculation and things can change as more data arrives. The risk of falling would be related to something called the angle of repose On Earth this angle is about  degrees. Anything above that angle will slide down that slope. I dont know what an angle like this would be for a comet but my guess is the angle could be quite high before something slips. Philae seems to be on a slope steeper than  degrees but because of the low gravity it may not be as big of a risk though this is speculation. Some instruments such as the MUPUS instrument have been deployed already and that instrument might shake things up a bit with its hammering who knows. Since it may be on its side with its legs in the air a fear may be that it becomes a turtle and falls on its back. If Philae lives long enough to see the comet becoming very active as it nears the Sun then it may easily fall or be kicked around a bit.,EverythingScience,cm20bn9,1,t5_2zlwp

2495102,0,t3_2o5el5,I take the minoritys view point that the best refutation to the Fermi Paradox is that we are alone in the observable universe.   The Eerie Silence by Paul Davies is a good book on the topic.  My review for the book is as follows This is a great book. The greatest potentially answerable question are we alone in the universe? is explored from every imaginable perspective and with its possible ramifications. I dont think any one explains science to nonscientist better than Paul Davies does. He excels at giving both sides of an argument to a dilemma and lets the reader make the informed decision. The book doesnt just look at radio astronomy but considers all the other evidence or lack of evidence for what it takes for other intelligence to be elsewhere in the universe. For example the lack of evidence for nonDNA based life on earth or other planets in our solar system implies that life might not be as easily created as some might state. No systematic harnessing of black hole energy through out parts of the galaxy implies we just might be alone.The narrator is the same one who read The Singularity is Near by Ray Kurzweil. That is good since the themes between the books overlap so much and my mind would naturally go back to that book as I was listening to this book. He gives the best refutation to the Fermi Paradox Ive seen so far. This book is much more than what the title implies. He covers everything related to are we alone? and fairly provides all relevant arguments to the table. He has his opinions and states them but always realizing that its just his opinion and there are not necessarily right answers.  End of review.  My reason for thinking that the Fermi Pardox is not refutable is because I believe that self replicating self aware AI systems will happen fairly soon on our planet and we should have already been visited by advanced AI but have not so far.  For a good book on Advanced AI written by a philosopher I would recommend  Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom my review follows This book is more frightening than any book youll ever read. The author makes a great case for what the future holds for us humans. I believe the concepts in The Singularity is Near by Ray Kurzweil are mostly spot on but the one area Kurzweil dismisses prematurely is how the SI superintelligent advanced artificial intelligence entity will react to its circumstances.The book doesnt really dwell much on how the SI will be created. The author mostly assumes a computer algorithm of some kind with perhaps human brain enhancements. If you reject such an SI entity prima facie this book is not for you since the book mostly deals with assuming such a recursive self aware and self improving entity will be in humanities future.The author makes some incredibly good points. He mostly hypothesizes that the SI entity will be a singleton and not allow others of its kind to be created independently and will happen on a much faster timeline after certain milestones are fulfilled. The book points out how hard it is to put safeguards into a procedure to guard against unintended consequences. For example making the greater good for the greatest many the final goal can lead to unintended consequence such as allowing a Nazi ruled world he doesnt give that example directly in the book and I borrow it from Karl Popper who gave it as a refutation for John Stuart Mills utilitarian philosophy. If the goal is to make us all smile the SI entity might make brain probes that force us to smile. There is no easy end goal specifiable without unintended consequences. This kind of thinking within the book is another reason I can recommend the book. As I was listening I realized that all the ways we try to motivate or control an SI entity to be moral can also be applied to us humans in order to make us moral to. Morality is hard both for us humans and for future SI entities. Theres a movie from the early s called Colossus The Forbin Project it really is a template for this book and I would recommend watching the movie before reading this book. I just recently listened to the book Our Final Invention by James Barrat. That book covers the same material that is presented in this book. This book is much better even though they overlap very much. The reason why is this author Nick Bostrom is a philosopher and knows how to lay out his premises in such a way that the story he is telling is consistent coherent and gives a narrative to tie the pieces together even if the narrative will scare the daylights out of the listener. This author has really thought about the problems inherent in an SI entity and this book will be a template for almost all future books on this subject. ,EverythingScience,cmk8xlr,1,t5_2zlwp

2556525,0,t1_cms8z4p,A few reasons. The most boring is that peer review isnt perfect. It isnt really designed to detect fraud.It took a in depth investigation by journalists at The Sunday Times something like  years after he published for his fraud to begin to be uncovered. With peer review you are asking one or two scientists to notice mistakes after a matter of hours of review.One of the more interesting reasons why it failed to prevent the autism scandal is because Wakefields paper straight out admits that it does not prove any causal link to autism if it had made such a claim likely would have been rejected by referees or made to be edited until it didnt. He made the claims of a link in a press conference and journalists ran with it without reading or understanding the paper and its flaws. Science by press conference is a dangerous phenomena.One of the sad things about it is that the same mistakes the press made here continue to be made every year and the press that was so keen to report on the nonsense link between MMR and autism damns Wakefield as a horrid person while never accepting that they are equally if not more responsible for the deaths that the MMR scandal has caused.,EverythingScience,cms9x6k,12,t5_2zlwp

3304780,0,t1_cp4y1s1,Youre right its not a great source. I chose it because its succinct. For this blog post I was trying to split my audience between some more scienceliterate people and also just casual readers. A general goal Im setting for my blog is to make science accessible to nonscience types so I avoided anything too wordy or detailed. My background is in physics but I have broad interests. As I say Im not a career scientist.Ok Ill draw you an analogy that I think gets at what Im angling for.Im assuming your familiar with the phenomenon of kin selection. If not heres the wikipedia page  So say your topic of interest was emotional attachment to siblings. I find that there are two directions of study you might take on this . is the specific development of emotional attachment to siblings in humans and . is the general principle that causes that emotional attachment to siblings to be an adaptation at all.So for . youre necessarily going to make an argument involving the past and our ancestors. Perhaps along the lines of as early humans began to live in larger groups offering greater protection and stability the average number of offspring began to rise. Therefore there were more siblings and thus we evolved the emotional attachment as one would expect from kin selection. ltltIm not claiming thats true I just made that up as an exampleFor . however youre more interested in why the emotional attachment to siblings is an adaptation at all. Of course this obviously does depend on the actual historical development of our species but you are nonetheless able to abstract back from it to say something like emotional attachment to siblings is likely to cause acts of altruism towards siblings which in accordance with Hamiltons rule is likely to benefit the gene that causes it because that gene has a certain probability of also being carried by the sibling to whom the altruism is directed.Topic . is a plausible mechanism for how to get from a world where humans dont have an emotional attachment to our siblings to a world where humans do. Topic . is a general explanation of why such attachment is likely to come to be across many species and circumstances.My point is that I am interested in the abstract rule if there is one which I believe there is rather than the historical circumstances. Although youre right that they are entailed necessarily in actuality that does not stop us from studying them separately.  My apologies if I didnt make that clear in my original post.So for music an example of topic . would be your suggestion about soothing sounds. It is a plausible mechanism for how to get from a world with no music to a world with music. What I am more interested in though is . why is music an adaptation in general potentially across species and circumstances?In doing this Im implicitly stating that music is currently an adaptation which continues to have survival value and be selected for rather than purely a result of specific historical circumstances. A species of bird having wings is a result of its specific evolutionary circumstances while kin selection applies to a whole range of species across time. In my argument rather than saying that love of music is like that birds wings specific to its circumstances Im claiming that its likely to exist in any animal which has a sufficiently developed brain.,EverythingScience,cp4yzb2,1,t5_2zlwp

The heat and offgassing from spent fuel pools might be increasing the fog in those areas or just become more visible in those atmospheric conditions.  Those pics were taken during the fuel handling crane removal when TEPCO complained that fog hampered their efforts.  For the last three months the fogging grew so dense at times there was zero visibility on the TEPCO cameras.  Dense fog seen on one camera but not the other was not like the normal fog that usually affects both cameras the same.  The dense fogging coincided with peaks of  gamma sparks an hour.

I know a number of people with nonCeliac bowel sensitivity who feel indirectly much healthier when exercising a gluten free diet  including resolution of flareups of psoriasis etc.Meanwhile the selfdiagnosed woo people arent doing you any harm. You can find their request in lieu of a gluten epitopespecific immunological response irritating but for people trying to deal with other types of often poorly diagnosed or specified bowel irritability gluten free options offer many anything between a placebo comfort to an indirect health benefit by contributing to reduction of FODMAPs etc. I still believe preciousness about people having a sufficiently real reason to avoid gluten and the apparent vindictive response some have hurts those with bowel disorders a lot more than it hurts you or I to humour them.

6575159,0,t1_czzbqg2,gt This movement is about making published science available to everyman and everywoman. For the most part at least in the first world working scientists do have access to most papers in our disciplinary fields.This is a rather blithe dismissal of scientists working at poorer institutions. If researchers cant access the literature because they work at an institute that cant afford the subscription packages that the big publishers force you to buy then it actively holds back scientific progress. Even well funded universities cant afford to subscribe to everything as Im sure you know. Giving scientists access to the research they need isnt a happy bonus to open access it should be one of its core goals.I dont think anyone doubts that publishing research costs money but the big publishing houses not society journals have obscene profit margins of around  that are maintained by operating practices that bleed money from the public purse. This all on top of the fact that they get the content and editing for free and actively hamper the progress of research.I dont think the situation with APCs is as dire as you say and many open access journals like PLOS have APC waivers or assistance programs for researchers who dont have funds available to pay them. Im not sure if theyre the right way to solve the problem of access but the bizarre situation we currently have where publicly funded research is being given away and published under lock and key in privately owned forprofit magazines needs to end.,EverythingScience,czzfc4e,2,t5_2zlwp

7204863,0,t1_d1wkuaf,Thank you so much and thank you so much for taking an interest in general public healthcare. Again the thing that gets me those kids in the outreach program were only there because they had health insurance. To get into that outreach program you must have been displaying some kind of behaviour to get you pulled from school. So what happens to the kids who are acting out because of mental disease or problems at home when they dont have health insurance? How many kids who end up in juvenile hall arent acting out because of forces either beyond their control or forces they cant control? Ive been told that the side effects I got from the medicines sounded a lot like what bi polar itself feels like. Imagine thats only a tiny tiny facsimile of what these people feel every day of their lives. After three months I had fought with everyone around me for no discernible reason. After four months I was so tired of being constantly sad or angry and never knowing why I felt like I was going mad like my mind was being torn in two. It was a living waking hell. And there are people who go through this every single day. That blows my mind. I couldnt stand six months of it how can they stand a lifetime having their mind basically at war with itself? Having thoughts you cant control? Feelings you dont understand because they come out of the clear blue? And powerful feelings too I never felt anything like that ever again even at the saddest moments in my life. Like this massive catastrophic panic or immense fear. It blows my mind that people are capable of feeling that every day or every other day or every week and that theyre capable of surviving that. Again we underestimate human tenacity to an incredible degree. We talk a lot about the victims of depression and bi polar when they succumb to it but the ones who survive it? Every day? Holy shit. Thats incredible to me. That shows a strength that is just I dont know superhuman. The therapy the medicine everything a person is willing to go to just to keep on living to be happy. I cant imagine how they do it. You always hear the tragic stories of how bi polar or schizophrenia tear families apart but you never hear the stories of the people who live with it and find their happiness. A dear friend of mine in the outreach program had paranoid schizophrenia but had responded well to the medicine. But as she explained it to me it wasnt that it made the hallucinations go away it just made her aware of them being hallucinations. Once I finally asked her what that was like and she calmly explained to me that as she and I stood there talking by the bus stop she could see a thing watching us from a nearby light pole. And that was how it was every day. If I hadnt asked her I would have never known. She was outgoing she was very social and personable. She was living her life as normally as you could imagine. Youd never know unless she told you. That girl was all of fifteen years old. I still think back on this and Im completely staggered. But without help no one can be expected to survive like this. Our treatment of people who suffer from mental conditions is absurd. You see them out in Skid Row in LA and in the streets of Orange County too. Nevada was recently caught simply gathering up their mentally ill homeless and putting them on a bus to LA. Just a couple of days ago there was this tiny old man walking in the middle of traffic bewildered talking at random having absolutely no notion that he was in the middle of moving traffic. Another time in a really cold rainy day there was another old homeless man pushing a shopping cart and screaming and ranting at random alone in the cold in soaking wet clothes.

8227871,0,t1_d55zgl2,Not a stupid question at all and in fact one of the most commonly misunderstood.Probability Theory is the same for both the Frequentist and Bayesian viewpoints. They both axiomatize on the measure theoretic Komolgorov axiomatization of probability theory.The discrepancy is how the Frequentist and Bayesians handle the inference of probability. The Frequentists restrict themselves to treating probabilities as the limit of longrun repeatable trials. If a trial is not repeatable the idea of probability is meaningless to them. Meanwhile the Bayesians treat probability as a subjective belief permitting themselves the use of prior information wherein the initial subjective belief is encoded. There are different schools of thought about how to pick those priors when one lacks bootstrapping information to try to maximize learning rate such as maximum entropy.Whomever you believe has the correct view this is and always will be a completely philosophical argument. There is no mathematical framework that will tell you whether one is correctthough certainly utilitarian arguments can be made for the improvement of various social programs through the use of applications of statistics where Frequentists would not otherwise dare treadas can similar arguments be made for the risk thereby imposed.,EverythingScience,d561gf4,14,t5_2zlwp

8543176,0,t3_4ws8s5,gtAdvances in Political Psychology Forthcoming gtAbstract      gtThis paper describes evidence suggesting that science curiosity counteracts politically biased information processing. This finding is in tension with two bodies of research. The first casts doubt on the existence of curiosity as a measurable disposition. The other suggests that individual differences in cognition related to science comprehension  of which science curiosity if it exists would presumably be one  do not mitigate politically biased information processing but instead aggravate it. The paper describes the scaledevelopment strategy employed to overcome the problems associated with measuring science curiosity. It also reports data observational and experimental showing that science curiosity promotes openminded engagement with information that is contrary to individuals political predispositions. We conclude by identifying a series of concrete research questions posed by these results.,EverythingScience,d69gt57,1,t5_2zlwp
8556914,0,t1_d6b562l,Non hemolytic bacteria in general arent what we are concerned about. Bacillus species have a very distinctive look and are very easy to spot in a culture. They are often seen as contaminants because they are everywhere. Most bacillus species are hemolytic and harmless but one of the defining characteristics of B. anthracis is that it is nonhemolytic. B. anthracis is very infectious to people working with the culture. For this reason we are required to investigate any nonhemolytic bacillus in case it is anthracis. Another defining feature of anthracis is that it is nonmotile so that is the next step. If it is motile than you can ignore it. If it is nonmotile we send it to the state hygienic lab to confirm it is anthracis. If it is everyone in the lab that day gets to spend the next month or so taking antibiotics with some really fun side effects. If it isnt then everyone breaths a sigh of relief.It might be important to point out that Im not referring to rod shaped bacteria which are called bacilli or bacillus but the genus of bacteria called bacillus. ,EverythingScience,d6b6uek,13,t5_2zlwp

In the Senate McConnell too may support rolling back the funding for scientific grants.This would lead to a tangible decrease in American scientific output.
