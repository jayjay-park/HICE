11020752,0,t1_defkvqd,When I was growing up I lived in the forest and was able to have a ton of cool pets like foxes raccoons etc. They came and went as they pleased.However my bunnies and ferret werent as smart so we had to keep them inside. Their cage was small ebcause our house was small. I remember my dad made a little wire tube with a sheet metal floor that we covered in faux fur. He ran that tube up near the ceiling all through the house and they ran around up there all day. It was awesome.,Gifting,deh6735,2,t5_2qt1g
