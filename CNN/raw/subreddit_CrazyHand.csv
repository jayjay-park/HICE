2059456,0,t3_2iesvp,Well first try them out in training on sandbagcpu. Practice charging the neutral special to send Luma the right distance for different situations and practice calling Luma back when you need to. Work on using all of the different tilts and smashes with both characters and get a feel for the damage and knock back. Its important to use Luma as a wall to keep the opponent away from Rosalina then attack them with Rosalina when they dont expect it. ,CrazyHand,cl1loi0,1,t5_33vle

2230498,0,t3_2kozk3,First and foremost you need to get accustomed to the mechanics and physic of the game. Play with lvl  bots until you can beat them. This is really just to give you a feel of the game. do not overthink this this is really just basic practice. Actually beating lvl  cpu is just a benchmark that I use feel free to proceed when you feel readyOnce that his done the real practice begin.. Read on your character. Everything you can. The more you know your character the better you will be. Here is some resource to get you started . Practice advanced tech. Basically you go into practice mode and practice all the technique you read about until you can pull them off any time you want.. Find a training partner preferably one that his better than you and play with him as much as you can. Here a website to find one . Save your replay of your bad game. The one where you get wrecked are usually the one you can learn the most from. Watch those replay and think about what you did and what you could have done.Keep a notebook to take note of any information you think is valuable. Any useful information that you might forget should go in your notebook. You could also make a spreadsheet to keep track on your character win rate as the game dont track that.. Dont be afraid to lose. You dont become better by winning games. Winrate are a tool to track progression not a tool to tell people how good you are right now. Do not care about if you win or lose care about learning and improving and you will have a lot more fun.You practice session should try to incorporate every step. Do research on one move. Practice that move then go and play some game and try to incorporate the move in a real match. Then watch the replay to see what you did wrong and take note of it in your notepad.Here is the spread sheet I made if anybody want to use it.This method is valid for every game in every genre.,CrazyHand,clncl42,10,t5_33vle

2358772,0,t3_2mdcuv,Ive never kept track of exact uses left on tomes but Ive always kept an estimate of what I have left which you should do as well. You should NOT always ArcfiregtCharge Thunder. I generally start charging Thunder as soon as the match begins because in the splitsecond that usually follows the GO! you can shield or roll most anything coming at you. Arcfire is used as a mindgame and an attack. Dont forget that you can use it in the air and it combos into USair or FSair. DSmash is nice. But not always optimal as it lowers your Levin swords durability. Try this If they Dash attack and end up in front of you shieldgtFtilt or Dtilt. It knocks them away nicely and helps out with spacing. Behind you Ftilt. Dsmash should be used against predictable opponents for punishes and as a finisher at high percents. Use Elwind to attack below you on stage rarely. It leaves you helpless and one use lower. If they camp below you to use USmash or something maybe. But DSair and BSair are pretty powerful and have good range so think about that. Nosferatu can be be used out of Arcfire with a shorthopjump or close rang on the ground. Its mainly used for punishing laggy moves such as Falcons SideB and DownB. Heres a neat thing I do. ArcfiregtFSair then use my second jump to back away charging Thunder as I descend.Be trickysmart about charging Thunder and making them approach. Same goes for approaching. Trying to approach a Spammy Samus? ShorthopgtArcfiregtPunish. Not really helpful unless I can see the exact situation but Im sure you understand. People seem VERY afraid of getting hit so dont forget to fake them out every now and then. Also notice things. If they stay stationary while blocking Arcfire run up and grabgtDthrowgtUSairNote Be careful on people with Dairs like Tlink and Greninja as well as Megaman.,CrazyHand,cm396iv,6,t5_33vle

2507735,0,t3_2ocff2,Ganondorf main here! Channel your inner short hop hop and hop and hop till you can hop no more. Also power shield deflect the projectiles with ganondorfs aura of manliness made manifest when you shield. In addition you can down b most projectiles that arent overtly charged so if your about to get hit by a yoshi egg kick it getting arrows shot at you? kick it.this also works in mid air so if your about to get stun gunned by a zero suit samus down b into it. Now all of this said i think down b is the weakest way to get rid of projectiles.one thing many ganon mains dont recognize is a lot of our attacks have super armor. In fear of getting something wrong I wont list them off now but rest assure you can punch quite a few attacks coming at you.On to the most effective technique go to the other end of the stage and hang on that ledge. If the enemy persists on being a projectile spamming prick then you continue to be a ledge hobo. honestly ganon can get back on the ledge fairly easily if he falls and if you just press the back key on your circlepad every  or  seconds and get back on you basically latch straight back on without falling. Now if they start spamming projectiles near the edge think mega man charged forward smash which can hit below the ledge as they charge double jump up and down kick them where the sun dont shine it ll make them go flying and put you on the offence.the final point I have is ganon is a character deeply rooted in patience. you must have patience if you want to start curb stomping them. As soon as you can predict each and every shot from an opponent they will be forced to go on the offensive. If it goes to sudden death even your jab kills as does a down b so you will be on the advantage there.,CrazyHand,cmlwdp9,4,t5_33vle

2899747,0,t3_2sr0ns,Popping in Nairs catches everyone off guard because it is pretty much instant and when you do it right before you land they dont often see it coming. Pop a Nair immediately after jumpingshort hopping when approaching your opponent is pretty safe and they usually expect a dash or a grab. Jump around a lot but with your back to your opponent also can help with the mind games because your bair will be so present. Dont always toss out fludd it is great but like everything else in this game the more options you use the less your opponent will be able to read you. A great way to apply pressure off stage is to run off the side followed immediately by reversing a cape at the stage to grab the ledge you should hardly see the cape animation when you have the timing right. It is a really great way to put yourself in a good position to set up a wall of Bairs. Drop bair hop bair bair upB to get to the ledge again. Jump bair bair bair jump bair up B. Drop off Nair jump upB. Drop Fair jump upB this one is probably the toughest to recover from and probably wouldnt do it in game but it is doable. If you dropjump and use the left stick to control your positioning and the C stick to toss out the bairs you get even more options. If your opponent is already on the ledge and not quick enough you can use this reverse cape off the stage to pop them off the ledge and depending on how they respond you can get some attack options there. You really have to spend some time to practice the off stage stuff in training i recommend using the fixed camera mode because you will kill yourself A LOT learning your options. That is a lot more fun when you have unlimited lives and not constantly being interrupted by a pesky opponent. If you have a friend who is willing to let you practice the off stage game even better but kicking in to thin air gives you a pretty good idea of what Mario is capable of out there Good players will often be very appreciative of the off stage play  as measured in squats because  of players wont even approach off stage attacks but once you start they are high risk but make you a total badass for being willing to put yourself out there.

Once theyre up to high damage link will use his fsmash or usmash or i will rest on them. The advantage to having jiggs  link is if I miss a rest link has longer range attacks to keep people from punishing me. This also lets me go for more rests if we are behind a stock.

3289881,0,t1_cp33d9s,gtgood projectilesehh...gtrange on his attacksEHHHHHHHHHH......The range one mostly. One of Nesss major weaknesses is that his range is meh compared to other characters. Yeah he has  projectiles but... yeah. Its not like you expect projectiles to have no range ... PK Fire hah Arcfire explodes on the ground so its way different from Nesss PKF which only produces that multihit fire when it hits a hurtbox.PK Fire isnt to be spammed because its crazy laggy and punishable. Theres minimal SDI in this game which helps. Despite that opponents still get out of it fairly quickly though.PK Thunder is his best projectile. Its controllable tail has transcendent priority and it goes on for a long distance and time. Of course though it also shouldnt be spammed because it leaves Ness vulnerable. Its crazy good when you get the opponent to a high percentage and theyre far away and they havent died.dthrow to fair isnt  abusable anymore people are starting to know how to DI out now. DESPITE THISNess has a great combo game nonetheless and to make up for his lack of range he has pretty nice damage and knockback on his moves. Also bthrow is life.

Ness has a bunch of tools to keep good spacing between his opponent and if you kept that Mii Brawler off you with some good spacing you wouldnt have been beaten down as badly because Brawler isnt a great character and relies heavily on hisher opponent to screw up so they can punish.

You were not really on topic and simply ignoring useful resources because you refuse to ignore the triviality of the characters gender. And theyre most likely correct in using female pronouns anyway but more about that later.. You ignored or terribly misused accurate information. When people provided you with facts you simply rejected them as false or used troll logic rather unsuccessfully to try to twist words to fit your arguments.. Your claims and arguments did not hold up at all. To make this clearer Jigglypuff in the newest Pokemon games is  times as likely to be female as male. That alone suggests Jigglypuff is a she. Furthermore your main argument seems to be Jigglypuff is crossdressing. In the event that a person cannot express their gender otherwise it is typically considered politerespectful to assume they are the gender which they present themself as. In this case Jigglypuffs only means of conveying gender is through clothing and she always chooses feminine articles. In this case female clothing   female pronoun whether you like it or not.Please be more respectful to the community here.

4053088,0,t3_36ypyg,MK is very punish based. He aims to get the most out of every punish even though he doesnt get many opportunities to punish because of his weaker neutral game. In the words of Axe from the MVG stream MK just grabs you and goes swish swish swish with the sword and then youre dead.PPMD uses mind games and a strong ability to adapt in neutral to allow him to get many smaller punishes out of neutral better than anyone else. Hes also a big fan of the philosophy of being aggressive without swinging the sword. He rarely commits out of neutral and applies pressure through a powerful dashdance.Kens style is very mental based. He has the old school mentality of getting the forward smash and using every move in the characters kit even if its suboptimal. He does well because no one knows how to handle his jank as well as his incredible ability to know how the opponent will act and react. If the opponent is in shield he knows an Fsmash will connect because the opponent will jump out of shield at this very moment. Same with his tech chases. He rarely seems to completely react and just has a great game sense and knows how the opponent will tech. This leads to a lot of suboptimization when hes wrong however.,CrazyHand,cria7ek,18,t5_33vle

4105435,0,t3_37nco6,  Toon Link is a quick though relatively light character who is capable of spacing his attacks or fighting at closerange.You may generally use his aerial attacks to gain some space to breathHis Neutral air swipes his blade on both sides.This attack is good since it combos very easily and gives you the option to pull back and zone your opponent or to stay close and rack some damage that way.His forward air has a ton of startup lag and is landable in a handful of situations. While it may not be an attack you want to freely use it has a TON of KO power and can generally be used to end combos. You can go pretty far off the stage to use this attack since it has little ending lag.His Back air is the exact opposite of his forward air Nearly no Startup lag and a lot of ending lag. It doesnt quite have as much KO potential as his Forward air but still has a decent amount. This attack is good with pivot jumping and Breversals since it makes for good mindgames.His Up air is a great KO option near the top of the stage because of its power and since the hitbox stays out for an extended period of time it is very difficult to spotdodge or generally get around since you keep most of your mobility. However since you cant cancel the attack using it near the bottom of the stage may cost you a stock.This attack is probably his most risky. The down air spike for a little while in the beginning then outright launches anyone who comes into contact with the blade. The reason its so dangerous is because Toon Link launches down at a very fast speed when this attack is activated. And unlike the last installment hitting with this attack doesnt slow the attack. There are very few situations where spiking with this attack is plausible especially given its lack of reliabilityEither you can lead with at least a single stock which allows a second chance if it is missed or you can position yourself above a platform and depending on how the opponent is moving they may fly past the ledge and off to their doom.Also make sure there damage is considerably high like  or so otherwise you may have sacrificed a stock for a much lesser worth of damage.This attack is also useful for recovering from high places safely depending on character weight since this attack has a fairly decent sized windbox upon landing.His Air grab is good for light hits and setting boundaries since generally speaking people will avoid this attack. If pressing the grab button instead of ShieldAttack this can land into any attackpreferably one with little to no startup lag.Now that those are out of the way lets talk about grounded attacks.His ground game is better than his air game mainly because these are the moves that carry a combo through the middle as well as the fact that most of them jablock.His jabs are pretty good. They arent really used for carrying combos but the third hit can give you space while the first two can give you options. As an example you can Zair into jab if the first attack didnt yield the space you desired.Forward tilt gives possibly the most space for so little lag. The only downfall is that there still is some lag so if there damage is too low they shield or you outright miss you may be heavily punished. So damage them relative to there size before attempting to zone them with this.His up tilt juggles at low percentages and can actually combo into up Smash or up air after a juggle or after a strike or two. Its okay for antiair but with his neutral air you probably wont be using this attack too much.This attack isnt good for too much as it is basically a slightly changed side tilt. It has less end lag yet it also has less range. Unlike Side tilt however this one has a chance to trip as opposed to jablocking. It doesnt have too many uses however since combos usually do not involve this attack.His Forward Smash is actually two attacks as you initiate the attack then tap the attack button again. The first attack is very weak as far as knockback goes however it usually places the other person right within range of the second strike which has extreme knockback making it useful at even . However due to both staling and predictability it should not be loosely thrown around. The only reasons stopping after the first attack would be useful is for mindgames and in case of a floaty character.Up Smash is a convenient version of Forward Smash It has a much more fixed kill percentage due to its launch angle it comes out much quicker without the requirement of a starting attack and is much easier to combo into.This attack sweeps in front and then behind Toon Link. It should be generally used to gain some breathing space as everyone caught in the attack will be launched behind the character but it has very little yet some KO power.His special moves all have the same basic ability zoning the opponent.This attack is generally the one to use to switch in between close and long range. If you were to for example end a combo with this it would throw the opponent at a decent range and if grounded deal a fairly large amount of damage along the way. If in air it will only hit in the direction Toon Link is facing. This an be easily decided using breversals or leaving it as is.Arrows will most likely be item of choice when spacing especially since landing after use removes nearly all landing AND ending lag.They can be charged to the point of flying in a near straight line making it for certain characters to crouch under or you an charge it just enough to land on a crouching character though dealing less damage due to less charge.The Boomerang is the most useful spacing options since it can be angled up straight or down. In combination with arrows it can be a great aggressive tool especially against large characters like Bowser and Ganondorf. The only downfall is the increased startup lag.The Bombs are useful for maintaining your space since it causes a decent amount of hitstun. It sadly doesnt have much range however so jumping may be a necessity. With jump cancel it can easily combo into closerange effectively making it the reverse version of the hero spin.His grabs are decent with the exception of back throw which has extreme KO power near the edge of the stage his jab is pretty fast though it deals about  and he can wall jump.OVERVIEWToon Link is a relatively fast yet light character who relies heavily on his ability to both combo and zone his opponents while effectively switching play styles constantly and respectively to each matchup.,CrazyHand,cro8swx,4,t5_33vle

4239774,0,t3_39h463,probably my favorite setup is the two hit jab if they DI into or away from you if you wavedash forward at  you can just let loose the punch before they hit the ground as well as forward smash if you dont have one charged.  Cargo up throw to giant punch on fast fallers is a true combo while cargo forward throw works for most everyone else. also a fun thing to do is Breverse it after a string of back airs.  Remember as well that if you connect a hit on the hitboxes behind DK it will send them directly upwards which almost always results in a kill fully charged.Also Breversing your headbutt if you read a roll is a really nice mixup that can usually bury them and get a punch off.,CrazyHand,cs3iy6w,1,t5_33vle

4417882,0,t1_csn4qp6,Hey dude. I play LinkIkeLucas Likus if you will so Ive got a few tips for you to build off of what the guy above has provided all of which is GREAT information by the way. First of all I must agree wholeheartedly that your life will be made better by using more PKfire. Dont worry about being that guy youve only got so many moves to work with and if one of them is damn good then you should use it  and damn good is an understatement for PKFire. You should spend some time mastering the shorthop PKFire for retreating and approaching and breversing the attack so your opponent gets confused with your momentum. Here is a really good guide to b reversing if you havent seen it already. Using this technique you can space better than like  of the roster.I see you making good use of zair but I think you should work on converting off of those hits through shorthopping zair. Its great for approaches. Your hops can also be a little closer to the ground it seemed like when you were approaching you did almost a full hop toward your opponent. With SHzair you have not much knockback negligible landing lag if it hits and you can oftentimes start strings out of it if your foe is caught off guard. Im a big fan of zairgtdtiltgtnair which as you know you can string into another nair most of the time. Lets talk about your edge game. As the dude above mentioned Lucas has the potential to edgeguard pretty hard and you should take advantage of that. One thing to note about the dsmash is that with the three blasts the hitbox lingers for like  of a second which is HUGE. Work on your timing so that your opponent is one frame away from grabbing the ledge during that  of a second. It takes some getting used to but try to get a feel for the timing on the second and third blast of the dsmash. Most of the time I dont even bother charging it the knockback is ridiculous. You mentioned that youre getting punished for whiffing there is very little endlag on this move if it whiffs however there is a LOT if you hit on shield so this means you should be launching your smash EARLIER than you have been. Remember to put the lingering hitbox to use  seriously this move is beastly. Also if they start getting used to you hunting for it bait the getup rolljump and throw out that upsmash one rolls length away from the ledge. Lingering hitbox ungodly damageknockback. With rage I killed a Mewtwo at like  yesterday with this same trap. As mentioned above if theyre out of shield and within jab range youll pull them into the hitbox.PK Thunder is also an excellent edgeguarding move and it keeps the pressure on your opponent big time. Chase them off stage with the pk thunder! If you get behind them right before they grab the ledge make sure youre center stage of course trace along the ledge to try and stagespike them if the map allows. I suspect you know this already because I saw you fishing for it a couple times against peach but bair spikes if you hit it at the right angle. The last large hitbox like behind Lucas knee is the one you have to nail them with. In your match against Marth you hit too early a few times which is easy to do and the problem I have with the move most of the time. Bair also has almost zero landing lag so this is a good walling move once you can start flicking it out on shorthops. One overall suggestion I have for you is to stay on the move a bit more. Obviously you cant and shouldnt always be moving but you fell into a few predictable patterns every time your match reset to the neutral game shield if theyre approaching zair if you want to approach jab if you catch them out of shield. Do some dash dancing keep them confused as to whether youre attacking or defending pivots breversed PKFires zairtonair are all great options. Hell even throwing out a PK Freeze when youve got some space is great to get into someones head and also forces their hand if they are offstage.Heres some crazy shit that probably shouldnt be used but its super fun and sometimes makes cool things happen. When recovering if I know an opponent is gonna chase me offstage for a spike or gimp Ill use the Psimagnet to reverse Lucas in midair to try and get them with the bair spike. Obviously only works in specific situations Marth is particularly susceptible to this have also found Dorf to be an easy one but if all goes according to plan you can bair spike them then PKThunder back to safety.If you PKThunder yourself into a wall you can use PKThunder again if you do it very quickly. Only works if Lucas bounces off the wall. I dont know if I saw you doing this or not but its a fun technique.I really liked your use of uptilt I dont use that move enough. It also true combos from dtilt so lets both put that to better use! D,CrazyHand,csnmot6,1,t5_33vle
4420672,0,t3_3bnr19,I would say that you have the right idea with playing without rolls for a few games just dont do it against other people. Start with a level of AI that you feel comfortable with and play a few games without rolls up the level of the AI and practice without rolls then play against friends perhaps giving yourself permission to roll at this point or not. I think either way will help you reduce it. That said you might play a character who is a safe roller like Lucario or Little Mac.

4546779,0,t1_ct3p8vn,The blast zone on every stage is a box. A giant box. Do die you must leave this box. Sounds simple. The most effecient way to get out of the box is simple. You need to travel perpendicular towards the nearest edge of the blast zone. When you are killing your opponent this is your goal. Although DIing will not decrease knockback you can DI in such a way that a larger distance must be traved to get out of the blast zone. How does one accomplish this? Well if the smallest distance between a point and a line is by going at a  angle then increasing or decreasing this angle will increase the amount of knockback required. So just DI any direction? Not exactly. Since we are dealing with a box and not a single line we need to DI toward a perfect spot where it is farthest from any relevant blast zone. This magical spot is the corner. It sounds simple and it is. People put DI on a pedistol and make it seem like a revelutionary tech but its just basic reasoning. So now you know. When you DI point the stick so that the angle of your stick and the angle of your launch average out to the angle towards the corner youre going toward.,CrazyHand,ct3qwg2,2,t5_33vle

And your timing and spacing on these seems to get you punished. ROBs hurtbox on his aerials is too far removed from Warios hitboxes so if you clash ROB seems to win out in most instances.I took the liberty of watching an Abadango as Wario versus ROB match and I saw that Abadango initially struggled with the same issues you do What actually seemed to work better for him was to approach on foot and shield or power shield ROBs projectiles.

4992862,0,t3_3j9h3q,Dashcanceling with shield While you stop immediately you tend to use it as an approach option which it can be. Though in the footage provided you use it too often and allowed you to be grabbed and fast players will pick up on it and punish you quickly for having shield open often.Edgeguard In my opinion holding shield can be a very bad option. When your opponent was offstage early into the match you shielded by the ledge because you started to anticipate a b recovery. Later into the match you attempted to go for a bair stage spike with Villager having a crazy recovery it was very easy for her to get back on stage and avoid you. Shielding Combined with above there was a lot of unnecessary shielding to run back and forth. Foxtrotting would have been better as you can act out quickly. Try and utilize outofshield options especially with jump cancels.Approaching Kirby has really bad approaches. Grabs dairs and nairs are good for setting up strings. However they leave Kirby idle for quite a bit and faster fighters will be ready to punish. Fair can help him space and can follow up his aerial movement should keep him safe along with proper spacing. Dtilt is also good of course just be prepared for the trip. You must use nairs and dairs sparingly being too aggressive sets you up for a easy shield  punish.TLDR Find the balance between defensive and offensive. Know how much your shield will actually bring benefits know when to back off. ,CrazyHand,cuntr4w,1,t5_33vle

5017561,0,t1_cuqles4,Dont think about where your opponent is but rather where hes going.This.  The flaw in spam is that it is predictable.  The way to beat spam and get better in general is to be unpredictable.  Dont always rush your opponent down. Taking a few percent here and there from arrowsboomerangs is no big deal compared to walking into a charged fsmash on a flubbed approach.  Like others have said work on powershielding.  Even if you have crappy reaction time like me that should allow you to block a good portion of the projectiles.  Then you have the option to try to either advance slowly or outcamp Link as an Ike main I only wish that was an option for me....  Just mix things up jump around a lot shield frequently throw projectiles dash and stop etc.  If you try to approach approach several different ways and sometimes fake the approach.  Bait out attacks and punish any openings you see like the endlag of smash attacks or arrow shots.It sounds like you have managed some baiting and punishing already which is great.  The next step is just to stay unpredictable.  Once you show them there is a way you can camp approach or chase them you can bet they will try to bait you into repeating your attack so they can punish you and get back to spamming.  But so long as you dont get predictable yourself you can bait those punishes out too and hit them in return.  Dont repeat a pattern more than a couple times before switching it up.  ,CrazyHand,cuqt1zh,1,t5_33vle
5023106,0,t3_3jqffv,Grabgtdown throwgtup smash is a great combo. Dont forget your counter. Its nowhere close to the best in the game but at least its there. NA and UA are pretty good for racking up damage. Up tilt is more amazing than you think. Really her tilts in general are pretty great. Forward smash either kills or blows the opponent. For me Im throwing side special Reflect cards all the time. Opponents have to run through them and thrown off stage can simply deny ledge grabs. I once threw one out with Villager above me trying to throw a bowling ball. The ball bounced on the TOP of the reflect card and OKed Villager. I dont ever use Neutral special. It takes too long and almost never hits. Watch the grab whiff too. The end lag is dangerous. And dont pummel until theyre in roughly s. ,CrazyHand,curh4t8,2,t5_33vle

I needed to slow it down to just get my hands to do it and after that first session I never did it again.I play music and I learned from an old teacher of mine to start every practice with slow notes just letting them ring out. It was always easier for me to practice a fast part slowly then increase speed until I can master the timing.

Giving it a visual effect akin to a stutter stepDance Trotting  Also heard this called Extended Dash Dancing is similar to fox trotting in terms of execution but it gives an effect similar to dash dancing in melee. To perform the DT practice the fox trotting timing on your characters and learn that characters specific timing.

5187409,0,t3_3m17m1,Oh yeah! Another pikachu main.  I wrote a sorta kinda guide on him a while back. Lemme copy and paste it.Edit heres my sorta kinda guide thingySo so sorry. Got caught up in work and junk.Quick attack is one of the best neutral game tools in smash . Its hard to punish it has a really long range and its a combo starter. The first thing youre gonna want to do before you actually play with him though is just getting used to quick attack. Go into training mode pick battlefield and just get used to how quick attack feels. The way it works is that you can do  quick dashes but they have to be in different directions each time. So basically you cant go straight up twice but you can go up once and diagonally up the second time.Get used to doing two quick attacks on the ground. First practice going forward to back then back to forward then practice forward to forward. The way you do forward to forward is you quick attack straight ahead the first time then do diagonally towards the floor in the same direction. The second zip will be shorter because youre going diagonally. Once you get those down practice short hopping and as soon as you leave the ground quick attack in a direction. That is slower than just quick attacking from the ground but give you a little bit of room to work off of.After you get that down look of esams guide to quick attack cancelling. He could explain it waaaaay better than I ever could.And to play pika but almost always want to be aggresive not giving the opponent space to calculate their moves or collect themselves. Now you dont have to apply pressure by physically being there. This is where thunder jolt comes into play. You can be far away from a player but still apply pressure by spamming thunder jolts. Those tjolts will just be a nuisance but theyll constantly have to worry about them which will add to their plate.The two main ways you want to approach by are short hop aerials and quick attack. The two mains aerials you will want to do are fair and dair. If you use short hop fair and they shield you can back away while still in the air and they wont punish you making it good safe pressure. The short hop dair is harder to do. What you have to do is short hop and literally as soon as you short hop input dair. DO NOT I repeat DO NOT fastfall. If you do the short hop dair correctly it will autocancel as soon as you hit the ground allowing you to follow up with anything. If you do it wrong however or fastfall you will get that extreme landing lag that you usually get on dair. Short hop dair is mostly safe on shield and is a great mixup.Another thing youll need to figure out is grab combos. Your main grab tool is dthrow as you can do the bread and butter combo dthrow  uair  nairbair which always does a nice  damage. At low percents you can also fthrow which also lets you get a guaranteed dash attack or if they miss a tech you can go for a jab lock using your neutral jab.The biggest weakness about pika is that he has a helluva hard time killing people. He has no grab setups his aerials basically never kill and his smash attacks generally require hard reads. This is where your edgeguarding comes in. Since pikas recovery is godlike you can do basically whatever you want offstage. Also look at my edgeguarding guide through my comment history since I just wrote one.For guides go on the pikachu smashboards forums. They help a lot if youre new. Also look up gameplay from ESAM and kenny. Both are amazing pikachus except that kenny SDs a lot haha.Also glad to see more pikachu mains. A lot of people dont want to play him because hes not a braindead character like some of the other top tiers cough cough luigi cough coughAlso I forgot theres some bad MUs you need to prepare for. Luigi is our biggest enemy. His fireball beats our tjolt at close range he converts off of grabs way better than we do his nair stops us from juggling him and his tornado makes it hard to edgeguard him. While I do suggest just picking a secondary character to fight him luigi does bad against spacing and zoning characters aka rob or megaman. I chose wii fit trainer because I like her I have figured out a way to fight him with some effectiveness. Try to get him offstage as much as you can and then fair him as far away from the stage as you can. He will inevitably come bad because of the luigi missile but you just want to do as much damage as possible. Now when he is under the stage and about to recover use nair. It beats out the tornado and trades with is upb so you have hopefully gimp him. Onstage basically dont challenge him. As boring as it may be play really defensively by spamming tjolts and using quick attack to get small combos and then running away again.Edit forgot about u throw  thunder,CrazyHand,cvb9u0j,3,t5_33vle
5195850,0,t3_3m5zio,I have experienced this as well. It seems the later I go to For Glory the better the matches tend to be. I also have the weird benefit of being matched with Japanese players nearly as often as American ones due to my location and I find I get matched up with them even more often later at night. This makes sense as that is the time its generally daytime there! Afternoons seem to be when I get matched with the more obnoxious types or simply newer players which getting the latter isnt always bad. Its odd to be sure especially when you mix in the various timezones. Then again Ive heard that Nintendo has no matchmaking system for Smash and sometimes that they do but oh wait no one is ever sure so who knows?  I would be interested to know if there is some kind of matchmaking system in place.

5236202,0,t3_3mq7sb,Not sure if this is DS or WiiU...But if its WiiU try buying a wired LAN Adapter first. This bypasses the issue of a poor wireless router since it plugs into the modem. Heres an example from Nintendos store website but obviously you can get it for cheaper if you search on Amazon. Youll need an Ethernet cable that can reach from your WiiU to your modem. For most its a cheaper solution than investing in a new router so its a good first step if your only goal is to improve the online experience and the issue is the wireless router. The issue could also be that there are others in the household that are sucking up bandwidth. Or the opponent is the one with crappy internet. If its the DS then its up in the air. From my experience changing the router doesnt affect much unless its dropping the signal. You could go for one with QoS Quality of Service options to limit bandwidth of other devices or to prioritize the bandwidth for the DS.,CrazyHand,cvh5i15,1,t5_33vle

Downtilt comes out on frame  which means that it could lead into some grab setups as well as making Lucass grab generally a lot better overall.You have to learn how to space your PK Fires as well since PK Fire is a very VERY important tool for Lucas.Most of your aerials are pretty good at comboing into one another so practice messing around with some aerial combos and see what works honestly.Practice your spikes as well  Lucas has a TON of killing options.Off the top of my head he has a bair spike a dair spike PK Fire can kill off the side lmao downthrow to upair upthrow at high and finally the sickest one of all  A HARD UPSMASH READ.If you want a notable player to study SpaceDong is a Lucas secondary as he mains Fox but you can find VODs of his most recent monthly at twitch.tvegeofficial and somewhere on YouTube Im unaware of because I never really checked lololololYou can also follow him at twitter.comSpaceDong if you ever want better advice than I could give you honestly.Hope this helped you regardless and enjoy playing Lucas nice to see him getting more love D,CrazyHand,cwb2zki,0,t5_33vle

5754617,0,t1_cxac5ux,Thank you for the thorough response! I agree that my fundamentals are very lacking. The only improvement I have seen over past few years seems to be that I spam shorthop arials instead of smash attacks and rolls. I am mostly frustrated because I dont know how to improve my fundamentals. The only advice I ever get about fundamentals is to play more but I play a lot and I dont really feel like it is always very quality play time. Im not sure how to play so that I can really learn instead of just autopiloting and making the same mistakes. Learning things like better grab followups using bair instead nair and using tilts instead of jabs are all good pieces of advice but I am losing so badly that I dont really think any of those things would be gamechanging I think the real improvement I need to make is thinking faster and being more aware which I am very bad at. For example I played against my friends Lucario and I was hit by at least  or  fully charged aura spheres throughout the match. I knew that I had a reflector but I only reacted fast enough to reflect  in the whole match. It was very frustrating I feel like my mind is just too slow for this game sometimes. In that situation I knew exactly what to do when to do it and it was an almost stupidly simple execution. I literally could not have been handed an easier example of a situation to punish his attack and I was unable to. I had like  full seconds to react as the projectile approached me and my reflector even works in midair I was just that slow. So when I watch high level matches and read discussion boards about my character I have a very hard time applying any of the knowledge I gain because of how slow my mind reacts ingame. ,CrazyHand,cxaeyci,1,t5_33vle

6364077,0,t3_4263si,Yoshis sideb eggroll is one of the most underrated moves in the game IMO. Yes at the highest level of competitive play it has very little use but it does still have its uses. First of all keep in mind that it is a highriskhighreward option. If you catch an opponent in it ideally at low percents w heavy or slowfallers  and move back and forth as fast as possble basically staying in one place  it generally combos into itself. Which nets an easy  any time you DO manage to catch people in it.Secondly also keep in mind that this move eats up shields pretty well. It does a fair amount of shield damage compared to most of Yoshis moveset. If your opponent is at a midlevel or even mediumhighlevel shield it can actually BREAK their shields if youre relentless enough and the opponent doesnt drop shield. More likely though the best way youll find to use this move on shield is to allow it to weaken the opponents shield enough to make them wary of using it or allowing for shieldpokes or  best of all  allowing yourself to break their shield with a Yoshibomb downb one of my favorite ways to KO opponents. While yoshibomb cant usually destroy a shield on its own with even one hit of shielddamage from egg roll most opponents shields will be weakened enough to be destroyed by one Yoshibomb. Its beautiful.Anyway here are a few more specific ways to catch people in it even at higher levels of play. And there are other techniques too so I suggest anyone reading this experiments with it as much as they can. That said here you go Using it to catch rollers. Anyone who overabuses rolls which I understand does not happen at higher levels but it can still occasionally be useful in this way is going to be absolutely destroyed by this move. The lingering hitbox high priority in many situations and sheer duration of move make this one of the most ideal rollcatching moves in the entire game IMO. It annihilates socalled For Glory Links as well as any person that chooses to do nothing but roll around and use the cstick etc. If nothing else its a good move for ending shitty FG matches as quickly as possible.But yeah so say an opponent has a habit of rolling after whiffedmoves especially ones with high cooldown. Rather than punishing it ASAP as theyd expect with whatever safe move  mix it up and use the egg roll which most of the time will catch their reflexroll or any types of rolls really. The extra startup on the eggroll also helps if they happen to spotdodge or something. Catching people landingThis is one of the best ways to use it IMO. If you see an opponent whos about to land without their jump left eggroll will catch them the majority of the time no matter if they tech airdodge into the ground or autocancel with a move. The extended hitbox duration of move combined with the opponents limited landingoptions makes this move surprisingly useful in this situation. Obviously top players can find certain ways to prevent this from working but youd be surprised how well it can still work even against these top players much of the time. Mixing up landingsjumping over stuffWhen you use the eggroll in the air Yoshi hovers in the egg for about half a second as the move starts up. This can slow your fall just enough to dodge an opponent trying to punish your landing while simultaneously putting you in an ideal situation to immediately punish their own whiffed punish. You can even use this technique to hop over lowhanging projectiles such as mario amp luigis fireballs ZSSs lasers various megaman moves and more. This situation can of course have varying usefullness depending on how laggy your opponents moves are how far away they are their reactiontime and how they react in general. That said when you time it just right it can be quite amazing.You can also use this move to jump over low projectiles and certain characters if you get good at making the egg jump and the timing and everything. This can also be a surprisingly useful way to escapemixup certain situations.In conclusion these are just a few main uses of the move that I find helpful even against fairly good players on Anthers or FG. In general the move can also be useful as a general mixup and a way to escapereset neutraljump off the edge real quick and then jump back as another user in this thread said.Hope you find this useful.,CrazyHand,czd0x4n,2,t5_33vle

After some research I learned that there were whole other levels of depth and intricacy that I never knew existed. I never would have improved if I didnt learn about techniques and force myself to implement them into my play. Im by no means a pro now but Im certainly much better than I was back then during the Brawl days.I dont know how advanced you are but if youre having trouble against even average opponents my guess is that you are at the place where I was back then. If so I recommend picking up a character that forces you to learn spacing and other basic techniques someone like Marth. His endlag is decent on a lot of his moves which will force you to not throw out attacks willynilly. And he really rewards players for keeping the proper distance from the opponent which is a big part of Smash . Corrin is also heavily based on spacing options.Good luck and dont feel discouraged! Like other people have said everyone else has been playing this game for over a year now so the online community is much better than it was back when Smash  was just released. You probably still have some catching up to do.,CrazyHand,d00wwlj,1,t5_33vle

Fast Ground or aerial moves Sadly none Shulks fastest ground move is his frame  jab which often is slower than other ground moves and bad for a jab. His fastest aerial is his frame  NAir this is quite slow which makes him easy to combo as he cannot break out of combos using a fast aerial like other characters can this makes him struggle against characters like Sheik and Fox. KO Throws Shulks BThrow is his strongest kill throw killing mid weights at  in Smash Art at the edge his DThrow is slightly weaker killing at  at the edge on mid weights.

Shulks BAir on frame  Shulks UAir on frame  and Shulks DAir on frame . This means Shulk is almost always forced into landing lag even after the animation shows he has put the Monado back onto his back. Shulks recovery Is fairly simple he has  mid air jump and a  hit recovery move called Air Slash it is good for vertical recovery but can easily be spikedstaged spiked when travelling upwards. The first hit of Air Slash does not snap to the ledge which means you have to sweet spot the ledge or risk getting punished going above it he has a predictable recovery that goes like jump gt Air Slash. The nd hit will auto grab the ledge. Although Shulks horizontal recovery is weak you can delay the nd hit of Air Slash to get a better horizontal recovery this is especially effective in speed and jump. Air Slash rises higher in jump which can be used to recover from lower down. Combos Shulk has very little true combos from his throws although you can follow up with back slash from back throw and up tilt from up throw Shulk also has a  from Up Throw in Jump Art using Monado Art Buffered Deactivation MABD at high percents you can Up Throw deactivate the Jump Art during the Up Thow and you will go higher allowing you to kill at high percents with Up Air or if you read an air dodge you can Up Air them later this can be true at certain percents. Unique Attributes Shulk has Monado Arts which are unique to him they allow a variety of Advanced Techniques like MALLC this cancels all landing lag if you land with an aerial at the same time as an Art activates. The activation of a Monado Art has  frames of invincibility this can be used to avoid a variety of attacks and grabs and to easily punish your opponent. Shulk can also B reverse or Wavebounce the Art activates this changes his momentum and his direction if you B reverse it rather than wavebounce this is really good for mixing up your approaches as you can do any move during your momentum changeafter it . Shulk also has Monado Art Buffered Deactivation MABD which allows you to get the effect of the Art you deactivate without the drawbacks. Shulk also has Monado Art Run Cancel MARC which cancels his run into a walk when an Art Activates basically allowing him to do anything from a run.

7028786,0,t3_4bwpur,I just watched the first one Im going to give it a whirl You need to become familiar with your moves.What does this mean? You need to know what move to use in certain situations. You started the match off by just dash attacking and up smashing. This is bad because both of those moves are very unsafe on shield and you are playing against a character that wants to shield grab your unsafe approach. Off each grab he gets a follow up and he has a kill confirm off it! Be more patient and scout out his habits you dont have to commit with every approach. Learn the spacing for your moves as well very important. If you were more familiar with your moves youd find out upthrowing that DK and juggling him with your upair would have been very effective. DK has trouble landing and you could have preyed on that.  Option selectionBecause you threw out these moves this is what you told your opponent Hold shield and then grab me. You mix this up with grabs and safe shield pressure. Try spacing your back air on his shield whilst retreating. Your own grab has followups but you didnt make him afraid of it so he had no reason to not hold shield vs you. Think rockspapersscissors Grab beats Shield which beats Attack which beats Grab.   Off stage linear recovery lifeFalcos recovery is very linear this means when youre traveling directly upward other characters will try to stage spike you. Because you cant stop them if they time it right your option is to learn how to tech the wall. You practice this on the stage called  I believe  Temple. Go to the spike near the bottom of the stage and run into it over and over. When you get to  start trying to hit one of your trigger buttons RIGHT BEFORE hitting the wall. If done correctly you will stick to the wall for a bit and not fly off.  Punish gameYou should save your smashes for killing or punishing heavily unsafe moves. Falco has a fantastic upsmash right now because of the buffs its one of the fastest in the game! But thats not a good enough reason to use it in the neutral. You might say Why not its fast and strong so Ill get a lot of damage! The reason is twofold First if they shield your upsmash you are very open as Falco as it is laggy and you are at a nice weight  fall speed for combing. Secondly by going for an uptilt you could have setup your own combo with a faster and less punishable move. Because DK is heavy you could have strung multiple uptilts and followed up with upairs for much more damage than a single upsmash had it hit.What you need is a training partner who can tell you what youre doing wrong.,CrazyHand,d1d2egm,3,t5_33vle
7076384,0,t1_d1i4pfr,gtEx I get told Im not applying enough pressure so I do short hop nairsfairs. But I still get blocked and hit so I try to play defensively. Then I get chargeshielded or dash grabbed. I am out played every step of the way.You need to change your whole mindset about what it means to mix up. A mix up isnt a technical tool. Its not a technique that you do in a specific situation. Its a psychological tool. Thats why asking how can I mix up in this situation? is a very weak question. We can tell you what tools you have and give you a general idea of when it wouldnt be a bad idea to use them but whether its a good idea to use a tool in a particular situation depends mostly on your opponent and how they think.Applying pressure is just as much about what you do as it is about when you do those things. Its not about simply throwing heaps of SH fairsnairs at your opponent  what would you do if your opponent was spamming SH fairsnairs? If you were decent youd blockavoid every one of them. If you were good youd bait them out and punish afterwards. If you were even better youd punish them so hardoften that your opponent becomes too scared to aggress you. This is exactly whats happening to you. Look up the concept of footsies in fighting games. Its hugely important here.Forgive me for peeking through your post history but I was curious to see who you playedgtShulk ZSS Falco Bayonetta and CloudAs far as options go ZSS and Cloud usually have plenty Bayonetta has a decent amount and Shulk is probably the least versatile but he at least has the Monado Arts which are great for mixing things up.,CrazyHand,d1ih088,1,t5_33vle

ROB has a lot of good antiapproach tools. You have to abuse the heck out of them in this matchup. Mix in grabs to deal with shielding and nairs to beat out jumps.

He didnt seem to be blocking too many of them but they are both extremely unsafeI think it usually isnt worth it to try to edgeguard Lucario especially once he has some aurarage built up. He can mix up how he recovers by changing time ledgepast ledge straight up on stage and with enough Aura getting hit by his up B will send you flyingusually wont kill but you give up stage controlIt would probably be better to just to let him snap and either go for the ledge trump or try to read his getup optionVery good platformstage sharking on the second set.,CrazyHand,d7k7872,1,t5_33vle

Word for word too. Just fair a couple times. Maybe Zair. Yeah hes used to shielding now so I can probably grab him.But in saying that I get a few things out of it. I know Im hitting his shield so I empty hop in between attacks to see if he does a counter attack. Also to see if he changes his defensive option. If he spot dodges or something Ill switch up what I do. I also now think about what Ill do to catch his landing since Im so confident that Ill grab him and execute my combo. Its obviously not always gonna be this simple and your thought process will be different than mine but having a go to voice helps.

Start with movement  of melee is making your character move exactly how you want them to. Once you practice enough to avoid an opponents attack you can counter attack very quickly. The xx cpu is no exception. If you carefully watch your first video the CPU will wait for you to wiff an attack or get trapped in a dash or shield and then go in when youre stuck. It is applying pressure via dash dancing and movement then once you swing and miss it goes in. As your movement gets better you should be able to outspace the cpu. Also practice tilts and grab tilt timing so practice fthrow dtilt and uthrow utilt. Other things to practice are zero percent fthrow fthrow and uthrow nair on spacies.Pay attention to your percents Uthrow regrab does not work on high percentages on spacies you have to Uthrow Utilt at mid to high percentages or uthrow uair.You need to develop a feel for the game watch some Marth videos and look at what the players do and why did they do it. Do they run away to avoid an attack then dash back in? Do they run in when the opponent is in lag? What percentages do their combos work at? Take some notes and practice specific combos at specific percents on a training mode ai where you can set the percents. From there you can practice on your friends and CPUs.Marth Playlist ,CrazyHand,dcpaw9k,1,t5_33vle
10545236,0,t3_5qyh3m,I find my fundamentals getting better by using a variety of characters instead of just one. Not only do I gain a better understanding of what options these characters have but I also have the opportunity to use them if they are really effective for a matchup.,CrazyHand,dd3f4yb,11,t5_33vle
10614176,0,t1_dd9lqbq,Do you happen to know which stages result in sudden death when Bowsercide happens? Id like to know when I can force it if necessary.,CrazyHand,ddarsbt,1,t5_33vle
10710682,0,t1_ddkptws,Exactly! When you let go of the stick your character starts to slide and you will only the able to shield once the slide is over. If you press shield while holding the stick it will at least almost come out as fast as when you are standing  walking EDIT I found a clip which demonstrates this perfectly. Its from the DS version but the same applies to WiiU ,CrazyHand,ddkq5st,6,t5_33vle
10812595,0,t3_5ume22,Just being able to establish a neutral and get those grabs that should be step one if you havent gotten that down yet.,CrazyHand,ddv8r79,5,t5_33vle
10869672,0,t3_5vba2l,Sheik can needle fidget out of a dash. So you can cancel needle charging into any of her grounded options. I dont know what the frame difference is but it always seems much quicker to me. Im pretty sure theres a video on it by deku tree.I know you mentioned using Diddy but I figured it could useful for any sheik players looking in this thread who dont already know about it.,CrazyHand,de14nw6,2,t5_33vle
10917754,0,t1_de5qkdf,Its hard for me to give a single thing to work on but Id probably give you  primary ones in this match up in no particular order recoveries that leave you less vulnerable harder punishes. Personally I recommend checking out Westballz for combos and creative movement Mango for mind games and laser usage.Hard to judge properly the quality of gameplay and mind games properly with sample size  but heres my take. Game  had better execution than game . Game  was pretty clean in that regard. Game  was not. Similarly your movement and neutral options were better in game . Game  you looked pretty good but in game  you started overusing shield. I do think more lasers when youre not threatened would help you though. Another thing to note is that it seems like you full hop more than you should since you should either be on the ground or short hopping for the majority of the match up until you get a combo going. You dont seem to overuse particular attacks which is good. Your combos in game  were better than in game . I am afraid I am not focused enough right now to properly analyze how well conditioning may have been applied.,CrazyHand,de6382i,1,t5_33vle
