1921894,0,t1_ckkr133,The course is sized for Americans and the Japanese have a hard time with it.  Shingo Yamamoto as much as I respect the guy is too old to really have a shot at it he doesnt do well in Japan either anymore.  The British guy also showed promise.  If the Europeans practice the course they could do it so the Americans need to step up because next year could see a champion.,ninjawarrior,ckkrw4g,6,t5_2s4st

4407819,0,t1_csmbfb5,Yeah we can hope. I think there are increasingly more and more ninjadojos cropping up worldwide obviously USA is way in the forefront which will help.Still as a UK person Id rather see a UK team join and fail than not have in its own time tho!,ninjawarrior,csmhv20,1,t5_2s4st

4804318,0,t3_3gnxq9,That depends so much. Are you only providing the gym? Are you providing group classes also? Are they part of the month pass? Extra? Extra but discounted? I would only sell day passes for nonmemberships and multiday discounted passes it would be a pain to keep track on when to kick someone out plus seriously how many people have the endurance to go  hours at an obstacle gym? Just sell day passes. I would pay  probably for a day pass. Do you already have a group of  people who are ready to sign up on day ? If no where are those people going to come from? How do you know there is interest in your area for the gym at all?For month passes it would depend so much. If you had just a couple obstacles and only open gym no classes I wouldnt give you more than mo if you had someone of Stage  in Vegas quality as one of your trainers and a top quality gym with a ton of training area I would give you possibly as much as mo. This is what I would pay in my area at least. Its also going to vary by region a lot what would be reasonable to pay.,ninjawarrior,cu04hd2,1,t5_2s4st
4831039,0,t1_cu3him7,Yes but because the course is different not the people.I think UK people are roughly as fit as people in the US so on a US course they would compete roughly the same. They might have a slightly lower success rate because of a lack of experience but I dont think it would be wildly out of proportion just a little.,ninjawarrior,cu3hqfp,1,t5_2s4st

ANW is supposed to be one of the few unique sports that promotes camaraderie and the competitors should all be rooting for each other to do the best they can. million dollars is still chump change to NBC considering all the money theyve squandered on failed TV dramas.,ninjawarrior,cv1yrdr,20,t5_2s4st

Hint she failed the rd obstacle in city finals last year Ill remind you that she was a wildcard in Vegas last year. Which means based on merit she did not make it farther than Kacy did.I understand that its all too easy to direct hate towards Kacy due to a variety of different reasons. Just remember that what you see on TV is the product of a manufactured narrative. You do not know her personally.,ninjawarrior,cvjnu5l,0,t5_2s4st

7776386,0,t3_4lpiyp,I really enjoyed this last night!  Heres what I keep thinking though...consider the skill challenge where they fly though the air trying to land on the target. Only a handful of people got to try any of the skills challenges...I just wonder how many OTHER people could have done just as well and maybe even better?!  Guess well never know.  I would really like to see more people get to try the skills challenge for a better sample of people that could do AND exceed what Drew and Isaac did.  They matched each other I just wonder how many others could have accomplished the feat if given the chance?!I kind of feel like YEAH!  What they did was AMAZING but they were just the most amazing out of like  people that got to try that skill.I would like to see a regular show that did this all the time where Ninjas could compete in the skill competitions and then take the best of the best and put them in an Ultimate Skills Competition at the end of the season to see who REALLY is the Best of the Best!  Its like putting  horses in the Kentucky Derby and saying the winner is the best of all the horses in the world...well...only  got to try it...there are probably some better horses out there they just didnt get to run!I bet ugeoffnotjeff could have flown through the air and grabbed onto those ledges with his superhuman forearms D,ninjawarrior,d3q41au,2,t5_2s4st
