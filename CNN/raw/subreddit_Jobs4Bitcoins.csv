As you know it takes an infinite amount of energy to take particle x and accelerate it to light speed.  HOWEVER tachyons are created travelling at light speed. if they exist Because of its speed it would appear to be everywhere along its path by the time it even registered. They get really interesting in that because time is essentially static to them they travel only in space. Meaning such concepts as deceleration are alien.
