I dont think any band sounds the exact same after that much time even if the band has had the same lineup for all that time and been taking topnotch care of themselves. Im just happy its happening and if people dont like it then they dont have to go to the shows.I did put solos for Axl Slash and Duff in there already. Again if Richard Fortus is playing rhythm he might pull out a solo.

All we can do is site the reasons he reportedly quit in  Hes clean sober doesnt seem to need the money doesnt like being dictated too amp enjoys playing clubs amp theaters more than arenas amp stadiums. He just wants to write amp play music in a Rock band.Did you see any of the videos Izzy tweeted in the past couple months?

I did read a interview with Mick Wall about how Axl called him to come over to him place at am to do a interview to call out Vince Neil and to tell him that hes gonna kick his ass and what not.... Just before he was going to publish it  mick called Axl to ask if hes sure he really wants this heavy piece published..  Axl said  yes  do it...  Then after if was published  Axl called him a lier and said he didnt say any of that..  I dont know man..  I would just hope everything Axl has said about this guy and the others were true..  So to me its just a cash grab writing these books...  I could be wrong but Im sure the books are just bashing on Axl. And  stories we already know.. But  like I said  I could be totally wrong..
