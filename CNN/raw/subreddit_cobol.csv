I laughed when I found out the company was training me to learn COBOL coming from a web dev background at school. But who knew it would give me opportunities to travel and work abroad go back home and get offered to go back to the client again?But of course its still personal preference if you dont like what youre doing no amount of advice could make you learn what you have to.,cobol,d01m1et,3,t5_2qzti

There would be complicated controlbreaks say for example a bank report sorted by branch then by account number then by transaction amount etc. if you have multiple controlbreaks then you need to sort it by your major key then next key etc. so that it would group your info correctly.,cobol,dg3qoc4,1,t5_2qzti
