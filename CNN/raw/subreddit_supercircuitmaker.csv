9663672,0,t1_da3aclj,OK several hours and a couple of server reboots later...My power monitor is giving the signal and the lights are flashing however the purple line that triggers the pearl injector is not.Any ideas?edit Curiouser and curiouser. The circuit was working this morning with the lever at the SW corner. As mentioned above the pearl inject line isnt being triggered now. If I rotate the circuit in any of the other  rotations the pearl inject line does trigger but G reports a pearl at tick  and not enough power to hold the pearl. This seems strange to me as it looks like your bundled bus bar is connected at the same place in all  directions.Adjusting the delay between  and  ticks doesnt seem to have any effect.,supercircuitmaker,da4902p,1,t5_3hezf
