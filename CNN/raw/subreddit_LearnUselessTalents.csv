499244,0,t3_1zsdar,Straight razor shaving has a certain manly ritualistic charm and I like it a lot but I find I really only have time to do it at the weekends.The most important thing I have found when shaving with a straight is to get to know our own face. More specifically learn which direction the beard grows and where it switches from one direction to another. For example on my face mostly the beard grows in a downward direction but I have two stripes where it switches and grows upwards. Important to know as these stripes are pretty much following my carotids.Also when lathering your soap get it to the consistency you think it should be then add a bit more water. Forget the canned stuff.Then I do one pass with the grain one across and if I have time and want a really close shave one against.Edit One last thing.

Many start out plying in a sense against themselves. Their primary focus is to make themselves not predictable. In a sense that type of play is defensive. When I observe people doing this I switch to a mindset where I rule out what theyre not going to throw instead of what they will throw e.g. I know for any number of reasons they wont throw paper so I know I am safe to throw rock and even if I dont score a point I wont give one up either. ,LearnUselessTalents,ch6yqii,1,t5_2u8qf

1547130,0,t1_cja5k0b,You know seriously speaking it depends on a whole bunch of different variables such as at what altitude you use this at what can size you use to build your stove goes back to those Fosters oil can beer cans if you use a filler to more equalize the fuel consumption and how much filler you use plus how well or if your stove is sealed what youre heating etc.Bestguess approximation that I can give you from my direct experience is that while testing my first  or so stoves I used a inch popcan stove made from regular sized coke cans with  fiberglass filler and about  burner holes. I cant remember the amount of fuel I used maybe oz and I got between a  minute constant burn time. This was also at around ft above sea level. I really only was initially targeting the measurement of how much fuel I would need to bring about oz of water to a boil in a surplus military canteen  cup. I achieved full boil at around  minutes.Later I brought and please forgive me I havent used these in a while so Im dredging this up from memory a small oz squirt bottle of denatured alcohol and one of my betterreliable stoves which I had used bondo to seal the seams of at ranges between Kft and Kft and being frugal with my  fuel while using it twice a day I usually had enough to last about  days.I continued to make more stoves out of different can types and got better results including using less water and eventually through a lot of trial and error found some that worked best for me. Its still a process though and I might make some more in the next few weeks to test some more.My advice to you is build one! Experiment! Test fuel consumption at the rate of however long it takes you to boil water or heat a meal. Heres some resources for you to check out as wellThis guy is good.This fella has done some good research too.and this guy has some good information too.Finally I want to mention this guy whos not only hilarious but was a big part of what turned me onto ultralight backpacking and creating stoves myself.,LearnUselessTalents,cja7fsp,2,t5_2u8qf

I take the back of my tongue and close my throat off with it so that air cant pass in or out. Consider the reaction you have directly before youre about to vomit. Your tongue pushes back against your throat as a reflex to what is about to come spewing out of your mouth. Now try to replicate that action. Once you do that try exhaling out of your mouth with your tongue still pressed against the back. You should feel some resistance but if you do it correctly you may here a slight popping the sound of your tongue flicking back against your throat???. You can make that sound for as long as you exhale and keep pressure against the back of your throat. Try adjusting the force with which you exhale if you dont get result. I personally exhale with the same force that I would use to blow out a candle. From here you can adjust the sound you make by adjusting the force of exhalation angle of throat opening of mouth etc. Hope this helped I explained as best as I could.  Edit I just watched myself doing this in a mirror. It helps to also have the front of your tongue pushing against the back of your bottom row of teeth.

Either way he saw this has his moment to live his dream.  You could see the happiness in his face as he walked toward the bathroom with his chest puffed out and signalling people to move to the side.  He unfortunately didnt hit close enough to the lock and it was a cheap door and his entire leg went right through.  He got cut up and the girls Moms were infuriated when they got home the next day.

3945659,0,t3_35mn2l,Its hard to tell because classical music covers such a huge amount of works theres no easy protip to sort them apart from well listening to it with an attentive ear.Guessing the composer takes training... sometimes you recognize a piece because  you heard it before. Then you will also be able to tell at least the era from the music style and maybe the composer as you get more familiar.The form of a piece though is easier to identify because its much more codified.If the whole orchestra is playing together its a symphonic work   If one or sometimes two instruments have solo parts and the rest of the orchestra just plays along its a concerto. For example Vivaldis four seasons is a serie of  violin concertos. If there are no particular instrument standing out usually the theme aka the melody is played by lots of violins  its probably a symphony  Dvoraks New World Symphony If a few instruments are playing its called chamber music Usually the forms name is taken from the number of players  a duet is for two players a trio for tree etc.  Example  Mozarts Trio for violin cello and piano Notably a string quartet always had two violins a viola and a cello e.g. Beethovens String Quartet  A work for solo instrument usually goes by the name of Sonata e.g. Bachs Sonatas and partitas for violinThen there is the whole genre of classical music with voices including If singers are also actors and play through a story accompanied by the orchestra its an opera which is basically a musical of ancient times. If it doesnt tell a story then its probably a cantata see  Bachs for an example. Sacred music which is written for religious situations like  Mozarts RequiemThen  a piece is usually made by several movements for ex. a concerto usually has  movement a symphony has  etc.. Movements are named after their rythm aka tempo i.e. wether they are fast or slow but in Italian. Examples of fast movements include allegro presto and slow movements  adagio largho. Andante is taken to be the medium tempo about  bpm.Hope this help  EDIT  formatting,LearnUselessTalents,cr61f47,12,t5_2u8qf

6142959,0,t3_3zon1g,Dogs and more horizontally oriented animals are less likely to choke because their larynx is much higher up the throat which protects the windpipe from getting food in it. Humans have a much longer larynx to accommodate our complex vocal cords and along with our tongues the larynx stretches much farther down the throat which gives us a keen evolutionary advantage when it comes to choking to death on our own food. You know when youre drinking something and out nowhere you get liquid into your lungs making you hack and cough and you get really embarrassed because it looks like you dont know how to drink water properly? Thats just the occasional price you pay for having the ability to say words.This is not the case with dogs. The soft palate oralnasal separator and epiglottis windpipefoodpipe separator in dogs are  actually touching when they are at rest completely sealing off the mouth and foodpipe so dogs can breathe easy and not worry about silly things like dying.That said dogs can still choke but its unlikely and very unlikely that any choking on food is life threatening but I wont always assume Mr Scruffles knows when to alert you when its for real choking. What Im trying to say is dont start karate chopping your dog every time it starts making throaty noises but also be aware that they can choke if their throat swells shut from the neck being overly constricted in addition to having something bad lodged in there.,LearnUselessTalents,cynw1uy,27,t5_2u8qf

In fact when trying to solve this problem one should use a heuristic approach e.g. metaheuristics genetic algorithms ... which is based on randomness and checking the feasibility of a solution after actually generating a solution. More solutions would be accepted without the constraint but more importantly there would be many more feasible solutions meaning its harder to find the best one.,LearnUselessTalents,db3e4vw,2,t5_2u8qf

11359687,0,t1_dfjeu20,here in Australia there was a death about twenty years ago that was blamed on MDMA but rumour has it that it was really caused by the poor girl drinking too much and waterlogging her cells. the drugs probably had a lot to do with it too. have literally never heard of anyone else dying from drinking too much water.not arguing against what youre saying just providing an anecdote example of an extreme case.my doctor tells me the same thing as youre saying. drinking enough water to turn your piss clear is a good thing. drinking so much water that you throw up and die not a good thing.im more likely to trust my doctor than  year old rumours about a OD death.,LearnUselessTalents,dfjlll3,11,t5_2u8qf
