5700,0,t1_cef0ho9,The instant noodle packets have quite a bit of fat in them due to being prepared with palm oil so they arent pure carbs. They have some fiber as well but not much.Ill point out though that there is a difference between what people in the US call ramen which are just instant noodles and traditional ramen noodles which are a japanese staple. The latter is more like spaghetti prepared with only flour salt and either a mineral water or eggs. While as a pasta they might not be exactly a super healthy food unless you opt for a whole wheat variety they are definitely much less bad for you than the instant crap that passes for ramen in the US.,budgetfood,cef33kl,5,t5_2si9h

2575764,0,t3_2padbv,This is pretty easy. Get your oven broiling mine has a setting for lo broil or high broil I did low. Cut your grapefruit in half and then use a knife to separate the pieces. Put cinnamon and brown sugar on the top and then broil for about  minutes or until the sugar is nice and melty. Take it out sprinkle with more sugar if you like and eat it. I like this method better than how my mom fed it to me as a kid which was just cut in half and drowned in white sugar. The warmth and the cinnamon makes this feel like a really good winter breakfast or snack. You could also try this with honey or maple syrup. Also a warning for any who may not know grapefruit can interact with certain prescription medications including birth control. I enjoy one occasionally but its not a food to eat regularly if you take certain drugs.

2812643,0,t3_2saa0y,Tried to make a split pea soup from here recently cooked in my mothers old slow cooker for  hours. After getting home from work on a cold day and being super excited for this soup I take off the lid to find that the peas were still hard! Turns out  hours on low in a modern slow cooker compared to  hours in an older style slow cooker is a completely different equation. The older slow cookers cook at lower temperatures. Put the soup on the stove top and simmered it for  minutes and it reached the consistency I had intended. Lesson learned older cookers are great but need to have their times adjusted!

The whole deal there should run under  if you shop at the cheapest place in town. Cook the chickens. Pull off all the meat and portion it out to make  pots of soup. Divide up the veggies with  potatoes to a batch of soup. Use the bones peels ends and whatnot to make stock. Portion the stock into your bags for soup. You will have several pots of soup that have real nutritional value and if you eat a bowl of soup every day that can take care of your dinners for the next couple of weeks since each pot of soup should make  servings depending on your appetite. Then cook the beans with whatever you want to throw in get some peppers or garlic if you want. Toss the beans with a bit of rice for lunch and there are your lunches. Eggs and the leftover potatoes will take care of breakfasts and any extra filling you should need.Yes it will be repetitive. But it will keep you healthyer than popcorn.

3439464,0,t3_2zm4gh,My fiancee and I spend month in groceries he is a picky eaterin that he wants everything to be as healthy and sugarfree as possible and I also do all of the cooking. This is possible even with a gluten free diet. Here are some of my recommendations. Wean yourselves off of the sugary drinks. You will be much healthier and happier with your bill if you stop drinking so much sugar water. The gatorade is only extra calories unless you are truly dehydrated. It is not a healthy drink. IF you must have gatorade save  by buying the powder mixes instead of the bottles.. Cut back on the processedfrozen meals. These meals are very unhealthy and tend to have ridiculous sodium levels. I will attach a recipe for homemade corn dogs below. Leave out the floursub in a glutenfree flour such as rice or oat flour and youll be good to go.. Try to find an alternative to sandwiches for lunch. Leftovers are always a great choice. Also Boars Head? Is that a musthave deli meat brand? Try getting a cheaper brand.. Try to eat less meat. Having vegetarian meals is healthy for both you and your budget.. Buy things in bulk. Sounds like you are already doing that with rice but there are lots of things like meat you can do this with. Your freezer is your friend. This doesnt mean by mass quantities of everything. Do the math and find the cheapest oz option and go with that.Here are some recipes that you might like Baked corn dogs As I said above substitute glutenfree flour for the whole wheat flour.

7942589,0,t3_4o1kff,Make a huge pot of chili! Cook up one two pounds of ground beef. Add diced onion however much you like. I personally add some Worcestershire sauce here and about three peppers from a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce mostly deseeded. Salt and pepper to taste at some point in all this. Grab some cans of beans I usually use  cans of dark kidney beans and  can of Krogers hot chili beans and sometimes add black beans too some tomato sauce and Rotel or diced tomatoes. I love corn in chili too but I know everyone isnt into that. Add them all in and simmer for a while. This will make a ton of chili and to stretch it even further you can eat it over rice or scoop some onto a baked potato for lunch. A baked potato even in the microwave and some eggs are a good breakfast or oatmeal with bananas or strawberries. Grab some baby carrots and something to dip them in for a quick snack. ,budgetfood,d48tki1,15,t5_2si9h

I also forgot to pull the hot peppers from the fridge so theyre not in the picture sorry.  Like I said this is the height of the season  end of the summer crops start of the fall crops and some quickgrowing transitional stuff  so other weeks I might get a bit less variety.Ill be doing the PYO tomorrow.  For produce thatll be some okra peppers and tomatoes and then therell be about  flowers for the house and some friends and a bunch of herbs.  Most of the time I either freeze or dry the herbs for later use but recently Ive been experimenting with flavoured vinegars if theyre successful Ill give some away at Christmas.  Im also saving up the lavendar right now when the seasons over Im going to try making essential oil of lavendar and if that works Ill give it as a present to a friend whos into aromatherapy.Regarding the amount of food when you buy into a CSA youre buying a farm share for the year.  Theyll give you an estimate on how much youll get each week mine is give us  and well try to give you half a bushel a week but its not a guarantee.  If the farm does well youll get a bunch of extra produce if theres a drought or a hurricane or something youll get less though in that case youd be paying more at the store anyway.The beginning of the year is always a bit disappointing a lot of lettuce  I recommend making lettuce soup when you get tired of it its both filling and decenttasting and the end of the year is always a joy.,budgetfood,d7x13tp,3,t5_2si9h

9483125,0,t3_5ajnas,Sorry for wall of text ahead of timeHonestly if you have those problems you will need to find ways to expand your like eating into the can.Just because something isnt your favorite doesnt mean you dont eat it sometimes. Especially on any sort of restricted diet.First off a potato barely counts as a veggie and when it does its skin on. Its pretty much just a carb.You need to give us a list of foods you like and more importantly what you can not eat. We can see what we can do from there. Who knows maybe youll learn to like something.Otherwise honestly you are going to end up sick and dying early if you dont force a change. I used to hate a ton of different vegetables lets say half of them didnt like specific textures didnt like having onions on anything avoided various flavors. But I pushed through that by just preparing something just a little outside of my comfort zone...and waiting until I was hungry.So far Ive checked off cooked tomatoes part way through raw limited cucumber Gourds squash and such turnip mixed with some potato or in stews Onions of all sorts Broccoli lightly cooked with cheese  Olives  Peppers greenredetcAre some of the things I can now at least stand or even enjoy because I went out of my way to slowly include them in my meals or to find middle ground items. Like using salsa to lead to tomatoes or tzatziki sauce for cucumbers or mixing turnip and potato.You can be less of a picky eater and that makes cooking and eating stuff that will help you actually live easier. ,budgetfood,d9hzzi3,2,t5_2si9h

9829139,0,t1_dakwo2j,you are  correct I stated that g protein is HALF the recommended value for the dayaverage between men and women because the audience here varies in size and gender.  the number you quote is from a self described hardcoreBODYBUILDING MAGAZINE a place that promotes large muscle gainhardcore gains something that is not necessary for most humansin its extreme hardcore forms male or female.  Lifting weights to maintain or build muscle is healthy and should be promoted but lean muscle mass can be generatedalbeit a little slower by eating close to the RDA from the USDA LINK  In the graph found in the link you provide it also appears that it uses arbitrary units in the description.  to take this further .gkg seems to yield considerable benefit to the synthetic rate.  I am not arguing that increased intake has no benefits what we are discussing here is the RDA for protein intake in adult humans.Furthermore your own magazine has Tarnopolsky saying that .glb is sufficient for bodybuilders link  Later in the article it shows a graph that states .gkg is the UPPER LIMIT to where additional protein intake ceases to yield benefits not as you stated The take away message here is that the optimal amount of protein is .g per kg .  For a bodybuilder this appears to be a reasonable number I will not question that. But please use and read the graphs before using them as evidence to your cause. You are  correct that eating only oats leads to an incomplete amino acid profile.  A healthy and complete diet composed entirely of plants does lead to a complete profile.  Yes spinach has a measly g per g but when paired with beans nuts seeds rice oats and many other plant based foods the stacking and cumulative effect gives a HEALTHY plant eater more than enough protein AND a complete amino acid profile.  there are very likely many healthy people who eat .gkg protein per day and I wish them the best.  But the RDA is still .gkg.  I am not arguing for or against meat consumption but simply the RDA in the USA and that protein added to maintain healthy function does not need to be from a meat source.  it could be but does not need to be.If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them all as well as provide my references.edited with some extra words splelling errors and unit corrections.   ,budgetfood,daorbfa,1,t5_2si9h
