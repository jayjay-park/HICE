7176419,0,t3_43e9ys,Name Khan HegemonyLeader Krall KhanLore In the distant past their is a tale of a Man and his brother who lived on the outskirts of the great wastes. It is said Man grew jealous of his Brother when their God accepted his offering but rejected the Mans. Because of that God cursed the Man with a cruel mark and banished him into the wastes where it is he wandered for the rest of his.That tale is only partially true. For this Mans name was Kruel Khan and instead of dying in the wastes he conquered it. In those days the various wasteland tribes primarily consisted for outcasts thieves and murderers. Unwanted and rejected by their home tribes. For many years they lived among the harsh wasteland before the arrival of Kruel Khan who through his natural strength and charisma united the wayward tribes into a powerful horde of warriors.During this time the horde now known as the Khan horde would raid and plunder the various villages and cities on the outskirts of the wastes bringing vengeance for their rejection from these places. It is even said that Kruel Khan personally led a hunt for his brothers head.As the years passed the Horde grew wary of this way of life. Upon hearing these murmurs Kruel Khan ignored them. Believing a life of of raiding and pillaging was the only worthwhile way to live.He continued to think this for the rest of his life until his son Krall cut his head off.Under the leadership of Krall the Horde settled within the harsh wastes although their initial bloodlust had subsided this did end up influenced the formation of a castebased Hegemony. With the ruling family The Khans being in absolute power and everyone else being divided into the Horde Military Sandtamers Farmers craftsmen and merchants and Untouchables Slaves. location Heart of the great wasteland.,CivWorldPowers,d1tw5wk,1,t5_3c779
