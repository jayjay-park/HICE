2963016,0,t1_co4vcpe,Theres improvements that can be made to action systems that will atleast capture the spirit of older games. Create animations for every attack. This makes you vulnerable whenever you attack so spamming may not be the optimal strategy.. Ability Resources. Spamming will cause you to quickly run out of StaminaManaWhatever so you need to make your abilities count. This is actually one way to make tankydefensive Archetypes relevant because they can outlive your ability resources and whittle you down when youve run out of options.,crowfall,co4wrgt,3,t5_35qsx

8867047,0,t1_d7dn1k0,Mounts and pack animals are hopefully useful and assuming they perform in a way that makes gameplay easier than without them being able to buy them is an advantage. Regardless if you can obtainlose them ingame.VIP provides a player to have more varietyoptions for their characters which should be an advantage with the Vessel system and being able to swap between archetypesbuilds in a CW.That is just what is currently available long before release. Nothing stopping them from adding more down the line that walks or crosses the line into cash for advantage or short cuts.The FAQ says we cant buy things that affect gameplay but the above seem to go against this.Factor in rd party unofficial channels and Im sure well see gold sellers itemsresources for sale strongholds whatever.The EK stuff might be fluffcosmetic but if that is where a lot of the out of CW economy and interaction will take place I bet that the best looking EKs who spent the most on strongholds will be most popular. Depending on what they do with taxes and EK perks this could result in owners gaining currencyresources more easily than some poor mans EK built from the ground up with sweat and tired fingers.Will Thralls Relics and other items be bound to EKs or players? Can we selltrade them ingame? If so that is another way for cash for power.Personally dont see a huge issue with it yet but I also plan to stick to the Dregs where most of this wont matter hopefully. However I assume the other rulesets will be more popular and will see more of the cash to advantage taking place.Just my view though I could be completely off.,crowfall,d7dp0py,1,t5_35qsx

9625710,0,t1_d9ww2ly,You dont have a single example of a game you can recommend to me where this approach is successful? All the games which attempted it are effectively dead or completely dead. Reproducing it here will yield the same result.This isnt a coincidence you can tell when a game with an auction house is dying by the amount of things that could be on the auction house which simply arent. When there is no market and people ask about a thing in chat and only hear crickets in response it sends the signal to them that the game is dead even if it may not be. People stop bothering to ask when they keep not getting a response and then stop logging in entirely. Raw chat doesnt provide community it imposes demands upon it. Thats the problem that vendors were invented to solve it was a crude early implementation better systems have come along that solve the problem better.There are always caps on the amounts of listings which players can make they do have to decide which things they list and which things they just keep an ear open for. Some things literally arent worth their time to respond to as well even if they have them and the buyer is willing to pay above market value for.Suppose you farm for an hour and spam about your tin daggers for an hour to buy a broadsword instead of just farming the two hours required to forge your own broadsword if you dont sell those daggers for enough to buy your broadsword in that hour you are literally wasting your time players wont be coerced into wasting their time.
