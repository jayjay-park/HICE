2858323,0,t3_2ssnpm,Anytime you make a large deposit by check at an ATM regardless of the bank their internal policy conducts an automated risk review on your account to determine the chances of that item being fraudulent or bad.What this means to youBanks are required to make the first  of an ATM deposit available for withdrawal immediately unless they have predetermined the item will not pay for various reasons at that point no funds will be made available.The item you deposited at the ATM was placed on hold for further review  business days generally covers the review period with that being said here are some things you can do. If you are able to print out a recent statement of your account at the issuing bank and it shows that the funds arewould be available to clear the item once it is presented bring this to one of your local branches and ask them to consider the account balance to date. Call the bank on the next normal banking business day this will be Tuesday the th and ask them to review your deposit while you are on the phone. Most banks in general will accommodate this request as long as you are polite and they are able to get in contact with someone from the bank your check is drawn off of. If you have a branch that you visit regularly to the point where maybe the tellers and possibly the branch manager know you it is possible you can use your banking relationship with them to also have them request internally on your behalf an expedited review of your deposit.With all that being said the primary reason for the deposit being placed on hold is a risk review. You did not do anything wrong keep in mind that Bank Wires also fall under the same scrutiny so there is also a chance that a Wire coming into your account could be frozen for review.Call your bank on the next normal banking business day and talk to them.

Until the name transfer occurs by the back office of the bank most banks would not be willing to give out ANY information to Awake out of fear that the documentation wont be accepted so he most likely wouldnt be able to get anything out of the branch.,Banking,csnki3s,1,t5_2r392

You could hang out at rbitcoin but the gist is that youll be holding a password protected bitcoin file a wallet that holds some number of bitcoins. When you want to sell you transfer the bitcoins either to the buyer themselves somewhat risky like paying a person on Craigslist by bank transfer before they mail you merchandise and they give you cash. Or more likely youll make an account on a site like Mt. Gox or whatever it is the kids use today and find a buyer willing to pay the price you want. Bitcoin leaves your virtual account money comes in and hopefully you can transfer the money into your bank account.I ask about the shared bank account because unless hes not the type to notice youll have to keep quiet until you leave at which point you can withdraw the money from the shared accounts.

The card brands get this information from their own independent research and from notifications they receive from law enforcement agencies.  When they notify a bank they do not share which merchant was potentially compromised.So the bank may not know however lets say they thought they did... And they told  people that Tims Coffee Cantina may be the point of failure.  Well  people will probably never again shop at Tims.  The company may go out of business.  Now imagine that the breach wasnt the fault of Tims... Perhaps the banks conclusions were wrong or maybe Tims was fully compliant with industry best practices and couldnt have avoided it.The bank can now be held liable for making assertions that impacted Tims business.  Thats not good for the bank so theres an incentive to let the card brands deal with merchants as they should.  Now in addition the bank has an agreement with the card brand that doesnt allow them to identify the merchant specifically for the reasons above and breach of that contract could jeopardize the banks ability to issue debit or check cards.TLDr  the bank may not know but their hands are tied anyway.,Banking,d1cwqng,6,t5_2r392
