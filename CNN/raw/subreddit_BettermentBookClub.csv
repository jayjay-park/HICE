4234831,0,t1_cs2mzit,A I also think this is tricky. Justice is complex.Though justice deals with our relation to others and virtue our private morals they are not far apart. Aristotle states that only virtuous people can be truly just. I interpret this as justice merely being an extension of virtue. On the other hand particular justice can consist of single acts that in themselves are just and virtuous but do not stem from a just and virtuous whole.I dont think Aristotle is completely consistent regarding virtue and justice. For someone to be treated unjustly someone else must have gained from that. By implying this justice is made into a zerosum game whereas virtue is not.Aristotle does differentiate between different types of justice and this is crucial. Youll probably have to look there for answers.B The authority is not to be struck in turn because it is just performing its function duty. Therefore it is not making a choice ? and it is acting involuntarily. I assume the authority is a true authority in this case meaning that it has authority on rational virtuous grounds.The man who strikes an authority is doing so voluntarily which makes it a possible vice. Striking a just authority requires choice. I agree that this was an unclear example.C The unjust and injustice are the same thing. Unjust is an adjective and injustice is a noun. ,BettermentBookClub,cs2yjnc,5,t5_34j5y

4724986,0,t3_3fm4i1,Really enjoyed this section of the book. I always find myself wondering if Im meditating the right way but Chapter  Fine Print Outer really answered every question for me and made me feel a lot better about just sitting down and decompressing trying to relax and take some time out of my day to take my brain off autopilot.Ive tried a mediation schedule in the past and often found myself forcing to sit for twenty or thirty minutes with a time that then made it feel like a chore instead of a break in the day. udeansluyter s description of meditation is just..... so much more CHILL!!!! Instead of a chore he describes it almost as a gift a break in the day to reset your mind and just enjoy being yourself turned off for a minute. I really took a lot out of chapter  and Im looking forward to reading Chapter   Fine Print Inner tonight.,BettermentBookClub,ctq4hkv,3,t5_34j5y
4849788,0,t3_3h4jet,Both of these last two chapters felt a little beyond me. I feel as though maybe after meditating for a few months I could come back and try these passages again but they just seem to be above any level Ive been able to yet achieve. But hey at least Dean says thats a possibility so I dont feel like Im totally failing mediation . I tried to meditate on I but found this to be the most challenging yet I think for the reason Dean states there is no point of focus for the meditation. It seems like staying within yourself would be even simpler than trying to switch yourself with another but somehow this was even more challenging. It could also have just been a not great meditation session for me in general because my mind remained more active than usual. The story at the beginning of Chapter  is beautiful. I love the message here that all of life can and should be experienced in a meditative state. I hope that someday Im able to bring that calm and peace to every moment. ,BettermentBookClub,cu5unux,5,t5_34j5y

5394140,0,t3_3oq9do,I am a new member of this subreddit and Im already loving the first book. The Alchemist seems like an unconventional choice from the other books discussed before it is full of wisdom and proverbial advice. Id like the briefly answer the suggested questions and then engage in discussion.gt What is your opinion of the book so far? Was it what you expected? Are you pleased or disappointed in it?This book is by no means what I expected but to be honest Im not sure what it was that I expected from a book titled The Alchemist. I am pleased with the book because of the way it leaves itself open to all sorts of interpretations. It takes us back to a world where things were simpler and establishes an allegorical view of what it means to live with purpose.gtHow do you feel about the main character Santiago?Santiago is a boy who feels he is bound by his obligations tending to his sheep he enjoys reading stories of successful men and allows his curiosity to lead him in new situations. In a way he carries the same ambitions that we all have to discover the world. But just like all menwomen do he encounters a fork in the road where he contemplates going after the person of their dreams or going after their literal dream.gtDescribe your interpretation of the encounter with Melchizedek the King of Salem. This discussion was loaded with wisdom and quotable material what stuck out to you the most?I pay close attention to Melchizedeks words whenever Santiago sits down with him. Melchizedek plays the role of a mentor for Santiago and although it may not come cheap at first he gives Santiago practicable advice that can be used when Santiago can no longer rely on his own conscience the black amp white stones. Melchizedek identifies himself as a warrior of the light and has experienced what it is like to live in the corporate realm Africa. The piece of advice from Melchizedek that stuck out to me the most is this Treasures are uncovered by the force of flowing water and buried by the same current. I believe that treasures  opportunities and flowing water  the everrunning hand of time.gtWhat do you feel is your Personal Legend? Do you already know what it is? If you dont do you need to find it? Are you living it currently? Tell us.My personal legend may seem like an unrealistic one but I want to be a social entrepreneur and ultimately a philanthropist against thirdworld poverty. I look at people like Manoj Bhargava and Bill Gates as my role models and believe that if I make it my sole purpose to be among their like I can make a dent against poverty. mind you I am not claiming I want to be a billionaire like them. I just want to be able to be in a position where I can extend my wellbeing to those in need.gtWhat did you take away from the fable about the oil on the spoon?This fable was pretty straightforward in its moral message. If you choose to live a life led by curiosity ambition and the guide of good omens NEVER forget about where you began. Just as Santiago realized that he should never forget about his beloved sheep we should never forget about our obligations to our loved ones our family and our friends. Although they may sometimes seem like a burden to us they have instilled values and principles in us that will help us learn how to conduct ourselves in the realcorporate world. The sheep taught Santiago how to detect the presence of snakes among other things I cant recall right now.,BettermentBookClub,cw15tra,3,t5_34j5y
5427179,0,t1_cw0c8kb,gt I especially welcome quests for shalom and inner joy.I find it interesting that you use the word quest. Do you feel that opportunities present themselves to you as such? Do you seek out these sorts of experiences or actively look for omens to point you there?,BettermentBookClub,cw5dme9,3,t5_34j5y

6508197,0,t3_44sd6j,DAY   FEB  The mood in my office has been quite somber this morning. When I came in I immediatly felt drained and not as cheerful as I usually do as I adjusted to the attitudes of the people surrounding me. Recognizing this I have upped my own mood and feel as though Ive brought some others to my current level as well. Success!DAY   FEB  I set my goals for the day every morning but the snowfall has created an interesting dilemma. Ive been invited to ski for the evening and Im going to take that opportunity to enjoy my life and what I love to do but not at the expense of getting everything done that I wanted to accomplish today. I made a commitment when I wrote down my goals and Im going to stick to them something looks like it may have to give and I choose to sacrifice a bit of sleep if that be the case. I can both enjoy my life and get the things done that I need to.DAY   FEB  Began the day off feeling very unproductive. Mind just felt lethargical and empty. Decided that I can be productive and get the things done that I need to if I just relax and focus. Have been taking care of all of my tasks ever since. About to leave work feeling refreshed and accomplished.DAY   FEB  Been a strange day to say the least. Mind all over the place. Think I will do some reevaluating tonight to make sure that tomorrow Im accomplishing everything that I need to and staying in the mindsets I need to be in.DAY   FEB  Having trouble staying Proactive today if Im being honest. I suppose not all days are going to be perfect.DAY   FEB  Had a relaxing unproductive weekend. Trying to reset my mindset and get back on the horse this week. Deciding now to maintain focus and heading to read my mission statement to remind myself of what is most important to me before I dive into my task list.DAY   FEB  Today has really just begun but I already feel on top of the world. Killed it at the gym this morning looking sharp and dapper today in the office just grabbed my first cup of coffee for the day and ready to buckle down! Im going to get shit DONE today DAY   FEB  my mindset was on point today thats all I can really recall. Felt like I was in a good mood.DAY   FEB  Its easy to be proactive on a Friday DAY   FEB  Fell behind on my updates but tomorrow is a new day! The goal for tomorrow... Give  in my tasks and hit the pillow knowing I gave the day my all.DAY   FEB  traveling for work can really throw off your plans. Ended up going out to dinner to network but still jammed my workout in somehow and ended up enjoying myself.DAY   FEB  Man Im rolling today didnt let my low energy get the better of me. Late in the afternoon and Im still popping off tasks get at me! Going to hit some yoga then watch some NBA and God dammit Ive earned myself a cigar. DAY   FEB  best believe Ill be back tomorrow too!,BettermentBookClub,czshwgd,4,t5_34j5y
6696598,0,t3_47apoe,This sweet word Synergy! No one would mind it. The question is how to get there. Coveys approach is heavily based on putting first things first Habit  thinking WinWin  and seeking to understand . Have to admit it makes sense. I like his illustration especially marriage  resulting in children  or  etc. Coveys examples are powerful including examples in business. One is left to want more. Are out there concise guides on how to develop synergy?,BettermentBookClub,d0bzifw,1,t5_34j5y
