4964782,0,t1_cukbx2y,This has happened to me a few times too most recently in the hide amp seek event. I was parked sitting still in my massacro after the first car was found and suddenly cops wanted me. Problem is there was cops in the area for a long time when there shouldnt have been.Cops in GTAO are quite territorial from what Ive seen. Once they deploy in one area even if you have no stars you have to get out of their way its almost like if the see you look at them wrong youll get one star.I guess it could also be a desync error of some kind when theres many players in one area.,GTAV_Cruises,cukcl8u,1,t5_35rlk
