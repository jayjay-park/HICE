8539035,0,t3_4wnag2,This would be really cool.  I am by no means an expert but I will try my best....I take it that you are looking for a living moss correct?  I would suggest that you adhere some kind of base layer to the sculpture with a silicone caulk.  There is this video where the individual has a product that enables the growth of moss by capturing the moisture on the vertical walls and that tube he makes.  The way that you can achieve what you want in my thought process is to glue some of that base down to each side and then paint on the dried moss or transplant different mosses onto it.  I would fear that your sculpture may not be porous enough to promote moss growth and the name of the game would be to fabricate that environment moisture without compromising the design.  Sorry if this doesnt help too much it is very early here and I am only  coffee into today.    Let me know if this helps or hurts! ,Mosses,d68y37f,2,t5_36hg6
