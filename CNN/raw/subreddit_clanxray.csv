766567,0,t1_cgrdjcz,AceyThanks for your prompt reply. I appreciate your time as I know how valuable it is.This clan fit me perfectly in every way a core group coming together and it was casual.When I joined I understood this clan desctribed as casual play when you want be respectful and maybe not mature as in some folks might love Bieber but mature as in people who do not approve of or engage in griefing IE doing things for malicious intent in order to get a reaction or people who were never in chat on the forum nothing.I assumed these things about something I spend many hours of my day involved in on any given day and some days very little to none at all.I rage quite because like in chess I saw the moves from that point forward with Lance and You. I am not interested in seeing my clan mates beg to have something done IE chat was on all day about starting the war where is Acey why cant we start and I read it over and over where a couple of others would say he will be here hang on it was a long time but I already knew what casual meant it also means patience.I never made a comment regarding the time it took to start and understand real life comes first after all this is a casual clan.Edit hereI did not leave due to the delay in starting the war or even specifically the nonaction about war castle troop donations I left because of the lack of communication and action across many things and the promptness which things are even discussed. Any comment regarding a proposed clan action is met with the reply of We are a casual clan. Casual does not mean you let people walk on you.Casual does not mean ignoring an issue being addressed by every clan leader throughout the game in a resonable time. That is why I left I am certainly not mad at you but there is always some degree of seriousness in anything you spend any of your time which is so precious even when spent on a game. I know full well the clan cycles through people and stays full and would never want to hurt the clan anyway. There are many fine people I had the pleasure of getting to know. There are issues which must be addressed in any clan maintenance with people even when you are casual you take out the old pizza boxes and empties you have to make room for the new ones Sorry to have taken so much of it with this post and I wholeheartedtly wish everyone in the clan the best.
