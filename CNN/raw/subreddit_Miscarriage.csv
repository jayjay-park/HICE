736628,0,t3_22l8dx,You are allowed to feel bitterness and resentment. Its okay to be angry. No one can tell you how you are supposed to feel not even us. We all process grief differently. Im sorry your mom isnt being as supportive as she should be. Im sure she doesnt even realize how she is making you feel. Many years have passed since her miscarriage and she already had you before hand. I think its different when it is your first pregnancy. If you are not comfortable visiting your sister in the hospital then dont. Once shes awake and able to have guests give her a phone call instead. Gently explain to her that you wont be able to visit her in the hospital and why. Let her know that youll be there to see her the day she gets home and cant wait to meet your new niecenephew.

2263658,0,t3_2l4lxi,There are options.  There is the medical option which gets it going but is least invasive but I think you have to have a  cyclemonth wait to TTC again because its effects are toxic.  There is the DampC option which many people elect because it gets it over sooner you have to wait one full cycle before trying again.  Sometimes the medical doesnt work and the DampC is necessary anyway a few people have reported that here.  I went the natural option and it sucked but did not go on forever if it had I could have asked for the DampC.  ,Miscarriage,clriayq,1,t5_2svyr

For me I spent the past two weeks trying to find the perfect nursing chair and now all of my ads are showing me various gliders and other wingback recliners. Ive been desperately window shopping in an attempt to get them out of my targeted ads but it doesnt seem to be working.  Im so sorry dear. Hope it gets better for you,Miscarriage,cp42dmh,3,t5_2svyr
3425018,0,t1_cpig2vz,I think that these doctors want to try to avoid having to do a DampC if at all possible due to the fact that it is considered surgery and they want to use only as a last resort. They say that its healthier to let your body take care of this type of thing which I agree with so thats why expectant management was advised as a first step. When we first learned that there could be problems I had told my husband that I wanted a DampC so that it would be quick and relatively painless but as time went on and I did more research I changed my mind. Surgery actually scares me a little if Im completely honest. My husband and I own a business and hes not able to just take time off and I wouldnt want him to so I dont really have anyone that could drive me to have it done anyway. Ive also done my research and not trying to scare or dissuade you either there run small risks that Im not willing to take. Plus the healing time is about  weeks which Im not crazy about. Im just as worried about the meds though. Ive done research there too. Every womans story is different. Hell the meds dont even work for some women and they end up having a DampC anyway. Ugh I just hope that Im not one of those. Just having the medication will be somewhat of a comfort to me. Ill get it on a Thursday but I think Ive decided to give my body the weekend to get things started. If I still havent started Ill be taking the meds either Sunday night or Monday morning. As long as Im not showing signs of a uterine infection that should be fine. I just hope that if I do have to resort to the meds Ill be able to pass everything on my own without the DampC. That was a really long reply sorry.,Miscarriage,cpiodwo,1,t5_2svyr

I went in a couple weeks earlier than my scheduled first ultrasound due to pains which ended up being an ectopic pregnancy that they had to remove immediately. I was surprised they didnt automatically cancel the other appointment. But what made it even worse after I cancelled I just did it online their office called me trying to reschedule!

Its not like you have to feel like you are  strong for it to be so. Whether or not you feel like Superman is not indicative of whether or not you are.

6199372,0,t1_cyt1adt,Thank you for that encouragement my wife and I had been married for  months when she fell pregnant and our parents all freaked out because we were apparently too young to have children. I can indeed say that in this time we have drawn closer to one another and have learnt to deal with each others new quirks.  We have wanted to see someone about it all but in our area a psychologist or a counselor is not available to those who do not have the cash to dramatically fork out.  The reason we havent seen someone is literally only that.I think my wife might also have PTSD  we found a page explaining the symptoms on unspokengrief and my wife matched all the symptoms but a psychologist is not really an option for us. We go with a little less than a healthy amount of food some days so we are left deciding whether we are going to eat for a week or go to a psychologist.Well done on leaving your job thats really brilliant and encouraging that you are doing something that is actually enjoyable!,Miscarriage,cyuaw4e,2,t5_2svyr

Id recommend contacting the nearest maternalfetal medicine department and asking them what support group they refer their patients to and they can help direct you to one often the hospital they are connected to has one.  I can tell you that for me  year out after doing a lot of talking with others who are years out I have come to realize the pain will never go away but you learn to live life with the background of that pain.  I too think about it daily but its not something that I can or will ever get over nor is it fair to expect one to.  Its rough to realize there are no good answers to what happened.  This has helped open my eyes to all the pain out there in the world the parents who have lost multiple kids to things like wars the rape and slaughter so prevalent in our history such unimaginable suffering out there.

To sing to laugh to be exhausted to feed to protect. To love my baby. Its such a raw profound loss. Ive found myself becoming numb quite often too. I think people just want me to be okay and to be okay quickly. But I want to cry I want to feel the pain of my baby gone forever.

8853489,0,t3_51b2x7,I am so sorry for your sisters loss. I had a missed miscarriage at  weeks in March and it was the most devastating heartbreaking experience I could have ever imagined. There is so much good advice here and I couldnt agree more with what has been said. Heres my  cents.People have different opinions on flowers but Id like to add that for me receiving flowers actually upset me. I dont think this is the norm but just thought Id mention it. Personally I didnt want to look at them and even worse was having to throw them out when they died and clean the vase etc.My mom sent me a necklace about a week or  later its a heart with an angel charm and engraved on the heart it says a piece of my heart is in heaven. She warned me about it thankfully and I still sobbed when it came in the mail. Its not something I wear but I cherish it and will keep it forever.For me the thing I needed most was to talk about it. Going through a miscarriage made me feel extremely lonely because of the unfortunate stigma so many people have gone through it but rarely people talk about it other than safe spaces like this one. Everyone around me was having baby after healthy baby and I felt like I am the only person who is going through this. Everyone is different some people prefer to deal more internally but I really needed to know that I could talk about it with those close to me and they wouldnt just try to comfort me with generic words or gently change the subject which sometimes happened. Let her know you are there to listen if she needs to talk about her experience. I cant stress enough how isolating my miscarriage was a side effect I did not expect even though my husband and I were going through it together. I grieved for a long time and even when I started to feel better I wanted and needed to talk about it. Therapy helped me a lot and I even went to acupuncture for the grief which helped short term.

I dont think she is blaming herself or if she is she hasnt expressed that at all. We did have several discussions before we even conceived about this being a real possibility due to age and a couple of minor health issues.We have already started to plan for the next attempt. We really want kids and Im hoping that focusing on the future instead of what could have been will be helpful. It seems to be working I think.

Say you dont want to talk about it but wanted to ask for their patience in case the holiday is hard on you. Say kind things to yourself during the commute. Tell yourself you are good and brave and strong and resilient because you are. Tell yourself you are loving and loved because you are. Do what feels right. Not the loud feelings like kidnapping a baby which I  considered too but the deep true feelings. You can cry. You can hold him or refuse to look at him. You can change your mind. You can go for a walk by yourself. You can do whatever you need to as long as you are kind to yourself.Fathers Day is for JuneSmilly to worry about. Shell manage. You can always lean on us. Just leave that sorrow for June. Itll keep. The years with your cousin and her child will also keep til later. You will find a kernel of good and you will make it through because the alternative is not surviving. And eventually you will wholeheartedly want to survive. Start with one hour at a time. You will make it through.,Miscarriage,dads0fp,2,t5_2svyr

10643616,0,t3_5saxlf,I dont think you can know anything for sure yet. Im sorry you will have a long week waiting on more news. For my first pregnancy I had an ultrasound about wd and they also saw just a gestational sac. My beta numbers were also a little low. My doctor was a little concerned but told me it could really go either way at that point. Unfortunately that pregnancy ended up being a blighted ovum for me baby never started developing and I had to take meds to miscarry about  weeks after that after  more ultrasounds didnt show any heartbeat or fetal development. That is definitely not the only outcome of that situation though. I have heard LOTS of stories where the first ultrasound was inconclusive or only showed a sac and then everything was completely fine a week later. wd is so early to have an ultrasound that you really shouldnt expect to see much. Its just good news that it is not ectopic. The uterine anatomy abnormality could be a potential issue but just take things one step at a time for now if you can. ,Miscarriage,dddt2qn,1,t5_2svyr
10693266,0,t1_dcet9gl,Your response has helped me deal with my own situation much better.  Thanks so much! ,Miscarriage,ddixj9h,1,t5_2svyr
10728146,0,t3_5tdrr3,I am so sorry you feel like you bear this loss on your own. My husband is totally obvious to dates surrounding our miscarriage date of positive date of miscarriage due date etc. It sucks but he is pretty bad with birthdays holidays and anniversaries as it is. I just gently remind him usually after he asks whats wrong. While he doesnt feel the grief to the extent that I do he tries to be comforting at least. Its okay to remind the people in your life of what you have lost. There is no shame in your love or grief for your Frankie. Hugs. ,Miscarriage,ddmj0vb,1,t5_2svyr

10971156,0,t1_debl9qu, I cant bring myself to cancel all the appointments I had lined up genetics counselling NT ultrasound first OB appointment. It felt overwhelming at the time  seeing my planner overflowing with appointments and drs visits  but I would give anything in the world to be able to keep them. ,Miscarriage,debli5j,1,t5_2svyr
10982893,0,t1_decvh9z,Nope. Every doctor asks if I have pain. I dont have any. Maybe some period cramp like feelings but not pain.,Miscarriage,decvjyf,1,t5_2svyr
11111688,0,t1_deowpo3,Thank you so much for your kind words they were spot on. Im so sorry that you had to go through this . Sending hugs your way. They didnt run additional tests... I think theyre just planning on having the ultrasound next week confirm. ,Miscarriage,deri0yh,1,t5_2svyr
11291678,0,t3_5zqyi3,Im also ADHD and get the same advice and also had a mc which Im just now hopefully at the end of. I dont know what to tell you except that I can relate and its hard.Ill repeat to you what I keep hearing and maybe it can help us both Its not your fault. This could have happened for a lot of different reasons and you did the best thing you could with everything you knew. It could have happened anyway and once again it is not your fault. ,Miscarriage,dfbw8ut,1,t5_2svyr
11435427,0,t1_dfeyx5u,Oh absolutely. The amount of crap that came out was just ridiculous. Some of it I could figure out but most is a mystery.Thankfully mine is finally over. Not even spotting anymore.,Miscarriage,dfs709b,1,t5_2svyr
11659476,0,t1_dggo44a,Thanks so much for the kind words. I didnt really expect to get sound medical advice from the internet just thought it was worth a shot to see if anyone else had any experience with a stubborn miscarriage before racking up more medical bills. Im sticking with Tylenol and ibuprofen for now and racking up the medical bills tomorrow.,Miscarriage,dghm74l,1,t5_2svyr
11713389,0,t1_dgncxx9,Im in the exact same boat. . Right now at home feeling helpless. Wont find out for sure until tomorrow morning. But I know. I just dont feel pregnant anymore. Its strange because it doesnt seem real. I barely felt like so was going to be a mom  and now its gone. I felt really sad at first and now Im strangely detached. Hang in there ladies. ,Miscarriage,dgnqq0n,2,t5_2svyr
