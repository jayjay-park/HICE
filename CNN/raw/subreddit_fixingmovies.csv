A mere voice to guide the hero and one who sees darkness within him and shows slight distrust but mostly feels bad knowing theres good within Anakin.I think the thing I like the most is the Jedi in decline. Anakins birth at the peak of the Jedi makes zero sense. There were wars where they could have used him but being in their peak distrusting this child and knowing hes supposed to bring balance to a force where the Sith are thought to be destroyed?

7366677,0,t1_d2dylvu,Its a bad theory IMO because it mistakes narrative allegory for inworld reality. The aliens are pretty much meant to be allegorical demons not literal demons. I mean we even see the UFOs in hexagonal pattern in the sky in the television and the whole narration operates on the premise they are aliens. All the exposition and such are given from the perspective they are actual aliens. All of this is just extremely bad screenwriting if the aliens are meant to be literal demons instead of literal aliens acting as an allegory for demons.,fixingmovies,d2fjglx,1,t5_3bqjz

7575874,0,t3_4j050a,The problem with Miranda for me goes deeper than the fact bane gets pushed aside for her its that it doesnt make any sense at all that shes even involved. After Rachel its pretty much stated that Bruce will never love again but then some new hot chick just walks in a few scenes later and steals his heart. The only reason Miranda was there was because Nolan thought he needed a love interest after Rachael and the only way to justify it was to give Miranda an ulterior motive.That also might have worked but then theres the strange tattoo that clearly looks familiar to Bruce from all that time he spent on that mountain with a bunch of assassins ringing any bells Bruce? but he just ignores it before giving her the keys to a clean energy machine which is located in the sewers not too hard for us to figure out bane is around somewhere which they actually say out loud could be used as a nuclear bomb if it fell into the wrong handsIt all just stinks of Bmovie laziness and not nearly good enough to match the previous two films. ,fixingmovies,d33c981,8,t5_3bqjz

They show a few team up battles and I was waiting for the overcharged unibeam to take out one of the Leviathans.When that didnt happen I was expecting what you said Thor to charge him back to life. but that didnt happen either.I think something may have been changed or cut here I think there was a set up that was never completed.,fixingmovies,d3jb6y1,13,t5_3bqjz

Like they were obviously trying to copy Mega Man but completely missed the whole point of what made his design good.Its like if there was a MichaelBayesque live action movie and the design used in that was wrapped around a character with Mega Mans proportions. Well okay maybe not that bad but still.I like Calls design though. Its still a little busy and obviously just an expy of Roll and not the design I voted for haha but at least its bright and appealing.And while Im here Havent actually played the game yet but why the heck did they go with Beck and Call as their names? With the original we had Rock and Roll which is cooler and fits with the musical themenaming they had going giving us other characters like Blues BassForte Beat etc but I dont see what kinda theme Beck and Call fit into. It just seems like another random attempt to copy the original without any understanding. Beck and Call would be better names for like a pair of servant robots or something.PS Also the whole idea of making a spiritual successor to Mega Man is kinda pointless IMO.

8792226,0,t3_50iesa,The cooler version is much worse. Its not even a Suicide Squad movie. Theres no Suicide Squad in it. Not once in the description of your version of the movie do you use terms such as Suicide Squad Task Force X or even team. It is a Deadshot movie the first part of which is about him helping Amanda Waller set a trap for the Joker and the second part is a prison riot. You rightly criticize the actual movie for the slapdash way it introduces Boomerang thats his name not Kangaroo Slipknot and Katana but in your version Boomerang is quickly killed after hes introduced like Slipknot in the movie Slipknot and Killer Croc disappear after they give up what they know about Harleys location and El Diablo seems to come out of nowhere during the riot. Harley Quinn doesnt seem to have any personality of her own outside of how other people want to use her. Shes just a prop here. Even Deadshots characterization is a mess. He turns into the movies villain when he helps a large group of dangerous supervillains escape prison presumably killing a number of soldiers in the process for no other reason than they dont want to be in jail anymore. How is he any better than the Joker?Also why does Amanda Waller think a prison filled with dangerous supervillains is the best place to set a trap for the Joker? Why does she inject a bomb in his neck? Why doesnt she just shoot him? Why didnt she put a bomb in Harleys neck? Why does Deadshot treat finding out theres a bomb in his neck as such a betrayal? Why does he feel lied to? Did Waller tell him there wasnt one? Why does he not think she will take it out when the mission is over? Do the other prisoners know they have a bomb in their necks? Do they get ever have the bombs removed? Where are the DCEUs other heroes during all this? Batman doesnt keep his thumb on the Jokers activities?

With an Omega level host which is an exception to the rule. Cable was purposely burning himself out so he could martyr himself so he definitely has a bodily limit. Ulysses doesnt appear to be a telepath in any capacity.gtWhich telepaths get burned out by there powers? Name a few. Because I cant think of a single telepath who has succumbed to their powers over time.Cable is the prime example. Chamber was a weird case but he would count. There are cases of other Alpha mutants like Xavier having their powers injure them like Joseph. The point is there are no old telepaths.gtNo he was still very very young. In the beginning of DoFP he was still in his prime so its not supported.I said the end. In the present. Hes already greying.gtYes there would. Old Man Logan is a spin off where healing factors are dropped down immensely for everyone especially Hulk who cant regenerate nearly as much as he should be able to. But even then he was able to survive a beating from the Hulk and hours of digestion as well as live  more years into the future after the act.

In a less corny way hed get up from the table etc. as Clone security come in and try to restrain him and he throws them around like nothing.Then it would cut to the Emperor with one of his advisers in some kind of observation room as the emperor looks on pleased laughing at having gained a new apprentice who has survived and now fully embraced his fear and pain.,fixingmovies,dezn7me,42,t5_3bqjz
