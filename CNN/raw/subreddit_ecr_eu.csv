1592236,0,t1_cjfukjy,I think more PG is more common because people just dont know and thats what most shops stock back when I first tried vaping everything was PGVG  I think in this regard the US is a bit ahead of us  the liquids from there seem a lot more complex as well.

Obviously we should have known better. But we got a few returns of the product because it was leaky. We spent all the time and money making our eliquids as awesome as we could knowing wed attract customers with quality cheap product. But the shitty ecigs just upset everyone. Had to compensate them with stock to make up for it.Anyway never again  we now carry an ecig thats got a much better battery life. So far no returns! Yet lol,ecr_eu,ckuwrbm,3,t5_32hcd

2140411,0,t1_clbg2jr,Ive ordered some sample bottles ml per bobble of  different flavors all of them except piper mint so i cant tell you anything about them. Theyre expensive at   bottle but you get free international shipping i wish that more US vendors could do that delivery time was about  days. My main reason for ordering directly was that I couldnt find a single EU vendor which had sample sizes of all flavours in mg in stock.The descriptions on the website are quite accurate just remember theyre kinda like what pipe tobacco should be. Imho it never taste overwhelmingly like tobacco.In general clouds are good vape is very smooth theyre all max VGIve tried them all in mg so your experience may vary.Long Bottom LeafA slightly malty taste not to sweet. From all l ive tried the one that tastes closest to pipe tobacco got a slightly bitter note.Shire maltVery similar to Long Bottom Leaf but sweeter and whit a distinctive maltinessOak Barrel CiderThe name fits it tastes like apple cider. Even the oak barrel is there. I didnt enjoy it but im no cider drinker.Sweet Georgia PeachWell its tobacco with peach. Imho the peach could be stronger.Kentucky BluegrassDescribed as blueberry tobacco. To me it had kind of a flowery note. Maybe a bit of lavender? Not very sweet. This juice was not what i imagined it to be but its nonetheless pretty good.Grandpas Cough MedicineNow this one is very difficult to describe. Kind of a very spicy chai tea. Not your usual tobacco flavor but very yummy.My personal favorites are LBF SM and GCM just ordered some more bottles of them. The other  where good too but just not all day vapes for me.Tasting referencesIve tried them all in a Kayfun Lite vaping at W. The power really changes the flavors so at W it tastes different than on W.Even better when dripped of course.I also tried some Shire Malt in an EVOD .Ohms but its not really enjoyable there. The VG doesnt wick well with the Kanger coils.I hope this helps you deciding. But I really really recommend to just buy some samples and try them yourself.,ecr_eu,clbw6gm,2,t5_32hcd

2379746,0,t3_2mnbjd,Theres two main reasons why you should always torch your wire. The first is that it reduces springyness and stiffens the wire. This will make it easier for you to wrap consistent wraps that dont spring back and deform.Secondly and arguably more importantly you torch it to get rid off impurities. Theres everything from machine oil to outright glue on kanthal when you buy it. Many factories and outlets use glue to keep the kanthal on the roll. Torching the kanthal will remove all of that at a safe distance from your atty.EDIT swickwire,ecr_eu,cm5ufgd,1,t5_32hcd

Samsung r are a great battery and have a a pulse limit which can be sustained for less than a second but it hasnt gone boom or got hot. At the very very most assuming you have a very good mech with seriously low resistance then you probably dumped less than a through it. Seeing as it hasnt gone boom over discharged or anything the battery should be fine. The situation wasnt safe and things couldve vented if the button was held for too long but when they test the pulse ratings they throw those pulses at the battery a hell of a lot more than just the once like you pulsed it.

All very very flavorful.You should look into getting a chamber reducer and a second top cap for your RSST. The chamber reducer will intensify the flavor and the new top cap will let you try the stock airflow. Still the RSST is just okay as far as gennies  go.

2960307,0,t1_co3wqt0,I do not agree for several reasons.The market value of a product is strongly related to its usage. You consume cl  ml of whisky in  mins while lot of vapers consume the same amount of liquid in a week. Moreover the ml of eliquid usually substitutes a consumable cigarettes that costs  euro.I think that in these costs we never take into account that the ejuice market is a relatively new ecosystem often managed by small companies or one guy that are inefficient have to buy back a recent initial investment have to experiment to develop new products share a small market and have no capillary distribution.Personally I spend around  euro on premium juices each month. I consider this an investment. I know that Im not paying for the consumable material e.g. vgpgflavours. I pay to keep highly remunerable the ejuice market thus that even small figures can be attracted and develop their new juices that possibly I will find exquisite.,ecr_eu,co4ln9t,1,t5_32hcd

The juice burns clean flavour is what it should be and I havent noticed any weird additives neither in flavour sensation nor gunk. Heres some of examples.Red hot cinnamon  I loved it closest Ive come to the hot cinnamon candy we all know and.. love?Gummi bear  Absolutely delicious. ml vanished in less than a week. Still not sure how that happened.Grape juice  Its more candy grape than juice but its fresh sweet and a bit tart.Israel Coffee  Instant coffee the charcoal black roasted variety. But it does taste like coffee which I love.Mothers milk  McDonalds strawberry milkshake. Pretty much spot on.Now let me give you the flipside.Israel Coffee  My friend literally gagged on it and refused to ever touch it again.Cotton candy  I found it absolutely revolting. Flowing sugary mess. But my better half really enjoyed it.Cola  I drink massive amounts of cola. This isnt cola. This is.. perfumy terribleness.Bananut  This isnt to be confused with banana nut bread which I thought was ok. This one though it just tasted off from start to finish.Ive tried many more but the main point is that if you dont like something then you can just toss it and youre only out a buck or so.

4186529,0,t3_38sfx6, If youre satisfied with the vape from your W setup then dont feel pressured to throw money at an upgrade. Sounds like youve already convinced yourself you dont need to. Your iStick  may not last out the year or it might keep going but why not wait until you know you need something new. If you do dont get an iStick W. I say this as an iStick  owner who has had no problems with mine but long term the reliability and quality of this model is questionable and some have had serious problems. Id go for the new Innokin Coolfire  W better quality and will cope comfortably with . ohm tank coils.   Subohm means direct lung inhaling mostly. Have you tried that style of vaping at higher power maybe on a friends or a shop demo? It doesnt suit everyone who is used to mouthtolung. Some people like it straight away.    Yes your juice consumption will increase. Mine doubled when I moved on to my first subohm tank.  Nic about the same because I dropped from mg to mg.  Higher power and lower resistance delivers more nicotine in each inhale so you drop the nic level of the juice. ,ecr_eu,crxgs7w,3,t5_32hcd

I now tried to only put half the wick in the juice channels and put the rest of it UP instead of on top of the juice channels. This helps with more throughput. Still have to see how well it holds up.My only gripe is that taking it apart for rewicking is quite annoying because of the nut and I use pliers to do it.

4994173,0,t3_3jaylw,With a budget of  you have a wide variety of choices to get you started. As you have a larger budget Id skip the pen style ecigarettes as they tend to be more trouble than theyre worth and itd be better to just skip that stage and go straight to the good stuff.My list of recommendations for a beginnerintermediate is Subox Kit with  LG HG Batteries While not necessary its recommended you buy an external charger for the batteries. This is slightly out of your budget but as you said around  Ive decided to include it. This device is currently the holy grail of starter kits for new vapers as its not only reliable but offers replaceable batteries easy to use even has written on each replacable coil the watts to set it as and includes a deck to build your own coils should you wish to do so in the future. Ive been vaping for over three years and this kit is what i use daily. Innokin Distrupter Paired with Subtank Mini or Nautilus Mini. Innokin is one of the most reliable brands in the ecig market and there only let down was that all the mods they made had nonremovable batteries. While these dont accept any old batteries they use Innokins own style batteries which allow you to easily replace them and USB charge them. The mod looks pretty stylish as well to boot. Innokin MVP . Pro Starter Kit  Solid device will last you a while. The only downside is that it has a nonremoveable battery which once it dies the mod dies with it. That said it should last you  months. This used to be my default boxmod i would recommend beginners to get who wanted to upgrade from egoblu style ecigs. Its built like a brick with the best battery life out of anything on this list.If youd like to go slightly cheaper then id look at Innokin Coolfire  with a Nautilus Mini tank. The coolfire is made from Innokin so should be highly reliable its a very nice starter build.You have the option of going even further down the budget line to the iStick w paired with a Nautilus Mini or Subtank Mini but the iStick is a budget device and may not last you as long it really is worth spending a little more for a Innokin brand battery or the subox.As far as the tanks go both the Subtank Mini comes with the subox and the Nautilus Mini have replaceable coils. If you buy the subox kit it comes with a . coil and a . coil. What i recommend to new vapers is to try the . coil first then once thats gone try the . coil and then order a pack of replaceable coils in the resistance you preferred rather than buying the coils on your first order.Any questions free free to ask ill be on and off reddit all day.,ecr_eu,cunzfia,1,t5_32hcd

All in all I would change your gauge of wire to increase surface area for the same ohms.

Either that or you had to short the entire fuse.It still happens in some use cases its just that its equally rare to the apparent autofire in the iStick .Also yes the DNA  was a step up device.

However the lack of stores could be a good thing if you think about it. It could be that those stores have had the juices they sell tested it could be that they have went through a lot of administration to keep that store open. But from not living or from there this is just speculation from my point of view. They are few shops over in Britain that are a bit iffy some places I wouldnt touch with a  foot barge pole.

Add top fill to that and it beats the nautilus on all fronts.Another option would be the Joyetech Cubis with . ohm coils.

Becomes a lot more viable since the quote is up to kg we only charge cost for shipping mind! The way couriers  work is the more shipped the cheaper the quote so the more people buying the more I can put the price down on shipping too.

10906276,0,t1_de4ve3u,If its stopping you from taking up smoking its a net benefit for sure. Research on this is still sparse but it seems pretty clear that some people gain benefits from nicotine that outweigh any risk for them and its much much better that they start off with ecigs than tobacco. Nicotine itself is probably about as harmful as caffeine so not something we should be unduly concerned about.We know from longterm studies that NRT is much safer than smoking and this study suggests that ecigs are as safe as NRT for the those things they measured. Itll take decades to find out what actually happens to vapers in the longterm by definition! but there are no serious causes for concern and plenty of reasons to predict that health risks are minimal. Lots of scaremongering but thats not the same thing at all. Most of the scare stories dont check out and this study confirms a lot of good news from previous research.,ecr_eu,de4wlcy,2,t5_32hcd
