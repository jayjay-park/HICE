786506,0,t1_cgtjdpr,Spot on Paper  we will have trouble getting the IPOs to escrow their holding but the very fact of the initiative gives us a genuine tactical leverage pump n dumpers wouldnt do this. You are right to mention education. We are thinking of the WhaleWatching and general education as being two sides of the same coin.My partner is itchin to develop a coin. I think it over and over there are just so many coins at present regardless of how things pan out.However . . . what about an invitationonly coin? It would be tinycap like the Franko. No premine. With a cash development fund. The community and devs would be of an utterly unparelleled quality.Turn away from the scree please take on offence this stuff needs to be saidthe denizens of the cryptosphere are overally oriented to the Net. and I betcha a beer that a survey would reveal at least three or four times the average of individuals  males  suffering from conditions on the autism spectrum. Its a matter of diminishing returns Paper. Only so many zillion pinkdildo and actualtumblingdice gamingsites can be effective. Someone writing of Dogecoin used the term transactional currency meaning that Doge is being used far more so as a currency than a speculative instrument.Well its time for crypto folk to turn away from the screen and socially viralise cryptos by signing up friends and family and coworkers.Merged development and alliance same thing. Whoops.Mark,NobleCoin,cgtohik,1,t5_2zok3
