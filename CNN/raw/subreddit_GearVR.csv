2356063,0,t1_cm2ry9t,I have heard the Samsung controller is not so great from other posters on this subreddit.  Also it looks way to small for my big hands to hold on to.  So I just got the Moga Pro Power from Best Buy and so far it is almost just as fluid and responsive as my XBOX PC game pad.  The Moga looks like it has a much better ergonomic configuration compared to the Samsung controller.  I played Ravensword for  hours straight and it worked great. Highly recommended.  ,GearVR,cm2x5af,2,t5_32ho6

2634602,0,t3_2q3gdf,When watching movies I tend to get great battery life only draining about  of battery within  hours and no heat warnings.When playing Shooting Showdown  I can usually only play about  minutes before I get a heat warning andor the game freezes. Proton Pulse is another one thats prone to overheating. Most others seem to be fine.Be careful when selecting a controller. Just because a Bluetooth controller will work with Android that doesnt necessarily mean its buttons are mapped to what the developers have designed for. The mobile SDK only recommends the Moga Pro as an alternative to the Samsung controller so to be safe that is the one you should get. However Ive seen that people who bought the Amazon Fire controller also have reported that it works just fine.And yes there is a MASSIVE difference between this and Cardboard. Every Cardboard setup Ive ever seen has a noticeable amount of latency.

Wanted to get back to you before tomorrows weekly releases. In short I will buy this game for  if you give the option for customizable controls. I love that you want the levers to behave like real machines on construction sites and im sure plenty of operators will appreciate the attention to detail. That being said I used to play Battlefield literally everyday for years years and years until they made it so you couldnt customize your controls to mimic the schemes of the original games which caused me to stop playing the game altogether. As you know I really like your game but I do have to say some of the controls are not intuitive. Im going to private message you with exactly what Id like from the full game when you release to a marketplace.

3722112,0,t3_32vpiv,re the  vertical horizontal horizontal blah blah.Nobody here has quite described it correctly and unfortunately it is something that gets confused more often than it should.The angle of view for a full sphere is actually  x . You cant actually get more than that it defies mathematics. Think about how you tilt your head to see stuff.You need to spin around a full  degrees horizontally to see the entire horizon but you dont need to tilt your head higher than  degrees up or  degrees down a total of  degrees.If you tilted your head  degrees then youd be looking behind you upside down and your neck would be broken.Instead to look  degrees vertical you actually turn horizontal  degrees looking behind you.So a full sphere is x.Now as we get into everyone trying to sell VR cameras in the future were going to run into the marketing crowd will fail to understand these things and start saying x degrees. Its important to know thats not a real thing that its just marketing.It seems comfortable to think that  degrees vertical means full sphere unfortunately its not actually correct. If you recorded  degrees vertical youd end up with a double recording of everything.tldr A full sphere is x degrees you cant get more than that.,GearVR,cqgjpf1,1,t5_32ho6

I have not really explored the note  because VR for S came out so quickly i jumped straight to that and did not bother rooting the note .

A D movie can go as high as  MBs if your phone can play it.  So even if you resolution is only p ratcheting up the data speed closer to the speed of the original movie youre ripping then youll get a nice clear movie.  But the blacks will still have black smear and it will still crawl across your film whenever you turn your head ruining immersion slightly.

But heres where they could actually use it for Android.  Android is cool and all and its efficient so Im sure they could code their engine in Android and let it become the defacto rendering engine for Android.  And it would make Android supreme too. I never doubted the software was real not vaporware or some BS but actually valid.  I believe their claims I just dont see the entire industry being upended over it no matter how good it is.  Its like asking every car owner in the world to throw out their cars because theres a better car.  Better car or not it aint happening.  Theyll drive what they have until it isnt any good anymore and then adopt the new car when they have to.

5252656,0,t1_cvj4fn5,Yes. Run down of my ownership experience is....Note  with Gear VR.S with Gear VRS Edge with gear VRNote  with NGear VR using cardboard appNote  with s Gear vr curently have a couple of units for S and one is with the phoneplate unscrewed and have taped it against the parts at end of the focus wheel mechanism as well as as using it taped with the phone plate but unscrewing the entire USB part so that is not there and the note  sits flat nicelyNote  i was first annoyed that the pixels were annoying while watching cinema and videos.I loved the immersive feeling and it was my first encounter with VR.Straight away got the S and loved the pixels being smaller meaning faces were not looking blanked out like the Note . However there were parts i hated which turned me off it. They were that when using the S the lenses on the VR seem to have a tint which you notice when you look at the edgeds of the lenses in VR. Makes you feel like plastic is on the lenses or a film. Really annoying. The worst part is that you feel like you are looking through a hole into a vr world. The immersive feeling that blew me away with note  is completely gone. So due to that the note  i much rather over the S.Now i have the note  I have used it with my devices and the screendoor effect is still there but it has ppi higher than the note  and supprisingly and maybe for other reasons it actually looks a touch clearer but the FOV is perfect. It is wide and it is long. So much better than the S. The edge screen is a little narrower and i do not want to accept any less real estate on FOV so will stick with note . Also from a detailed review I have found tyhat most websites say the screens are the same but they are not. There is ppi more with the note  it is wider and it is brighter than the sedgeplus.I also believe that Samsung may have improved the lenses making the screendoor less on the consumer to come. In Sumarry the note  has more FOV real estate than the S and S edge  and even if it is only a fraction i want all i can get. Another annoyance witht he edge models is that the side of the phone is so thin that i always found the palm of my thumb touching the screen which would stop me being able to type or it would close an app or move the cursor. I found no way around this and traded my edge for a s without edge.The s ppi is actually ratehr high for the size of the screen. it is about ppi ppi higher than the note  which is ppi lower than the note. The difference is huge when it comes to people in the background in cinema or peoples faces in the cinema.The loss of FOV though is dramatic and because of that as you feel like you are looking through a submarine periscope or a plane windo into the vr room versus feeling immersed and actually inside the vr room. This feeling that you lose with the S actually translated to me into note using it as much and not using it for very long. With the note  Gear vr i can watch  or four shows in a row or a couple of movies in a row because i get lost int he vr space. With the s though i feel like a visitor looking through a window and cant spend much time in it. Actually i put my vr down for two months until i got the desktop streaming to my Gear VR which i had to allow myself to enjoy of course.Hope this info will help you,GearVR,cvj4td9,1,t5_32ho6

After longer sessions it would squeeze my nostrils so that I couldnt breathe right and this is with the vrcover.com.  Now I dont have that problem because even with the phone on it doesnt weigh enough for it to squeeze down on my nose.  Also its really easy to put it on and take it off because of that back plastic piece not being there. Feels more like putting on a baseball cap now.  Also I would get fogging whenever I first put on the IE for the day whether cold or warm in my house. Eventually after  minutes fog would disappear but so far I havent see an ounce of fog.  Not to say it cant happen but its great I havent experienced any yet.One thing I do notice that was also present on the IE but not as bad is light bleeding into the headset.  It shouldnt be an issue in a dark room but in a lit one you will see it and also the fact the inner part is white now instead of black makes it worse.

6042823,0,t3_3y8kb9,There is indeed a difference between low resolution and blurry but I think a lot of people use those two words for the same thing. Videos in Gear VR and specially D  ones simply do look very low res. You can hardly recognize faces unless they are close.You can check if the focus is right by focusing no pun intended on the so called screen door effect if you can clearly see the black lines between the pixels or if you can clearY see each pixel then your focus is okay. You will then just have to get used to or accept... the SDE and the low res blurry quality. Thats just how it is.

Some could be better.Content Theres less of it on Gear VR but what is there is far higher quality.But Gear VRs main advantages are two things you didnt ask about. Head movement latency and motion blur.When you move your head around in Cardboard theres a noticeable lag. Thats because the motion is relying on the phones sensors which only run at  Hz. When you move your head around in Gear VR there is nearly no noticeable lag. Thats because the motion relies on the sensors in the Gear VR itself which run at  Hz. So the motion is X as smooth.When you move your head around in Gear VR edit Cardboard there is a very noticeable motion blur. Thats because the frames are updated in whats called Full Persistence. Without getting too technical Gear VR utilizes a display technology called Low Persistence which effectively eliminates that motion blur.,GearVR,cys4l8m,3,t5_32ho6

People pay at least that much to go see a movie which doesnt last any longer than most of these games. You also have to expect to pay more as an early adopter too  the economies of scale really dont work yet.That said I have more disposable income than most people so I totally get that its not as easy for some people to shell out the money as it is for me even if it is a fairly small amount. ,GearVR,czfksu1,2,t5_32ho6

It works almost as well as doing the meditation in perfect beach as a means of winding down after a long day. I guess it could just be the soothing ocean sounds though. Several people Ive demoed it with also feel that using the Gear VR seems to relax them after just using it for about fifteen minutes no matter which apps they tried. I think it might be a combination of slight eye strain mixed with the feeling of being closed off and immersed in a dream like state.

6421100,0,t3_43kki6,This game has a great intro animation and I thought it was going to be so cool.  But all you do is spin around as fast as humanly possible standing in one place like  of your game time is spinning around.  I got dizzy after  minute but not from VR from spinning around.  Plus it was impossible to hit the spheres to the music I guess I have no rhythm or whatever.  Because obviously you played this game further than the st level which I could not.  Plus I lost interest in this game after  minutes of spinning around and getting dizzy.  Plus its not very deep stereoscopic effect.  I like that they got Cymatic Bruce to be a character in the game I like his YouTube channel and that he works for AltSpaceVR now.  But beyond that it has no play value for me.  I found it pretty boring.  Im sorry I dont love the game you love.  I wish I did.  I really like your review though it almost makes me want to try it again.

6427462,0,t3_43pqcr,I had the Note and Innovator Edition which I sold last summer. And now I have a SConsumer Edition.I would say that its largely a similar experience.Although the Consumer Edition Gear VR is cheaper its also not as good as the Innovator Edition IMO due to a more flimsy and scratchy face foam white plastic on the insite which noticeably bounces light and a wider not so enclosed fitting it is made to fit glasses so if you wear glasses you better get this version.The FOV seems indeed smaller.The screendooreffect is still noticeable and will be for as long as there are no k displays out there but also noticable better than on the Note .You will still have black smear when you look around.But in the end all those points are negligible IMO. Because if you want to have a lightweight good performing no overheating VR headset with a brilliant HDDisplay  you dont want mobile VR now.Its all still in its infancy and if you cannot live with the downsides its probably not for you. It all depends on personal preferences and I love my Gear VR. Even with all its downsides. Btw. try Ocean Rift.

6618384,0,t1_d03uzig,It might be a mistake to not have a new Gear if for no other reason then USBC and phone shape. Honestly it would be silly to tie their phone specdesign based soley on a  accessory. I think we got lucky in the case of the S in the sense that its essentially a re release of the S. I think by the fall well have a much wider amount of user feedback and insight into what GoogleAppleLG or whoever else jumps in the ring this year have up their sleeves and it would be smart on Samsungs part to make sure they keep up on features and design in order to maintain the lead they have now. If they DONT have a new Gear for the Note  that would mean they have to wait for spring  to release a redisgn and by then it may be too late for people that have switched to other solutions. ,GearVR,d03wbuq,2,t5_32ho6

6683593,0,t3_476yjq,im not sure yet. i saw the new s in person last week and from a style and screen resolution perspective youre in the clear. i believe resolution is identical to the  predecessors and form factor is largely the same. i do believe the VR headset will accommodate both thanks to some nifty engineering. however the proof will be in the pudding. Samsung was telling us about more horsepower under the hood of the Ss when compared to the S and battery life seems like the biggest improvement from the old to the new. What im really looking forward to testing out  as many people who are familiar with Gear VR will be  is cooling. Anyone with a current GearVR setup will know about the cooling issues and how they can effect performance. Youve probably seen some of the mods kicking around this forum and the lengths people will go to extend duration and performance when the phone gets hot. The S actually has some form of water cooling. watercooling has a huge impact on PC performance when implemented on that platform and the hope is that it will give an equal boost to S duration while gaming or being used in the GearVR. We shall see. It wasnt easy to see the benefits in the hourlong demo they gave us last week especially since so much of my attention was given to the Gear  camera which is fucking amazing btw. So yeah. it sounds like you may be getting the shaft a bit in battery life performance and duration but you can rest your hat on the fact that what you see in VR will look the same whether youre on the  or the . ,GearVR,d0an4gm,1,t5_32ho6

Possibly even with nonmoving game.I know from my own experience that a up or down rotated camera makes me sick even if the camera is on a tripod and not moving.The reason is kind of logical. Your eyes tell your brain a different story than the vestibular system. The eyes have priority so the brain estaminates the vestibular system to be sick poisoned or damaged.Of course anyone who has no problems with motion sickness ever will have no problem with a bedmode either.And of course in the future the Headsets will tell the vestibular system that you are upright even in bedmode and that yu just lean to a soft wall with your back.

Can you not do development with the standard one you can get at Best Buy?The regular one that sells at Best Buy is fine.gt Why does the Samsung documentation seem to imply that I need both an S AND a Note  for development?  You only need one phone. You dont need a Note  they probably didnt update their instructions.gt I usually do development work within Linux but it seems that isnt really an option here?You should be able to install UnityD on Linux but can you build and push to VR?...I dont know but I would think you could.

7429564,0,t1_d2moczz,gt Also i dont buy that Gear VR is mainstream Rift is not theory Gear VR isnt really any cheaper than the PC headsets considering that you need buy a premium Samsung phone to use it.GearVR wasnt even mainstream until the S Preorders because people just wanted the S and not necessarily the GearVR. They got the GearVR for free making it widely available to the average consumer due to how popular galaxy phones already are. They were getting the phone anyways and got VR for no cost which made their entries into VR cheap whereas the average consumer doesnt have the money to buy a  computer and a  minimum priced VR headset. Theres not much overlap in what the average consumer was already going to pay for and what they need to pay for to enter VR on the PC whereas there was high overlap for the S.People are already buying phones because having a phone is practically a necessity these days and its already on the mainstream market whereas highend gaming PCs and  VR headsets are way out of the way in terms of the mainstream market. You can deny it all you want but right now the average consumer is much more likely to have a GearVR than a PC VR headset whos market is currently dominated by enthusiasts.,GearVR,d2mp00y,2,t5_32ho6

The screen door effect where you can see a thin black outline between pixels because of the headset blowing up phone screen pixels to many times their regular size is a constant in all Gear VR devices currently.I dont know if specialised devices like the Rift or Vive also have the same problem but all mobile phones that support the Gear VR in the near future are likely to have it and I would suspect that at the very least any HMD that doesnt have its own onboard dedicated and specialist screens will exhibit the same effect.That said while you typically notice it the second or third time you use a Gear VR you also stop noticing it nearly as quickly once youre playing or watching something on it.,GearVR,d2uj0w6,2,t5_32ho6

7877910,0,t1_d41dsf8,JT I pretty strongly feel that you build as few sets as possible. I find that artificial things that you can get away with on a film set you cant get away with in VR. Even though the resolution is so much worse theres artificiality its a lot more apparent. That being said there was some stuff towards the end that we couldnt do without building sets because it was underground so when we had to you just build it as realistically as possible. Luis In every possible direction.  degrees of it. Like a real thing.Rachel Yeah its different than if you build a set for anything else where you want to leave the top off of the set to give yourself room to put the camera. You cant think about it that way so if youre gonna build a set it has to be fully enclosed. So its good for claustrophobic settings that weve maybe fabricated like the scientists have but its better to just shoot in practical locations I think for all the little nooks and crannies and details that people catch. ,GearVR,d41jsyi,4,t5_32ho6

The obvious solution is to release the steel shackles they have on the software and let anybody with basic scripting knowledge write their own UI and share them. Immediately there would be multiple better alternatives and oculus wouldnt even have to go to the effort of building them.But oculus doesnt want to do that. Their priorities are not creating a genuinely good interface.

Ultimately the experience of having a headset that is completely untethered and doesnt require an expensive PC is absolutely a better experience than PC based VR its just going to take some serious time for mobile VR hardware to really catch up in terms of quality but I do believe it wins for widespread adoption and impact over PCconsole VR.

9282856,0,t1_d8rr0s8,gt Mind linking that stuff?Its firsthand knowledge.gt Because Ive read the opposite. Optics are the same except for being slightly largerThe optical sweet spot is noticeably larger.  And the lenses are a little further away from your eyes which helps with fogging and is better for people who need to wear glasses too.gt FOV was increased by less than  degrees.The FOV isnt actually substantially different at all if you wear both headsets tight enough to maximize it.  I think SamsungOculus are being liberal with their definition of FOV.Smaller . phones also sit a little offcenter in the  gear VR at least in the  samples that I tried anyway which can be somewhat irritating if you do in fact wear it tight enough that your FOV ends up being limited by the edges of the display.gt The new color is blackblue to reduce reflections but I have the white s and dont see any reflections as is.You probably dont know that theyre there because you dont know what it looks like when theyre not.On the phone side of the optics there is a white plastic ring that forms part of the lens retention mechanism.  That reflects light particularly when the display is producing a lot of it and it causes peripheral ghosting which kinda masquerades as a peripheral aberration.  Even my S Innovator Edition Gear VR which has lenses that are the same size is better in this respect because everything is black.find me a camera lens that has a large white retaining ring for any of its lens elements and Ill show you a camera lens that no serious photographer would ever buy  but I doubt youd find one and for good reasongt USB is true for external storage but still wont allow a tethered connection to PC so its mostly worthless.Not just external storage but all sorts of external peripherals.

9422518,0,t1_d9aagin,I dont think this uses cameras at all. Thats not how your phone tracks movement for example. Thats not how gearvr works either. It has an accelerometer that detects acceleration. You can stick your head in a bag in a dark room and gearvr will detect rotation just fine. Think of how you feel when youre in a plane that takes off. You can feel the fact that youre accelerating right? I think thats what theyre doing here. Theyre simply doing it better than gear to the point that they can usefully detect a full range of motion.If thats the case theres probably nothing stopping them from using the same method in hand controls. ,GearVR,d9adar6,-1,t5_32ho6

I only played the first one A Chair in a room I think it was called. Very creepy. The game elements were a nice change from most scenario type games but not really challenging.

10947915,0,t3_5wbjrc,I have to say that Im quite disappointed by the report that there is not even a minor FOV increase.  The current large Gear VR phones render a little bit beyond the edges of the utilized screen area which is why mods like this work.  So a minor design tweak should be all that is necessary in order to boost the FOV a little for larger devices.  Smaller devices would then have their FOV limited to the same extent that they currently do but by the edges of their displays instead of the edges of the Gear VR.If I was determined to remain hopeful I might choose to leave room for the possibility that the listed FOV spec is in fact a minimum rather than a maximum and that the Gear VR design has in fact been tweaked.  But in reality I fear that this might be another missed opportunity to capitalize on some additional potential without penalizing smaller devices with respect to their existing capabilities.,GearVR,de977i8,2,t5_32ho6

11131400,0,t3_5ywdaz,Hmmm...Ive been on Android  now for a couple of weeks and have not experienced any of these screen tearing or freezing issues that you mention with Pigasus. When you say freezing is the entire app freezing or just the video that youre trying to stream? The only issue that Ive come across to date that has effected Pigasus on Android  has been the Android  custom lib loading issue which Ive been aware of for a long time now which is now fixed and some dumb linking incompatibility issue with one of the Oculus driver libraries and Android  but only effecting some phones. Ive since also uploaded a temporary patch for this latter issue until Oculus fixes that library which Ive been assured by dev support will be in the next driver release some time next week.So Ive just played around with the screen resolution settings on Android  setting is back and forth between WQHD and FHD and vice versa and then trying to launch Oculus Home and managed to produce some sort of screen tearing effect like what is mentioned in this thread Is this what your are seeing? The screen tearing Im seeing is present not only in Pigasus but also in Oculus Home Oculus Cinema etc. However a restart of my phone quickly cleared that up and Im not seeing it anymore.Is anyone else experiencing tearing or freezing issues specific to Pigasus only since the Android  update?,GearVR,detqfwy,2,t5_32ho6

11682279,0,t1_dgk6u3f,There are a number of other players making OLED displays these days so Samsung do in fact have some competition.  AU Optronics for example made a p RGB OLED display for the RazerSensics HDK HMD back in mid .  So theres definitely some activity.In fact Samsung demoed a prototype . K AMOLED display early last year.  And more recently they even demoed a prototype K display.  But the target products for these displays seem to be standalone VR headsets rather than mobile phones for now.    The thing about standalone or tethered is that you dont necessarily need the displays to last quite so long because they generally wont see the same power on times nor will they need to be operated at peak brightness or even close to it.  Its also OK for them to be more expensive because the whole costing equation for VR is different and yields dont need to be as high either at least not initially because you wont need to be pumping them out at the same rate as mobile phones.,GearVR,dgk7blf,1,t5_32ho6

11778287,0,t1_dgv2tu3,Fillfactor is overrated in my opinion.  You can increase the resolution while keeping the subpixel fillfactor the same and still reduce the SDE.  And if you keep going youll eventually completely eliminate it.  This is because beyond a certain point the space between the pixels andor subpixels becomes imperceptible even if as a percentage of total display area it remains the same.  And improving the SDE in this manner also improves detail resolution.  And even if you cant drive all the additional pixels and end up upsampling instead youre still improving aliasing and reducing subpixel visibility as distinct from the SDE.Take a look at this image      Its a macro shot of a diamond pentile AMOLED display as Im sure you recognized straight away.  Pay careful attention to the apparent subpixel fillfactor.  In the brighter parts of the image it seems to approach . Is it because of camera shake?  No.  The fill factor plummets in the areas that transition to black.  Its just that when those little LEDs are pumping out a lot of light they tend to look bigger than they really are and this effect is present during use as well.  So why do we still see an SDE?  Because even with a  fill factor there is still too much separation between the red subpixels and the blue subpixels.  And the only way to properly solve that problem is to put a greater number of smaller subpixels in the same space.  ,GearVR,dgv3u3x,1,t5_32ho6
