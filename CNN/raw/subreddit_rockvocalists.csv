119061,0,t1_cerrike,What bands were you listening to that had a lot of screaming?  I went through a metalcore phase  years ago and screamed a little for fun but never did it enough to cause any harm.What really can get to my voice are the high notes like you said.  One of the hardest parts is accepting that my head voice isnt going to sound very good at first.  I always try to manipulate it to sound better in which case I start pulling chest or singing with my throat or something.  Thankfully I recently discovered the feeling of an open relaxed throat and it really helps with the tone and stamina of my high notes.,rockvocalists,cerzlr6,1,t5_2zqvx
