8418007,0,t3_4uns37,Actually with update  depth accessories drop in the last three Third World missions Melancholy Angel Headhunter Generation War. Also the rates are higher in Mantis Hatchery which is easy to spam but Generation War is faster. So no point buying from vendor unless youre really unluckyimpatient. But this method you need all equip  depth.Labyrinth is the easiest way. Just sit in HQ and spam LF Lab carry all day like everyone else.,HeroWarz,d5tslin,1,t5_3bvbw
