My thought is that maybe its a TN monitor all of which seem to be notorious for looking horrible. So probably any IPS monitor would do.Also What do you plan to use it for? What size are you thinking about? What other monitors do you currently have? More information would be helpful. Something to think about in terms of size is trying to get approximately the same pixel density. If you currently have a  p screen you might not want to get a p  screen. Same resolution but pixel density is way lower so the mouse is way further up or down depending on how you set it up when you move over to the other monitor. Its not terribly hard to get used to it if you just want it for desktop use but it would be horrible for gaming.,Monitors,ch8ylg5,1,t5_2ts2a

2587989,0,t3_2peqt2,I have the  p Asus MXh monitor. I cannot claim that it is best for gaming as I have not much to compare it to and I am sure that there exists a more responsive higher Hz lower input lag monitor on the market. What I can tell you is that I enjoy this monitor a lot. I primarily play competitively several FPS games such as CSGO and BF along with games from other genres such as Grid  racing. This monitor claims to have a response time of ms I think and either  or Hz. Unsure you can look up specs if curious. According to this website the total response time is .ms. You can find monitors that are more competitive. But I am content with this and do not feel a serious detriment to my gaming.Also it has very thin bezels that minimize the impact on desk and make it easy to use multiple of these monitors side by side. If you plan to get several monitors I would highly recommend looking at monitors with thin bezels. I enjoy using a monitor of this size  and cannot imagine going back to using a smaller monitor again. Whether for work gaming or just reddit larger screen estate is a huge bonus IMO.Anyways good luck on your monitor purchasing.

The screens in phones and tablets are true OLED panels but are only used in mobile devices since even with the limited use and power savings of these devices they degrade notably over a couple of years.semperverus  the tech has amazing response times equalling plasma or CRT and if the panels were ready for consumer monitors youd be able to have as many hz as the input board could handle as well as strobing to combat motion blur.

Its not much more expensive and it give you flexibility as most dual monitor stands max out at  or  inch screens. At that point you cant maneuver anyway when arms are fully extended. Personally I recommend this one. Its sturdy and I think curve is better for articulation with larger screens. The mounts slide on the curved arms so you can bring the screens closer together.

Any GPU can use VSunc but it only works at the refresh rate of the monitor. So if the monitor is running at hz there will not be frame tearing. If it runs at  or less it can introduce frame tearing. GSync and Free Sync dont suffer from these issues.  They can eliminate tearing at less than the monitors refresh rate although the lower limit varies depending on which particular monitor youre using.

Because to be honest at p there are not many games you can reach fps with without losing lots of visuals which imo makes it pointless to play at said resolution i have a x and i run most games at ultra p with fxaa. I get between  on the most demanding games but my god does it look good. So i guess its up to you if you only play games like CSGO and want crazy high refresh rates id go for a higher one but if you are like me and play all sorts this is definitely a good monitor to go for.,Monitors,cqzhq2r,1,t5_2ts2a

4176186,0,t3_38msqk,I bought the exact one in your link and for about the same price. Ive been happy with it so far. I game on it with a GTX  and run everything on the highest settings at p fps. I have not overclocked yet. I havent noticed any dead pixels on mine thank goodness. Everything about the monitors build quality is complete crap though. The plastic build material the bezels and the god awful stand are horrible quality but I bought it for the screen quality and I think its worth. I have to emphasize that the stand really is the worst Ive ever seen. I ditched it in favor of this monitor arm and completely worth the purchase. If you do get a monitor arm like this be REALLY careful when screwing the arm to the VESA mount. I guess I put apparently too much torque when driving the screw into the VESA mounting holes of the monitor and the retaining bolt thats on the inside of the mount broke off! I think the screws that came with the monitor arm were just a little too big for the holes in the monitor which is why I may have over torqued the one due to the tight fit the monitor did not come with screws for its own VESA mount. This post isnt mine but it describes exactly what I did. I ended up taking the monitor apart and actually taking off all the retaining bolts from the inside what you screw into from the outside. I then bought separate bolts washers and nuts and drove them out from the inside the monitor so I had about an . inches of bolts sticking out of the four VESA holes. I could now attach the arm over the bolt threads and use wing nuts to anchor it all together. I was actually pretty happy with the job I did and as ghetto as it was I think it actually turned out to be much stronger and more stable than the original. It turned out the retaining bolts on the inside of the monitor where you screw into from the outside where just glued to a metal retaining brace! The build quality of everything inside and out is just poor but for the screen itself I couldnt be happier. Its something Im pretty happy using for now until we get more pHz GSyncFreesync monitors beyond just the ASUS PGQ ROG Swift and they become reasonable in price. ,Monitors,crwahhk,2,t5_2ts2a

Running something that looks nice  but has less demands  like skyrim ltmoddedgt looks better on the TN. If you have a fantastic rig that  is almost magical. It is very hard to say which is my favorite but it is fun to play with both. If you want consistency I suggest running the same monitor.

4360975,0,t3_3ayrn6,.  Resolution.  Get something that your system can reliably push fps to in most cases.  Most monitors are in  aspect ratios like x p or x p but some people like Ultrawide monitors in  ratios.. Response time.  Faster is better but manufacturers often list graytogray values which tend to not represent actual performance.  Check reviews for good info like on tftcentral. Generally less than ms is fine for gaming if you arent playing competitive fastpaced games at a high level.. Panel technology. Most commonly IPS vs PLS vs TN vs VA all have ups and downs.  Most are TN or IPS.  TN has better response time and is cheaper IPS has much better looking colors and viewing angles.  PLS is like a faster version of IPS and VA is known for very deep blacks.  Refresh rate.   of monitors are Hz.  Other common refresh rates are Hz Hz and Hz.  Higher refresh rate makes all motion smoother and may reduce eye strain in some people.  If being used for gaming higher refresh rate allows higher fps to be displayed by the monitor but this requires extra graphics power.  Also check to see if certain inputs must be used for high refresh rates on the monitor youre considering.  Adapters can also cause problems with highrefresh rate monitors so try to avoid them when possible.. Extras.  VESA mount capabilities input selections onscreen displays built in speakers usually the shittiest speakers ever USB hubs stand adjustments blur reduction LightboostULMB GSYNC or Freesync etc.Generally all of this boils down to a few categories.  Cheapest is Hz TN monitors.  Next is Hz IPS monitors.  Then Hz P TN then p TN and IPS.  There are a select few p Hz monitors in both TN and IPS currently available but for quite high prices,Monitors,csh7rx4,17,t5_2ts2a
4368894,0,t3_3b13h7,p on a p monitor looks worse than on a p monitor the monitor itself will also be more expensive. That said p looks better on a p monitor than a p monitor so it will really depend on the game.This is due to scaling. p on a p monitor is obviously  but on a p monitor scaling is involved which can never be perfect. This degrades the image. If you wanted to splash out on a k monitor that is exactly  times the resolution of p and would look exactly the same as on a p monitor.My recommendation would be to get a p Hz IPS monitor as that will get the best possible display from your Xbox One.

Most monitors these days come with either gsync or freesync.Second you wont find a p hz monitor for less than  unless you buy korean knockoffs. The XGHU is the cheapest  hz monitor but it is a TN.

I havent had any trouble with viewing angles either no hue or tint or brightnesscontrast issues unless youre about  degrees or more and why the hell would you do anything from that angle?Bottom line unless youre doing photo editing or something else where perfect color reproduction is paramount there is zero reason to spend the extra  dollars for an IPS monitor most of which are currently plagued with quality issues anyway,Monitors,d0wsa5j,1,t5_2ts2a

The only way you can see the difference is if you stand in a remote place alone and turn your camera fast. Then you see the hz but in actual gameplay there is nothing. The ms vs ms is unnoticeable in MMOs didnt see a difference even in Unreal Tournament Alpha youd have to focus very hard on the screen to see something which made me tired pretty fast I dont play for a salary do it for joy rather.Also WoW wont handle fps in raids ever not the last time I checked the game when youre questing sure but where it matters you wont reach it. Usually im MMOs no matter what gpu you have you cant reach fps in raids at least in final fantasy  I saw GTXti scores and they reached below fps on maxed settings.

I honestly dont know. . While I have a few racing games I wouldnt be fully looking to play them in multiscreen. The multiple displays would be to have things playing in the background while playing certain games. Every once in a blue moon Ill play a game that requires grinding and I always enjoy having a streamshow playing in the background to pass time by quicker. . I do play a few FPS games along with MOBAs but Im honestly not sure if I would or wouldnt. Anything would be an improvement over what I currently have gaming wise haha. . I guess I already answered this in number  but to answer again I love multitasking based on what Im doing. Something that I currently do is split two browsers on my screen in half. One will have a movieshowstream on and the other will have a guideRedditetc open while Im playing a handheld game.. Another one I cant really answer as Ive never even tried a higher resolution over x before Ive been using TVs for years.

It is also relatively cheap compared to what Nvidia owners must pay for a similar package. Out of the box it sports a Freesync range of hz which fits the  pretty well since it should do about fps in games at p. Not in every new game nor with every setting and AA on ultra and you may as well turn off Freesync for fps CSGO but generally speaking. In my opinion p is more enjoyable than having all graphical settings on ultra in the vast majority of games.If you upgrade to a faster card in the future or if youre way past fps but not quite at fps the MGQ can also be modified for a hz Freesync range so you can utilize the high refresh rate fully.That also applies to the TN alternatives. They are cheaper have the full Freesync range out of the box and have no IPS glow but youll have the less vivid colors and color shifting of the TN panel plus the panel coating is hazier.If higher framerates are more your thing the Viewsonic XG is what you should get. If youd rather aim for steady framerates and the lower price point of a hz monitor there are the popular  p monitors like the Acer GHU or you could get one of the monitors with the great  p panel like the HP XW at an even lower price and use AMDs VSR for image quality.Edit also check out the Lenovo YF p  hz and HP Pavilion  p  hz online when they come out hopefully later this month or early next. Both are VA which gives you great contrast and a more paintinglike quality to the image with mostly the compromise of a slow blackgtother color transition response time. Also both have Freesync,Monitors,d4c975o,2,t5_2ts2a

This means a bit more power consumption in idle standby but it will ensure that the EDID of the attached device will be shown permanently in windows. This will eliminate issues when switching the AVR onoff but in my case it still flickered when switching the attached monitor onoff. Well better than nothing I guess.Also If you only need stereo sound in games you can also use an analog connection jackgtcinch or an SPDIF cable from PC to the AVR. But if you want true . or . with  or  independent channels you have to stick to HDMIDisplayPort. Surround over optical cable is only  channels that get upmixed by DTS or Dolby Algorithms.

According to the german HP Envy s YKAAABB listing which should be the same it has Bis zu  Milliarden untersttzte Farben durch FRCTechnologiewhich translates to Up to . billion colors supported through FRC technology so it looks like its definitely bit  frc ... everything else would be a bit weirdnot a question but I stumbled across that video  ... doesnt look that stable and a bit wobbly ... could be interesting for you Jay. Hopefully you get one now and can tell us your thoughts  Im still  sure that Ill buy it when its available because of the glass front the good design and reasonable price. The only thing that this display series misses is a HDR version. LG is going to present K HDR monitors next month so this will feel kinda outdated a bit but considering that LGs monitors will probably have anti matte coating again and that the envy is glossy and true HDR would probably really pump up the price its still a good choice.

See this video for example.  Please be very careful is you disassemble your monitor  even when not connected to the mains they can hold significant charge. If you have any doubt better let a professional have a look  no monitor is worth harming yourself.

10536154,0,t3_5qtyeu,Id grab the LG UD. Has an IPS panel Freesync support and is only around K is a big mouthful for a ti. But looking at videos for the NFS and Fifa you mention it actually does allright as long as you dont mind running at fps. Of course I will still urge you to spend less on the monitor and save up for a new graphics card hence the relatively cheap LG. For  on sale occasionally the gb RX would give you much more power on tap and also let you use Freesync which helps a lot at k.Also technically it wouldnt be a terrible idea getting a really expensive GSync monitor for a ti if you exclusively play easy to run titles like CS  but considering the  markup for GSync alone and Freesync being available it rarely makes sense unless youre already using a medhighhigh end Nvidia card.,Monitors,dd2e15p,1,t5_2ts2a

There is basically no overhead rendering a desktop.Ive run two monitors for something like  years and never had a problem unless I was trying to watch a Twitch stream on one and play something on the other which would dip FPS a little.OP you generally choose your primary and secondary monitors and third fourth etc. if thats your thing and games typically open on the primary. Some games will have an option to let you switch monitors manually. I have my desktops set to extend i.e. the desktop extends over both monitors so I can swish windowsmy mouse between the two but you can set to mirror etc.Ive literally never even had to give this a thought.
