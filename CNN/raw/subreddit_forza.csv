546435,0,t1_cg23g8p,Instead of letting Playground Games shit all over the Forza franchise I think T should integrate free roamcircuit racingrally all in to one game either that or Playground games pull their finger out and build a proper game to fit in with FM. The driving in Horizon was a joke and that whole XGames event BS was really cheesey i only got as far as the demo with FH and as soon as i was racing against a plane i just viewed it as another kids Ken Block No offence to the guy or his supporters game gave up and got FM back out.Edit Just to add to my brash opinion of Playgrounds FH I was sorely disapointed by it and its a shame that they didnt take this opportunity to focus purely on the rally side of motorsports which would give us a game to coincide with Ts track racing in FM instead of some Test DriveDiRT  and onward wannabe game.

I also experienced a onetime audio problem during a top gear track race with the rubbish bins and what not where the car sounds were all chopped up and out of synch with what the car was doing. It was a big audio mess that I find difficult to describe in words. Seems like the audio in the game is really glitchy. And here I was thinking console games were practically bugfree!

2959691,0,t3_2tv8nj,I liked certain things better in FH but overall FH comes in ahead for me.  The rivals in FH were really fun.  At the time I thought they were ridiculous but I missed the humor in FH.I liked the brother who setup all the street races in FH.  Loved his quotes before the races Man youre like a gladiator you keep coming back for more!.  I also liked that the street races were more of an off the grid type thing.FH has too much off road racing.  Dont get me wrong I do enjoy it but Id prefer more to stay on the track.The music in FH was slightly better.  I love both soundtracks though so its not a huge deal.I live in Colorado so Im biased but liked the location better in FH.I think its unfair to compare nostalgia.  The title menu song for FH was just too perfect and it will always be the game I remember when playing my favorite racing series.Something else thats unfair to compare the graphics.  I cant see myself going back to FH but maybe Ill try sometime.I actually really like the road trip   races in one car setup better.  I feel like Im able to get a good feel for the car in that amount of time.I would give FH the nod for multiplayer but the roadtrips are way too valuable.  I just started playing online and while I can hold my own in regular races people seem to know shortcuts and I can never finish the roadtrips.  I think they should give you the option between single races and roadtrip championships.FH has so much more content.  This is the biggest edge to me.  It feels like theres so much more in it.The racing mechanics in FH feel way better.Either way its such an incredible series.

3431795,0,t3_2zhsj5,Ok I am not a tuner so let me chime in here with some other racing advice about being faster. I am a non technical guy so hopefully this will be helpful and you may find some thing to think about in one of my bullet points. The less you do with the controls the less chance of error. The slower you move the wheel the faster the car moves. Squeeze the brake pedal on and ease off. The less you turn the steering wheel the faster you will go. Keep steering movement to a minimum. Brake first  then downshift. Smooth is fast. It is better to go into a corner slow and come out fast rather than vice versa. The more time you spend with the front wheels pointed straight ahead  or near straight  and the throttle to the floor the faster you will be. The less time spent braking the faster you will be. The most important corner is the fastest one leading onto a straightaway Its better to brake into a corner to early than to late.Im sure you are looking for more tuning advice but I find sticking to these rules I close alot of gaps on the straighaways!,forza,cpjg8i0,0,t5_2rzao

After that gearing has a big impact but not nearly the impact as AWD and power. Lastly weight and tires. If you are using TCS then your personal ability has very negligible contribution.Do not use the Acceleration bar as an indicator of a good launch.

5140136,0,t1_cv55uqw,Sorry it took a while to reply but Ive measured my wheel and even with only about one thread of the tightening bolt screwed in the furthest the clamp would open up is right about  . I know youre not really looking to buy a stand but Ive included a couple pics of my homemade one to show a very simple option.Im posting on mobile so I apologize if the link doesnt work. But anyways as I said before I made it from scrap wood in just a couple hours and only had to buy about  dollars worth of hardware. Even buying the amount of wood used would only cost about another  dollars though. I used eye bolts and wing nuts so it can be folded or adjusted without tools. The top part can move up and down using the series of holes drilled on the sides to adjust for different couch levelspreferences. It folds at the bottom and without wheel attached is only about   thick so it can slide under many couches or just be tucked away in a closet. When I still had a couch at my old house this worked fantastically well as the bottom was just the right thickness to slide under the couch and be held down nice and solid so there was no movement and surprisingly little flex. There are no provisions for a pedal mount as at the time I also had carpet and a coffee table so that worked well enough. Now I have a futon no coffee table and hard flooring so Ill have to make an entirely new stand. But it sounds like something similar may work well for your application. Or you could just get some bigger clamps and a board to hang off the edge of the table if you want to go super simple.I dont go on rhockey much to be honest.

5203485,0,t3_3m5edy,Ive played Forza since FM back in  I think each one was an improvement from the next except for FM. I feel like  was rushed and lacked a lot of what us die hard fans enjoy. I bought it late on because when I heard it was launching with about half as much cars as FM and no Nordschleife I know now it came as free DLC I lost interest.Even having purchased FM a year after release it felt like a cash cow because nearly half the cars you could buy required you to spend real money on car packs so if you didnt keep up with the car packs you were looking at spending over  on cars of which only some I would use.Forza  to me is what Forza  should have been from what Ive played its awesome car physics seem to have been improved graphics that rain!? the car list is pretty big and Im happy with the selection of cars a tonne more tracks and the menu for buyingselecting cars has been improved one of my pet hates was that all the cars were just in one big line and you couldnt select a car by manufacturer... however searchable custom lobbys are still not back the auction house isnt there no storefront no gifting cars which was great for buying paints and tunes from people on the forum so to me it still lacks that multiplayer depth that Forza  held so well and thats what I really loved about it.Forza  lacks that vital component that Forza  amp  had with custom lobbys you cant just set up a lobby and call it Drift session or Cruise around Circuit de la Sarth theres nothing there anymore which connects racers with other racers based on similar interests unless of course you look for these lobbys on TwitchTV or reddit.This photo of our drift team back in  from Forza  shows just what we could achieve with public custom lobbys half the members in that photo were recruited from them now we have to do it on forums or here...Ill shut up now Forza  kicks ass and I cant wait to get some hours into it perhaps I just miss the glory days of multiplayer haha.,forza,cvd7ogi,1,t5_2rzao

5647489,0,t3_3sfm3b,The styling of this car is unique but thats where it ends. Did any of you guys try simulation driving this thing from the camera angle of within this car? Because Ive personally driven a Delorean in real life and can tell you everything about actually driving one is a horrifying experience.First of all seeing anything out the back window properly is enough to make your heart race the blind spots in these cars are also terrifying from my experience. The original speed gear box is also shit and these cars had no power steering. The weight was mostly in the back but I found that didnt make things much easier.I find the Delorean to be nice to look at thats it. Even in a simulation racer like Forza Id rather stay away from driving it. Not that it also matters in virtual reality but the gullwing doors are a frivolous pain in the ass. Forget squeezing this car into any small car spot at a mall or etc if you want to get the doors open. Parallel parking too close to any high curb is also a stupid idea too.Despite the typical nerdest fascination with gullwing doors they are stupidly impartical for every day life and can potentially be dangerous if you ever found yourself in a wreck upside down in a car with them.,forza,cwx4jgk,1,t5_2rzao

I was ahead so I could afford to loose some time by driving in higher gears and it saved me enough fuel to not pit an extra time. think I used  litres in  laps so it makes a great difference. Funny thing this was my first endurance race and I only thought about the tires completely forgot about fuel.

There are also cones at braking points and apexes. Weight transfer control is also very important. Using cars with soft suspension is good for learning about advanced driving techniques.

Dont get me wrong though I am loving the new addtions so far a  landcruiser?! AWESOME! A mk peoples jag? lush! but come awnnnn more new stuff the better.

They want to make simulators as close to the real thing as possible which is why they would have these adjustments. While an arcade game is mostly something you jump into to dick around in and have a lot of fun without putting a lot of realistic thought into about your driving lines.

8842220,0,t1_d7ap1rg,gtFor me personallyAnd yes it absolutely is in the sense that I refuse to play a game unless its running at a minimum of fps. Its just so much better feeling and looking for games. I dont get why MS and Sony are pushing resolution over fps . Particularly for FPS I cant play a competitive shooter at sub  because it just feels too laggy in my aim. For racing games I think you get a better sense of motion at fps and it does feel that bit more responsive.Also I believe there are people who are made sick by games running at low frame rates but I cant remember where I saw that.But my point ultimately is fps is better. No arguments.If I wanted a slideshow Id create one in Powerpoint.Edit By the way if you get the chance try a Hz monitor theyre better than youd think. If you cant tell the difference lucky you you wont have to turn down settings to get decent fps xp.,forza,d7apjqi,4,t5_2rzao

9118911,0,t1_d87wm3a,Thats the short and sweet of it yeah.  Just like in a real car the reason for negative camber is so that during a corner the tire lays down onto the road so youre using as much of the tires surface area as possible.  With too much negative camber the tire will never be able to lay down or if it does it will be abrupt and cause you to spin same goes for the other way with too little negative camber the tire will always be on its edge in a corner not flat.  With the front tires you can run a lot higher camber and castor because youll be countersteering meaning there isnt ever that much force on the sidewalls the rear tires cant do that though so you have to run just enough negative camber so that they sit into the corner smoothly.  ,forza,d87y1b8,2,t5_2rzao

Steam support is bad but they allow refunds at least. Origins customer support is a lot better.gtRegardless MS instantly refunded my Horizon  despite owning it since launch day and gave zero fuss so clearly their customer care is pretty great. Fair enough though then i dont see the point in mentioning we cant normally do this when they clearly do this more often.gtThe Windows Store has its issues but it is a viable platform and Horizon was poorly executed Gears has none of the issues proving the store is perfectly capable of delivering games on PC.

9533687,0,t3_5bg3uy,Completing events on your map whether they be races PR stunts bucket list challenges whatever will increase your fan count. As you reach certain thresholds of fans you can expand your festival sites and even pick new ones. Expanding a festival site will unlock more things to do in that region of the map and opening a new site will unlock things to do in an entirely new area of the map. Typically when you reach one of these milestones youll also get to pick a new car from a particular category Retro Saloons or Supercars for example and youll get that car either for free or at a discount.The game is very much openworld once you have an area unlocked you can do whatever tasks you like in whatever order you want.Your first barn find will usually become available after you open up your second festival site your first being Byron Bay. I recommend unlocking Drone Mode with your first skill point as that will allow you to explore an area and automatically mark points of interest on your map such as bonus boards and barn finds.,forza,d9o85t0,2,t5_2rzao

9641773,0,t3_5d2xxh,As others have pointed out yes its still a great game. Its missing a few things like auction house and wide body kits but the roads are better IMO. Theres a few more curvy roads and most of them are narrower in general than FH so you dont need quite as fast a car to have fun. I also think the cities and towns in FH are dramatically superior to the ones in FH. They have lots of tighter winding streets between castle walls and whatnot compared to the boring suburban stuff in FH.

Offroad tends to be a bit less clean and more chaotic because youre not on a relatively flat and paved surface but rather a more slippery surface with poorer grip plus bumps and obstacles.  Secondly it didnt seem to really cause any harm.  The contact was mainly just rubbing sidebyside.

Key areas like physics graphics handling have obviously improved in Horizon  and Horizon  but the series has gone way off the path and lost a lot of spirit and features.Horizon  had Better Event Ideas.  With themes.  Like Only cars that cost less than  and have been upgraded to A class or whatever.  A Peugeot race up a mountain.  Horizon  has the blueprint Tuner category but pages of car category themes dont have the curated flavor of Horizon .  FH had the mini cooper event flying through the park on cobblestones!  How did we lose this Italian Job flavor in Horizon  and ? Better Campaign Structure. Horizon  had a better structure and theme. The wristband thing was far better than the grindy soulless iterative thing in Horizon  and Horizon .  Horizon   Check off a hundred boxes on a menu.  Horizon   Check off  icons on your map. Better Leveling System.  You start at  and you try to get to ....meaning  Badass Driver At the Festival.  Perfect for a street racing game. They deleted this for Horizon  and  which are just soulless grinds from  to . Better Characters.  The boss rivals.  The writing wasnt so great but still its worth having these.  Horizon  has Midnight Races but youre racing an empty robot car without any character Better Guide Character specifically  Ali Howard.  This actor and his line readings were better than Ben FH and Ben Doing An Australian Accent FH Better Mechanic Character.  That nice old guy in Horizon  was great.  I fully support female mechanics but the writing and direction I will not say acting I am taking this to the top Ralph Fulton for the mechanic character in Horizon  was atrocious. Better Street Racing System.  A set of events clumped together.  More money this is key. Better Color Ambience than . The redrocky rocks and orange autumnal trees in Horizon  had a beautiful aura to it. Horizon  was also a beautiful vacationdestination to be in. They had a glow. Horizon  just seems grey and bland and even though its a pastiche of geographic variety all of these various regionsroads just seem worse to me than Horizon  and . Better World DesignGeometry than . Horizon  and  both had hairpin turns placed under the shadow of a huge overpass if I remember correctly. Great. Horizon  has nothing like this all the roads are samey. Better Painting Garage.  It felt like an actual garage with the radio going and people trying to look in the windows. Horizon  and Horizon   are like Glamor Mansion garages taking a page out of motorsport.... I dont think thats cool. A Better Beginning.  Your first car is an old Corrado.  Take it from there.  Yes!  Not some free lamborghinis Better Routes.  Horizon  had TWO extralarge megatracks Goliath and also Red Rock to Dam.  Horizon  and  only have a single large track each  Goliath.  This is not acceptable for an open world game that has so many possibilities for large tracks. Better Promo Missions or whatever they were called three assignments per festival hub?  Sometimes you had to drive to a spot and take a scenic picture using the camera.  Now in Horizon .....you just go to an exact spot on the map which is actually an icon trigger explicitly marked for you but a purple icon that says SCENIC SPOT HERE! and you press a button and it shows you the vista automatically.  How is this an improvement on taking our own photo as an assignment?  Maybe its just me but this is really nuts on a philosophical level of game design the new implementation is just so lazy and automatic and spoonfed its just plain bad cultural spirit. Better Decals.  OK I havent taken full stock for a comparison here but I just know the darn dolphin decal was in Horizon  and was not in Horizon  or .  What? Better Paintjob Search System.  Horizon  let you search for all paintjobs that matches your keyword search regardless of car model. That makes sense. In Horizon  and  you can only get keyword search hits for your currently equipped car. Makes no sense. Better Multiplayer Options.Horizon  had custom searchable public lobbies.  You could find a drift group at any hour of the day.  Deleted for Horizon  and . Better Marketplace.  Horizon  had a free market.  You could set ANY PRICE for anything.  Horizon  forces you to do an auction with a locked minimum starting price. Better Respect for the player.  Horizon  let you press a button to skip the corporate intro logo splash movies when you start up the game.  Horizon  and Horizon  force you to watch the logo movies every time.Horizon  polished up some important areas like the interface speed events are no longer locked to a specific class THIS IS HUGE and I well remember that Horizon  did not even have tuning.  So were good now in these areas and thats great.  I like all the Horizons.  One of my favorite games ever.  But a close comparison between Horizon  and  is actually really depressing and outrageous to me.  The driving feel in the newer games is better so I actually like driving in  and  more than Horizon  and Horizon  has the most beautiful and scenic and greatest driving roadselevationvillages.  But it is not even within the realm of dispute that Horizon  was a better videogame.Also...Im stunned that we are  games into Forza including  openworld games..and weve had no custom courseroute creator.,forza,dcp3579,2,t5_2rzao

Cutting corners willOnly help you if youre car is set up for it a strictly asphalt car will potentially lose a lot of control if you try to skip the corner but if you coast through the outside of the corner with the same asphalt car then youll be in a better position the accelerate after the turn. Not every car is good at every task. If you dont like cars going through he fields at mph then drop to a lower class and enjoy some less forgiving driving.

I would say the thing that took me the most to learn or get good at was throttle control with the triggers. It helped a lot to switch to manual. I started by doing a lot of circuit racing of FM because that was when I first bothered to buy something that I could play games on. And find a group of people to race with maybe.

We have a wild scene here in DFW. My friend recently sold his Gallardo TT I was joking about trading my house for it worth a bit more than his asking price and almost without hesitation sure I could use the garage space for some of the cars. I was kidding and the guy is just that cool about things. Most Ferrari owners lack much of a personality so in that way I find the correlation to be correct.,forza,dgnccm2,1,t5_2rzao
