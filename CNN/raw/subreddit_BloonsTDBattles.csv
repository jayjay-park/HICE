8771113,0,t1_d70rr0s,Not if you sell your farms. If you play correctly you should have at least  plantations on average  plantations by round . Just sell all your farms and you can afford a fanclub.

9722583,0,t1_dabi7cp,Well if its becoming an esport the most likely thing is that they will remove indoor pools since its quite short and not very enjoyable to watch over and over again. Also ov and molt will want appeal to the new community of sports players that would be likely to appear so rushing would seem more likely we may actually see rainbows being cheaper again if anything,BloonsTDBattles,dabir0h,2,t5_3c9x9
