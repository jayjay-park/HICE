1888691,0,t3_2g74qe,Ive had the thermostat for about two years and three Protects for almost one year now. The thermostat replaced a programmable model I had been using properly  I maintained a program based on our normal activities adjusting it throughout the year when we are home more during the holidays or in the summers when my wife is home with the kids. It worked well but there were always times when we would deviate from the schedule and it would run as if we were home even though we werent. Here comes the Nest...The first year it was ok. I let it learn our schedule and program itself and it did well but I was disappointed in the autoaway function. Ours is in the formal dining room which doesnt see much traffic so it wouldnt know if we were home or not. It would sometimes shut the system down when we were home but upstairs or in the basement for an extended time. Then came Protect. With one protect on each floor of our home and in a major traffic area the auto away began working amazingly well. One thing I believe is key is that we have a Protect right above the door to our garage so it really does seem to know when we leave and arrive. I also set my own program now instead of letting it learn on its own. It was easier to program than any other thermostat Ive had thanks to the app. I programmed it from my office one morning. Since the autoaway has really worked well and I set my own program our utility hills have absolutely dropped. We are using less electricity this summer than we have in any of the past four years since we moved into our home. Its great. Its also nice to be able to set the temp wherever you are like if youre heading home and you want it be warmcool already when you get there. Finally we have people house sit for us a few times a year and Ive been able to see when theyre actually here to some extent based on the auto away information in the app. One year we paid someone to housesit and take care of our dog and she was practically never in our home. It was good to know that so we didnt hire her this year. If I was looking today I would definitely consider the Honeywell that competes with Nest for two reasons. First they have relatively inexpensive sensors you can place around your home that work with the thermostat to maintain an average temperature. Our living room might be  in the winter but our basement sure isnt. Evening that out would be awesome. I hope they add this to the Protect at some point. And the other reason is Apple just announced that Honeywell is supporting their home automation platform. As a family with a bajillion Apple products that control tons of stuff throughout our home I find that interesting. TLDR the nest looks great saves us money and I would recommend it. Competition is better now though so I would check out Honeywell too. Good Luck!,Nest,ckgs1yy,4,t5_2trj7

2292290,0,t1_cluyy9r,I saw Life a couple of months back.  I have no interest in having one more bloated app on my phone and giving all my information to one more company I dont know.  Especially when I want it to do nothing more then see that a wifi connection was madesevered.  My thoughts are either it needs to be done by the Nest thermostat through Google since they own my soul at this point and I can trust them or through a tasker plugin.Ill look into the WallyHome sensor but as I said before I dont want another bloated appcompany.  These things should really just be integrated into a NestAndroid home if that will ever exist system where you can access all the relevant info and controls from a single interface after installation.,Nest,clv1kga,2,t5_2trj7
2520150,0,t1_cmetzbf,Got my WallyHome hub and  sensors in yesterday and immediately went to testing.My first impressions were great.  The sensors were smaller than I expected and even though I have not bridged both sides of my electrical system all the sensors were working in their locations.  Then I went to bed...Tonight I noticed that most of the sensors quit sending temperature data back to the hub.  So I went and started isolating them bringing them closer.  As I did I triggered a water event when the water sensor was touching my palm.  Now that event will not reset.  I also did a button event on  of them and the button event works but not temperature updates.I sent an email to support and hope they have some ideas.If I cant get the temperature thing worked out I wont be able to use these with the Nest.,Nest,cmnisqe,1,t5_2trj7

3150416,0,t3_2w8bhx,I wonder what the babysitter was smoking while the parents were out.  But seriously why would you post an article about a product like this with  data points?  One time I saw a smoke detector go off when my friend was cooking.  It happened at my house too once when my wife was cooking.  Another time it happened when there was no smoke at all.  None and I mean NONE of these smoke detectors were Nest models so that plus the content of this article leads me to conclude that all smoke detectors are terrible and should never be used anywhere.  As a side note I think the Nest Smoke alarms are are more expensive than theyre worth.  Im happy with my Nest Thermostat because I can do positive things like turn the heatAC on and off remotely but I just cant imagine living my life in such a way that I think a fire in my home is so likely that I have an internet connected device to keep me constantly aware of the status in that regard.  If they cost the same or maybe even x the price of a basic smoke alarm then perhaps but at x the price its just not worth it to me.  There could be situations where fire was more likely like at business where high temperature operations are commonplace but then I think Id probably use something more robust than a consumer level device. ,Nest,coojd75,6,t5_2trj7

Basically everywhere an existing smoke alarm already was I just did a direct replacement.And yes you set the room label of each individual unit from a predefined list in the setup app. When the smoke in my daughters room was detected every other unit in the house spoke up immediately and said that smoke was detected in the kids room.

10512083,0,t3_5q4n5x,Given youve seen it turn on when you walked past and  opening the app turned it on I suspect the thermostat thinks youre not at home.If you have a modern Android phone it could be preventing the Nest app from running in the background when the screen is off unless youve explicitly allowed the Nest app. So you could be checking your phone while some distance from your home which wakes everything up and the Nest app tells your thermostat youre not at home. Then the app is suspending so this location is never updated. If youre not walking past the thermostats sensors then it will still think youre miles away from home as it has no information to the contrary.When you subsequently walk past the thermostat it detects you and switches on.Or when you subsequently load the app it wakes up and updates its location and tells the thermostat youre at home.Also Nest will have learnt that youre often not at home according to your phone during these times.Youll need to turn off App Optimization for Nest and if you have a Samsung device also App Power Saving for it.Alternatively you can tell Nest not to use your phones location for HomeAway assist.,Nest,dcznn4u,1,t5_2trj7
