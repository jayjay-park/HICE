1813640,0,t1_ck7jf9i,Alright going to have to break out this veto now and save Laura.  The fact that she is being called boring especially when youre leaving other Caramoan people like Hope and Julia in makes me want you to rewatch this season.  There is a reason why she has a huge fan following as a castaway with huge potential who got shafted and otherwise could have shown her strategic prowess and could have easily been allstar material.So Im going to be a bit biased because Ive also hung out with Laura before and she is awesome.  She is one of the only true fans on this season which already buys her points in my book.   I love how she is another pretty girl on the season but was able to be cast by using her nerdier angle as someone who studied Arabic and was studying abroad in the Middle East.    Laura is extremely smart and savvy and definitely stands out from the shallow cool kids alliance  I mean she could have fit in with them if she wanted to but instead was much more shrewd as a player. So already I think she is more dynamic than the California recruits who offer nothing more than their looks.  Laura brought spark to an otherwise pretty dull and lame tribe through moments like calling out Reynold and his HII and was able to draw attention away from her by using her smarts and social skills despite being a weaker challenge liability.    She was able to build relationships with people like Sherri and SHAMAR  and god knows how anyone could get along with him.Laura got royally fucked by Shamar being eliminated and then being sent right to tribal council before the merge happened which I am sure would have been a big help to her as she would not been seen as a threat despite her game playing ability.   If Laura lasted one more day she could have added a great strategic dimension to this otherwise mediocre season no I dont think it is bottom tier like everyone else. Instead being weaker in challenges was her demise and strategic gameplay can only take you so far when your tribe needs some wins to keep you going.All in all Im saving Laura because she was the standout new contestant in my opinion and to see her finish th in a rankdown when there are vastly inferior people left would be simply wrong in my opinion.   So we still havent figured out how we are using our vetoes whoops? probably should and I may regret it if a bigger wrong is written but for now I cant see Laura go this early.,survivorrankdown2,ck7q29n,2,t5_332yz
