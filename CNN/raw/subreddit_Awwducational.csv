1033592,0,t1_chlrcj0,gt Yes the animal may have died but prior to that they lived a comfortable and healthy lifestyle.But does that justify our choice to kill them for something we dont need? Even if the animal did live a comfortable life which is very rare these days since most farms are factory farms even small family farms have had to step it up if they wanted to continue making money does that suddenly make it okay? If that rule was applied to humans would you still think the same? That also doesnt take into account the dairyegg industry where male calves and chicks are killed because they serve no purpose. This is the standard for every dairyegg farm in North America. The only way to make money off of cows is to take their milk and the only way to get the milk is to take away the calf. Cows have maternal instincts just as humans do and you can imagine how stressed and heartbroken they are when this happens. Do you really believe we have the right to separate mother and baby for milk? gt  everything I eat must be killed including plant matter but I dont consider that cruelYoure right something has to be killed in order for us to live but the twist is we have a choice. We can choose to kill only nonsentient plants or plants AND sentient animals. Its obvious which is the more compassionate option.Youre also right that we exploit resources but you have to know where to draw the line. Is it acceptable to exploit our fellow humans in order to collect resources? Most people would agree that it isnt. Why is it okay then to exploit animals who arent very different from us? gt Even Native Americans exploited the land and animalsThey hunted for survival but in todays society the only real hunting most of us do is through the grocery aisles. We didnt have a choice back then but now we do. Its time to evolve and become more compassionate as a species not only to our fellow humans but to everyone else too.

The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet.  Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or selfdefense climbing kneading or for extra traction on soft surfaces bedspreads thick rugs skin etc.. It is also possible to make a cooperative cat extend its claws by carefully pressing both the top and bottom of the paw. The curved claws can become entangled in carpet or thick fabric which can cause injury if the cat is unable to free itself.gtInteresting Cat | Cat communication | Polydactyl cat | Comparative anatomy Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcirzd oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecirzd.

If you are concerns about predators you could get one of those squirrel guards or a predator guard or make one yourself by wrapping some sheet metal around the post a few feet from the bottom of the bat house.

Bats are phenomenally diverse and occur in most terrestrial environments around the world. gtUnderstandably theyre often compared to birds and several bat groups  those that eat fruit and those that hunt insects and birds on the wing  are undeniably similar in ecology behaviour and some features of anatomy to some bird groups.gtBut in one very special respect bats and birds are remarkably different. Birds have evolved flightlessness on innumerable separate occasions. There are not only such classic flightless bird groups as penguins dodos ostriches emus kiwi and so on but also flightless ducks geese swans ibises cormorants grebes cranes rails auks falcons parrots and songbirds and this isnt a complete list.gtYet bats so far as we know have never evolved flightlessness despite a history that extends over more than  million years despite the invasion of island ecosystems where flightlessness in birds was incredibly common and despite an enormous amount of variation in size ecology and wing form.SourceMore info on batsMore info on birds,Awwducational,d3hmq91,44,t5_2vi0z

Therefore you can pull from that that cattle spend the majority of their time in feed lots which suck serious sausage sfw subreddit lolBut even if we decide we dont care about welfare which we should care about there is still climate change.

It observed that one of the guns that the plaintiff used was ultimately removed from useafter two years because inadequate air pressure often necessitated multiple shots to stun the animal.gtThe court recounted a particular incident in which the plaintiff was observed using the gun to drive a cow backwards by shooting it in the face. The result was that the animals right eye was missing and . . . it had also been shot below the left eye.See page  on operator error for more information on how ineffective humane methods of subduing the animals before slaughter is.  Theres also lots of information about how infrequently the laws are enforced either because of infrequent inspections or lax punishments for example  fine which is piss in a bucket for a major corporation.

11663640,0,t1_dghd3y8,gt  only an expert can provide.More like only someone who is REALLY dedicated and understands that owning a nondomesticated pet requires a substantial effort and life change.There are people who literally raised wolf cubs with their family. The family killed the cubs parents and then found the cubs and felt bad so they took them in. The MSM is like OMG YOUR KIDS WILL DIE. but the family is this magical thing called not retarded. The family understands that the wolves are ANIMALS that dont understand our made up SOCIETY and LAWS. Therefor the wolves are NEVER allowed to meet strangers... only the family. The family is their pack. Strangers are rivals and dangerous to an animal.The wolves have dozens if not hundreds of acres to wander around. So the animals biological needs are met and the familys expectations are realistic. Theyre not taking wolves on walks at WalMart or public parks. Theyre not treating them like cool dogs. Theyre treating them like wolves.And it works fine.So basically for  of people yeah the best in general advice is yours only an expert. But expert really just means Someone willing to put substantial time and effort into understanding. And  of people arent willing to put that effort in. Its not even like theyre bad people but they think I can do anything! and they can! but they dont realize maybe I dont want to do this. And if you dont want to do something properly and it involves another living animal just let it go and move on. You dont need to own every Cute thing like its some sort of Pokemon to be possessed.
