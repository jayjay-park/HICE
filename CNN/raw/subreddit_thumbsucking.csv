5853869,0,t1_cxmom19,Ah!  I should have known you would have been involved in the site Ive stumbled upon your comments all over the interwebz whenever TSing is brought up.It seems as though youve been a great champion of the cause for many years and an inspiration to many.  I know I speak for hundreds when I say thank you.I can certainly understand being too busy or lazy to be bothered with updates but Im very curious about data from your web survey and site traffic stats.  For years your site has been at the forefront in creating a public presence for a usually very private behavior and the statistics and statements gathered could be invaluable for future research. Have you thought about compiling and publishing a broad analysis of the data collected since the last update?  ,thumbsucking,cxmyxy6,1,t5_36f91
