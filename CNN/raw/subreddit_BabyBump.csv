2660943,0,t3_2qgoa9,I cant help with anything else but my symptoms are the same. They do say they start to get better close to the second trimester so maybe thats whats happening. I wouldnt worry untilunless you have spotting along with cramps. Also by cramps I mean doubledoverinpain cramps. Mild period  like cramps are normal as everything is stretching. Good luck and welcome!!,BabyBump,cn5wvng,1,t5_2ve9y

7278745,0,t3_3uetkn,My first two pregnancies ended in miscarriage. The first was  weeks and we found a baby with no heartbeat at my first ultrasound. I had a dampc. The second was early just  weeks and happened naturally. I was so afraid the third time I got pregnant.But my beautiful daughter was born a year after my second miscarriage. She was absolutely worth waiting for. I miss the other babies and wish I knew them but I cant imagine my life any different. Shes everything.Im now almost  weeks with a son. I feel beyond grateful to have a second baby on the way. Hang in there. I think the fear is normal but I told myself the same thing every day that i carried my daughter and now my son this is a new pregnancy. Every single day is a new day and a new chance to celebrate the baby. You cant let fear ruin any future pregnancies. Your cant let fear ruin your day to day before you get pregnant. Just dont let fear win. Life is too short.,BabyBump,d25jmbz,1,t5_2ve9y

9117866,0,t3_4t2nnj,I dont know anything about nexplanon sorry.  What I can tell you is that miscarriage while hard is extremely common. I had one earlier this year  and it was a missed miscarriage meaning my body kept on acting like the fetus was viable after demise. I feel better about it when I trust that my body knows how to make a baby and will bail if something goes wrong. My body knows whats best for me and the baby and just wants the best outcome.I can also tell you I know a woman who has been through  miscarriages and she has two beautiful little boys who are happy and healthy. Miscarriage is hard but it doesnt mean there wont be another chance or that you wont have fabulous kids.,BabyBump,d87tiu0,1,t5_2ve9y
10355131,0,t3_5nbjkc,Its a lot like playing the lottery. Every baby is different. Since  weeks my now mo has slept through the night. At first it freaked me out so Id stay awake as long as possible to make sure she was breathing. But now I take advantage. Although that  mo sleep regression hits like a gut punch and you basically hit reset and have to learn new ways to soothe her. But still down by  up at . I cant complain. ,BabyBump,dchtby2,1,t5_2ve9y
11082813,0,t3_5ommtv,Here is a link to my docs safe list of OTC meds. I used the exlax listed the other day and it was glorious. I took  before bed and by pm the next day I had a good movement. It didnt feel like the normal stimulant laxative. Its fairly gentle on your system. The only pain I felt was gas pain and I was already having that. I talked to my doc about the lastditch effort this week. She said it was fine that I took it. Obviously you dont want to make it habit but if all else fails you gotta do something. She then prescribed me prenatals with stool softeners in them. Hoping it gets better with that. Best of luck to you. I know how difficult it can be. ,BabyBump,deo86ml,1,t5_2ve9y
