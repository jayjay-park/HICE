2561224,0,t3_2p19by,IDK you did technically mess with his stuff without asking.  If you do actually have boundary issues and are constantly tweaking and messing with pretty much everything it might have been the last straw.  You yourself say he was polite in asking you to not play it while he sorts out his feelings you then say you know youre in the wrong but bring up something not related to the situation to try and point out hes unreasonable or something?   Then you ask if hes being unreasonable in this case and then ask if you were in the wrong even though you acknowledged you were. ... How about you just dont mess with other peoples stuff without asking?  Im not going to give you the pass youre looking for here. You need to figure out why its such a big deal to you that hes putting up boundaries for your fleas.,RBNGames,cmsw0qs,0,t5_34a32
3319829,0,t1_cp6okyr,LOL Ive been married for almost  years. The Husby and I play Catherine together. The main gameplay component is the puzzles as instead of fighting the monsters youre trying to outrun them in these weird puzzle dream sequences. But theres also a great complex storyline to frame it. I feel like Im not doing the game justice lol. Its very difficult to describe.,RBNGames,cp6ot9o,2,t5_34a32
