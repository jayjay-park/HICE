8412,0,t1_cefcovt,I thought it would be clear enough if I added subtitles but apparently not so let me spell it out clear here without any disturbing videogt Within the monetary system there are a lot of subsystems or institutions. For example you most often have a market a jurisdictional system and a government.This video was all about governance and in particular this segment was all about comparing governances in a monetary system systems that does use money and a ResourceBased Economy. Therefore its a good idea to look at monetary systems that does employ a government since thats the absolutely most common. There arent that many working monetary anarchosocieties out there even though they do exists at least in theory.I did not compare democracies and a ResourceBased Economy. In that regard I would certainly have mentioned that theres a subset of democracies that are not monetary systems in the video. If that was what I compared which is was not.Can a monetary governmental society move to become a nonmonetary governmental society? Yes of course. But that is a question about transition which I dont cover in this video.,thevenusproject,cefe6ph,1,t5_2sdrh

3733155,0,t1_cqhrpv8,Maintaining peace is always a selfish interest. At the end of the day us supporting the ideas of TVP will always be due to selfish interest. Retaliation from war is feared because we are starting to understand that other people arent just going to roll over and not act in their own selfinterest as well. As a result to act in everyones selfinterest peace is maintained. Selfinterest is not a bad thing and does not run contrary to the ideas of TVP.,thevenusproject,cqhsy44,1,t5_2sdrh

The idea of a resource based economy itself simply makes sense to me given the big technological leaps along with technological unemployment and the cultural unification going on.So is a matter of coming up with a more realistic plan.,thevenusproject,d6tvsdv,1,t5_2sdrh
