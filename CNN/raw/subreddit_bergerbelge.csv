However when she is being really picky shell end up just lapping up the milk and leaving the rest of the food   Mine is also pretty weird when it comes to her food.  When she was very young she would eat anything.  As she got older around a year or so she would eat only  meal a day if that even though I feed her x a day.  I found that she had very sensitive teeth due to illnesses when she was very young and had to get them taken care of. After that she would eat her food every time I put it down.  Lastly I simply suggest making sure she gets a good workout every day.  You said she is pretty activesociable with other people and dogs but her appetite will definitely increase if she has been running all day   Oh and of course check with your vet regarding her weight if you are really worried.,bergerbelge,cgf9o84,3,t5_2u0bo

2085703,0,t3_2ije76,Miami is overrun with BYB Malinois. Id guess shes purebred or close to it. A lot of dogs not so carefully bred or even responsibly bred working lines have oversized andor soft ears.,bergerbelge,cl4xsuj,2,t5_2u0bo
2112940,0,t3_2j4wv8,Background We adopted her  weeks ago and we were told that she was a german shepherd mix. We went on that assumption for a while until a friend suggested the groenendael breed. We looked into this a little and she was picked up just a couple hours away from a breeding kennel. Looking at videos the way the certified dogs run and play looks just like our beast. Any thoughts? Also ignore the costume my wife gets excited.,bergerbelge,cl8eeqi,1,t5_2u0bo
