263945,0,t1_cf7o3c0,I appreciate the comments. Personally I think the waterfall stands out plus the footage of the fire.About the wipe beforeafter I can see what you mean and I agree. Something I will surely keep in mind for next time! The skin tones is another good point. Something Ive heard about but havent really given a good thought. Will look that up and read about that in the coming days.Seems like I have got more things to read also. The difference between primary grading and secondary grading. My initial guess would be that secondary grading would be close to what make the blockbuster looks  something Ill have to read up and learn though.Thanks for the feedback! ,colorists,cf848ja,1,t5_2yis7

1525386,0,t3_2bmzlz,I used to love working with Color. But once I switched to Resolve Lite there was no turning back. Either export an xml from your edited timeline and color those files or color all your wanted footage in Resolve and then import and edit in Final Cut. There are lots of free Resolve tutorials that will get you up and running fast and even then you will barely scratch the surface of what it can do.,colorists,cj7hfwb,2,t5_2yis7
1813952,0,t3_2falbb,It is mostly a lower contrast possibly even a bit close to a log gamma and shifted towards yellow and red.  It looks to me this is mostly it because the reds in the background the whites and the blacks are all contaminated for lack of a better word by the yellowred cast.,colorists,ck7rfrt,4,t5_2yis7
2480517,0,t1_cmibucz,To be honest Ive never heard of Lustre and Baselight until you guys mentioned it. But Im not involved in the industry. I do find it interesting though.,colorists,cmicbax,1,t5_2yis7
2674380,0,t1_cn7m024,That doesnt explain how to fix already clipped highlights and youre describing a pretty standard process for grading a shot so to me it doesnt sound like you actually know the answer.If this was an extremely bad blow out I would mask out the sky and replace it. That is usually the work around but its overkill for something like this and in the real world you dont have infinite time for each shot. This stuff happens all the time with outdoor footage because its not a controlled environment. Even on really well shot reality TV thats outdoors theres still sometimes a blown out sky or some crushed blacks because the camera cant be stopped down more cant add more filters cant fix it with portable lights.. Its beside the point. Any grading I do I also check across multiple monitors types so if the sky looks super blown out to you I would try that and then recalibrate your screen or consider its not suitable for CC. Low grade screens just dont display the subtler ranges at the far ends of the value spectrum. ,colorists,cn7nw87,1,t5_2yis7

3204828,0,t1_cotzb99,Good results from an HSL in a still image ! good results from an HSL in motion. The effects of sensor noise over time and changes in light intensity  falloff on an object as it moves make these corrections substantially more complex in motion than in stills. ,colorists,cou6hbl,1,t5_2yis7
3207918,0,t1_cou7i3a,Yeah its a useful trick  though it doesnt always work. Sometimes you have to stack a few different keys to get a good result too which is better done in Nuke or AE and then exported as a luma matte to Resolve. Give it a try though sometimes its like magic.I mostly grade RED footage and I like it. My comment about blue channel noise isnt really a dig against them its just the nature of that sensor. Alexa footage is infinitely cleaner but I dont necessarily like it better than RED they each have their own looks though admittedly Dragon footage is starting from a better place than the Epic was.,colorists,couhzvf,1,t5_2yis7
3786455,0,t1_cqntgci,Thanks for trying. Maybe. Im not really familiar with xml at all. My dp mapped this xml process and i just went along because i dont know resolve. It SEEMS like it should be a solvable problem.,colorists,cqnvwam,0,t5_2yis7
3911401,0,t3_358sbq,Well your exports are proxies so once you edit in Premiere and export the XML back to Resolve and reconnect the original footage youll have the original footage to color correct again. So it doesnt really matter how your initial exports look since the public wont be seeing it and youll eventually discard them in favor of the original footage anyways. Or you could try editing  in Resolve. I had a pocket cinema camera project that I edited in Resolve last year and it wasnt too bad. I definitely still prefer Premiere for editing but if youre just sticking to edits without FX or graphics its totally possible to stay in Resolve. ,colorists,cr24vk3,4,t5_2yis7
3917567,0,t1_cr2t68c,That I do not know yet. Im right at home without the panel so Im not worried if thats the case.I didnt feel the submenus would be too hard to learn amongst the different panels but I wanted to hear as many opinions on the topic as possible. I didnt want to take my assumptions too far and later doom myself.Thanks for taking the time to put in your two cents.,colorists,cr2u746,1,t5_2yis7
4755218,0,t1_cttxmmj,Yeah thats a fair reason to not use it. From what Ive experienced its better to upgrade camera than use an external recorder on a d in  the compression on the video is just not worth spending more money on I will find some example videos and link them when Im not on mobile,colorists,cttxvg5,0,t5_2yis7
4848764,0,t3_3h9omi,Im not a pro colourist but heres some comments.It looks alright. I think one thing is Im not  clear what exactly you are aiming for when you say vintage. The colours of the grass and hay seem to play to that well enough.The issue is that in a shot or two the people you are shooting are shaded by the sunit is behind their backs and youve tried to balance that with the other shots where the sun is behind your back. It would almost be better to ditch those shots because it doesnt gel well.Also does one of the guys have a really red face? It looks too red and a little over saturated especially in the first shot. If Im guessing the time of vintage correctly youll have to remember that all the actors had makeup on so they would have been paler and thus more balanced with that kind of look.,colorists,cu5q0vi,1,t5_2yis7
5063685,0,t1_cuwbztm,Thank you thats very helpful! I ended up messing around and getting it as close as I could as the client wanted this done asap but I will certainly use your LUT tomorrow regardless and then maybe well have time to upload a second version. Thanks again!Also this is a very low budget project as you could probably guess by the state of the footage so your result is definitely close enough for rock and roll.,colorists,cuwd6km,1,t5_2yis7

5904398,0,t3_3w3kdr,Dynamic Link from Premiere gt AE do your AE work render out of AE as something lossless ProRes DPX etc. If youre grading RAW footage make sure you have a plan for gamma amp color space before baking anything into a render. In Premiere either. Keep a timeline without those Dynamic Links and export XML gt Resolve referencing all source clips. In Resolve replace the source clips tagged for VFX with the renders from AE. If you have embedded TC this is a pretty seamless process and very easy to version up later in Resolve if you keep making changes in AE.  OR . Replace those shots you sent to AE with new renders when the VFX work is done as udizzi says. Send an XML from Premiere gt Resolve referencing a mix of source clips and those finished renders. Update versions in Resolve as necessary wout going back to Premiere. I prefer method  because it allows a colorist to work on source footage before VFX is ready and even if Im the sole artist on a job I dont really care about having those rendered VFX shots in Premiere the final VFX plates are only useful to me at the next step in the pipeline which in this case is color. You should not need to render anything twice except for the VFX shots  once from AE after doing your VFX work once after grading along with all your other footage. and if youre using DPX or a nonchroma subsampled codec like ProRes for intermediates a few clip generations will have no measurable effect. Even subsampled codecs like ProRes wont show much realworld degradation over generations see page  here,colorists,cxtlmgo,6,t5_2yis7
7010181,0,t3_4bnr8o,Grab a still to the power grades section. Those carry over from project to project. I think the shortcut is like commandoptiong or something like that. Open the new project select one of your power grades then hover over the clip you want to apply it to and click your track wheel on your mouse usually called middle mouse button. Should drop the whole node tree. Can also be done to multiple clips by selecting all first. ,colorists,d1ay836,1,t5_2yis7
7428712,0,t1_d2mf7wf,Well what do you expect?  Its two images of a hand with a very dark grade without context I know this is just a test but it would have been more interesting if this was an actual scene and we saw multiple shots from the same scene with the same grade.My point is this post provided nothing of value for the subreddit to even discuss.Also I think you meant bit depthcolor depth.  Bitrate has little to nothing to do with color grading other than that you get a fairly nice crisp image with a high bitrate footage,colorists,d2mli8b,6,t5_2yis7

7995414,0,t1_d4e3soc,Thank you. I just set it to . It was at . Resolve crashed twice since doing this. Im starting to think that it may have to do with more people being connected to the server while grading. It SEEMS to crash less when only one computer is accessing the server but I swear its gotta be a bigger issue than that. It is really hurting us right now. ,colorists,d4erdyf,1,t5_2yis7

10718677,0,t1_ddli35c,Thank you thats exactly what I was looking for. I now feel like I know what Im talking about when discussing this. So basically just use your scopes to make sure its a technically good shot and no matter what you try to do with the colors you just dont have the image info to do anything with it?Im talking about doing things like trying to make it warmer or messing with the color saturation. I use premiere and thus lumetri...so those are the tools I have,colorists,ddljvvr,1,t5_2yis7
