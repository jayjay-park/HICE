46659,0,t1_cejnlti,look for Sparks listen for crackling. If it sparks or combusts on your nail Its underpurged.  If it crackles It could be either moisture in your oil or a little bit of butane still in the product. If your having difficulty getting a efficient purge down dont be afraid to raise your temperature by  degrees or so. Just dont go too far past f. Youll begin to lose terpenes that are relevant to the flavor amp aroma of your oil. You begin to lose terpenesTHC that are relevant to the high at about f as your product will begin to decarb. ,CannabisExtracts,cejqqz0,4,t5_2r341

Well why wouldnt you then get said reclaim out? Im not understanding your reasoning here you dont get people who waste oil yet conversely in my opinion by not salvaging that reclaim you are wasting oil. I think we can agree that the reason reclaim is emergency dabbage is due to the taste. I mean yeah if I had choice to dab some fresh CO extract versus what was sitting in my rig I would absolutely choose the fresh dabbage. But that said I wouldnt wash my rig out and then throw the contents down the drain. You talk about not wanting to waste dabbage yet it seems if you DONT salvage that reclaim then its a waste.

The DEA can say whatever they want but the courts have rulled otherwise.  gtFebruary   the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a unanimous decision in favor of the HIA in which Judge Betty Fletcher wrote They DEA cannot regulate naturallyoccurring THC not contained within or derived from marijuanai.e. nonpsychoactive hemp is not included in Schedule I. The DEA has no authority to regulate drugs that are not scheduled and it has not followed procedures required to schedule a substance.

307227,0,t1_cfcez83,Every other extractor out there uses a raindrop top flood design. This is where the butane is fed from the top of the column and collected at the bottom. The problem with this design is if you have any uneven or tight packing spots the butane will flow right past taking the path of least resistance thus resulting in lower yields. The bottom flood Terpenator design floods the column from the bottomup. This ensures the total volume of the column and plant material is FULLY consumed amp soaked in butane. ,CannabisExtracts,cfcm18l,5,t5_2r341

Ive heard good things about gentlemans brand atomizers the attachments you put on the battery that boil the extract. Personally I vape ecigs so I just modified a  ecig tank by wicking it with stainless steel mesh not silica.  Works great.  Basically as efficient as my rig.  Im sure that if you get a  EVOD tank you can just put a dab on the coil and vape like that.  Its literally the same thing as those more expensive  glass globe attachments. Also replacement heads for evods are under .  Edit  If you go the EVOD route when you take of the base you just need to pop of the chimney that sits over the coil and remove extra wicks they add on top of the coil to keep eliquid from flooding the tank.  You want to be able to see the coil and one silica wick that goes through it.  Place a dab on the coil put the top on the tank and take a hit. ,CannabisExtracts,cfevo0a,6,t5_2r341

It works well but you lose a little terpenes but Iso strips most of that anyway so it doesnt matter too much. Be sure the Pyrex is above the rim or the direct heat from the metal in the base of the pot can ignite the alcohol.

So this pill is gonna be about x stronger minus all the acetaminophen youd get from taking a similar dose in Percs youd be taking  mg of acetaminophen. To people that are in intense pain that have to dose like that multiple times a day that is just not viable since the recommended max amount of acetaminophen per day is  mg. And no smoking indica concentrates does not have the pain killing effect that opioids do no matter how much you want it to.

460391,0,t1_cfsl5ow,Like I said it sounds like you still need to do a lot of research before you can preform a safe good extraction. First off good ventilation will not cut it you need to be blasting outside otherwise you are risking an explosion. Secondly flames are the first thing you have to worry about but also things like sparks from electronics or anything like that its only one spark to ignite the butane and you are in a world of hurt. Lighter fuel wont work either you need to get the proper well refined variety of butane otherwise your oil will not only taste bad but also be very bad for you. You should only ever spray onto glass or a ptfe sheet. If you decide to have your dish heated while you blast it must be something without electricity like a hot water bath. Its only until gt of the butane has evaporated off and you see bubbling oil that it is ok to bring inside and put onto a heated surface that uses gas or electricity. Lastly airflow doesnt help at all with butane extractions its heat and vacuum thats it. ,CannabisExtracts,cfslhci,3,t5_2r341

There is actually no baking soda left in the final product if properly cooked. gt Once mixed and heated the bicarbonate breaks down into carbon dioxide and sodium carbonate which then reacts with the hydrochloride of the powder cocaine leaving cocaine as an oily free base. Once separated from the hydrochloride the cocaine alkaloid floats to the top of the now leftover liquid. It is at this point that the oil is picked up rapidly usually with a pin or long thin objectIMO Thus making it more pure then your average coke because anything it has been cut with is left behind in the cooking process.

If you are turning up the heat to  and vacuuming for longer of course you are going to get wax thats how its made properly that doesnt mean that you are making a better concentrate. You agree that you are losing terpenes with additional vaccing and you cant provide any sourcesnor does it matter at the ppm level that show that waxes have less butane than shatters do so waxes would end up being an inferior product than shatters not to mention taking twice as long to make.

Do you have a source for that?  What happens when it crosses the barrier in my mouth lungs or butthole?gtWhat happens is it hits faster because it skips the transformation into a different metabolite and goes to your brain as plain THC.Uh it hits faster because its in a more bioavailable form which increases peak plasma concentration.  Stonger effects in a shorter window.  It would still be metabolized by your liver.If what you described was actually true we could all just cheat drug tests by using it sublingually because it goes to your brain as straight thc.gt Nothing is degraded by the digestive tract in this context that statement is false.Absolutely it is and the membrane of your intestine isnt that good at absorbing.

1678874,0,t3_2dk3vr,Its not quite legal yet. The judgement was suspended for a year to allow the government to fix the laws to comply with the ruling and since it was a provincial it will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Heres some snippets from the trial lawyer Kirk Tousaw Facebook regarding legality. Check out his page for more info. gt . The decision is binding on trial level courts across Canada persuasive on provincial appellate courts.gt . The impact of the statement above is unclear because a the MMAR are no more b the remedy imposed by the BCCA was suspended for a year to let the government react.gt . What the government is required to do by this decision is not immediately clear to me. What they should do is immediately amend the MMPR andor CDSA to  make clear that patients can produce and possess cannabis derivative medicines and  allow LPs to produce and sell those medicines. gt . The government and Owen Smith are both entitled to appeal. Im not sure but believe that because it was not unanimous the SCC would have to take the case. No decisions have been made by either side at this point.gt . This decision does not allow LPs to makesell derivatives right now or possibly ever. Fundamentally as the decision was written it is about patient rights patient autonomy patient dignity.If you are specifically still in the MMAR then youre probably safe to make your weed butter or possibly a small vac oven setup ie personal use size. In the MMPR which is the new system where you have to buy overpriced weed through the mail you might have a better defense if youre busted but its still unclear. Also if youve taken precautions to minimize detection or just doing personal batches youll probably be okay.

2087868,0,t3_2isnls,one thing people are failing to explicitly mention but which is heavily implied is the fact that a dirty bong used for flowers will taste just like that a dirty bong used for flowers. if you dab from one of these pieces you will still get super high but its gonna be harsher and its gonna taste like an ashtray as well and you probably will lose a bit of the flavor in the gunk as well. clean piece with just water and some oil buildup from dabs wont do this and you will be in heaven. usually if you were a heavy flower head youre gonna have a larger bong if you were into smoking a lot. if this piece over filters its gonna still be great to have for when you are sick with a sore throat and need the smoothest hits but people are right that a smaller piece that doesnt overfilter will be better. they make large rigs specifically for oil heads taking huge hits that want to preserve flavor but those rigs tend to cost a lot. if yours overfilters consider using it later for an enail rig or for taking massive dabs only. if its pretty normal single downstem no percs then youre probably fine though. if you intend to continue smoking flowers id definitely get a second piece,CannabisExtracts,cl57pyl,1,t5_2r341

The goopiness is an intrinsic part of co extraction unless youre able to completely dry out the plant matter which would likely result in thermal degredation which is hardly better than acid catalyzed degredation.

When you do a quickwash you arent letting the chlorophyll sit in the solvent long enough. It isnt necessarily a bad thing either if youre going to be using the tincture for food products.

3590805,0,t3_31hfnw,I stayed in a cabin in colorado during spring break with an old furnace. I like having my shatter all in one slab. So with one strain that was like glass all broken up I put in on parchment paper and layed it on top of the furnace for like  minutes. It came out perfectly as one slab. Then later the same night after lots of dabbingdrinking I decided it was a good idea to do the same thing with another strain of shatter and put it on the furnace. Went to take another dab to wait  min and then passed out. I woke up the next morning and suddenly remembered the dab so I rushed to the furnace to see the wax bubbling and I quickly took it off. After it cooled down it looked like this after breaking it up a bit with a tool. The thing is I still smoked it all and it milked up wayyy more than just a normal dab before I fucked it up.

5932200,0,t1_cxx2k00,Thats very interesting so you and uFaxon both noticed fairly strong correlation between water content and buddering. I actually noticed that once I started heating my column during the final stage of my last run the inside of the column was noticeably humid I assume water leaving the buds. This humid material when processed was what led me to really start diving into prevention ideas. I will start with humidity tests tomorrow. In terms of speeding the test I will first try just wetting the product before final polish rather than my starting material. If this doent yield anything concrete I will dehydrate a run worth of buds in my oven and compare to hydrated run.In terms of dewaxing I have done the same material with and without cooling my solvent first. Keeping all other variables as close as possible I have normally seen increased stability with higher waxes.

6028814,0,t3_3xypes,So i have some questions for any potential experts out there. To anyone who has a grasp on the relationship between vacuum and various molecules relating to extraction cannabinoids  essential oils waxes  fats and any solvents used boiling points. Is the the effect of reduced atmospheric pressure on these molecules universally the same percentage of loss in boiling point across the board? Or does vacuum effect each molecule in a unique way based upon the different makeup? Also Im wondering if anyone has any info regarding what i have heard being referred to as hygroscopic terpenesterps that are more prone to pulling ho out of the surrounding enviroment than others a list of identified or studied terpenes with these characteristics would be helpful.Also i was told recently that when cannabinoids are decarbed the carboxyl group is cleaved off which creates more ho and co in the extract...this true? Also Ive been smoking different rosin from people making it and Im noticing a high frequency of tasting moldy notes in rosin. Would it be safe to assume that the use of solventswinterization and filtration allows for a more thorough separation of these spores bacteria unwanted lipids than does the process of quick heat and pressure through a screen as its done with rosin? Thanks in advance.,CannabisExtracts,cy9wb9s,2,t5_2r341

7353273,0,t3_4fw5dk,I could calculate the minuscule resulting heat from force or stress as you mention which is a branch of solid mechanics not thermo! Thermodynamics involves converting heat to shaft work and viceversa with great examples of devices being turbines compressors heat exchangers throttles condensers and examples of cycles such as refrigeration heat pumps too and heat engine steam power plant. Mass streams heat transfer and boundary work all contribute to the energy balance of a control volume while mass flow and heat transfer as well as entropy generation contribute to the change in entropy of the control volume. A constrained bar receives a thermal stress when it is heated and not allowed to expand. In the reverse if you stress a bar it will change temperature according to the same relation. Stress  Youngs modulus  alpha  change in temp.Alpha is the temperature expansion coefficient and for steel it is x ininF. Youngs modulus for steel is around . x. Lets say you have a  ton press which is  pounds and . inch square platens. The area is . squared so . inches. The normal stress is force per area so  pounds. inches squared is . psi.

Ive done that and it SUCKS but its TOTALLY AVOIDABLE! FUCK i felt so stupid but its just something to be mindful of give the metal time to cool between rips or dont hold it past red hot too long I get my bucket red hot then count  seconds slowly in my head then take my dab. I wait a minute or two and by then Im ready for my next dab and the titaniums mostly cooled off.Also consider getting a buffer downstem you dont mind losingbreaking. I have a cheapo downstem now that my bucket is plugged into that if it breaks whatever it was  bucks but my couple hundred dollar bong does not.Alternatively get an enail and control the exact temp of your hit.,CannabisExtracts,d4lah0d,2,t5_2r341

9841824,0,t3_5g8z9z,Its hard to say exactly because it depends on the current state of the concentrate in terms of strain stability moisture agitation and level of decarboxylation.  The technical potency will change along with its decarboxylation state.  It is possible to overdo that but youre talking relatively low intensity heat sources so an hour wont ruin it but heating it overnight could.The apparent potency might change along with its consistency but that is somewhat anecdotal.  Some people prefer sugary wax over shatter because it makes the terps more available.  Others want nothing except shatter.  Its largely about personal preference and sometimes practicality of handling.  For example one might be easier to load into a pen and another might be easier on a dab rig at home.Part of the result depends on the if the consistency is smooth or agitated.  If it had been folded or rolled into a ball and flattened it will have microscopic air bubbles trapped in it.  That creates accretion points around which terps can separate from THC and cause shatter or pullandsnap to become sugary or crumble.If you like shatter or pullandsnap then just leave it alone.  Anything you do will destabilize it to some extent.  I like sugar but not crumble so I have been having mixed results with my inability to predict exactly how it will come out.  For example I followed the same process with two different strains one sugared and one crumbled.  I dont know how much was about original moisture content and how much was difference in strain.,CannabisExtracts,daqev85,3,t5_2r341

11336588,0,t1_dfgyz27,Oh perfect now we are talking about my field of molecular biology. Yes Ive read every single paper talking about synergistic effects of terpenes with cannabinoids. They are highly misunderstood in the cannabind industry so if you have any questions I would love to answer them.For the most potent terpenes found in cannabis myrcene and limonene they have known therapeutic effects in humans. These are roughly in the range of mg per kg of weight. So for a guy weighing  pounds kg they would need g of myrcene to have any medical effect. In most cannabis plants monoterpenes the category of terpene that myrcene and limonene belong to are about  of the dry weight. So out of  gram its at most mg of monoterpene. So to get to that g dose you would need to smoke g of cannabis all consumed at a rate faster than the terpene would be metabolized. That isnt even hitting the major points that there is most likely NO synergistic effect because there is no allosteric binding site for terpenes on CBr or CBr and there is no overlap of downstream signaling between the cannabinoid receptors and endogenous terpeneresponding factors.So Ethan Russos major claims are baloney in terms of actual molecular mechanisms. Terpenes do smell pleasant though but its not enough of a factor for us to keep em.And yes we do COEdit can provide sources of course ,CannabisExtracts,dfgzdse,3,t5_2r341

11442890,0,t1_dfszt5q,Sirius extracts makes some pretty bomb RSO I would look in to their method. They have some video clips online showing their method I believe they even had a segment on a vice show. But it appears to just be a quick wash with grain alcohol and then cooking the alcohol out. You could just try doing an ounce like this and sending what you get out for testing. ,CannabisExtracts,dft1hop,5,t5_2r341

11619447,0,t1_dgcjsp5,Because as the side bar says we are not a catch all extractions sub.  It is most definitely not a sub for defining simple terms that can be easily googled.  Hate on me all you want but its pretty fucking clear.,CannabisExtracts,dgd2pq9,-9,t5_2r341
11624422,0,t1_dgdcv56,Oh Im sorry did I miss the other part of this post where there is an actual extraction related question?  All I see is someone looking for the answer to what live resin is.  And no Im not saying dont ask anymore questions Im saying there are better sources to find the answers like google and other subreddits that may be able to help more if google STILL isnt enough.  Its about keeping posts where they belong.  I have NOTHING against OP as a person.,CannabisExtracts,dgdn1p4,-1,t5_2r341

11703665,0,t3_66ybcf,A cclamp like this will be your best friend. but the bigger version that one looks small Bonus if you have some small aluminum or steel pieces to distrubte the load on the straightener in addition to the swivel pads on the clamp. I ended up epoxying one of the swivel pads onto the hair straightener I was using made things easier to hold while pressing.,CannabisExtracts,dgmmo15,2,t5_2r341

11780575,0,t1_dgvd44m,see when I try to have a discussion all these guys just run away.  with no argument to stand on.  no understanding of the rules of the side bar or the metarules or the word meta.  just insults about peoples hobbies and place of birth I believe thats called racism.  This sub has become sad because of people like ukmnman we used to be able to talk about extracts but now its filled with insults about whole generations of kids and whole races and even cutting deep into peoples hobbies to find things that willhurt them.  what a shame this guys job is to uphold the meta rules of this sub.,CannabisExtracts,dgvd6nl,0,t5_2r341
