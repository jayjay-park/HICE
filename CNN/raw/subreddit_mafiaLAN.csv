6069471,0,t1_cyf5k8c,Hey one thing i noticed about yesterdays stream is that the sound was much better when you guys used the mic in the middle of the room. It also took away all those i havent had a chance to get the mic excuses. Just an observation and suggestion,mafiaLAN,cyf73i3,6,t5_3bfq0
6070636,0,t1_cyfc9a4,They couldnt afford to mislynch he knew Nahaz was mafia they could have just lynched him and then do that shit next round.,mafiaLAN,cyfckc1,1,t5_3bfq0
6072310,0,t3_3ypx7g,Yeah no idea why Nahaz thinks owen won the game.,mafiaLAN,cyfkfh6,3,t5_3bfq0

6076361,0,t3_3yq8ah,It was soo hard not to burst out laughing at like  am in the morning here in the UK while everyone was asleep. that game was very entertaining to watch RIP Nahaz XDEdit i think its very interesting to think what would have happened if he actually yolod the right members of town and labeled them as mafia...Like that would be play of the tournament hands down if you think about it that way,mafiaLAN,cyg3gug,1,t5_3bfq0
6080978,0,t3_3yu870,Nobody Lynching and insta killing your medic is never a good idea. The meta gaming has them consistently killing their best assets instead of them controlling them a lot better.ML and RL is really fucking the town over and under no real circumstances should  mafia make it to the final round every game.,mafiaLAN,cygp5ut,1,t5_3bfq0
6082113,0,t1_cygubil,Seems pretty solid. Id give OD and Zyori their own category of terribleness because while I dont think Greg or Rob are good they arent quite as bad as those two. Id also probably put LD in tier  because I think he is really strong as town.,mafiaLAN,cyguhx5,10,t5_3bfq0
6848002,0,t3_496a4u,Most likely not until after TI is the general consensus.,mafiaLAN,d0sj0nv,7,t5_3bfq0
7190188,0,t1_d15ykhc,Damn that was so stupid. OD was probably cursed or something right before this event. He survived pretty far quite a few times and he fucked up almost every time.,mafiaLAN,d1vgoxg,1,t5_3bfq0

8664751,0,t1_d6oj1b5,They talked about getting more microphones later so hopefully thatll mean a move to a bigger space too.,mafiaLAN,d6opnoh,1,t5_3bfq0
8674489,0,t3_4yrrc7,I agree with this  Blur was mod killed for making noises during the vigilante round that indicated it was his role. Making noise on purpose during the night rounds should be banned to prevent people clearing themselves in later rounds by making it obvious if they are a role and as such that same ban should follow in all rounds.,mafiaLAN,d6pxmc9,1,t5_3bfq0
8674731,0,t1_d6pyhnl,Agree. I think it wouldnt annoy me so much if he could summarise. When u hear a bad logic argument without interruption for like  mins its especially painful... Especially when other people get talked over constantly,mafiaLAN,d6pypoe,1,t5_3bfq0
8679910,0,t1_d6qlk35,I updated it now. Sorry again!,mafiaLAN,d6qm2ea,1,t5_3bfq0
