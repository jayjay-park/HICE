11345640,0,t3_61sqaj,Why not just take over and start posting in ryangon? Everythings over a month old so none of your posts are going to be burried under others.And small subs shouldnt have offshoots. rburma and rmyanmar dont have enough active posts so whatever Yangon related posts should end up in the national subs. Only once either sub reaches rmalaysia level is it justified to make smaller subs and even then they usually wont get any traffic.Did you make it because you preferred moderator power? I wouldve asked the mods at ryangon theyre both active and probably will reply in  weeks. And even if rejected mod power is not something thats usually useful for most of us its only for those who want to enforce some rules and to edit the subs appearance.I say all of this because its not harmless to make a new sub. That subreddit name you took was ambiguous enough to possibly be needed in the future by something else. It takes an annoying amount of time messaging most mods or waiting on rsubredditrequest for a change in power.Its not that big of a deal I suppose. You did it with a sincere heart.But I think its going to be difficult finding things to post regularly even in a biweekly schedule. I dont want another sub dying for no reason. I personally wouldnt visit it because I want to see Yangonrelated stuff in the national subs for now.,burma,dfi0b2r,4,t5_2qsvv
