1821387,0,t3_2ez8k4,mech e is a very very broad field.  most likely you will take a ton of introbasic classes.  enough so you get the general feel for the subject and a basic understanding.  these would include statics dynamics fluid mechanics feedback and controls a programming language matlab c or fortran are the popular ones thermodynamics heat transfer mechanics of materials and a circuits class.  the unfortunate thing about mech e is that its so broad that you wont even know what you want to focus on until youve taken the class.  generally the most successful student mech es have a great interest in understanding how the world works and why it operates as such since theres so many subjects to go over.  also for any engineering student you shouldnt be afraid of failing.  because there will be times you will go to a class and have no idea what the fuck the professor just said.  so dont be afraid of communicating with TAs professors or classmates.  youre never gonna make it though by yourself.  and this is to teach good engineering practice ie collaboration.you should have a good understanding of solving integrals and diff eqs.  so do well in your math courses.  it will seriously set you behind in your future courses.as for sucking at art..it doesnt really matter.  you will have to take a few design electives and probably your senior project you will have to make something.  youll be using solidworks or something similar anyway.  tldr download the graduating requirements for a mech e of anyevery college you want to attend.  read the course description of all the mech e classes.  if something catches your eye look up a video tutorial on youtube heat transfer example feedback and control systems etc.  dont be intimidated by the videos but be excited to know youre gonna learn all that stuff in the future.hope this helps.,MechanicalEngineering,ck8nxaa,1,t5_2s8xv

3624969,0,t3_31vrhg,I am a senior mechanical engineering student about to graduate.  Ive had  engineering related jobs while in college that I have worked while on breaks.  I received a couple job offers early this year and accepted one to follow my graduation.  Its best to apply between November and February for fulltime. I wish that I had a better work ethic going into college because my grades suffered a bit towards the beginning.  Engineering isnt easy for most but dont feel discouraged.  The curriculum will demand for a wellstructured lifestyle and capability of handling sudden changes spontaneous assignments that may result in late nights. I found problem solving to be the most valuable tool from the overall curriculum.  The first couple years you will take classes where theres always  correct answer.  As you progress through your degree you will encounter classes that will rely on your creative skills and problem solving.  These classes such as machine design do not teach based on ideal scenarios like previous classes.  The assignments use your basic knowledge from other classes but you will account for many variables and have to look at a problem from all angles to determine what YOU think is the best solution.  There are infinite solutions but your grade will depend on how well you can support your decision and if it is a viable solution. My biggest failure was fluid dynamics and heat transfer.  Not only was I very disappointed in the teaching staff for these classes but the content was just tough.  Not my forte I guess.  I loved machine design even though it gave many people nightmares. I received my first coop after my sophomore year through some networking I had done with my peers.  I worked  terms with them.  I have recently accepted a position at a different engineering firm for after I graduate.  I like a balance of desk work and active work testing consulting traveling.  This job offered that along with great benefits.  A good salary is great but good benefits will help put your mind at ease.  When it comes time to find a job dont just look at the salary look at the whole package.  Also salary and benefits or hourly wage for coops are typically negotiable so dont hesitate to ask for me if you can give them a reason why. Refer back to my previous point.  Additionally I found that group work whether it be for a project or just studying together was very valuable.  It teaches you how to work as a team which is important in engineering and helps your learning skills.  If a friend has a question that you know it can benefit you to assist them. I found that any classes that taught me CAD software machining and manufacturing processes and any that inspired creative thinking are most valuable.  I dont see myself using fluid dynamics in my upcoming career but I do see CAD and machine design being most beneficial.  It all depends on what you want to do. Networking and communication are key.  Get on LinkedIn be familiar with your peers join organizations and get to know your professors especially ones who do work that interests you.  Your engineering department likely has paid research opportunities I have done  where youll work on a project under a professors supervision.  It is a lot of fun and one of the most valuable learning experiences you can get while in school.  Organizations can help you network.  I joined a fraternity and met a lot of great people.  One in particular had connections to an engineering firm and helped me get my foot in the door to get a coop with them.  LinkedIn when used properly is an effective tool at discovering and being discovered. Im not sure I understand this question.  Throughout your undergraduate degree try to become familiar with different areas of mechanical engineering.  Use this to find what interests you and Ty to get some experience in it.  This is one of the best ways to prepare yourself for your career.  Many people dont know what they want to do following graduation and will end up with an average job that they may stay with for a year or two before moving on.  Preparation will give you confidence and can assist in landing a position with a very successful company that you will enjoy. due to my limited experience take this lightly.  I have found that good communication assertiveness and willingness to work will get you places.  I have received many promotions in my work life just by being assertive and working hard.  Competence also makes for a good engineer.  Many do not have this ability.   Again limited experience... Many engineering firms like to see their engineers move into businessrelated positions such as sales.  Being open to trying new fields can be beneficial.  Some places might want to keep you in the same position forever not my thing.  Ive noticed that an engineer who has the ability to learn new things quickly will do just fine.  Side note.  Invest early for your future.  Put some money away into some passive investing such as index funds that will grow over the next  or so years.  A little investment now can benefit you greatly in the future.  ,MechanicalEngineering,cq5h22a,3,t5_2s8xv

8271229,0,t1_d5b9kha,Going from k to k was actually a change in the companies policy.  A little before a year after getting bumped to k the company rolled out a formal pay scale for different job brackets.  The pay scale for engineers started at k so I got the bump from that.Here soon Im getting ready to ask for a raise.  This will be my first time asking for a raise.  All of my other bumps in pay came from accepting new positions or in the aforementioned case a change in policy.  Heres how I plan on presenting it Ive been making the same pay for  years k.  In that time I managed a M project that was a massive success Will increase capacity and throughput out of that cell significantly and allow for up to an additional several millions of dollars of additional revenue per year from that cell.  The same system needs two airlock system.  One is built.  I redesigned the air lock system for the second airlock that will save about k in the build of that second air lock.  I will use these as examples of what Ive done for you so far. They just named me lead engineer over an M project to build a totally new system.  This project will stretch out over  months and will more than double the capacity through that same cell.  It is a substantial amount of additional responsibility.  I will use this as an example of what Im doing for you now. Ive interviewed at a few different places over the last several months just to get a feel for what the market says that Im worth.  Ive had two offers come my way.  Both in the low to mid k range.  I plan on emphasizing to them that I dont want to leave and have since turned down these offers but this is what the market says that Im worth.  So to recap I plan on presenting to them What Ive done for them and the value its brought. What Im doing for them now and the value it will bring. What the market says Im worth vs. what Im being paid.  Im hoping that this will net me a pay raise.  ,MechanicalEngineering,d5bgnwc,1,t5_2s8xv

I dont recommend attempting to design your own car without having built one already and as you say having only basic knowledge.I have a colleague who built a Shelby Cobra kit car.  I can vouch that he felt it was an enjoyable project but it took him some years to finish and he had his share of difficulties even with his years of experience in mechanical systems design at a large aerospace company.If I were in your position I would look into classes at local community colleges on automotive technology.

You will take less courses in grad school unless you try to get all your courses done in your first year.... had a friend do this he didnt sleep very much.. But how challenging the course is really depends on the professor and the breadth of course material. Ive tried to limit myself to only  courses a term Ive taken  a few terms not including seminar courses. Grad courses will either cover more material or go into further depth but if you dont take  courses then you should have the same amount time to study and prepare for class.,MechanicalEngineering,dfufdqa,1,t5_2s8xv
11678798,0,t3_66mtp8,Ive been out of the HVAC world now for  years but my first  years out of College with an ME was in the HVAC field also in California.  I was on the sales side worked for both Carrier and York selling commercial equipment and systems. For me it was a wonderful experience technical sales to owners engineers and contractors.  It allowed me to use some of my ME degree and expand my sales and customer relation skills.  It also gave me the opportunity to make a significant amount of cash in commissions.As far as the PE question goes it depends on what your job description is  what sort of firm are you going to work for and what are you going to be doing?Im happy to share more of my experience  feel free to PM me if you want to get into specifics.,MechanicalEngineering,dgjt429,7,t5_2s8xv
