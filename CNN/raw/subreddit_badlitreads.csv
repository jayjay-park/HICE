In general Futurism isnt as important to Italian literature as say Modernism or Surrealism were to English and French literature because our major poets followed other styles mainly Hermetism and Crepuscolarism. Big names were Ungaretti and Saba and from personal taste Dino Campana later Montale was the Allfather of Italian poetry. Futurism had a greater impact in visual arts than in poetry.I wonder where over here is Southern America? Its kinda curious there seems to be some tie between Italy and Chile Argentina. Argentina of course because a lot of Italians emigrated there  where Im from its actually pretty easy to find people who have cousins and uncles from Buenos Aires. The current Pope is actually originary of a small town around here. So probably there has been some mixing of literature. It wouldnt be difficult to argue that Borges read Papini  immigrants bring their culture and therefore literature with them so Borges could easily have access to it.You know there actually is a literary tradition in Italy of nonnovel novels so Gog fits right in!,badlitreads,d4nik9a,3,t5_3f5gg

Fashion is probably the wrong word bowie after all or perhaps i should have said the world of fashion or the ideology of fashion is too much in that music. Certainly i feel there is something of this in sufjan where she is more liminal and a mystery like bowie,badlitreads,d4ybb59,1,t5_3f5gg
