976321,0,t3_2587ki,One of my favorite TMBG lyrics here. It read like someone who is the voice of a oncehip music culture trying to convince herself that its not worth sticking around anymoreAnd she says that the scene isnt what its been  And shes thinking of going home.  That its old and its totally over now  And its old and its over its over now  And its over its over its over now...,tmbg,chf9lqx,2,t5_2s751

2356060,0,t3_2lropx,Like so many others this was my first TMBG song and I still love it.  While I probably wouldnt say its their very best song though still excellent its the one loaded with the most nostalgia love points.  Plus its just super fun.  It was also my entry point into The Spine the first album of theirs I really got into.,tmbg,cm2x4t6,1,t5_2s751

3543728,0,t3_30uety,This has always been one of my more favorite songs simply because of how nonchalant the narrators are. Whether encountering someone they recently killed a sharp object striking their neck or an engineer with a white and evil mask they always talk about it how you would expect someone to talk about a walk through the neighborhood or a trip to the carwash. Also I always expect the second verse to say ...when I felt something heavy and pointed strike me in the back of my pants not neck since pants rhymes with dance. It suits the rhyming pattern in the rest of the song killed and him train and turn but its just something I anticipate for some reason.,tmbg,cpw7hls,5,t5_2s751
3749175,0,t1_cqebfbq,One of my favorite music videos is for Im Impressed. I mean papercraft robots reliving the Roman empire... in bloody detail. Theres something I just like about the video.,tmbg,cqjmqnf,1,t5_2s751
3782368,0,t1_cqndhhf,I agree. Its rather disappointing. Im a big POTA and TMBG fan and just cant listen to those again... except now when I fire them up to remind myself how bad they are.Ugh its the weird whiny vocals from Flans that kills an otherwise jazzy instrumental.,tmbg,cqnf2m9,2,t5_2s751

5905341,0,t1_cxtdk04,You gotta be super picky about which songs you expose them to. Use the ones that are really poppy and agreeable.  Birdhouse Ana Ng Twisting I should be allowed to think Judy is your Viet Nam Dont Lets Start Cyclops Rock Tubthumping Bills Bills Bills New York CityYou know things that sound like what they might hear on the radio.

Certain People I Could Name. CanajoharieIts a bit interesting only one new song since  has been able to work its way into my Top . Im not going to lie Mink Car The Spine Much of Join Us and Nanobots all fell pretty flat for me. The Else is consistently good but nothing amazing. I can see a few of the songs from the new DaS batch making a dent. Im really digging Trouble Awful Devil Evil Shape Shifters and Ill be Haunting You but only time will tell if they have the staying power of the  songs I listed above.,tmbg,cywtf99,3,t5_2s751
