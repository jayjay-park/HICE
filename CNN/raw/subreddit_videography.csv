Youll want to see the couple during the vows. Youll want to see the brides face more than the grooms.   Dont shoot this angle from behind them but dont put the camera so far in front that the pastorpriestetc block the couple form the camera Youll not be able to adjust this camera during the ceremony so dont zoom in too close.Shot   This shot should be near the back of the event. As high as is reasonable. balcony? A wide enough shot to capture the entire wedding party grooms menbrides madeSHOT while this shot should be mobile youll still want to use stabilization.. I recommend a monopod with a small triple leg foot. use this camera to get the wedding party entering the venue no batter what you do with this camera NEVER cross into the field of view of SHOT. get broll of the audience during the ceremony get broll of the bridal partyDSLRs are great and offer amazing DoF but when youre solo shooting a wedding you dont have time for Shot  and Shot  to be done with a DSLR.  You need the continuos runtime and autofocus that makes camcorders relevant. Shot  can be a DSLR but youll be incredibly busy adjusting your setting instead of focusing on the compositions.

Premiere is fast has all the features you need in an editing platform extensive third party support for hardware and plugins a huge user base good support and the way it works with the rest of the creative suite like After Effects and Illustrator push it above Avid in my opinion.Most of the time I cut on Avid but I am liking it less and less.  I can cut just as quickly in Premiere and the way Premiere and After Effects work together for making titles and effects is almost seamless compared to the chore that it is in Avid.Final Cut is cheaper and will probably do what you need.  I was completely pushed away from it when FCX came out and killed it as a professional application.  Apple made some good improvements to the software and it may be a more viable option now but I havent really looked into it.

Users who use the above methodology to test for the buzz will also be able to clearly record it.When you drop audio gain levels or use an activepowered mic room tone does a good job of masking the buzz so its hard to detect and you get divergent reports from users.The bottom line though is that Panasonic have confirmed the issue on numerous occasions and are now offering a way to fix the issue.Also Panasonic have said that any camera that comes from the factory with v. firmware already installed also have the audio fix.

2233919,0,t3_2kp0g5,Im no expert but Ive found there are a number of reasons why a given lens is better than another but often it has to do with the speed of the lens. Your kit lens will usually have a maximum aperture of f. and worse theyre variable aperture. They dont usually let in enough light to get fast enough shutter speeds when shooting video especially if you have motion in frame. Cheaper lenses also have more distortion messy colors and are usually not as sharp as an expensive prime.I also think that video is going to look worse than stills because the image processors in the camera are designed for stills not video. For instance Canon is notorious for slightly fuzzy video while having fantastic stills.If youre looking to improve your video invest in a fast normal prime! You cant go wrong with a mm f.. When it comes to lenses you really do get what you pay for. Kit lenses will do okay but they just cant compare to the more expensive lenses out there.,videography,clns9kp,1,t5_2qwgz

As a business owner you are constantly investing into your business. The  an hour is the BEST case scenario for profit. Lets say something goes wrong lose an SD card camera dies your assistant has a car accident the list can go on and on ... but weddings dont have retakes. There is a high liability with them over many other events you could film.  Keep in mind those numbers I used dont include health insurance dental life and other business expenses plus you lose your weekend on a wedding. If you have ever run a steady cam for  hours of a wedding you lose the next day too. That is exhausting!  Since weddings are booked so far in advance you cant really predict what could happen when the event day is. And because of the cost of a wedding and the last minute nature of emergencies if you have someone pass away you have the flu or anything else the chances of being able to have someone fill your spot with the same skill set is slim to none.

Under regular lighting they will look much better than a PD.The AU is an HDV camera I strongly recommend going for a digital media based workflow. Never worry about tape running out or the heads getting clogged ever again.If you want something that is more like a PD than a VX look at the CX HXRNX or the NXU. If nobody is paying you to make the videos though stick with the CX series. It is hard to justify the extra  to  dollars just to get a few more exposure controls when the basic video engine in the cheap CXs is so good.I had a fleet of big cameras like the PMWEX and the CXs after moving past the PDVX stage of my life and frankly I should I just used CXs the whole time.

3061798,0,t3_2v79wf,Ill try and break it down from what Ive seen in commercials.Clarity With protune on and daytime lighting it takes very little correction to get a very vibrant shot. All you have to do at least in my experience is boost the contrast drop the greens and reds slightly and boost the blues slightly. This has always worked well in my experience. Also timelapse shots are almost certainly using k.Shakiness From what I can tell this is from three things but keep in mind shots are often very brief in these commercials. Many shots are done from drones which on a windless day should give you a relatively smooth shot. Slomo shots are frequently used which will also naturally look much smoother. Plenty of shots are almost an optical illusion of smoothness. Any video which is attached to something in view of the gopro will look steady because that object draws the majority of your attention. The background is actually not particularly smooth. This is apparent in motorcycle scenes.Exposure As I said earlier many of the commercials only use brief clips therefore they can adjust brightness to be quite constant throughout.Finally the most important factor Im sure Gopro is getting terabytes of footage sent in by pros and amateurs everyday. They probably have teams of people digging through video and are able to pick and choose the  seconds out of  videos that works for their purposes. Im sure if you film every stunt or action you do multiple times at the end of the year youd be able to make a gopro commercial quality video. ,videography,cofcp41,7,t5_2qwgz

Editors and designers are just combining ingredients to make something greater and thats all templates are ingredients.

4270538,0,t3_39h566,I got my start filming skateboarding and am fully aware of how much pressure there is to buy the  VX  Death Lens setups for action sports filmers. I used to own a VX  Century Optics Death Lens setup  years ago. I cant stress this enough DO NOT expect to do work professionally with that setup or even really to be able to expand your techniques on the same level as what you can with even the basic tech from the last few years. As a hobby that is fine but I cant in good conscience recommend that camera to anybody serious about film making in general. That includes for action sports.You will definitely want to stay away from Skate Perception too. The moment you have anything halfway close to an original thought there the wizards of pretention will show there face and tell you that their way is all that exists.

4571707,0,t3_3dn3ud,I cannot figure out why no one seems to be excited for this camera. I loved the DVX. Its the camera I learned on. I was super excited when I found out this awesome follow up was going to be released. Im a run and gun type shooter. I hate being bogged down by equipment and generally just throw a mm on my camera and never change it. The focal length of this integrated lens seems amazing. And the fact that you can record internal K  FPS and output at bit really make this a super appealing camera for me. I suppose if you have a lot of money invested in glass it really doesnt make much sense.

4614508,0,t3_3e2iru,Nice cinematography. I like how you timed a lot of the cuts to the rhythm of the song. The AB story was clearly told with not much confusion but I could see the pain in the guys eyes who played the abusive boyfriend he couldnt sell that role. Try to keep the camera low and angled up to enhance the effect of power and dominance of the character of attention cant do much for his acting so you have to compensate where you can and the opposite for the victims or weaker characters angle the camera down and make them appear smaller an more helpless.Also maybe pay more attention to the momentum of the song and where you are in the video. I felt tension in certain parts like when both characters were about to find the church but it didnt sync well with the tension in the song. When they entered the church at the climax of the song I was expecting a strong visual but I was underwhelmed by the light fixture in front of a stained glass window. I was expecting a shot from inside the church as they opened the doors with focus on the two main characters standing proud next to each other at a pivitol point in their lives as they have left their toxic existences to seek redemption. It almost felt like you were paying less attention towards the end as if you were maybe pressed for time.

4997228,0,t1_cuoa5u7,Its an easy analogy but I dont think it holds up.  This update provides no new functionality only improves on functionality that already exists.  The entire purpose of the camera is to create images I would expect that it does it to the absolute best that the camera is possible of creating.  So theyve developed a new way of getting extra DR from the sensor that should absolutely be an included and free update.Lets assume for a second that instead of VLOG was some sort of touch screen NLE that allowed you to edit clips together straight from the camera.

5294365,0,t1_cvoeb99,Please dont go out buying work lights.  They get extremely hot to handle and can easily be knocked over.  They take awhile to cool down and there is no convenient way to carry them for travel. The light quality and intensity is also much harder to control without a Cstand Gobo and flagsdiffusion.Your best option is to buy LED lights.  There are some really decent ones for  dollars and even some barely acceptable ones for under .  These dont get hot to handle and are easy to travel with. Just search on BHPhotoVideo.  I recommend getting at least the  ones that require a light stand.  Make sure to buy some sort of diffusion and color temperature modifier usually included in the form of a plastic covering and keep in mind that cheap LEDS often have a slight green or magenta bias so youll have to compensate for that in color temp or color correction.If you want to be really cheap go for two  small LED lights and buy lightstands for them.  Those small LEDs will provide more than sufficient lighting for interviews.  The lighting is quite hard though since theyre so intense and small.  Theyre really painful to have pointed directly at someones face near in front of them so definitely dont do that.Your next best option are cheaper lights like these around  ish depending which one you buy. Make sure you have thick work gloves to use with these.  These also get hot to handle but definitely not as bad as work lights.Your rd best option are Kino Flo lights for about  on BHPhotoVideo.  But if you know nothing about kino flos just skip this one.   Theyre kinda crappy looking and I have no experience with cheap kinos.You can also find some more powerful continuous photography lighting up to w that are less than  the build is an attempt to mimic tungsten light design and light stands with barndoors.

In my view p and the smaller form factor are not worth the loss of the LCD.Rather than waiting for the Micro if you want a Blackmagic here is how you can put together a very nice  stop BMPCC RAW A cam with a reasonable crop that looks something like this  for less than  Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera    Metabones Canon EF to MFT .x Speed Booster S model so it also fits on your GH    you can spend  more if you want one with .x crop reduction  specifically made for the BMPCC Kinotehnik LCD Viewfinder for the BMPCC    Black Magic Design Pocket Cinema Camera External Battery Mount for ENEL    Pistol grip with trigger for BMPCC    Smallrig Cold Shoe     x spare ENEL batteries   With this setup you will have a capable little handheld camera that can mount either Canon EF or native MFT lenses.Here is what this little powerhouse cinema camera can doNarrativeDocumentaryMusic VideoTravelLow LightThere are lots more examples in the Pocket Cinema Camera group  I moderate over on Vimeo.Although it has a steeper learning curve than a consumer camera and color grading in post is pretty much mandatory  this is absolutely the best filmmakers camera in this price range.With a  budget your next best option since you already have the lenses is probably a  Panasonic GHR  with VLOG and essentially unlimited continuous recording no  minute limit.With VLOG you get extended dynamic range that comes close to what you can get from the BMPCC.  GH shooters are already getting great results with it spin drift.  Sunrise  Sunset  Panasonic GH Vlog L Tokyo Yokohama You can see many more examples in the GHK group  I moderate over on Vimeo.I own the GH as well and with incamera K p slow motion and VLOG  it is a very capable cinema camera.Either of these cameras would be a good investment  personally I shoot more with the GH than with the BMPCC because it is easier to use.Hope this is helpful and good luck with your upgrade!HCR,videography,cw4iv44,3,t5_2qwgz

So if editing long form  mins videos take you forever dont offer to do it. You wont loose business because for the most part couple dont really know what they want they just know they want things documented well.

5717260,0,t3_3tfve9,Congrats on the new camera and welcome to the world of video!  I recommend you try focusing manually before you spend a lot of money on a follow focus.You certainly dont want to rely on autofocus with this camera especially with Nikons noisy autofocus motors Which brings us to sound.  The best investment you can make as a new videographer is in mics and eventually lighting  although your camera is pretty darned good in low light.You probably dont want to deal with synchronizing a separate sound track from an external recorder so I recommend a relatively inexpensive . Sony ECMAW Bluetooth wireless mic and receiver  for interviews with friends.Bluetooth may not be a long term solution but it is relatively inexpensive and it works a lot better than VHF wireless mics in the same price class.Heres a test and review of the nearly identical previous version the AW SONY ECMAW Wireless Bluetooth Microphone Test and Review Hope this is helpful and good luck!,videography,cx5s60i,1,t5_2qwgz

If you can find a full four thirds version its about ...otherwise a used Canon version is the next cheapest at  with  for an EF to m adapter.

Id definitely recommend you buying both of those lenses ASAP  and yes theyll last.  The Rokinon  is NOT A COMPROMISE  it totally competes for video at least with the more expensive s.  The Oly mm is also VERY USEFUL for the CU focusing and extended range it has over the Panny zoom.  Youll want to keep it even if you get the mm Panny.

6519565,0,t3_44xhfr,The camera only shoots progressive so you are not seeing interlacing. The flicker that is present in the lights is a combination of the AC current going to the lights their ballasts possibly and your shutter speed in camera.  The D has an advertised flicker reduction feature in movie mode which allows you to set a  or hz refresh rate that MIGHT help in some situations.  You can also try slightly adjusting your shutter speed as well. Full control over your surroundings is obviously ideal so if you can shoot around those issues that would be key.,videography,czto9y5,5,t5_2qwgz

Its a pretty sony world out there. People keep talking about how much heavier the FS is then the FS. As a  cm tall camera operator I basically never have the camera on my should as it screws the eye line and makes every one look really small. I tend to hold it out front of me and tuck it into my stomach. I  use the FS without the side arm just like an FS just fine. Its a bit larger but I dont find it unwieldy at all. Unless you are going to broadcast or some one makes a specific request for a K online wedding I dont see the point of pushing for a FS. Also if you are adapting canon glass to it I find the FS has WAY less issues on the metabones front where the FS is a bit of a disaster especially with the speed boost.

Elapsed time five seconds. Without ball leveling you must adjust one or more leg length to level the unit which is a major pain.Inexpensive tripods are sold with head and legs preassembled and they almost never have ballleveling.Sadly the legs you linked to dont have a bowl and that head doesnt have a ball as far as I can tell.If you want a heavy duty tripod with bowl leveling I recommend the . Ravelli AVTP Professional  which has a  lb. capacity and a mm bowl shown here I bought this tripod almost  years ago and it will probably last another .

7571645,0,t3_4j0wpr,The first step would be identifying if this is a heavily scripted or run and gun style production. One of my coworkers did a short documentary piece on our local Quidditch club and it was shot in an afternoon run and gun style. One thing you can do is meet with the club and talk with them about what they do and when so you have some context. Do your research to know and understand the subject. Since youre doing interviews make your questions the script. Design them to get the interviewee to tell the story and dont be afraid to request adjusting their answer to shorten it or alter the words slightly. Ill often have ideas for broll to shoot before production begins and then there will be additions when an interview mentions something directly. Editing is incredibly important. Its the stage where you weave the story together into the flow youre seeking. With multiple interviews you may have several people answering the same question so you have a lot of freedom in designing the story. When it comes to logistics I always be sure to confirm all equipment is available along with potential crew for the production dates. I like to schedule some extra time in case the worst happens though usually it means we get to wrap up an hour or two earlier which everyone likes. Be sure to have permission in the locations youll be shooting in rights to music releases for oncamera individuals etc. if necessary. Theres plenty to plan for and always something unexpected good or bad. ,videography,d32uxr1,4,t5_2qwgz

It costs virtually nothing to file the claim and you dont have to hire a lawyer you can just represent yourself. When you go to court the whole procedure should take less than a day and if you lose all you lose is a day of your time and maybe like  in court fees or something.

7957689,0,t3_4o79nc,I would say all three of those things are eventually necessary but at different phases.  . The Sigma Lens.  Absolutely phenomenal lens.  The GH  SB  Sigma  was my setup and it was unparalleled in look and quality.  I would say get this before you even consider anything else and I would even suggest selling the rest of your lenses.  You will rarely need a lens outside of this range unless you need super wide or telephoto..  I would spend some time with the lens use this time to save up more money and do some extra jobs then I would get the Ronin as your next big step up to serious paying jobs.  I definitely dont suggest buying the Ronin too early.  Its a pretty serious piece of equipment and the type of jobs youd use it on would require a pretty solid client base anyways and those come with time and experience..  The DJI Phantom comes last.  I say that because aside from its initial cool factor it is a flourish piece.  Meaning in most cases you should be using it very sparingly.  Most people that buy Phantoms are usually so invested in it that they want to use it as much as possible in their films and tend to over use high flying scenery shots.

The Konova slider is well worth the investment though.Ive never met a Tascam preamp I would use in a professional setting and they are not cheap enough to justify the quality difference. Zoom is definitely the winner on this one.LED panels that change color do so at the very real cost of losing a LOT of light output. Have you used them?

8285811,0,t3_4sy2jk,Yes and for multiple reasons.  The ones that I can think of right off the bat are... . The farther the distance of the light the more power you need to light the subject due to the law of inverse law of light.  Basically when you double the distance from the light source to the subject the light drops off by a third. Softboxes when up close provide a lot of wraparound light especially if they are larger softboxes.  Which is great for product and some macro applications in addition to creative portrait lighting. The further your light source is away from the subject the harder and sharper the shadows. ,videography,d5da9v8,3,t5_2qwgz

9158602,0,t1_d8ciopb,If youre planning on doing live videos basically any BlackMagic camera will be pretty unsuitable as BM usually make film cameras. Their live production cameras are also unsuitable unless youre willing to spend thousands on other equipment needed for live broadcast. To answer your question in the original post the GH is a lot cheaper than the BMCC for a lot of reasons but it mostly has to do with a bunch of features that really only matter to big productions. The BMCC shoots bit RAW for the utmost video quality the GH doesnt. The BMCC shoots onto fast professionalgrade SSDs the GH only records onto inexpensive and relatively slow SD cards. The BMCC has the ability to manage metadata which matters when youve got two cameras and four audio recorders shooting fifty takes of the same scene. The GH does not. The BMCC connects to a PC via Thunderbolt for editing terabytes of footage directly from the camera. The GH has no need for any of these features because its developed for a fundamentally different audience. An audience which doesnt need RAW or metadata management or crazy high bitrates. What you should be looking at is something like this link or like this link which will provide all the features youll need in a simple and effective package.,videography,d8cx4vs,2,t5_2qwgz

Sure there are ways you could make it work but thats just adding complexity to your shoot thatll distract you from framing and focus.Rent a camcorder itll be easy as pie. Any pro camcorder with HDMI or HDSDI out and a suitable capture device and youll be good to go plus youll have a proper servo zoom to work with which will make your life so much eaisier.Just to add be careful with Blackmagic capture devices  theyre cheap and generally pretty decent but theyre very picky about their input signal as they dont generally have hardware scalars.

A little more expensive but solid build quality and slightly better optical quality. Its equivalent to a mm focal length on full frame the classic photojournalistic field of view.

10169188,0,t3_5llhqz,This is pretty nice. Good work. if youre looking for feedback Id trim the front end off of a lot of the shots where youre circling from  the back of someones head to a profile. You have several shots at the beginning looking at the back of peoplewhich is never as interesting as looking at the face obviously. Your shot of the woman walking through the gauntlet is perfectlytimed and framed for this and you didnt spend so much time staring at the back of her head. There are also a couple shots like the catch of the football that I would recompose so our eye isnt looking at the negative space in the center of the frame.  Alsotry to put some of the diversity in the front of your reel because the first half or so is very white guy.  This is just good form for showing you can work with a variety of clients and faces. Id personally lose the pink headband rapping guy and crunch the blacks a little on the mud shot because it feels a little milked in the splash truck.The reason I mentioned the rapping guy is because you have several moments of guys mugging in front of the camera and this detracts from the professionalism of the rest and looks more like bros horsing around which you dont want to project.

Shooting quick and fast on it is great its reliable and while not perfect it gets the job done.However there is absolutely no replacing a proper usage of a gimbalsteadicam. The footage and control is much more refined with a stabilizer and it can only stand to improve the footage.

10702125,0,t3_5t3j1r,Just finished my first corporate video.  Looking for some feedback as to how you would have done things differently especially regarding Broll see comments below.  I think for a first attempt and the very fair price I charged its ok  I wouldnt exactly say Im happy with it though.  Theyre getting me to do some more stuff next week so they must not hate it.Gear used Sony ARii Sony A  Zhiyun Crane Rhino Slider  EVO Aputure  lights x RodeLink wireless lavEdited in Sony Vegas Pro some colour correction done in Davinci. Titles done with NewBlueFX Titler Pro .Some of the challenges I faced My lighting gear is currently not sufficient to handle the dynamic range of the day sky and comparatively low light of the office.  This resulted in the the interview shots looking underexposed.  I had to choose between filming him properly exposed in his ACTUAL office which was claustraphobic and visually unimpressive no view or setting up a fake office near a window with a view of the iconic Brisbane Story Bridge in the background but having him a bit underexposed.  Im waiting for Aputure COBd lights to start shipping which will allow a much stronger light source in future videos. Broll.  In their Brisbane office they are a team of three in a very small office.  The main service that their business offers is outsourcing financial work to India etc.  Normally for Broll I would have liked to visually demonstrate the subject matter but I obviously could not film their outsourcing teams and the client was not interested in using any stock footage.  Any tips on how to get around a problem like this?  Im going to start using After Effects and get some infographic templates. The map section is a bit soso.  I recommended that they get a graphic designer to create something that I could use but they didnt want to go down that path. Audio was ok but next time I think Ill try booming the Rode Video Mic Pro instead of using the lavs.,videography,ddjuf5s,1,t5_2qwgz

10705867,0,t3_5t54zj,If your only lens is the kit lens youre way better off just buying a few more lenses to use with your Ti. Its a totally capable camera and it will probably be a while before its the weak link in the videos you make. When you say cinematic look youre probably meaning shallow depth of field lens with low aperture and a fps video. Buy a mm . about  make sure youre shooting at fps and at  shutter speed or  if your camera cant and youll be totally capable of making exciting and cinematic short films with the camera you have. ,videography,ddk8b07,1,t5_2qwgz

10883068,0,t1_de29aqu,Spot on if I were to guess at exactly the format Id go for an HDV or HDCAM camcorder shooting i.To get that effect properly youd need to shoot on a camera that does proper broadcast standard interlacing where each field is actually captured at a different point in time and then intentionally convert it to progressive without doing proper deinterlacing. Thats why you get the stripey effect because both fields are being shown at once but they wernt actually captured at the same time when recorded.That makes it quite tricky to fake. If you interlace progressive footage you end up with each frame being split into two fields but when that gets converted to progressive you basically end up with the same frame that you put in to it.One way you could make it work is to shoot fps then somehow convert those frames to fields in i then convert to p.Its not really a look thats worth aspiring too though... When anyone who knows what interlacing is sees that footage theyll immediately think you screwed up.,videography,de2ieqe,1,t5_2qwgz

Aside from the different voices which some others have already mentioned its just the editing that really makes this drag on a bit.

I have read quite a few articles suggesting DSLRs are reasonably good for documentaries due to them producing more cinematic looking images. Would this not be the case on a fairly low budget?

I already have a camera that is far better than a GoPro for image quality underwater but not as good as my normal camera hence why I didnt mention it. Im sure GoPros dont make great cameras for docs though do they? Im just confused as with your first comment I would have still picked a reasonable DSLR over a GoPro any day for underwater film making but Ive never done it before so am not sure!Thanks,videography,dgbwhi7,1,t5_2qwgz

Just curious I mean I know with editing softwares its like a you pay for what you get type thing. Id love to have the adobe premiere but fuck its expensive Im also a broke college student. ,videography,dgi7otn,1,t5_2qwgz

Some people may not want a camera in their face like that.I hope you are bringing some other form of stabilization too  ideally a tripod. Shakiness in business promos is not good. ,videography,dgkrkus,2,t5_2qwgz
11688672,0,t3_66q4lk,There is a long explanation from Panasonic in the DVX Tech Brief VLog L Based Production It says exposing to the right ETTR may not be the best way to shoot VLOG L ...as a general technique theres nothing wrong with ETTR it does work and it is a reasonable choice. However it is not necessarily the best choice because ETTR is designed to preserve the highlights with no consideration of what happens to the midtones. It can result in retaining a lot of detail and in making the leastnoisy footage but it will mandate extensive postproduction correction on every single shotThe better method might be to use zebras and a wave form monitor to expose for middle gray at  IRE with  stops below and  stops above.Bottom line In general I advise against overexposing VLOGL when it can be avoided the asymmetrical nature of the curve  stops below  stops above middle gray mean that overexposing will shift that balance even further if one were to overexpose by two stops theyd have a curve with  stops below middle gray and only two stops above! My advice is to expose middle gray at  IRE whenever possible.Hope this is helpful and good luck!,videography,dgkxg6k,1,t5_2qwgz

Budget for body and lens is about  mic and tripod or whatever is about . Rough estimates. Thanks.,videography,dgqnva5,2,t5_2qwgz
11766274,0,t3_67w9h5,Cool man. Some ideas Ditch all the animation at the end. Just fade stuff in and out. The moving around gives it a lates feel that isnt cool. Put all the end titles over white instead of black. The black plus the dragon makes it feel like its for a martial arts studio or something. Pull back your highlights if youre able. Presently the white sails and white buildings are VERY blown out. Pulling those back will help a lot. The best kind of color correction is the kind you do before you shoot  doing a custom whitebalance to a neutral surface will help a lot.,videography,dgtqk4s,2,t5_2qwgz

Most people that see it on TV or from a distance dont know how ghetto rigged our setups can be.Gaff tape and zip ties secure many thousands of dollars of equipment and I bet that riser hes on isnt even level or all that stable. ,videography,dguwua8,20,t5_2qwgz
