4842060,0,t1_cu4vdja,Ehh Ive been wanting to go to EDC Vegas for a while now. I literally just got back from Vegas today and am back in MD and am just completely in love with Vegas even though their club scene consists of a bunch of pretentious socialite  douche bags flocking to OmniaHakkasanWet Republic every weekend wearing their dress shirts and dress shoes and showing up to a nightclub like its fucking work.But EDC LV gets crazy probably crazier then Bisco and Forest combined. The Strip and the entire city of Las Vegas is just madness during EDC week and I cant miss out on that shit lmao.,MoonriseMusicFestival,cu4vncl,2,t5_38q84

7803674,0,t1_d3t6o6l,Yeah the complaints were RIDICULOUS and I was really happy that Moonrise took them to heart. I think they even sent out a notification on the appsocial media to apologize for the line and ensure it would be fixed. But yeah it bordered on molestation sometimes and people were really upset. But most of us didnt let it ruin our days personally I was still ecstatic the moment I entered the racecourse   ,MoonriseMusicFestival,d3t6zwb,3,t5_38q84

8412277,0,t3_4uupt3,So lucky for you out of the trap genre which is very hiphop based and can also get very hard and aggressive like dubstep has been born something called future bass  bass driven but very mellow happysounding and chill. There are a ton of future bass names on the Moonrise lineup mostly in the rd tier and based on your description I think you might like them at least give them a chance. Try San Holo Giraffage or Louis Futon.,MoonriseMusicFestival,d5t2u84,3,t5_38q84

8529987,0,t3_4wkjle,Dont feel the need for the aggression simply because so long as festivals allow it you cant really blame people even as annoying as it is. My issue is if youre gonna bring it hold it the fuck up dont be lazy and rest it on your shoulders.  different occasions yesterday I had a fucking totem on someones shoulder in front of me not only blocking my view but blocking the entire stage ,MoonriseMusicFestival,d67t92n,3,t5_38q84
8551452,0,t3_4ww5ve,Take my downvote.  Our totem was a lifesaver for finding each other all weekend and shit was in a flat field...I wasnt counting on being able to see the whites of any DJs eyes unless I was rail riding.  I understand your frustration if you are a little shorter but it was never an issue for any of us.  Banning totems first of all will never happen and secondly would be really shitty for the vibes.  ,MoonriseMusicFestival,d6ai62x,10,t5_38q84

8575440,0,t1_d6d6wm5,There were four indeed. Dont know how you couldnt find the others. They were right where the little venue maps they passed out said they were. I would add that they were kind of hard to find if you didnt know where to look for. They should add huge flags that stand above the crowd with like water drops or something so that people can easily find them. ,MoonriseMusicFestival,d6dih2i,1,t5_38q84
8596784,0,t3_4x6k2u,I missed them at Forest and my squad said they were so much better at EF... but I watched those videos and I feel like their set at Moonrise was better.
