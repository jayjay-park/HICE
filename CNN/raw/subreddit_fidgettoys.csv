9429293,0,t1_d96airz,ABEC is just a tolerance rating. So ABEC  has less tolerance for errors. ABEC  has more tolerance. So technically you could get a ABEC  bearing that spins longer than a ABEC . its just more likely for a ABEC  to be more precise than a ABEC . And to be fair an ABEC  rating doesnt matter at all in such a low RPM. It matters in high RPM machine parts but not in a spinner or a Skateboard. Its just a scam from skate bearing companies to make more money.same for ceramic ,fidgettoys,d9b876d,1,t5_3g3jo

Once that is done you can choose to either call it a day or put a thin lubricant in place. The thin lubricant will make it run more quiet and it will make the bearing last longer. The lubricant might make the bearing spin slower but not by much if it is thin. ,fidgettoys,da5nygg,3,t5_3g3jo

10118401,0,t3_5kq9gj,I was given a fidget toy off Amazon as part of a secret santa gift. Its a little combination of a bike chain and keyrings and is actually pretty fun to flip through my fingers. Completely silent and pretty much goes everywhere with me. Its one of the first things you see when you search for fidget toy. ,fidgettoys,dbqfoin,1,t5_3g3jo

10698039,0,t1_ddj8f5v,Its for the colour blind or just the blind in general. People suggested calling it the Braille Box but since its not braille they didnt want to mislead people. Im not sure if it is called the symbol cube but thats what Ive been calling it. ,fidgettoys,ddjf8s6,2,t5_3g3jo

10865690,0,t3_5v7ywu,If it comes in a child size I might buy it. Im not keen on cinching the band as tight as it can go for my child and having a long strip dangle from the wrist.Itd probably be better if the moving parts were the same color as the band. They bill it as discreet fidgeting so it definitely needs to look like a singlecolor band at first glance. Not everyone wears long sleeves. ,fidgettoys,de0pvwx,1,t5_3g3jo

10908375,0,t3_5vujg1,You can only buy these in the USA again because Zen magnets fought a long and expensive legal battle they have only recently won. If you are in the US Id recommend buying from them if possible.  They also has the highest quality available preban and expect thats still true postban.,fidgettoys,de54dxe,3,t5_3g3jo
10936090,0,t3_5vzunt,I actually do fingerboard but I dont think its a great fidget toy because you cant concentrate on something else whilst doing it. Its also super loud so if you want to do it in class or while working it can be very distracting. I do love fingerboarding but I just dont think its the best fidget toy.,fidgettoys,de7zbi4,1,t5_3g3jo

11656186,0,t1_dgh78o3,Paul from Rotablade is an absolute standup guy and top notch customer service His products are well deserving of their price tags. It makes me sad to see people buy up clones of his products. Ill take the work of a mechanical engineer with years of experience in precision fields over some cheap chinese product. I own  genuine spinners Vorso  Rotablades and a Torqbar. I own one d printed one a couple random spinners from amazon and a knockoff torqbar Fidget farms zen. The Vorso Rotablades and Torqbars are far superior to the other ones so much that ive given them away to my extended families kids. You do what you want but I highly encourage people to buy the genuine products for more reasons than the doing the right thing. They are far superior in quality. I can two hand spin my SS Stubby for close to min. the cheap knockoffs in my experience are lucky to spin more than  min. ,fidgettoys,dgh8rm1,1,t5_3g3jo
