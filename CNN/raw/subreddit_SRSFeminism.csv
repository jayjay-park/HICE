938363,0,t3_24sew3,Claiming the civil rights movement in the name of the racist first and second waves of feminism merely because black women were involved in it and ignoring the times feminist movements have been actively antigay and antitrans and even supported policy changes that harmed us?This article is terrible.,SRSFeminism,chay44u,11,t5_2tedd

2070388,0,t3_2ih73v,Im having trouble understanding how feminist values actually solved the problem she was undertaking specifically the write performance of the atime attribute of a file. The nearest I can figure is that she only even attempted to address the problem because it was brought up in a feminist forum. Whats particularly antipatriarchy about that? Obviously Im missing or skimming through something in my read. Can somebody shed some light? ,SRSFeminism,cl2zpta,3,t5_2tedd

3009565,0,t1_co9r8z5,The reason I pointed out that I dont come from a privileged background is because I have had more than a few feminists tell me that the fact that I dont come from a broken home and that my parents Homeschooled me that makes me privileged. To them that means that I have never had to experience what it really means to live as a woman in the real world. I would define discrimination as someone elses skewed values prohibiting me from doing the things I want to do and living the life I want to live.Im not saying it doesnt exist somewhere or that it doesnt still happen. But the best and most fair bosses I have had were males. Alternatively the few female bosses I have had made sure to make my life at work a living hell and were some of the meanest people I have had the displeasure of working with.But Ive seen men get yelled at for being oppressive asshole for holding the door open for a woman. My grandfather was actually fired form his job as a greeter at WalMart for telling a woman you have a good day sweetheart! after she caused a huge scene and accused him of verbally raping her. Please note that my grandfather was not doing this to be creepy or offensive he was just genuinely trying to be nice and that situation threw him into a pretty serious stage of depression. It brakes my heart to this day that a person could do that to someone as amazing and kind as he was.I dont understand how those two instances can be considered oppressive or discriminatory behavior.I dont want to dislike feminists but the encounters I have had have always been less than desirable and havent yet prompted me to sympathize with them. edited some words.,SRSFeminism,co9xtnk,-1,t5_2tedd

3636246,0,t1_cq6fp6l,Elam male backwards get it? get it? wants to rule the MRA with an iron fist. Hes not the lunatic fringe hes hosting the last Mens Rights conferences. What you dont see because youre not looking is that there is a huge group of people who hate the other gender only sees themselves as antithat other gender and uses doxxing hatefilled rhetoric and threats of violence. But its not the feminists thats all from the MRA. But theyre fighting the Feminist who thinks like they do and that feminist only exists in their fevered dreams.Women are not the enemy. The system is. The issues that favor women are not feminist ideas they are part of the system that feminists are fighting to overturn. There is no medium ground between women are people and deserve equal rights and beating women is the only way to make them act better than chimps.If you think there is youve let how the media has turned trying to fight against systemic issues that cost people physical emotional and financial stress just because of their gender into this famous man hating feminist you have to step over the raving lunatic fringe at the head of the MRA at every branch screaming about how much they hate women.Feminism has issues. TERFs and sexworker negative and women of color are all things feminists are dropping the ball on. Hating men? Not even on most feminists radar. Most of them are straight. The actually love men. They just want them to be better people.MRAs want to remove womens right to vote hold jobs own property be raped on that property and most of all stay in the kitchen. These two things are not equal and worst of all there are no moderate MRAs. Men who believe in equality are called feminists its a nongender specific term really.,SRSFeminism,cq6rcoc,1,t5_2tedd
3860116,0,t1_cquqox1,Theyre supposed to be doubleblind. The only problem Ive had when assisting professors was that the combination of the subject matter and the professor citing a couple of their own papers made it pretty clear who they were. But the names arent supposed to be up there and were they in this case or did something in the paper indicate the demographics of the researchers?.,SRSFeminism,cqwadgz,3,t5_2tedd

5279286,0,t3_3nb2ud,he seems to make good points but delivers them in a way that might be loaded  and even extreme so i dont think he might be an interlocutor to be taken  in good faith would be interested in some objective assessment of his claims and observations his rhetorical tricks cognitive biases.  i just finished watching the video  i am interested in looking into this for myself since that apparent rise of reactionary thought is wearing me down and i want to know what is going on  but i thought it could be of interest here or somewhere else if you think of another place where a good discussion could happen.,SRSFeminism,cvmhn5l,1,t5_2tedd
