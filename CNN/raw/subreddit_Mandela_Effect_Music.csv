9891452,0,t3_5g8765,This version sounds so ebonicy like hes really black. The original was sung in very soft ebonics.Also he now does a cool draw for air right before the lyric rhythm  this lyric is definitely not part of the original song. I used to sing this song and it was beat. Rhythm does not make as much sense when used with metronome.,Mandela_Effect_Music,dawvnwg,1,t5_3fc98
