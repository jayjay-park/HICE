1268463,0,t3_28m2gw,I usually love most jdramas that are highly rated and recommended but oddly this was one I never liked and I dont know why. ,JDorama,cicbhc1,3,t5_2rjrp
3087280,0,t1_cohw3s0,theyve made  one in  with jine storyline  and last year they did the shishio storyline split into  films...all of them are amazing imo,JDorama,cohztn3,1,t5_2rjrp

4127010,0,t1_crqpawb,oh and i forgot Sutekina Sen Taxi about a guy who runs a time travel taxi even my super tranformers obsessed nerd friend loved that one. And for humor if her plays video games and like monty python then Yuusha Yoshihiko to Maou no Shiro its basically a modern Japanese holy grail that takes its parody from anime computer games and fantasy quests in general.,JDorama,crqpcku,2,t5_2rjrp
6163026,0,t1_cypashu,In that case I would suggest watching Switch Girl on Crunchyroll. I got a lot of good laughs out of it and became a fan of the lead actress. I forgot to say it has  seasons make sure you watch season  first. Its hidden under a cut just in case you miss it.,JDorama,cyq68ee,1,t5_2rjrp

7623694,0,t3_4jfeac,Hmmm....I cant think of too many. Mostly Reverse Harem come to mind. Love That Makes You Cry  Despite that title it is NOT a tragedy!Lets Eat  is Korean but all the ladies develop a thing for the fasttalking lead.Kimi ni Todoke is a movie and the whole school is in love with the guy.  In particular a super popular girl and a shy girl. I normally only really consider it to be a true harem show if at least  main characters are in love with the lead but there arent nearly as many liveaction harem series with male leads. I see that far more often in manga and anime. ,JDorama,d38ruqx,2,t5_2rjrp

9140433,0,t1_d8aaqhn,Eh? Are you talking about the final part where he tells the police that Ryo was doing the nasty stuff? XD Because in that case he himself decided to go to the police its not that they found him. D,JDorama,d8am6hm,2,t5_2rjrp
10894557,0,t3_5vjlu9,Yeah she kinda fell off the wagon after  Litre of Tears you can tell by the  year gap. The only one of her dramas I sort of watched was Yokoso Wagaya e and it had a pretty neutral ending for Erikas character I think? It was so boring I couldnt finish it and just fast forwarded through most of it tbh. I think she doesnt go for happy dramas... ,JDorama,de3p2of,2,t5_2rjrp
11480888,0,t1_dfwg5kz,Not to be off topic but there are flairs on the sub. About to get my keiko kitagawa erika toda masami nagsawa yui aragaki on  ,JDorama,dfxctju,2,t5_2rjrp
