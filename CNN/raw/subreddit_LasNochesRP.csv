2869618,0,t1_cnsyhhz,Isabella MoraOh yes Ricco! This man here is The Young Sir. Or so Isabella had dubbed him. I met him whilst waiting outside. I think it may been his first time at a ball so be nice to him Okay? Kay. She went through all of this while gracefully leaning to the side to avoid one of their attackers strikes. The sudden miss unbalanced him for a second giving Isabella enough time to lightly slash across his back. However with her being relatively weak and him having hierro she only managed to cut away at a bit of his shirt and make him more man. Insanely she stopped and curtsied to him as if they were actually about to engage in a dance. That move only earned her a swinging forearm to the chest one which sent her flying back into the cave wall. Bitch... The guard spat as he moved to focus upon the other two that his partners were already engaged with. Both Luca and Ricco would have certainly been met with a rush. The one facing Ricco almost flickered out of existence until their blades clashed and froze like two unstoppable forces. Sparks were scattered across their battle around even as Isabella was dancing about prehit. Luca on the other hand was met with an attack of a different kind. His opponent wasnt quite as brash as his partner and new a ready stance when he saw one. So instead of a full on assault he merely raised his blade and charged a ball of red light on its tip. The accompanying sound was something heard rather often in the menos forest as the beasts struggled to control their own power but it was relatively rare to find Arrancar skilled enough to harness such force.A second later and most anything in his vision had been obliterated in a rush of red energy. Isabella couldnt see it but she could certainly feel it from where shed been hit to. She sighed as sweet memories of her husband came rushing back. Im so glad I came to this ball...,LasNochesRP,cnu9ylz,1,t5_31kxe

Luca was only being halfthreatening but part him was actually thinking about it.Dear Tacitus he said to the monitor as he kicked the Queen into one of the cellsplease let me in the ruffians out here are a little loud.And as for Florencia she seemed to be quite good at keeping the hear off of us last time that I was wondering if its be good to have a temporary meat shield on hand.  She seems to have a bit of a bloodthirsty attitude though may have to keep her in check at some point.,LasNochesRP,colt0sc,1,t5_31kxe
3248376,0,t1_coyo3tk,Hiroko Quite so but you must have some plan a leader can not work without an adviser much like a without a hand to prop it up while in thought. Ah thank you Zorra.Hiroko turned to take the glass of milk that she had returned with she herself munching on a cookie with a look of bliss. Looking back at Levialle and taking a sip from the cup Hiro nodded approvingly before returning to the conversation.Hiroko So then Levialle this Corazon you speak of why have I not heard or seen him at this event I would think the man of the hour would be at the center of attention... and not one of his supposed... underlings.Hiroko adding the last word with a very slight tone of disbelief in the way he said it.,LasNochesRP,coypbai,1,t5_31kxe
3436935,0,t1_cpk0pb6,Amon ran his hands against the wall to study it. In all his time in Hueco Mundo he hadnt seen anything like it. He began to wonder who could have dug out this cave. He wasnt sure if a hollow could do such a thing if they did they would have to show more intelligence than the adjuchas who tried to eat him. It suddenly hit Amon that he might possibly be in the home of whatever dug out this cave. He quickly began to look around the cave for a way to escape.,LasNochesRP,cpk1b4u,1,t5_31kxe
