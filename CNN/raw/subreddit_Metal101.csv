885346,0,t3_248vbs,I have a pair of these that I really like. Apparently theyre advertised as noise canceling which I didnt know until two minutes ago. They dont cancel much noise at all except in the way that turning your music up really loud will drown most things out but theyre good headphones with good sound.,Metal101,ch4x0s8,1,t5_2xqez

2498609,0,t1_cmk92xn,I can definitely see the similarity between the Swedish tone and stoner tones. Doesnt Jus Oborn use an HM as part of his tone? I could be wrong. On a side note Im really enjoying that Horrendous track. I had never really made an effort to check them out before but this is quite pleasant. The screamer sounds just like Martin van Drunen. ,Metal101,cmkpg05,2,t5_2xqez

8456291,0,t3_4vhswl,They were black metal. Essentially at least. We now refer to this era as First Wave Black Metal and at that time BM was just an aesthetic and not really a separate genre. It wasnt until the Second Wave late s early s that BM became a separate genre defined by a certain style of playing. Its worth remembering that music usually evolves organically and genres are usually post hoc distinctions that we apply retroactively. Extreme metal death black and their derivatives mostly evolved out of thrash in the early to mid s. Early examples of extreme metal appear to blur genre lines and can be hard to classify in retrospect because those genre distinctions didnt really exist yet. Or at least not like they are thought of now.,Metal101,d5ykkp3,3,t5_2xqez
