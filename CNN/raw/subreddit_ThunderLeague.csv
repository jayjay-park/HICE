We did use hair and cloth physics on our previous character model so I am sure we could use it this time as well  Dont forget that we currently have working physics acting upon the environment  We currently have a very skilled animator working on our character animations so well have to speak with him about whether or not he wants to animate hairbeards or if we should let the physics do the job! ,ThunderLeague,cwf7i3z,2,t5_39hk8

Ive been working on building better topology for quite some time now and its nice to hear that my practice pays off.Hope I could be of help! If you need more topology references I have some other workfiles lying around from different school projects ,ThunderLeague,cwg0zc5,1,t5_39hk8
