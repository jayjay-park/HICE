4531020,0,t1_ct1q741,Respectfully I believe the content of your question is an answer to it. If you need upfront capital to invest but have none you can either invest your current net worth or borrow to bolster your net worth before investing. Its a selfevident reality that individuals who possess few assets have a longer road to increasing their net worth than those starting with a higher net worth all other things being equal. The question is ethically and financially are you willing to leverage through borrowing to expedite the increase in net worth. Its a difficult and riskfilled decision that you should weigh carefully. I feel like my points are selfevident but since you asked directly I felt it was appropriate to share. I will provide some additional thoughts regarding best practices for lowasset starters but as I hope you know already these thoughts are the culmination of research on this forum and elsewhere. Best wishes for safely increasing your net worth over the longrun. ,FinancialPlanning,ct1rqtb,2,t5_2qwze

7154167,0,t1_d1qenr9,Thank you.  Like you mentioned groceries are a bit lower and they will eventually go up if traveling stops.  My local grocery store consistently runs a  off  and that coincidentally is the cheapest fresh produce and vegetables.  I have a stockpile of supplements so when I run out I may need to add another category for that as well. Thanks for your idea about discussing expenses further in detail with my girlfriend.  I have mentioned it in passing but setting some goals for future life events would be good to have.  We currently have a generic plan if possible I would like your opinion on that as well. She will move in with me at the end of the year but she will then have another  month coop working full time without pay so expenses will go up another body living here and the income will not. Budgets all raise but still stay within the current income without adjusting my Roth. Then she has  month practicum working full time and only making just above minimum wage. We discussed to have all of that go to her grad school debt of k her Bachelors degree is paid off with help of her parents and also with her working  jobs.  We will keep the same budget. Then  year after she moves in she will finally get a full salary which will be around k.  Since we have been living with one income and hopefully got our expenses and budgeting all straight.  The plan is to continue to live off of the same amount of money of  a month.  We each will raise our Roth to  without company match and I will put the remaining in accounts no specific order investing larger emergency fund upgrade car travel dog in the future and save for kids.  Sorry for the long read.  Is there anything you think we should add to the list of things to save for or unexpected turns that we could potentially come across?  Again any comments or feed back would be appreciated.  ,FinancialPlanning,d1rcw8b,1,t5_2qwze
7193368,0,t3_4df5uf,Most of the suggestions I read from rpersonalfinance would recommend dropping your k to max out what work matches then put whatever else more in another investment. Generally the k growth is less than you can achieve on your own. Something to consider.If your WiFi is so slow you dont use it would it not be cheaper to just pay for better internet and drop your data usage down then use the WiFi? Why not cache your music library so you dont use data to listen all the time. Does your work not supply a network to mooch off of during.Anyways another thing I read a lot is that while stock is cool your are much safer with index funds over individual companies. Less risk less reward though.Im bias and dont drink do I cant comment on the booze budget more than OH look an easy way to save  bucks.Check out planet fitness they seem to be EVERYWHERE and only run  bucks a month plus  a year.My last random comment is a bit random but my wife likes to do it. Set up different bank accounts to do different things. We leap around to the banks that pay you to open account with direct deposits. For example Chase pays for our rent only. Huntington pays for our daycare only. My credit union pays for our car and cell phone. PNC pays everything else. It seems odd but it is nice knowing there is only one bank account with variable costs and if it gets low all the major things are safe since their numbers are elsewhere. On top of that safety net every one of them gave up  bucks for pretty much nothing.I lied my last comment is to set aside money for the first month of your lady moving in. She is going to want some extra things to girl the place up and it will give you time to set up a new budget for new bodies.,FinancialPlanning,d1vtrq5,2,t5_2qwze

8920407,0,t3_523fig,A junior advisor is one of the most important positions for an advisor that wants to expand their business.  Youve been hired and groomed to to handle C and D clients do paperwork communicate with clients and handle their needs all so the head advisor doesnt have too.  You likely have goals of being the partner or head advisor but you likely wont be for a long time  years.  As realist said expect a salary of kk.  If you start collecting advisory fees or earning a commission your salary will likely go down.  Pay for junior advisors is often incentivised low salary base with potential for more through bonuses.   Dont expect the advisor you work for to give you clients.  A book of clients take time to build and is incredibly valuable even if it is a book of C and D clients.  At some point you may want to become your own advisor at which point you will have to start assembling your own book of clients.  You can either advertise like mad or buy a book of clients from a retiring advisor.  If you do the later you will have to pay for that book of clients meaning your could be working for  years with no income.  I think this is the reason there is such a big age gap in this industry.Ive been a paraplanner in an independent practice for  years now.  Id say this business is  education  sales  running a business.  This industry can be very rewarding both financially and spiritually.  Youll never stop learning.  You have to be willing to run a business.  You can do a lot of good work for people and they will be incredibly great full.  But at the same time clients have short memories when their portfolios dont do well and they will quickly forget all the effort and coaching youve done for them.  The financial advisory landscape is changing now more than ever.  The advisor you work for may not be worried about robo advisors but you should be.  Your first clients will be your piers they are the ones looking at robo advisors and cheaper solutions like Vanguard.  A retiring baby boomer probably wont even talk to you.  ,FinancialPlanning,d7k3p31,1,t5_2qwze

For example  if you are booking stock losses  then bookinig them today may be better because most stocks naturally rise so a stock today at  per share might be worth . next year thus reducing your loss.Also once you sell the loser  have a plan for the money.

10508487,0,t1_dcz4d7i,Be wary of this advice. Many more factors go into choosing how to invest. If you dont know why youre choosing what youre choosing then you can get into a bad situation.You need to determine your ability and tolerance to risk and your timeframe to invest.If you need the money within  years put it into a high yield savings account. years? Some sort of CD. years? Roth IRA then brokerage account with an asset allocation appropriate to your ability and tolerance for risk.Retirement? k Roth IRA or other taxadvantaged vehicle.Medical? HSA.And so on. If you really have no clue what youre saving it for but you want to do something with it put it into a Roth IRA with a Vanguard Target Date fund. Itll be able to be used for retirement and you can withdraw your contribution if something else comes up in the meantime.There are many places to put your money before a brokerage account that give you some sort of advantage.,FinancialPlanning,dcz8y4p,2,t5_2qwze

Focus on what you can control being discipline low fees contributions portfolio construction controlled discretionary spending.  Returns will be unpredictable we dont really know how news and events will affect the market until it actually does.  ,FinancialPlanning,ddl3hjj,3,t5_2qwze

As said below its just a rule of thumb but can be helpful to decide what a safe budget is for essentials.  It suggests  for necessities.  The  at the end is for personal expenses...I just look at savings as a personal expense and try to do as much as I can do there too...but that fits my goals.

11438734,0,t1_dfsk91x,Heres how I use our budget as a married guy in my s I write down every single payment we have to make throughout the month and stagger the payments so that we dont have everything come do at once. I sync this up with when we get our paychecks. That way I dont have k going out while k comes in. It also gives me an idea of what I have left over at the end of the month. So if I have  in expenses but bring in  then I know what I have leftover for things that I want. If I need a new car I know what I could afford in a payment etc.It also helps me keep an eye on how much Im investing every month. I try and shoot for about  to  of my income.Ive been keeping a household budget for us since I graduated college around  and have updated it about once a year. You would be amazed at how many people have no idea what their incoming and outgoing cash looks like every month. Not knowing can make it very tricky to make big financial decisions when you need to. This strategy has helped us save aggressively while spending comfortably. Im not a financial professional so this strategy keeps me in my comfort zone. Edit TLDR I feel more incontrol of our financial future having a budget. ,FinancialPlanning,dfskiom,2,t5_2qwze
