8113758,0,t1_d4s1y94,Yeah they were just templates i can swap the colors arround as i wish. Migh still do grey background ill look into changing the text colors. I dont really know why i picked yellow back when i changed the separation bars color but i think ill stick to it on that part to match the text glow maybe that was the reason to begin with. I dont really want to look too much into it because if i start changing colors im going to drive myself crazy.Oh green glow looks pretty cool aswell what about purple? maybe if i do green text and blue lines it will look better... I would never end changing stuff althouhg i made this thread to help me make choices,urealmslfg,d4s25xu,1,t5_3f6o9
