7322168,0,t3_4fnyl5,Id suggest focusing your team on thrust since you have a ton of  for that. Remember you can always make multiple teams I have all  of my team slots filled up with different configurations of teams.Id go between slash thrust and spell I know luke is a slashspell rutee is a thrustspell and anise is a slashthrust so you can alternate leaders like that between different teams. I know you said you dont have any  for spell but a max LB  is just as good as a base  and you have a ton of   spell units. Your anise team could be a sweeper team which basically focuses entirely on attack and takes out the enemy before they have a chance to hit you. For that focus on your most powerful slashthrust and make sure you have good shape changers in your sub skills to create a full board of one shape to do maximum damage output.Rutee team can be a tank team which focuses on maintaining health for higher level enemiesbosses that deal a lot of damage. Rutee boosts the RCV of spell types which also inherently have the highest base RCV so that will help a lot. Plus having anise there as a sub for her LP heal HP skill even tho shes a slash would also help.Also for maximum multiplier potential Id pay attention to what hidden elements your party has and what elemental weapons you have. Say if youre going up against a water enemy with anise lead a  shot wind unit with a wind weapon is .x damage as opposed to even a  slash water unit with nonelement weapon is still going to only be .x damage. If you max out the potential on the multipliers you could theoretically have anise lead  slash wind unit with wind weapon vs a water enemy which would be .x dmg  for hidden element x .x dmg for weapon x .x dmg for leader skill  .x dmg.Sorry for the block of text Ive been playing since USA release. my team is still pretty weak since Im saving up LP for my faves so Ive been trying to arrange my party for maximum multiplier stats despite having low base stats so Ive thought about this a lot haha.,TalesofLink,d2ahar4,2,t5_31ioi

7877574,0,t3_4n70qw,Do you have a mystic arte? My best strategy so far has been to raise my HP as high as possible but also to purposefully not max out on my attack. Why? Well it seems after a certain hp threshold Vargas starts doing his tile attack and after another hp thresholdafter a certain amount of time vargas starts his big charge attack. What i do is literally just build LC asap without doing too much damage to trigger his tile attack most fights he never uses it at all and then I have a tile changer at  LC so usually I can tile change to a mystic arte which has almost always OHKO Vargas at that point.I also have a few useful units Arte healers kratos Bride Sara shadowed judge yuri his arte delays by .

Unless you have a lot of armor youll end up with maxed out armor way before you have your set of SR max LBd weapons.Armor gear below SR is mostly useless in my humble opinion with a few exceptions such as Lamellar Leather increases earned gald niche use Feather Cloak provides an upgradeable protection against sleep and Chalt Liberator Arena reward provides  RCV heal per kill.On the other hand SR armor is pretty damn good and you should definitely keep it around and if possible LB and SR it.The reason why I say R armor and below are basically pointless is the main reason to equip armor is to hunt bighuge fish Ares Realms to some extent HoH Key of Weapon... and against this kind of fish the bonus from R Armor is just plain not enough.,TalesofLink,d4j4uiu,2,t5_31ioi

8093731,0,t1_d4pswi8,Yea Bandai doesnt care about global balance....lol if they did they would have given us the game exactly the same as JP with untouched stats and the same characters.But they figured they couldnt do that with global because its all about money Tales is a niche series here growing but still niche and this game is a cash grab. Global wouldnt make money like JP would still doesnt unless they gave you reasons to play the gacha and burn money.If global players were allowed to just use their favorite characters with  stars even being useful stll they would make less money so they balanced with their checkbook in mind by making  of  stars useless nerfing RCV making an ENTIRE CLASS pretty much useless and its funny Shot characters pop up very often in multipulls and make Arte Healers gacha locked. They even went so far as to nerf certain Gacha our current Summer Gacha is inferior to JPs which had all  and aboveThe recent buff of Asbel to Arte Heal status Global only btw only cements that they only care about money wih our server...because without him being an arte healer in a server dominated by them most people would see the Swim gacha as useless.,TalesofLink,d4pt3tq,3,t5_31ioi

If the tiers stayed the same and the number of people were more evenly divided wouldnt that make it easier? Yes Vargas was a good UR MA. What I dont know is how often that sort of thing comes around. Im not familiar with the Japanese release. If that was a oneshot deal people who started after the collab wont have that chance.

8249345,0,t3_4scsku,This is a nice writeup. It also tells me that the moment I get back to school I should stop trying to rank anymore since I wont have that free time. Im interested in the gel statistics ! And I suppose its S gels? because for this SA I made it a point to not use a single gel Stocking up cause Im FP here. This resulted in me ranking up about  times with me grinding on Tues Thurs and Sat on KoW dungeons. I placed  and had .mil mana this way but I probably took  over hours over the week to do so. Being able to use Auto Battle to grind ranks makes this possible.Also I run Splash team with Reala lead so no auto battling the HoH SA runs for me. Did every battle manually and cringed whenever I made a mistake and got killed for it Usually its LC problems but I once died to the Eyeballs tile attack.

8850016,0,t1_d7bmk5y,I was like you one week ago...you should try to rank on Soul Arena and get the SRUR Mystica Arte and if you can farm up until the UR you might get another Edna which is really interesting for MAs. I was able to clear HoH with SR MA Alisha  from the previous arena.  If that you are not able to beat it after that then the problem might be on your lineupgear.  You can use the free Sorey so all your chars get the hp buff and you gain survability.  The strat was easy Farm LC until I was able to use Judith Skill to get full triangles then Edna and then Alisha MA boss was around  for that point. I was around  of succes with that. After few runs I was able to get a ur core and from there was even easier.  Now thanks to the UR MA for GE Edna and GE UR gun  I can beat Chaos so keep trying!Edit Also look for friends in the weekly thread who are running with healers and ask if they might accept you so you can beat Gawain I bet they will be more than happy to help.

8881698,0,t1_d7ei9po,Honestly I think in your case you should concentrate in improving you attack first.Dont get me wrong HP is very important for Chaos or Ares but hereChaos Gawain most dangerous attack is also the easiest one to avoid. On the other side even if he doesnt have any desperation attack per se his ability to regenerate can become extremely problematic if you cannot finish him.IMHO you should try to optimize your finisher unlock all its passives and level up GE Edna Arte Healing to level  get the UR or better if you can MA if you can farm the weapon key to have a full LB SR Wind weapon. SR weapons from the keys are better than SR GE weapons. Then use the damage calculation sheet to check how much damage you can do with a double boosted MA.If you cannot reach  million damage around  would be much better I would say that you chance of successfully farming Chaos are very limited. ,TalesofLink,d7fgdkf,1,t5_31ioi

8954020,0,t1_d7nxapu,Youre welcome. The math in this game is indeed quite strange.WeaponArmorDouble boosts and Strength are applied after Forcefulness and only to the stats of the base weapon. They dont take the other passives into their calculation.When we equip a guy like Kor with a  ATK Heritage Its exspected that Forcefulness  Weapon Boost  and Double boost  multipliers stacks like Tile Type boosts in the game but in truth it doesnt. They are additive.Total increase is Atk Forcefulness    of base   Atk Weapon Boost    of base   ATK Double Boost    of base   ATK |   ATK base  ATK cThat is also the reason why our Anise is weaker than Kanonno P. at the moment.Oh ya each Weapon has to be calculated individually.Sorry didnt meant to babble you with math. ,TalesofLink,d7o5183,2,t5_31ioi

If you need a finisher obviously Sara is better but with the mana nestden out ranking is going to be difficult if you cant clear either one.  Saras stats are less but Van has no MA and probably very little chance of getting one but he will show up nicely in events like Soul Arena.

I do keep SR MA since they hit for  Ibe never ranked top so they are nice to equip on secondary versions of my chars for farming purposes ie shot Mickleo and Trust Mickleo so I can MA if I want without having to move stuff around.

9230111,0,t1_d8lyhyd,Im inclined to say hawk one to .

9231279,0,t3_56pcg2,Posting my own opinion here on megathreads and moderation. Please feel free to comment since I do enjoy seeing varying perspectives.On ModerationPersonally I do think its worthwhile to take a more laissezfaire approach wherein we just remove reportedinappropriate posts e.g. NSFW spam. We could still post event threads and itd be up to users whether or not they want to make use of them. Of course there are pros and cons to this. The main ones that come to mind are PRO The abundance  frequency of posts would result in a more activelooking sub and its easier to see new threads as in contrast to new comments. CON If new posts do become very frequent some threads may end up being ignored. I understand some of you feel that megathreads result in a similar situation so perhaps the con isnt too bad.Also Im not really sure if this is a pro or a con but this approach would also mean that the subreddit will be much more dependent on community upvotesdownvotes. That said this is the standard Reddit approach and Im personally okay with it.On MegathreadsMegathreads are tough. When we didnt have megathreads we would receive complaints about spam and requests for creating megathreads. Now that we do have megathreads we receive complaints about the lack of posts invisibility of comments etc.On one hand they help us by reducing clutter and grouping similar posts together. This is a very personal opinion and Im sure some of you may disagree but I actually was tired of the abundance of posts that would pop up whenever a new summon was made available. Aside from the congratulatory remarks those types of threads dont really warrant much discussion. Yes you could argue that people could talk about a particular unit but consider the case where multiple people post about pulling the exact same thing. I dont think youd find meaningful unit discussion in each one of those threads. xFurthermore some people may want to share their good fortune but dont feel the need to create a new thread for it. I would argue that megathreads do provide an outlet for people in these situations.ProposalThat said I do agree that redirecting the majority of posts to megathreads is a bit much. As such I propose replacing our current set of threads with a regularlyrotating set of megathreads. For example Meme Mondays Account Trading Tuesdays ??? Wednesdays Teambuilding Thursdays Friend Request Fridays Salty Saturdays Sweet Sundays Tuesday and Thursday could be swapped. Thursday is the earliest date following maintenance so people could talk about how new units may fit into their team. However Tuesdays may be better if new summons dont pop up until Friday  Monday.I think this would be a good compromise in that we still keep some megathreads but also allow enough leeway to post about whatever else youd like. In addition the frequency at which the threads show up  disappear would mean that content would always be new to a degree and youd also miss out on very little if you decide to ignore select ones. NoteSubreddits can only support two stickied threads at any given time. If we introduce the system above itd likely replace one of the stickies we already have. Our current setup is that the QampA thread is always the topmost sticky whereas the second sticky is reserved for ingame events.How do you as a community feel about replacing the QampA thread? Or would you prefer keeping the QampA thread but replace the ingame event thread instead?Okay thats all from me for now. Gotta go back to doing other work. ,TalesofLink,d8m4rqf,2,t5_31ioi

And yes I do have AsuMilla in the correct element too. Sadly I do not have either Kratos or Keele. I think I might have burned them when I was still new to the game and didnt realize how useful they would be later on.Quick Edit I just beat  with your advice just without the Arte Healers and Delayers.

9839680,0,t1_daq217i,Okay. I cant really see why you would be struggling on that particular mission  maybe theres some sort of fundamental misunderstanding here.Are you building up LC doing a tile change and using an MA on the boss?  You might want to avoid using Duke as a leader since he can lead to problems if your HP drops too low.  Also you should definitely include that  Kratos since you dont seem to have any other arte healers.Depending on how your team is geared out Veigue might not be a very good choice for healing  hes very efficient on high HP numbers but if all you need is a little nudge to get you back over half so that you can do big damage again someone like Mysterious Dandy Raven is a better choice.Honestly you should pretty much be able to run a party like Duke Mysterious Dandy Raven Cheer Colette Unshaken Resolve Estelle  KratosAnd then whoever the heck you feel like practically and beat this level.  Just target enemies that are going to attack first and do long chains to kill them or if you dont have any long chains try NOT to kill them by using a short chain that sets up a long chain. The objective is to have  LC and no stars or hearts on the board or at least relatively few in good positions to clear by the time you reach the boss.  Then get Estelle on the board use Colettes tile change and do Estelles MA game over for the badguys.,TalesofLink,daq4t9t,3,t5_31ioi

When I was haivng really bad nights people on discord talked me calm and helped me with the stress. Hwatsons discord as intangable as it is means a lot.Now it feels like I have to pick sides and who knows if Ill be able to stay and chat with the same people. This is going to create a lot of bad blood and honestly its upsetting me more than I thought it would. I guess I assumed that things would still be in the same place I left them when I got to come back after the new year. From the PoV of someone who hasnt been around a lot due to RL issues this looks as if there was one more area of the community that you couldnt stand not being able to micromanage and its really pushed me away from both the discord and this reddit.,TalesofLink,dbc4p0a,7,t5_31ioi

10240415,0,t1_dc4owi0,Nest should be more than doable with your box. SA teams are fairly simple. You can run something like this Either Fractured Milla or Duke lead Sheena or Nitoa sub Either a tile changer such as GM Rita or an active heal such as Clash Kana  units that either have high damage or high health      Arte healers like Anni Sara and Saleh are very useful for both their healing as well as their  single hit arte      Include at least one high damage unit with an advantageous element to use as a finisher against the dragon the more the betterNote You need to do  damage to oneshot a Rare Mana Eater and  damage to oneshot a King Mana Eater. You can check how much damage your units will do by holding onto your chain and looking at the numbers that pop up above your units heads  if its just a bunch of s then you wont break through defense unless you proc an arte or something.It doesnt matter if your Duke isnt MLB cause his .x leader skill is just as potent at level  as it is at level . If you have a lot of full board change friends such as Elza HW Kongwai or Anni Leon Duke might be better for his higher damage and you can just toss armor on him to give you a little more HP. F Milla is also a great SA leader since she provides both high damage and a cheap tile flip even though her multiplier is only x.If you decide to bring an active healer keep in mind that the heal is only for emergencies you dont really have time to build up LC in Nest. I highly recommend finding friends who have Link Boost to ensure that you have enough to tile flip at the dragon though this isnt mandatory. You can use Barbatos friends if you want but I think itd be easier to just use two gt leads. If you want more friends to help you out also check out the friend request thread and leave a note.If youre not a fan of glass cannon leads you should be able to clear it using Anni Sara as a lead too running two . HPATK rainbow leads. Youd still bring SheenaNitoa and a tile changer as subs and fill the rest of your team with a mix of high damage and high health units.,TalesofLink,dc4t3sr,2,t5_31ioi

10479605,0,t1_dcvue14,Hmm the main reason to do s instead of s is if there is a good guarantee. A guarantee is like the  star hero chance up you see on top of the  stone roll in the MA summon. Good guarantees are guarantees like xFeatured Hero or Increased Chance of  star. It changes from banner to banner. ToL  star rate is  which is higher than some other mobile games. However our pool of  star units is large and of course there are some that are worse than the others.If you are unsure of other mechanics you can ask around or you can look under the Resources and Guides at the bar at the top. ,TalesofLink,dcvyzgz,1,t5_31ioi

10481708,0,t1_dcw0ktl,The problem is that the game has now set precedent for arbitrarily ignoringoverriding card skills as it sees fit  weve had a couple recent antiBarbatos stages and by extension all other cards with lesser LC up skills. So you can pretty well bank on future events featuring bosses that piercebypass survival shield card skills. Sorry if Im being a wet blanket but Ive played plenty of other FP CCG games of this ilk that do the same type of thing  release cards that are game changers at first but then when people arent spending enough real money anymore on stonesgemsdiamondsetc. to clear difficult stages or slow down on buying more cards the devs indirectly nerf the cards with stages that void their skills.,TalesofLink,dcw7ke8,1,t5_31ioi

11533133,0,t1_dg397qy,It depends on the hero  usually the rule of thumb for summon units is keep them unless theres a really good reason to LB them.  For units from events it varies  SA units you will want to keep separate until you have good elemental coverage.  Clash event units on the other hand are designed to be limit broken because you can get lots of them.The advantage of having several of one unit when its a good one like Eleanor is that its actually often easierbetter to use multiples of one  for example given the choice between three copies of Eleanor who are all Thrust units and one Eleanor and two other healers one slash and one shot you have a much greater variety of leader options available to you if you just need to be sure you include Thrust while if your three healers are thrustslashshot you need a leader who boosts all three of those to get the most out of your units.This is of course on top of the benefit of having three arte healers who all have a chance to heal you instead of one with a chance to heal you for a little bit more.In general the units you should try to avoid Limit Breaking at almost any cost are Arte Healers Arte Delayers Link Boost units or at least units with Link Boost above  or so Lucky Healing units Especially Lucky Healing ,TalesofLink,dg3a6ww,2,t5_31ioi

Cheap tile changer allgt tile changers are nice to have the cost is usually LC so units with LC cost are very good now also gt tile changers for LC or lower are pretty nice. Cheap support skills like  HP recovery for LC k for LC etc. HP reduction skills like Barbatos TrampleEtc. Its all about the cost with active skills. The cheaper the better.Passives. Link boost. The higher the better. It allows you to start the fight with some LC very good for quick farming. Lucky healing. ATK boosting passives on finishers and arte healers. HP boosting passives on tanks units with high HP. Arte Plus  very desired on arte healers and delayersStats. High ATK stats on finishers units you have a MA for and arte healers. High HP on everybody else...high RCV is nice to have but nobody cares about it that much. Some strategies rely on RCV but its generally considered not very useful.So to sum it up... Yes arte healers are good.

It takes a bit longer but I do a tile flip Ednas boost and then a tile flip Ednas boostJudes boost to kill her without knocking her into desperation territory. Im fortunate enough to be able to ribbon everyone but my finisher and Yggy though which helps tremendously. ,TalesofLink,dgsyagv,1,t5_31ioi
