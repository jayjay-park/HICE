1265440,0,t1_cibxy13,I agree the sheer amount of research required to create a character is astounding and the path options being horrible horrible traps doesnt help have those even been updated recently? Who knows.I think something that could help in this regard would be a  heart given to every character once period not per life. This would at least enable a one time featskill point reset at no cost to the player. Honestly I would also propose a change to the very beginning of the game where a player is not asked to pick a class at all until after they reach korthos and can actually interact with other players. Giving those players a prompt to ask for advice in the advice chat would also help.Its been my experience that the majority of players are always willing to help others understand the nuances of the game and giving players such an option before theyre forced to decide what they want to be would be interesting at least.Even so look at games like Path of Exile. That game is thriving and has a system quite possibly more complex than this one does. And one far more punishing in that if you die your character is likely gone Hardcore ladders seemed the most popular when I gave it a try. The key is enabling the new players to ask questions before theyre forced to make decisions and ensuring they understand that those decisions can be changed to a certain degree.,ddo,cibz7um,3,t5_2r62z

3158742,0,t3_2wbw6d,Personally? I do it to run with friends. Ive met great people and I enjoy running with them. Ive got a good guild and I enjoy interacting with them. Moreover as a tank I enjoy being able to stare down a dragon or a goddess or what have you and laugh as they try and fail to kill me. The guild system is what you make of it of course but it is more easily accessed than some other MMOs that Ive played. The built in voice chat is one of the games better features in that it encourages you to talk to the people youre running with first to figure out how to do the quests but even better to socialize with people youre becoming friends with. The general demographic of players is skewed to an older generation than you would find in your average MMO. At  years old Im the baby of almost every group I run with. That generally allows for a more mature player base which makes the game less toxic than Ive seen in other MMOs. For the most part the player base is generally willing to help and since most of them received advice from more experienced players in the past there willing to pay it forward to new players.Beyond that? New content is always fun and while they dont produce Expansions all that often they do have moderately regular Updates that will in addition to changes in various and sundry mechanics often include new content.Ive met people who create gimp characters rolling a die in game to see what class to take at the next level. Others will play permadeath characters where if they die then they have to delete the character and start over. Some of those will role play their characters in that if their character cant detect something then the player cant apply prior knowledge of the the dungeon from previous characters to warn people of whats upcoming.,ddo,copegqp,7,t5_2r62z

3430853,0,t3_2zgmid,Ive got a first life Dwarven PaladinFighterFVS  and it does pretty well.  The recent Paladin pass and armor up changes made a big difference.I run D.Axe and Tower Shield with Shield Mastery and THF feats...melee focused.  I can get overwhelmed soloing in EE but in EH or EN I rarely need to resort to casting heals at all.  The DPS against a single target isnt as good and with my Swashbuckler but this toon cuts through groups of mobs like nothing...nearly as fast as my PM does without the mana spend.  The big downside is that my save DCs are terrible but Im not casting offensive spells too often anyway.Id probably make some minor changes in hindsight but Im pretty happy with it overall.  Cleric vs FVS is kind of a wash I guess.  FVS is giving me a couple of resists some reflex save and more mana that I never use while cleric would give me more spells that I wouldnt cast and the ability to swap them out for other spells that I wouldnt cast.  I have no idea how my build compares to others.  I just know that I can solo anything EH up to a couple of levels above me and a lot of EE stuff.,ddo,cpjcd1w,1,t5_2r62z

Cleric  is also not that necessary any more for meleehealer given that Mass Heal has lost its usefulness.However it is still not good dps by any means. It is just good enough for soloing easier content without too much frustration especially with twisted Soundburst CHA save. Having two cleaves more melee power and Holy Retribution  a crapton of Exalted Smites makes it bearable. ,ddo,cr7wmu2,1,t5_2r62z
4421271,0,t1_csmrut0,A lot of people have started running in static groups solo heroic and epic content or only run with guild members. Im guilty of the first and the last of those and only put up an LFM when Im filling out a raid.,ddo,cso0gbb,1,t5_2r62z
4425330,0,t1_csi1fm4,Warlocks as a class are pretty poorly designed but they are only overpowered in some respects and very underpowered in others.Shining through is very overpowered in easy content and very inferior in difficult content.Generally speaking an epic level warlock will be getting  HP out of a cast of shining through with a  second cooldown. Once a character starts to reliably have more than  HP basically any reasonably built and geared player at epic levels this is not particularly more valuable than a  HP heal. However warlocks do not get any other very good method of self healing innately as a class and compared to other self healing methods this is very poor comparably due to the unusually long cooldown. For example any class built on a blade forged has superior self healing to this just from SLA Reconstruct and thats on a  second timer.Effectively if the enemies can NOT do more than  damage per  seconds Shining Through renders you invulnerable. If enemies CAN do it you are screwed. Top this off with the fact that Warlocks have very poor defensive capacity and generally defensively they are barely adequate on any EE content.Now on the offensive side they again suffer exactly the same problem. Their damage ramps up so quickly and powerfully in the early game that on heroic content they just devastate everything. Unfortunately once you get into harder epic content the DPS stops scaling while enemy HP only gets higher. The biggest downfall of the class is the things that were really OP early the bursts in the Enlightened Spirit tree are only really great if they can almost  shot enemies. Dual bursts plus an aura tick or two will kill almost any non boss preepic and that is extremely OP. Using the bursts however when enemies dont die so quickly is actually a DPS loss. This is due to the very poor way the interaction between using a warlock SLA and a warlock EB is designed. It is like how a strong melee toon does not want to cleave a single enemy the disruption to the basic attack sequence is larger than the gain from the cleave damage. In the same way sure the bursts do more damage than a regular Eldritch Blast shot but the DPS loss from the delay when you use them is more than you gain from their additional damage.Fundamentally what it comes down to is that at heroic levels and I suppose probably also on lower epic difficulties such as EN and possibly even EH to a degree Warlocks are mass AoE easy button  shot machines. Once on difficult content EE generally and most harder EH quests they become a weak nuking sorceror plus a DC wizard with half the spell points pool with only moderate survivability.I guess I can not blame them that much though really at this point in time compared to melee or ranged builds spell caster builds are currently very inferior. Pretty much the polar opposite to how things were back before MoTU when casters reigned supreme over melees.,ddo,csoi72f,2,t5_2r62z

4762412,0,t1_ctusccv,They have indeed but the devs have answered this by saying that when they did the complexity of the code they migrated was very different. Now with guilds TR cache and other elements that were not there on the past merge doing it now is harder.Apparently the LOTRO merge that is ongoing involved a dedication of their dev team to resolve namehouseitem issues. The current voluntary merge has characters leaving their old server and going to the new one with a clickie in their pack that magics all of their stuff into the new server and wipes from the old.That being said. In the age of virtualized infrastructure that we live in I cant believe that the term server relates to a physical box somewhere and more a loadbalanced pool of virtual machines.

Right now Im going to try a pure defensive Cleric healing build that uses reactive heal  Aura  the EA Mass CMW SLA  PE Burst  Divine Wrath in EA for the primary heals with Cure crit and heal as backups when MCMW is on cooldown. combine that with Towershield and the other shield feats to make it more survivable plus a high  PRR and MRR and you have a toon that survive in high reapers while hopefully being able to heal. Cure Focus and incredible healing will save SP by allowing for the use of Cure Crit or even Cure Serious depending on the toon. Ractive heal wont save toons form one shots when they are in the l range but a  heal that occurs off the global cooldown is good for tanks and good when partywide damage occurs. Plus it doesnt use spellpoints.And of course PE burst and Aura are good in tight quarters. Incredible healing and the EA cleric levels helps with PE Burst as well.  you can get PE burst up to level    for cleric levels  for EA  for Incredible HealingI have no idea if this build will work time will tell. But I do think a dedicated healer will be a boon in Reaper including raids.,ddo,ddj3avk,2,t5_2r62z

Use that time to figure out what class you want to play!Healing isnt mandatory because most classes have some kind of self healing. The only class that had trouble healing is fighter and even then they have work arounds. The new reaper mode released last patch does require a healer. Reaper mode is for veteran players so dont worry about that just yet You can ruin a character but dont be afraid! This game has a reincarnation system so once you reach  you can roll back to level  with bonus stats and try again. Play what you think is best or check to forums for a build guide! There are lots of good guides for new players,ddo,deuji67,3,t5_2r62z
