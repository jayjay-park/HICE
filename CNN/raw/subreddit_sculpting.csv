9182524,0,t3_55zde1,Hi Im new here myself.    edit  I forgot to wish you a happy Birthday!  I hope your most recent journey around the star we call Sol has been wonderful and I wish you many more to come! I just started playing with Sculpey oven bake clay at home.  Its really soft and kind of sticky it wont really dry out unless you leave it sit out for a really long time.  How I started is that I made some little rough figurines reminicent of the paleolithic Venus sculptures.  I mounted them and baked them solid  Recently Ive been making rough shapes of heads and then baking it until its mostly set up.  I then let it cool and set about scraping and shaping it with just a little exacto knife and various other implements like these wood carving tools which Ive sharpened on a grinder.This picture is my most recent work its one of the former U.S. presidents.    I uploaded a few more pix and you can see my progression on some of these.  It wont win me any awards but it relaxes me and I am just learning.  Good luck!,sculpting,d8fyaty,1,t5_2ssh8
