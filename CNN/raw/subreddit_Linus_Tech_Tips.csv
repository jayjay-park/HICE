6930760,0,t3_4ahdd5,I have a similar Supermicro unit with redundant w PSUs.  Each bank of PSUs will only produce w total either all from  PSU in event of failure but normally its balanced out between the  PSUs.You wont need a Hz plug because youll only need that juice in the event  of them fails.   hz youll have w available and the power distributor will limit the output to  anyway.  If one does fail the server will scream at you pretty loudly.  trust me I pulled one of of a production server while it was onIve never seen a SM psu fail even ones that are like  years old.  These machines are just so over engineered its insane.  ,Linus_Tech_Tips,d11xdn1,1,t5_2z915
