10554872,0,t3_5r53o7,Source videoand from Wikipediagt Leonard Coatsworth a Tacoma News Tribune editor was the last person to drive on the bridge bonus gif    Around me I could hear concrete cracking. I started back to the car to get the dog but was thrown before I could reach it. The car itself began to slide from side to side on the roadway. I decided the bridge was breaking up and my only hope was to get back to shore.    On hands and knees most of the time I crawled  yards or more to the towers . . . . My breath was coming in gasps my knees were raw and bleeding my hands bruised and swollen from gripping the concrete curb . . . . Toward the last I risked rising to my feet and running a few yards at a time . . . . Safely back at the toll plaza I saw the bridge in its final collapse and saw my car plunge into the Narrows.gt Only one life was lost in the collapse of the bridge. Tubby a cocker spaniel was the only fatality of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster he was lost along with Coatsworths car. Professor Farquharson and a news photographer attempted to rescue Tubby during a lull but the dog was too terrified to leave the car and bit one of the rescuers. Tubby died when the bridge fell and neither his body nor the car were ever recovered.,IdiotsNearlyDying,dd4ii32,9,t5_3i5un

11660457,0,t1_dggrs60,I remember this.  WARNING GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF DEATH  He wasnt just hiking he was looking for hot pots to do some soaking bent over to test the water temperature with his hand and slipped on the fine clay into a near boiling pool.  His sister was with him at the time and recording video on her cell phone to the best of my knowledge it has never been released that would be to much for me.  He not only died but the park service put off recovery of the body for a day and when they came back there wasnt enough left to recover anything.  In a very short order there was a significant amount of dissolving lt just an article no pictures.That is far to gruesome for this sub but it is pretty close to a Darwin Award because there are warning signs posted all over.Bonus story worthy of this sub.  Ive been to remote hot springs in my home state some of them on alkali flats many too hot for bathing.  I was with a partner and we had accepted the risk in doing this.  Because of the dissolved mineral content some hot pools are prone to crusting over so they may be quite large under the surface yet only have small holes open to the surface   We were very careful and did not get hurt in that way at all.   But while obsessing over this obvious danger I forgot some small details.  I was wondering why some pools had large sheets of algae the only thing that grew in some while others didnt.  I literally said this out loud while reaching down to feel the water in one of the pools that didnt  it is because the pools that dont are even hotter just under boiling OW.  Duh.  Myopically focused on the big danger while forgetting the small one classic Ridiotsnearlydying fortunately it was just a small burn and I never came close to slipping.,IdiotsNearlyDying,dghq7av,4,t5_3i5un
