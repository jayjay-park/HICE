5596663,0,t3_3rmiu7,About half the book is the features of the various notebooks including some of the covers. It goes over the features they all share then the Planner the Techo original and Cousin and the Weeks. Two pages on the extra pages in each book. Four pages of a timeline of the Hobonichi Techo.  tips and tricks for using. An interview with Shigesato Itoi. And it ends with info about the shop.Its nice but aside from the interview its all stuff you can find online either on the shop or various user groups.  ,hobonichi,cwqti98,2,t5_2ywdi
