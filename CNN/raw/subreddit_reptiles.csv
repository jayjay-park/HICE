I use the free US Postal service priority mail small boxes with the end open and more cardboard shoved inside that and stand them upright in the tupperwaresterilite tub. The cardboard I cut long side to side and bend it accordion style and stuff it up inside the boxes with the creases running vertically. Or just use some cut down egg cartons. One pack of eggs cut the carton in half and stuff it in the box. If the tupperware container is small enough you can even place it on the cool side of the beardie enclosure.,reptiles,cf9ne44,1,t5_2qy22

310747,0,t1_cfcxlqz,Uros need a LOT of heat and UVB  Id do a lot of research before taking one home.  If you can get one captive bred theyre really really freaking cool lizards but many of the easily available species are often originally wild caught.  While an experienced keeper often doesnt have problems with them for someone like yourself who doesnt have a ton of experience with wild caught animals they may be a bit too delicate for you.It would be worth it for you to look for a captive bred uromastyx and if you cant find one to wait rather than go home with a wild caught one.  Again theyre super neat but they can be tough for someone new to them. ulandsharkbait has given you a TON of really great advice  you may want to go with a nocturnal gecko species and build a gorgeous vivarium rather than another desert setup.  Good luck!  Enjoy the show.  If youre going to NARBC in Arlington here have a coupon for our booth if you wanna swing by.  Jen,reptiles,cfcz6x9,3,t5_2qy22

Not a reptile. You have to realize that they are very delicate creatures and if you irritate by unnecessary poking and prodding and picking up they can and will bite thrash around run away and potentially injure themselves or your kid depending on what exactly it is. Dont get a reptile if your intent is to take it out and play with it. They are great pets but they arent toys. That said there is a lot of value to having them as pets and they can be a great way to teach your kids responsibility and instill respect for nature.

1333850,0,t3_29co3l,Yeah..The reason people hate on sand is solid and logical.  In nature their habitat is mostly hard rocky area not loose sand.  You arent duplicating their natural life by having them live on loose sand.  Second dragons LOVE to smell with their tongue everything constantly its incredibly easy for them to ingest loose particle substrate which is not hard to stay in their tracts build up cause blockages and give your animal an excrutiatingly painful death.  Literally they cant poo so they have to vomit all their waste and will starve themselves to death.  You have its water bowl which is useless imo and food bowl ON SAND.  Very easy to mix its food up in the sand and eat more of it.  If you want to risk your animal with sand you should divide the tank in half half sandbox half tile or carpet.  And have all food and water on the tilecarpet side.  Its hard to judge size in this but the animal will spend most of its time basking or in the hot spot having your uvb on the opposite side is a bad idea you should have to two bulbs together.  Its another reason i prefer tube uvb over socket because i can cover the whole enclosure with a tube.And you might want to set up the hides so they flow better looks like they are both only accessable from one side and size wise probably going to give the animal a harder time turning in them.  I set mine up with both openings accessable.Please do some research into sand and why its a risk not worth taking.  Its like riding a motorcycle in shorts and flip flops.  Sure nothing bad might happen but if it does its a worst case scenario that never needed to be.,reptiles,cijoacv,3,t5_2qy22

2011738,0,t1_ckvlbqo,Well I breed leopards so I breed thousands but you can usually find a nice little walkthrough for setup. I keep them on oats as a substrate because they can lay eggs in then but I feed them what my beardie ets along with carrotskale Swiss chard any extra fruits or veggies. Basically anything nutritious will be carried over to your gecko so stuff like lettuce is useless to feed them. The mealies will cackle up then change into beetles and the beetles will after a couple weeks lay eggs in the oats. All told it takes  months to really start to get decent sized worms out of then though but once the mealie machine is rolling its usually continuous.Hopefully your gauge is just broken if youre gecko is having issues shedding then soaks are far better than high humidity. ,reptiles,ckvm0tm,1,t5_2qy22

Babies wont drown in a bowl if they can get in and out like any animal they just need the access in and out a deep porcelain bowl it cant get out of or touch bottom would kill any terrestial animal.  Misting  times daily is recommended by who?  Keeping the room at adequate humidity can be done without misting the animals and misting is needed by tropical and arboreal forest animals not desert.The only time misting would be needed would be for lack of humidity but misting the animals isnt the optimal route.,reptiles,cn1kt83,3,t5_2qy22

He was quite small he never ate nor drank. I switched him to live mealworms and the first day he was eating like a champ and gained weight. But yea get a new enclosure. It doesnt have to be expensive of course and you can find used ones for a good price depending on your location. Ive heard people use plastic tubs like the ones you use for storage.

4215652,0,t1_cs0akba,Itll work fine with a tub. You just need to get a low wattage light. Regular household incandescent bulbs put out a little heat. The lowest reptile heating type bulb Ive seen is  Watts and that gets warmer in a tub than a regular bulb due to the shape and reflective coating. They make clamp on lamps you could just attach to the side. There are also lamp stands thar you can hang your lamp on. These are nice because you can raise and lower the lamp to adjust the heat. LowerWarmer tub. HigherCooler tubPersonally Id start with a high wattage household incandescent light bulb in a black hooded lamp on a lamp stand. You can get the stand and lamp at most pet stores or online. If its still not warm enough you can go in for a reptile bulb.Heat will reduce humidity as the moisture evaporates off. If theres something like a water bowl in the tub it may increase humidity.,reptiles,cs0ro23,1,t5_2qy22

Both UV light and powder provide a starting supply of D which requires biochemical activation to have any effects. This process is pretty well regulated by several feedback mechanisms to prevent toxic levels from accumulating. Anecdotally my Savannah and Argus monitors have done fine with UV light and CaVitD powder on their food several days a week. Hope that helps!,reptiles,cw0coii,2,t5_2qy22

If you position it on cool side BTS will retreat there to cool down for the night and then this thing kicks in and he will have to move.

If you want try giving him a soak in a plain pedialytelukewarm water mix or actually giving him pedialyte via oral syringe which most local pharmacies will give you for free if you ask. Crickets are good but he looks too weak to take them. You can try but too many at once and he may get overwhelmed. Id try offering waxworms or mealworms waxworms being the preference to get his weight up. If you have the means and will to take him to a vet theres a nutrition supplement called Critical Care they can prescribe to help beef him up and give him high nutrients. You can syringe feed that as well.If you purchased him from a store regardless of local or chain I would call them up and complain. That type of treatment is not ok and furthermore it sounds like if you did obtain him from someone they did not adequately inform you that he was in poor health. You may be able to return the little guy per whatever the stores policy but given how hes currently doing that would likely be a sure death sentence since he likely ended up that way because of poor care though sickness is an option too.,reptiles,d09jlh4,6,t5_2qy22

Most general lizard advice regarding feeding size does not apply to them. You dont need to worry about feeding pray smaller than the size between their eyes. In fact they probably wouldnt eat it.They want to eat big pray. They figure out ways to jam it down their throat. They will crush and drag it along rocks to get pray in. It gives them exercise as well.  Thats not to say that there is no pray too big for them but you definitely want to feed them larger than average stuff. ,reptiles,d1dg0ev,1,t5_2qy22

8752684,0,t1_d6zpf3p,yup same here!  Id drag my little sister out with me to catch lizards and wed get dozens of em Id make lizard hotels by carting a bigass piece of plywood with some little riser blocks down to the field and there would always be something under it when the day started getting hot.  The bluebellies were always the most fun theyve got funny little personalities and they dont bite too much.  All of them would be let go within a month usually we always needed the cage space for something new.  for a while it was snakes  but Ive always liked my lizards more.OK storytime   One bluebelly I kept for years in my s because he was kinda disabled.  His name was Shotgun cause I found him stuck in a shotgun shell it was just the tube part and his front legs were pinned back with just his head sticking through   ..I dont know how long he was stuck like that before I found him but it looked like he had grown into it and it was super difficult to remove  his shoulders were too big to slip back out of it and his scales wouldnt allow it to come off that way either. and it certainly wouldnt fit past his fat belly either.   He still managed to scuttle around everywhere pretty fast with that thing on him and appeared to still be abe to find stuff to eat like that. I couldnt cut the thing off either it was so tight on him scissors were useless.  Eventually what I did was put him right up under the heat lamp to soften the plastic he didnt mind the heat either and then I used an xacto knife that Id heat up and gingerly slice into the shell just making real shallow cuts on the same vertical line until it was almost cut through just barely holding together.  then stuck im back under the lamp and in about  minutes he Hulked his way out of that thing. It was so cool to watch he like whipped it off of him and shook it off. everythign about him said fuck FINALLY!  His front legs never really came back fully though they were really skinny and always pointed back he didnt ever use them to run he just wiggled like a shark on his back legs. after a few months he eventually started climbing on stuff and could use his hands for that but when he rested  he would rest on his chest and not use his arms at all.   Well I just couldnt put him back outside in that state hed get picked off in a matter of minutes so Shotgun got a gallon aquarium and all the bugs he could eat.  Even brought him a couple girlfriends here and there but never got any eggs from them.I had him for about  years before he died kinda unexpectedly.  He was a boss motherfuckin blue belly though always looked like he was in max chill mode arms back. and he didnt do pushups just headbanged.  We listened to lots of slayer me n Shotgun.  I wish I had pics for you but this was when cameras and phones were still separate things and the pictures we had probably died with some horrible beige desktop long long ago.  RIP Shotgun the Chillest Blue Belly.,reptiles,d6zqqvj,8,t5_2qy22

9562576,0,t1_d9q632m,What was going on at work? Just busy with random stuff or was it anything particularly notable? Im doing reasonably well. Things are alright its definitely the calm before the storm. We still havent found anyone to take over the lease but I decided that if we dont have someone to take over the apartment lease by the th Im going to break it which costs a lot but Im so ready to be done with this situation. Since then shes definitely cleaned and helped a ton. A flat surface is great but just as important is that its a good work surface. I mentioned carpet because touching it can generate static electricity. If you accidentally shock computer components it can cause a lot of damage. In order to combat that touch the metal case of your macbook pro before you touch any of the internal components. That should ground you and prevent that from happening. First of all if you want to replace your optical drive with your HDD you need an adaptor. Heres an example that would work for you. What you want to do is back up your HDD take it out and replace it with your SSD. Then you want to take out the optical drive and replace that with the adaptorHDD assembly. Then you go install the mac os from scratch on your SSD you can basically just put the mac os install files on a flash drive and then boot from that and install it and then restore your data. After that you can go ahead and wipe the HDD so you have just one operating system installed on your computer. After youre done with all that instead of having one drive that you can save stuff on you get two. You can use that in a couple of ways  you could set up the HDD as a backup drive so you have a bit of redundancy for your data. Given that you still have a reasonable amount of space left over that might be a good approach. Alternatively if you do wind up with a lot of data you can use the HDD as a random storage drive and leave your SSD as your operating system drive. Thats how I usually configure my computers. Between upgrading the RAM adding a SSD replacing the dvd drive with your HDD reinstalling your OS and restoring your data Id say youre looking at maybe  hours in total? Thats just an estimate as I dont know how long the mac os takes to install. Sarahs not sleeping around in an attempt to provoke me  shes actually been pretty open about it. But honestly I just dont really care. In a lot of ways things only mean what they do because people agree on it by refusing to give sex any greater meaning I remove so many arbitrary social rules and expectations from my life. In my mind thats a good thing  cutting away complexity with Occams Razor is surprisingly cathartic. Puppys shedding schedule has been a bit weird. While I was trying to switch her to rats she wasnt eating enough to grow much. When we first started talking Id just been able to get her eating again and she shed for the first time in a couple months. Since then shes been eating pretty well and so she grew a decent amount pretty quickly. Snakes shed pretty fast maybe once every month or two when they are young and it slows down as they age. Leche or should I call her Starlady? is going to look downright fabulous when she sheds!Honestly what Id say is check out Adobes Creative Cloud Photography plan. Its mo and gives you Lightroom and Photoshop. With those two you should be able to edit existing photos very effectively. And once you have cleared your backlog you can suspend your membership for a while. Honestly Ive never really been much of a car person. Its kind of a pity  Id like to be a car person but Ive never had an opportunity to learn. Those are some great photos! I really like them. So my best friend is an ENTP too. Hes just like you  doesnt want kids at all. Im kinda curious about whether being antikid is a common thread among us xNTP types. Yeah I totally get what you mean. You already know and understand the meaning even if you havent put it into words. A surprising number of people have told me that they have to think in words  they cant think of concepts if they dont know the words. Other people have told me that they think visually  when thinking of a tree for example they actually have to picture a tree. I think that staying in an unhealthy situation even if you have good intentions can often end up being worse for everyone involved. Before you can heal you need to stop further damage from happening. I think that staying together for the kids falls into that category. If I were growing up and understood that my parents were continuing to be miserable for my sake itd certainly make me feel shitty about it. But like you my opinion doesnt count for much heh. Let me know when youre getting started with coding  I know enough to help you out with any of the stuff youre likely to encounter while learning. Typically what people actually do is have two servers  a development server and a live server. They tell google to ignore the dev server making it more or less private and perfect it there. Then after everything is all set up they launch the site on the live server. I saw an AMA on rscience a while back that talked about this exact thing. I saved it and will be rereading it when Im starting to get my shit together to start on that path. Definitely add some fake plants! A splash of green would look great in there. edit oh my fucking god. I dont know how familiar you are with american politics but this is a fucking disaster. ,reptiles,d9rs7mw,1,t5_2qy22

Some reptiles especially the larger ones Ive seen such as monitors and tortoises seem to enjoy being pethandledetc. Theres no use in keeping a three foot tortoise in his enclosure constantly and not letting him roam a bit the same for a monitor.

10232943,0,t3_5mggxd,One common myth is that they require no heating and thrive at room temperatures. Unless you live on the equator this most likely is completely false. They need a hot area of  F max with a year round heated area between  year round. They can do just fine without this but growth will be stunted and all around they will be less healthy. I use and recommend an UTHunder tank heater attached to the side of the cage. You always need a thermostat and I set mine all to  F. I like to position a hide up against the side of the cage where the heater is so that they can find warmth while sleeping and easily thermoregulate.,reptiles,dc3ymjj,1,t5_2qy22

10629271,0,t1_ddbd0zx,I think tegus being larger and stockier than monitors require bigger minimum cage size. Although they better tolerate extended roaming so should be good ,reptiles,ddcbu4v,1,t5_2qy22

11068799,0,t3_5y1yge,I would be careful with supplements as that could lead to further issues. I would give her ample space to exercise yard big enclosure etc and make sure her diet is varied. Stay away from too many fruits and avoid things that have large amounts of proteins. The common issue is everyone wants them to grow fast and that causes many of their shell deformities. Keep in mind these animals are grazers and arent used to having a huge salad supplied to them every day. Our larger ones live in our backyard with their own shed of course and only get fed about once a week. The remainder of the time they are grazing the grass and weeds that we have planted for them.,reptiles,demmz5u,1,t5_2qy22

The heater is on all the time and the secondary light its a  socket fixture with separate power and switches for each side is on a timer so its on about  hours each day. Since theyre ambush predators they burrow into the substrate and dont really move. I replace his sub every month and he just picks a new spot to dig into until the next time I clean.
