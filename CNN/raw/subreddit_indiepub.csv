1909437,0,t3_2gfvcj,I learned to not expect anything good just randomly happen to me because I think it should. I lie tho. Im still learning that. I dont know maybe that is the same as ratalaika mentioned  becoming more realistic. So far I expected all of my releases to have at least a bit of success and so far none of them did have any despite being well rated and accepted by players. Something is still missing. Despite that I got a little bit more confident in what I do. I know I can make a game in a week. Thats cool. It might even be a fun game. I just shouldnt expect that anyone will genuinely want to play it.And gamedev got me through some personal stuff this year. Having your mind full of virtual stuff and at the same time doing something productive is a great therapy. Could be that Im currently am more positive person than I wouldve been otherwise. Now if only I could have a bit better results in this area thatd be great ,indiepub,ckj9wpq,3,t5_33k2q
1921919,0,t1_ckko7m4,Paypal has issues Im still using it to small purchases since my options are limited because of my small European country. I like itch.io tho. Especially because of its clean and tidy design. If I ever sell a game  going to do it there before trying my luck on Steam which might never happen.That being said I need to upload all of my games there... Maybe someone will enjoy them and buy me a cup of coffee. Thatd be nice.,indiepub,ckks018,1,t5_33k2q
2079035,0,t3_2i4ke2,Hopefully By October th really means Through October th!
