3270976,0,t1_cp12dob,Read the passage you quoted again. Youre confusing touchbased full screen  design requirements with the technical requirements of putting software on the different processor that RT has.Listen RT is built on top of Win. It carries ALL the same structure and libraries but runs on a different processor. The question here isnt how to make a touch screen Firefox app for windows store its can Firefox be ported or recompiled for ARM directly as a desktop application,windowsapps,cp14903,1,t5_2tnly

Also tried it on a completely different machine.I had the issue with Apex until like you mentioned I installed it on my boot drive . . . but that doesnt seem to be the issue here.,windowsapps,d7xl2jf,1,t5_2tnly
