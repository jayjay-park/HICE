11209117,0,t1_df2i0z4,Actually that one might just be a difference in how the octaves are named between old and new versions of Synthesia.  That first screenshot looks like it came from a YouTube video of a much older version of Synthesia vs. the second which is from a newer version.This is an interesting fact but after all these centuries there is still some disagreement on where to start counting octaves.  Synthesia recently switched to the more correct depending who you ask! scientific pitch notationSo what youre seeing between those two screenshots is probably just a simple naming difference.  The notes and pitches are exactly the same.,synthesia,df2jh4o,2,t5_2tpg1
