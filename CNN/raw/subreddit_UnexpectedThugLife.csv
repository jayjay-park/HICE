2746999,0,t3_2r7oan,From NRK Norwegian BBC  Sunday evening the entertainment website The LAD Bible shared the clip on Facebook. In writing over six million people watched the video which is based on a  year old reportage mixed with music from gangsta rappers Geto Boys.  Its pretty amazing that six million more than the Norwegian population has looked at an old case where they have twisted the story and added effects says Odd Karsten Tveit today. Went to West BankThe ideo material is obtained from Dagsrevyens The News on NRK Norways equivalent to the BBC coverage of the first intifada in . Tveit was in the town Ramallah on the West Bank to see if the rebellion had spread there.  I traveled with an experienced Israeli photographer who had long worked for large companies. It seemed quiet apart from some stone throwing says the reporter. Then came an Israeli jeep but there was no shooting. The photographer then wanted to make something called a standup into the camera where the reporter reports on the situation. Ended in the firing line  I stood up and told that it was quiet here. It was admittedly the thousandth day of the intifada and it could erupt clashes anytime says Odd Karsten Tveit.  As I said this the soldiers jumped out of the jeep and one runs up and shoots.  And you continue to work ...?  I was aware that he would not shoot at me. I did not wear a field uniform but a shirt that clearly signaled that I was a reporter says the experienced war reporter. Tveit then completes what he should say  seemingly untouched by the shot that was fired.  The photographer said afterwards that he had never experienced such a perfect standup. It was once in a lifetime!  Today it is different The experienced war reporter says he was not afraid even though he was right in the firing line.  I knew I was not the target. Many people have asked if it was all arranged. It was of course not.  In the comments to the video many are surprised that you neither had a bulletproof vest or a helmet?  At the time we did not use it. We felt safe because we were journalists. Later journalists a goal in itself for Israeli soldiers including during the second intifada in the s. Then we had to use protection said Tveit. He adds  But you must still act on sensible manner. For a dead reporter is no good reporter.Not a GANGSTA  I dont understand the point in calling me a thug or gangsta but it is probably some expression that the young people use today? asks Odd Karsten Tveit. ,UnexpectedThugLife,cngbm4q,2,t5_33uma

Its like saying Tiger Woods would put David Beckham to shame on the field theres no way to know that but each would probably win in their respective sports. Floyd Mayweather uses the rules of boxing to win by technicality. If you dont think he hugs to win you must not have seen him fight. Ronda would lose a boxing match to him for that very reason. Ronda scraps and wins by submission though. There are no rules in a street fight therefore Floyd is immediately at a disadvantage because his technique is useless whereas scrapping and breaking peoples arms is fully allowed in a street fight giving Ronda the advantage. Gender has nothing to do with it Floyd isnt the same kind of fighter Ronda is and Ronda doesnt spend  minutes hugging her opponent to gain marginal technical leads with the judges.,UnexpectedThugLife,ct4xums,1,t5_33uma

4927423,0,t1_cufmsmj,gt I really dont see your point in this context sorry are you afraid that the US government will seize private property to reach the goal of socialised health care? Thatd be laughable.My point is simply that the end doesnt always justify the means. gtWhat they could do is to just use the tax money betterGood luck with that. Health care is one of MANY ways in which the us government uses taxpayer money poorly. Part of why people dont like the idea of universal healthcare is that the US government SUCKS when it comes to using tax money efficiently. gtWouldnt you want that health care for everyone without having to pay more for it?I would love that.

4928023,0,t1_cufka5w,gt Seems to me that is the government forcing people to do things. Really thats all a government does force the people to do things.Some people forget that when a. some segment of the populace consistently acts to the socioeconomic detriment of the majority and b. no other entity can thats kinda their fucking job. Some people would want the government to step in if their neighbor stole or devalued their property. Others want the government to step in when unhealthy people spend the lions share of all peoples insurance premiums leaving the system and mostly healthy people at a financial disadvantage when they do get sick. Both of those things sound like valid concerns that might best be resolved by a legally neutral yet authoritative entity to me. Our Constitution guarantees the right to redress when someone else stealsdevalues our property or inhibits the access to a product or service some of us have already been paying for.

5185913,0,t1_cvb25eu,Now its gonna sound like Im a liar because I just said close calls dont happen that often and now I have to say I had  close calls today.Ive heard a lot of bikers take a us vs. them view on things and act like its every single day that cagers nearly kill them. I think that this is a very unhealthy viewpoint to take and also that theyre either exaggerating or they arent riding defensivelypredictively. This weekend I rode  miles round trip to a company retreat. I had one close call and that was my fault. I misjudged the speed of an oncoming car when I went for a pass and I completed the pass with only about  feet to spare at mph thats close. On average I see about one close call every week or two. But I predict and preemptively avoid several per day.I watch for things like cars that arent holding their lane position reliably cars that are changing lanes frequently unpredictably or without signalling and cars that appear to be poorly maintained especially their tires. I avoid these cars as best I can whether that be giving a generous follow distance when Im on surface streets or throttling past them on the highway.I also look for cars that have a bunch of dents in one spot on their car. If theyve got dents in their rear quarter panel they probably dont check their blind spot. Destroyed rear bumper? Either stops suddenly or reverses without checking. Then I try to stay out of their danger zone.I try to apply this alertness and predictivedefensive driving when Im in my truck but if Im honest with myself I get very lazy in my truck. Driving feels very numb and uninvolved and I often find myself almost zoning out. Its scary when you get to your destination with no distinct memories of what occurred between A and B. That means you were on autopilot and didnt have your evasive systems online.Edit almost forgot theres two kinds of rider. Those who have gone down and those who are going down. Im currently in the latter group and hopefully Ill stay there. Only dropped my bike a couple times in a parking lot. ,UnexpectedThugLife,cvb3d0l,5,t5_33uma

5262359,0,t1_cvkaxrl,I dont care if this was worst than usual... After seeing that this was worst enough for me to say f them. Yesterday i started seeing the whole interview it was already annoying when they kept interrupting Bill for high school puns but OK not all comedy has to be Colbert level and they might be trying to appeal that audience.Then when the moron that only has that job because space technology exists started saying he didnt care about science news and started babbling about who knows what and they all went on a circlejerk of bad puns and ignorance is cool attitude for a moment i thought i was watching a MTV show... It was really bad rcringe bad. I couldnt watch till the end bad.For me this show should burn to the ground.,UnexpectedThugLife,cvkbp0y,19,t5_33uma

5582522,0,t1_cwp1g1e,No theyre claiming seeing as historically the cabinet has not been chosen based on merit surely we can find  women who are more qualified for these positions than the people who held them in the past. I think it says something that Trudeau was able to have his  female cabinet and still appoint a much more qualified cabinet than any one of Harpers. And before you jump down my throat I sometimes post on rtia and I really dislike the superinsane SJW movement. This cabinet thing is getting blown way out of proportion though. ,UnexpectedThugLife,cwp2aya,10,t5_33uma
