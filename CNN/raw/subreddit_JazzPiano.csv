I usually end up playing four keys a day which ends up playing through all twelve twice a week with an extra day. Ive been working through a Brubeck transcription lately too I cheated and used some one elses. which us technically demamding so Ill play that to get my fingers moving. ,JazzPiano,cs5pd99,1,t5_2tttq
