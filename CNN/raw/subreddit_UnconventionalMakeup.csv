7145853,0,t3_4dezx7,LOVE that lip! When i saw it was nyx i was like i need to buy that..then i read the rest and noped. But that color..I considered buying UD electric myself but when i swatched Thrash was the only one i really wanted. Dupe anyone?CC  id like to see the brows be not quite so dark. Or possibly fully or partially colored maybe a bit of purple or blue to tie everything together. My personal opinion only plus i like colored brows ,UnconventionalMakeup,d1qepso,2,t5_3dsus

8739540,0,t3_4zpjsb,I really like the concept and dont knock your execution the choppyness of it came out really well and the colours look good together and against your skin. The thoughts I did have CC wise are maybe to try a slight shadowing on each shape to make the bit of cut tea leaf stand out more. And I wondered if the choppy shape nature would go well with each eye having a different arrangement so its not so symmetrical I like how the bottom green shape ends further inwards on one side than the other. ,UnconventionalMakeup,d6y3crl,3,t5_3dsus

8970283,0,t3_5337qo,This is a really fun look!If youre looking for any constructive criticism I would definitely recommend moving the mouth of the pumpkin to a different location. Your nose kind of ruins the illusion. Also a pumpkin with a tongue amp teeth but no eyeballs doesnt really make sense. The tongue definitely makes it really cute so maybe adding in some adorable cartoon eyeballs will sell the look.Happy early Halloween!,UnconventionalMakeup,d7q3bin,11,t5_3dsus

11685375,0,t1_dgket76,Thank you! I actually used dollar store white face paint and then once that was dried used ELF black purple and grey shadows from one of their large pallets with a blush brush mixing them together and tappingstippling the color on. The green is dollar store hair coloring gel that I applied directly on with my middle finger tapping and layering the texture up. Ive never explained my process before ha. I hope that made sense! Edit I forgot my lips! I used NYX Liquid Suede in Stone Fox and then using the same brush and technique as my face mixed the purple and black and tapped that over and around my lips too. ,UnconventionalMakeup,dgkjza4,1,t5_3dsus
