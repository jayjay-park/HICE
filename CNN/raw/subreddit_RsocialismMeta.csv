445568,0,t1_cfqy23b,Yeah revolutionaries never killed anybody. Its not like a certain Bolshevik whose name starts with a letter T massacred anarchists followed by fighting a democratic government. But then again you have a liberal understanding of democracy. Im sure yo you democracy is letting ruling class pedos rule everything.Please stop responding to me with incoherent and anti Marxist pseudo Stalinist comments. I cant read whatever form of English you are trying to write in. And stop raping kids its disgusting. And it is definitely not democratic.,RsocialismMeta,cfqy5bf,-10,t5_30d3f

606476,0,t1_cg8myw4,gtIf you want to talk about how we can move forward in terms of how we try to democratize rsocialism then that may be more useful.I agree but Im out of ideas. I think this would help draw up more support for our cause. It seems like the logical next step.,RsocialismMeta,cg97js9,3,t5_30d3f
624358,0,t1_cg99fqm,Thanks for your input browndirtwandering but I think it would be more helpful if we summarize the gist of our struggle here at rRsocialismmeta for anyone that is not familiar with the crooked ways of the mods.,RsocialismMeta,cgb8nv3,1,t5_30d3f

1248389,0,t1_cia1e0i,Its not whether or not he was guilty but the dismissal of the testimony of Dylan farrow and the framing of the issue as a political attack on Allen. I cant point to where they dismissed Dylan because thats the point they didnt address her concerns when that was the whole point of the article they responded to. Quit trying to make this into something its not. ,RsocialismMeta,cia25ca,1,t5_30d3f
2026123,0,t1_ckxd28b,Right...But youve been trolling at rsocialism for what  years with dozens of comments every day. Unless you have some ulterior political purpose I really dont understand what motivates you.,RsocialismMeta,ckxd2zw,2,t5_30d3f
2047868,0,t1_cl02or4,gtIts about a thousand times more likely hisher BF spends his day checking IDs and manning drunk checkpoints on base.That doesnt change the fact the function of the RMP is to operate as an internal police force in the military enforcing the discipline of command. Does it really take much imagination to recognize that this is an arm of the state that will play a critical repressive role in the event of any major social upheaval within Britain and that the comments in the link about discussing the security of leftist parties with a representative of such an organization are lightminded and unserious?,RsocialismMeta,cl04nno,6,t5_30d3f

2609822,0,t1_cmz1ojb,Yes the SEP has deep and irreconcilable differences with these organizations. However this in no way interferes with the principled defense of these organizations against attacks from the ruling class especially when individuals online or otherwise call for their murder. For example most recently the SEP has defended the Australian Socialist AlternativeOppose the witchhunt against Socialist AlternativePolitical witchhunt against Socialist Alternative on Australian campusesEdit In a previous comment ubjornironside noted from yet another one of their sockpuppets that they were associated with the PSL. This comment was deleted because this individual has been banned for promoting the murder of socialists. There is no need to slander the PSL by associating them with such sociopaths. The critique of the PSL should be made on the basis of their political perspective and program. ,RsocialismMeta,cmz8p69,1,t5_30d3f

4918276,0,t1_cudls30,I would avoid getting your information about the WSWS from rsocialism. And when they do make their outrageous claims ask for a linkeither they will refuse to provide one they will inevitably distort the content of the WSWS article if they actually link to it or they will provide links to the Spartacist tendency or blogs posted by individuals completely obsessed with David North to the point that they write strange Haikou poems about him.The World Socialist Web Site wsws.org is the publication of the International Committee of the Fourth International. The Socialist Equality Parties make up the different national sections of the ICFI. The group traces its heritage to the struggle for genuine Marxism led by Trotsky and the Left Opposition against the Stalinist degeneration of Soviet Bureaucracy ultimately forming the Fourth International in . The International Committee was formed in  by James P. Cannon the leader of the Socialist Workers Party the Trotskyist movement in the US in opposition to the attempts to liquidate the Fourth International by Michel Pablothat is turn the Fourth International into pressure groups on Social Democracy and the Communist Party instead of fighting for the political independence and class interests of the international working class. As the SWP gave into Pabloism the defenders of the IC in the United States formed the Workers League which in  became the Socialist Equality Party.If you are interested I would encourage you to read the WSWS and look at their major statements and documents The WSWS Chronology provides an overview of the WSWSs news coverage and analysis over the past  yearsWSWS ChronologyFifteen Years of the World Socialist Website The Socialist Equality Partys US ProgramThe Breakdown of Capitalism and the Fight for Socialism in the United States Program of the Socialist Equality PartyStatement of PrinciplesUnited States   The Historical and International Foundations of the Socialist Equality PartyUnited States Australia Britain Germany Sri Lanka PakistanYou might also take a look at some of the lectures on world economy socialism in the twentieth century imperialism and other topics Equality the Rights of Man and the Birth of Socialism Reform and Revolution in the Epoch of Imperialism Marxism and Revisionism on the eve of the twentieth century The origins of Bolshevism and What Is To Be Done?
