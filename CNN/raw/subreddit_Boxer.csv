134970,0,t3_1vlhzn,It is quite a bit more than putting her paw on our feet. She will rake her paws across us wherever they happen to reach and not lightly at all. It is painful not playful. It just seems as if she will get in the mood to be in charge and will not accept no for an answer. The barks in this situation are loud and piercing and often come with no warning. If she is close to our ears at the time it is extremely startling and unpleasant. Her timeouts in the kennel sometimes work for brief periods but sometimes not. We are hoping someone has a helpful suggestion. ,Boxer,cetswte,1,t5_2qvqn

180461,0,t3_1vvtwm,Im not sure how effective this will be for a male boxer but one of my female boxers is very dominant in certain behaviors. When she acts in such a way I put her on her back. First I grab her and push her to her side. Next I pull her onto her back. Finally I give her a really stern look and then make her go to her time out spot  standing over her for at least a couple of minutes. This has greatly improved her actions.

6561832,0,t3_45gruf,I have a  year old boxer and she has a lot of skin problems. One of the things we see and to be honest arent very concerned about are these very tiny clumps of fur maybe the size of the flat end of a needle that you can simply pull off of her. It doesnt hurt her at all to pull them off and its not often she gets them.When we adopted her at two she would break out in hives constantly and we were feeding her the same food her previous owners had fed her up to that point. We switched brands after a month or two of constant breakouts and what a difference a better brand made. What I would suggest  and remember I have no training  would be to get her on a diet of good food. Through the years weve tried a few brands each with several years of success. After that however they all seems to give her digestive issues and we go ahead and try something new. Currently we use Fromm and she seems to be happy with that and doesnt seem to have nearly as many bad stomach days as she used to.Im sure this didnt answer your question but I wanted to let you know we do see something similar. Good luck!,Boxer,czy1qmj,3,t5_2qvqn

8712571,0,t3_4zcbqh,In terms of pulling bring tiny treats and use a simple command or whistle when he gets too far ahead of you.  When training mine to not pull I would give a short whistle when she got too far ahead and pull on her leash.  Eventually just whistling let her know that she was too far ahead.  Then once she started to realize where I wanted her during our walks I would give her treats when she stayed at my side for stretches.  As far as jumping he has to know what down means.  It starts with getting him not to jump on you.  When he jumps on you say down and turn your body.  Once he realizes that he isnt supposed to jump on you and he associates a command like down with not jumping you can use it with him around children and others.  Also approach kids with him on a leash for a while so you have more control until he gets it down.,Boxer,d6upi3v,1,t5_2qvqn

He got them from the dog park apparently young dogs are more susceptible to catching this virus because their immune systems are weak. He got about four or five on his mouth and one in his ear. They all shriveled up and fell off in  months. They are really gross looking like cauliflower! Regardless agreed that it warrants a trip to the vet good luck!
