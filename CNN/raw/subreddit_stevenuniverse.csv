311347,0,t1_cfcgfbh,I think that would be a great theme for an episode. Just Steven at home with the Gems out on a mission and no monsters to fight himself. Just a straight forward story driven episode. It would be a great way to give both him and Connie some good character development and show Steven a bit outside his element so to speak.I have to say I loved Connie the little bit that we got to see of her. A lot of the Gems seem pretty onedimensional at the moment its still early though but Connie really broke the mold. Most of the characters being outgoing in their own way her initial borderline shyness was refreshing. Not to mention that she has been in my opinion the most expressive character in the series.As for whether or not Steven and she should get together? Well I think I will leave that one up to better writers than I. I would be happy either way. I think putting them together in the first season would be moving rather fast with the rapidly growing fanbase I dont doubt a second season but again Ill leave the story writing to the peeps whore doing the writing.,stevenuniverse,cfd1fqd,2,t5_2viyl

But from what we saw in Too many birthdays shes the most emotionally resilient Gem in the team. Pearl was a nervous wreck and Garnet looked like she was sliding into catatonia and Ames was the only one who had some semblance of functionality even if she was clearly in denial about the whole situation.Oddly I cannot imagine things being very different from that after Roses departure. From what we have seen Pearl would have been absolutely shattered.  Garnet would have been unable to cope too in a state of permanent daze and burying herself in work as a coping mechanism. Ames would have been in denial but shes the only one that I can picture trying to nudge the others back into emotional health trying to put the pieces back together and move on.,stevenuniverse,ckr6gq5,4,t5_2viyl

She doesnt know how acceptingunaccepting they are at least in relationship to alien beings.

2790856,0,t3_2s0eyt,Ive seen a lot of different theories float around the subreddit on the issue and my favorite comes from the early season  days boy how much has changed since then.The jist of it is that the gems were tasked with conqueringdestroying earth in some way shape or form. Now we know that the Gems have been on Earth for a very very VERY long time so obviously this isnt something recent but it would be safe to say in the confines of this theory that Rose has played a major part in the issues between the Crystal Gems and the HomeworldOther GemsEtc.We know from the Mural that there was some sort of schism and there was a fight between Rose and some other gem. The very least we can draw from this is that Rose was the figurehead of some sort of split and there was a fight. What was the fight over? Who knows.The area that the gems teleport to that has this mural is obviously on earth as the gems cant teleport off earth. This means the fight took place on earth and this is possibly why we have so many roguesick gems rampaging around and attempting to hurt the gemshumanitygem sites.We know these corrupted gems are formerly regular crystal gem warriors so we can make the guess that they were on one of the sides of this battle which is why they are on earth and could possibly be how they got their gems broken. Obviously they arent all bad in the example of Lapis she simply wanted to go home and Steven gave her that ability. She didnt hurt him afterwards and it seems like she didnt really want to fight anyone to begin with she was just very angry and very upset. Though MirrorOcean gem raised a few questions about the AmathystPearlGarnet and their treatment of these other gems. Steven partially out of naivete and partially from being a kind person listened to the mirror set Lapis free and almost brought upon the end of the world Sorta kinda whatever. In the end it was Steven who saved the day not by fighting but by talking which seems to be a common trait that Steven shares with his mother.What this all boils down to is that Rose most likely instigated a massive conflict between the Gems and we can take a guess at it being based around humanity or generally the life on Earth that she has been stated as loving time and time again. Rose being a sort of odd gem out in that her skill set seems to be very defensive rather than offensive even the laser light cannon can be seen as a defensive weapon rather than a purely offensive weapon and this probably didnt mesh well with some other gems which could have instigated the war even further.When the smoke settled and many gem lives were lost you could image that Rose would have severed the ties with the home world stopping any more opposing gems from coming through and spent the rest of her time trying to clean up the mess. This would explain where the ritual of bubbling gems comes from as we now know that Rose had the power to bubble and she was trying to heal gems. My guess would be that the corrupted gems are combatants from both sides and Rose simply doesnt discriminate. When Rose gave up her physical form the gems simply continued on stopping and bubbling the ruined gems.I got really off topic.,stevenuniverse,cnlb6gt,12,t5_2viyl

UG crazy but somehow always right Pizza Steve over confident dick Uncle gus big strong quiet guy. all of the main characters have no depth to them whatsoever compare this now to johnny test where the characters are slightly less flat with personalities that are defined but not set in stone. the biggest one up that JT has over  UG is the relationship between johnny and suzy that continually changes over the course of the show with the changes being consistent episode by episode. neither of these shows match the intelligence or fun that steven universe does but johnny test would be a stack of shit while uncle grandpa is juicy diarrhea spread across the floor. neither wanted but the stack is easiest to deal with.  ,stevenuniverse,coqyb6w,20,t5_2viyl

So it could happen all in a moment but itd be real hard to say it was instant and simultaneous Because Steven has to process them linearly.its a lot like a videogame you can play the level until you know the routine down cold and find the best route and enemy locations. if you game over you can just reset getting better over time knowing where you screwed up.Its the just a matter of settling on that final good run.,stevenuniverse,corexd8,2,t5_2viyl

3213026,0,t1_couxhoo,There may be no other alien races nearby in this series there may be  tons. Physics in the series may be different so traveling in warp space may be incredibly different that warp drives. Maybe wormholes dont exist or cant be used in their universe. Warp space is pretty interesting though. Is it a full dimension or just a liminal space?  I think Rebecca Sugar hasnt put lots of science fiction in because the show is heavily influenced on magic ss anime and vidya games. If anything itd be more likely that RS and the Crewniverse are basing the Gems tech and space stuff on anime like Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop and not so much on Star Trek or Star Wars. Gem mecha would be pretty darn cool. Fusions are almost living mechasuits. Anyway though Id say its less of a show about intergalactic space warriors and more about a trio of magical girls raising a young boy. I suppose if you want to dream up some other alien species to live and interact with gems though thats pretty cool.   My crack theory has always been that the Gems are the product of an ancient race of organic aliens who created and used the Gems as living tools. Ether ancient Gems ruled up against their creators or their creators died out some other way. The Gems with no way to grow their empire or reproduce invented a way to create sentient Gems from raw crystals and thats where we are. ,stevenuniverse,cov14ju,1,t5_2viyl

3256070,0,t3_2x7kqb,I had the same idea about this show. I honestly thought that was not worth my time. When I first saw the trailer I was turned off but when I watched Gem Glow. I had the biggest smile on my face when it ended. I fell in love with Steven Universe and Steven himself. Hes so caring and kind and compassionate for a kid his age. One of my favorite heartbreaking episodes would have to be The Test. or the end of it when spoilers Steven finds out that they rigged it and he heard their conversation about not know what to do about him and the fact that he was a gem hybrid. Instead of confronting them about their deceit he comforted them and acknowledged the fact that they were trying to help him and they were feeling their way through this too. It was really sweet and heartbreaking. I hope I can have a kid like Steven one day.,stevenuniverse,cozi3of,2,t5_2viyl

Its possible that Im seeing it through nerdcolored glasses they are taupe for the record but I quite enjoy the show.The episodes I consider to be the best are and be prepared this is a hefty list also I have bolded the best ones The Gauntlet It Came From the Depths although previously spoken Mikey dialogue gets really awkward at one point still the rest of the episode is good I Monster TCRI Baxters Gambit Operation Break Out Showdown season  finale Slash and Destroy Ive bolded this one because I enjoy violence Fungus Humungous Of Rats and Men The Manhattan Project bolded only because this one is important  Newtralized they turned Danny Trejo into a newt! He did not get better. The Wrath of Tiger Claw The Legend of the Kuro Kabuto not great in its own right but I have my reasons Vengeance is Mine The Invasion THIS. ABSOLUTELY THIS. Within the Woods In Dreams This is a ridiculous episode. I LOVE IT. Vision Quest Return to New York Serpent Hunt again not great in its own right but I have my reasons The Pig and the Rhino REEEEEEEEASOOOOOOONS and The Battle for New York.But if you REALLY want to see how good this show can be without spoiling too much prior plot for you check out The Gauntlet. One of the first really good episodes of the series. Or if you want the full plot details start from the first two episodes and see how you feel from there.Should be noted by the way I did NOT grow up with TMNT growing up. I kind of stumbled upon this show and ended up loving it.

3392959,0,t1_cpevi1r,Me I was just personally rather surprised by Ruby and Sapphire.  For the most part Steven Universe has avoided the most obvious gemstones for its characters like Diamond Ruby Sapphire and Emerald and instead has gone for less valuable or more obscure gems like Jasper and Malachite and Sugilite and Watermelon Tourmaline.    Seriously every time you see gemstones mentioned on a cartoon or a videogame those will be the four gems mentioned diamond ruby sapphire emerald from the cups on F Zero Gx to the Crystal Stars on Paper Mario to of course Gen  of Pokemon.   At this point I honestly would not be surprised if the pokemon games were one of the reasons these names were chosen for the characters.  Not the main reason but a little homage. Even when they used Diamond they diferentiated it from the many many characters with the name by adding a Yellow to the beginning of it.  Very few people picture a yellow diamond when the word is said to them we picture clear or white stones or less commonly pink or blue ones.   Yellow?  Nooo.I was expecting Garnets gem components to be something like Citrine and Topaz or Agate and Fluorine.   I expect after this any more Gems we see will avoid the most obvious gemstone names like Emerald and have more obscure names like Calaverite or Morganite. ,stevenuniverse,cpf0vm8,4,t5_2viyl

3421248,0,t3_2zeng4,Im okay with people being like hey I like this and this but a lot of them and maybe not even a lot just a vocal minority are trying to literally turn it into horses .. And thats not okay. SU is a sparkling gem of unique but not in the way horses was. Horses was a toyettic grab for money that chan started to ironically like followed by people myself included genuinely enjoying the show. Horses was unique in that the people watching it did break the gender stereotypes for both men and women.However then the horses fandom got to the creepy point you know the point. Where neckbeards are spending  dollars on a dyed blue fedora with a rainbow belt and foam wings where the whole neckbeard tipping thing began to fester. Sure the show was still good but it was hard to say the show was enjoyable because of the people who became the vocal majority.When I was into horses back when it was sort of my way of mitigating some emotional issues I was having the fandom was still young and fresh. We had new music by the bucket fulls when a musician left to pursue a career in music we all said good luck. None of this PINO bullshit nor this sort of spiteful vitriol.  Hell I made friends with a lot of the musicians mostly for professional reasons and they were all super rad dudes. And normally I try to talk shop with horse cosplayers at conventions because they have some pretty rad costumes. Now and days in horse land those sort of people are rare. Now its mostly the entitled tipping neckberidum shaviosa who displays the horse fandom. Because thats how the fandom started to act. They lashed out because horses now made them unique. Hell weve all heard what happened at Unicon and Bronycon weve heard those stories. The first Bronycon was literally magical because it was still tight knit and everybody was kind. Its what happened to the horse fandom thats really freaking people out. Where google searching my little pony shows up porn suggestions. And there is porn of everything but not nearly so numerous. Its not the older bronies joining in its the wrathful angry ones. I know I just sound like a bitter elder brony I cant believe those words were typed but it sounds like a funny term to meTLDR People are upset because theyre trying to turn it into horse .. And weve seen what happened to horse .. Especially because this is not a show where its like OH WOW MEN WATCHING STEVEN UNIVERSE given how all inclusive the show is,stevenuniverse,cpi8wuz,9,t5_2viyl

Its not made for everyone. For the history of the MLP fandom I kinda saw the criticism as disproportionate and unfair on our part. I often see that people would criticize every move that one of us makes and then curse at the fandom because they saw something they didnt like. ,stevenuniverse,cpia84z,1,t5_2viyl

So were trying to find other fun things for him to do instead of Roblox and Youtube videos.  I realized that he never watches any regular television shows. Why not show him SU?Before showing him anything I gave him a quick back story of the show and gems how Steven came to be etc. The first episode I ever saw was Giant Woman so I decided that would be the one. Sadies face right here was his face the entire time and when Steven started singing Giant woman he made the loudest GRRROOAAAN sound and tried to walk out but I made him stay. By the end of the episode he actually admitted that it wasnt terrible and now he will actually watch it with us when my kids and I are over. Im not sure if he watches it on his own though.

3559559,0,t1_cpxqz43,Good points about Lapis. I dont think the song is meant to be just about her though shes an important character but not so important that the ending theme of every episode would be about just her. I would think the song applies to her and Stevens friendship but its links specifically to her are more about her role as kicking off the first big myth arc twoparter and first hint that the Crystal Gems have had to make morally grey choices. Rose loved people but weve seen especially in Roses Scabbard that she kept so many secrets from everyone. But the show has hinted in Political Power and Full Disclosure that Steven is going to be turning away from that attitude I think the narrative is critical of that particular choice Rose made and may continue to show its negative consequences. With that and the shows general theme of the beauty in imperfection Id be surprised at this point if we didnt have at least a small reveal about Rose having flaws or doubts. So yeah I like the idea that the song might be about Rose because her having doubts about whether she can be the leader the Crystal Gems saw in her and wondering if shes loving in the right way I mean you can do things without knowing if youre doing them correctly seems interesting to me. ,stevenuniverse,cpy0jm0,2,t5_2viyl

3591193,0,t1_cq1lgpe,The problem with Pearl is that her default reaction to pretty much anything that takes her out of her little box of order is blushing so its kind of hard to read her moods. I think this is one of the reasons people ship her with everybody.    Pearl is probably the gem thats most openly clingy to the people she cares about. Shes always quick to hold Steven or grab onto Garnets arm. She definitely needs the people around her and also feels the need to be needed as well.    Amethysts feelings towards Rose were like that of a daughter and we havent really had anything from Garnet that tells us what their relationship was like beyond leader and follower. Pearl clearly feels a very different kind of attachment to Rose than Amethyst did and seems to think that their relationship was more special than anybody elses. The fact that Pearl was something of a confidant to Rose certainly implies it was there but for all we know that couldve been a deliberate move of Roses for Pearls benefit because Pearl needs to feel special and important for the sake of her emotional and mental wellbeing. It couldve also have been a legit tactical move and Pearl had some quality during wartime that made her suited to know about things like Roses secret armory.    Did Rose and Pearl have a romantic relationship? Honestly its hard to say. We dont have enough context and what we do have can be read in a multitude of ways. I personally think at the very least there was a onesided romantic feeling on Pearls part but its hard to distinguish from Pearls general intimacy and clinginess with the other Crystal Gems.    Pearls outright disdain for Greg is another grey area. It certainly COULD be because he stole her love but it could also be because of her general condescending attitude towards humanity. Amethyst and Greg do ultimately get along and Garnet tolerates and even eventually comes to appreciate Greg but Pearl clearly does not like the man and does not appreciate having him as a part of her life but puts up with it for Stevens sake. Pearl is also the only one to really show any kind of resentment towards Steven for Rose being gone as opposed to Amethyst who seems to lay the blame for that entirely on Greg and doesnt ever show any negativity towards Steven. I dont think its fair to say that she misses Rose the most but she certainly takes her absence much harder than Garnet and Amethyst do.    Ultimately its impossible to tell. For all of her refinement and supposed perfection Pearl wears her heart on her sleeve but its really hard to distinguish her individual emotions. Everything kind of blends together into one big mass of egocentric insecurity.,stevenuniverse,cq1mgi4,6,t5_2viyl

3603465,0,t3_31mek1,Towards the end I was tooling around trying to find one last red crystal so Amethyst became my goto attacker with a plus luckminus defense badge. Especially for larger groups she was routinely pulling in multiple extra stars so I could oneround most battles. For progression I usually stuck her with the heal every round badge and the stars on blocked hits badge and just let her sit there and watch the fights shes pretty worthless against anything but clearing out weakened enemies.Pearl was usually my initial attack for larger enemies with either a spear toss or fireball barrage meaning shed immediately get clobbered by all so that revival badge helped out a ton for that. Sorry birdmom you became my sacrificial punching bag. When she wasnt acting as a tank she was on crowd control by keeping enemies stunlocked.Garnet usually does her own thing by either launching her fists or doing her  hit punch attack if I had enough stars. Boosting her luck meant she was getting healed every time she attacked usually leading to a full heal with the  hit.But seriously how are you functioning with almost no defense? ,stevenuniverse,cq30ra0,3,t5_2viyl

3632380,0,t1_cq67av0,Well to be fair Garnets appearance here is heavily based on ganguro which while a little offensive seeming if you dont know the origin of it is actually a Japanese practice of basically darkening the skin. Now this has a lot of cultural background and when I say a lot I mean a lot. Some of it comes from direct rebellion to the Japanese standards of beauty pale skin and dark hair but it also has roots in Japanese folklore and even a decidedly Japanese appreciation of African American style and aesthetics that were learned and loved more or less through cinema without any actual cultural context. More over it has become an anime trope on top of all that.So Garnet being the black gal type is sort of a given considering the artists culture but inversely the people criticizing probably dont know a lot of his culture just as hes not likely to know a whole lot of theirs. So accusing him of whitewashing wasnt fair in the first place seeing as he has no cultural context of such a thing.I guess what Im saying is being a black kid that loves Japanese culture I find that Im uniquely in the wheelhouses to see both of these pretty clearly and say that it is just culture clash pure and simple.He was doing the gems in anime style anime style then means anime archetypes as it so often does. So it isnt surprising or upsetting to me really.,stevenuniverse,cq6bi3q,5,t5_2viyl

Hes dead to me said in a reminiscently casual tone Gregs Character Song Like a Comet  although I wish there was more time to it. True enough Greg meeting Rose at his empty concert is played exactly word for word just as I thought back all the way in episode . Basically the designs of Greg and the gems my favorite has to be either Pearl or Amethyst what with Pearls longer hair looking like a Thirteen year old Amethyst with her short hair and  what I assume to be a skirt. Pretty much they all looked fantastic. As much as Marty as a dick hes such a dick that I cant help but love to hate him. Sure enough What Pearl said was true they did have a gate back then keeping people off Beach city... Until Greg pretty much trashed it with his van. This gem of dialogue is Diabetes inducing Heartwarming Rose Youre awfully cute. And I really want to play with you. But your Life is short and you have dreams. I wont let you give up on everything you want.GregWell thats gonna be a problem youre everything I want! The Fact that it looks like Rose is a single mom with three daughters is adorable to look at when theyre all together. Really Hard to spot But if you look at Pearls design with Amethyst as the Owl perched on her arm. She looks awfully similar to a certain book character in a certain series Connie and Steven enjoy.Final Verdict? This is pretty much the episode I was waiting for when Greg first told his story to Steven all the way back in Season  and damn it did not disappoint.

Given that Steven is biological its even more likely that a gems physical form is reflective of their personality and that if their mind became corrupted their body would follow. Weve also seen both Amethyst and Lapis Lazuli manifested physical aberrations when their gems became damaged so transformation seems to be a clear indicator of something being wrong with a gem.Theres also a frame in Monster Buddies where the shilouette of the forming centipeedle seems to transit through a more human looking state,stevenuniverse,cqf825f,2,t5_2viyl

Im still of the belief that Amethyst was made in a controversial way and that these injector drone things were part of making a very powerful army very quickly. Its her hole sure but it looks veeeeeeery suspiciously like the other holes in the walls. Then again Pearl does mention earlier in that episode that the Homeworld Gems were going to do something awful to Earth that would be devastating to local inhabitants humans. If the theory that Kindergarten Gems were being planted  created there thats not a whole bunch of land all things considered. Maybe Kindergarten Gems like actual small children are horrible at keeping their powers intact which would be why they use other planets? Guh.

Connie practices tennis and violin regularly and is generally more patient than Steven so I think shed be comfortable with having structured lessons.If anything I think Connies antiauthoritarian streak would make her idolize Pearl and the other Crystal Gems.

3972079,0,t1_cr8w1dh,Oh no they had to spend a few weeks on an island paradise away from civilization. How awful. To recap what I said earlier I dont disagree with what Sadie did in the slightest. Lars is an ass and needed to spend some time away from society and as soon as danger actually presented itself she led them straight to the warp. Im a fan of dispensing tough love on people acting like assholes and Lars needed to detox his horrible traits badly. Sadie did nothing wrong.Also you make it sound like Sadie was trying to murder Lars with that fire salt. She had no idea what that stuff was going to actually do. By Stevens explanation it sounded like a kind of hot sauce. As far as Steven knew it was a powerful hot sauce. How does putting hot sauce on something make her sick and twisted? Admittedly it was a childish thing to do but it doesnt make her sick and twisted. And when it started to make flames shoot out of his mouth she did everything she could to help fix her mistake and made it clear that isnt what she wanted. That is the responsible adult thing to do. It also doesnt even begin to make them equal. What Sadie did in that situation she did by mistake. Lars was actively dodging work something I find deplorable if you have a job you goddamn better do it and not leave your coworkers to pick up the slack and manipulating Sadies emotions in order to do so. Not to mention when he thought she was slacking off that hypocritical piece of human garbage was going to give her shit for it.The things she says may not sound the most adult Im not apologizing after she mistakenly gives him something way past the order of hot sauce and dont look into it after she saves Lars from that monster but her gut reactions to situations leaping into danger multiple times to save a friend that makes her a responsible adult not a sick and twisted individual.,stevenuniverse,cr91tgh,1,t5_2viyl

The majority of people are still heterosexual and in our society America atleast you would normally only show your genitalia and get naked around the other sex if you were intending to be intimate with them.

4163859,0,t3_38fq10,I always figured that her water clones were like Pearls hologram in that they werent being controlled by her directly.

Not to mention the fact that Gems seem to have little to no respect for other creatures as a default Im rather shocked that Lapis even bothered keeping the fish alive in her tower.As a side note though I dont think Jaspers intentions were  evil  Id even argue that she doesnt really have any intentions for Earth persay. She seems at least to me very much like a soldier. Sure she enjoys fighting but she seems to prefer nonlethal methods of incapacitating her enemies.

4172688,0,t1_crvt7ns,Youre taking a general principle and applying it to an extreme situation in which it obviously wouldnt work. Yeah in general you dont want to slaughter captured enemies or treat them too badly because then no one will ever surrender to you and people may fight harder against you if you acquire a reputation for brutality beyond whats considered acceptable.But if you have a specific enemy who slaughtered huge swathes of your armies and who the men under you would have great reason to hate and want to see punished? It would be incredibly foolish politically and strategically speaking to spare that person  especially on some flimsy flighty unconvincing ideal like every life is precious.Sun Tzu was a pragmatist who would most definitely not advocate showing mercy to Lapis Lazuli in the scenario described in this comic. In fact hed probably advocate making a big show of killing her in as public and brutal a fashion as possible to boost morale. If Gems are anything like humans they love to see the wicked get their just deserts.EditASOIAF Book Spoilerss For anyone who reads the ASOIAF books think of Stannis Baratheons conversation with Asha Greyjoy. She offers to pay a hefty ransom in exchange for her brothers life and he replies that there isnt enough gold in her entire country. Theon Greyjoy murdered the sons of Ned Stark who was beloved throughout most of the North particularly among the mountain clans that Stannis is relying on to bolster his armies. He knows that every Northman in his army would abandon him in an instant if he showed Theon any kind of clemency.The dialogue in the comic makes clear the extent of Lapis killing spree and even lets us hear Gems begging for their loved ones to be spared. Would you keep taking orders from a leader who insists on sparing the murderer of your loved ones your comrades and their loved ones? Because every life is precious? No no leader is that charismatic.,stevenuniverse,crvw6o0,2,t5_2viyl
4173734,0,t3_38j6ja,Maybe she had fused with Greg before but fusion wouldnt have really solved the problem of giving up her physical form. It seemed as though only one of them Rose or Steven could have the gem at any given time. I think this is the reason why she had to give up her physical form. Steven needed the gem to live as Rose did so she had to make a choice. I dont think theyd go by ghost rules and let Rose jump into Gregs body or something when her entire being is actually just the gem itself. I think she truly wanted to have Steven and experience that together with Greg so I think it was for both of their sake. Greg doesnt seem like he would have ever wanted to let Rose go so I dont think it was his idea.,stevenuniverse,crw0gqk,1,t5_2viyl

Other than that theyre uploaded in duplets on Amazon Instant Itunes and Google Play roughly  hours after airing Hopefully CN gets them the files quicker for the event.There may be other more questionable options but discussing such would be in violation of Rule .

4276957,0,t1_cs7osbf,Well a big part of Pearls character seems to be that she is an enormous hypocrite. She acts like gems are inherently superior to humans yet she is the most humanlike gem of the three. She calls Amethyst reckless but has a past of recklessly risking her own life in order to protect Rose on numerous occasions. She pretends to be perfect but she is flawed.Thats what I love about this show. Nobody is perfect not even the one character who is meant to be perfect. In fact especially not her. The tragedy of Pearls character is that she has just as much growing up to do as Amethyst does just in different ways.,stevenuniverse,cs7qcn6,130,t5_2viyl

4294068,0,t3_3a69nn,I mean what happened was gtit was just Ronaldo talking about why the Crystal Gems arent safe for Beach City and that would have been a great episode if people started realising all the crazy shit that has been going on isnt going to stop but is going to get worse.Something happened it was a video of him explaining his thoughts on that him telling them to leave and his character growing to learn that he actually needs the CGs. There was a definitive conflict and resolution and character growth. If just I didnt like the episode is your thought fair enough man.But if nothing happened means no character development beyond character has thought then new thought is found and then thought and feelings change about that  no Homeworld plot directly do you also dislike.... Garnets Universe speaks for itself Shirt Club single argument could be made two characters have a thought both of those change Arcade Mania literally  change in character besides Garnet has  eyes Say Uncle non canonical nothing happened Lars and the Cool Kids Lars wants to be cool he fails they save them in the end also Steven just says once again that he never met his mom Love Letters Jamie is in love he is confused he is let down Open Book other than Steven likes Connie which duh arguably literally nothing happened besides a little adventure Joy Ride Steven works too hard Steven relaxes the gems realize that they are too hard on him thats literally all that happened development wise Reformed Amethyst has trouble expressing herself honestly Amethyst eventually expresses herself honestly Steven and the Stevens Literally nothing happens character development or plot wise in the end as the Steven who learned anything dies House Guest Greg is injured and lives with the CGs we find out that he lied to be with Steven they both end up working together to fix the Geode. Character development Greg loves his son a lot. Also Steven is happy his dad is there then mad that his dad lied and then forgives him in about  seconds flat Full Disclosure Steven decides to say no to humanity Steven continues to try and say no Steven reconciles eventually Keep Beach City Weird Ronaldo has ideas and Steven follows Steven realizes ideas are false and tries to help Ronaldo by acting as if theyre real Ronaldo finds out that his ideas are false and switches up his feelings on that Horror Club Lars and Ronaldo do not like each other we find out whyI mean if you dont like all of those for that reason fair enough.I think otherwise I didnt like this episode is a fairer response than to use that logic. Obviously those ones have more going on in the actual episode arguably but as far as development of plot moving forward or character development those all either had the same amount arguably the tiniest amount possible more or less.,stevenuniverse,cs9nwe5,8,t5_2viyl

Im leaning toward thinking that it was reserved for certain castes in certain ways and that the Crystal Gems were more free and open about fusing together.But other than that detail Im liking this theory during the original war Homeworld was too uptight and socially constrained to be able to use fusion for war and it contributed to their loss. Since then theyve become rigid in a more technological way still unable to form the love needed for a healthy fusion so they force it in an unhealthy way.,stevenuniverse,csaj6ss,3,t5_2viyl

We were caught in a brief skirmish with the local enemy squadron as well as a visit from General Ant. We bantered for a bit but most importantly the outcome is this. I am proud to say my men and I have successfully destroyed the production lines for the Feel drones and Tear Harvesters as well as burning the remaining schematics for their designs. They will not be bothering us again Soldiers! It was a tough battle but for tomorrow we now need only worry about the Fifth and final bombardment that a sir General Ant and Rebecca have planned. This is surely a day to be remembered. We have almost won!,stevenuniverse,csb9fo0,2,t5_2viyl
4308368,0,t3_3aayko,I feel so bad for Pearl. She did act like a dick but I finally understand. Her feels for Rose Quartz are romantic not simply because of her knighthood.The metaphor of fusionlove is so interesting in this context. It seems that the stronger the bond the more humanoid the fusion remains. The weakerunsuitable bonds stray away from humanoid toward something more grotesque and unstable. We see this in fusions like Garnet vs Malachite.Rainbow Quartz I WANT TO SEE MORE OF HER is the rd fusion weve seen with only one set of arms although with  sets of eyes. This is like Garnet who also is only with one set of legsarms but with a rd eye. She is metaphorically I suppose one whole step toward being a perfect humanoid seemingly undifferentiated from a nonfusion gem. The only things to give it away are the gems on her hands and the rd eye. Stevonnie may actually be an exception to the rule simply because she is part human. If not however because we may see Steven fuse with other humans at some point that would make Stevonnie the stablest fusion. Only one set of everything.We see what happens with fusions that are forced between unwanting parties. Malachite and the gem shard experiments had littletono resemblance to a humanoid. Malachites own emotional stability was... well there was none. They were two seperate entities vying for control of the body. The Gem Shards didnt seem to have a stable consciousness.Fusion seems to be a taboo now in Homeworld Gem culture. Its only seen as a tactic. Strictly utilitarian. They dont seem to understand it as an intimate expression of two Gems emotions for one another. This explains why Peridot could look at these experiments without difficulty but Garnet who knows very well what fusion can be was so horrified to the point of becoming unstable.,stevenuniverse,csba1q8,11,t5_2viyl

For a long time the area was just uninhabited coastline and we have nothing so far that suggest that there was anything significant there before beach city. Since all the super outerspacey stuff didnt start happening until recently the only way stuff about the gems would get noticed is if someone related it to higher ups.

I like the idea that she cant think about her romantic feelings for Rose without feeling guilt because of Steven and how important hes become to her. She cant have both and she wouldnt be able to choose between them anymore but she would have been able to easily for the first few years of his life.

4433959,0,t3_3btrta,The episode Coach Steven.  I dunno why but it speaks to a lot of why I like the show.  Stevens an impressionable kid and he tends to like a lot of things that are cool.  His genuine strength is and always has been his ability to inspire others to greatness though he rarely seems to see it that way.  And the song Strong in the Real Way is just one of my favorites.Also Pearl had to confront something that always seems to be at the back of her mind  Shes not a combat gem.  Hinted at in Sworn to the Sword with the line Deep down you know youre not built for fighting.  And here she literally had to fight someone she knew was going to physically outmatch her.  Just a really good moment for the character and the first episode that really showed me the potential Steven has.Of course Steven seems to be taking advantage of that potential in later episodes and has really proven to be hella competent by now.,stevenuniverse,cspl6fy,5,t5_2viyl

Which means theyre going to have to depose the current homeworld leaders.None of the Crystal Gems strike me as being someone who would want to be a king so someone would have to take the reins of the empire.Who better to lead an empire than someone who truly understands both the heights of power and the true depths of despair?  Someone with experience that has been truly humbled to the point power can no longer go to her head?It would allow Steven and Connie to be the figurehead leaders of the Gem Empire while being free to go back home to Earth while Lapis sits on the throne and actually runs things on a day to day basis avoiding the power vacuum that would tear any empire apart.,stevenuniverse,csykyo3,16,t5_2viyl

Furthermore I just stated that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but thank you for restating it like it was your idea. I know my reasons are no better than others. I promote healthy discussion and conversation while you try to calm me down and act like Im the one excluding people.... I only said stop watching because he posts a hate thread and then calls me out when I was just discussing the thoughts. Steven universe should never be a hateful place. We should all listen to each other and learn to love things for the way they are. This should be a thread helping people love the things they hate not just supporting hate.

Fusion the extreme expression of relationship for Gems is quickly becoming the theme of season  as evidenced by the last StevenBomb.  We have explored some of the aspects of loving fusion Garnet and spiteful fusion Rainbow Quartz the cluster.  This seems like the perfect time for the show to tackle a rarely seen form of relationship.  Singleness.It would be great to see the show deal with the fact that not everyone has to be in a romantic relationship.

Pearl wanted to feel strong and have Garnet celebrate in getting those extra victories.Rainbow Quartz was made to show Greg that Gems are alien and that Greg will never be in true harmony with Rose Quartz. It was to save Greg.Whats most important is that Pearl views fusion is an radically different way than Garnets intimate reasons. Pearl shares a similar perspective to Jasper. While Jasper looks down on fusions Jasper and Pearl both agree that fusions make them stronger and more likely to succeed. For Garnet being strong is just a sideeffect of being a really good conversation in harmony.,stevenuniverse,ct2iwy0,16,t5_2viyl

Garnet was describing their relationship when she said they were one person but when that relationship changes unexpectedly or otherwise destabilizes Stevonnie more strongly resembles Steven and Connie and Garnet starts to become Ruby and Sapphire again.It can certainly be nonbinary representation but not purely in the context of the show  otherwise one would run into a mess with the relationship metaphora Garnet used when Stevonnie first fused. Then you would need to contextualize what Stevonnie means within the SU universe and within the shows commentary and in both instances literally and metaphorically.

Steven refuses to let Pearl go without chasing her because ohana means family and family means no one is left behind so a rescue mission to the homeworld is mounted.As it turns out Yellow Diamond views all of the gems returning from Earth as defective and plans to destroy them.

But for this kind of subject I think is healthier to separate what obviously the show tries to represent and achieves in a good way that flows naturally. With what is canon within the show itself both what it has been said in the show and from the creators and to my understanding is that alien magical gem rocks are sexless and they are not gay nor straight or any other type of gender concept that we humas use for biological beings.,stevenuniverse,ct4npoq,3,t5_2viyl

4557909,0,t1_ct53ry9,It seems an awful lot to me like youre projecting some form of your own insecurities onto this whole situation or something youre letting yourself be taken in by one side out of some internal struggle or a memory of something similar happening to you.I cant say much about the PearlRose relationship because well I shouldnt need to. Ive seen exactly how those things work out and its never good. Pearl would have hurt Rose if given the chance and not intentionally  obsessive idolization is never ever the foundation of a healthy relationship especially with such a big power differential. The fact of the matter is that Garnet was on Roses side and no means no. She was doing what was best for everyone Pearl just drew the short straw thats how feelings work we dont live in magic rainbow land where everything works out and everyone is a welladjusted and perfectly functional being even in a cartoon. Pearl has just as much right to be openly upset at Garnet as any Neckbeard in the world does when they inevitably bring up the term friendzone because thats literally what it was. Garnet HAD to step in and unfortunately make it very clear to Pearl to make sure she didnt get in the way and ruin things which would have hurt everyone involved again. I agree it sucks and its awful to put that on one person but it wasnt an act of malice I didnt see it rubbed in her face although Garnet does have a very clinical and flat delivery not at all warm or apologetic towards the position Pearl was in that much is true. In fact I find it hard to see any of these supposed instances where Garnet was harder on Pearl than anyone else in the show. She doesnt really spend much time on ANYONES emotional wellbeing unless it directly effects the team. Call that a negative part of Garnet if you want thats perfectly fair but Pearl is the only one youre taking this personally for.Part of this is necessity that you seem to be missing. Garnet has a sense of mission and purpose. Both Ruby and Sapphire make that clear in their short appearances as well. She herself says she gets carried away and that doesnt just refer to Sugilite. But she has a clear understanding which is part of why shes looked up to. Garnet would rather have not fused at all if there was a way to avoid it so in that sense yes she used both Amethyst and Pearl to get the job done  a goal they all agree is important for one reason or another. Much like my previous friendzone comment I cant honestly sit here and take you seriously if you intent to hold Garnets lack of feelings against her it absolutely in no way her fault that she doesnt feel the same way as either of them do about fusing.The only reason she was involved in any way is because presumably Opal wouldnt have been enough for the job and the fate of the world is a tad more important than whos crushing on who. All parties knew exactly what they were getting into it was a mission not a date. This isnt a game to her why is that such a big deal to you?,stevenuniverse,ct556g5,2,t5_2viyl

4578654,0,t1_ct7qb9n,I was comparing Rose to the Gems we know of. Rose for now has shown more powers than any other Gem. She can create life she has her healing abilities and her shield is shown be amazingly strong. For now only Lapis has shown power to match her own and there are many theories regarding her as well. Plus these are only the powers weve seen directly  add Lion into the fray how did she create him? Did she create him? Where did all his powers come from? How are they related? how Steven managed to destroy the water images Lapis created through a sort of shockwave his possible telepathic powers Roses light cannons... Shes a pretty big deal is what I was getting at.We dont know what the context is sure but you said Doesnt hold much weight... or any and I find that hard to believe considering all weve seen her in.  colours Pink rebels millenia later we see old marks with  colours and the new one that only has . We also know of a Yellow Diamond and yellow is one of the colours. See why I think saying its based on little doesnt make sense?The descriptions are close to Roses character as we know her yes.My rebuttal however... Known as the Supreme Nurturer Jasper is a stone of grounding and stability providing comfort and security strength and healing. Its presence balances the aura to a level of wholeness and peace and acts as a reminder that one is not here on the physical plane simply for oneself but to bring joy and substance to others.Taken from Crystal Vaults. Youll see good things about every gem or precious stone more or less. Selling rocks is an old scam game with huge profits. Rebecca might look at them she might get ideas from them but there isnt a single canon description of these gems and it can be all random. Stones with descriptions of their divine powers that were written to sell and polymorphing sentient space rocks who have personalities flaws history likes and so on arent exactly the same.Just my opinion anyway. ,stevenuniverse,ct7qtom,3,t5_2viyl

4581469,0,t3_3drssw,Amethyst to Steven.... Heres a great way to put it. In human terms but also in inshowdynamic terms she literally is Roses daughter. Everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked and Rose died in childbirth. Mind you a child she had saying Yep sorry kiddo I want another one a HUMAN one one of those things? Over there? That you relate to more than us but arent one of? Yeah Imma fuck one this one! right here! greg! and then die and leave a baby in my place! BTW youre gonna help raise it.Im not shitting on Rose but from Amethysts perspective thats very much what happened. Maybe she internalized it different but really that is what happened. The other two gems to her are kind of like Aunts who helped raise her.Amethyst is actually the one Steven calls for first in a lot of situations. Ones where he isnt in immediate mortal danger but like is scared? I wanna think of examples but also I am busy so theres that.I cant wait for an AmethystSteven episode. Weve had Amethyst episodes where Steven was there and thats cool but it was really about her. Its been since Tiger Millionaire that weve had one. Amethyst is a gem and culturally being raised by them has a lot to add to that but culturally she is really really an Earthling. She literally is an Earthling but she in every way IS one of us. She isnt nescessarily human shes definitely the closer to humans compared to any other earthly being very close but point being shes one of us earth folk. And there arent any other gems like her. Shes not just in the tiny family she has but overall the only gem that ever has been like her. Shes unique.Steven is a human but hes being raised by gems partially. So while hes DEFINITELY earthly and of earth and one of us and obviously a human he also is a gem. Something  unique to him. And beyond that think back to the end of We Need To Talk... he has that realization he also IS NOT A HUMAN. He is entirely unique and alone.Hes the human thats closest to a gem shes the gem thats closest to a human and no one will ever really understand either one of them for their role in the universe.But out of any human gem dog cat mushroom alien or anything the two of them can relate to each other on that most basic level more than anyone else. And we literally have had one episode about their relationship so far Tiger Millionaire and an auxiliary second one On The Run which was really just about Amethyst gave us some backstory and a bit to Steven and had his character flirt with the idea without him actually realizing that he is in fact a No Home Boy.So yeah callin it. That comes up next if not soon.,stevenuniverse,ct83i7v,22,t5_2viyl

4612968,0,t1_ctbt9bj,Yeah this is an issue I see a lot in pop culture fandoms  the want to say this thing  this other thing and should  be talked about and understood as such within the context of the show. To me that isnt forcing an allegory thats bad allegorical thinking. I guess people may disagree on this point but I think allegory works with more fluidity than that. The structure of the themes can be understood as another mechanism outside the realm of the narrative but it should not devalue the relevance these elements have within the narrative.But particularly in the case of fusion and what it means I dont think applying lessons learned from moments involving fusion to issues of consent and sexuality is necessarily invalid. Fusion is an analogue to relationships and the themes from moments in fusion can be applied to issues of communication and will with regards to interfacing with another person  be it platonically sexually what have you. This however is not to say that fusion is specifically sexual specifically romantic or whatever because it is not it is not a specific model of human relationships. Rather the general lessons can be applied to life in general.What is invalid is saying that fusion is a metaphor for some other specific thing and its relevance to the characters should only be understood that way. Like for instance if someone wanted to say fusion is sex so Pearl raped Garnet in the Sardonyx episodes that would be forcing an allegory in my mind. However saying that there is an issue of agenda and trust in that moment which can be applied to sexual consent and communication in real life that to me seems legitimate. ,stevenuniverse,ctc1n5k,2,t5_2viyl

I dont need literally  accuracy that every question ever is made to calrify headcanons to justify an argument prohibiting or otherwise being tactful about asking questions connected to them. My point still stands this headcanon is obviously a popular and shared one and its clearly being made the subject of question with ulterior intent to clarify it as false or true.

4637839,0,t1_ctf2jcf,Okay I havent watched season  in a while so itd be a lot easier to see where youre coming from if you could give me an example because from what I remember of season  Garnet her decisions actually helped progress the story. I legit think that Serious Steven wouldnt have happened if Garnet wouldnt have convinced Pearl and Amethyst that Steven could handle it. Like she always has his back and Ive never really seen her tear down anyone that I can think of. The worst thing in season  that I can think of her doing right now apart from I thought violence would be the answer in So Many Birthdays which didnt actually hurt Steven was saying We kept Amethyst. In hindsight that was kinda messed up.With regards to Garnet being unhelpful when it comes to letting Pearl and Amethyst heal and bond her decision to send the three of them together in Giant Woman is actually what led to them forming Opal for the first time in who knows how long. Fusion is an experience but I also think its an understanding and its reaching and understanding and Pearl and Amethyst have very little in common but that day they understood that they both love and care for Steven and did what was necessary to save his life. Because of Garnets decision.I honestly just cant see what youre saying without a specific instance. I see that shes got her issues but I dont see any of the things that youre saying. ,stevenuniverse,ctf61lv,3,t5_2viyl

We know from things like the view we got of the Earth in Jailbreak that the coastline is different from reality in addition to a lot of other geographical changes. The coat line is caused by a number of factors including the tides. Most of the time we see the moon its a half moon. Most of the other times we see it to my knowledge at least its been from a different location. Therefore I propose that as a tactic during the war Homeworld altered the moon such that it was put into geosynchronous orbit in a gambit to destroy the tides and wipe out a significant chunk of life on Earth. At some point the Crystal Gems devised a method of artificially recreating the tides resulting in similar but not quite right coastlines and also geological features as the changing tides would have an equal effect on weather patterns over thousands of years.,stevenuniverse,ctfy4x2,2,t5_2viyl

4672301,0,t3_3evqw9,The Diamonds are a caste of gems not specific ones.Peridot is able to directly contact Yellow Diamond but thats not really feasible she is a tech caste gem and her sole job was to check on the clusters a science project that was abandoned along with earth. She would not contact gemkinds supreme leader unless she was of a higher caste and that is clearly not the case.However as it has been confirmed that there are multiple of each gem it is most likely that The Great Diamond Authority is not a small group but an entire council or hierarchy of diamonds. The Yellow Diamonds are in charge of technology or maybe even the only ones left which would make Peridot that much more likely to contact one.Jasper only came along as a bodygaurd Peridot is not capable of combat on the same level as warrior or combattrained nonwarrior gems and as something had been destroying the galaxy warp she expected minor resistance from the locals.Rose Quartz only became Jaspers focus when it was revealed that Steven had her gem she was only expecting gems in the first place because Lapis had informed her and Peridot.If this is true then Rose being a Diamond is even more viable there were many diamonds before the war if my theory is correct and it would create much less of a political catastrophe than if one out of four leaders did.,stevenuniverse,ctjhtpe,2,t5_2viyl

I just get the feeling that a lot of people who are upset by a lack of male gems arent the same people who will be fighting for female characters in other franchises. Thats all I think that there is to say on the matter. I would argue that the male cast of characters on SU is just as likable as the female cast of characters but whatever. The point made is mildly valid. This entire post lost all credibility towards the end though when SWC started ripping on Matt for no fucking reason. SWC is garbage IMO.

I want to meet the Gems who were responsible for handling those operations who took the orders Rose wouldnt give to anyone else  elite commandos who efficiently and remorselessly carried out infiltration sabotage and assassinations against Homeworld forces possibly starting before the rebellion was even declared.It would provide a whole new perspective on the conflict driving home Gregs point about there being no such thing as a good war. It would remind us that just because the Crystal Gems fought to save life on Earth doesnt mean they were nice people. It would introduce endless potential for conflict. Will these hardened veterans accept Garnet as their leader? What will they do in response to threats like Peridot and Malachite if they havent been dealt with already? What will they think when they find out that the leader they respected decided to sacrifice her own life to give birth to a human child who now possesses his mothers power?

Lapis is very much characterized as a young adult you can argue she might be a child by gem standards but since youve only vaguely argued what those standards could be and havent given much evidence as to how she is a child in any sense thats a dead horse you keep beating. Yes its my opinion but since were both arguing opinions pointing that out is redundant and irrelevant. Some opinions are more accurate than others and theyre all overruled by facts so standing on the principle of having an opinion is more myopic bullshit. I call you myopic because you stubbornly narrowmindedly arguing its acceptable for Lapis to be romantically involved with Steven with increasingly asinine rationalizations and conjecture with very dubious evidence in canon. You keep finding new ways to contort logic to make it acceptable while at the same time disparaging me for your continued decision to perpetuate this conversation by responding. If youre so busy with other things go do those other things I dont care that Im apparently pulling you away from them and I never asked to know since its your responsibility to them not mine.Even as an older teen its still a teenager romantically pursuing someone around preteen age. Like per the OP to . Thats still reprehensible. Older teen or young adult neither options are very acceptable and just dismissing it with another reprehensible interpretation isnt a strong argument. At the least shes thousands of years old with the experience and development that implies. Being trapped in a mirror only has the discernible consequence of inducing traumatic stress responses. Yes sexual isnt always an equation but a romantic pursuit of disparate ages is still reprehensible. Even if they never have sex someone in their later teens or early adulthood dating someone underaged is a relationship with an imbalanced power dynamic in which the younger person can be manipulated or taken advantage ofand not necessarily in a sexual manner.,stevenuniverse,ctss9u4,1,t5_2viyl

Garnet is A L W A Y S in a position of power over everyone else by merit of her physicality alone not to mention her leadership role. She has zero regard for the emotional impact that her careless actions have on her teammates even before the Sardonyx thing why didnt she talk to Amethyst about how upset Amethyst was over not being allowed to fuse with her? If she had listened for one goddamn second maybe she would have understood WHY her teammates like fusing with her and come to a better understanding of the power she holds over them before Pearl betrayed her. Pearl took advantage of Garnet but calling her abusive is just irresponsible. Garnet has been emotionally toxic for a lot longer. Pearls actions were a direct result of Garnets insistence on being a cipher rather than engaging with how her teammates are feeling. Pearl cant abuse Garnet. Garnet will always be in that position of power and Pearl will always come from a place of subordination. That doesnt make Pearl justified in her actions. But it doesnt mean that Garnet gets a free pass either. ,stevenuniverse,ctuwqik,0,t5_2viyl

4774119,0,t1_ctwaoke,gtDue to Alexandrite and Sugilite. Malachite Jasper and Lapiss fusion ends in ite so many people speculated it was a  gem fusion. That lead people to believe Jasper was a fusion because it was obvious Lapis wasnt.Thats a coincidence but I can see how people would come to that conclusiongt  All single gems we had seen up til that point had only irises no pupils.Pearl in Lars and the Cool Kids was shown with pupils. Rainbow Quartz was not shown with pupils either. People readily pointed both of these things out.gtLastly Jasper is the only gem so far that has banding on them. All other gems weve seen have a solid skin color. When Steven Bomb  happened we saw forced fusions which all had banding on them. Therefore it solidified that Jasper was a fusion in our minds.I wouldnt say the forced fusions had banding on them as much as they had different patches of color poking out from holes in a grey sheath.

4840041,0,t1_cu4m49g,But would Steven have still been half Gem? Like would a Gem grow inside of Fem!Greg because something about Roses DNA having the grow a magical rock on your body command somewhere in the code? Or maybe Steven would just come out as nothing but a gem and not form a hardlight body until after he came out. I really want to ask one of the creators of the show this because this would be huge if it were true. It would mean that Steven would be able to have a gem child and would be the key to repopulating the Gems without using Kindergartens. And its also somewhat plausible. Why else would the Crewniverse specifically go out of their way to specify that Gems can be male but none of them are. Id say its just because its progressive to have an allfemale crazy advanced species but then why would they have said that they could be male if they wanted to? They wouldnt just do it so people would stop whining because that would be really uncharacteristic of them to do something to not piss people off which theyve clearly been shown to love doing. But foreshadowing something with a detail that a lot of people are bound to notice but no attention is drawn to in the show is exactly the kind of thing theyd pull. I really need to ask this next time theres an AMA.TLDR I kept rambling and now I might have pieced together a puzzle.,stevenuniverse,cu4mil8,3,t5_2viyl

4903528,0,t3_3i19zg,Its interesting but the time scales off.Heres the temple as shown in the Lion  video tape Moss is growing but the arms still there and the paths still intact. That places the destruction pointedly after this either it happened when Rose was heavily pregnant or it happened at a point when Steven had already been born. Given that Rose is very heavily pregnant in the video theres not really much of a chance for it to have happened while Rose was still around.That practically rules out Bismuth as a possible cause of the destruction. Rose had to have bubbled Bismuth and put it in Lion and that wouldnt have been possible if she was too busy being Steven. So yeah. Interesting theory but no.As for what did cause the destruction maybe there was some big attack around the time that Steven was still living with Greg?

4980678,0,t1_cum6ax0,What do you mean guilty pleasure? That show is pretty good. It might seem like easy gags and toilet humor but heres the cold hard truth. This show Teen Titans Go! one of the few shows where the exclamation mark may or may not be part of the shows title is in actuality a show with easy gags and toilet humor but it actually dares to polish said humor into something new. You know those episodes in series where suddenly the sound disappears through some mystical or magical force and the heroes need to find out how to bring sound back? Teen Titans Go! did such an episode but instead of the heroes trying to figure out how to bring sound back they just went meh. Then Cyborg is all like look guys and he moves a spring which makes a bwoing sound but sounds exactly like Cyborg doing that sound. So they find out they can imprint sound on everythingthe point is the episode is hilarious you should definitely check it out. Its called And the Award for  Sound Design Goes To Rob. You will highly unlikely be disappointed. Watch it with an open mind. Seriously you might thank me later.Point is the show has quite a few jokes that might seem like easy jabs to the old series but theyre easy jabs to the old series done right. Theyre never really meanspirited always with a sort of respect. I mean I loved the old show dont get me wrong but the difference is I dont cling to the old.My favorite HannaBarbera character is ScoobyDoo and when somebody showed me a screenshot of ScoobyDoo! Mystery Incorporated from the very first episode around the time it first got aired I was like this I have to see and after the first episode I was like this isnt so bad. So I went to the Internet and people were like They ruined ScoobyDoo!Point is people are too clouded by nostalgia. The Looney Tunes Show for example was a good show. Not perfect not excellent good. I liked it. I liked Lolas characterization definitely more than her portrayal in Space Jam. In the Looney Tunes Show she actually had personality. She was a genuine idiot almost hanging to full retard but she was also her own independent woman. She was Bugs obsessed but she didnt let her life be lead by him.Point is nostalgia. Its what kills animation now whatever everybody here thinks it is. The animation of ye olde days are long dead theyre never coming back but they also shouldnt. I mean how far back do you want to go? Do you want to go full HannaBarbera where there wasnt much of a plot? Do you want to go s where cartoons were either dark or nonsensical goofy? Do you want to have the days of Powerpuff Girls or Dexters Laboratory back? I mean those cartoons are dead they had their purpose back then but right now theyre not really pushing boundaries.And in ten years Adventure Time Steven Universe Gravity Falls theyre all going to stop being relevant. Animation changes the way we tell stories in animation changes. Ben  is yesterdays news Steven Universe is todays news who knows in what direction animation will go? Maybe televised animation will make way for web animation. Frederator Studios with their Cartoon Hangover already is exploring this brave new world.We will always long back to the old days. I remember when I sat in front of the television waiting for Captain N The Game Master to air. Its not a great show but I liked it for what it was and I still appreciate it but a kid doesnt have the same attachment as I have. But they make their own memories they will remember their childhood they way they want to remember it. We cant force them to watch what we want. Teen Titans Go! is actually what most want to see. My brother of four loves Transformers Robots In Disguise. Its his choice. He doesnt like Steven Universe or Adventure Time. Thats also his choice. Doesnt mean his choices are shitty its just what he decides to watch what he decides to like. Uncle Grandpa is one such shows he doesnt really mind he doesnt specifically like it but he also doesnt hate it. He loves Ninjago and to be honest i love it as well. I ship Nya and Skylor. By the way I almost literally squeed when I saw Skylor in the latest season of Ninjago. I mean I did expect them to make a reference to her but never expected her to actually show up in the series albeit briefly.Anyway to make a long story short nostalgia is nice but it will cloud your judgement of newer shows.,stevenuniverse,cumcoln,33,t5_2viyl

5022899,0,t1_curfzd2,Well the crashed Pink Diamond ship Peridot lured them into was somewhere in Brazil IIRC. Also Pearl notably became familiar with the European of knighthood so she was probably around there at that time. Probably safe to assume that there was stuff going on worldwide. The Kindergarten was in America but the Gem war could well have been all over the world. And its pretty dark to contemplate but OP mentioned the SU US being colonised later than in the real world  maybe that couldve been because of a lower overall population less of an impetus to move out and find more land? People having died in the war putting a dent in the global population that it couldve taken a while to recover from. Could be a similar thing behind WWII never having taken place  less people less need for Lebensraum...I dunno I dont think theyll get into the alternate historical or geographical stuff too much I cant really see much more than hints at the bigger picture being given. Still its fun to consider worldbuilding and stuff.Also regarding the year Im pretty sure its been confirmed someone that time in the Steven Universe... universe... runs roughly parallel to realworld time.

5074244,0,t3_3kgn30,Actually the ONLY reason Steven found out about this is because he insisted that Connie take the sword and Dr. M confiscated it.  The fusion experiment was already in the hospital.How much stuff has been going on that the Crystal Gems have not contained because they are no longer really functioning as a group to deal with Gem problems?  I bet a lot of things have happened since Greg knocked the fence down  Rose went from being distracted to being dead to being Steven.  Amethyst was probably always just kind of an asset during easy missions  being a kid.  Garnet was the best person to carry out one man missions assigned to her and vetted by future vision  but without Rose she pretty much likes to break stuff and walk around underwater and avoid the other Gems.  After the fence came down she probably enjoyed having the extra time freed up not having to hide every Gem monster and mistake from humans. And Pearl would have worked tirelessly to please Rose and probably had a self satisfied attitude about keeping humans and Gem stuff separate until Rose just decided Greg was more than a phase.  Some time after that Pearl probably just quit trying to mop up the messes no one had thanked her for handling before.  By the time Steven moves in with them Pearl just vaguely pays for things and makes the most minimal effort to scold Amethyst for using her Gem powers against humans and doesnt really try any more.I bet most humans in Steven Universes world have seen a lot of Gem stuff  and they dont think of it as weird so much as difficult to explain.  Only those like Greg who are familiar with the Crystal Gems would know the connection and associate all the weird stuff with the Gems.  Most humans would be like Ronaldo and come to their own conclusions  even if they know that the Gems and Gem fusions are a literal part of the landscape in Beach City.,stevenuniverse,cuxmzrb,1,t5_2viyl

Like with Sadie and her mom or you and almost killing me.Im glad they changed it to end on the note of Sadie calling her mom though.

5175677,0,t1_cv9ju8h,No you werent.  Youve been arguing this as a thesis because you think you have a clever way to dismiss the whole sexuality debate in a way that makes you feel intellectually superior.If you are sincere about always under the impression that Gems were asexual then you need to revise your impressions to accept the lore set out in Lion  and On The Run which simply makes your assumption of asexuality wrong  because those episodes happened and they combine to debunk your asexual definition of Gems . . Rose does not produce Steven asexually.  The one example of reproduction we have set out that a Gem has nearly managed is clearly defined as having been at least an attempt at sexual reproduction.  And its failure to fulfill the definition of sexual reproduction is in the failure of Rose to REPRODUCE as an individual ie create another life without just giving up her own not in her failure to conform with the sexual portion of Stevens conception ie  Rose just transformed herself rather than reproducing  BUT she used part of Gregs input in a manner that supported HIS portion of the sexual equation in terms of having a son and . We have been specifically informed that Gems dont reproduce themselves as individuals  but instead are made with injectors and victim planets and kindergartens etc.  This is NOT asexual reproduction for Gems  it is something else.,stevenuniverse,cv9uxzw,1,t5_2viyl

While irritating it makes the show feel more real and relatable. I also feel like with characters like Lars and Ronaldo that have had a significant amount of airtime you feel that much more satisfied when you learn why they are like that. It makes them more complex. I also have some problems with people saying that SU isnt as good because its not as funny or comedy driven as Gravity Falls or as creative as Adventure time because thats obviously wasnt the intent of the creators.

Because the description for When It Rains only says Steven is helping a friend people are linking the two episodes together thinking its part of a redemption arc for one of the Homeworld gems.

5221149,0,t3_3mizux,Not sure why you were downvoted this is a pretty good question. I dont think that Pearls sacrifices were wrong as much as they were unhealthy. Steven felt very uncomfortable thinking about people laying down their lives for him. Despite the fact that he is important he doesnt like thinking about his life as more important than someone elses. He explains to Connie that he would rather fight alongside her as opposed to fighting behind her. He sees her as an equal and not as a pawn. Its unhealthy because Pearl right from the getgo thought of herself as one of Roses pawnsshe never saw her life to be worth as much as Roses was. I also think its worth noting that Watermelon Stevens came out way before Sworn to the Sword. I think part of it may be that Steven is just sick of people sacrificing or endangering themselves for him. Between the CGs Rose Lapis etc. he has had to see a lot of people lay it all on the line for him. Steven is a really sensitive kid and I think it bothers him that hes often put in such a helpless position while the people he loves including Baby Melon get hurt for his sake. ,stevenuniverse,cvfc9bf,7,t5_2viyl

If theyd all gotten captured then theyd all be trapped on the ship.  But then if Rose had been there her shield and battle experience might have won them the fight against Jasper even with heavy artillery as backup.  Of course Lapis also wouldnt have been there.  Maybe it would have just been Peridot and Jasper or there could have been another Earth veteran with them.Of course if Steven hadnt been around they also might not have caught the robinoids at all though they still might have.  One did land right next to the temple and they did used to hang out on the beach sometimes and Peridot might have been able to get to the kindergarten with no one knowing.

5269737,0,t1_cvkprb3,Building off of this theory Id guess that the diamonds were divided thusly Pink Diamond was in charge of colonizationoff world non military affairs this would explain her increased contact with Earth and subsequent defection. She would be the lowest of the diamonds and consequently most in touch with the people. Military prowess would be necessary which is why she could lead a rebellion and win but so would a thinking and feeling mind.Yellow Diamond was probably the militarypolicegeneral enforcement leader. I dont know about you but when Peridot says Ive got no response from Yellow Diamond that threw me for a bit of a loop because why would a vast gem empire allow for a technician to contact a supreme ruler? Yes it may have been through an intermediary but the general vibe I got from her distress signals and Jaspers references Yellow Diamond seems to be a military leader more than supreme royalty. Also from the perspective of the symbol Yellow is on the right symbolizing the right hand of the Diamond rule more on that later maybe Im reading a bit too much into it.Blue Diamond is a bit of a stretch but I think shes in charge of specialist gemsRampD sort of thing. Think about it Sapphire and Lapis Lazuli are both blue with very similar color palettes and the lighter shades of their palettes being very similar to Blue Diamonds symbol. Thinking about it now future vision could have enormous tactical application and water manipulation while implied to be much less useful on homeworld might be and indeed has been much more useful on planets with more water. So I could definitely see that. Also building off of her position in the symbol Blue would be the left hand traditionally used to symbolize unorthodox and unscrupulous methods as a lefty I found out that the word sinister comes from the latin word for leftWhite Diamond rules them all. Her position is the highest in the  and  diamond symbol making her the head to the hands of Yellow and Blue. Additionally a white diamond is one without mineral impurities such as boron or something in that vein hehe like mineral vein that make a diamond blue. So shes pure so to speak. This would be very much in line with the caste system that homeworld seems to be using and it wouldnt surprise me if White Diamond herself was the progenitor of it.,stevenuniverse,cvl9nq8,2,t5_2viyl

And to make that happen he totally played her.The handholding thing?  Classic mom trick holding a kids hand to keep him from running off.  He wasnt letting her out of his sight.And the mutant attack? He could have done something  hes gotten good with his shield.  He could have at least gotten them back to the warp pad.  But instead he played innocent stareyed Steven who needs to be saved.  The Crystal Gems show up they look like the heroes Peridot needs.  Shes in.Even without Future Vision Steven saw the potential for good in Peridot.  Just like Rose.EDIT ooh...what if Im wrong about being without Future Vision?  In the past Garnet shared her Future Vision by kissing Steven.  What if it wasnt the physical act but the act of showing affection  and the I love you was her way of giving him a small degree of FV  enough to see Peridots potential?Or am I in Ronaldo territory here? ,stevenuniverse,cvlfsp4,20,t5_2viyl

Youre really going sink to that level?How disappointing. Fine. Lets list your lies out again You lied when you claimed that Sugilite has never been formed consensually. Amethyst is shown to enthusiastically consent to her first summoning that we see. You lied when you claimed that Amethyst is dependent on Garnet and has no choice but to obey her. There are multiple cases of Amethyst disobeying Garnet sometimes openly defying her without consequence at that. You lied when you claimed that Garnet formed Sugilite to punish Pearl for being annoying and interrupting Amethyst. You lied when you claimed Garnet was trying to escape responsibility for Sugilites actions. Garnet explicitly takes responsibility for Sugilite twice. You lied when you claimed Garnet verbally abused Pearl after Alexandrite split up. You lied when you claimed that Garnet pressured Pearl and Amethyst to form Opal. You lied when you claimed that Steven coerced Pearl and Amethyst into forming Opal by nearly getting himself killed. Steven did not put himself in danger the giant bird put him in danger. He was doing the only thing he could to keep out of danger in that situation  hiding in the temple. You lied when you claimed that Garnet praised him for this because a it didnt happen and b Garnet wouldnt have known at the time she congratulated him even if it had happened. You lied when you claimed that Garnet goaded Steven and Connie into fusing.There may be more this is all from your original post. These lies youve told have already been quoted by multiple people including me in case youre thinking of sinking even lower and editing it. Note that I havent included all the times youve drawn a conclusion based on a biased or illogical interpretation of the facts or the times youve stretched the definition of a term to its breaking point.

Every single second of this episode is solid gold. Furthermore Id say that this episode is an excellent choice to introduce a newcomer to the show It doesnt have any of the big spoilers Fusions Homeworld displays a more mature Steven and invites the viewer to have some curiosity about the backstory. This really is Steven Universe at its very best.Least Favorite Garnets Universe  I get it. I get what this episode was doing. I understood all the references I understood the tropes it was parodying and I understood that it was cutesy and fun for the heck of it. But even still... I didnt enjoy it.

5282473,0,t1_cvmw32r,No but Garnet says that Steven speaks like a true king in watermelon steven if they werent trying to imply royalty a true leader would have been a better word choice and Pearl in addition to appearing to be in love with Rose was loyal to her in a way that heavily implies a class difference a knight to her liege.  But the stronger evidence is in the diamond insignias that pop up every now and again.  When something is specifically mentioned to be very old like the sky arena or the ships from friend ship the insignia has a pink diamond while for things that are implied to be newer the pyramid temple depicting some form of rebellion by a gem that looks suspiciously like Rose Quartz the hand ships floor only has three triangles with the pink one missing.  We know of one pink gem in the series who rebelled some time after coming to Earth which would cause her to be purged from the leadership.  Is it likely that Rose Quartz is this gem or that its someone else entirely.

5306217,0,t3_3nnsxl,gt We see her portrayed larger than jasper in the extended opening bue we also see steven fitting in roses hands so that could be a style choice.Unlikely and I dont quite get what you mean by a style choice. Steven isnt being held by Rose physically Id say its more of a symbolic interpretation of how she and the other Gems hold Steven to incredibly high expectations to be as good a leader as Rose was if not better.As far as the Homeworld Gems go Jasper Peridot and Lapis are all sized proportionately to one another so I see no reason why Yellow Diamond wouldnt be as well with Rebecca being a huge Invader Zim fan the Gem leadership system probably works the same way with the tallest among them being the ones calling the shots. Rose was taller than anyone as we saw in Story for Steven and then Garnetthe character seemingly made up of two Stevensized Gemsinherits the role of leader instead of say Pearl... and even on Peridots mission she wasnt hesitant to take orders from Jasper despite Jasper being clearly stated as just an escort on her mission in Cry for Help.gt She could also be wearing limb enhancers.Also unlikely unless you potentially consider high heels limb enhancers. Given what we know about Peridot now look at her in the extended intro her elbows stick far out while shes wearing her limb enhancers... but try crossing your own arms right now.

Hell of the gems weve seen who might conform to gem cultural hierarchy we dont even really know where Jasper Peridot and Lapis are in relation to each other.Of the other Gems weve seen Pearl has hangups about her social standingwhich is where we originally got the idea Garnet outright rejects the notion to the point that it doesnt really show up in her characterization beyond her feelings on Fusion in particular Rose was a radical geoterrorist and Amethyst...frankly would have no idea how Homeworld gems work at all.As of this episode weve basically learned...nothing really other than that there are multiple Peridots and theyre somewhere above pretty showpiece butler servants on the totem pole and under someone like Yellow Diamond...which was already obvious.,stevenuniverse,cvt31q9,4,t5_2viyl

5330962,0,t1_cvt1wgl,Seeing as though the Kindergarten didnt outright destroy the Earth but rather just damaged the ecosystem Id say that all the Gems need to do is learn to respect other lifeforms enough to minimise the damage on individual planets. This could be a case of spreading gem production out more carefully. It also doesnt help that the majority or at least I assume the majority of Gems made on Earth were killed during the rebellion meaning that all that environmental damage was literally for nothing. If the Gems stopped being such warmongers I can easily see Gems being able to reproduce at replacement rate all they need to do is increase lifeexpectancy and efficiency. The problem is that a society of effectivelyimmortal beings lends itself to cultural stagnation without new Gems their society simply wouldnt develop. Fair enough they dont actually need any resources so its not like they actually have to develop but this allows for mindsets eg caste systems to persist without anyone ever questioning them. A stagnant society doesnt feel the need to change things are as theyve always been. We can tell that Homeworld in its current state is not a stagnant society due to the amount of technological development that has occurred in the last few millennia. This suggests to me that Homeworld either has both a very high birth? rate and death rate or just the former and they just keep colonising when they run out of resources. ,stevenuniverse,cvt39bo,11,t5_2viyl

Also using mineral technicalities fails on account that you can look up what stones fusions are based on are  and it makes no sense in relation to other minerals fusing into those. Besides anytime you look at a website selling Pearls they almost always say stuff like Because pearls are natural organic substances they occur in a wide variety of shapes many of which are quite unique and interesting. Also most rich people dont want accessories that are identical copies to the accessories of every other rich person. That would only give more reason for Pearls to be distinct from one another.But really the only point I need to make is that we have no reason to presume Pearls are more similar than any other caste say Peridots considering Peridot says in the latest episode A Peridot with a Pearl. ,stevenuniverse,cvtkaey,2,t5_2viyl

5412263,0,t1_cw3fkz5,Well the simple answer is I said feminist women because I happen to know theres at least a dozen really good writeups of Sailor Moon on various feminist sites. I dont specifically know of any nonexplicitlyfeminist writeups on SM that are really good. Im sure there are some but I myself only know of the really good feminist ones and wanted to steer you to the ones I knew existed and were welldone.However what youre saying seems to suggest that a feminist perspective by virtue of being a specific political perspective somehow doesnt count as a varied different perspective on Sailor Moon. That if my complaint about NC is his narrow view that reading a specificallyfeminist article on SM isnt any better. But surely thats not what you meant. Surely the view of a woman exploring the whole of Sailor Moon ouvre in a long format coming from personal experience of being a girl like SM herself and dealing with similar issues not to mention a specific idelogical background is far more broad a view than some philosophicallychallenged comedian making a Youtube video about something he barely understands.On the internet I think there tends to be this idea that feminism is a monolithic thing that all feminists think alike and have the same tetchy opinions and that feminism is principally about American politics. None of that is true. If you read twenty random articles on a subject by googling you will likely read  articles by white heterosexual men. If you read twenty random specificallyfeminist articles by googling you will likely read articles by women of several ethnicities several races numerous gender and sexual identifications as well as socioeconomic backgrounds nationalities and so forth.That is to say feminist doesnt mean uppermiddleclass something American white woman who always votes Democrat. Theres a bajillion unique perspectives in feminist writings.But yeah if there were a good article on Sailor Moon by someone who wasnt specifically feminist thatd be way better than the NC video too. Though I never said anything about public opinion. Public opinion is often the mostnarrow.,stevenuniverse,cw3h595,2,t5_2viyl

5438668,0,t1_cw6s2mj,Agree with you and I also want to agree and reinforce that I dont necessarily believe that multiples of the same type of gem would be IDENTICAL. I feel like a lot of fans are interpreting it this way but it seems gems manifest how they feel individually so there must be quite a bit of leeway as to what natural forms they can take. Sure most quartz soldiers would be bulky or muscly...but I think its more of a theme that plays into the function of their class and less of a rule set. I had a discussion on here earlier about what makes Ame defective and how shes one of the only gems that is completely opposite of the metaphysical description of her stone. Notice Ame is really good at shapeshifting quickly and a variety of forms. Pearl asks her in battle to shapeshift to defeat their foe and she quickly replies I cant Im freaking out! Amethyst in metaphysical definitions enhances concentration and mental calmness. Perhaps Amethysts are astute shifters because of their mental sharpness and ability to stay calm. Our Amethyst though was overcooked and that could explain why she is the opposite of her stones properties and also says she hasnt reached her full potential until she can strengthen her mind.,stevenuniverse,cw6uddf,2,t5_2viyl

5501701,0,t1_cwevd44,Im not saying that people like that dont exist and indeed the way that so many grassroots internet movements are organized or more aptly are not definitely encourages their proliferation. What I really have a problem with is the suggestion that these people are necessarily ideological opponents social reactionaries who did this to advance the cause. Who really knows. Maybe they were just that. Maybe they were actual people who really did internalize some kind of socially conscientious viewpoint but warped by their own inner demons into something that justifies their bullying. Maybe they are just jerks with no thought to their own beliefs in which way society ought to go. The only thing that we can be totally certain of is that they are cruel people and so thats all we really have to go on. because ultimately what does it matter if it was a bunch of pseudoprogressive bullies or some kind of reactionary smear campaign. Either way the problem is that anyone can selfidentify as those things so realistically both will exist unless you argue that nobody who shares your beliefs is capable of cruelty not saying you do of course. And likewise why I think Its a conspiracy to make us look bad is something of a hollow sentiment. Anything COULD be a conspiratorial because a perfect conspiracy to fake something is by definition indistinguishable from whatever it is trying to fake so there really is no way of knowing unless you actually unmask the hypothetical conspiracy and we likewise dont have any good statistics saying that any proportion of these incidents are conspiracies. Therefore I dont really think one can make these assumptions. ,stevenuniverse,cwew6wm,2,t5_2viyl

5515202,0,t1_cwgm3vh,I dont think it has anything to do with stability of the fusion just that colour meanings have some importance in terms of personalities and how they interact with each other at times. And yes occasionally the colour scheme of a fusion.gtMy theory is that Garnet Pearl Amethyst and Ruby are all on the pinkred side of the Color wheel because they were under Pink Diamond Jasper and Peridot are under Yellow Diamond Lapis and Sapphire were under Blue Diamond.see this is what Im getting at. I feel like the colours have deeper meanings in the show. Ive also thought that each Diamond has similar coloured Gems under them. Like Lapis was probably under blue diamond. Peridot being greenyellow  blue green has more yellow than blue though was under Yellow Diamond. Moonstones and Suntsones if they exist would be under Blueor white and Yellow respectively. Each Diamond probably has some kind of role on Homeworld relating to the meanings of their colours.,stevenuniverse,cwgm8jb,1,t5_2viyl

5524740,0,t1_cwhn2a1,Theres also an important detail to consider with the murals which is that even if the figures are the diamond authority we still have a couple of unclear unknowns.  The first is the diamond thing that Rose used I cant think of anything that could be so far but its probably important and will be revealed later but the second and more important one is those little figures that are shown being tortured etc.  It is unclear whether they are gems humans robots or something else entirely.  I think that might be further indication that this is meant to be more of a depiction of this is who was here than this is what they actually looked like.  Another possibility is that the differences in hair are meant to be a kind of shorthand for movementusage of some huge power that cant be depicted visually by any means other than showing the change in the wielder. If the supposedly poofy haired gem is supposed to be shown wielding some kind of massive power which the waves underneath her might also indicate they might show that the two are connected by changing her hair.  ,stevenuniverse,cwhu2v1,1,t5_2viyl

And I feel like Gems take a long time to change if they dont put their gem to it and love is an alien nyuk nyuk concept to them so fusion for more than tactics is justunthinkable for most of them.

We dont know how important those gem shards Im secret team were so that could play into why Pearl and Amethyst were worried about Garnet finding out. Garnet has future vision so she mightve seen a future where shaking old Steven in too many birthdays actually works. It doesnt have to be interpreted as Garnet uses fear and intimidation BUT thats your interpretation and I wont judge you for it.The whole Pearl thing I can kinda get although I still like the fan art because I like dark stuff. But I gotta disagree with you on Greg. He clearly loves his son and would never harm him purposefully he just fumbles with raising him. And thats completely normal for a parent. Raising a child is extremely difficult and there isnt an official right way to do it. Parents cant always please their children thats just life. Gregs doing what he thinks is best for Steven.

5610397,0,t3_3rxxya,Rabid shipper headcanon time babes prepare yourselves Steven has somehow managed to pull off a truce with the HW with his optimism and winning dorky charm and is operating as a liaison  intermediary between Universe!Earth and HW or has at least gotten them to leave Earth alone. His reputation as the first humangem hybrid  fusion has reached far and has actually started a movement towards more humane open and accepting views among gemkind including the spread of a more tolerant approach towards fusion. Hes married Connie who is thrilled at the excitement and importance of it all. The crystal gems are still living on Earth though they probably visit visited HW at some point.  Garnet loves Steven more than ever for his tireless campaigning for tolerance and understanding. Her views on fusion being more than just a cheap war tactic and instead a significant relationship or even a way of life are slowly gaining ground among the gemkind. As a result of the fame of the crystal gems new attitudes on rank hierarchy recreational fusion and dealing with organic lifeforms are spreading. Garnet sees this as a phenomenal victory. Amethyst experienced an identity crisis and rebelling against the Crystal Gems after finding out that she would have outranked them all at HW and wondering about what else she missed  hadnt been told. After a brief HW did nothing wrong phase and going to HW to see how things are for herself she nonetheless was repulsed by HWs severely hierarchical and rigid society and tendency to look down on all the quirky and fun things organic lifeforms get around to. She managed to get quite a rep at HW with her rankdefying humour and pranks wicked antics like enjoying eating and vast knowledge of Earth pop culture and became something of a counterculture messiah  celebrity figure. She loved the attention but preferred to return to Earth with its familiarity and all the cool stuff. She loves to remind others of how shes badass famous as Amethyst Earthchild in HW. She sometimes travels with Peridot and even once with Peridot and Pearl though their combined antics got on Pearls nerves so much itll take a few hundred years before the next trip together. Pearl has finally grown to be her own gem and has moved on from her fanatically adoring devotion to her former owner Rose Quartz. Shes moved on to a different big strong gem to fuse and experience glorious battle victories with  Jasper. They spend a lot of time off Earth traveling the galaxy and discussing the past since both feel a little constricted if they stay on Earth too long but theyre around most of the time. Peridot lost her position with HW after willfully collaborating with the CG lifethreatening apocalyptic situation or no and actually was herself a little disillusioned after realising they hadnt sent anyone after her or her team. Shes content to remain on Earth where her position among the CG is markedly better than her lowly rank at HW. Or at least thats what she tells herself. She discusses and invents gemtech stuff with Pearl a lot the two having built a friendship over mutual passion for technology and organising and gets into wild shenanigans with Amethyst. Shes found she has knack for designing funfair rides and has struck up a lucrative deal with Mr. Smiley coincidentally also boosting Beach Citys economy. She loves to flaunt her connection and position as Amethysts almostascool personal friend at HWaffiliated planets. Lapis spends a lot of time alone contemplating and resting. After having grown disillusioned with HW and feeling out of place there after her millennialong incarceration shes found that being alone feels comfortable to her. Shes around the ocean floor a lot and sometimes flies around space but shows up regularly to hang out with Steven. Her relationship with the rest of the CGs is still a little fraught. Her relationship with Jasper is absolutely glacial. Jasper got severe PTSD from the whole Malachite incident and went after Steven big time blaming Rose and her filthy rebels for having orchestrated it all through her sick and twisted fusion organic regeneration abomination seeing fusion as wicked and immoral. The CG managed to beat her and combined with facing the cluster together she eventually agreed to very grudgingly work together with the rest of the CG to avoid destruction on this miserable planet. During those interactions she slowly started to see the points and motivations behind the CGs views as well as was impressed with their determination and battle tactics. In particular she connected with Pearl over their mutual zeal for warriors honour code battle glory ideals and admiration for Rose as well as feeling alienated on Earth and reminiscing over war memories from the Rebellion. The way Pearl has transcended her creation position and function and through her own efforts has become something more even a decent warrior despite having not been built for fighting impressed her though it took her a long time to admit that even to herself  as did Pearls unwavering loyalty and gusto and respect for rules.  Eventually she had to fight together and even fuse which was at first somewhat traumatic. She finally agreed to fuse with Pearl believing her to be so weak it would be impossible for the Malachite scenario to repeat itself. The resulting fusion combining crushing force with elegant swift grace and cutting arrogant sass obviously was a triumph and prodded Jasper further into introspection and rethinking her views. Eventually she followed Peridots example and got officially nonhostile even friendly with the CG though this betrayal of HW had her questioning her very self. Im assuming theres some heavy disillusionment on HW and their motives and tactics and stuff they pulled too. Naturally she also lost her position at HW and remains on Earth traveling occasionally with Pearl and being an awesome older sister training influence on Amethyst who admires her greatly.Occasionally on their travels some hapless gem refers to Pearl as her pearl or tries to order Pearl about in the wrong tone. She pounds them to the ground.Sheesh it got long Im sorry! I guess you can tell which gems I like and who I ship heheh,stevenuniverse,cwsivh1,9,t5_2viyl

Ruby chugs fireball from the bottle starts a fight with Jasper and then passes out on top of the washing machine.Jasper finds a beer funnel hat in Amethysts room and decides to try to drink more than everyone else but she turns out to be an hilarious lightweight. She spends most of the party lying prone on the beach proclaiming her love to anything that walks into her field of vision. Mostly seagulls.Lapis ignores everyone and watches Crying Breakfast Friends with a bottle of UV Blue until Ruby spills a beer into one of her water wings. Then she sits angrily on the bottom of the ocean for a while. Eventually the tide comes in Jasper gets washed out to sea and Lapis has to fling her back up on the beach.Peridot has a few too many shots of Midori and spends most of the party following Amethyst around obviously staring at her butt and blushing furiously. Amethyst doesnt mind.Amethyst drinks rubbing alcohol and the gas out of Gregs van but forgot to shapeshift a liverintestines so she just does it for the flavor. Later on she and Greg stealthily smoke a joint in the bathroom and watch a bunch of Crying Breakfast Friends episodes. They still dont get it.Pearl finds a lovely pink wine and is having a wonderful time then she reads the bottle... its a Ros. She immediately becomes weepy wine mom. Everyone dogpile hugs her until she stops sniffling and she spends the rest of the night cleaning up spilled drinks and putting blankets over sleeping Gems.Connie isnt  yet and at first she says shes not going to drink but she ends up doing a couple shots with Peridot. They start playing video games and get extremely competitive. Pearl has to ask them to stop using such foul language.Steven cracks a beer with his dad jams out on ukulele and hangs out with everybody because of course he does.

After that in Steven and the Stevens Steven demonstrates that he can play the drums and the guitar and possibly also bass I cant tell the difference between guitars and bass.All of that means that at around the ages of  Steven can sing compose and play the ukulele drums and guitar and maybe bass.

Everybody would know what gems are. And if then Id find out that there are a couple of survivors of that race living on a beach right next to a town and not exactly hiding these gems would be famous. That there used to be a fence is no excuse. The people of Beach City should at the very least know about the temple. Yet the Pizza family has never even been to that side of the beach? What?

They go deep with the lore.gtThis show is going to be a wild ride I know that.You dont even know.gtLASER LIGHT CANNONThis episode is ruined for me after someone made this fucking thing.gt There also appears to be the triforce hidden inside it. No kidding is that just a Zelda reference or does that have some signifigance?Never noticed that. Can be a reference since they fill this show with Nintendo references.gt So Steven is basically his mom reincarnated but halfhuman if I understood that right.Yeah pretty much although its important to note that he is not his mom.gtIs that a super mushroom?Yep Nintendo references.gtGreat episode and I cant wait for more.A lot of people dont care about these first episodes.

5769815,0,t1_cxc8sjx,Yeah.  Thats where Im kind of unsure why we are supposed to think highly of Greg as a good guy.  There are only five or four depending how you look at Garnet Gems left on Earth to protect Earth from the Gem monsters and homeworld.  Only ONE of those Gems was actually charmed by humans.  Ruby and Sapphire dont care either way  as long as they get to be fused.  Amethyst is a little bit ticked off already about being considered bad because of how she was born  and can hardly be bothered to not use her powers on humans out of formless anger and being the bad thing that the Gems were fighting to save the good humans from.  Pearl only cares for what Rose wants  and Rose is charmed by humans.  So Greg swoops in and does everything in his power to alienate Pearl and punish her for having made the wrong choice to save Earth to please Rose and then kills off Rose.  That isnt a very effective use of charm.  When the show starts we know that all of the Gems kind of resent Greg.  And in petty ways we want to defend him and make them respect his human frailty and desires.  But in terms of considering the actual situation with humanitys chances in a battle against Gems without guardians who are actually committed to do all the fighting for humanity  Greg is like the worst most embarrassing nincompoop.  Even now he is gloating over breaking Pearl emotionally  as if doing that and killing Rose was a splendid idea and very helpful to everyone.  Throw in a familiar sort of contempt for Amethyst  who is borderline psychotic by her innate warrior nature I guess  and he seems like the worst human possible.  We have Connie actually saying that as a human SHE wants to fight for Earth which isnt much but is enough to put stars in Pearls eyes.  Like WTF was Gregs plan in terms of representing humanity in a heroic and worthwhile way?Steven was Roses plan.  But what did Greg think he was adding to Earths chances? What does he seriously think he is doing to help now?  Its funny and it is petty enough to feel real and human  but damn.,stevenuniverse,cxcas0z,0,t5_2viyl

Not sure of the topics but Peridot is the  candidate to appear in one then probably  Lapis and finally Japser. Hopefully well finally get to see one with a healed Centapeetle. Hmm lets see which each gems topic would be.PeridotWhat is the Gem Homeworld or The Cluster or Gem TechLapis Gem Warmaybe with Jasper or Warping since she was found at the galaxy warp and allJasper Gem War maybe with Lapis Yellow DiamondAlternatively Gem war could be Garnet and Pearl their side vs Jasper and Lapis their side aka homeworlds side ,stevenuniverse,cxtv1qr,30,t5_2viyl
5913183,0,t3_3w8v3m,I Have a theory around Peridot. Mostly based on when she kept saying I havent cracked and how shes handling Earth so far. I think in the near future we are gonna see her get hurt and crack REALLY bad. Like Amethyst level bad . This is going to cause Steven to have faith in himself and regain his healing powers to save her. After shes recovered he and the gems are going to give Peridot the option to return home on the warp pad Steven will fix with his spit. This is where the theory splits however. She MIGHT go home. She obviously still wants to though if she bonds with the gems enough she may be like Naw Homeworld has enough Peridots. They wont miss one which would be cool ,stevenuniverse,cxur1dz,4,t5_2viyl

She set Stevens life in motion  and threw in some MAJOR obstacles via her own actions that make her intent and influence more important than almost anyone else in the story.  Because she is dead  she doesnt get the option for redemption or learning how she was wrong.  She doesnt have the opportunity Darth Vader or Voldemort had to make her case or be redeemed.If it turns out that she was not righteous in her decision to make Earth her battleground for slaughtering and maiming countless Gems  then she is a baddie.  Having set Steven up to clean up her mess wont change things because Steven gets to claim his good acts as his own.  If she did her horrible acts for grey reasons all of her redemption ends up being Stevens achievement because she bailed and she will end up being a genuinely magnificent arch villain.She lost her wiggle room when she made Steven.I am actually hoping that she will be a goodie in spite of what a great bad guy she would make BECAUSE they promised not to have a big villain.  But she would be a HUGE wikipedia entry bad guy character if they did decide to make her enemies into hapless victims.   She is on the verge of being an amazingly awful monster and the reveal of perfect Rose being worse than Voldemort rather than just having a few thorns would be pretty impressive.,stevenuniverse,cxzu6zs,2,t5_2viyl

I never understood why Lapis is paired with them. Shes not really a homeworld gem. Sure she came from homeworld but only in the same sense that the Pearl Ruby Sapphire and Rose also came from homeworld originally. Lapis has been trapped in the mirror for thousands of years maybe even from before the war. She went back to homeworld and said it was different and she was even held prisoner by JasperPeridot. If anything Lapis should be her own separate group. She doesnt side with the CGs OR Homeworld gems. At most she sides with Steven and thats it.Though it IS fanart and it can be drawn any way people want. It just seems a bit odd that most of the fandom seems to have agreed that Lapis fits in with Jasper and Peridot despite that being the exact opposite of what happened in the show.,stevenuniverse,cy0u3ry,1,t5_2viyl

5984271,0,t1_cy4248y,She was described that way.  But Greg especially has revealed her to be less than empathetic and kind and brilliant and loving.  She is jolly and infatuated in Story for Steven and kind of suggestively fun in We Need to Talk before he has the big scene where he pretty much describes her as an inconsiderate and arrogant person who did not even realize how little she knew about love or how little she cared about the people she had played with before Greg.  His depiction of Rose as someone who is kinda dumb is not consistent with the idea that she was a brilliant leader who understood even the simplest of emotional experiences or the motivational effect she actually had on people and Gems.  Very briefly he outed her as ignorant and unkind  a diamond in the rough who HE had to turn into a nice person  rather than a sophisticated intelligent and caring person who had fought to save humanity because she cared.Also Pearl does not describe Rose in anything but glowing terms  but when she shows Steven cool things about Rose the picture she inadvertently paints is a very frightening one.  And example of this is in Roses Scabbard in the armory when giving the lady with the dealies her proper name of Heretics Anguish Pearl verifies the previous suspicion a viewer might have that the thing is actually a torture device for nonbelievers.  Rose kept that handy.  Thats a little bit scary.,stevenuniverse,cy42ied,4,t5_2viyl

Connie didnt understand her mother because shes a child and children dont understand their parents because they arent mature enough.  Dr. Maheswaran forgave her daughter instantly because of something called empathy she put herself in the place of her daughter inside her mind and realized her flaws as a parent she cant blame Connie because she made her daughter lie to her by being obtuse.  ,stevenuniverse,cyiakud,1,t5_2viyl

No matter the rotation pink should always be across from white and yellow across from blue.  Thats been established.I was pointing out that in most of the scenes in the first room they mix up the positions of the diamonds.  Theres a scene or two where pink is in front of the door and white is directly across the room correct orientation but most of them have yellow across from pink for some reason not the correct orientation as you pointed out.  For example yellow should not be adjacent to blue and across from pink but appears as such for most views of the floor.  If you look at the pictures I listed the first one is the orientation you pointed out the error the second one is the different correct position and the third is another view of the error.What Im trying to say is that yes the floor is mostly consistent but most of the views are in consistent error.

Which would have been when she was a homeworld Pearl based on her realization that she could build a space vessel.Think about this timeline for a bitAt one point we know Pearl was loyal to Pink Diamond and apparently doesnt feel bad about that now. We know that by the beginning of the rebellion Pearl was Roses because of the conversation in Roses Scabbard. my Pearl Rose telling her Pearl doesnt have to do this with her as if shes a close friendIf PD is Rose this makes perfect sense but if not when did the transfer happen and why does Pearl still wear a PD spacesuit with apparently no regrets when she never otherwise mentions her and is completely loyal to Rose? Its got to be a shapeshifted suit so why not just change the insignia on the suit if it matters to her at all?gtSo is Jasper. So was garnet. So is Purple Puma.Rose is actually bigger than all these people also Purple Puma is a point for height not mattering meaning the only really solid piece of counterevidence goes away.gtGems determine behavioral patterns? Peridemption arc disproves that.No but they do determine powers and Rose has healing powers an entirely defensive weapon and life magic.

6223848,0,t1_cywy88p,Well as I said its all based in the artists representation of the event. Rose holds her hand out the same way weve seen Steven do it to summon the shield arms stretched out palms out and hands pointed up. The shield itself is a projection from the user. Also the Gem opposing Rose has diamonds floating around their feet and what is arguably a water spout underneath them. And the end of the Rebellion does not mean the end of Homeworlds presence on Earth though they probably were not the ones to build it if the Gem inside was a homeworld Gem. It could have been Crystal Gems that died between the end of the Rebellion and the s when we see the CGs for the first time it could have also been humans that built it around the already existing construct.As much as the mural is a good piece of background information I myself am beginning to question its legitimacy as its VERY early show.

Look what that got her in front of the handship. She got shanked and locked up.Now compare that to how she fights in Stronger Than You. Shes evasive nimble tricky even. In fact it isnt until shes able to disarm Jasper that she even tries to land a hit. All her strikes from before were to make Jasper over extend. Which happens at about  seconds in then she changes how shes fighting again. Now shes no longer moving.Its very very remniscent of the Final Agni Kai  in ATLA. Compare it to this scene  which is his much more traditional style even if it comes from much later in the series. See the parallels? Hell Even Jasper and Azula parallel here. Katara is the reactor here. That scene there is filled with the kind of sound design we like. Notice how Zukos firebending sounds real as opposed to Azulas butane sounding flame.

Passion  We want to fuse for the joy of it.             Tempo  Syncing your bodies makes syncing your mind easier.

6432780,0,t3_43spww,I think Lapis is special. No other gem has been shown to be able to fly without relying on shapeshifting or artificial means such as limb enhancers. Though Peridots enhancers didnt seem to have the strength to get her back to Homeworld. And as Peridot told us shapeshifting takes far too much energy for its output. That doesnt mean that Lapis is the only gem that can fly through space just that most cant. Galaxy Warps seem to allow individual gems to travel between different worlds without using ships. I dont think its either a novelty or a relic. I think Homeworld still uses them quite frequently. Also Id like to mention that Lapis may not have flown all the way back to Homeworld. She may have flown to the nearest warp pad and warped from there. The extended intro does have a scene of what appears to be Steven and the gems warping from somewhere offEarth. ,stevenuniverse,czkorki,7,t5_2viyl

Part of the malachite fusion is obviously mental gymnastics to get revenge but she also cares a lot about Steven. I imagine she will very lighthearted and jokey when she isnt going through all that emotional turmoil. She will definitely start out very distanced from everyone other then Steven. Then she will probably cooperate with them but still very opposed to being around them. Eventually there will be some kind of sacrifice done for her like Garnet diving to take a bullet for her scenario. I dont see her gently easing her way into the group like Peridot did.

6542902,0,t1_czw2kfj,gt This is my first time posting on this subHey hey welcome! And I think your point here is bang on. Amethysts a child of two cultures. Shes been raised as a Gem albeit by Gems rejecting traditional Gem culture but on a planet teeming with humans. The Earth is everything shes ever known. Why would she feel a connection to Gem culture like Pearl does? No matter how much Pearl might like her to it aint her thing. No she cant quite entirely relate to them with their Gem roots. Earth sets her apart.Amethysts a curious rebellious type. She loves emulating humanity trying human things out for herself eating sleeping all that. She runs away from the Gems at night for wrestling and in that human culture she feels like shes loved that she fits in. In the extended intro her I will fight sequence goes from the Kindergarten to the wrestling ring. Thats her cultural progression. Greg comes along a wellmeaning human becoming a big part of their life and hes all over how new and exciting he is. But Gregs not so much the adventurous type. Vidalia on the other hand? Now thats a gloriously explosive combination. They mustve raised hell.,stevenuniverse,czw37x8,9,t5_2viyl

As far as I know it hasnt been outlawed but it isnt OTC.You might be thinking of DXM which is a regular cough suppressant that you find in Robitussin and the like which I and miscreants like me used to chug bottles of cough syrup to get high on. This was like  years ago though and IIRC they were starting to crack down on the practice around the time I was old and savvy enough to know where to find better drugs. I think they started adding other chemicals that would make you barf if you took too much. I mean a lot of people barfed just because drinking a bottle of cough syrup is not very pleasant but the additives like basically guarantee a trip to the vomitorium.Anyway kids dont drink cough syrup. ,stevenuniverse,czyfbcb,3,t5_2viyl

The Last Airbender movie was hated by almost everyone.Honestly I didnt hate it as much as other people seem to. People miss the fact that as crap as the movie was they did some of the scenes pretty accurately to the show like Katara accidentally freezing Sokka. Another complaint people have is that they skipped things from the show. Ok explain. How does anyone expect them to fit an entire season worth of  minute tv shows into a single hour and a half movie without skipping or glossing over things?

When you can live forever and your civilization spans galaxies things like stars dying or galaxies merging would have to actually be on your radar.Why gems feel the need to colonize is certainly still a mystery so far. I mean it could be just that like any lifeform they have a need to reproduce and expand their numbers just cause thats what all living things like to do. Or something made them for the express purpose of keeping the universal fishtank clean of organic life. All signs definitely seem to point to them needing living planets for reproduction and perhaps those are relatively rare compared to other sorts of planets?gtIf true this would give us an unsettling explanation as to why a species that disdains organic life would have gems like Rose with the power to control plants...one of their duties might be stripping planets of unwanted organic matter hijacking the biosphere and using it against itself.Lapis would be really handy too.

Before Steven there was nobody to stop them from violencing their way through any problems.And then BAM heres Steven always ready to talk with anyone about their issues. What ifTM Steven never went up to Peridot in the Kindergarten? What was Garnets plan? What would be Garnets plan? How to destroy the control room without showing themselves to Peridot? Or hide until she decides to leave?And also none of the Crystal Gems were made to be talkative. Amethyst is outright a warrior gem. Pearls were made to obey their masters and never have thoughtsinitiative of their own. Garnet is made of a warrior gem remember the other two Rubies? and a seer gem thats detached from the present.

6810025,0,t3_48yl3p,Pearl is so wonderful probably the most interesting and inspiring character for me. She isnt necessarily a character you love but one which is very absorbing. and I want to know her backstory and what the few thousand years were like before she met Rose because its going to be so important. Its been referenced so many times like Garnet and her being a fusion and the general importance of fusion. Its clear that Pearl is still battling with some very heavy indoctrination Im just a pearl..I need someone to tell me what to do even  years after she rebelled. Its gonna be so important to see that episode when they reveal how that happened to her motherofpearl is a real life gem...maybe thatll have something to do with it. Shes also probably the most powerful gem on the show. Not because shes physically strong but because when she believes in herself she can do anything take down Sugilite for example. Shes like the incarnation of the idea that you can go beyond what others have destined for you to be that hard work always wins and being strong in the real way doesnt mean physical strength.Pearl is the much needed counter balance to all the crazy magic power stuff going on because it makes it not about who has the best weapon does that need to be discussed? that needs to be discussed. my vote is amethysts dope whip but about emotional and mental strength being more important.,stevenuniverse,d0o7oqf,4,t5_2viyl

Most people in here arent worried about cancellation over SUs content theyre just annoyed.And obviously CN has their reasons and a lot of their shows work this way but this scheduling still is a massive pain in the ass for us little people. Especially when the traditional expectation for US TV shows is a odd episode season that lasts from something like September to May so the feeling that a show should air that way is kinda hard to shake. And even when SU was airing weekly for a while there at the end of last year they kept messing with the time slot.From a fans perspective I think being in the total dark about when a show is coming back along with enduring two prolonged hiatuses in a row is worth getting just a bit salty over.

6853177,0,t1_d0t38rt,Fighting can lead to death yes but it also can lead to life. That would be the very point of a protector. Also all of her abilities do not involve healing. Her abilities all involve protection. A shield. A Barrier. Sentient Plants that can be used to defend positions. The size and strength to stand against foes. All of it goes back to protection not medicine.It really didnt. Especially as we arent talking about past reasons or attachments. We are talking their then system of governance and perhaps what might still be it to this day. That is a challenge to social hierarchy and cultural norms that are literally the basis of their society as a whole so yeah kinda not a valid example if that is the way youre using it.It is an assumption because youre assuming its social. Because again were looking at it from a human perspective without any context. People have been theory crafting for sometime now that the different diamonds have different dominions within gem culture and while that is still a theory we do know for a fact that Sapphire was a diplomatso diplomat belongs to Blue Biamonds court warrior Rubies not so much. So yeah it is assumption because were not sure why that angers her beyond speculation. And she definitely didnt expand upon her rage beyond that it was an obviously broken taboo.Again they arent races not in the ethnic sense and when we have literal powers associate with gem types that farther diverges it from trying to draw that parallel. They do have a harsh caste system but that system isnt race based at all it is function based. It would be like taking a tank and trying to use it as a Zamboni if were being honest. No gems arent machine and are sentient but sentience doesnt immediately tie it to the parallel youre making.  I mean you must not be familiar with the monarchy system then. Was it racism then I mean because bloodlines did determine job possibilities and people were forced into roles based on their innate abilities. The point there is that maybe we could stop pretending that the caste system is anything other than simply a caste system. It isnt race based at least not for gems because again gem types are closer to species than they are to the ethnicity that we humans enjoy. Is the idea of the caste system bad to us the product of a post democracy ruled world? Yes but continuing to tout it as racism is still incorrect.,stevenuniverse,d0t46lk,1,t5_2viyl
6853444,0,t1_d0t4gml,So you think all fat people should think theyre lessthan? What about a fat kid who sees somebody fat on TV and thinks you can be a hard working warrior goddess and still be fat and gets into the hard working warrior part of that and coincidentally loses weight?This isnt an issue thats about peoples health. This is an issue to do with fat people being seen and treated as actual human fucking being worthy of respect. There HAVE been plenty of portrayals of meth addicts who are wellrounded characters most recent obvious example being Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad. Trying to engender empathy towards people who are different from you is not the same as saying hey kids never exercise and dont worry about eating right.I hate actually debating stuff on this dumb site. It gets me crazyanxious so Im probably just going to leave it here. But suffice it to say all I think this show is doing by having positive characters who are fat and even if Rose isnt other characters definitely are is communicating to children being fat doesnt mean you cant be active or arent a good person. At most. At least it is just communicating some people in the world are fat. Its NEVER saying that being fat is good or that people shouldnt try to be healthy.

6875673,0,t3_49humj,The appearance of gems are not only based on their type but also the place they were made like how certain mineral species are unique to specific locations so gems of the same type wont necessarily look the same. The three identical rubies we see in The Answer were all from the same kindergarten and therefore looked identical but rubies from a different kindergarten would have looked different.

7046683,0,t1_d1f39tl,gt Not quite. When a character in a story is taken on a great journey and learns something from it do they forget everything once they come home by the end of the story? Nope everything they learned along is still there. Even if the conflict that caused them to learn that thing is no longer relevant its still learnt.That doesnt really change that its a complete storywriting copout. Its not only not interesting its not what a lot of people want. Roses sacrifice doesnt really mean anything at all if she can come back. The impact is gone. All the strife these characters have been through  pointless. I could argue with you to the death over how this would simply be bad writing. A key part of writing an interesting plot is to keep your emotional impacts relevant and important. A sacrifice should stay sacrificed. A dead character should stay dead etc etc. If you write off your own plot it gets convoluted it gets boring it loses impact.Suddenly you find people dont care about your characters anymore. Maybe people think youre incapable of writing in actual consequences. Its a pretty fundamental rule of good writing. Especially for a emotionfocused show on Steven Universe. You have to make every emotion matter. And when people look back on the things that made them feel sadness or happiness those things still must be able to cause those emotions. They have to be relevant. And then theres the matter of just... standards for writing. Setting aside any effects this would have on the story I hate lazy writing with a passion. They need to WORK to make a good story. The rose comes back idea requires about the same level of storywriting expertise as a  year old to come up with. I expect... quality at the least. I want thought. I want interesting. Not... fanfiction at best. Its why Dragon Ball Z pissed me off so much. They kept writing off important parts of the story. There was no emotional impact in anything throughout that entire show for the exact reason we are debating. Characters. Came. Back. ,stevenuniverse,d1f3l92,1,t5_2viyl

A better example is the Devil where upright it means you are simply focusing on the material world because you need to right now like focusing on the starting of a new business while reversed it could mean you are focusing on the physical world as an escape from mental anguish which should be dealt with.  ,stevenuniverse,d1gwl5j,2,t5_2viyl

No matter what the gender demographic is Steven Universe is aimed at teens and young adults.Just because its appropriate for children and can be liked by children doesnt mean that its meant exclusively for children.Steven Universe is undeniably a show that children will watch at a young age grow up find people talking about on an online forum rewatch on Hulu or something and then realize that the show was a lot deeper and much better than they really understood when they were little.In a way I think its safe to say that the true demographic doesnt exist yet or at the very least is still on their way to becoming the true demographic.Im rambling but I tend to ramble when I get interested in things.,stevenuniverse,d1xxs5z,3,t5_2viyl

The nature of her loyalties pining for her old life ambivalence towards Earth and its inhabitants and emotional issues have been set up too carefully for me to believe otherwise.  The whole Sardonyx arc already pushed her more towards being her own Gem meaning shes going to have an easier time going against the wishes of Rose and the other Crystal Gems under the right circumstances.

Superman is the son of Zod The Waynes stay in during the fateful night and Batman is Kirk Langstrom who in the main series is Manbat and Diana never left the island and Wonder Woman is instead a New God from New Genesis. I highly recommend watching the movie if you were a fan of Justice League or Justice League Unlimited same creative team.TLDR The point is What if there was a small altercation in how events happened that resulted in a butterfly effect of seemingly trivial events or characters taking the spotlight.

7437178,0,t1_d2j7t9w,Im late to this reply been away from Reddit a few days but regardless Id like to point out that explaining it away like this only opens up more contradiction.Lets go on the basis that they censored this purely because of the sensual dancing. Yknow regardless of the heterosexual sensual dancing later on ending in a dip and kiss an all. But yeah. Lets go on that  already shaky  basis.Now... it has to be said Steven Universe kinda has a track record of sensual dancing. Like this And infamously this. One of these came a while before the other only shortly after but you know what neither of them are? Censored in the UK.So why is Pearl and Roses dance censored while none of the others are? What sets them apart in that particular episode? And Id just like to point out that this happens to be the episode that once and for all quashed the claims that Pearls feelings for Rose couldve been platonic  in that episode her romantic jealousy was shown clearly enough that even the most vocal of dissenters had to accept it.In that case in the absence of any other differences and Id say that the other two dances pointed out have the censored one beat on suggestiveness I think it seems a pretty safe claim to say that the romantic feelings suggested is what edged it out.Funny that.,stevenuniverse,d2nk53m,1,t5_2viyl

7460366,0,t3_4hh2li,Pearls my least favorite character with Lars and Sadie also being pretty high up there. I cant really stand Connies parents either.Ive stated my reasons for hating Pearl before I find her obnoxious and cant believe that shes allowed to be alone around Steven and Connie after all the things shes done. I get having a flawed character but having one who brainwashed a child and made her think she was worthless? Allowing the son of your dead former lover to potentially drop to his death? Kidnapping that boy and taking him into outer space where he could almost get killed because of your selfishness? It just bothers me that she always gets off with a slap on the wrist for this kind of stuff and were supposed to be okay with it because muh tragic backstory. If you want to be blunt shes an awful horrible person. Plus she needs to get over Rose her desire to project her feelings onto others has done a lot to hurt Steven and Connie.For Lars and Sadie I think theyre horrible in their own ways. Lars is an out and out douchebag who never learns his lesson and continues to be a tryhard prick with absolutely zero redeeming qualities. Sadie however is just as bad if not worse due to doing some downright awful things to Lars like contaminating his food with a lethal substance that could have killed him over pettiness or kidnapping him and Steven and stranding them on a remote island for weeks with a dangerous monster because she wanted some Lars booty. And yet were supposed to sympathize with her. Ugh. Plus theyre both boring and I dont find them compelling in the slightest.And as for the Maheswarans to put it bluntly theyre also pretty unbearable. Theyre smug elitists rude to just about everyone abusive and just all around shitty parents. Connie deserves better.,stevenuniverse,d2q73tv,1,t5_2viyl

7477813,0,t3_4htc5n,I love the way Amethysts rebellion is treated as something she needs  the episode Tiger Millionaire in particular shows how she feels so restricted by the Gems and needs space to do what she likes even if the others disapprove. Real depth and understanding to it.But regarding your example... thats a tricky one. Weve got those but weve also got Rose Quartzs sacrifice for Steven. She had to die in order to bring him into being and though thats new life its also the destruction of old life  willingly removing the Crystal Gems lynchpin and throwing them into disarray for the time being. Is it worth it in the end? Steven is capable of things that Rose wasnt and is a physical bridge over the humanGem gap in a way thats never existed previously. Pearl in particular may never have managed to stand alone otherwise. But do the ends justify the means and all the suffering that Roses choice put them through?Whenever weve seen what Rose did in terms of it being a choice she made its been treated as you describe it  a sacrifice despite it being quite literally selfdestructive. Lion  its purely romanticised making the ultimate sacrifice in having a child for she so loved the world she gave her only son  its like shes a Holy Trinity of God Jesus and Mary. So yeah   though I have faith that the show will eventually come to portray it from another angle at the moment Roses part in it is treated universally as a positive when it really wasnt.Ive been writing a big post examining that in great detail over the past few months but god dammit it got wiped with my phone along with a hell of a lot of other stuff recently so I guess this is the best I can give for the time being,stevenuniverse,d2s6nh1,52,t5_2viyl

7485839,0,t3_4hwwdn,As Ive mentioned in another thread this is available on JB HiFis website where its on sale along with all other DVDsBDs until the th of May. For me in the U.S. it comes to . after shipping and GST Global Sales Tax. Thats  cheaper than what you would pay before tax and shipping on Madmans site.Its also worth mentioning that for a few bucks cheaper there is a DVD set for those of you who arent picky about format.And as I also mentioned in the other thread you can preorder another Madman release a Bluray edition of Over the Garden Wall something thats currently unavailable in the United States dang CN get it together. It comes out on the th of June and the product description lists it as having all the special features of the DVD release we got in the States.All of these are Region  DVDRegion B Bluray which means they wont run on most American DVDBD players. However theres DVDFab Passkey Lite free software which will allow you to bypass encryptions and region locks on your DVDs and Blurays. Also depending on your Bluray drive it should allow you to watch Blurays on your PC with media players other than CyberLink PowerDVD the worst media player in the world. VLC is a commonly recommended alternative.I say depending on your Bluray drive because a buddy and I use the same software but different drives  he cant play newer BD releases whereas Ive had no problems thus far.,stevenuniverse,d2t3kv5,14,t5_2viyl

I enjoyed it but disliked that everything else i.e. Malachite Greg Lion etc. kinda took a back seat. I think the only other character who did really get any time during that was Connie and that was because she had Nightmare Hospital which was basically right before Peridemption began and Stevens Birthday right before the finale of Peridemption.I kind of thought having both Lapis and Jasper staying at the same time would be a synergistic effect where it would be better than just one arc of Lapis and one arc of Jasper.Though Im just as excited for this especially to see some teamwork not just between the CGs but also with Lapis.,stevenuniverse,d2wy2y9,3,t5_2viyl

7609013,0,t3_4jia49,So Ive actually posted in different threads about theories like this before and I think you may be onto something. The left panel definitely looks like the scene with the cluster and the gem within it looks a bit like Peridot.The center panel is what the theory hinges on the most I think. Ive also postulated that Rose in this case is a metaphor for Steven but I think the panel depicts something thats already happened...the events of Ocean Gem. Look at it Rose is facing off against a blue gem on a tower of something that resembles water. The moon above...the stars alight...and below them the indistinct figures of the CGs Greg Connie and the water clones?Who knows...if this theory is right then that means were due the panel on the right sometime in the future and honestly I dont think it looks like yellow diamond...I think it looks a bit like Jasper in her helmet.Well just have to see.,stevenuniverse,d373t2r,2,t5_2viyl

Plus wed get to see more of how the gems are when Stevens not around which would have been cool.

Jasper locked her up because Lapis withheld important information. Jasper was shocked that Lapis had done so. In other words Jasper considered Lapis to be a loyal Homeworld gem.

Very likely something to do with her being in the mirror.B Now most of this is theory due to the just HOW long were the timelines. But it could also be very likely they havent been bubbling gems the WHOLE time and one of the stronger theories is Rose could be the subdued corrupted gems at peace die. Most of this comes from a few hints and rough counts from how many gems have been bubbled in their storage room how many gems they seem to be bubbling and given HOW LONG it has been since the war. It could be very well they started bubbling after Rose pass as a way to contain it and hope Steven finds a way to continue what Rose did.,stevenuniverse,d3cad47,2,t5_2viyl

7657436,0,t1_d3c9cs8,Ive seen a few people complaining about the lack of mystery over Lapiss entrapment but if anything this episode has opened up a new Lapis mystery what was she even doing on Earth in the first place for such a long time that she was unable to escape the war zone?I feel like Lapis is deliberately keeping something out of her literal backstory. It ties up far too neatly and her reactions to the Crystal Gems are still so pointed and specific the extreme close up of her face the wrinkle of her nose and eyes that they dont match up with someone who knows Homeworld was behind her situation. Lapis may be extrapolating the blame of her circumstance back to the source but its really hard to believe she doesnt have any animosity reserved for the Gems whom actually trapped her and used her. Either Lapis is a Homeworld apologist or shes hiding something to make herself look as victimised as possible.After all Sugar has told us Lapis can be manipulative and we see hints of that at the end of the episode with her immediately implicating Steven in her rights to the barn.,stevenuniverse,d3clvya,2,t5_2viyl

7658661,0,t1_d3ckg0a,Theyre similar though the Mennonites are sane in that they dont arbitrarily decide that technology is bad theyre really just regular christian people who tend to dress modestly and behave themselves.  And they ALSO dont have that ridiculously hypocritical Amish rule that you can have any Tech you want in your BARN but not in your HOUSE... so you can just fill your barn with treadmills and big screen TVs and other shit and cheat.There are Old Type Amish who do the whole horse and buggy thing and New Type Amish who are closer to the Mennonites.But in my three experiences with the Amish yeah theyve been really mean awful people.  Once we were a bit lost and my Stepdad pulled over to check the map on the side of a road.  An Amish guy who was there came over in less than  seconds and was like You cant stay here!  Stepdad said Yeah okay Im just checking my map.  Amish guy says again You cant stay here!  Again Okay I just need to see where we are.  As he then said a third time You cant stay here! we just rolled up our windows and ignored the man.  The other times were the same sort of short tempered arrogant unfriendliness too.Dont get me wrong theres some good Amish out there.  One of my familys friends grew up Amish and hes one of the best people Ive ever met... but at the same time hes not Amish anymore and now runs a multimillion dollar metalworking business.  It just seems to me that theres a real culture of scorning outsiders there and anyone decent enough to realize that is also smart enough to realize that adding extra steps and hardships to your life does absolutely NOTHING to add to your morality especially in a Christian context as if youd just open that book there youd be like Oh gee Jesus never ever told anyone to give up convenience because he was more interested in saying things like Neither do I condemn you go now and sin no more.  Huh.Also side note Im pretty sure that the Amish as a subculture have the highest incidence percentages of child molestation and incest.  Might have dipped in recent years as I saw this in a documentary years ago but yeah thats what I was told.  All in all terrible people.BONUS  No Amish will get in my face over this!  Its on the INTERNET!  Unless theyre in their Cheater Barns.  In which case well I call Hypocrisy.,stevenuniverse,d3cqvp8,2,t5_2viyl

Although I think Amethysts should be a little higher and Stevens a little lower. And one thing Id like to note while Pearl is easily the weakest gem objectively she could still kick Amethysts butt. She got skills. Remember Steven the Swordfighter?Also as for the question fusion. Definitely fusion.Also the next batch of episodes is the beginning of what I like to call Steven Universe . where the show begins to take a more serious turn.

7752422,0,t1_d3nbr61,Youre exaggerating what actually happened.  Solitary confinement is a technique that puts someone completely alone with no social contact for long periods of time.  What happened to Lapis in the mirror was solitary confinement.  Its not Lapis sitting in a cell being questioned because she lied about something important to the mission.  Yeah I definitely agree that being imprisoned again even for a short time would be a horrible experience for Lapis after getting out of the mirror.  It would have more meaning for her than another person.  I still dont think it constitutes torture. I want to be clear that we as the audience know that this is wrong because we know that Homeworld is wrong.  We know that Lapis wasnt disloyal to Homeworld and only wanted to protect Steven.  Peridot now knows shes hurt Lapis so shes apologizing.  I agree with you on the card part and even on the pool part that were supposed to feel awkward because Peridot is being insensitive and doesnt fully understand what shes apologizing for.  My entire point hasnt been that Peridot has done nothing wrong.  My point is that Peridot didnt torture and abuse Lapis.  I dont think its quibbling with the details to make the distinction between being a asshole and abusing someone.  But I get the impression that were ultimately going to end up disagreeing on this topic.,stevenuniverse,d3ne57f,5,t5_2viyl
7752681,0,t1_d3nefob,I have to admit I always assumed that the dissapearance of Lapis between Ocean Gem and  The Message after we saw Lapis flapping off with her waterwings implied that Peridot had intercepted Lapis near Earth after Marble Madness. That would explain how Peridot was completely surprised by Steven and the Crystal Gems when she saw him  but had all the information she needed when the hand ship crashed. My idea that Peridot made up for the  years to the next star system time issue for Lapis trip home was debunked at some point when it became clear that Lapis DID make it home on her own somehow and that Peridot also went back to Homeworld and GOT Lapis in the short time between Marble Madness and The Message. It is still completely clear that Lapis interrogation was disturbing enough for her to sneak a message to Steven and that she was bundled onto the ship and sent back to earth against her will and that after the long wrongful imprisonment by Homeworld she was being questioned and locked up again with even LESS cause.My assumptions that she was immediately imprisoned upon arriving back at Homeworld are possibly a holdover from the debates about how long it should have taken her to get anywhere useful under the power of her waterwings.  But if you want to believe she made it home quickly and had a whole  months to relax before being locked up and interrogated again that doesnt exactly change the nature of her imprisonment as a witness being unusually like psychological torture.,stevenuniverse,d3nf7aj,0,t5_2viyl

People liked Peridot before she started showing us her true colors because they saw her potential and thought she gave off a nerdy gamergirl kinda vibe. People like Jasper because of the potential they see in her shes strong and opinionated but respects those stronger than her and she gives off a vegeta kinda vibe. Malachite served to hold back Jasper and Lapis character development while Peridot got hers Jasper falling into a crack is the same exact writing tactic thats being used to hold back Jaspers development further while Lapis gets hers. Im hoping that her inevitable return is when theyll decide to start fleshing her out and give her something weSteven can sympathize with whether they plan on keeping her a villain or not.

The fact that you try to use snape as a comparison shows how completely off base you are assertions are especially since he not once showed a sign of kindness or care to Harry outside of secretly saving his life a couple of times where as Pearl has been the most devoted mother figure to steven since season .

Honestly we talk a lot about Lapis as an abuse survivor  because she is and its a totally valid parallel  but that was the first thing that struck me about Peridot once we saw her interact with others. How she flinched away from Jaspers gem destabilizer despite knowing it wouldnt be directed at her how she jumped whenever anyone touched her for a long time and how she was genuinely terrified of everything in Stevens bathroom to the point that Steven had to pacify her and promise that he wouldnt hurt her. When her manager was mentioned and she visibly flinched I was like AHA...! but didnt find all of the discussion and widespread theorizing that Id been expecting.Also that is such a cool design!

Seems kinda silly in a kids show who wouldnt understand that kind of nuance.I mean tell that to the hundreds of people on tumblr chan and reddit analyzing details and posting theories. If Steven Universe is about one thing its nuance. Note that theres a different art style to distinguish Garnets story from reality. Im not saying we can be certain that what happens in The Answer isnt the literal truth but theres plenty of evidence to suggest that the events of The Answer are a story being told by a biased narrator to convey a point to a child audience.gt I mean being sliced in half by a sword seems a guaranteed way to poof while an explosion might not necessarily disrupt your form.Not in real life. In real life explosions turn peoples brains and organs into jelly and their bodies into dog meat. People lose body parts in explosions because theyll tear you apart as easily as any blade. The explosions Jasper survived involved orders of magnitude more force than Pearl has ever shown outside of Garnets storyscape.gt Did she lose to Amethyst?Id call being battered bruised and prone a loss. Especially considering that Steven had to save Pearl from the collapsing Injector. I mean we can get into quibbling over whether Pearl was really trying to win or who was more emotionally compromised etc. But the same sort of logic would necessarily apply to her fight with Sugilite.gt And to be fair Jasper had OP weapons.Jasper is an OP weapon.

7832465,0,t3_4mj3cp,I really want to see Centipeedle healed in stages. A full heal on the next reunion or through miracle although would be great but I want to see it as the struggle it is. Theyve been stuck like that so long and no one has figured out how to help them. Id love to see them get healed in stages getting a nearly gem like form that still shows some corruption. Maybe even still unable to fully communicate but showing more of their original personality mixed in with a slight unstableness from lingering corruption.I think Lapsis would be a good aid for Steven to start to heal the corrupted jems. I think she could sympathize with them in her own way. They are stuck in a form they have no control over. Depending how you look at it they may even have a mind buried deep down trying to communicate. Both Centi and Lapsis were treated as their own person for the first time by Steven. ,stevenuniverse,d3wfq7h,8,t5_2viyl

With these guys it seems more complicated. It gets a bit weirder when you throw Steven into the mix.There was an old thread that brought up the idea that if the CKs are the CGs then Lars is Stevens analogue. In a far more recent post the Ronaldo discussion someone postulated that Steven is everything Ronaldo didnt know he wanted to be. Sadie seems to have less to do with Steven on this level but shes always respected him as a person.If this holds any water theres tons of weird layers to uncover. For instance Lars and Ronaldo used to hang out in the lighthouse but dont hang out anymore. Lapis and Peridot started hanging out in the barn.,stevenuniverse,d3wvh25,1,t5_2viyl

I then proceeded to binge over  episodes in two days. This was all like a few months ago..? The cool thing about the Undertale version is that it is made by like  different people the background is an bit cover of stronger than you by someone the lyrics were written by someone in a comic or something the thing was sung by some guy and then it was animated in what you see nowThere are also like  variations of this pretty cool right?Anyways thats a lot of stuff I couldnt tell you before now D,stevenuniverse,d3yxfgg,17,t5_2viyl

I thought it was tame enough though and so did they. We approved the post. However as it has attained ten reports since the decision has now been changed to defer to the community and remove it.No were not always right. And sometimes we change our mind. And were far more likely to do so if you bring your concerns to us calmly in private instead of being aggressive making a scene and breaking rules.Have a little more faith in us please. Were trying to do whats best for the community here. And if youre concerned about things can you please bring em to us or me specifically directly through a PM and do so in a calmer manner? If you have issues with the subs moderation thats fine  bring em to us and we can try to work things out.

7974407,0,t1_d4cd8lr,Alright first off whoops. Meant to say Peridot could tell which one of the holes in the Kindergarten was Amethysts. Ambiguous wording lul.I dont really think Peridot is using biased science? Shes a pretty perfect YD patriot and perfectly intune with Homeworld bigotry but shes also a gem that prizes logic and reason above everything. I think its a little bit of both in that she uses her research to help back the bigotry but even then I dont see her using her data explicitly in support of that so much as shes stating it matteroffactly and not realizing her insensitivity in doing so. The only real instance of her doing this would be in Back To The Barn and even then she doesnt whip out the gem pseudoscience to dis Pearl. She just falls back on Homeworld social standards.In all fairness I think RQs probably are extinct now after the rebellion. Cant have the kind of risk left up in the air and given how Homeworld culture primes gems to think of their gem type as a key component of their psyche chances are...Your AU is cool! This might give you some ideas on the Diamond hierarchy I just found it and I thought it was a cool read. Off topic but are you making a full fic out of this orrr..?

7987896,0,t3_4olukr,I disagree with your premise of Pearl as an example of white diamonds court. Pearls are a serving class I suspect yellow and blue Pearl would also be able to produce holograms and manipulate light and space because those things are useful to their owners. I think youre on to something though with Yellow and Blue diamonds powers. I would speculate further that the Diamonds powers are tied to universal forces yellow energyelectricity blue  water super speculative pink fire but white we have no real evidence for maybe light if you were right about Pearls homeworld owner.I know you didnt want to touch on Pink Diamond but I think the Rubies based on their colouring must have been associated with Pink Diamond. Lots of people have speculated that Roses healing and knack for creating life is evidence of Pink Diamonds powers. I would explain this as an individual trait of Rose Quartz which is tied into her inherent maternal personality. This could either be a Gem trait or a individual personality trait depending if you believe the theory that Rose was sent because of her particular skills to be a kindergartener of some kind. Long incoherent rant over! I really enjoyed your video btw.  ,stevenuniverse,d4dwz8e,1,t5_2viyl

7990372,0,t1_d4amfc8,gt Youre still confusing codependence in relationships with codependence in all of society. Humans have needed each other to survive for all of history and I am not denying this the focus is on codependence vs. complete dependence in a romantic relationship.Yes and I see the distinction between codependence in romantic relationships vs codependence in every other aspect of life as an arbitrary one.gt The difference between codependence and complete dependence in a relationship is that in the former you are able to function without your partner. In the latter you are not.Okay so why is the latter a bad thing in romantic relationships  assuming its mutually consensual and theres no abuse going on  when the complete dependence you describe is the norm in every other aspect of human life?Then theres the whole issue of the nature of the complete dependence itself. What does it mean to function in this context? Rubys function before meeting Sapphire was to serve as cannon fodder  she was a literal redshirt. Sapphires function is less clear but it involved serving in Blue Diamonds court as some kind of oracle. Do you get the impression that they couldnt go back to those roles if they wanted to or if they had to? I dont. But why would they want to when theyre capable of so much more together? Itd be one thing if you could point to an instance where existing has Garnet has left them in some way less capable than they were before but so far it seems like being Garnet gives them a new personality and new abilities that they never had before they met. Of course theyd lose that focused versatility and confidence when they split up  it was always a property of Garnet.,stevenuniverse,d4e6zuf,1,t5_2viyl

It was a pretty easily refutable theory more so now that we know what Quartz Gems are and thats why she and Amethyst have so many common traits but thats beside the point but some people held on to it for some reason. It raised some arguments here and there but it descended into utter madness in the sub when someone edited her eyes to show it was most likely a design choice to make her look more intimidating then people started giving her other characters eyes then faces then everything spiraled out of control really fast and new was flooded with Jaspers face edited in many ways for a while drowning all relevant content until mods started deleting posts and temporarily banning people for repeatedly posting what was then dubbed Jaspers eyes edits.

8108292,0,t1_d4re7rw,Peridot tends to take the fully logical and pragmatic choices when in a bind while Steven goes for the gut instinct and emotions. I feel they would have a lot of conflicts when approaching situations and using their powers when not fully in sync. That would limit their powers from going full duce total savior until later in the series.Back when going down to drill and destroy the cluster Steven was already feeling sorry for it. Peridot understood where he was coming from but looked at it logically. It wasnt its fault but it was going to destroy the world regardless destroying it first was the only way to her.  This little conflict could cause some hiccups in their powers of healing limiting them at times. Or even moments like Stevens healing spit going away due to doubt. In contrast Peridot has excessive amounts of confidence. Steven getting hesitant while Peridot barreling ahead assured that it would work due to her thinking could easily cause a power or ability to fizzle out on them.,stevenuniverse,d4rg0vt,5,t5_2viyl

8125491,0,t3_4qi8gk,You just stumbled into a couple of my favorite episodes to talk about and I am over the moon.Edit wow this got longer than I meant apologies for the text wall. I got excited.Edit  An Attempt Was Made to make this readable. gt Episode  Keeping it TogetheryessssssssssI always hold my breath for people who are watching the series for the first time to get to this episode since it was my first episode and its always fun to vicariously relive the horror of this episode through other people. Also people who watch the series in order get to see this episode in proper context instead of being completely what is even going on like I was. I love the little details like Pearl taking over the chore wheel Amethyst when Pearls talking about the Kindergarten. Also the laundry piles. I also love Steven and Peridots interactions. Shes not particularly scared of Steven himself but if hes there it means the rest are probably close by and that bothers her. Steven is bad at lying even to the enemy.gt Do you think shes hurt? Aw Steven is not one to withhold sympathy even towards someone who kidnapped him and almost his entire family like  episodes ago.gt Huh. Ruby and Sapphire are having a GolumSmeagolesque conversation.Ruby is angry over the injustice of it and has guilt over them not finding these Crystal Gems before this could happen to them. Sapphire seems to be attempting to reassure Ruby that its not their fault they didnt know Rose didnt know...but she probably is trying to reassure herself just as much. And shes failing. Badly.gt Are you...alright? I wish you hadnt seen that. Man this dialogue is really good.The ending conversation is one of my favorite scenes in the show. Garnet seemed to realize Steven was going to want to talk to her and was waiting for him.  Steven asked her more about herself and how she was feeling and barely said anything about what they saw at all and in fact steered the conversation away from that particular topic because she was still upset over it. Basically I love it that both Garnet and Steven had the same realization that what theyd seen was really bad they were both pretty traumatized and they should probably check up on each other.gt Since she took over after Rose died shes probably had to appear confident even when shes not so that the team doesnt fall apart. Its an interesting idea.Greg Amethyst and Pearl were all pretty emotionally shredded up about Roses passing and Steven just didnt know what to think it makes sense that Garnet would be struggling as well. I think she pushed her feelings down and became really withdrawn because of that if she was falling apart while Amethyst and Pearl were falling apart absolutely nothing would get done. Shes been getting a lot better about this I think Reformed was a huge step in the right direction for her as far as Amethyst at least goes......but in Keeping It Together Garnet immediately covers her eyes back up when Pearl and Amethyst return. Even though shes been a lot better at showing her emotions in general she does not want Amethyst and Pearl to see her like that. She didnt want Steven to see her like that either but its not like she had a choice in the matter in his case.gtEpisode    We Need To Talk Again I am pleased you got to these two episodes. This ones got a lot to chew on its got some rockin music and it has Greg whats not to love?I find it pretty fascinating how the Gems relate to Greg in this episode. We havent seen any particular animosity between Garnet and Greg but she was considerably warmer to him in this flashback than she was for a good deal of Season . Her being the one to extend her hand to him in The Message was a big deal for him. Amethyst seems to really enjoy his company in the flashback and we know from Maximum Capacity they had a huge rift after Rose died...and Pearl engaged in very open rivalry with him in the past but in the present tends to spend a lot of time fixing his van. A shift happened in how all of them relate to Greg as a result of Roses death.gt Do you miss your home planet?That no never bit gets to me.For various Gems throughout the show Homeworld is still Home and the war was pretty traumatic across the board.Space Race showed us how much Pearl misses Homeworld she has the most attachment to old Gem ruins and while she goes on about how glorious the war was in Roses Scabbard her reaction to seeing Peridot in Warp Tour is I cant do this not again!.Garnet hasnt said much about Homeworld but weve gotten some good insight as to how she feels about the war. A maelstrom of destruction and death is not how you describe something you view as glorious victory this is punishment for the rebellion! Its not our fault! is not the words of someone who doesnt feel incredible guilt about a war they participated in.And Rose talked about her decision to stay and fight as though it was going to hurt no matter what the outcome was and offered Pearl an out because she knew it would be an irreversible decision. If we lose well be killed if we win we can never go home.And then we have our Homeworld Gems.Theyre Jasper who fought for Earth on the Homeworlds side and calls it a garbage planet.Lapis who was trapped on Earth for thousands of years and calls it a miserable planet and only wanted to go home.Peridot who complains about being stuck on the miserable planet she just wants to carry out her mission and be done with it.Its not as simple as we left Homeworld because it was Bad there isnt a single character who seems to genuinely hate Homeworld and everything it stands for and no one hates Earth just for funsies either. Its incredibly nuanced.gtFor whatever reason she doesnt think that shes as real as humans are and thats absolutely fascinating to me.That...is a really cool insight that Im not sure Ive ever had before.That human beings bit at the end breaks my heart every time. Steven feels pretty caught in between.There was a question you asked in a previous post about a favorite bit of character continuity. Youre starting to get into episodes where the character continuity starts getting really good. We Need To Talk probably wouldnt be such a powerful episode if it werent for the episodes that came right before it. Its fleshing out further the themes that they reminded us of before. This show builds on itself gradually and its so layered because of it.gtWhos your favorite fusion so far? Please avoid spoiling ArmsLegs name.Saying Garnet would be cheating so Im going to say probably Sugilite just because shes fascinating.,stevenuniverse,d4tdmoc,6,t5_2viyl

8175504,0,t1_d4zh2ed,Well thats two things. I suppose if youre open to nonspoilery advice on WtR and HPMoR...WtR There are some chapters that are called Renegade chapters. They started off as a sort of fanficwithinafanfic and became their own simultaneous alternatereality timeline of the main story. Figure out whether you like them then either ignore or read all of them. Usually denoted by red text at the top of the chapter but it was kinda screwy for an arc somewhere in the middle I think.HPMoR Harry is not at all the same character as canon Harry. Hes... really smart and a bit of an ass. If you understand that theres actually a decent reason for this which youll have to take on faith since the actual reveal of the reason isnt given until near the end of the story its way more tolerable. And try not to look up the author or listen to anything said about him. That way lies madness and people judging a story based on its author rather than the other way around.And as long as Im giving reading advicereviews...Pact Written by Wildbow after Worm. Decent story but Worm is just such a hard act to follow. Ending made... sense but was a bit unsatisfying for me personally.Ra Similar feel to Worm.. kind of. Less mopey at the begining? Way more philosophicaltranshumanistjesusImconfused. Take out Worms superhero and depression replace with modern magitech and brainbending.Worm Fanfics Oh dear god what a can of worms this is.

Thats the kind of ending I want. gtEh I dont know. I think at least the core cast will and should stay together. Theyre more like a tiny family than just high school friends and after all the effort to coexist for ages in spite of their issues I dont see any need to split them up by the end just cause.I think...I can see this too. I think what I really want and was trying to convey is an ending where they all stay friends. I think Steven and the main three should stick together for sure. I mentioned splitting up because while I dont want them to never ever see each other again thats terrible and no fun I can definitely see a few of them wanting to expand out or not live with Steven and co. or necessarily even near them by the end.

8249281,0,t3_4sdsrd,gt Why is this show so tame in comparison to shows like Adventure Time do you thinkIts a choice made by the producers. They didnt think adding the nontame stuff improved the show.gt and still end up with the same rating?There are two possibilities Adding violence decreases or doesnt really affect ratings in which case there is nothing odd here.  Adding violence improves ratings and Steven Universe matches ATs ratings by being good andor mature in more subtle ways.gt The fact this show is so tame in comparison really does make it feel like a young kids show nowI dont see why not choosing to resort to violentshocking things to capture an audiences attention makes a show any less mature.gt nowAnd more importantly if you didnt see SU as a kids show before I think its pretty silly to decide posthumously that how you felt was wrong just because SU doesnt include as much PG  stuff as other shows.,stevenuniverse,d58psd9,4,t5_2viyl
8250541,0,t3_4sdt8c,Your top ten list is interesting and I can notice a theme.  Each one focuses very heavily on relationships or you seem to like it for that reason.  Alone Together Roses Scabbard The Answer We Need to Talk are explicitly about relationships.  Keeping it together is more implicit.  Even Winter Forecast is on your list because of that perfect end scene between Connie and Steven.  A top ten list without Jailbreak on it is very different than mine though I cant say any of your choices are wrong.Now a note about pacing.  Im glad you did this one on its own since it really stands alone and because obviously you need to finish the next two together to get the pacing right as that concludes Season ... or really is the midpoint in Season  the decision to call the next batch Season  was decided by CN instead of the creators apparently.  Not important.Heres what is important.So... I know you said no hype.  And Im not hyping the next few episodes Im really not.But as youre catching up I feel like you need to get in the frame of mind of the current fans.After the next two ending with Log Date  the show was on haitus for four months as it often does.  From Jan th until May th we were sitting there stewing.  And then there were trailers.  And there were leaks.  And we were hyped.Ive never seen the fandom quite so hyped in a long time.  It was madness.So after you finish Log Date  while I know youll proceed ahead to the next one and I am glad for that take a breather.  Imagine if that was it.  Then imagine a long long wait.  Id say go browse tumblr impatiently except that you shouldnt get spoilers.  Take a walk and just... THINK about what might come next.  Where do you think the show will go?  What will they do?  Hell spend a little extra time chatting.THEN dive into the next five.  Youll be in the right frame of mind to watch them as we did.You know... or not.  After you finish the last episode youll be enjoying the haituses with us in real time!  Arent you glad?!,stevenuniverse,d58vgxr,3,t5_2viyl

The only winner that would make me furious would be PPG which probably got the nod on namerecognition alone. Once Upon a Townsville at least seems like one of the leastworst episodes?I think The Answer has a very very good chance this year but Id understand if Hall of Egress won. The Answer is one of those episodes that you dont really appreciate how spectacular it is until you rewatch it outside of the context of the Peridotmain storyline. It was at a disadvantage of being in the final Stevenbomb of Peridots redemption arc so more people were invested in seeing how that arc would end.

Rose wouldnt have put a gem with ill intentions or evil secrets inside of Lion where Steven might stumble upon it before hes ready for itby accident. So Bismuths purpose is positive and good in nature.But we also know she was poofed during battle and bubbled before she reformed. So Rose made the decision to bubble her and then the decision to give her to Steven separately. So those two motivations can be different. It could be a case of Shes too wild so Im bubbling her. and THEN But she can make Steven a new weapon so Ill give her to him. Theres no war now so Bismuth shouldnt get out of hand. The total answer isnt one contiguous line.Its likely two separate moments that led to her first being bubbled and then at some point in the future her being put inside Liongiven to Steven.,stevenuniverse,d5fs88z,10,t5_2viyl

Ill keep this one a little shorter than I usually send people just because I want to work on the next post.Avas Demon Avas Demon is a fantastic series with an emphasis on its crisp and colorful artstyle and horror elements. It has a really strong start and hooked me by the fourth page.Kill Six Billion Demons Another fantastically drawn series this is one of the most complex series I recommend to people both in regards to the story and art. Its a joy to look at and has some wonderfully creative characters so its definitely worth a look.How to Love One of the funniest webcomics Ive ever read its also one of the most heartwarming. Its a simply webcomic talking about different aspects of love and I reread it every once in a while just to feel good.Gunnerkrigg Court I think this is probably the series most people I talk to are familiar with and for good reason. Its an incredibly written comic with a fascination world and fantastical characters. I absolutely recommend this to everyone.As the Crow Flies My favorite comic here in terms of art As the Crow Flies makes beautiful use of colored pencil art to create some of the most gorgeous shots Ive seen. It doesnt hurt that its a damn good story too.Paranatural A series with a particular resemblance to a certain FLCL this one is flat out fun. The most recent arc ended in a supernatural dodgeball game for gods sake. Its a great series with a lot to offer.,stevenuniverse,d5hkvvj,2,t5_2viyl

8331446,0,t3_4tobgk,This song is great not just on a musical level but what it means for Pearls character. Shes obsessive she doesnt let things goampmdashwhether its training Connie to protect Steven with her life or going to space or fusing with Garnet etc.ampmdashuntil someone comes along to snap her out of it.But not here! This is different! Sure Steven sets up a situation where she has to face the problems her obsession is causing but when she does she overcomes the problem herself. She recognizes her obsession. She sees that shes been holding on long past the point that its over. Thats a major character development thats been brewing since Friend Shipampmdashthe resolution of which felt uneasy and forced and a little too fast because it was just one more step along her character arc to this point.And in the song Pearl vocalizes not just that but the dynamic of feeling that she needs to be there for Steven because hes Roses son. Thats something the show let alone Pearl herself has never explicitly said.So the musical number is quintessentially Pearl as shes been portrayed through the whole series but also a monumental turning point for her as a character. Wrapping those two things up together and connecting them so flawlessly is great writing. will watch on repeat several more times.,stevenuniverse,d5izie8,272,t5_2viyl

Pearls song is about her undying but impossible love for Rose and dealing with the emotional fallout of Roses choice of GreggtPearl and choice to ultimately leave her behind. Amethyst does have her own baggage that shes sung about but she doesnt seem to have any relationships of that emotional gravitas and keep in mind shes much younger than the other gems.

Its been weighing on his mind for a while and now the CGs are having the worst argument hes ever seen which they probably wouldnt having if Rose was like...here. The problem with that line of thought is that there is a very very clear and obvious reason for them to be fighting. Theyre fighting because of Sardonyx. Theyre fighting because someone manipulated them into fusing and it takes a couple of leaps in logic to say Steven would know it wouldnt happen if Rose was there it only literally wouldnt happen if Rose was there because Pearl would be too easy fusing with her instead. Home was awful because Pearl. Here is awful because in the absence of Pearl still Pearl. While you can go over it with a finetoothed comb and tie it to his complicated feelings for his mom the fact remains that the following line Its not your fault! comes with a very heavy Duh! component.,stevenuniverse,d5jlvh6,20,t5_2viyl

In a rear wheel drive car the weight shifts towards the rear of car during acceleration so your would want to your front suspension adjusted to compensate for that along with weight distribution. With Gregs car the suspension is most likely just well built from the factory as is would have to have aftermarket suspension to be adjustable.

8425408,0,t1_d5ubb3l,Of course you can. I never said you couldnt. I just said this is the path most TV shows take.One of my favorite cartoons is Phineas and Ferb which is  a monster of the week problem of the week show. Another notable example is Pokemon or any Looney Toons ever. The problem here and the reason why SU is moving away from this is that shows that are pure Monster of the Week cannot have a deep moving plot. Their need to be recurring their need for running gags and their need to always end at equilibrium stifles any deep dramatic storytelling. You cant rock the boat per se because if you do then you cant have a monster of the week episode next week. So a lot of shows start in this style and then once they are ready to throw you a loop they leave this style and typically dont come back to it.Could Steven Universe make more MotW episodes? Absolutely just like they make these Beach City episodes. But they need a narrative plot reason. Id love to see Lapidot go on a mission to recover some artifact Lapis remembers from long ago and to fight a monster.However! In SU especially knowing all we do now about corrupted gems...would Steven even fight a corrupted monster? Hed likely try to save it or befriend it Centipeedle style. That also makes MotW episodes hard to return to. The Steven who wanted to go on those missions and fight monsters...isnt here anymore. Hes a different Steven.,stevenuniverse,d5upubc,0,t5_2viyl

8434949,0,t1_d5vw92s,I think they will make her a sympathetic character at the very least. I personally think Jasper brings an interesting dynamic to the cast. There is no one who is quite like her. Garnet is made of love Pearl wasnt made for fighting and Amethyst is a warrior gem who was raised on earth. Jasper is very much a warrior which would be portrayed as a positive feature in many video game stories or in roleplay. But when you think about it now that shes stuck on earth she doesnt really fit in anywhere. Even Peridot and Lapis have something. And being physically stronger than most other people doesnt mean being liked or even valued more so than others. ,stevenuniverse,d5vwp1x,3,t5_2viyl

Going back to my analogy if the mom defending the kids puts the beat down on the abusive dad is the dad the victim just because the mom happened to win in that particular instance? ,stevenuniverse,d5wnehb,-2,t5_2viyl
8441094,0,t1_d5wnsge,Thats a good point. I feel like theyve always stressed how the process of fusion is more about the relationships between the participants than the actual process. Given that the characterization of fusion is romantic it would make sense that maternal feelings would not function the same way.

8490276,0,t1_d62p6br,Steven and Amethyst have a lot of parallels going on really. Like their existence guilt issues. Amethyst always heard the others talking about how it was bad that more Gems were being made on Earth how it damaged the planet irrepairably by sucking away life force? and thats why the Crystal Gems fought to drive the Homeworld Gems away from Earth. And Amethyst knows that that whole thing is also why she exists and she kept it unaddressed for a long time but she thought that the other Crystal Gems blamed her for that. Even after the issue was finally addressed in On the Run Amethyst satill usually looks crestfallen in the background whenever Pearl and Garnet talk about the Kindergartens and how they damaged the Eart. And then theres Steven and his quiet issues with Rose and his identity. gt Id like to talk to Garnet Amethyst and Pearl about it but I think they kinda blame me for my mom not being around.They both feel like the others blame them for existing and they dont know how to bring it up. ,stevenuniverse,d62tz5i,24,t5_2viyl

8504413,0,t1_d63rxvc,But I only got downvoted on the comment addressed to you. lolSneaky sneaky thats not even how its supposed to be used but okay.Most people would base their serious opinions on proof unless they are superstitious or belong to some faith in which theyd probably think along your lines. Just because we didnt see it doesnt mean it didnt happen. Which is true in a lot of cases but thats not how conclusions are made. You dont base them on what could happen you base them on what actually happened. Of course this is a TV show in which the end is already determined so it works a bit differently but my point stands.To put it into perspective weve only seen the corrupted Jaspers in  episodes. Yet weve seen many examples of different gem orientations since Season . None of which have had their gems implanted in such an odd manner.In case youre wondering I was always on the side of Garnet being a fusion and I actually really like the theory in the thread but this is more about addressing the behavior Ive just observed. Its tacky.While the people who were against the fusion theory were ultimately wrong they had their own counterarguments which help up decently. It wasnt until the show proved it that people would say beyond a reasonable doubt that Garnet is a fusion.Nate didnt explicitly say that and you yourself made the assumption. You and the others took personal offense to being confronted with someone saying no. Just saying. It wasnt until his later comments where he made his position too concrete and his argument fell apart but those are less downvoted than his opening comments which is just stupid on the peoples part.,stevenuniverse,d64ltkr,1,t5_2viyl

8515910,0,t3_4wd4ak,I loved this episode. Like you said it really is interesting to see how a homeworld soldier felt during the war. Centi was just there to build  as far as we know she wasnt an inherent fighter. When you think about it shes kind of in the same situation as Lapis. She probably hated it as much as anyone else considering the look of disgust on her face. The diamonds didnt care about their soldiers enough to wait for the ones that got left behind before causing the corruption. It really shows how much power they have over their people and what theyre willing to sacrifice. Remember these people most likely didnt even want to fight in the first place. Its important to enforce that Theres no such thing as a good war kiddo and this show does it beautifully.Whoops! I wrote a lot today! That Im sorry at the end though.... It really got me.,stevenuniverse,d661qkx,2,t5_2viyl

I thought they were just silly but now I can see that is definitely their canon dynamic. I hope hope hope hope it becomes canon. I think it would fit a relationship dynamic we havent seen in the show yet. Like Sapphire and Ruby are the classic loveydovey couple that fill the Romeo and Juliet role Pearl was sortofmaybewhoknowswithRose kind of unrequited love Steven and Connie are the innocent cute couple... And then Lapis and Peridot are best friends who do stupid shit with each other and cause a big mess and they love it and also love each other. Its perfect.,stevenuniverse,d667ifj,25,t5_2viyl

So she was made during the Rebellion specifically for the Rebellion. And shes perfect? Yeah it shows in how strong she is. When I hear about Garnet and Bismuth taking out  battalions of quartzes when Garnet can barely handle Jasper alone her strength seems pretty crazy.The Lapidot was out of control and it was glorious. Im so happy to see those two such good friends now. The grin never left my face from the second Steven and Amethyst got there to the moment they left.

8518423,0,t1_d66c7lg,On one hand I want to agree and Ive mentioned this as part of the shows strength at times but I feel like this specific scenario was a real critical juncture where they totally jumped the gun.I mean I really think Bismuth could still be around if they actually sat down and explained to her just how much everything has changed. I think there could have been some real breaking points if she had so much as told Pearl or Garnet about the weapon and then got unanimously rebuffed and her way of thinking was challenged. But the way they did it there was no show dont tell moral it was spelled out as I beat you in a fight therefore your way of thinking must have been incorrect which is an awful lesson to end on.It was a huge missed opportunity to introduce Bismuth to Peridot as a way to display the effectiveness of the caring pacifist ideology or something which could have lead to character growth instead of yet another bubble.

8523248,0,t1_d66vf1m,Evidence against Rose  PD Weve seen two Diamonds and both have completely different builds from Rose Quartz and are much larger than her. Jasper on the other hand is roughly her size and of a comparable build. The two Diamonds weve seen also have completely different gem cuts. Theres no way you can turn their gem shape around and get the fivefaceted cut that RoseSteven have unless their gems have completely abnormal shapes not based on anything in the real world. Garnet Pearl Amethyst Jasper and Bismuth all refer to Rose Quartz as Rose Quartz. Bismuth specifically states that she is another Quartz soldier made right here in the dirt. Ian JonesQuartey has said that Rose is a Quartz Peridot a character shown to be knowledgeable on gemetics identifies Steven as some kind of Quartz by sight. Steven has seen the mural depicting Pink Diamond on the moon base even though we havent. If it depicted his mother he should have commented or reacted.Evidence for Rose  PD Rose Quartz seems to have a larger power set than the other two Quartz weve seen Amethyst and Jasper. Its worth noting here that there are some other varieties of Quartz mentioned that we havent seen yet Biggs Jasper Crazy Lace Agate and minor Beta spoilers Carnelian. So we dont know if Rose Quartz is truly exceptional among Quartz yet. Its also worth mentioning that Crystal Gem Pearl is stated to have a much larger skillset than your typical Pearl and that Bismuth specifically says that she admired Rose Quartz for going beyond her station. Theyre both pink.We cant absolutely rule out Rose secretly being Pink Diamond but its obvious where the preponderance of evidence lies. Im not sure how you would counter the large body of evidence suggesting that Rose isnt Pink Diamond without simply indulging in speculation.And really the biggest argument against Rose Quartz being Pink Diamond is that it doesnt make any sense. If Rose Quartz was Pink Diamond then she was at the pinnacle of Homeworld society. If she were one of Homeworlds four godqueens why wouldnt she have the political clout to get one lousy planet spared without resorting to war? What purpose would disguising herself as another lesser Gem type serve? How would she have managed this disguise at all let alone for thousands of years? Diamond seem to be unique paragons of the Gem species. If the Diamonds knew their waywardyetirreplaceable sister was on Earth why wouldnt they have made some sort of diplomatic overtures or if they assume shes deadcorrupted at least sent someone to retrieve her gem? The Rose  PD theory explains very little and just introduces a bunch more plot holes thats why its a bad theory.,stevenuniverse,d66yuob,3,t5_2viyl

8548208,0,t1_d69s11t,Another part that also helps is if you start watching a lot of the things of a shorter time spand then your mind will start expecting it and allow you to percieve more in a shorter time making it seem like there is more. Also if the episode is good you do the same where you absorb so much of the content that it seems to be much longer than it actually is. The same can also occur in reverse for things like driving. When you drive or walk the same way and see the same things over and over again your mind becomes accustomed to it so you pay less attention and the trip seems shorter over time the more you do it. Also when reading a really good book you feel and sometimes you actually do read the book faster if you are enthralled by it.

I wonder if we could identify the planets? We could go by moon count but these dont seem accurately portrayed presumably Jupiter is someones domain but it has  moons. The rings would not be definitive either. What Im also really interested is YDs two extra symbols possibly stars? Its also possible that WD has another planet in her hands if so likely Homeworld.

8564605,0,t1_d6c1cm1,gt Dang it I had been thinking about posting something exactly like this last night as I went to bed. But since you already made one Ill just contribute to yours.You still should actually! This is a great breakdown of the timeline and has more pertinent information than mine! Maybe new info will be given hopefully after Bubbled today to help at least some of these timeline issues too. gt Honestly I came about thinking about this less from trying to clear something up and more from the standpoint that things just dont really add up to begin with based on what weve been told. Granted given the whole Rose lied thing we could have some red herrings thrown into the mix and I wouldnt be surprised if it was intentional on the part of the Crewniverse to keep us thinking and on our toes along with actually portraying a real scenario but as of right now things seem like they conflict a touch.Yeah when I first started trying to piece the timeline together I thought the problem was with me and my ability to keep things in order but I do think there are a lot of problems with how our eyewitness testimonies are lining up together it kills me that we havent really gotten an objective chronological flashback yet. Which is normal since secondhand accounts of events tend to be inaccurate in some ways but also means a lot of what we claim to know is probably not exactly right. Im not sure how were going to have this war timeline rectified in the showwhether someone reliable how were supposed to define reliable is another problem comes forward to tell the war story or maybe Stevens powers can come in handy with this somehowI feel like itll probably be slow coming to have these inconsistencies corrected. gt ? years ago Pearl begins fighting alongside Rose Quartz and is a few thousand years old when doing so. The way this is structured in talking to Connie its implied that Pearl was extremely young in the context of being a Gem to begin fighting with Rose which would possibly imply that Pearl was younger. But if Rose was incubated on Earth and the colony was barely started before the Rebellion formed how can this make sense? The only logical assumption if Rose was from Earth is that because she was a Quartz soldier designed for the singular purpose of being a soldier and being in combat then this must strictly be related to the fact that Pearls werent built for fighting so even being thousands of years old doesnt provide even close to the level of abilityknowledge necessary to do so.Pearls place in the war isnt something I thought to throw in for exactly those oddities of her backstory you mentioned. I tend to think she was brought to Earth when it was being colonized but I dont have any proof to indicate this is true other than the fact that she was Rose Quartzs first follower or at least one of the first. Out of all the remaining Crystal Gems I think Pearl is still the one we know the least about concerning where she came fromthe many theories concerning who her owner was Pink Diamond White Diamond Rose Quartz herself some other aristocratic Gem is just one facet of that issue. Im not sure The discussion Rose and Pearl have atop the floating islandlike you said yourself it doesnt have much context so its difficult to order it in there. gt Pearl and Garnet are told that Bismuth was lost at the Battle of the Ziggurat which could potentially be in the desert where Lion would later be found in my opinion likely instructed to wait there to be found by Steven after Rose and Greg decided to have him.Ah I hadnt considered how important it was that Lion was waiting in that desert but youre probably rightsince ziggurats as we know them tend to be scattered around Western Asia I can see the connection of whatever that battle was about with Bismuth being bubbled there and left with Lion. gt yet Jasper who came halfway into the war still was programmed for Pink Diamond to be her Diamond and seeks revenge against Rose for shattering her? Also Eyeballs dialogue in Back to the Moon seems to indicate that Jasper was already active when Pink Diamond was shattered but Jasper claims that shes been fighting since she formed because of what had been done to Pink Diamond.I wasnt sure how much we were supposed to take Jasper at her word after watching Earthlings for fighting from the second I broke free of the Earths Crust but I have no doubt since she did emerge apparently halfway into the war that she probably wasnt exaggerating that much. Eyeball claiming she took out  Crystal Gems immediatelythat I wasnt sure about if only because it sounds like the kind of story thats easily embellished for war propaganda but then again Jasper was perfect so who knows?  gt Unless of course before additional ones were incubated and created Roses maternalish attributes manifested including her love of all life and her beliefs that Gems shouldnt just be programmed to be and do specific things outside of their control  perhaps even during those first battles for Earth at the Sky Arena as Pearl described. Dialogue not actual battles between Gems that divided the Gem race and set the battle lines for the war. And when this wasnt what Homeworld wanted out of a supportdefensiveoriented Gem no more Rose Quartz gems were incubated.Wow this is a very interesting point that I hadnt considered before but it provides so many possible character motivations for Rose! Quartz Gems especially those under Pink Diamond did all appear to be made for fightingbut Rose weapon summons a shield and has healing abilities. Of course this could just mean Rose was supposed to be a more passive type of soldier and any other potential Rose Quartz Gems could be so too I suppose. The fact that we dont see any other Rose Quartz Gems and Peridots ignorance of them does seem a littledisturbing. Its obviously speculative territory to wonder if there were any other Rose Quartz Gem types what became of thembut the fact that Rose seemed to be the only one left is well disquieting and says a lot about why Rose chose the path she did. The idea that perhaps Rose was a failed Quartz is another interesting possibility that I can see her connect with other life forms over and ultimately rebel against the Gems rather strict hierarchy as a consequence. Anyways this is still an excellent post by the way! So many interesting avenues for what really happened and how that impacted the Crystal Gems in developing. Id totally read a full post of yours about this especially if crossing my fingers we get more from Eyeball tonight because now my minds racing with all of this,stevenuniverse,d6c5k8t,2,t5_2viyl

You try defending yourself after a clean blow to the stomach. A gem poofing isnt death. We dont know exactly what causes a gem to poof. Anything that penetrates the skin would imply a minor wound to be the same as a major one and that doesnt seem to be true. We have no idea how primitive or not Homeworld forces were at the time because we havent really seen so in the show. We know that they had ships which could well have been weaponised and could well have had their gem powers. Another Lapis Lazuli for example would have wrecked water based humans or any gems near water which theres a lot of on earth. We have no idea how many other powerful elite gems like that might have been fighting for Homeworld.Plus humans wouldnt have necessarily had cities then or at least not as wed recognise it. Remember this was all at least  years ago. Thats before even the Bronze age. Humanity was not well equipped to fight.

8570254,0,t1_d6cl6s2,I feel I should clarify that I have absolutely no problems with what Steven did. My problems are with the writing and Stevens actions after the fact.gt Its been stated and shown many times that a fusion of even  weak Gems can result in an exponentially more powerful being. So to assume a fusion of  gems is weak is ignoring some basic fusion rules.This is true for fusion between different types of gems. We saw in The Answer that Ruby fusions are still rather weak when Rose poofed a three Ruby fusion with her bare fists. Furthermore Sardonyx took out the fusion with only a single hammer blow. The airlock was only useful in immobolizing the fusion. While that obviously made the fight much easier to call the Ruby fusion a serious threat is a laughable notion. Theres a reason HW lost the war to hybrid fusions and its because samegem fusions just cant compete.gt .You can accept the spacetime bending capabilities of Ruby ship that Eyeball could speak and be heard in the vacuum of space that there is any air for Steven to even INHALE when his bubble reforms but not that Sardonyx was able to propel them from the moons gravitational pull. Sure.No that is literally the opposite of what I said. Im saying that those things Except the FTL travel. That may be theoretically sound are so ridiculous that Im not even going to bother addressing them. Also Sardonyx didnt propel them anywhere after she hit the rubies with her hammer they stayed right where they were except the defused. The rubies were sucked out into space. Even if she did propel them with perfect energy transfer it would take at least .x J of energy. Thats the equivalent of  ton of TnT.gt So the Ruby that ran up to Garnet to fight her last episode was peaceful? The leader of the Rubies was a pacifist also? I thought that was this Ruby. After checking it was actually army. Still Leggy is a newbie Navy is a sweetheart and the leader ruby is aggressive but not out right violent like the other two.gt Im not saying this stuff cant happen. It can obviously. Im saying that its lazy bad writing that was obviously specifically designed to force Steven into the position where hed need to throw Eyeball into the void. gt Summoning his shield might drain energy but theres no evidence keeping it up does...gt Steven having to throw Eyeball into space condemning her to a terrible fate gives him a feel of what it mustve been like for Rose to shatter Pink Diamond.Yes I understand that. It was painfully clear thats what the writers were trying to go for. Unfortunately the path they took to get there was at best heavyhanded. Thats what Im saying.gt How would the show fare if there was never any plot development?The reason I am so upset with this episode is that we spent the ENTIRE Nuke devloping Steven as a character independent of his mother and her legacy and then in the season finale they say fuck that Steven pretty much is just Rose Quartz .. He throws the Rubies into space and never even considers going after them. Theyre essentially shattered because theyre going to float around in space until they hit something and theyre not things the Rubies will survive hitting. Steven in a single episode apparently killed more people than the rest of the CGs combined in their many thousands of years of existence and his first and only reaction to this horrific fact is to ask hypocritically if Rose actually shattered PD. This is such a bizarrely OOC scene that I cant even begin to understand what was going through their heads. gt Guess Steven shouldve just taken the L and died at Eyeballs hand to make you feel his remorse. Again I dont have a problem with what Steven did as it was selfdefence. My problem is that the writers put him in this completely absurd situation. gt Have fun pretending though.I have no idea what you mean by that.,stevenuniverse,d6cv35h,1,t5_2viyl

In A Fix  After the events of Alone At Sea Steven is worried that his tendency to try to fix things may be doing more harm than good. Greg Universe a dad out of his depth steps in to try to help.    This is another calm conversational continuation piece this time between Steven and Greg. Steven got up to a lot of meddling in the first half of the Steven Nuke and not all of his attempts were particularly successful.

That he has to often remind the enemy that he isnt rose. Its a deliberate choice of the writers to emphasise that Steven isnt normal that he was a product of his mothers sacrifice. Steven came from rose literally rose became him. You cant tell me that they are not connected to the extent that the possibility of the reverse occurring is impossible. In a show where fusion and corruption imo with the impending cure upcoming exist. Steven imo is the antithesis of corrupted gems.

And the yoyo weapon is a perfect fit for them its weird destructive adaptable and fun. I can imagine Steven and Amethyst fusing just to hang out as Smoky Quartz and wreck stuff with the yoyo.Also since Alexandrites firebreathing doesnt seem connected to any other fusion it could be one of Amethysts hidden powers as much as anyone elses. I think that Amethyst tends to give her fusions their more monster qualities Alexandrites huge mouth Sugilites fangs and split arms and Smoky Quartzs split arms because shes a Quartz and was made for war.

She could probably fuse with other Peridots though era  and era  rubies are able to fuse with other rubies but I think that lots of Homeworlds armies of highly skilled powerful Quartz soldiers probably got their asses handed to them by fusions. Imagine what like ten gems who are all wholly focused on winning a battle could fuse into. Alexandrite is a four gem fusion. Shes giant and has a ridiculous amount of powers. Shes fairly unstable but when all  gems are completely focused on a certain mission like beating Malachite theyre able to stay together well. The temple is theorized to be a fusion of the five main gems too. I think she was serious about not being able to fuse with Garnet like she was about shapeshifting. ,stevenuniverse,d6gqmuy,2,t5_2viyl

She was meant to be a living weapon a tool that is meant to serve just as much as a Pearl does even if shes treated better. Loyalty to the dead determination and acceptance of taboo subjects are all what wed call positive traits  but to Homeworld theyre decidedly NEGATIVE ones.They dont want Jasper going off the rails to avenge a fallen loved one. They prize loyalty to them not loyalty itself. And fusion is obviously out of the question if Homeworld had their way.Which is why Jaspers fate is a tragedy.,stevenuniverse,d6krju4,12,t5_2viyl

Whatd you do before you landed the role of Riff on Barney? oncamera acting lessons whatever! I just got a VA agent and have been sending out auditions like crazy is it true that Riff was the first VA part you auditioned for and then you got it?? because JEEZ thats awesome!!And finally this isnt a question but Im an intern at CN in Atlanta!

It is also heavily hinted that the device can travel back but also forward in time since we see that boat stuck on dry land Lapis stealing the ocean.If they have figured out time travel for a personal device whose to say they dont use this method and then time travel to adjust for correct internal clocks with the rest of the universe.,stevenuniverse,d6vemim,4,t5_2viyl

8734582,0,t1_d6x8p23,gt Why would you permanently split a person up into tormented fragments of what they once were and erase their existence from the world when you can put them in compact indefinite stasis potentially forever?Well during the war you might be worried about prisons full of bubbles being captured and the soldiers inside freed. For a ragtag rebellion taking on a superior force every such facility they have to hide and protect is another drain on their resources and another way for the enemy to potentially swing the scales in their favor. Gems may not have to feed their prisoners or keep them from escaping from the inside but even for them having captives is a costly potential risk that the Breaking Point would have eliminated. Also for a lot of the gems there was likely to be an emotional component. Homeworld was willing to shatter a Ruby for fusing with a Sapphire without hesitation so its safe to assume many if not most of the rebels who were beaten were not taken prisoner. A lot of the Crystal Gems probably wanted to hit back for that. I agree with you and with Roses ultimate decision but I see where Bismuth was coming from. She was in the wrong but it was a very sympathetic and seductive and not objectively incorrect kind of wrong. ,stevenuniverse,d6xgwz9,6,t5_2viyl

8769045,0,t1_d71ro1t,From what you wrote I feel like there might be a disconnect in how I try to go about writing the story. I try to make places and people and how they would act and what their goals are. Basically put in all the set pieces and let the players play with them. They have an objective so they will plan and think of how to achieve it. If the player stops them theyll have a personality and a backstory to come up with some way to work around the players actions. The detail I try to plan is usually details that decide what characters want and how they act not what they are going to do every minute of the day.But I understand why its a bad idea to try to write a story. I probably shouldnt have used the word story as its a bit misleading its more I try to create a landscape with objects and actors and let the players write their own story in this world. The most I do for advanced planning is What would happen if the players did nothing? and then let the players change the world they interact with it.Edit rewrote the first paragraph a littleEdit  changed the second paragraphEdit  changed the second paragraph again,stevenuniverse,d71smik,3,t5_2viyl

So many people want to be the next Kojima that people are easily replaced when they end up not being... so there is not much focus on improving the moral among the lower ranks even among the lower ranks.The environment itself has also gotten rather toxic not just in terms of working conditions but of attitudes.

Out of character!Stevens not some angelic being. Hes allowed to get angry. He can make mistakes and bad judgements.Someone he had zero positive experiences with comes back after months and acts just as much of a douchebag as he did before on top of insulting and cheating his dad.Stevens been insistent on doing the right thing several times before but this is the second time weve seen it applied to a bad guy. The first time was locking Peridot in a truck in a barn in the country without giving her the chance to explain just what she was planning to say. In any case once something gets on his bad side he CAN stay mad to the point where he acts irrationally like ranting at thin air while Peridot is escaping with the Communicator.Just because a character is cheerful and placid most of the time doesnt mean they arent thinking mad or burying issues like in Joy Ride. Sort of like how Sapphire can project a calm exterior when shes constantly bugged by tons of stuff on the inside. Yall know what Im talking about.,stevenuniverse,d733y2q,13,t5_2viyl

8798571,0,t3_50n2m1,Recommendations Steven dealing with trauma Edition  Full Disclosure   Post Mindful Education. As Connie found out its never good to keep things bottled up. Steven takes the time after they land to let his own butterflies loose.    Mindful Education was a great episode and its inspired a lot of folks to write in response to it be it spinoff material references or fullon expansions of the episodes contents. This fic falls into that last category it begins moments after the episodes ending having safely landed and defused Connie coaxes Steven into talking about his own burdens. As the title implies this is a fallout story wherein Connie gets caught up to date on some of those parts of Stevens universe she wasnt there for.Its wellwritten the dialogue is incharacter for Connie and Steven and its just long enough to be complete and no longer. And while I certainly dont mean to downplay those fine qualities for me the main draw of this fic was that it was so timely and so gratifying to read about this conversation happening. If you want a little of the same catharsis click that link and check out Full Disclosure .        And He Doesnt Wake  It cant end like this. Or Waxing realistic as we examine the events of the episode Bubbled.    By the time the Gems draw Steven into the Ruby Ship hes in critical condition. He doesnt wake. He doesnt have a tearful reunion with his family. He doesnt have a hearttoheart about Rose shattering Pink Diamond. When he does wake hes in a hospital under Dr. Maheswarans care everything hurts in his body everything hurts in his mind and he just wants to not deal with any of it.    In recent episodes Steven has been buckling under the accumulating stresses and traumas hes endured. And even surrounded by adventure and loved ones his recovery is slow to come. This fic examines the same arc but denies him even the comforts of feigned normalcy. Whats interesting is that this isnt just a sadfic kicking Steven while hes down for its own sake but rather by making things worse on the poor guy it forces the issue. This is an AU about Stevens recovery and maturation arc not just a fic about him being hospitalized for the first time.    This fic isnt in a happy place and it takes its time being there so this might not be everyones cup of tea. But it is an interesting take on an interesting period in Stevens development and Ive found it a worthy read. The twist on Mindful Education towards the end is particularly good as well as the little insights we get when we see things from Dr. Maheswaran Connie and Gregs points of view.  ,stevenuniverse,d75gv2h,2,t5_2viyl

8874462,1,t1_d7eg9h1,I think the backlash didnt come from what you said or how you said it but because of the principle of the thing.You came off a bit.... intrusive and pretentious at least in my opinion. It was just one word in one line.Especially because the internet and media right now are in like a constant swing between being drastically overly politically correct and backlashing with intense antipolitical correctness. Every time one side goes too far the other takes over again. I think people are tired of either extreme. I just want to express myself without everyone paying attention to every single word I say literally knitpicking it to find offensive things wanting to be offended.If someone wants me to refer to them as they he or she I will gladly oblige but I rather not go out of my way to label everyone as a genderless it before getting to know them especially because you can know someone for years without ever learning their gender identity. TLDR I want people to listen to my point and not my gender pronouns.

Google Stevonnie and check the images. She is routinely portrayed as female by various artists. Heres just one random example of this The writers can present this anyway they want.

Im not trying to be rude but you sound like youre legit being contrary for the sake of being contrary.They busted their asses on that song its obvious. It was sang beautifully.  They experimented with the right words to find the right way to say it changing a few minor details on how it was supposed to be sung in the process. It was a huge emotional payoff for Pearls feelings about Rose while reflecting that as much as she tries shes not really moved on.Greg and Pearl whove had a huge rift between them finally find common ground and realize neither one harbors any true ill will towards the other. Like what is there not to like? not put together well? What does that even mean? Every single part flowed into the next excellently while being sung with an amazing amount of emotion behind every word.

9036011,0,t1_d7xvmh8,That is... no. Im sorry thats not exactly how that works. The artist has a public tumblr thats true. Its still polite to shoot them a message to say Do you mind if I post this on location? Its their art and very likely at least part of their livelihood. By asking their permission youre letting them know where their work is traveling. Some people arent okay with their work being posted on Reddit as it tends to be sort of a hitandmiss spot for artists to showcase anything. Regardless the piece of art belongs to that person. They put it publically on one website for one audience tumblr to see it. That does not mean carteblanche permission to post it wherever anyone else likes. That art belongs to that artist who has graciously posted it somewhere that other people can see it. I personally dont like my work being posted anywhere without my permission as most of it tends to be for clients whove paid for it and given me permission to post it on my FacebookTwitter. I put my work on my pages for a reason  so that people can find me and if they like commission me. If I found someone posting my stuff on another website with a cursory link back to one of my websites Id ask for it to be taken down since I cant see feedback on it if I dont know its there. I dont know if this artist feels the same but in the future it might be prudent to ask first for politeness sake.

Much larger than Jasper who is held up as the ultimate pinnacle of Quartz soldiers at least her hole is according to Peridot.  Possessed of a VAST range of powers that makes Jaspers abilities look like a babys  healing mental possession creating sentient plant armies flight a variety of force field effects and whatever she did to cause Garnet to form from Ruby and Saphire note the rose petals surrounding the event of their fusion.  And all her powers are expressed in connection with the color pink.Of course we know Rose shattered Pink Diamond... after all if you cant trust the eye witness account of a Ruby what can you trust?  Im sure Pearl was just holding her hand over her mouth in shock not because she desperately wanted to tell Steven something that she couldnt  why she was in so much shock that she had to use her other hand and whole arms strength to hold the hand covering her mouth in place.,stevenuniverse,d81k56i,4,t5_2viyl

If it were then a lot of people wouldnt copslay. I dont have any art skills for example. That doesnt mean I cant pull off a Karkat cosplay  it just means that Id do it differently. Or how about a Lars cosplay? Honestly someone with art skills would be able to go into such detail theyd even pull off the ears whereas I would just put on the clothes and gel my hair. That doesnt mean Im not cosplaying or Im not cosplaying well it just means Im cosplaying differently. Fine your point about the hair. Guess what hair doesnt grow instantly. Whod have guessed? And have you ever seen Rose Quartz? I wouldnt know too much about it because Im male and have no interest in hair but it must be pretty difficult to pull that off.

Pearl wants to be with Rose not be Rainbow Quartz. Shes not obsessed with that aspect of being with rose. Sure she sees it as a plus but I doubt shed tell be like aw rose fuse with me youll feel better shed definitely be there for rose and probably care about roses feelings because she cares about rose.Ive said rose too many times but ima keep it that way.,stevenuniverse,d8aqi9p,16,t5_2viyl

For peridot even when yellow diamond looked at her she couldnt figure out who she was and had to state her cut. Whenever rose is referred to be the Homeworld gems they never talk about a cut or anything similar shes just.. rose quartz.and if you remember when jasper was talking about bringing rose quartz back to home world when they were on the handship she just says ROSE QUARTZ IS MORE IMPORTANT! when peri says that they need to check on the cluster.If there really were multiple wouldnt jasper say BRINGING A ROSE QUARTZ BACK IS MORE IMPORTANT?The show seems to be trying to put out there that there really is only one rose quartz.,stevenuniverse,d8fy537,3,t5_2viyl

9223728,0,t3_56nlem,I dont believe Rose is evil. Immoral? Well ... maybe. But not flat out evil. All of the relevant characters in this series have layers of nuance and depth Rose especially. To have Rose be just simply evil when is all said and done is hard for me to imagine.ampnbspRose had reasons for what she did. We may ultimately conclude once we have the full story her reasons didnt justify her behavior and that she was wrong or even immoral. But I seriously doubt even that.ampnbspFrankly Im inclined to think we likely wont have a clear cut answer  that she was clearly right or wrong in her actions. I suspect well all come away conflicted some saying right others saying wrong and everybody else just scratching their heads. Some will likely end up arguing she had to shatter Pink Diamond  it was the only way to save Earth  whereas others will respond with counter examples and accuse her of unnecessary violence.

9247593,0,t3_56zqha,Technically Rose only needed to create heavylight DNA for a human egg cell. After the DNA was replicated in the first cell division there would be no need for simulated DNA edit because Stevens new cells could be made out of foodnutrients from mother like any other fetus. Those crazy lines we see in jailbreak is heavylight scaffolding that runs between the cells. Id like to imagine that Stevens DNA and other systems are in a constant state of flux rapidly going through permutations to create a better hybrid.Edit its kinda weird reading theories about Stevens birth in this sub reddit because Im not sure how many people have had sex ed here or if theirs were any good.,stevenuniverse,d8o785e,6,t5_2viyl

9444983,0,t1_d9d3r9t,Lets discuss those points.gt Less savory possibilitiesHere I say there are none. Because those are asexual rocks that probably dont really know that less savory possibilities exist unless they spend more time with organic life than they should. I think this comment was no different than saying that someone owns a fancy dress. Even though defective Pearl was of higher value even among other pearls.About owning not a pearl it doesnt exactly exclude my comparison to secretaries. Sure you cant own a Lapis but you wont ever need one. But yes you can own a ruby squady. Sapphire did for her safety.gt Custom ordered slavesBut what is a slave on homerworld if everyone lives like a slave? Everybody gets born to do a job and serve a designated authority under the proxy of their manager or general. A Pearl born to serve someone under the order of a diamond is doing nothing different just that her manager is someone unique but of no less status since acquiring a Pearl is a very high status symbol. I dont think theres any real basis to compare Pearls to slaves in the gem society. Were talking about a society that puts sentient beings into objects and even that could be questioned more as imprisonment than enslavement. I say the concept of slavery cant even exist in the concept of a gem serving another gem as long as its done under the homeworld rules and diamonds orders.,stevenuniverse,d9d7vmo,1,t5_2viyl

There is no way to measure what makes something good or bad aside from simply looking at the consensus standard but thats just based on a single survey of a specific group of people at a certain point of time. Switch around the group or the time period and perspectives change quickly. I understand what you mean by objective as possible since many people around here have some sort of similar basis of what makes media good or bad we all ended up here because we agree this is a good show right?.

Exact reason why the Soviet people banded together to fight the Nazis even when many nationalities initially had major doubts or the Chinese uniting against Japan. Maybe there were collaborators like in WWII but I think the Gems viewing us as untermenschen is an understatement. The choice of humans was either extermination for being organic or to fight a technologically superior foe. As per the latter human combat experience was most likely sufficient as the armor of the fallen contains middle ages Human armor that shouldnt exist thousands of years ago. Thus its likely that the Crystal Gems supplied humans with advanced weapons and armor the latter of which we apparently rediscover and given the fact we adapt quickly fought well. Also I think we did REALLY well because while an army back then of human auxiliaries could only be a few million the armor of the fallen is like a dozen or so sets unless it was only a fraction of who fell.,stevenuniverse,d9vkxnr,2,t5_2viyl

9610652,0,t3_5cm714,See this is a new story I can tell to people who say this fandom isnt toxic. I get that you tried to cosplay as Garnet. And I love the idea you did this but honestly coming from a black person I dont find it that offensive. I just dont see why people say it as racist yet I kinda get why though the Crewniverse states that gems have no race but they are coded as such. If you look at Bismuth you might think of a black muscular woman with dreadlocks or you might think of Blue Diamond as being an Indian woman. Its also not to even say much that the voice actors except Blue Diamond they all have Asian or black voice actresses.When someone who doesnt watch the show sees the characters they view Garnet being black because thats how shes coded she has a curvy thick body plump luscious lips has a huge afro some shade of brownish skin and has a deep soulful black women voice actress. If that doesnt scream black I dont know what does I dont think you wouldve run into this predicament if you contacted as another gem or human character. I will agree it is wrong but you cant change how the creator made and coded these characters and if they werent so racist themselves maybe theyd see you were just trying to cosplay as Garnet its just the way you did it or even why you did it. Blackface is a racist expression its about as racist as the KKK. Its mostly just about white people painting there faces black to make fun of black people. It happens commonly on Halloween and during Black History Month.I faced a similar racist problem on YouTube when I thought Centipeedle had black skin and when I thought Amethyst might be mexican. I said that because Amethyst is known to be fluent in Spanish and she has a mexican sounding voice though her voice actress is Filipino. Yet if she were human I think Amethyst would be mixed people may get triggered because she has that loud crazy party attitude like black people and yet shes chill and loves mexican stuff like Mexicans yet thats my opinion and many people have au fanart about this stuff. I mean even Jasper can be considered black because of her aggressive personality and her skin pattern is like how black people have those skin conditionsIm not trying to start race wars or anything. But Im just trying to tell you dont dress up as certain characters that are coded as black or even another race. Just dress up as other Pearls Peridot Lapis Rose Quartz Centipeedle Yellow Diamond or even Amethyst Jasper Ruby Opal Alexandrite Rainbow Quartz or human characters and you might be safe or get a black friend to be Garnet or other dark skin characters next year.,stevenuniverse,d9xpjjr,5,t5_2viyl

It was distracting to the point of bad direction.Also the show needs MORE filler episodes particularly with the townies.

Personally I like the theory that Rose used her as or to power a weapon as suggested in the Temple mural. But perhaps PD shattered as a result  or by accident.

9789608,0,t3_5fdh3q,Open Book Its a cute and fun little adventure with some good Steven and Connie interaction. Steven floats just has not much of a plot.Tiger Millionaire Not really a favourite of mine but I really do not like the new Lars. I find that it undoes a lot of character development and Steven comes across as very much like back in season .Roses Scabbard I really like the Pearl moments and the music  even though she almost let Steven die. I simply have no feelings towards joy ride.Super Watermelon Island The Malachite fight was nice although a bit anticlimactic. I dislike Steven and the Stevens quite a bit since it recklessly introduced time travel. Also Steven acts quite a bit like a jerk here.Serious Steven I wish we had an episode like this again. It is a selfcontained adventure with a bit of gem lore character development and action  It stands very well on its own. Know your fusion felt a bit like a joke that just went on too long. Hmm Id say Star Trek but mainly TNG. I grew up on the old series but after rewatching it recently I realize how cheesy it is. TNG actually had some great stories and it was quite daring how it went in favor of doing the right thing not compromising your ideals and always trying to find a peaceful solution first  and applying force when necessary. Voyager was the point where the writing become lazy and every problem was magicked away with technobabble.When it comes to Star Wars I actually only really liked a new hope. Even though I like it better now empire strikes back has its lengths and Return of the Jedi has a very disconnected feeling beginning.

So its sort of hard because everyone could have their own definition based on how the fell do in the simplistist terms lets say that gender is a dual with one side being male and the other female cisgender means that you identify with the gender you were assigned at birth. But with the dial there notches in between where there is a umbrella term by the name of nonbinary meaning you dont identify as male or female so under that ubrella term is genderqueer and this is where how I personally feel comes into playlets say I wake up one day but I feel very masculine in a way of feeling it may not affect my day or how I dress but thats how I feel in my environment. Or another day I feel very feminine same thing applys. Its just how I feel. The best way to give an example youll be BMO from adventure time how they have been called a boy or mlady also the apear the same in the gender swapped episodes.

I think Garnet committed something that implied it was dangerous to change oneself too much during reformation and the changes she did make were still humanoid and identifiably Amethyst.  I think if Lion being a normal Gem is the path the Crew is taking they need to give a precedent that its possible first.Im not saying theres  chance of this being true but with current evidence its not really adding up to me.,stevenuniverse,dalimm5,1,t5_2viyl

I mean yeah I think I do. They can be fun. Sometimes. I dont know. Theyre not great. Not for me anyways. I like action. And most of the animation and general physicality of Steven Universe has always been bad. Backgrounds are still pretty good but theyre mostly the ones weve seen before. I like magic. And thats pretty much all gone. I like adventure. And we havent gone on an adventure in what? The last thing I really think of as an adventure was Gem Hunt but that was just sort of a hiking slice of life so bah. Before that the last one I really think of as an adventure is all the way back to Marble Madness. So the adventures gone really. I like characters I can look up to. Gregs around but hes sort of been getting the short end of the stick like I feel like Steven doesnt go to him for advice anymore. Stevens been pretty self absorbed recently so hes not great. Rose is still good. Garnets still ok but she sure doesnt stop talking about how much she believes in love and I think characters should be a bit more than that.gt I guess no. I dont like it nearly as much as I used to. Sitting around dealing with super watered down versions of emotional problems isnt really what I was hoping Steven Universe would become. Oh well its not great for me but thats fine its not like things can hold my attention forever anyways.

Buddys Book proves that there are at least some humans who are interested in the documentation and examination of gem things left on Earth and IIRC in another episode we saw the skeleton of what was obviously some sort of anthropologist who had apparently died while looking for gem things.While that indifference is pretty damn strange the contrivance is not without possible explanations...The study of gem objects could not be very well respected in SUs world like paranormal studies or cryptozoology in our own. A lot of sites may be so remote or dangerous that humans have a hard time finding them let alone reaching them. Maybe its a larger combination of those reasons...or maybe no amount of mental gymnastics can completely explain it and indeed is not really meant to explain it and focusing on those contrivances distracts us from taking away what the show is really trying to talk about.,stevenuniverse,db3clwa,3,t5_2viyl

A Diamond shattering the strongest Gem we know would be perfect to show off the insurmountable the CGs have facing them.Shes important to Steven and Peridot but nobody else. Garnet Amethyst and Pearl arent gonna be too broken up about it. But since the show is from Stevens perspective thats all we really need.Her backstory is sketchy as hell. I can almost guarantee that she was lying and that shell eventually tell Steven the truth. Her real backstory will make us care about her more and therefore care even more when she dies.She was constantly miserable and lonely before meeting Steven. Anyone who watches a lot anime immediately gets worried when a character says Im not alone anymore. Granted Lapis doesnt need to say it. She just needs to feel it and we need to feel it. Unless you actually believe that this show is gonna let Lapis be happy forever. Shes just on the bus until the plot needs her again.She has never cried. Seriously go back and watch. Not even once. And she hasnt sung so far. And this is a show where all character development is done through crying and singing. The writers even admit it and freely poke fun at themselves for it. Theres no way shes not gonna get her big moment where she cries and sings probably at the same time. And after she does that well be more endeared to her her character arc will have catharsis and then she can die.You see Im a writer too. I know every trick in the book to kill off a character. If you just think of the story from a perspective where Lapis dying is the endgame every death flag no matter how small suddenly becomes obvious.,stevenuniverse,dbacg9t,0,t5_2viyl

Steven is actually the one manipulating her not in a malicious way  probably not even on purpose but he has been the only one so far to push her out of her comfort zone which is existential panic and lashing out ,stevenuniverse,dbaxje8,1,t5_2viyl

Similarly to my thoughts on Steven meeting Rose I think its more realistic to continue the message that its ok for things to be different or imperfect if you learn to accept them as they are. Corruption certainly seems to be a sort of illness both mental and physical and theyve already teased with Centipeetle that returning to a more humanoid form can happen so Im sure well see at least partial healing down the line. But in the same episode we were shown that Centipeetles can live peacefully in each others company so its not all bad. I think or at least hope that corruption will leave behind some scars in the form of partial transformations like Centis head or the initial spots that appeared on Jasper.,stevenuniverse,dbgftbl,6,t5_2viyl

10051296,0,t1_dbhp0li,Thats the THING about gems. Leaving them unshattered is a liability. More so than mortals because gems come back in full force after regeneration. The risk of them escaping bubbled or whatever other containment is WAY too high considering how powerful a single gem can be. Even weak gems can escape physical prisons so the ONLY option is bubbling and I just dont see that as a safe containment. One person gets into the bubble room and theyve suddenly got thousands of enemies INSIDE THEIR BASE.Its tactical fucking suicide. POWs arent dangerous to humans because they dont have weapons. If they got out they arent much harm unless they completely get away but thats not how gems are. Gems are dangerous the second theyre reformed. You can argue that its morally better but its tactically incompetent. ,stevenuniverse,dbhpjm5,1,t5_2viyl

Jasper was shown with the flower because she served Pink Diamond and even symbolism applies to a Diamond better than it would to Jasper.This raises some interesting points if this is the case though. Pink Diamond cared enough about Earths organic life to use a flower as her symbol. This does not line up with someone who would want to wipe out all life on Earth in order to mass produce gems.. The five petals are reminiscent of the fivepointed star which represents the Crystal Gems and Rose Quartz. I cant imagine this is a coincidence with this show..

The Ronaldofocused episodes are awful he functions much better as a background character.Priyanka Maheswarans character had potential but was utterly butchered in Nightmare Hospital. I dont know what they were thinking there her sudden change of heart came off less as the gradual warming to releasing some control of Connie and letting her take more risks and live her life and more as a completely unbelievable  degree change. She goes from helicopter mom to being okay with Connie fighting literal monsters who could literally kill her at any time?

The way we see Steven do when he connects to Blue Diamond and literally cries her tears even before he knows who she is or the reason for her sadness.So Stevens gem powers to connect with others through dreams astral projection would be inherited from Rose and an attribute of his gem type along with the ability to feel deep mundane empathy which he would just be predisposed to be good at.,stevenuniverse,dc4wo44,3,t5_2viyl

Instead much like Zuko she captured him with the intent to bring him back home.gt The Ruby captain held Jasper in high regard and the fact that Yellow Diamond sent Rubies to retrieve her shows Jasper is important and deserving of high esteem!This isnt a high endorsement. Rubies are obviously considered cannon fodder to Homeworld. Of course a ruby would look up to Jasper! Shes a specimen of a well endowed homeworld soldier driven dedicated powerful intimidating...everything a Ruby would aspire to be basically.YD sending a team of rubies to find Jasper was basically a suicide mission because she expected the planet to be destroyed soon. It was basically saying If you can find Jasper then great but if not then nothing of real value was lost.gt Zuko was barely liked by his crew!Maybe...but he was still the crown prince so they were still bound to do what he ordered by virtue of this. Jasper hasnt exactly been demonstrated to hold authority over anyone.gt Zuko was never held in high esteem by other Fire Nation Captains and most certainly not his father.It can be argued that Jasper isnt exactly held in high esteem by YD either.

Because they are both upset and focused on completing a task they are much more stable and less dangerous. Now that Amethyst has in a way proven herself and learned that she does fit in with the group just fine and isnt a disappointment or whatever it can be assumed that the fusion between her and Garnet will be even more powerful but more reserved.

10512462,0,t3_5qiw2v,The second option is more likely. Heres how I think it would play out Steven is poofed in a battle with some random gem and meets his mother briefly. He then starts trying to get poofed on purpose in later battles leading everyone to get suspicious. He eventually succeeds and meets with his mother again. This time however he stays in his gem and they both lose track of time. Eventually he comes out and it has been a couple of months everyone is worried sick etc. The biggest catch however is that the three remaining diamonds have come to earth in Stevens absence to collect more humans before the cluster emerges kicking off season . ,stevenuniverse,dczp6yh,2,t5_2viyl

10516605,0,t1_dczuq53,Im with you. As a gay guy from the UK the way CN UK has been handling Steven Universe has made me reconsider things. I thought we were completely fine with homosexuality. TV shows have completely normalised gay characters all the time. At this point Hollyoaks which airs at . is like  percent gay. And yet this shit happens? I think theres still this attitude of gays are fine and its all wonderful! But do not let them near kids. Thats sick. It makes me think everything Ive ever seen in the media that has been supportive is really just a sick joke. Oh lol those gays theyre funny and we may as well let them think its normal if they stick to themselves and their funnytowatch stereotypical ways. But still its not what anyone wants to be so children should  be taught to laugh at it and accept it as long as they are prevented from actually being it.It really saddens me. Thats not acceptance. Its trivialisation. Its akin to I dont want to even know theyre gay keep it in the bedroom! As if being gay is just about sex. Meh.,stevenuniverse,dd064yr,5,t5_2viyl
10516786,0,t1_dd06ehy,Peridot was also a nonWarrior class gem. Propaganda directed towards warrior class gems would be irrelevant to her. Furthermore Peridots ego regarding Kindergartens came from her status as a certified kindergartener. Propaganda for Jasper would be directed and used for Warrior class gemsones similar to Rose. Even though Rubies are below Quartz in the Gem Hierarchy the way in which Eye Ball worded her statement does heavily imply admiration that goes beyond mere recognition of authority.Also as for her failure to protect her diamond and colony Homeworld gave the order to retreat. A single soldier would not be used as a scapegoat in this scenariothe retreat not rebellion. Jasper would not be viewed by the Homeworld collective as the cause or failure to quell the rebellion. In fact Homeworld as I previously said would spin Jasper into a symbol of success. You have to remember this is a caste society. Gems in a caste society conform to their roles. If Homeworld acknowledged ANY failure in quelling the Earth Rebellion the authority of the Diamonds would be questioned. It is for this reason the reject gems were sent to work at the Zoo. The Zoo is far from Homeworld. Far enough that Holly Blue acknowledged they were nearly forgotten about.Also one final note Peridot is an Era Peridot who is FAR removed from the Rebellion. By the time of Peridots birth such propaganda would be all but forgotten. Peridot didnt even have detailed information about the rebellion when she was assigned to check on the cluster. The Crystal Gems were a complete unknown to her. ,stevenuniverse,dd06vli,8,t5_2viyl

All of it is just done in order to convince Peridot to tell the Gems about the Cluster at the end making it feel like a middle episode in her arc much like how Beta is pretty much all setup for Earthlings.As a whole Back to the Barn right after is a much stronger and focused episode.,stevenuniverse,dd1be9m,7,t5_2viyl

Its good enough to be used in place of other gems. Pearl necklaces earrings etc.gtAlthough these may also be legitimately referred to as pearls by gemological labs and also under U.S. Federal Trade Commission rules and are formed in the same way most of them have no value except as curiosities.Under trade laws a Pearl is a gem.

Sugar and the Crewniverse are some unabashed mangaanime fans and this particular episode was part homage to Shokugeki no Souma literally translated as Food Wars hence the episode name part reference to literally any battle manga and part background characterbuilding.Best way Ive found to watch SU is to treat it like a Studio Ghibli film.

10697466,0,t1_ddjatas,Im not really sure its probably a bandwagon issue. Or people are getting tired of waiting for her character focus time or something. SU has elevenminute episodes so they dont really do Bplots they kinda focus on one thing per episode and sometimes that means leaving plot and character threads into the waiting zone. It was less apparent when there were less characters and the series had a consistent airing schedule instead of hiatus after hiatus after hiatusI think theres this issue where a lot of the SU fandom is on Tumblr and Tumblr culture has a problem with this pedestaldemonization dichotomy. I mean its probably not endemic to Tumblr but it shows up there a lot. As long as something is on a pedestal people will pretty much ignore all flaws. However when a flaw is acknowledged the thing moves away from the pedestal and because this culture deals in absolutes when something is off the pedestal it can sorta fall directly into the demonization zone. For this to happen there doesnt even have to be any real huge difference in the amount of flaws its more about the perception. Like a thing can move from being like...  problematic to being  problematic not real percentages but people will act like it went from  problematic to  problematic. It also works the other way  if you like something youll want it to be flawless and then you act like it is. If you stop liking it for whatever reason youll want it to be demonized and to do that youll start looking for any and all flaws. Ive seen this with both individual fandoms celebrities etc. and with people comparing things. I once was a fan of something that also had a different adaptation which was more popular than the version I was a fan of. I didnt like the more popular adaptation so I seeked people who felt the same way. In these circles people would rip apart the adaptation we didnt like and find everything that was problematic about it and then act like this was the reason they didnt like it. But they would barely talk about anything that was problematic about the version we liked. And while I do consider our version less problematic it was more like a difference between... IDK  and  instead of the huge difference they made it up to be. ,stevenuniverse,ddjd46w,39,t5_2viyl

10819446,0,t3_5upo8m,I havent really read any other reactions yet but I think Stevens outburst was a really well done representation of reaching a breaking point where you are forced to come out with things you dont really or at least fully believe because you just havent been able to work it out.  It can be very accusatory and harm the other person even if thats really not what you want.  It was another entry on the long list of very human and realistic if not pretty actions in SU at least in my opinion. At least I relate to that kind of outburst a lot.  For me Im always thinking and if I cant understand something I have to just connect the dots in the worst possible way and the that possibility haunts me.That said Im taking the position that Steven didnt really mean any of that and that it holds little to no water as a real theory.  Im aware Rose tends to be antagonized so I expect a significant portion of the fanbase to believe that A. Steven at least partly meant it and B.

10834063,0,t1_ddxfj9n,Just trying to offer insight. I thought the OP of that thread conveyed my feelings very well. And while I didnt start out to do so I found the emotion of that conversation too compelling to ignore and I ended up adding my two cents for good or for bad  havent decided that question yet.You consider bringing Rose back to be awful writing. Okay sure. Thats one opinion. For others such as myself Steven having a chance to talk to his dead mom was a wonderful thing to behold. It was genuinely cathartic. How is that a bad thing? Im confused.And I dont understand how grief could ever be meaningless in this context. Like I said I seriously doubt Rose will ever reform and therefore she remains gone  dead if you prefer.Pearls deeply felt emotions over loosing Rose to Greg and consequently no longer having Rose in her life arent going to be diminished because Steven got to talk to Rose. Gregs grief over losing Rose  something he expressed from the very first episode he appeared in  is not lessened either. They will both continue to grieve over and process those emotions. Its been  years and they still cry about it  I dont think Steven and Rose talking together would affect them. Same with Garnet and Amethyst.Now if the writers were to choose to have Rose return at some point in the flesh so to speak then maybe. But even then they arent grieving over Rose being dead  theyre grieving over her absence. In time once theyve moved past that Rose returning may be a positive thing. Hard to say. uh yup thats how it goes sometimes  time may heal all wounds but it doesnt always make the pain go away,stevenuniverse,ddxgh0g,1,t5_2viyl

10834719,0,t1_ddxful7,gtWe have no reason to believe the earrings will come back into play as its already been established that Homeworld knows where the Crystal Gems and Steven live. Err actually this is just plain wrong. I dont want this to come across as a rant or anything I just wanna point out whyIts pretty clear by this point that the diamondsHomeworld believe that the CGs are destroyed or corrupted beyond recognition by now. Remember that Homeworld nuked the shit out of nearly every gem on the planet. They had no reason to believe that anyone let alone the core members of the Crystal Gems had survived. The CGs were the ones who caused the Diamonds their ignominious defeat so if they knew of their existence why werent the CGs being hunted down by them? Homeworld clearly has more than enough firepower at its disposal to take them down. But the hand ship was the first and only contact made since the scouting Redeye in the beginning of the show and was only sent because the Redeye was shot down and they wanted to find out why. The ship and JasperPeridots contact with the diamonds were destroyed shortly after their arrival and theres no evidence that they contacted the diamonds in that time.When Peridot makes contact with Yellow Diamond the CGs immediate reaction is to hide. But theyre a rebel group. If the person theyre opposing is right there why would they make any attempt to hide themselves? Peridot specifically refuses to mention their existence the diamonds themselves never reference knowledge of the CGs still living on Earth. Yellow just wants to blow it up to destroy any reminder of their defeat. Remember also that when Blue visited Steven hid while Greg spoke to her and Garnet hid too for fear that they would be discovered. They also concealed their identities when the rubies showed up and at the Zoo. With the convenient plot element being that Holly wouldnt rat on them for fear of being shatteredSo with that in mind I think the earring theory is definitely plausible if a little far fetched. gtThe issue is the idea that because the audience assumes something is major that it has to be addressed.Its not necessarily that it has to be addressed. Its more that if your editing or writing lead the audience to believe that something is going to be addressed when its not then that constitutes a failure on the authors part. Granted it normally isnt a big failure but in the case of say the Bismuth bubble never being expanded on I would say thatd be a pretty big screwup,stevenuniverse,ddxiwq2,4,t5_2viyl

10911504,0,t3_5vwg9k,I imagine that music in the Gempire is probably a fancy thing for the aristocrats. They have a rigid caste structure so someone like Peridot wouldnt necessarily be familiar with music since it has nothing to do with her work. Its also possible that it used to be more commonplace but Gem culture has gotten more utilitarian over time and has much less focus on frivolities nowadays than in the past Lapis cultural shock upon returning to HW kinda supports this so Peridot as an Era worker Gem wouldnt know about it but the Diamonds who are much more ancient would. Also while the Gempire has art murals statues etc... it mostly seems to exist with a function in the graphic design sense. Or sometimes in a decorative sense this is a fancy building for fancy Gems its decorated so everyone can see its highclass. The murals and statues inform Gems that the characters or events pictured are important such as the Moon base murals featuring the Diamonds or the Pyramid mural featuring Roses actions during the War and the other Pyramid murals describing the traps and danger courses within the Pyramid. The selfexpressive much more random artwork Peridot and Lapis started making is different to them because its not made based on anyones orders its them expressing themselves it doesnt need to have any evident function for anyone else. Its more about the process of making it and how thats important to the artist. And thats why they think that MeepMorp is a different concept from Homeworldmade murals or statues or such. ,stevenuniverse,de5g07t,29,t5_2viyl

Oh and she tried to fucking murder Steven by gutting him with a knife. So there might be less incentive to rescue her.I could see that Doc Navy Army and Leggy all join the Crystal Gems and move into their own little home on Earth. The title Room for Ruby probably means that they try living in the temple andor barn for a while but they drive everyone nuts.Meanwhile Eyeball gets picked up by Homeworld tells them that Rose Quartz and the Crystal Gems are still alive and shit gets absolutely real for the Season  finale.

11117896,0,t1_dercaxw,gtAdvertising. They didnt just put the episodes on the schedule and hope kids tuned in.Thats exactly what they did. It happened every Friday so there was no need to advertise. Do you honestly think kids  need to be advertised to every week? They do that for adults because adults have lives outside of television. Theyre busy heads filled with all number of other things.Kids come home do homework and then watch TV or play video games. Its easy to remember that Friday means cartoons for kids. I remembered and still do.gtAnd none of that excuses the same day time change. There is no excuse for that. At all. I want you to try to find one. You wont be able to find one.I wish I had bet on this. Guess what? It drummed up publicity. Were talking about it right now. It caught peoples attention. Nowadays nost people use the internet for everything including TV listings. CN isnt the brightest but they know the internet is where people are. People are going to look online on their phones when the show airs.They then know that Oh shit the show has changed times. I better make a note of that. And they did. This entire sub is a huge thousand person sample size of that exact phenomenon .CN wants people to watch the show on Fridays. Unfortunately its not working and by all accounts it looks like the show will be put back in its Thursday slot.gtBut they dont need to care about the older demographic its a cartoon channel. They only need to care about the K  demographic.Times change. Archaic ideas like only children are watching cartoons are slowly but surely being show to be wrong. People like cartoons. Shows like Archer Bobs Burgers etc. feature clearly adult themes. You go back  years and this wouldnt even be considered. CN is trying something new. Theyre trying to embrace a new medium of information in the internet reaching out to new demographics and overall changing the way they do things. Maybe its not the smartest way of doing things but theyre trying. You calling doomsday every week isnt really supportive of that. I understand its hard to watch a show you love doing poorly. But every show has its poorer periods. SU is getting its first taste of that. Itll pick up. And hell if Im wrong then we remember the good times we had watching this and we look toward the future.

11217508,0,t3_603nv0,Assuming Homeworld was a terrestrial planet or terrestrial moon of a gas giant at the time the first Gems came into existencewere made it is safe to assume that by now it would hardly be recognizable as a planet anymore due to the empires intense exploitation of its natural resources. As other posters pointed out by now it would probably have undergone a similar procedure as to what was originally planned for Earth for the efficient use of all available resources  Peridot SE.As such the comments on a lack of or unfamiliarity to weather phenomena by era  gems who were most likely created or have solely been working in a completely gemgineered environment is a rather weak indicator as to what the planet Homeworld or the Homeworld system might have orginally looked like.Lets look at some of the other clues Peridot does mention the everburning sun suggesting that Homeworld either no longer orbits around a shining star or that the energy output of Homeworlds star is significantly lower compared to Sol. Navys comment regarding the sun is interesting. She remarks Earth being A planet thats not always sunny. This strongly suggests that Homeworld or whatever is left of it was originally a planet close enough to its parent star for tidal locking to occur.These hints favor the idea that Homeworld was orginally a terrestrial planet that was tidally locked in a close orbit around a red dwarf. Seeing how red dwarfs are the most common type of star in this or any other galaxy visible from Earth with the naked eye the idea of a rockandlightbased species developing on the sunny side of one of their planets doesnt seem that farfetched.Unless of course gems were a type of VonNeumannprobe that long surpassed their orginal creator. Then Homeworld might simply have been the first planet to be converted.,stevenuniverse,df3hoix,18,t5_2viyl

If it wasnt because of Steven vs Bismuth knowing that Rose shattered Pink Diamond wouldnt have the impact it has. Still a huge reveal though as Steven and we learn Rose isnt the perfect ideal being they told us. She has her hands dirty. Pearl vs Amethyst however does much ado about everything Their relationship and character development Amethysts dark origins and how it affects her the introduction of the Kindergarten and a glimpse of Earths purpose the music the heartwrenching tensity of it all and its resolution... My god. My vote goes to Pearl vs Amethyst. Easy one Homeworld Gems return. Another big turning point in the series but one that you could feel the stakes were really high. The CG having troubles defeating them Garnet being separated poofed even Opal not being able to stand a chance and Steven being knocked out after an ominous You have FAILED just as the episode ends. Feel sorry for Malachite as this cheap tactic ironically the strongest fusion weve seen to date wont pass the round.Although not included on the match up  or even on the bracket but really close to those moments to not mention shoutout to Full Disclosure as Steven finally realizes not after what hes been through but the reaction of both Greg and Connie that things are about to get real.QotD David Gilmour and by extend Pink Diamond Floyd Rush Black Sabbath.,stevenuniverse,df7tndo,1,t5_2viyl

A terrifying nonrenegade Pearl.Evil Lapis would probably be a Lapis who controls another element.Evil Peridot would be Peridots supervisor an Era  Peridot.Evil Bismuth would be a rogue Bismuth who rebelled with no cause and just built an evil lair with traps and shit.Evil Jasper would either be a perfect Rose Quartz or it would just be Skinny because navel Gems are all secretly evil.Evil Steven would be a human who studied Gems and managed to weaponize one.

11473230,0,t3_63rl41,Character Deaths are somewhat of a writers crutch to create instant drama. I find it more impressive that SU manages to create some without resorting to that. Also with corruption we have something thats terrifying enough on its own if it happened to a main character. If anything I believe theyd be going that route instead. Imagine for example Sapphire getting corrupted. Some dark implications right there. Even if it was mostly reversed would she be able to fuse again? Would Ruby be able to deal? Is being corrupted with future vision possibly worse than just being corrupted? So many possibilities to explore.A character death at this point would honestly be the boring option.,stevenuniverse,dfwhhs3,9,t5_2viyl

11501841,0,t3_64582q,Ok so first of I think there is quite a bit of merit in this overall. But I disagree with some of the details.  I think while all Gems would be super quick about it the strictly first one to jump to action in case something happened to Steven would be Pearl. She still frequently has a hard time to separate in her perception Steven from Rose. She is obsessed with Rose and by extension with Steven. Watching him sleep. Trying to show him the universe no matter what dangers. Reinforcing those same ideas in Connie briefly making her a singleminded attackdrone until Steven brings Connie back to Earth and then...gt Why wont you let me do that for you Rose?So yeah I think she would be quickest in that regard.  Im not sure Blue Diamond would rather run away from her feelings. In fact isnt that the entire context Whats the use of feeling Blue? Yellow Diamond directly telling Bluegt How can you stand to be here with it all? Drowning in all this Regret? Wouldnt you rather forget her?  Wont it be grand to get rid of it all? Lets make a plan of attack! Start moving forward and stop looking back!Its definitely Yellow Diamond whod rather run away from her past. I mean the rest of what you said about Blue Diamond there seems true enough but very specifically the fleeing from what causes them distress doesnt seem to be the case here.  And the songs purpose from Yellows perspective was indeed to cheer up Blue but I think it ended up having the opposite effect really bringing down Yellow.Now your analysis on Garnet I can fully agree on. Though that actually somewhat gives some of the theories about White Diamond being coldhearted some truth From an outside perspective if you dont really know her Im sure Garnet could be perceived as super cold. Cruel even. Remember how she initially wanted to shut down Jamie? Im sure to her it was make a small would early on set things straight it will heal. Wait and see and itll become worse. MUCH worse.  And perhaps a mild dose of not quite understanding humans. Something you rarely see with her. Its most common with Pearl. So I bet White Diamond is the same in that regard and then those theories are kind of correct. She is perceived as cold and cruel and uncaring until you get to know her better.Altogether this very well puttogether analysis makes me think though What if there is or will be a Steven to Pink Diamond like Steven currently is to Rose? It would surely not be the exact same I doubt theyll introduce another halfhuman for such purposes. But perhaps there will be somebody to fill Pinks void.,stevenuniverse,dfzqf3s,3,t5_2viyl

11617074,0,t1_dgcpmtz,gt I feel like her time has passed. In hindsight Earthlings feels a lot more final than it did at the time. I dont know. I feel the opposite way. Earthlings was kinda like a turning point for Jasper. She realised a few things about herself and she realised a few things about Steven like its a place to start. It also deliberately made her um...redeemable I guess? Shes never been remotely sympathetic until then. Its a bit like when Peridot was revealed to be a helpless little thing except...much more tragic and put on the bus. I doubt Sugar wants to turn the show into something darker at least not entirely. I remember reading in some interviews that she meant it to feel comfortable or hopeful something among those lines. And going purely off of what makes sense narrativewise and in the spirit of the show its a question of what message they want to convey with Jaspers character whos played a major role in the series. Sugars words about selfloathing like you mentioned is what I think they are going for but if that ended in Earthlings it becomes a simple cautionary tale against hating yourself and nothing more than a foil to Amethysts arc. In other words a halfassed message in SUs standards. am I even making sense hereI think youll be pleasantly surprised.

11792393,0,t3_689bg7,I think it was at the end. Why? Lets see what we know for sure.The Diamonds wanted to make a colony on Earth. Rose didnt want to started a war and all that.So Homeworld fought against the Crystal Gems for  years and they couldnt win now they had  options. Just leave Earth and move on dont waste more time and resources in an endless war.. Use a massive attack that would obliterate all gems on Earth the corrupting light.They chose option number . All gems were corrupted. The war ended. The Diamonds won. Now my hypotesis Youd think now they won they would just continue with their colonization... but no they just used Earth to incubate a superweapon that would destroy it completely. They wanted Earth gone. Then why fight for it??? Out of REVENGE. And why wait  years to avenge the loss of a dear friend?I think they were fighting for  years because they wanted Earth to colonize it but Rose shattered Pink Diamond in the end so immediately the other Diamonds went mad used the corrupting light to destroy everybody and planned to destroy the whole planet with the cluster.  Wont it be grand to get rid of it all? .Its the only way using the corrupting light makes sense to me.,stevenuniverse,dgwphce,10,t5_2viyl
