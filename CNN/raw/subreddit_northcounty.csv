6354437,0,t3_42nv48,Jakes in Del Mar is hard to beat viewwise. Overpriced food though I have had good food here inconsistently mediocre service decent drinks.Las Olas also has a stunning view as do the restaurants on the other side of the PCH from it better views more expensive  not create food anymore imho. Good lowendish Mexican food decent margaritas.Going further north Vigiluccis in Carlsbad has a good view and pretty good Italian food. Harbor Fish has horrible food imo but its cheap  plus cheap beer and a good view. in Oceanside has a very decent view good cocktails and good food if not always a very creative menu the execution is good. Theres also now a bar near Harneys with a very good view whose name I forget. Shitty bar food afaict but decent drinks.,northcounty,czbxgxm,2,t5_2sgv2

7430806,0,t3_4h0teb,Im a transplant from Austin myself. I live in south Oceanside and yes you get a little more bang for your buck here. Parts of Oceanside are definitely walkable as are parts of Carlsbad and Encinitas. Inland it is definitely more suburban as people have said. This area is like Austin in that youre going to find plenty of beards and tight jeans and tattoos but all in all North County has some gaps. For good live music youre going to have to head south at least to Solana Beach Belly Up. I havent found a good Indian food restaurant in North County yet and Oceanside doesnt seem to have one. A daytrip to San Diego scratches any urban itch you might have and there is plenty to do in North County but you will enjoy life a little more if you like gastropubs and craft beer as opposed to several options for Indian food for example.Of course the major thing to take into account is that youre joining beach culture especially if you decide to live coastal. People still really like Sublime here. Its just different from urban different from central Texas obviously. If you think of things being bikeable youll open up a lot more areas for exploration. And the thing is compared to Austin its nice to be outside every day versus the awful summers in Austin. Take up surfing and you only need to walk to the beach. Youll be there a lot.The commute to San Marcos from Oceanside is not awful especially considering youre coming from Austin traffic but there is traffic and its not awesome. But you can get a lot more house for the money inland.Oceanside does boast the best barbecue outside of AustinThat Boy Good. Carlsbad is good if youre really into cute touristy things. Enicnitas is bourgeoisethe Soc to Oceansides Greaser. Vista is okay. San Marcos is nicer in my opinion plus theres a Sonic so a little nostalgia if needed.Living here I dont miss Austin. I do miss things like Red River off of Sixth Street and the diversity of bars. I miss Tex Mex the Mexican food out here is fine but it is differentbreakfast tacos are not a thing.  And I miss things like Alamo Drafthouse and Eeyores Birthday. North County does not have the same weird diversity as Austin. But the people are friendly there are plenty of great places to eat and the climate and environment cant be beat. Its gorgeous here and youre not a blueberry in a bowl of tomato soupno towns like uberconservative GeorgetownWilliamson County nearby. Best of luck with the decision. ,northcounty,d2mu353,1,t5_2sgv2
