If that doesnt work you can use a program like Hamachi to create a LAN set up and use the IP that Hamachi gives you.IF they dont have the ports forwarded as well it wont work. They need to do the same thing like you did. The easiest way is truly Hamachi if your having connection issues.Every one downloads Hamachi  DM Creates group  Invite them  They then connect to you via the hamachi ip.,FantasyGrounds,cncq6yc,1,t5_2t85t

When this page first loaded I thought I landed on an ad page because this is so drastically different from many of the other reddits.I agree LFG should be separate and this definitely needs related links and FAQWiki on the side bar as well.I would even say add some separation in the links for GMDev resources and general players.,FantasyGrounds,dbmzlaf,2,t5_2t85t

I havent seen many capable to handle what it can do with the effects and I saw a few kickstarters that seem to be pretty similar but just more expensive.The one thing I want to see is more art. I think it would be great to get a few more art styles though I guess I could always upload some.,FantasyGrounds,dfmdvxb,1,t5_2t85t
