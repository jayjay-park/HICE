6467712,0,t1_czoag51,Its called the Escape Pod Stash Box. It was sold in the artisan category for a while. I dont see it within the store now. Maybe it was replaced by the Delta box. Perhaps if you ask hobbit from mflb he might be able to get one for you. ,firewoodvapes,czob2hs,1,t5_3brxj
6474349,0,t1_czozbxf,Man I felt like I had explored all resources on here and FC and Marc told me to send it back with reduced refund. If he didnt have recommendations since I tried the battery swap and hold power button found within sub Im not going to sit around and wait for someone on here to figure out something. Dont you think Marc would have recommended something in his email if there was a simple fix? So thats when I post about experience with refunds. So you think I should wait another day to see if someone comes up with a fix or do you think I should return it to Marc?,firewoodvapes,czozsc8,1,t5_3brxj
