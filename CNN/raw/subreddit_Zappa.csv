62256,0,t1_celi0va,I think so. I really dont know too much about the backstory theyre pretty obscure. A double check would confirm Tom Fowlers place but not knowing what tracks were recorded when and where leave it confusing. The Zappa covers arent too great but the songs composed by the members are interesting. The original Mothers have always fascinated me due to the diverse backgrounds of the members and their later obscurity. ,Zappa,celindw,1,t5_2qrbe

1302702,0,t1_chhstzh,A very belated response but you bring to mind an enduring sore point  John French fronting the Magic Band. The reformed Magic Band had a couple big opportunities. If indeed as they like to claim they were to some extent responsible for the musical direction of the original CB amp The Magic Band they could have started making brand new Trout Mask replicas for example. And John French could have renewed his brilliantly idiosyncratic leaddrums style. Yes? No! French does a tiresome take on the Captain largely forsaking drumming and the rest of them end up sounding like a bar band version of the source material What a terrific waste of time. Who could possible give a fuck about this pointless endeavor? Just listen to this awful sax solo Don Van Vliet was a wonderful unschooled sax player  this is just inept.,Zappa,cig6589,1,t5_2qrbe

6463276,0,t1_czndkjk,I think Frank was always very conscious of racism. His lyrics may seem offcolor but its an extension of how he saw his lyrics as journalism chronicling the things he saw happening around him and exaggerating them for humor. There was and is a lot of racism in America so Franks lyrics reflect that. Its sometimes hard to tell when he was singing as himself and when he was singing as a character but I do not believe that Frank himself was particularly racist. ,Zappa,cznui57,1,t5_2qrbe

In some cases there may have been more substance there than people thought. In other cases there may have been less.What I like about Zappa is his irreverence  his Mad magazine quality of sitting back above it all and making fun of everyone while also showing a lot of insight about socialpolitical issues.,Zappa,d7ci3u3,2,t5_2qrbe
