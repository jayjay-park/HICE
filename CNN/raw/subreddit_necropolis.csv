6668048,0,t3_46zm9a,Just wanna say that uBurgy is definitely the one who deserves all that credit. He plowed through all the hard stuff I couldnt have done. Were it not for him none of this would have happened. Also thanks to the mods and people on discord for being there to bounce ideas off of!,necropolis,d09188w,3,t5_2x71t
6738012,0,t1_d0g9kh1,I didnt think of that. Yeah thats totally possible. But I feel like a lot of people wouldnt read too much into what he says cause well hes against you and making more rude comments than helping you out. But now were gonna be sure to listen to him. ,necropolis,d0g9om0,2,t5_2x71t

8264702,0,t3_4si34f, things I noticed.. The game doesnt seem to like it when you have more than one controller connected to your PC.... I got a flight stick permanently connected to my PC as I play Elite Dangerous on as regular basis. My X Box One controller didnt work at first after some trial and error after unplugging my flight stick it finally worked.. Not really a bug but an odd translation in the german version. The Black Guard is translated to Schwarzarmee ... this just sounds wrong. Armee  army. A better translation would beSchwarzer Wchter or Schwarze Garde. Wchter would fit best here as Garde usually just gets used as plural while Wchter is the singular of guard.,necropolis,d5an8m4,2,t5_2x71t
8289419,0,t3_4sxwqh,So today i finished a run in coop and at level  we got  different  elevators that would take us back to different level sSo it would be like Level A  A gt A and  then we had  elevators for B and C and A.Shame we didnt explore the level  areas.The fact that you can go back up a different path again reminds me of the Crooked Road Lore that you can find in game. It says something along the lines of going back where you came from but not taking the exact path.,necropolis,d5dqiku,1,t5_2x71t
