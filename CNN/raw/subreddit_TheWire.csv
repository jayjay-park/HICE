20118,0,t1_ceglrnk,gt I got a distinct vibe like a subtle hint that Levy had planned for Marlos phone number to be leaked to the police from very beginning. gt And furthermore when Levy finishes talking to Marlo in Jail he congratulates Herc on taking this firm to the next level.This is my understanding too. During the final episode I think Levy invites Herc to his home for a meal Yvettes doing brisket! and calls Herc a word that is presumably the Yiddish for family  someone else can confirm that Im sure. Yet another top quality moment. ,TheWire,cegq1zq,2,t5_2reco

The Judge talks to the Commissioner.The Commissioner never heard of these guys so he gets pissed at the Deputy Ops.He wants to look good politically and you dont look good politically by pissing off a judge.  The Deputy Ops never heard of these guys so he gets pissed at the Majors. He wants to look good politically and you dont look good politically by pissing off a judge or the Commissioner.

114630,0,t3_1vdjbb,The white guys Simon so viciously abused in this talk and not for the first time were William Marimow and John Carroll notable newspapermen who are my friendsThere it is he wants to defend his friends a noble motive no doubt. But for all his pontificating about the vagaries of truth and fiction his handwringing about biases coloring the way that essential truths are presented he is blind to his own. He defends Marimow and Carrolls actions points to their winning awards and then dismisses criticism of their company man ways as simply a sign of the times. What Simon has pointed out correctly I may add is that these buyouts and gutting of skilled staff started long before the Internet started eating into newspapers market share. Simon has said in talks that his was the third buyout. My father was a reporter at a paper in a large city too and I remember him talking about this exact thing as a child. He was seeing people with decades of experience and incalculable institutional knowledge being forced to retire. So when the Internet finally did become widespread it was a double whammy. The papers were not adequately staffed to remain relevant to their local communities. And declining subscriptions created something of a snowball effect The paper kept offering more buyouts in order to remain profitable. My father left in disgust after  years at the same paper. In his defense of his friends he blinds himself to the reality of the situation. It may be true that his friends had nothing but the best of intentions. But in the end it doesnt really matter most newspapers are a shadow of their former selves. And those who abetted this process whether knowingly or unknowingly deserve at least some of the blame. ,TheWire,cerhevr,2,t5_2reco

147998,0,t1_cetgj19,Based on his IMDB he does mostly singular TV episodes TV movies and straighttodvd movies. Id curious what his performances outside of The Wire are like but not curious enough to watch them. He was easily in my top  favorite characters on The Wire and played the character perfectly.

153281,0,t1_cevw017,They maybe could have left but I think the show argues through Stringer and Marlos final scenes that it was too late for them in contrast to Poot.Moreover they only got the money through the game in the first place whereas supposedly Levy couldve just become a regular attorney who didnt knowingly get involved in the drug trade. And he still wouldve been a welloff guy. Avon and Marlo didnt really have that option.,TheWire,cevw20c,5,t5_2reco
154061,1,t3_1vu42q,Considering that season five went kind of meta by looking at print media the world that Simon hailed from I wouldve liked to see season six become completely selfreferential by seeing the entertainment industry especially their gross adaptation of police work and the criminal business skewered. They could take a shot at disassembling the myth of reality television and even take a chance at selfcriticizing aspects of their own show that maybe they werent happy with or felt could be better. I could see a forcibly retired Jimmy McNulty getting swept off his feet by some Hollywood slug wanting to make a movieTV show that showed the real side of police work.Either that or to complete a picture of Baltimore somehow rope in the sports institutions. The amount of criminal activity going on in sports is something Id love to get a peek at. It would also bring the game metaphor around quite nicely.,TheWire,cevz93u,-1,t5_2reco

278586,0,t1_cf9hg1m,I understand your sentiment but I feel that aside from the usual teachers make a difference point of view that Prez was actually very successful at improving the lives of most of his students. He was able to connect with the kids and teach them despite their and the schools best efforts to make it almost impossible to teach.This was demonstrated by his frustrations about the testing curriculum and the unused books and computers. Or in how hard he tried to help Dook. When hes told that every year in every class there were going to be kids like Dook that needed his help too. Several kids in his classroom that began the year acting out were shown being productive and eager students by the end. Of course they were ancillary to the main story but I feel it is an important aspect of Prezbos storyline. Consider if instead of Prez the class was taught by someone who was burnt out or didnt care or was just inept or lazy.,TheWire,cf9mz8f,2,t5_2reco

You guys are everywhere online but whenever I mention that show in a social situation I get looks of disgust and homoerotic jokes. I went through a terrible period when I owned the first two seasons and it looked like HBO wasnt going to release the rest on DVD... then HBO got their shit together.My dad has always been a fan of mob movies and the like. I was watching HBO one lazy Sunday and their Sopranos first look aired. I caught my fathers attention and we watched the clip and then watched the first episode that night. I cant remember if Oz was on before or after but we got watching that too. Fast forward a few years and dads regular Sunday night HBO habit got him on The Wire.

3968317,0,t3_35wwmb,  All of the rampant corruption and pettiness of the drug war in homicide and major crimes pushed Jimmy over the edge.  EDIT  stuff like quick rips just to get dope on the table.  Focusing on metrics like the clearance rate over actual police work  Though its basically implied that Jimmy has issues and probably would have been a highly functioning alcoholic manwhore regardless of profession. The dude just has a grudge against authority likely stemming from his fatherson relationship.  He felt a bit under control while in the Western because he didnt have to constantly argue with his command as his job was sort of basic.  Like he said street cops are the one form of dictatorship left in America.  Jimmy felt in charge.  His sense of morality could act on impulse without being checked by others... like when he didnt bust Bodie as long as he clears the corner within a certain time frame.  He also tried to make things work with Beadie at that time and in the moment had motivation to overcome his urges to drink and fuck.   ,TheWire,cr8mef1,11,t5_2reco

4572810,0,t3_3dnh6j,Youre hitting upon the theme of the entire show.  I mean really thats what The Wire is about at its heart  there is a spectrum of good and bad and just as often the good guys who are law abiding in the eyes of the court are every bit as terrible as the people they are throwing behind bars.At its core The Wire is a stunning reminder of the human condition  What will you sell your soul for?  You can point to almost anyone in the show and they have a price.  It might not always be money but its still there.gtI just find it odd that the detectives will rely on evidence they recover after a beating and dont appear concerned that the defendant will later claim their admission was made under duress and ask for their lawyer to have it withdrawn?Which is only relevant if you have a court system that isnt looking for political leverage and a police department that isnt doing everything they can to make themselves look better to the mayor who in turn is doing everything he can to pad his resume to make a run for higher office.I think its probably with a wry grin that the series points out that often the most honest people are by no means the ones with the most power.  Often its the complete reverse.  Even when the series is selling you on how honest Carcetti is its destroying his credentials as an honest politician when he wants the crime books to be cooked.             ,TheWire,ct70gga,5,t5_2reco

4723273,0,t3_3fkzen,Here is my take on both of those. Youre right that Carcettis dogging around only took up a few minutes of screen time without seeming to add to his character. My impression is that both of your reasons are correct upon winning the election Carcetti had lofty goals many of which he would later betray but part of the point of declining Terry was to show that he was really buying into his own ideals at least for a time. But I also suspect that was the beginning of Carcetti really thinking like a politician declining an affair so as to minimize the risk of a bad headline. Ultimately Carcetti the politician would win out over Carcetti the paragon whether this was due to a personal flaw unique to Carcetti or due to a system that grinds the ideals out of the people who rise to power is another question. Declining Terrys advances I think served to show the emergence of both Carcettis ideals and his political sense whereas when he was just a city councilman he could be more careless and indulgent.. Herc... is a simpler character. At pretty much any point in time Herc is going to do whatever covers his own ass and helps him to get ahead which in Levys employ meant that he was bound to help Levy even to the detriment of his friends and former friends in the department. From a storytelling standpoint the reason for not making a big deal out of it might have been to show that sometimes the things that really hold back progress in the world are not widely reported scandals or mistakes but instead the discreet selfserving actions of a misguided individual. Anyone in the general public or even in the department who hears about the collapse and nottoosatisfying ending of the Stanfield case is going to assume it stalled out for one grand reason or another like witnesses being intimidated rather than something so simple as Hercs betrayal behind closed doors.Of course Herc screwing up the investigation seems like a total downer but its worth remembering that at the end of the series Marlo had money and freedom but no reputation nor did he have the ability to leave the game behind which in turn almost guarantees his eventual downfall.,TheWire,ctpwpda,4,t5_2reco

The styles are completely different if it were like The Wire it would spend an entire season on the mid s focus on the paisanos and the poor boys in Medellin who would become the sicarios have more faces in the DEA more members of the Search Bloc more members of the inner workings of the corrupt politicians the politicians who are both fighting against Pablo and at the same time just trying not to be killed the difficulty of being anything in Colombia the sympathetic middle man of the cartels who again knows only this also delving into the deeper history of Colombia and why it allowed these cartels to gain so much power. I.e. talk about La Violencia the struggle between the state i.e. civilization and the untouched jungles i.e. the nature and how it allows for leftist guerrillas and these cartels to take root and act as a de facto government. Also you would see how the United States foreign policy affects the drug trade although the show touches upon this it would go deeper if it were The Wire.

There are a few from the Baltimore Sun story that I wasnt particularly impressed by such as Alma and Scott.  Templeton was played so blankly and with such a lack of scruples that I just couldnt get on board with how he was being portrayed and Alma...I just didnt think she was a good actor.

But its not very interesting to dissect that much further.I think he was closer to becoming good police than everyone gave him credit for though. He really learned a lot in S to the point that he was lecturing younger cops in the Western about good policing. But without further reinforcement he slid into old habits quickly.And worse yet when he rejoined the major case squad he was made to feel undervalued and humiliated. Now Hercs ego is ridiculously fragile but theres something to his grievance. Moreover his exaggerated reaction is emblematic of the structural problem the system created guys like him and gave them a position of authority. If you take that all away and dont find a place for them in your reformed system theyre going to be pushing back against it.At root Herc enjoyed being a bigshot. He was the police equivalent of the corner kids that wanted to show their toughness. That alone isnt the worst character flaw you could have until taken to an extreme. Herc could have fit into a role of tough but fair cop if there were a role like that to fill and enough leadership to guide him there. ,TheWire,cx2jdko,5,t5_2reco

I think his writing actually got more stable as the show went on but at the start you could really tell he was a sneaky sausage whereas in the books he seems kind of ambiguous at the start. At the end of the books hes still somewhat ambiguous in the sense that you cant tell whose side hes on is he serving himself or does he actually care for Sansa? whereas the same isnt true in the books knowingly gives her to the Boltons all like glhf lol. The latter difference in ambiguity is due to writing. At the start of the show though its a bit too obvious that hes a schemer.

Also you take a very condescending tone when were discussing a silly tv show... I digress. I dont mind season  but I think it is the weakest of the series. I could see someone arguing season  being the weakest for the whole farfetched serial killer thing but what saves it for me is the way the lives  of the kids start to fall into the mold of existing characters. Season two feels a little lacking compared to the other seasons as if it couldve used another rewrite because only  of the idea was finished. Frank is one of my favorite characters in the series but I feel like the Greek and Br. Mouzone are far fetched and over the top I could see either of them in Law amp Order or another cliche cop show.

Even if he didnt see the walls closing in we did. Eventually admired him for being honest whimself and others bleeding redWas a perfect cast choice for the character. Stringer Tbh NOT a huge Idris fan. Did well enough in the part but never really bought him as a college going drug king pin. Did not carry the seasons alone well when Avon was on ice.Grew to resent his quickness to dispose of anyone in his way while never doing it himself. He didnt seem to give Bodie or other deserving soldiers their due. Really really glad they didnt go the safe route and keep Stringers at character around longer. The timing was right.Both incredibly fleshed out characters making a dynamic pair that worked off each other very well. Characters later appreciated Slim Charles much of the Barksdale muscle from slike Bird Savino and Stinkum Landsman Rawls from dicks wmisaligned motivationsgthilarious dicks.

It has become a vehicle to pit two opposing political perspectives and merge them into a gameshow format.Within two generations we went from cultural respect for media institutions such as newspapers for taking down a crooked presidential regime to now having complete distrust of them.

10902548,0,t3_5vrkk9,If a connection with the characters is the aspect youre looking for that would likely grow if you watch fhe subsequent seasons. With a large cast and the focus on the city and institutions more than the individuals experiences and situation identifying with and learning the personalities can be diluted over the short term but does accumulate on the long run. And there are several to enjoy and appreciate with the list of those usually growing during rewatches. Unfortunately Season  wont suddenly make this apparent for you as it takes a bit of a tangent and introduces more characters significantly reducing screen time for many youve been introduced to though these will return and grow. I cant stress enough that from my perspective The Wire is a cumulative work the series is best appreciated as a whole.  While seasons have their own identities and focus they interconnect build and blend to achieve the masterpiece. Its not about outstanding episodes its the combination. All the pieces matter.

10960121,0,t1_de9tvlb,I feel like there are a few instances of the show where characters are introduced one way then David Simon changed his mind and went a different direction.  Prop Joe is one of them.  Omar is another.These instances just stand out in my mind because almost every other character is quite well established right from their first scene.,TheWire,deagj51,3,t5_2reco

10983700,0,t3_5wsfpp,I absolutely love peoples opinions on the seasons. They are all great I agree and hate that one has to be last but Id put them as  .I really enjoyed season  bc I enjoyed the newsroom story more than most people. The growing lies of Scott and suspicions from Gus in a professional setting was relatable to me. The season felt tense from the beginning yet was light from the humor. A mix that makes it very enjoyable to watch repeatedly.  Season  was amazing just a little less so for me than the others. I appreciated the effort to expand the scope and introduce new characters such an ambitious season no doubt about that. Was it more enjoyable on your second go around than the first?,TheWire,decyuc3,2,t5_2reco

11160172,0,t1_dewxpz4,I think this is the right answer.  First movie is Season  until right before Avon gets out of jail probably would skip the dock storyline and focus on the streets.  Second film is the Barksdale vs Stanfield war and Hamsterdam.  Third film is the kids storyline  homeless serial killer.,TheWire,dewzrxv,3,t5_2reco
11193004,0,t1_df0nd8b,I had the same issue. But it is a good show. I forget what channel Homicide was on but it was a cable show not HBO. Richard Belzer was in it and he plays the same detective on Law amp Order SVU. They talk about how he used to be Baltimore homicide.,TheWire,df0pphv,1,t5_2reco

11371351,0,t3_629nia,Its a very different type of show but Id recommend The Good Wife.  At least the first few seasons.  The showrunners are huge fans of The Wire and Im pretty sure they made it their mission to cast as many Wire alumnis as they possibly could in small roles.  Most of the appearances are in the first few seasons.And its a pretty good show in general if you like lawyer dramas.,TheWire,dfkx6lk,2,t5_2reco
11401991,0,t3_62pv7w,Between the two i choose the detail. Frankly I would help Dee Wallace bubbles to get out of the game. Also i prevent Brandon from getting murder kima from getting shot. I make basically an ABC  cop show. ,TheWire,dfoegph,31,t5_2reco
11411101,0,t1_dfoxhor,What I have in mind is very simple as an affluent society the politician should realize they have the responsibility to take care of the kids who are born into poor families gave them proper education and mentoring so that they dont end up on streets selling drugs.,TheWire,dfpfpmx,3,t5_2reco
11463204,0,t3_63b8tm,To set up for season . I personally think it has nothing to do with filming schedule as you can already see them laying the ground work with foreshadowing in Season .Remember that conversation he had with Lester on a weekend when he was bragging about how they were probably the finest of the Baltimore and Lester told him that all cases end and you need to find a life outside of this policing shit.McNulty realizes this and in Season  he takes a back seat and becomes a regular patrol in the Western but lots of things were happening with him off the screen relationship with Beadie and that one scene when he was hanging out with Bunk and Elena shows up even shows that he may be in a better place in terms of relationship than Elena was with the lawyer.This all sets up for end of season  and you will quickly realize what the message is about politician and IMO it is a powerful way to send this message. ,TheWire,dfvci84,3,t5_2reco

11783454,0,t1_dgvolo7,I think it does explore relationships between institutionsindividuals in that it explores how incarceration affects employment opportunities going forward and how the community is affected by policies of the war on drugs and by the drugs themselves. As someone pointed out its probably more like a prequel than sequel and really theres no continuation of the specific story lines of The Wire. But it sure does feel like an extension of the show.,TheWire,dgvoy97,2,t5_2reco
