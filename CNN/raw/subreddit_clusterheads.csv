371719,0,t3_1ycbn1,The amount may vary person to person but Im pretty sure with  grams youd be not only talking to god youd be developing the concept of looping All gods ever. Cluster busters is a good resource for dosages. I believe they even have suggestions of how to bust properly and things to void taking before trying to bustdose. There should be a link in the sidebar. Sorry to hear about the recurrences though. We all feel your pain. Internet hug.,clusterheads,cfjalf4,1,t5_2sk0k

1474727,0,t1_cj14ia9,Take around  grams.  Mushrooms are not like LSD.  You wont be out of your mind  and you wont see things that are not there.  Its a body high and a mental high.  Youll feel anxious andor nauseous when they start to take effect.  Youll be FINE. Put on some cartoons or some nice music.  Youll figure out what you like when you are on them.  They can abort an attack but they main reason for using them is that the attacks go away for months at a time.  Oxygen gets you high and relaxes you.  This is a very different high.,clusterheads,cj14rfr,1,t5_2sk0k
1920542,0,t1_ckkd9ki,I also tried a ergotamine when I first got clusters because they worked for my dad. They made me deathly nauseated and when I took them not only was I in excruciating pain but I was also vomiting ,clusterheads,ckkm1h5,2,t5_2sk0k
1921535,0,t3_2gj95f,Im one of the lucky ones in that I was diagnosed quickly and quickly found an effective treatment. I get just one or two attacks a day four is my record during episodic cycles lasting up to six months with remissions of one to four years in between. The cycles come on slowly with lots of shadows before the big Beast hits so I have plenty of time to get ready. Alcohol is a trigger as are overheated environments. Specific characteristics of the cycles and attacks vary every time the Beast comes around. Soon after I was diagnosed I stumbled upon clusterheadaces.com  and the folks who later became the Clusterbusters  Check out their message board  Tried psilocybin mushrooms with amazing results and later switched to rivea corymbosa seeds easier to get for an old fart with slightly less amazing results. Weekly subhallucinogenic doses reduce attacks by  percent.  Breakthroughs I handle with cold  reducing the body temperature by chugging a full quart of cold water going outside coatless in the winter jamming my eye against the air conditioner vent etc. Sometimes this works sometimes it doesnt. ,clusterheads,ckkqc40,1,t5_2sk0k

2178452,0,t1_clge052, Headache usually starts in the morning and lasts for two hours minimum goes away for a few hours then comes back. Probably three or four. It always hurts on the right side of my head and only the right side of my head. It also also hurts the most directly behind my eye.  My nose always starts running a day or two before I get the headache. Before my first attack last month I thought it was fall allergies. When I woke up at the hospital they asked me about that and they said that was a symptom. Plus my right eye was watering constantly which I also thought was an allergy thing. I cant stay still when I get this headache. Ive had migraines for my entire life and whenever I would get one I would lay down with an ice pack and it would take care of itself. But when this headache came back on Sunday I had to get up and walk around the house. If I sat or laid down I found it got worse. Just blurry vision which also happens with my migraines.I do have another appointment with my doctor to find out what else it could be thankfully. I have been grabbing energy drinks and I do find that they dull it while I have it so that helps.As for my BC Im going to see what else I can take. ,clusterheads,clgqfz0,2,t5_2sk0k
3280312,0,t1_cp25r9q,Im sorry to hear that you have to deal with that pain everyday. Does the oxygen tank work for you? Are there any other ways you find relief  when you get an attack? I cant take Sumatriptan when I was being treated for migraines Imitrex was the first medication I took and it made me feel like my throat was closing up and my shoulders felt like they were burning. Thank you for the insight. ,clusterheads,cp26kg5,1,t5_2sk0k

3756383,0,t3_3234sm,Yup. I had a cycle earlier this year and I would throw up semiregularly from the nausea. I would usually feel better shortly after within the next  minutes so as unpleasant as it was I would welcome vomiting because it was usually a sign it was almost over.,clusterheads,cqkgecx,1,t5_2sk0k
4848592,0,t1_cu5p5ww,Glad it works for you. I took less than a halfth of shrooms recently and it didnt work. In fact it seemed like my headaches were worse the week after but this could have been just me entering into a cluster and again I was still taking verapamil and imitrex which interfere with treatment. Tonight I took a very heavy dose of shrooms for me just under an th and well see if that works in the coming days even though I still am taking those medications.Were you taking any other cluster medications that might interfere? And also how much LSD is a significant dose for you?,clusterheads,cu5p8vw,1,t5_2sk0k

Unfortunately there is little research to support this so it may just be coincidence. Still Im CH free for nearly a year.

7932811,0,t3_4nwbzp,Find your nearest AirGas or other welding supply shop.  Youll probably have to purchase your first tank around  or so but after that you can exchange the empty tank for a full one for around .  The only thing you might have trouble with is getting a regulator that delivers  lpm.  Mine have all come from eBay.  Then youll just have to make sure that the tank and regulator have the same type of connectors there are  different types so I bought  regulators  one of each just to be sure.From what Ive been told there is no difference between medical oxygen and welding oxygen.   is .  The only difference is that welding tanks are just refilled once theyre empty whereas with medical tanks they pull a vacuum on the tank prior to refilling.  YMMV but I have used welding  exclusively for years and have never had a problem.,clusterheads,d47q0ym,3,t5_2sk0k

Yes it is very important to communicate to your employer and school they have to make accommodations within reason.However I think its also important to educate yourself and get your treatments right to minimize or eliminate your attacks. There are plenty of options out there. If you are currently on a medication protocol and still getting attacks then it isnt working.,clusterheads,d8fgp8k,1,t5_2sk0k

I also have migraines from time to time which Made it difficult for several doctors to give me an specific diagnosis cluster back when I started having them. Last time I read and articule about it I think it was a  year time lapse for people with clusters until a doctor gives the right diagnosis mainly because of what you wrote MD grouping it as a migraine.You can always get a second opinin.,clusterheads,dfdo5uj,2,t5_2sk0k

When they arrive take  of them grind them up in a coffee grinder or food processor. Soak in ozoz of distilled water or vodka for a few hours then drink it like a shot. Sleep like a baby. Then repeat again in  days.This is the best easiest and most convenient introduction into tryptamines. They are our  treatment.,clusterheads,dfieg7f,3,t5_2sk0k
