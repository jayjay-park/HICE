9726057,0,t1_dabaq4g,If it comes down to that I usually wait until I die anyways then do a quick hero swap then swap back to clear it from the world and reset my ult.This also works with the new shield generator! Which is handy considering the only other way to get rid of it is to have someone kill it.,SymmetraMains,daby7jl,1,t5_3el72
9730489,0,t1_dabode0,A k shield that can block a bunch of ultsprojectiles is gonna save your teammates more than a  hp boost. Youll just have to learn how to use it properly. I can see that the shield generator will make more sense than a teleporter on many maps where your spawn is basically next to a point,SymmetraMains,dachu5n,1,t5_3el72

9989900,0,t3_5ie9md,If they dont have a flanker tracer genji etc I usually put it in the back somewhere. If they do have a flanker then Ill put it close to the point so at least the team might be able to do something.,SymmetraMains,db9pmkw,1,t5_3el72
10024123,0,t1_dbe3oeu,See thats what Ive been thinking the whole time while watching your gameplay as well as playing her myself. Most coordinated teams will see you sneak off but if your team is coordinated as well youll be able to pull off aggressive Symmetra plays like this. I kinda see this style of play akin to uDSPStanky in his aggressive Lucio. Not many people play him that way and yet it is very effective if done right.By done right I mean wait until a team fight save your ults and wait for them to use theirs to wipe your team. Then go sneak off while this is happening and pull off a team flank. And...actually being a team leader would help you solidify this plan into action.,SymmetraMains,dbe6671,1,t5_3el72
10048348,0,t3_5jln4g,I used Devi for the longest time then Vampire came out and I never looked back. That skin with the notion that her death ray actually absorbs the life force of her enemies solidifies her overall aesthetic for me. Although I would like to see a few more skins in the near future. If I had to choose out of those two though I would go for goddess because she is! ,SymmetraMains,dbhbq3t,5,t5_3el72
10086600,0,t3_5jtw3h,I understand what you mean as with the shield generator going up until it dies it can last an entire match so you basically gain ultimate charge once and thats it. That being said the new barrier takes some getting used to but is very helpful and you can use it to save some teammates from things you couldnt save them from before! Last match I saved a stranded Zenyatta from a D.Va ult going off right in his face! Just got to get used to it!,SymmetraMains,dbmavm9,1,t5_3el72
10090556,0,t3_5k6we2,I was thinking about doing the same thing. I dont know if i want to go through with it though. Any information will be appreciated whether i should do it or not.,SymmetraMains,dbmte0s,1,t5_3el72

10609352,0,t3_5rtp92,sym can help with a dive comp. on attack shes fantastic and on defense you have to adjust  you have to spread out along the path from the choke to the point hoping to chip away and charge your ult as they push through. a nest at teh choke will only slow one down at a time so it wont work and the team will wipe them out. stagger them along the path of the dive and the enemy will be hopefully focused on your allies so your turrets will last a little longer and be more effective. then by the time they get to the choke you either have your ult or can put more sentries up to support your team if they survived the dive.spreading out is key to defending a dive.,SymmetraMains,dda9uvp,5,t5_3el72

11135546,0,t3_5yxze0,Make beam make more severe line of sight checks the longer it is so its easier to break at long ranges it IS a bit bullshit that we can get sneaky damage in around corners when someone gets away they should actually get away. Makes the beam more flimsy if the enemy can get distance on. Also allow teammates to see where her ult is preferably when you callout your ult to avoid constant visual clutter,SymmetraMains,deu7bsp,0,t5_3el72
11553238,0,t3_64w0xr,I cant wait to try it out this evening!!! I need to see it for myself to understand but thank you for the pointers ahead of time...basically just keep things out of sight if you dont want them destroyed. ,SymmetraMains,dg5ka7e,2,t5_3el72
