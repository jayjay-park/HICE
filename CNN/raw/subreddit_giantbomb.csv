1951488,0,t3_2gwx7j,Heya!  Your post got stuck in the filter no idea why so thats why it hasnt gotten much of a response yet.Since its probably a bit buried now Ill answer for ya! A lot of the subscriber stuff is just dumped in  without any further sorting unfortunately.Encyclopedia Bombastica      Generally older games that the crew revisits while divulging most of what they can remember of the gameseries. Largely a solo effort most of the time.TNT Thursday Night Throwdown  No specific link official link starts back around here   Former weekly multiplayerfocused show usually involved the community in some way when possible. Ryan was the one keeping it going and it hasnt seen a return since his passing.Jar Time with Jeff  No specific link sprinkled throughout   Jeff answers random questions while drinking water out of jars.Random PC Game    Just like it sounds.Breaking Brad    Brad plays difficult games to the point of madness.  Unprofessional Fridays UPF    Weekly Friday show where the crew picks whatever game catches their fancy.Metal Gear Scanlon    Dan teaches Drew all about games with cool action movie plots for cool guys that are totally not anime.  Coffee with Patrick    Like Jar Time with Jeff but with coffee and PatrickDaily Dota    Brad plays Dota to varying levels of success and regularity.Spookin with Scoops  Patrick plays scary games.There are quite a few other shortlived series or discontinued ones in the archive but I tried to include the more recentregularnotable ones.  Like I said not a lot of great sorting for the subscriber stuff best thing is to just dive in and start watching everything!,giantbomb,ckocw4b,13,t5_2rlj3

Those games are why I owned capture equipment when I was  I was never the best but was always willing to help people record.

Not much going on in Destiny. I got my BoltCaster exotic sword on Wednesday. Thats pretty cool. Not sure if I really want to farm any of the other swords. That fire one is pretty neat though...Oh and got the Sleep Simulant. Its extra hilarious that people went down every rabbit hole imaginable to puzzle out how to unlock that gun only to have Bungie unlock the quest randomly and have everyone complete a series of incredibly easy quests to acquire it. Bonus points as well because its kind of lame. Looks cool though.I played some of that Battlefront beta all the cool kids seem to be into. On PC though because I got that ti just sitting there mostly being used for Shadowrun Dragonfall. It almost reminds me of Titanfall in a way. Mostly because the core gameplay is engaging enough but everything around it seems a little shallow perhaps oversimplified. Its a beta I know. Heres hoping that it works out. Still not sure if its a buy for me or not. Might be some cool things there after a few expansion packs!Not much going on this weekend. Mostly on the account of bad weather here. Hope everyone has a good weekend!,giantbomb,cvtrssz,3,t5_2rlj3

5465672,0,t3_3pxief,Good afternoon fellow Spartans.I have gone all in on Halo . The Xbone has transitioned from the bedroom to the living room finally resting below my PS. Also if anyone is on Xbone and is planning to play Halo  shoot me a friend request VoxusI didnt get the collectors edition though as I did with Reach. That statue with Noble Team was so goddamn big. I welcome our all digital future so I just got the digital deluxe edition of Halo .When Im really hyped for a game and they have some collectors edition I usually buy it. Most of the time Im pretty disappointed by whatever the thing youre spending an additional  bucks on. But this all stems from the fact that I canceled my Last of Us preorder like two years ago that came with a Joel and Ellie diorama. I cant remember why I did but I still kick myself for it. Does it matter in the end? Nah probably not but still.Anyway no major plans for the weekend. I played a bit of Warhammer Vermintide. And liked what I played of it but its definitely a game Ill try to play with people I know.EDIT I finished Tales from the Borderlands. Its one of the best games Ive played all year.

QTEs in such games either need to have no gameover state and failure consequences Until Dawn Heavy Rain or just be gone entirely like LiS. Having one strong female lead and two lead female characters is commendable Im not going to call Chloe strong considering that she mostly functioned as someone to put in danger but would be better if the characters were less insufferable. Although that part is definitely just my opinion.Show me a game with a health regain mechanic similar to that of Bloodborne and then we can talk. At very least that mechanic significantly altered the gameplay from that of any previous DS making it much more aggressive and quickly paced. And this isnt even to mention its completely unique melding of western Lovecraftian themes and Japanese manga imagery.,giantbomb,cybb9ev,-1,t5_2rlj3

We have slander and libel laws in this country although not as strict as the UK for a reason. Yes we have freedom of speech and freedom of the press but most dont understand that doesnt mean you can go spout off whatever you want at all times with no repercussions. That isnt how it works. How many times have you seen a story about someone getting a article written about them at isnt true or is slanderous? Hell there was one on the front page the other day about a fabricated story about a girl dying while trying to take a selfie. Now if that girl was Taylor Swift or whatever I am sure every fact would have been triple checked but since she was a nobody they didnt care and didnt think they would get caught.My hope is that the fear of something like this happening will help keep EVERYONE in journalism a little more honest and clean.

Then Ill probably mess around with F  for a bit and probably do some of the Nuka World stuff in Fallout.Also I only have  episodes left in this season of Narcos so I gotta watch that.

10119299,0,t1_dbqjcpd,Yeah I definitely think its a weird category to have.  I wont say theres never a good reason for a remaster and Id be a huge hypocrite if they ever put out a remaster I was interested in.   If Morrowind Remastered happened Id buy that shit at full price like a moron and probably be overjoyed.  I just dont get remastering games from five or fewer years ago that were already HD and still look completely fine other than the obvious cash grab that they are.  But even then things like Skyrim and The Last of Us were supposedly done as a way of learning the new hardware so I can see a place for that too I guess but charging full price for it seems almost criminal.

The most fun Ive had so far is setting crazy goals for myself and trying to execute pun intended on them similar to the Hitsmas content. Ive found it is less fun if you dont set totally absurd goals for yourself.Hitman Roulette is a fun time.,giantbomb,deolm34,2,t5_2rlj3

11393637,0,t1_dfmtmw3,This guy himself isnt my favorite but he does a really great job at breaking down the full game and all of the novella side stories that feed into it  Fair warning he doesnt get to the good part until the start of the third video in the series which is about  minutes of content. With the exception of a couple characters backstorys and one sidequest you wont miss anything by not watching the videos but the first Nier does have a legitimately great story and the fuckery going on in both Nier and Automata is Metal Gearesque by the end. If nothing else listen to the soundtrack from the first game Kaines Salvation Song of the Ancients Devola and Popola and Grandmother are the standouts. And if you go through the videos dont forget to read a breakdown of the stage play afterwards! ,giantbomb,dfngb2z,2,t5_2rlj3
11411900,0,t3_62vjky,Not sure why youve posted this to giantbomb?But my two cents is that this film sets up the universe perfectly and it presents a lot of interesting side characters but delivers on none of it and as a stand alone film is kind of totally average and forgettable.the main story feels like a bit of a sub plot and imo Scarlett Johansson is fucking terrible. It seems a bit her fault and a bit the inconsistent writing where she is this monotone robot basically but once or twice she cracks a joke and its the fucking worst delivery ever in a way that doesnt work at all. I guess they also try to show how uncomfortable she is in her robot body yet Im pretty sure if I was in a body for a year Id be able to walk like a normal fucking human being. Although i also have those big issues with the character of the Major in the original film too.The CGI on the human characters major especially in action scenes is horribly noticeable compared to the incredible visual effects in the environment. Also Hollywood needs to stop trying to make Scarlett Johansson a bad ass action star. She just doesnt look comfortable in that kind of role imo and I cant take her seriously in a fight in the same way I can someone like Gina Carano for example.If they make a sequel hopefully they explore more of section nines squad especially Togusa who they made completely badass and just give me more Beat Takeshi and Ill be happy. ,giantbomb,dfpizpo,10,t5_2rlj3

I think I just want to see the games in action and make decisions if I want to play them or not and so I made those decisions with Beat Cop Cosmic Star Heroine and Hollow Knight. Oh and I just saw the quick look for Mr. Shifty and got that for the Switch since Id like to fill out that platform with some more games whenever possible.I also happened to watch the Giant Bomb East playdate for Tender Loving Care and it is absolutely hysterical. I would really recommend that theres currently two parts up and theyre likely going to wrap it up in a forthcoming third part. Warning though the game is erotic and theres definitely some nudity in there.gtWhat do you plan on playing this week?Going to continue with Beat Cop and start jumping into Hollow Knight. I love me some Metroivania games so I can see that eating up all my time but I would like to make some time for Mr. Shifty. Knowing me Im going to really put off Cosmic Star Heroine for later.
