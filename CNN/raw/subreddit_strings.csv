People who dont struggle have talent and thats great but regardless once you get to research level everyone needs to put hard work in and dont be afraid to admit to yourself you have a weak point just target it and fix it. While learning strings I realized I had forgotten some calculus and linear algebra topics so I sucked it up and went to the relevant sections and put the work in to understand them and filled in those weak areas.,strings,d0o7n9j,1,t5_2rfvc
