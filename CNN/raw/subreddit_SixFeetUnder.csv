2817738,0,t3_2scu9p,Thats as much info as youre going to get. I seriously doubt the writers had decided Lisa was killed by her sisters husband because she wanted to end their affair when she went missing at the end of season . It was out of character for her I agree the whole thing was strange. But the season  finale is actually one of my favorite episodes. Especially Georges nuclear bomb dream and sudden insanity and Nathaniel Sr. and Davids convo at the end. ,SixFeetUnder,cnodbsp,6,t5_2s3xw
6301555,0,t3_40lx27,For some reason I have a feeling Rico was the neglected character of the series. His death really was random and I feel like they didnt really care about him and his death. I wish they had a scene showing how every single person on the series died but when I think about it they skipped a lot of people like Billy and George so hey at least he got a scene?,SixFeetUnder,cz5wywm,1,t5_2s3xw

8051426,0,t3_4pevg4,Just finished this show yesterday from the recommendation of my girlfriend. While I didnt like it as much as she does or most other people Im one for more entertainmentless dark comedy with my life lessons. I really did appreciate how it makes you feel about grief dealing with death and that finale sweet jesus that finale it hits hard. ,SixFeetUnder,d4l20ra,1,t5_2s3xw
