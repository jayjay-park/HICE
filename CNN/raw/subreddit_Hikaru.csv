8659955,0,t3_4t153c,Hi guysAgain not sure how join up works but Id love to play with you guys as you seem pretty awesome! I play on PC STEAM and I have played around  hours on Rocket League and mostly play ranked doubles and solo standard. I would say my strength is hitting aerials and weakness probably assisting. I would love to play with anyone my level or better and get some advice as I really want to improve my game!,Hikaru,d6o3ziu,1,t5_3fh5o
8856845,0,t1_d7c0o8a,You shouldnt be sorry I am happy you took the time to help me. I am of course still practicing my aerials and was already talking with Cebion about it. He is right about the height and you even made it more clear what is the problem. I do consider this in my training and make sure to reach a better height and approach the ball. I realized the same thing keeps me from reaching the aerials before my opponents do. Thank you for explaining it. ,Hikaru,d7cgudw,1,t5_3fh5o
