138790,1,t1_ceu8305,They are different experiences just as the Windows  desktop is a different experience to Windows Phone.The Start Screen is effectively the same as LaunchPad on Mac OS except Start Screen icons can display live information as well as just start the app and its a central part of Windows as opposed to an annoyance on Mac OS.Launchpad is terrible. You cant remove apps for starters so if you go near anything that has an installer Adobe products for example your Launchpad immediately becomes a complete mess. Its much slower than using Spotlight or just clicking the Applications folder in the dock.The only time I ever see Launchpad on my MacBook is when I do the gesture by accident. I even remapped the keyboard button to go to Dashboard instead since thats marginally more useful. The Start Screen on the other hand lets me actually pin applications I use and remove those that I dont so that I can find them quickly and click them without bothering to type a search.,windows,ceu8kxq,-2,t5_2qh3k

1240824,0,t1_ci91v0p,Eh each one to their own. I understand why as well as fully agree that normal users dont have a reason to disable UAC but if an advanced user wants to disable it the choice should exist.The same situation can similarly be applied to every single security feature Microsoft have ever included in their software.The main problem though is that theres still a lot of modern software that requires elavated user rights for no apparent reason. This is obviously no fault of Microsoft but they are still common enough to compel users to disable UAC.Examples Steam is a fine example of a download client that doesnt require elavated user rights if youve installed it in a nonstandard folder outside of the Program Files folder. Every function seems to work fine except for installing prerequisite software which ask for elavated rights when needed accordingly. uPlay is a less fine example that for some reason always prompts for elavated user rights whenever I launch a game through it. I have no idea why as neither the download cache folder installation folder or uPlay itself are launched from a special folder. Origin is an example of a bad experience. Every time I login to the service it asks for elavated rights this seems to be simply because it needs to do an update check of my games. Though why it needs it even if no update is available is anyones guess. The folders themselves arent saved in a special folder ie. Program Files akin to uPlay.That said Windows  is the first OS to actually break functionality if you disable UAC due to its new deny all behaviour when disabled. This will most likely be enough for a lot of users to reenable UAC instead of jumping into the registry to do an accept all disable behaviour.Though it is a doubleedged sword in that if people are unaware of the change I myself was really surprised when I noticed it they can simply blame the broken functionality on Windows  being Windows .,windows,ci97iv2,2,t5_2qh3k

What we want is for Windows to support those on the system partition so we dont have to work using legally grey apps on Linux to mount Windows system partitions. We also want MS to officially recognize other file systems so it doesnt intentionally break apps it has happened before.Anyway we expect MS to completely ignore most of this list and focus on only a handful of things so were trying to make noise and see how much noise other users are making about other features and well see what sticks. We know its unreasonable to expect MS to support everything under the sun so were working on a consensus of demands. And whats the problem if OP is obsessed with focus stealing?

Digital River official Windows  iso doesnt have the right opensourceMicrosoft file systems installed to work with Microsofts tool for making a DVD.  So added UDFJoliet under properties in PowerIso.  This worked.  Then no amount of bios changes and installing drivers within the install could get SATA working to get the install to start until I threw a hail mary and installed a  version of Windows  off a torrent on to the USB and ran that.    The torrented Windows install hung at the last step and the workaround is apparently to open explorer in the cmd and watch it try to finish the install until it restarts.  If it doesnt restart it didnt and is hung up again restart with the power button and hope it finishes without error.  If you get an error I did the workaround is to open cmd and edit a registry entry.  This worked and after hours of messing around with the thing and trying a dozen other workarounds I completed my reinstallation of Windows  on a three year old computer.Just ranting...I cant wrap my head around how there wasnt a single step in a common process that didnt require specialized software torrent files or cmd line fuckery...Im not an IT professional but how do normal people get this accomplished?  How does Microsoft have a single source for ISO files for everyone who didnt get a disk or make a recovery disk which doesnt work with their own damn tool for putting it on a DVD or USB?  Why does the  version of Windows  contain SATA drivers the latest version lacks?  Why do you have to change a  to a  in a system file from the cmd line to complete an install?  This is on a consumer hp box nothing weird or fancy...  ,windows,co9k26v,1,t5_2qh3k

3047863,0,t3_2v27yh,So it sounds like you just need to boot from a USB to your new SSD. For your HDD I would suggest depending on how much data you actually have transferring all of your files to the SSD or an external HDD. After that you can just reformat and then stick it in your new computer to use as mass storage pictures videos music etc since your SSD is only GB. Might be big enough for you but thats just me. Find your windows key! If your computer is a prebuilt there should be a sticker on it somewhere. Look really hard for it because you can use Software to recover it but it might not be  accurate. But you can also use said software to recover things like office keys too. Make sure to keep track of other licensed software as well and any settings you might loseplaylists made me cry when I reformatted too soon. ELI Get a thumb drive. Download Rufus and also download Windows ISOs just MAKE SURE TO SELECT THE RIGHT VERSION OF WINDOWS. YOUR CD KEY WILL ONLY WORK WITH THE VERSION IT WAS DESIGNED FOR AND ORIGINALLY PAIRED WITH. You cannot use a Home Professional key for a Windows Ultimate installation. Use rufus to create a bootable thumb drive. Now construct your new computer and boot from the thumb drive make sure in the BIOSUEFI that the boot order is set to give USB priority over HDDSSD. Windows setup should begin install windows to the new SSD. Now transfer everything from HDD to SSD or external HDD and once youre sure everything is transferred you can use windows to reformat your HDD then move your media back to it or use it however you wish.Good luck!,windows,codwrvv,1,t5_2qh3k

3326693,0,t3_2y8xo5,I switched from Windows as my main OS almost four years ago now. At first I had your issues but soon over came or ignored them. I was too a heavy rainmeter user and loved theming and throwing screenshots and zips with my themes on DeviantArt. Conky a Linux equivalent that is pretty great. As far a media players I was a huge Foobar user but found a home with deadbeef. Obviously these programs have trade offs compared to windows software but they also have there benefits.I distro hopped switch versions for first  years I switched. I would find weird bugs or glitches that one distro with would perfect but had its own bugs. Ill agree with you that drivers sometimes suck for newer hardware. My  year old Lenovo laptop has two Nvidia graphics cards in sli... Dont get me started on sli on mobile GPUs. For the longest time I hated the different versions and forks user make of software. I never new what was still developed or why to use one of the other I was lost. I also hate home everything just works on windows while somethings need to be configured on Linux.All of this considered I love Linux. After using windows since I was a young kid I have grown to love finding small things windows does better then Linux and vice versa. I work helpdesk for my university so I get to work on Macs too. Interesting to compare the top three OSs technically the kernel is the OS. I love that almost every part of a distro lets you change it or replace it with something else. I personally love the ability have stable or testing branches of software I love how light and quick it is compared to windows In m usage.I would say if your more comfortable on Windows thats okay. At least you tried it and had fun. I still use Windows at work and its great for what I need it too. Linux on my computer at home does everything I need it to do at home.

4199285,0,t1_crywfsl,Bought a laptop off them that has broke four times. They repaired it the first but their collection system is archaic compared to other companies I have dealt with. Waited a week for a letter. Then had to call a courier company which only runs phonelines MonFri from  to . Had to take a day off waiting for said courier company. They took the laptop and then it was two weeks. Never heard from Lenovo other than an automated message to say it had been received. Spent ages trying to get through for them to tell me that it had already been spent back even though I hadnt been told of a return date. I could have missed it without ever knowing. Second time the guy on the phone told me to press the reset button but I didnt know what said button did beforehand and they didnt warn me that it would reset my computer. If it wasnt for a backup Id have lost everything. Then after that the guy just hung up before I could ask anything.It broke again yesterday. This is thd fourth time it has broke and the second time with this same issue. Ive had two accounts of what complete circuitry cutouts one account of HDD failure and a broken trackpad too. The build quality is abysmal. Its almost the price of a Macbook but worse than a  Acer I had before. The keyboard flexes the fans are noisy the screen has poor black levels  and has no viewing angles whatsoever. It came preloaded with Lenovo crap that spies on your usage to provide customer tailoring and custom power software that could lock an unknowing user completely out of their PC.

4212102,0,t1_cs0bpqx,Lets look at whats been said so far.gtUh yeah. Thats one of my major pet peeves with the  OS. I may not give up my Windows  because of it.I replied that Windows isnt done specifically the part of the OS youre annoyed about so you should be patient instead of overreacting to a transitory issue in a beta.Heres what you said in replygtIm hoping youre right. Youre probably right. I wonder though if they might be saving features for when Windows becomes a service to justify people getting subscriptions.Which to me isnt a suspicion worth worrying about because of a couple reasons.. The issue youre worrying about is UI whichll be fixed by launch.  They wouldnt hold back such a basic element of the OS for a potential Windowssubscription service.  Theyre going to put it in immediately at launch like I just said.  Holding back features from an update doesnt make any sense given what we know about the Windows dev cycle.  They dont have Windows features just sitting around ready to go and with the major PR push theyre making lately they want Windows to be as good as it can be as soon as it can be.  Besides since theyve acknowledged theyll be updating the OS very rapidly keeping the Insiders Program going it wouldnt make sense to hold the new features back from the public testers.  A subscription model for Windows licensing is as far as the world really knows even considering your evidence there are no plans to provide subscriptions to Windows in this coming version or in the next.Lets look at the Forbes article that your link uses as a source.  What they describe as a subscription model isnt a subscription model at all.  Following its claim that Windows  will be the last Windows because they think it implies that Windows is going to become a service through the linked sources to figure out why they think this we get to this clickbait article wherein they like many other sites picked up a passing sentence from a developer evangelist.  This sentiment echoed by the evangelist and also numerous other employees that Windows  is going to be the last version of Windows does not indicate that theyre moving to a subscription model as the Forbes articles writer wrongly concludes.  It means that theyre just going to move to an agile updating schedule as opposed to sticking with service packs and big Windows releases.  That is what WaaS is.  The author of that article made a mistake when he suggested this is a subscription service  its not a subscription in the sense that youre paying for the license on a schedule as you use it.  Nobody has any sort of quote that directly suggests this is the case.This Verge article explains the meaning behind the quote from the evangelist.Look here  Newegg clearly expects pricing to be done in the usual way for Windows .  They certainly arent gearing up to switch to the subscription model this time around and we have no real information which suggests theyre looking to switch to the subscription model later.This article by noted Microsoft journalist Paul Thurrott explains why the article you linked doesnt argue successfully for the idea that Microsoft is transferring Windows to the subscription licensing model.gtThe reason anyone is talking like this is that Microsoft is pushing a Windows as a service vision which doesnt mean subscription service but rather that it plans to upgrade Windows  going forward with both functional and security updates plus of course bug fixes.And so you have no ground to speculate on the likelihood of a subscription version of Windows.  Your original complaint isnt going to be a problem in a month or two the secondary complaint has nothing to do with the first the secondary complaint also isnt reasonable and this fearmongering has got to stop.  If you want to talk about how bad a subscription would be then sure voice your opinion but dont rely upon the fear of the eventuality to capture attention like those shifty Forbes articles.  Dont talk about it like its likely when in reality its not even on the table at the moment that would be spreading misinformation.Finally look if you think Microsoft is holding back features then sure think that.  Have your completely unfounded opinion but dude dont pass it off as the fact of the matter or even as a possible situation if you dont have any real proof other than a weird unreasonable skepticism that comes with a lack of familiarity with the facts of the matter.,windows,cs0d6lm,1,t5_2qh3k

This will allow you to write lines of code just like in an empty .txt file.The code for simple things is pretty easy. I think someone posted their code for keyboard shortcuts elsewhere in this thread. If theres anything you want to do just google something like AutoHotKey syntax for ltkeyboard remapping keyboard shortcuts etcgt and youll find the code to put in your file.Once you have the appropriate code in your .ahk file which is in the startup folder the code will execute on its own every time you start your computer and whatever you have written will come true like magic.Also to note you can manually run a .ahk file by simply double clicking it.,windows,csiw1vd,1,t5_2qh3k

Its less useful than it might otherwise be though.If it were up to me allowing a straight passthrough of the HDMI when streaming is going on would be fine. I want the streaming so I can play Xbox One games with my friends without having to go downstairs and disturb my wife while shes watching a show in the evening. Honestly shes annoyed when interfaces change anyway so I may just disconnect the Xbox from the cable box entirely before the Windows  update.  Then on the rare occasion I want to game down there I can just switch which input the TV is using. The other useful fix Id like them to implement is a way to wake the Xbox One over the LAN for streaming purposes.

Anyway theres only so much you can do with bit monochrome but for whatever reason the Apple machines just looked better than many many of the PCs and that came with a cost.

5078255,0,t1_cuy323q,VB Audio VoiceMeter VAIO  Desktop audio by default normally you set this as default playback in windowsVB Audio VoiceMeter AUX VAIO  Desktop audio you want to split from the rest of the desktop audio. For example VLC MusicBee Skype. This way whatever plays through the AUX channel is split from the main desktop audio game audio etc. As youve pointed out though it requires a program that allows you to specify which playback device the programs audio uses. In the case of skype for example you would set skype to use VB Audio VoiceMeter AUX VAIO for speakers. This way your skype conversation doesnt go into the main desktop audio channel. You can use the A A A to toggle which Master Output the AUX channel is output. So If HDMI is A and you only want desktop audio out of A then your Desktop channel should have A toggled on. BUT you dont want the AUX audio to come through HDMI so you toggle OFF A on the AUX channel. This is the general idea. Im just trying to illustrate how you use the VB Audio VoiceMeter VAIO and VB Audio VoiceMeter AUX VAIO to split desktop audio from a specific applications audio and output it.So the VB Audio VoiceMeter VAIO and VB Audio VoiceMeter AUX VAIO are virtual audio cables used for playback splitting. The AUX is typically the channel you use to for the split audio you define in your program to use while the other is for Default playback.The inputs have a similar kind of setup as well btw for recording. And you will notice in the master section there is B and B. These are Virtual that you can use as your Mic inputs in Skype for example if you want wanted to play Music from VLC into your skype chat. You would do this by using AUX Playblack as VLC output then toggle on B in the AUX channel and in Skype you use VoiceMeter Output VAIO as the microphone input. Now you can play Music through VLC or musicbee into your skype chat and annoy people  You can TOGGLE it off now because of how you set it up by simply toggling off B in the AUX channel. Or lets say you had  Mics and  people talking and you wanted that all to mix into Skype. You set Skype to use VoiceMeter Output VAIO as microphone then in VM you set  mics as the  inputs and make sure they all have B toggled on. This way they all mix into the virtual B channel. Now you have all  mics as your input for Skype.Does that make sense?Now you can get even fancier with VM because each channel has an ASIO PATCH that can splice into each of the channel so you can pipe your mic audio through Adobe Audition and set Audition to use VoiceMeter ASIO Insert... and this will automatically splice into the audio channels. You can direct where this patches is in the VM settings. This isnt helpful for what youre trying to do right now but im just mentioning it because its a very powerful feature that is extremely useful. But you dont have to use it or worry about it until you get your basic pathing the way you like it. It can always be patched in after which is nice. What this does is basically anytime you load adobe audition it automatically patches over the mic input for example and loops your mic input through audition then audition processes the audio to make your voice sound great and sends it right back into VM and through your VM setup. Its very nice. Anyways its a bit more complex but something to keep in mind. The docs help explain this a bit but it takes a bit of tinkering to really understand how the ui works in VM for this but I figured i would mention it because it may help make more sense when you read about this section in the docs.,windows,cuy4e38,1,t5_2qh3k

After TweetDeck I tried out Tweetro and then Tweetro for a while but the developer kind of disappeared. Updates new features and fixes all stopped rather abruptly. Thats when I tried out Tweetium. Ive had it for I want to say about a year and a half now and its still getting updated with fixes and new features. The developers are also super friendly and will try to work with you to fix issues either something you can change or something theyll recognize as a bug and fix in an update.Ive tried using the official Twitter .x app but its so annoyingly barebones compared to Tweetium. The official app also stopped letting me retweet things after I enabled twostep authentication on my work Twitter.Netflix I just like the ease of pulling up the client compared to the web experience. This probably has a lot to do with the fact that I also am used to the stand alone client on my PS.Other than these two I have the usual Solitaire Mahjong and Jigsaw games from Microsoft even with the sometimes annoying ads.

You only get one school login but you have to have a different account to install the real Office on your computer.  I eventually figured it out but its weird.  I have the same login name for two or three different accounts but different passwords and theyre somehow linked by the University.  Dont ask me.  I cant use the same skydrive on my ipad and my computer.  I can however use Excel on both and with the same login and password.  Thats how weird it is.  But anyway yeah...Access is a must.  I do a lot of consulting and need that.  Would pay for it if I had to but would rather not since I gave that school a shit ton of money.  I figure I deserve Office from them.

I have been in that situation with foreign laptops trying to fix them before. I see below you deleted the partition. Are you restoring from a recovery partition? or a disk or usb drive. The reason i am asking is that a disk or usb drive may not have drivers for your machine. So reading between the lines when you say the laptop is messed up could it be you just dont have correct drivers installed so things look weird?Any application would have to be reinstalled. Repeatedly reinstalling the OS is not a great idea wont get you anywhere. Go to the manufacturers website hp dell asus etc and download the correct drivers for the machine then apply them right after you reinstall windows fresh. If its an OEM machine ie someone built it for you then take it back to them to fix it is the easiest way. Otherwise you have to look for drivers for everything in the PC which takes some skill sometimes.Even the spanish language problem isnt that big of a deal. Your CD key will probably work with the english version too. You just need an english ISO disk image file which you can download from the internet kickass torrents probably has one. then just download a program called RUFUS and burn the ISO to a USB stick. or make a dvd if you are more comfortable with that.If you have a recovery partition then it shouldnt be in spanish. But i question now do you have two copies of windows? one that came with the machine not in spanish and one someone bought for you?a hard drive failure on a brand new machine its extremely unlikely. but im not sure how old it is re reading your description.

Same issue exist on AMD setups if youre wondering.gt I did a bunch of research on this one last night. Long and short of it is its a false error. Microsoft is expecting their dll NVidias dll can should and generally does take precedence. If you want to triple check find the files that its reporting as an error. If the file is over k its NVidias version and everything is okay but sfc scannow will continue to generate an error until MS addresses the issue. If the file is approximately k then Microsofts version is in place and you should reinstall your Nvidia drivers but then if MSs version is in place you probably didnt get the sfc scannow error and wouldnt know about this in the first place.,windows,d0xn1e1,7,t5_2qh3k

Look at how aggressively theyve been pushing Windows  upgrades.There may be some expensive paid support like with with XP. Also maybe some hack can be used to receive updates like with XP PosReady. Microsoft certainly isnt going to extend free support.Support from rd parties would be hard because Windows is closed source. You cant simply fix a security hole in the source code and recompile unless you actually have the source. Microsoft would have to license the source to a rd party for that and that wont happen.,windows,d4527vp,2,t5_2qh3k

In what situations would you use it? ref    AVI is a container it can contain data from lossless and lossy encoding.   You skip the best way to avoid high CPU usage using a hardware encoder.

If they would have had the sense to make the KinectBox like the Amazon Echo with custom commands and opened the API to the TVNetFlixAmazonHulu listings video recording DVR type stuff other services snapped apps for games connected devices throughout the home Nest Hue etc etc  then it could have been revolutionary.    They built a revolutionary device that could have singlehandedly sold Universal Apps as gamechanging stuff.......and then did nothing with it.   So is there potential right now...going forward?

While the Retail version can be freely moved to new hardware as long as its only installed on one computer at the time.

So no real instruments here. Some might even say that no real music here haha.I just wonder how it worked for you before because for me it blocked every other sound source everytime I used ASIO until I closed the DAW. This is the whole purpose of ASIO as you want the sound to be bitperfect so it disables the Windows mixer completely and puts the sound straigtly to the soundcard  interface. Although Windows  now handles latencies pretty good and I can actually produce using DirectSound without having pops and crackles this wasnt possible on  and ..The glitch is actually happening on my Xonar Essence STX because of the Xonar incompatibilities with Windows    its either a driver or Windows issue. I read that its an issue inside Windows audio stack but Im not sure because no other cards have made the same glitch I had a Creative XFi USB card earlier. This is why I thought about buying the Scarlett and ditching this soundcard.Can you get any sound from the Scarlett even if you reboot your PC and dont open Cubase after that or is it locked all the time? Maybe you could try to produce using DirectSound. Also you could try to completely disable the internal soundcard from BIOS and see if that makes any difference.,windows,dc145jk,2,t5_2qh3k

Unfortunately they have forgotten that not everyone is the same and demand that the window is  consecutive hours.Meaning if I regularly use my PC at am and pm Ill have to put up with forced reboots at some point.

Now a virus or malware can have multiple infection vectors program an email attachment etc... so while using an unprivileged account surely helps I wouldnt use Windows without an AV I prefer Avira because its quite light on resources.Linux is a different story. Being highly compartmentalized by defaults makes it a bit difficult for a virus to make real damage.

It doesnt update through a package manager like desktop Linux distros instead you get a system image thats flashed over the previous system.During the change from Dalvik to Android RuntimeART . to . they changed their compiler from JIT Justintime to AOTAheadoftime which gives better performance but they didnt have monthly security patches in mind when they made that change as they didnt exist back then. So from Lollipop until Nougat every time you updated your phone it would recompile every single app before booting the system after an update. Obviously this isnt practical if you plan on updating monthly so on Nougat they decided to use both JIT and AOT compilers for when you install an app. It does JIT and analyses what they can optimize later doing AOT only on things that can benefit from it and while the phone is doing nothing often when it is charging. Besides that they also implemented a dual system partition model similar to the ChromeOS one to make updates seamlessly as possible but thats only available on newer phones like the Google Pixel where Nougat is available day .,windows,deg1bz2,3,t5_2qh3k

11371918,0,t3_623a56,The easy answer is because is easy for the developers to mantain software if only one version of the OS exist. Microsoft is not the only one that uses this model every development company do this being OS or app development companies. Whatsapp doesnt support older versions of android. Even Apple doesnt support its older hardware. Imagine this If you develop an app youll develop in your PC so your app will work for your OS lets say windows . Now your app has an incredible success but it doesnt work in windows  or . Youll risk losing clients? Simply no. Youll change it to work in  OS. Youll need to test it in  OS be PCs or VMs. Now you find a bug and need to fix it. First you fix it and now it works in your PC but you need to test it in the other two OS!!!Now imagine maintain a OS like windows. You need to maintain compatibility not only for your current version of hardware Video cards processors mother board etc... What would you chose drop support for and older OS version or pay twice the number of developers to support the old and new versions?. Dont even try to mention Linux here as Linux is maintained not by a company but a legion of developers around the world payed by a company or hobytists.Now for the Hacks and scare tactics those are not tactis from them but instead a reality. Since XP died there are no patches for every new vulnerabilty discovered. And not only for Windows but for other software Flash Silverlight and hackers are not going to be mercifull with those users that still use XP. So Microsoft offers a solution You pay for extended patch support and that payment includes the extra development time microsoft have to put dedicated developers or rerouting development time and Microsoft will not offer that for too long if it means taking long to develop new products.And  for hardware makers Microsoft is stoping them for the same reason in the development cicle to no make the OS grow bigger and bigger or to let the OS fully support the power of the hardware. Or you rather run Windows  on a new alienware paying microsoft to develop drivers for a  years old OS to work? Even if in this you are refering to the Intelwindows  case microsoft is not stoping hardware makers for the support is the OS that warns you about the support and also in the case of windows  in kabbylake you can download an optional patch to still use windows  in your new intel processor.,windows,dfkzhw6,2,t5_2qh3k

The path will tell you what application it is a part of. If you can reinstall or restore that application restore a previous version of that file or do a virus scan on that file. You could also kill it with task manager and temporarily rename the file if you need to keep it from running although thats not a permanent fix. If you want to see if it is opening connections to the internet you can do netstat aon at the command line to see if that process id pid has anything open to the internet.

You may be waiting  perhaps even  hours for Windows  to spin up your hard disk doing absolutely nothing until it finally shows you the updates you need to install. The hilarious part as you found out yourself is that if you try to find the specific patch that fixes this problem and try to install it using the Windows Update Standalone installer that installer insists on doing a search for any other updates first before it will install the standalone patch. Its the most hilarious catch  Ive ever seen! The fix is that you need to kill the Windows Update service before launching the standalone updater.

It needed to be modernized XPs driver model was still effectively the same as NTs from  and sometimes you just have to take that hit.  Microsoft screwed up by not giving a long enough lead time to hardware manufacturers I think they gave them something like a year?  Dont quote me on that though.  But hardware manufacturers screwed up because they tried to use this as a break to push customers to buy new hardware.  Obviously that didnt happen as quickly as they wanted though by  Vista was quite solid.gt Aside from that the only thing that sucked about Vista was that its compositing window manager had a memory growth bug.  The more windows you had the more memory it would consume.  That was fixed in Windows  and IIRC was backported to Vista in one of the service packs I think it was the Platform Update which backported DX and a bunch of other new Win stuff.

11676333,0,t1_dgj4xvs,Also there is a solution to this. Its called not installing the patches that have telemetry in them.,windows,dgjj1o7,4,t5_2qh3k
11676807,1,t1_dgjapfh,gt Telemetry is an important tool to get ahead of new security threats. Google used telemetry collected from SafetyNet on Android devices to detect Ghost Push a couple of years ago.The usual security scareware bullshit theyve been peddling the last couple of years.  It doesnt work anymore son.  Your broken update system took care of that.,windows,dgjkzck,7,t5_2qh3k
11698256,0,t1_dglx68n,So if its a Microsoft account it requires a complex password because its an online account but a local account should enable a password like z so I should be able to go back and create it as local instead to work around the issue? As for a child account Im not going down that road. I remember some accounts I created as child accounts ended up being a huge pain in the ass for my older son. ,windows,dgm0kx0,3,t5_2qh3k

11741286,0,t1_dgqrzp5,Unfortunately you should wait then.  Even if there was a technical way you are essentially breaking policy with equipment you dont own yet.Just wait it out and deal with wired headphones until you own the laptop yourself and can do what you want with it.Essentially think of it is as Loan to own program.  While it is under loan it isnt your property.  Once youve successfully completed your high school you own it.Until that day you can buy a dongle that will transmit standard audio out to bluetooth.  That shouldnt break the policy.This one is USB powered but there is nothing to install.  It only uses the USB port for power and not actual software.,windows,dgqwksy,4,t5_2qh3k
