3995684,0,t3_368pkr,This song can be found on the album I Cant Handle Change    Hanging out where I dont belong is nothing knew to me.  I get tired and I get sick and then I lose the strength to leave.  I cant handle change.  I cant handle change.  Nothing I do is ever good.  Nothing I do is ever good enough.  Nothing I do is ever good.  Nothing I do is ever good.  Nothing I do is ever good enough.  Nothing I do is ever good.    Leave me alone.  Leave me alone.  I wanna go home now.  Leave me alone.  Leave me alone.  I wanna go home now.    I cant help but repeat myself  I know its not your fault.  Still lately I begin to shake for no reason at all.  For no reason at all.  For no reason at all.  For no reason at all.  For no reason at all.,WILTWIFLS,crbqp08,1,t5_2zseg
