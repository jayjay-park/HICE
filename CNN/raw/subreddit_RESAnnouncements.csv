1393842,0,t1_ciqik7n,In the mean time you could send feedback to the subreddit mods. I dont use night mode myself so I didnt realize that there was one mismatcing element in our subreddit style that made night mode look really weird.,RESAnnouncements,ciqzzad,1,t5_2sy6n

6668478,0,t1_d08v3uo,gtPersonally Id love to see the thread titles in the bluepurple rather than the greys if thats part of it then Im in! OIm posting this for anyone else who was looking for the colored links in night mode. This style reversion isnt what I was looking for thanks so much though for giving us options! but I found the change that will.Posted here the second item down titled NIGHT MODE IS COLORFUL gives the bluepurple thread links Ive been trying to figure out how to get. This looks great to me with the current version of RES though others may like to revert as well and combine the two effects.Again thanks for the options!,RESAnnouncements,d092tqc,5,t5_2sy6n

8831653,0,t1_d78gvxm,Sorry for the doublecomment but I think Ive discovered the source of this bug. The problem is here boldgt .resnavTop headerbottomright gt    top pxgt    borderradius    pxgt    bottom autoThis text was copypasted from the inspect element feature in Firefox hopefully its helpful. Youve assigned the headerbottomright element a top value of px overriding whatever top value it has from the subs css and causing it to move to a specific position on the screen i.e.  pixels below the top of the header. This causes elements such as randomized pictures keyed to it to move with it. I can see why you did this  moving the userbar down removes it from the bar at the very top of the page allowing more room for shortcuts etc. On a normal reddit page this is a clear improvement. This just doesnt play well with pages that rely on the logout button being in the same place for all users. ,RESAnnouncements,d79fw2q,1,t5_2sy6n

9868737,0,t1_datsckf,Heres a related guide from MSDNUsed for standalone app development instead of web dev but it might be interesting to read given your question about how to alert the user of changes in the functioning of a given piece of code. You could make the icon yellow instead of an orange or red. That might be less alarming to users while also drawing their eye to the corner of the screen where your software tray is.,RESAnnouncements,datx3od,20,t5_2sy6n
