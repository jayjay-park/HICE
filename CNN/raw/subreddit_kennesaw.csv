9381228,0,t3_5928dq,This is interesting to me because I walked outside around am and noticed smoke around as well nothing too thick visibly though. I live off Wade Green and the smell was very strong but then again it could have been my fireplace neighbors cleaning out the chimney chutes. I live around a lot of older people and theyre always up at dawn so it could be the case.EDIT Well another thing could be the Little River Canyon fire that happened in Alabama Sunday Morning. If you look into it youll see that the winds pushed smoke trail towards our direction from satellite pictures. That actually matches up better with my description of the smell goes along with you speculating a wildfire as well.,kennesaw,d954ye5,2,t5_2s4pu
