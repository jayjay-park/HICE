9847628,0,t1_daq98ku,Ive been trying to do that and not having much luck. First I had to reinstall cygwin to include wget using this tutuorialThen I had to figure out the right arguments to pass. This was helpful But that resulted in it downloading lots and lost of files but no actual mps and for the life of me I cant figure out where it downloaded them to. The saved to path is another webaddress. I accidentally interrupted it and now it stopped downloading. Now Im crawling through wget help to try and figure it out myself. I ended up constructing the following commandwget np accept.mp r x o cnerdcore But that doesnt seem to do anything. No error no execution nothing. Any advice?,nerdcore,dar62xk,1,t5_2qmue
