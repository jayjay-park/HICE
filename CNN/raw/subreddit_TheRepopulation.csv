2687781,0,t3_2qtg0a,The age of games currently is instant gratification. I dont mean WoW type of Persistentyet quick gratification of epics. I mean games like CSGO DOTALoLSmite insert high skill ceiling arena here All games I love btw and that have been made well. But it just doesnt scratch that persistent world itch that MMORPGS do. People love being able to log onto something for an hour win or lose and be done with it.The business modal of MMORPGs has been stagnant for a very long time  a month for a sub patches on a semi regular basis And im sure gaming companies are now looking at how successful Valve have become with DOTA  items for heroes CSGO weapon skins TF hats. Riot does it with Champ skins for LoL. All through a cash shop. Even Blizzard are doing it for Heroes of the storm with different skins for those heroes at a pretty penny might i add Jesus some are expensive. The issue however with having a cash shop now in MMORPGS is that they have a horrible stigma surrounding them with people instantly assuming it is pw. If youve released your game with a optional sub but its fp really youve got to keep ramping things in the cash shop to keep gaining revenue even if everyone did buy that cosmetic wedding dress youre only going to buy so many and then what? They need to earn money so its almost a nail in its own coffin forcing it to add those kinda pw but not really pw items.Where does it end?Im kinda rambling and lost my point but to wrap things up simply. I believe MMORPGS are just something the new generation of gamer doesnt want. The generation who loved them now has familyjobsless free time so can not put in the hours to truly play and the people who can do both dont want to put up with a suboptimal freemium mess that hasnt even established its self but its asking you for  out the gate for this weeks new gashapon chest. Its funny because people actually pay it the first time.Therefore I believe until a new genre or something proven comes a long nothing else will be good. Youll forever be flittering between a couple weeks of path of exile here some CSGOLoL games in an evening if you get a group or do one solo mm and rage quit because you got a team of Russians.Its time to find some other things to supplement gaming whilst were in this draught.Were in the age of the Cocaine Gamer we want quick highs of a win and well put up with the come down of being bored in a week.,TheRepopulation,cn9evb4,4,t5_2ue7d
2750630,0,t3_2re8ib,Its a nobrainer to have a fourpack the game is a sandbox communityfocused game.While the developer comments there that theres no reason not to buy four copies and gift them to friends one of the original commenters already listed the reason the prohibitive price. The point of a pack is a more accessible price. Four copies at present is  which is pretty steep for gifting to friends who might not even be into the game  especially for a game thats ultimately going to be freeplay.,TheRepopulation,cngqh3z,1,t5_2ue7d
2819902,0,t3_2sdm9y,I myself have not watched a whole load of available videos so I fully admit there may already be some out there that does this but I am very interested in this game especially the ability to progress without having to do combat. So maybe you could show a variety of different ways to accomplish this cos lets be honest i think everyone on Earth knows how to level up by killing Mobs!?,TheRepopulation,cnom6jh,2,t5_2ue7d

3362641,0,t1_cpbbmpt,You are correct I was called out on it and replied in a way that would prove that I believed I was doing nothing wrong. I still believe that I did nothing wrong for what its worth. I find it very hard to believe that looping a hotkey while I am attending it is any different from physically pressing a hotkey while I am attending it. Apparently though what I did was a serious offense  to be classified with exploiting or hacking. Its hard to type that without rolling my eyes.I think my post displays an inappropriate manner in which the staff acted towards me. I was put in Jail before I could even respond to the Hello message from a GM. I was then moved out of jail in a completely different area than I was to start. It was a public spectacle that I did not deserve. A simple tell would have sufficed but thats not what happened.Im not demanding a refund because I was punished for breaking the rules. Im not banned and that is not the reason I am asking for one. I was mistreated by the staff.I dont really care about the money its more of the principle behind it. If I actually cheated or knowingly exploited the game or broke the TOS this post would not exist. If a GM had simply messaged me saying Hey you arent allowed to loop a keystroke virtually that would have been the end of it. Thats not what happened.,TheRepopulation,cpbke4p,1,t5_2ue7d
