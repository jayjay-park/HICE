2175116,0,t1_clga77p,From esteli you really will only have a couple options.   Go way out of your way and cross on the carribean side at waspam. Its a military checkpoint and will be multiple days of travel to tegucigalpa. Not recommended for your route unless you are looking more for the adventure than just getting to your destination.  It almost quite literally takes you through the middle of nowhere.You can take a bus to ocotal and up to teotecacinte a well overlooked tiny crossing north of jalapa.very laid back and not crowded. It will take multiple buses to get to and im not sure the bus situation on the honduras side.You can go to leon and then north to somotillo which is probably the most used crossing. Its a little out of the way but if you are nervous of being the only foreigner at the crossing or being in the middle of nowhere its a good crossing.Most likely youll use the crossing just north of somoto. Its a straight shot north from esteli and is the closest you can get there easily and its good roads. Its a major crossing so you wont be isolated.and its a quick shot through danli and into tegucigalpa from that crossing. On good newish roads.,Honduras,clgb5zf,3,t5_2r9ey

5106190,0,t3_3kt5hx,that sounds like a solid plan. I personally dont have experience but my friend bought a new bike a couple of years ago. He needed his ID RTN and motorcycle license.I doubt you would have any problems with paperwork or anything. Since its a recreational vehicle I gtguesslt you wont need a license to buy it.Just get to a store bring proper identification your passport and you shoudnt have a problem. If youre planning to purchase it on credit then you would need proof of income to process the loan ,Honduras,cv1hj47,1,t5_2r9ey

Also do you have a recommendation on how much I should send and how long it would take to get to themback to me?,Honduras,d9oa1ay,2,t5_2r9ey

And even in Copan you can get some balleadas or other street food to fill you up for less than  as Im sure you can in Teguce but Ive never been there. Minimum wage is a nice idea that many do without. Inequality is massive but there seem to be some quite good routes out of poverty such as working on a cruise ship until you can afford to build a house. Property rights are not very secure and if the criminals ask for your house or car its quite a good idea to give it to them. That said many honest folk get by without getting robbed too regularly. People get killed quite a lot. Police in small towns dont have much choice but to comply with criminals. Supposedly military police are better.There are armed guards outside McDonalds an many other restaurants and banks etc. Security at bus stations is mostly for show as no one can really be arsed to search bags.Education is shit but getting better it used to be possible to pay your way into public school jobs I know an English teacher who doesnt speak English. Teaching in public schools pays well around m increasing to  if you stick at it. Other jobs that pay well seem to be engineer type jobs and the prevailing dream seems to be to become a civil engineer. Books that arent written in Honduras are subject to tariffs import taxes making them very expensive and they are widely considered a waste of money so its not common to meet people who read in their free time. Some people make money by buying things on US Amazon and shipping them over through shipping companies who have payed the right people to have their packages searched less thoroughly. CIA world fact book will have you believe that it is a mostly catholic country but from what Ive seen experience it is majority evangelical. Beautiful country plenty to see plenty to do! Wouldnt risk driving unless you are confident as its a little crazy! That said busses can get very cramped and you can even end up standing for hours. The above is based on my own experiences over the last four months and from talking to people. It is perhaps written in an unduly authoritative tone. ,Honduras,daln9zz,3,t5_2r9ey
