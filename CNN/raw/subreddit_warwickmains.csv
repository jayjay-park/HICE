10280221,0,t1_dc97xzs,Passive does bonus magic damage onhitQ does flat magic damage   max HP magic damage. flat damage scales off AD but still deals magic also applies onhitW and E deal no damageR deals magic damage that scales with AD and applies onhit  timesSo build wise he will lose his hybrid since he only scales off AD and onhit now but damage output wise he will still do a good mix of magic and attack damage,warwickmains,dc9bias,1,t5_39ba7
10308687,0,t1_dcbzlu0,Good point here. Didnt realize it was only OoC speed until rechecking it. DoTs and standard disengage can still stop you from finishing off a target.,warwickmains,dccjn60,1,t5_39ba7

Hes still new ofcourse but this guy might start to mean something to me. Also Yasuo is getting meh. Community hate affected me i guess.,warwickmains,dcwqnyj,1,t5_39ba7
10508050,0,t3_5qfr0v,I personally like to go bluered cynderhulk. Then either go into spirit visagedeadmans plate depending on who is getting fed on the enemy team or their comp in general. Then build the other item for balanced resists. if they dont go full adap. Trinity force frozen fist are a great addition as the extra cdr helps a lot.In general i dont get tiamat as the burn from cinderhulk is enough help for multi monster camps. Only later in the game if i want a titan hydra for more dmg.For masteries I go fervor for battle as when u build tanky as I do u want a bit more damage. Full tank ww seems the best imo.,warwickmains,dcz75ve,1,t5_39ba7

10875882,0,t1_de1j1wr,Jax scales better because he becomes an unbeatable split pusherduelist with a full build. Warwick just isnt as scary in the lategame. The difference is that literally everything in jaxs kit builds to him being an incredible duelist whereas warwicks kit has more utilityvariety in it. If you want to pinpoint a specific factor its because jaxs passive increased AS with every hit and ult passive bonus damage every rd attack make him scale extremely hard with attack speed so when he has a full build to give him a ton of bonus AS or the survivability to give him time to build up his passive hes an absolute monster. Warwick just doesnt have as extreme scalingsreward for building certain stats.,warwickmains,de1rq1e,1,t5_39ba7

11666173,0,t1_dgi9tbu,From what it sounds like hes saying is when he qs go in with q so he doesnt heal off the outter edge of ths axe and only slows you you can q e and fear him away for a better trade at the cost of mana. Watch out for the hook as well.,warwickmains,dgidjie,1,t5_39ba7
