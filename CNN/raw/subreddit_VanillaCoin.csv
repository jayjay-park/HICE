4372684,0,t1_csibngt,There are two sides to every story its interesting that you trust john so blindly. The message between you and myself was not the first contact I had about this subreddit  is john sharing those PMs? Did he share the PM exchanges weve had on IRC earlier this week? If not you should wonder why. If he did and youre just conveniently brushing that off youre just another dishonest person who wants to profit off the backs of naive investors who dont realize the obscene level of social controlmanipulation you guys have got going on. You know what I said was tongueincheek because I made it very clear that I am not handing over this subreddit for any reason period. And if john would share our PMs youd see that again and again.So its ok for your inner development circle to make actual threats against me but I cant even make speculations or conjecture based on evidence? Interesting. John is trying to doxattackintimidate someone for making a subreddit furthermore so far hes doxing the wrong person and hes already been turning on people in IRC who he thinks are involved or close to me but Ive never spoken to them in my life. What a wonderful person he is.Think about that again. A grown man is trying to bully someone for making a subreddit. Yes of course Im trolling the shit out of him he makes it fairly easy and hes attacking people for doing nothing wrong. He does not own the right to talk about VNL he doesnt have the right to attack people who dont want to do things exactly his way and he certainly doesnt have the right to make ridiculous threats of very real harm.gtI doubt you even know the people you just insulted and what is their stance on censorshipSo I should trust you an administrator of johns primary forums which he censored heavily during the launch and then passed off to you  you want me to believe he has no influence over you? You seem to believe every word he says. Would any of my posts here have stayed around on vanillacointalk? I dont think so.,VanillaCoin,csijc6r,1,t5_35tq8
