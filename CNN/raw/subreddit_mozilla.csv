2790940,0,t1_cnl1v3l,gt Yep that Ive realised.Oh. Well cool then.gt Im sorry I offended youNo offense from you I find stupidity offensive but to personalize a random person behind text nah.gt  but you will have to admit youre not the most polite redditor Ive met.True I dont care for being polite on the internet its like an automatic door thanking you for using it. Here we have a chance to just be ideas to discuss  yet people go out of their way to personify it use their nicknames and build points so they can win arguments by things like Ive been on here longer therefore I am right rather than just discuss things and prepare to be wrong the best thing in the world is being wrong!gt Yes and No.lol dont blame you.gt thats nothing a website couldnt do before with javascriptWhich is fine thats like the point of javascript then you could see the request and the code and go aha cool. Hyperlink auditing is a secret request. Which again is fine  theres no reason they couldnt let people know about it the way in which is was brought in brand new fake as if theres a real standard corp just for this and worse the way in which Mozilla handled it.gt Im saying Im always open to learn see?Thats cool go one step further hope to be wrong!One day youll realize the only way you move forward is being wrong or at least not knowing the point of realizing you dont know something is also the point where you know it because you cant realize you didnt know bananas were radioactive until you learn they are.Hope to be wrong! Its much less boring than realizing everyone else is wrong all the time and much less work.gt But in my opinion its still better than the other alternatives Google Opera Microsoft Apple.Objectively no shitty code base that was one of the arguments Ive had with mozdevs over the years and now an barely legal ho hum! nonprofit thats acting very much like someone chasing commercial decisions over customer decisions. The yahoo! move basically makes them out to be a company using your clicks and data as a bargaining chip.Iceweasel is just the same codebase but without the branding  money going to the lazy assholes are Mozilla.Then comes the other side the political  youre voting with your value  if you use Firefox youre giving money to the lazy. Mozilla has changed a lot since the Andreessen days. He was a froody guy but now its the lackys the layabouts the people who strove to get their cushy place who are left.The selfrespecting people left Mozilla years ago. They tried to bring on more idiotintellects to do their bidding but in reality youre propping up some busyidiots vanity.To me thats sickening in a way maybe I am filling in too much of the details but its something Ive seen a lot of the last ten years of MozillaNo worries thanks for showing at least a shred of intellectual honesty on here!,mozilla,cnlbitb,1,t5_2qh4q
5599819,0,t1_cwr6kl5,I see. The reason I ask is that Im curious whether or not switching to Nightly or the development build is worth it for the multiprocess functionality. My worry is that the relative instability would end up causing other potentially worsemore annoying problems.Im not a developer in any capacity so the development tools would probably be of no use to me.,mozilla,cwr7loy,1,t5_2qh4q
