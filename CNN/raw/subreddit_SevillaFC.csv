8567550,0,t1_d6cf4kt,Yeah the way we dominated and took control of possession I thought was amazing. We had about  possession which is incredible when in our last two matches against Real Madrid at home we had  and away only  possession. This was a good step up and shows that we can take control of matches away from big teams we just need to work on our finishing and defence. But this will make for an interesting match up against Barca in our next two games the posession stat will be interesting to see!!!But yeah I agree with what you say on Navas. Navas was and is still a legend so it would be surprising if most or even some of the fans turned their back on him. But yeah Ramos didnt play too long with the first team so if you look at it just form playing time it seems bad. But I have been following Ramos for quite some time and I definitely know that he is still a Sevilla fan which is one of the reasons why I like him not necessarily because of what he has done as he has been with Madrid for a very long time now but because he is just another player and fan who is thankful for Sevilla if that makes sense. He has said on plenty of occasions that Sevilla and Real Madrid are the only two teams for him. So I suppose I can see why people will hate him if they only see him as completely forgetting where he came from. Which is what makes it more disappointing that he scores against us...Also funnily enough when Navas and the other players left such as Negredo Medel and Kondogbia is the year we went on to win the Europa League...,SevillaFC,d6civak,2,t5_2v61b

9545930,0,t1_d9orp6n,Its a real shame and quite annoying. Not even Manchester City played that well against Barcelona but still managed to win.Its even more annoying when you look at their first goal because it should have been offside. Messi shoots while Rakitic was offside and although he didnt touch it he moved out from the path of the ball which then went in. So with the new offside rules should have discounted it. I think that would have completely changed the whole match its such a shame.We are already  points behind top so challenging for the title looks a lot less likely than last week. Lets hope we keep up and can put in some good performances and go far in Europe and the Copa Del Rey.,SevillaFC,d9pqeft,2,t5_2v61b
