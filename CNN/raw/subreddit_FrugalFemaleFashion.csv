951686,0,t1_chcggg2,Depends on what you like I think either would look really pretty. I just think wedges do well on grass and look much better than flats for a special occasion especially. I prefer closed toe wedges because from my experience they tend to be more comfortable and I dont have to worry about my toes squishing through or painting themneeding a pedicure and such. Im not a big high heel person at all but I love how they look and wedges are a great balance between the two and youll be able to walk on grass without problems. I would also go with a nude not only because itll match your gorgeous dress but also because itll make your legs look longer and youd be able to wear them with almost anything else. Im sorry I dont have any links for you Im on my phone but I think if you just try to find a decent pair that your comfortable in you dont have to spend a ton of money and I think theyd look great. For a nude color I think itd be better to go on the lighter side rather than darker because your dress is light. Also congrats on graduating!!! I am too this June its a really great feeling!!,FrugalFemaleFashion,chcgqp0,1,t5_2tnuv

If you dont think its too casual and its what you want dont let the maid of honor try to push you into buying everyone more expensive dresses. Youre not being a bridezilla youre being reasonable. If your maid of honor is that upset tell her she can buy everyone the more expensive more formal dresses especially since you are breaking with tradition and buying everyone their dresses.,FrugalFemaleFashion,d9f9yiv,7,t5_2tnuv

Or you could buy her some cute PJs massage oil and a candle and give her a great massage experience at home! That would be super thoughtful and cheap. I also got a great robe for Valentines Day one year I thought that was a great gift. Comfy I use it all the time and its not overly lavish for an otherwise minor holiday.,FrugalFemaleFashion,ddjb5b8,1,t5_2tnuv

11484110,0,t3_63x6bd,The Limited used to be my source for this. It wasnt super quality but it had that heft that separates shit costume stuff from decent. On sale you could do well  but now thats done.JCrew and Banana outlets might be a good option for comparable stuff if youre trying for nicer than that level youre outside my price range. On a totally disposable level I have probably gotten more compliments on Forever pieces than any others  if you look regularly you can find some really creative singular stuff that makes an impression. It costs nothing but it doesnt last either I find my most beloved pieces from them have the finish wear off before they break. ,FrugalFemaleFashion,dfxq04w,7,t5_2tnuv
