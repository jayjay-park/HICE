3283809,0,t3_2xqwdh,I love Vs theyre the starting point for most great cars but this review is missing something important. While Mustangs have had a wild V musclecar side to them they also lived comfortably as  cylinder cruiser cars. A great looking car at an affordable price isnt that what originally launched the Mustang to succes in ? If I were spending that kind of cash Id personally spend a bit more for the bent eight but its all about having that choice.,CarsAustralia,cp2kxa7,3,t5_2zbyb

7075037,0,t1_d1e1x7i,I can attest to this yeah. A mate of mine bought a CJ sedan that had been in a minor collision but was otherwise pretty clean in the early s as a donor car. Wouldve been a totally fixable restorable car in its own right but at the time these were just old cars not worth very much money so who cared if its a fairly rare car. My mate stripped out the engine tranny and all the other good bits and put them in a VF coupe. Scrapped the rest.I knew of a few other people with s in VFVGVH Valiants which obviously never had them as standard in the s and s some of which im sure wouldve been stripped out of CxCs.Other thing is a lot of the CxCs not that there were many to start with they were never popular when new particularly the coupes wouldve been modified heavily in the s and early s when they werent worth much because they had that great drivetrain in there already. I had a charger in the late s early s and used to go to mopar meets and I remember seeing a few CH coupes at those some which had been given the muscle car treatment and had stripes and bonnet scoops and big exhausts and things. Which is the opposite of what the factory wanted the cars to be haha,CarsAustralia,d1ibhu5,1,t5_2zbyb

10092941,0,t1_dbkvko3,Do you know which XR model is the best? From what I can see its the LV but Im unsure what the specific differences are. ,CarsAustralia,dbn4jvs,1,t5_2zbyb
10166821,0,t3_5lfkx5,Commodores are also boring and going from a lancer to a big car youll find cornering will be even more boring ,CarsAustralia,dbwgr7a,1,t5_2zbyb
11049492,0,t3_5wfs0x,A day late but Ill comment anyway. Has anyone put much money into mods that improve handling for either SS or XR Turbos? Can they actually be made to handle very well?,CarsAustralia,dekfvpy,2,t5_2zbyb
11530854,0,t1_dg2mkyx,I read up on all the road rules and apparently on a  lane roundabout if someone is in the inner lane the and they want to change they have to give way to the outer lane if that car is anywhere on the roundabout. So hopefully when I get the claim I can explain the situation.  Thanks for the reply! ,CarsAustralia,dg30w05,2,t5_2zbyb
