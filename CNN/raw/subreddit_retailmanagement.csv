5231747,0,t3_3mj3pt,Speaking from a grocery store standpoint usually its a non issue as we have specific receiving days with a receiving clerk at the door. In his downtime he files paperwork from his invoices. There is very little downtime as there are  drivers a day that come from different companys to deliver product.If a truck shows up after receiving hours or on a non receiving day they are usually left to the mercy of the grocery manager. The driver SHOULD know the revoevinf hours before they deliver though.SMS is an awesome idea though!,retailmanagement,cvgm7gy,1,t5_2x8e0
