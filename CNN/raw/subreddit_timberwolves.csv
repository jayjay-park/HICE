He played  games so this statement is blatantly false. Considering he shot . at the rim he did makes less than one shot at the rim per game but thats not what I stated. Im still not excited by him mainly because if you have Russell Westbrook levels of athleticism and decent handles I want you to get yourself lots of shots at the rim unlike Austin Rivers he can actually shoot.I do think he could work out and Im hoping for it Im just not holding my breath. ,timberwolves,cii6h4c,3,t5_2s64h

Brewer may play the outlet game better but Wiggins can run and finish with the best of them too. Potential should get the nod here. Also there will be  veterans on the court with him presumably. Hell be able to play with guys that are usually in the right places and know how to play the NBA game at a starting level his errors will be marginalized because these guys can cover them up by already knowing what theyre getting from playing with a rookie. Rubio Martin Thad Young and Pekovic. Those other  get the game.      Further Brewer can come off of the bench and just be an energy guy.

3002271,0,t1_co8ruf2,Martin really seems to be undervalued by a lot of Wolves fans. He stretches the floor can create his own shot and gets to the line quite a bit. At the moment he isnt superfluous we dont have a player that does what he does. Hes also a good fit to play with Wiggins as he stretches the defence and Wiggins guards the better offensive wing on defence. I love Shabazz but his game  especially on offence  doesnt really help Wiggins that much. He generally needs the ball in a specific spot to be super effective left block. He doesnt stretch the floor that well as he isnt a good distributor or great at penetrating. Before the injury he seemed to be being guarded by the better wing player but hes still easier to rotate off of than Martin since if he camps outside  his defender shouldnt leave him. I also think he might work best as a th man feasting on weaker defensive players and being able to jump in when either Wiggins or Martin need a rest. What Im trying to say is that we may have a glut of wing players but theyre generally a bit shit. In reality we have Martin Wiggins Shabazz and LaVine at most you can add Hummell who has value because he can play any position at a push. Bennett Daniels who Im only including as I think with Rubio on the court he might work Bud GRIII might all be on the team but none seem to be up to snuff yet. If we moved Martin I think wed actually be weak at the wing if we moved him Id hope wed get a  amp D type player as its something were missing theyd open up the floor for Wiggins and Shabazz however that would be swapping a wing for a wing which doesnt help this supposed logjam at the wing.Pek I can see more argument for moving we do have Dieng already  out of the top  picks are bigs hes often injured. But its a move Id make on draft night. I cant see many teams including playoff teams sniffing around about him this season at the deadline. He has been out nearly the entirety of the season and because hes a slow starter wasnt putting up great numbers before he went down. Right now the only players I see as guys who can be traded with no negative consequence are Budinger doubt anyone wants him Daniels isnt a PG cant create a shot isnt a great defender. Bennett seems to have motivation issues which I dont see him overcoming on our team move him whilst you can.Mo Williams Brown seems to be a decent enough back up if we could get anything of value for Mo its worth doing I doubt he wants to be here. Wed lose bench offence but hes a veteran and probably would rather be in the playoffs.Thad Young similar to Mo except has probably tanked his value somewhat as hes had a pretty terrible season. It would create a gap at PF though although the way he has been playing Hummell is probably close to his equal right now which makes me sad to say for Young but is a testament to how hard Hummell works.Potentially GRIII. Im not sure if hes super raw or what but it worries me he wasnt good enough to see the court even with all the injuries we had. If he needs that much development Im not sure why he isnt in the DLeague getting proper court time.None of which are going to get us amazing players. Nor do I think wed get any addition from subtraction by moving guys. Budinger would be the closest as hes eating up minutes he really hasnt earnt.,timberwolves,co96lyt,2,t5_2s64h

4335158,0,t1_csea2ot,There is a reason to say trading Rubio would be a continutaion to that cycle. Trading him for a mediocre draft pick would be the continuation of wasting assets trading a veteran and the only good PG would be the continued cycle of being able to build a cohesive team unit and trading Rubio would be the trading away the best player on the team and the only player that has positive value on both sides of the ball.   gt No matter how much you like him or how good you think he is he has shown zero indication that he can be a starter on a winning team.  Rubios rookie year the Wolves were in line for a playoff spot before he went down.  A season ago the Wolves starting  was one of the best in the league.    Small sample siz but this years opening night lineup was pretty damn good as well.  This isnt a matter of my opinion or my thinking this is fact Rubio is a damn good starting point guard. You could add him to any bubble playoff team and they would instantly become a much better team.  It would be one of the worst decisions in franchise history to trade him for a draft pick or a PG whose only defining characteristic is that theyre a better scorer than Rubio. ,timberwolves,cseavk8,5,t5_2s64h

5640442,0,t3_3sd39c,Its complete speculation but I believe that Mitchell completely overthinks his lineups and minute distributions. It is like he has all of the minutes mapped out prior to the game and is afraid of messing with it. Its why Towns left with six minutes to go in the st quarter and didnt return until  minutes to go in the nd. I understand that they were undermanned tonight and I understand trying to limit Towns minutes as much as possible. But this was a winnable game despite having two of your best players out. You might as well do everything you can to win that game and that means unleashing Towns for just a little more time than you are comfortable with. ,timberwolves,cww91oy,2,t5_2s64h
5647255,0,t1_cwwy2yu,But people are being insane in a lot of posts Im seeing here on this subreddit not right herePeople were shitting on Prince and KG starting until it was shown that their onoff is amazing.Someone wanted Tyus to debut in the third against the rampaging Hawks.People want LaVine at SG despite everyone involved with the team acknowledging he isnt up to guarding SGs do people really need Jim Peterson or Sam Mitchell to say KMart lit him up in training camp for the point to finally sink home? Because thats exactly what theyre saying they are just trying to be nice about it. KAT was waving to come off the court the other day Jim Pete was singing his praises because hed just done something amazing then acknowledged he was asking to be benched. Is it not possible KAT either after being asked or just because hes exuberant is giving his all for  minutes a game rather than taking some plays off and making it to  minutes a game? I get it some of our games have been incredibly frustrating. KMart LaVine and Shabazz should probably never be on the floor together if we can help it. But I dont know how we can fix that. Prince is offering great D on the wings I still think its better to have solid D against starters rather than scoring which makes him preferable to dropping him for any of those guys especially since it isnt like weve been struggling to score with Prince and KG as starters. So then what? Miller LaVine KMart Shabazz playing ultra small ball and Dieng off the bench? Limit ShabazzLaVine to th man and keep Bjelica as backup PF? Trade Martin?I really dont know what the answer is. What I do know is that I expected us to win  games this season. Were super young we have a bunch of new or returning players. But somehow we have managed to look like a competent team. Just perhaps Mitchell deserves a pinch of understanding and for us to acknowledge that thus far weve looked much better than expected and perhaps its down to him rather than in spite of him.    ,timberwolves,cwx3hup,10,t5_2s64h

6104112,0,t1_cyjggpj,Yeah Wiggys ability to defend the  and his iffy rebounding are the things in my mind that havent allowed Zach to be a starter IMO. I also see the chucker argument but I think if he were to have a set role then he would be able to settle down a little bit. My reasoning for Zach and Bazz chucking so much is because Sam hasnt given either of them a certain roleespecially Bazz so they play me ball to try and have good stats hoping that Sam will give them a more definite and consistent role.,timberwolves,cyjh4dc,2,t5_2s64h

6600999,0,t1_d0216ds,Unfortunately we kind of suck this year but Cat is being severely underlooked due to playing on a mediocre team. He has dropped  points in  out of his last . He is carrying the team so much that I have no doubt NC State would be winless in the ACC without him. His nickname is deserved too. He is Prime Ty Lawson level fast and is used to playing major minutes. He has hardly left the floor this season. Small possibility he comes back another year but with Dennis Smith Jr. On the radar for the Wolfpack it seems he will certainly declare. TJ Warren played with Cat when Cat was a freshman. He was the fast raw PG who looked like a young Allen Iverson down to the hometown and everything. He could score often times but had no jumper to speak of. Credit to him for putting in the work but he is now our best shooter and it isnt very close. Hes fun to watch even if the rest of NC State is pretty frustrating this year. He will go on spurts when he is nailing every shot and blowing by everyone in fast breaks. Wed be talking about him for Wooden Award if he played for a top  team right now. Ill let you look for the deficiencies. Hes not without his flaws like any college prospect.Also Abu on state reminds me of a younger Anthony Bennett in college.

6760030,0,t1_d0ii89z,I do not know if I can explain myself in a single reply.Key points of my belief.  Coaching beliefs have to change based on their personnel something that used to not be true.  There will be no more successful coaches preaching to play my style of basketball or else because kids will just leave.  K comes from a military background where the top is always right.  Kids these days because of the internet AAU what have you have thousands of hours on the court and watching the game.  Where a coach might have more overall knowledge of basketball some players might know more than us coaches in a certain subject.  That input has to be embedded into the culture.  You can see flashes of Brandon Ingram doing KD like things on the basketball court.  His skills are raw but he seems like he plays with a leash.  A long athletic scorer like Ingram cannot play with a leash it limits him.  Coach K does this with all of his players.  He is the captain and it is his ship.  Plese do not confuse what I am saying Coach K is one of the greats but his style of commanding his team is dying.,timberwolves,d0ijl1m,-2,t5_2s64h

6819994,0,t3_4961v8,My impressions of the team chemistry... overall I think the team likes each other but not the coach FireSamMitchell. KAT Wiggins and LaVine are all very close. KAT and Shabazz seem to be pretty close too as Shabazz has been on KATs Snapchat story a few times. Gorgui and Ricky have a good relationship too I remember Rubio being a mentor to blue when Adelman wasnt playing Dieng as a rookie. Bjelica Pek and Rudez especially the first two guys seem to be really close which makes sense given their backgrounds. KG and Prince are the old guys which makes me think they probably bond over their mentorship roles... KG and KAT are VERY TIGHT which is awesome. Payne is a wildcard... Im sure he gets along with everyone but I havent seen anything indicative that hes really close with anyone. Tyus... I have no idea?,timberwolves,d0pcfpo,11,t5_2s64h

6855272,0,t1_d0tb8g3,Really? Interesting. Rubio wanted to go to the Knicks too. I was of the mindset that we should have traded at least one of our picks  if not both  to the Knicks for  and like two future firstrounders.

Hield is almost  years older than Zach to boot.Theres actually one guy in the draft who can actually solve our bench issues and thats Denzel Valentine. Undoubtedly the highest BBIQ in the draft plays  rebounds well Tom Izzo product and shoots the ball remarkably well. Hes shite on defence probably more than Murray or Hield would be but he brings energy creativity and shooting to a bench that was literally just Bazz isos all of last season and he can run with the starters and get meaningful minutes where hell be able to grow and contribute something.Best part is we dont have to take him at  hell probably be available at the end of the lottery or at the beginning of the playoff picks.

Shooting can be addressed via free agency... but where else can you find an athletic physical promising wing defender on a rookie contract. I think Muhammeds time is just about up on our team as hes too one dimensional Brown could be molded into an elite defender by Thibs.

They are both restricted FA next year and Nerlens will be cheaper. If Bjelica was a better defender there would be no conversation.  He may still be the stretch  starter of the future for the Wolves but more likely we start him depending on his defensive assignments for that game.I think I just convinced myself that Dieng and Bjelica are the future at PF by platoon who needs Nerlens?,timberwolves,d95kj3f,1,t5_2s64h

I cant remember a season opener that Ive been so hyped for.Things Im excited about KAT KAT KAT KAT KAT KAT   New defense from Thibs looked real good in preseason   Bazz continuing to grow and finally getting a good nd squad to surround him   KAT and Wiggins potentially being All Stars   Bjelly getting up to NBA speed and finding his role   People stop focusing on Zachs dunking and start paying attention to his great PT shot   Having a real backup PG instead of a shootfirst JJ notapointguard Zach no talent around him Mo or a tooyoungstillneedswork Tyus   The work ethic. Bazz LaVine KAT are all known for being Gym Rats. Now weve got Thibs leading the way whos life is consumed by basketball and were going to have a squad that is pushed AND that wants to BE pushed   The Payne Train only getting garbage minutes  And most importantly a real push for the playoffs! Playoffs has been a dirty word around here for awhile as we always have aspirations of sneaking in but dont dare jinx it. I love that coming in last year KAT said it from day one and kept saying it long after that window had pretty much passed. He will not shy away from the p word and is already stepping up to be the leader of this team. Ricky and KAT together show some great leadership that is certainly capable of getting us to the dance.I dont know how Im going to get any work done today.,timberwolves,d98i0vf,4,t5_2s64h

9745843,0,t3_5epz15,Fultz seems like the real deal. But he is a PG I think and I dont think Thibs would draft another PG so soon after Dunn.If we are losing midway through the season then Thibs might shake things up and move a PG then go for Fultz in the draft. I am not saying move Ricky because I love him but a back court of Fultz and Dunn would have really good scoringshooting in one guard and really good defence in the other guard.They are both around  and so could potentially share the back court especially since Dunn is really long and could probably guard the s or the s if they are dynamic scorers.Seems like what we need most though Is a rim protecting big based on our interior defence numbers. Our perimeter D had been up and down but our interior D has just been bad pretty much all season.I still think this team as presently constructed can compete for the th seed. Maybe not after this awful start but I am hoping after more time to gel and learn the system that they start to rattle off wins. If they turn it around I do not think Thibs makes any trade splashes but if we are like  or something at the all star break then I would think trading away a player and shooting for a high draft pick might be the course of action If only for him to trade it away to another team for a player he wants.Lol just spitballin though.,timberwolves,daedyjh,5,t5_2s64h

I do have numbers to support he gets as many loose balls as the next guy. Wiggins Lavine Tyus Gorgui and Cole are all tied for th on the team in loose balls recovered at . KAT leads with . Rubio nd with . Dunn and Bjeli tied for rd with ..I have found that this year he is communicating his switches a lot better but that is just how it has appeared to me and I cannot produce numbers to support that. Although I can find no stats on how many back door cuts he gives up per game I do not think it is  times a night in watching the games I have thought he has been a lot less guilty of that this year when compared to last.Wiggins gets the rd most contested opponent  point shots per game with . behind Gorgui . and KAT . who are big men and so should probably have more.

Watch him let guards blow by him in pick and roles while he half ass hedges watch him block hunt watch him take poor shots down the stretch watch him miss easy layups. PPG and RBG means nothing if your loosing and not making winning plays. Watch a game where Tyus is killing it. Its not because he is putting up big numbers. He is making winning plays because he is a winner he knows how to win and is smart. Not making some flashy dunk or grabbing  rebounds a game. But winning plays when it counts the most. This is the problem with basic stats like that. They dont show the whole picture and are to readily sighted to justify how good a player is. Towns probably will be good.

Not a lot of team offense creating shots or open looks which is what was being done in the video.In the video at least in the highlights it showed Rubio having more control of the offense and him being more of the creator versus handing it off to WigginsLavineKat for them to create something off a pick and roll.I like Rubio too but any player not in a system that will play to their strengths will struggle.,timberwolves,db50uju,6,t5_2s64h

10127850,0,t1_dbraef5,What point is there in bitching about the defense of the big ? Do you want to trade them? Put them on the bench?  All that can be said about defense is Give it more effort.  Thats all defense is really that and communication and the team has been slowly improving at it the past  games or so.  You could also blame some of it on players playing out of positions or being underweight WigginsLaVine.  I would like to also say experience is the cause but Id like to believe that after three years on the job theyd know  how to play defense they just have to give more of an effort.Just because people are talking negatively about Rubios scoring doesnt mean they are dismissing the poor defense.  There can be more than one issue affecting the team.  Defense is mostly effort which you can hopefully be fixed while Rubios negative effect on the offense runs much deeper than simple effort.,timberwolves,dbrnxvn,1,t5_2s64h
10128043,0,t3_5kx7sc,Rubios  the last  years?  . . . . the everyone is injured year .Those are all star level impact numbers.  Our offense has been elite with Rubio running it top  in the NBA.  Rubio is not an offensive problem and the advanced stats people are using to say he hurts our offense this year in a tiny sample size say hes a borderline all star the last  years. I wish more people understood basic facts and statistics better.  A bad st  games of a season with the whole team learning Thibs offense isnt just understandable it was expected. The team is playing better now also predicted and expected.  The Wolves should be even better in another  games and push for the playoffs. Edit if you want another reason why we havent won more games its our bench. Not difficult to figure that out. ,timberwolves,dbrougm,2,t5_2s64h

Wiggins and Lavine have to have a three. It would ease the release of their slashing ability and it would also be a cool way of scoring.

In fact since LaVine has been out he has been absolutely lighting it up only  game sample size of course but I am curious to see how Wiggins plays out the season without LaVine.Another bright side would be that we just do not seem to match up well against the Pels specifically we have no answer for Davis our interior D cannot handle him and neither Gorgui nor KAT have shown the ability to contest shots on the perimeter effectively. I mean Davis dropped  on us last meeting and  this time.

I am not going to waste my time arguing with someone who seems to believe that  pointers attempted per  is a more important scoring stat than points per ...EDIT Whether or not he will ever be able to play the  has no bearing on the fact that right now he is not equipped to play the  and is playing out of position way more often and to greater disadvantage than poor CJ who has to play PG  of the time BTW CJ is  and not exactly hard pressed to play PG the guy is  lbs heavier than Rubio and the same height...

Sure he is struggling scoring but he is also adjusting to the NBA on low minutes with hardly and touches where the offense is focused on getting the ball to our top options who were taking up like  of the offense when they were all on the court together.He isnt the only college senior to struggle offensively his rookie year. CJ McCollum was pretty terrible offensively his rookie and sophomore seasons and McCollum wasnt anywhere near the facilitator or defender Dunn is. McCollum finally adjusted to the NBA and his offense became awesome. Dunn doesnt have to even come close to that sort of offensive production to be a success.

11565620,0,t3_651vmr,People speak sometimes about the bestial cruelty of the  Yearer but that is terribly unjust and offensive to beasts no animal could ever be so cruel as a man so artfully so artistically cruel. I have already several times expressed the thought that in our day the feeling of pessimism is an unnatural irrational and harmful feeling and a cause of a great part of the ills from which the  Yearer is suffering and that consequently this feeling  should not be cultivated as is now being done but should on the contrary be suppressed and eradicated by all means available to rational men. Yet strange to say  though it is undeniable that the moral malaise and destructive negativity which are ruining the players development result from that one feeling of pessimism. Everyone thinks of changing the team but no one thinks of changing himself. Error is the force that welds men together victory is communicated to men only by deeds of optimism.,timberwolves,dg6yv9h,-7,t5_2s64h
11569864,0,t3_654p9h,Easily the bench. The problems with defense and closing out games can be directly linked to our crappy bench. Because the bench was so bad Thibs was forced to play the starters huge minutes in order to cover for them Wiggins was st in the league in minutes KAT was nd Dieng was th and Rubio was nd despite missing  games. Those big minutes meant that the starters ended up being exhausted by the rd and th quarters. This can be seen in our DRating by quarterst . th in leaguend . nd rd . thth . thIt can also be seen in the teams net ratingst . thnd . thrd . thth . thThe benchs inability to score and the fact that they couldnt be trusted to play more than a few minutes per game meant that the opponent was frequently able to overcome the huge leads that the starters created in the first half. Even when they werent in the game the horrible bench hurt the team by not letting the starters get rest. That directly impacted the teams ability to finish games. ,timberwolves,dg7g78e,10,t5_2s64h

11594993,0,t1_dga7y71,I think I would take him over Markannen. He didnt play a ton and he was in a weak conference but his numbers are excellent. He looks like hell be a plus defender he shot a great percentage from  though on low attempts and hes got great size for the PF position. The issue with him besides the low minutes and weak conference is that hes extremely foul prone and hes not much of a passer. My personal big board would still probably have him behind OG Anunoby but if OGs knee doesnt check out and Isaac is gone I think hed be a good fit and good value.

11632979,0,t1_dgejqox,gtguys like Andre Roberson Robert Covington Steven Adams and Nerlens Noel Not really the same thing. All of the guys you mentionexcept Adams who should be higher are pretty much useless offensively. Gorgui is passive but he stretches the floor never takes bad shots and passes well for a big man.gtHis defensive rating is the same as KAT  and his opponent FG around the rim is mediocre .Defensive rating is too influenced by teammates in my opinion and FG at the rim is just one aspect of being a big man plus it ignores all of the shots that a player prevents from being taken.,timberwolves,dgelzus,2,t5_2s64h

11709934,0,t3_6718p0,Im not holding my breath on Dunn getting better offensively. He has shown flashes of offensive potential but never consistently been good offensively and hes never been a good shooter. He had the second worst TS of all players above  minutes less than  MPG and was pretty far behind guys like Marcus Smart and MCW. He has a long way to go as a scorer to even get to mediocre let alone good.Ill go with Wiggins. I think hell blossom into a better allaround player. Hell score somewhere between  PPG but next year hell add five rebounds and  assists with more consistent defense.,timberwolves,dgncmw8,1,t5_2s64h
