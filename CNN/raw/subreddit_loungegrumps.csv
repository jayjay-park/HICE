51193,0,t1_cek93rx,Yeah I know there was a small handful of us that hung around on the CyTube page for a while when the subreddit was first created. Theres that awesome playlist thats there now just to watch random episodes which is cool too. I just really liked the Sonic Saturdays thing but I totally understand where youre coming from. Thanks for the update!,loungegrumps,cek9blq,3,t5_2z3vx

If you fell down you were literally stuck and you couldnt finish the game without restarting everything.So whilst doing the jumping puzzles I managed to fall off get stuck try and jump be propelled to the top of the map Not the end the top and he was laughing so hard he fell off his chair and broke his headphones.TLDR Game and headphones broken.

464306,0,t3_1zdqzc,I have a couple of online buddies that Ive known for a couple of years who watch GG. Otherwise I dont think any of my other friends watch GG. As much as Ive expressed my love and excitement for them I would think those people would have shared that joy by now. But who knows? I didnt even know one of my friends watched GG until I was posting on Facebook about what it was like to meet the Grumps at MAGfest.Beyond that my brothers watch some GG. Theyre not regular viewers but every now and then if theres an episode I happen to be watching or want to show them then they usually stick around to watch it.,loungegrumps,cft1k6c,1,t5_2z3vx

1095039,0,t3_26nfqj,Anything specific youre hyped about? Im pretty casual in the sense that Ill play a small handful of games to the point where I obsess over them and become a master and then drop them and move on. I dont really follow the whole gamer culture and couldnt care less about most big titles out there so I dont even know what the big names and expectations are this year. The only thing Im really looking forward to is SSB which will consume my life for a few weeks when I get my hands on it and a handful of DS games and perhaps a few indie titles here and there.,loungegrumps,chsrdgr,1,t5_2z3vx

1590888,0,t3_2cgssg,Remove the PS and both Gamecubes. The PS as you said is out of commision and the Wii can easily play both Wii and Gamecube games. I know there are benefits of using the Gamecubes but if size is that much of an issue youre best just removing them.Maybe try taping a cardboard back for the DVD row? Itd look tacky but it would stop the games falling out the back if thats an issue.If you havent already label your cords for each system and use twist ties to loop each one enough to just barely reach the TV. This will help with clutter and will stop wires from getting tangled.,loungegrumps,cjfpadn,2,t5_2z3vx
