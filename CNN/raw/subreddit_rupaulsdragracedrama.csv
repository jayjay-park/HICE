6577210,0,t3_45nqup,I never said that. I was  annoyed because it was making someones death political  irrelevant to RPDR and  a bunch of people cant separate that a fundamentally different reading and understanding of the Constitution isnt equivalent to actively trying to ruin peoples lives. Sorry that someone did the job they were appointed to do but had a very different interpretation. I was never a Scalia fan but that post was out of line. ,rupaulsdragracedrama,czzmyco,4,t5_3btmz

6944990,0,t1_d13c8sl,Shes implied that shes an immigrant e.g. she mentioned offhand that she must have been in South Korea when Pitch Perfect came out.Jujubee is actually not an immigrant she was born in Massachusetts shortly after her parents came from Laos. Hence the Airline story  her nonEnglish speaking mother saw the word Airline upon arriving in the United States at the airport it took her fancy and she named Jujubee Airline without knowing what it meant. The immigrant queens as far as I remember are Bebe from Cameroon to Minneapolis as an adult Ongina from the Philippines to Seattle as a child Vivacious from Jamaica to New York as a child Courtney Act from Australia to California as an adult and Kim from South Korea to Michigan I think as a child. Morgan grew up in Scotland but I believe her mother is American and so she always had dual USUK citizenship and is not technically an immigrant. Raja was born in California to an Indonesian father and Dutch mother but spent her childhood in Indonesia so shes also not technically an immigrant. There are a lot of others whose parents were probably born abroad mostly in Asia e.g. Manila Jujubee but the only Latina queen I can think of whos even firstgeneration American is Bianca whose parents came from Cuba and Honduras.,rupaulsdragracedrama,d13jmhd,4,t5_3btmz

7015543,0,t1_d1bk23u,So? That doesnt necessarily mean its wrong. Evidently you do not speak French. So its interesting how you can find my quote tacky when you dont know whats wrong with it. Im not saying my French is right Im just proving my point that youre taking offence for the sake of taking offence. ,rupaulsdragracedrama,d1bk634,1,t5_3btmz
7036278,0,t1_d1dftjk,Madonna was one of the very first people to stick up and SPEAK OUT about the AIDS stigma and about homophobia in general. She did it in a time where it wasnt seen as the norm like it is now to stand up for gay rights. There arent many other people as outspoken on these things as Madonna was and continues to be. Shes always been a major ally and supporter throughout her career. ,rupaulsdragracedrama,d1dx2tv,2,t5_3btmz
