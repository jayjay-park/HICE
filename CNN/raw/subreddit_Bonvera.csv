6276138,0,t3_41cbrx,One of the best explanations of what Bonvera is doing.gtWeve seen companies like Amazon AirBnB and Uber take existing technology not actually inventing anything but putting what already exists in the marketplace together in a more palatable combination for the consumer and redirect millions of dollars of commerce in the process. Well that is what you are a part of now an idea whose time has truly come. The Compensated Marketplace of Bonvera is here. Its a place where the consumer can take their hardearned dollars and spend them intelligently through a business model that rewards them for building market share. Because distributors and manufacturers are also looking for greater loyalty and market share the once impenetrable profit models of big manufacturing and distribution are now being shaken to reward the consumer for their loyalty and enthusiasm in sharing this gamechanging channel of commerce.,Bonvera,cz30y5w,1,t5_3bqis

Dont expect perfection from us but we will be open to dialogue. Due to the pre launch nature there are some details we cannot share until launch. Our goal is is to empower the average person just like Lynda and I to have access to an entrepreneurial opportunity that with reasonable amount of effort can produce reasonable amount of results. God bless you all.,Bonvera,czagd3l,3,t5_3bqis
