23312,0,t3_1u2vkz,We moved in together a few months after dating so I still feel qualified to answer. It was awesome at first sex everywhere cooking dinner for him fun nights watching movies.Then monthly bills roll in dishes pile up and laundry needs to get done. My advice is to nip it in the bud. Set up realistic responsibilities for each other based on skill and time. Dont be afraid to ask him to do chores but at the same time dont be afraid to do them yourself. You arent keeping a clean house for yourself youre doing it for each other.Money is a big one too and splitting bills  is not always the answer. If you make more you may be paying more in bills but your other half should be spending about the same percentage in bills that you are. Also just because youre married now that doesnt mean his money is your money or vice versa. You need to talk about big purchases that may affect those monthly bills or that affect the space you live in.I could go on and on but make a plan for as much as you can think of and when the unexpected comes up make a decision together but as if you were the other person.,wedding,ceh35h3,1,t5_2qhtr

Did they choose a wedding that would make THEM happy prioritizing what was important to THEM? Were they happy on that day? Then Id say they did get all the most important parts of the wedding right. Grow up youre not invited to a wedding to judge it on a scale from  to  based on originality elegance and tradition you are invited to share a very special moment with someone you supposedly care about. Your attitude is an embarrassment not their wedding.,wedding,cehr8kp,0,t5_2qhtr

It was what I thought was a perfect wedding.I just got engaged to the most amazing person and for some reason I just want to do the reception and thats it. No big fancy dress. No bright church. I just want my name to have his last name and be with him for as long as I can. ...and go on an amazing honeymoon. Im only . But for me right now that would be ideal.

116971,0,t1_cercd2n,Well you just said that youve gotten them and misplaced them that means you looked at them physically handled it and saw them. Now think of how many emails you get a day. How many times have you mindlessly deleted something or overlooked an important message? how many up to date emails do you have of all your family members? What about your older invitees that would get an email and be confused? I sent out email invites to a housewarming party recently and some older invites such as grandparents ignored it because they didnt think it was meant for them since it was sent electronically. Marketers still use direct mail because it has the best response rate and is reliable. Its harder to ignore something you physically touch than it is an email. It doesnt HAVE to be expensive either. You dont have to use fancy paper or anything if youre half decent in Pages or Word you can design your own postcard invites and print them out at a local staple or kinkos for a decent price.Thats just my opinion though. If you have a wedding where its mostly a young crowd it might work but even I find myself unknowingly ignoring important emails from time to time by accident  Edit also its really not hard either to get a wedding invitation and input details into an online calendar. You dont need the wedding invite the day of  its simply just about making sure everyone you want there actually sees the invite ,wedding,cerr1l3,1,t5_2qhtr

Also do you have a venue and date at least monthseason and time of day picked out for your wedding?  While that is a beautiful dress it might not be ideal for say a midday summer wedding thats outdoors.  There will always be dresses out there that you love even in a few years.  And at that point your wedding style body size and taste will be be more secure.Id only buy it if you are okay with not getting any of the money back if you change your mind or it cant be altered etc.  I know you can sell it but you really dont know for how much etc. so Id just buy if you were okay emotionally and financially if there was no return on that expense.,wedding,cf16qf9,3,t5_2qhtr

And if they really want to be lazy they can just make the client pay for everything and take the leftovers so that they dont have to store  case of a different type in their warehouse. Alcohol distributors in a lot of states will even take back unchilledunopened leftovers for a partial refund.Lazy. They had such an easy opportunity to upsell here and they chose not to.

We visited about a dozen different venues and when it was all said and done we found our venues minimum quite reasonable. Especially because its all at one location and they do it all for us. Many venues had minimums ofkk or minimum guest counts e.g. minimum of  guests at  per guest is... a LOT of money. Anyways its a good idea to talk to the venue to know whats included.

What items are the most important to you? Which items can you compromise on? You cant have your cake and eat it too. pun intendedFor the record I find it extremely selfish that she doesnt want your family there because it will make her depressed. Your family is about to become her family. I can understand why she may not want all of your extended family there but I cant believe she would actually request that your grandparents not be present! I would have compromised that immediate family and closest friends be allowed but no auntsuncles cousins friends of parents etc. Could that be a point of compromise for her? She gets the fun weddingy stuff and you get a few more guests? I seriously dont understand why having your family be present would upset her simply because her family is small.Edit Also wanted to mention that if you guys are getting married I would hope that youve found a system of compromisecommunication by now...might be something to discuss in order to grow the relationship. ,wedding,ci5b1zt,43,t5_2qhtr

1726741,0,t3_2e71oc,I think you need to ask your parents whos paying for the dinner. If they are you should give them a little more wiggle room with this. They are just happy for you and your hunny and you have to let your families feel these emotions and express themselves. I was a lot like your hunny when we started to plan our wedding I wanted it low key and low amount of guests but I realized how special it was for some family members. You have to explain to your hunny that even if he doesnt like to be the center of attention or is shy hes got to let his family and YOUR family be happy for the both of you and let them enjoy expressing it. Its tough for shy people or pennypinchers but if your parents wanna have a big dinner I think you guys will end up really enjoying it. It doesnt need to be a full blown mega ceremony and reception of course not but just let your family celebrate with you! ,wedding,cjwtjoi,14,t5_2qhtr

1816304,0,t3_2fcn05,I had the same issue with my mother. The venue we can afford a lovely old plantation is only available on thur and fri and only on weekends where there isnt a home game. Its close to the local college and tailgating is extreme so the roads are shut down on those weekends. So we picked a Friday and set the time for pm as ceremony start because I dont want to have to worry about it being too dark for pictures during the ceremony. I okayed this with my mother who is paying for most of the wedding costs almost a year ago. After the invitations are printed up she decides the time is to early and noone will be able to come because they cant get off work. She basically said the wedding would be pointless.  I about lost my shit. But my response was the invitations are printed and if they cant come oh well and if they miss the ceremony and want to come for the reception thats fine. Hopefully your future people will just let it go. Tell them they are technically going to church that day and God shouldnt care if they are in their normal church as long as they hold him in their hearts. ,wedding,ck81q1o,3,t5_2qhtr

3466451,0,t3_2zy5u2,I want to elope.  I feel that the commitment ceremony itself is a private affair between my future husband and me.  It doesnt need to be a destination wedding.  We could get the legal part out of the way at city hall have a symbolic ceremony at our favorite park in the city with just our closest friends in attendance then have a low key reception at a restaurant.  I actually dont really care if my parents and sisters arent present since so far theyve mostly thrown snide remarks and made snarky comments.  In fact as much as they deny it Im pretty sure they dont like my boyfriend simply because hes white and Im Chinese and were going to end up halfbreed kids.  When completely disregarding how my parents would react if we actually did this I dont think I would regret eloping at all.  My boyfriend is ambivalent about it.  His only condition is that his brother be present and we can totally swing that with an elopement.But I know for a fact that my parents would be deeply hurt if I didnt notify them of the wedding until after the fact and it would seriously damage my relationship with them.  As frustrating as it is dealing with their suspect racism and mood swings in regards to my boyfriend I dont want to burn that bridge.  As long as they play nice during the ceremonyreceptionwhatever we have I think boyfriend and I can tolerate it.That said my parentsspecifically my dadhas not been behaving in a way that encourages me to want to include them.  Hes been told three times prior to my actually getting engaged that boyfriend and I will probably be marrying in .  The second and third times he acted like that was the first time he heard of it and stated that he doesnt like surprises and would like to be forewarned of this sort of news.  How he wants for anyone to warn him of a marriage discussion without disclosing that its a marriage discussion I have no fucking clue.  The third time was even my boyfriend informing my dad of his intent to marry me so I figured the actual engagement announcement would at least not be complete surprise.So we get engaged I put off telling my parents because I know their reaction will be negative.  When I do my dad flips out again telling me that he wants to be warned of these things and how Im telling him only after the fact.  I was not aware of any custom where the father of the bride must be privy to the datetimelocation of the proposal.  He took this as a sign that I would elope and not tell him of the wedding until after its done with and would not listen to reason though he could not refute my rebuttals on how ridiculous he was being.  Then  minutes of yelling later it was like we never had the argument.Im anticipating that when I try to actually talk wedding plans with him hes going to be all surprised again.  Its like some fucking weird gaslighting.,wedding,cpnef52,5,t5_2qhtr

3979648,0,t1_cr9m20y,I think YOURE missing the point. Your original post says it is the best thing youve ever done and you tell men to do it. In this comment you have said you understand that it isnt for everyone which is definitely NOT the tone of the original post. You may be right in saying it shows respect to the father of the bride but unless your bride agrees with this tradition and fewer women do as time goes on then it does not show respect to her. If my fiance had asked my family before me I would have been both livid that he asked someone else for permission about one of the most important decisions I am ever going to make about MY life who I marry and upset that he didnt know me well enough to understand that I would have been mad. Thankfully we are both on the same page. The fact that in a previous post you said that you would have reconsidered if he had said no is very sad. Its nice that you had a good experience with this and I hope that your fiance has a similar viewpoint to you but please recognise that this is really not what a lot of women and men want so your urging out of context of peoples personal feelings and relationships is a little inappropriate.Actions only become tradition because it what was always done. Social progress means changing some of these actions as society deems them inappropriate. It used to be the case that women were not educated or allowed to vote. It used to be the case that LGBT individuals were persecuted. It used to be the case that wealthy families owned slaves...,wedding,cr9wvi5,3,t5_2qhtr

4315136,0,t3_3aejap,Usually I take the side of the bride with these situations and say fuck them its your day blah blah. However in your situation I feel like you need to talk for real as a group and lay it out on the table for the sake of your parents. It sounds like you have an amazing honeymoon trip to look forward to regardless of how the wedding goes. It was your decision in the beginning to include your cousin and while it obvious she is a huge jealous bitch you gotta find some common ground. Call her up for a meeting and lay down the ground rules. She has had her wedding day already and if she was unsatisfied with it then that is her problem and she should not be trying to take things away from yours. Jealousy is an ugly thing especially between family. ,wedding,csc1k4e,8,t5_2qhtr

Congrats on your marriage. Edit to add my guess would be he assumed it was a destination wedding and you were having a second line just because New Orleans. He tends to rag on anyone not from there. Its a schtick and not at all personal. There used to be a regular commenter who was a dick to tourists asking stupid questions and deleted his account in December.

4649340,0,t3_3enjtw,I think its wrong if the in laws to ask for money after the fact especially since they said they intended to gift you the wedding. However since they are not asking for money I think you should set up a repayment plan with them and then pretty much never take any offer from them again. if they want their money back it should be in your terms not theirs dont let them touch your wedding gifts. Have a friend or grooms side family member collect the gifts and transport them to your home if youre going straight to your honey moon. Im really sorry youre going through this stress. Some people always want to create drama be you have to put a stop to it. If they want their money then they need to talk to you after the wedding and drop it for now as to not upset your wife to be.,wedding,ctgm1bm,79,t5_2qhtr

Engagement party is a bit different because its not traditionally a gift giving event but you still will probably end up with questions and hurt feelings from some people if you can deal with it thats the event that they should be invited to if they have to be invited. If I were in your shoes Id just ask my mom to have an informal bbq after the wedding to party with my extended family not specifically a wedding event and not making memy fianc the center of attention just a fun party and itll give the people who couldnt be invited to your wedding a chance to congratulate you and also give you a giftcard if they feel like it. ,wedding,ctqcxub,7,t5_2qhtr

If you want to get her a gift and you know she likes Kate Spade go for it. You probably know her better than you think and definitely better than us strangers on Reddit.

She never told you not to have a lap dance and you didnt cheat on her but instead of talking it out shes threatening to end the relationship?  Thats not a marriage in the making.  You dont just call it off every time one or the other of you gets their feelings hurt.  You should know your chick to know well enough whats going to piss her off but lets say you are just clueless and never considered it.  Lets say she was naive as to the workings of strip clubs so she didnt lay out any ground rules... how is this an impasse?  My FH isnt into strip clubs. The only times he has even been in our entire relationship has been my idea. Its harmless. Anyone whos had a lap dance knows its basically just awkward. You dont know what to do with your hands because you cant touch them and some weird glittery skank is rubbing her possibly questionalbe bits on you.  Strippers arent usually the dimes they portray on TV.... its not really all that hot to have some stretch marked tattooed mother of two grinding on your knee.

6330459,0,t3_427wgd,I just had my first wedding hair consultation in Santa Cruz a little north of Big Sur thought the pricing might help you figure out your makeup costs.This is at a midend salon the stylist charges tip for her cuts. I regularly get my hair cut here and really like the place.Her travel fee for Saturdays is  for within  miles with more charges for distances past that. For the bride makeup starts at  and hair at . Bridesmaid makeup and hair starts at  each. Trial costs are hr she said to expect about . hours for my trial. She did say that the more people getting their hairmakeup done the more she will reduce the travel fee basically because its more worth her time.Based on these prices for just me to get my hair done plus a trial Im looking at  . This was my first trial so the only comparison I have is the bridesmaid hair cost for a friend her stylist is charging us tip per bridesmaid for hair only for the wedding this spring in Santa Cruz. One thing to remember is that there is nothing in Big Sur. Literally nothing no cell phone service no shops no gas. Just metric tons of tourists. Anyone that has to travel in for your wedding has several hours each way where they arent working in their normal salon and thats a pretty big income loss to them. So expect very large travel fees. If theyre local expect tourist tax  As a suggestion depending which side of Big Sur youre going to be on pick the nearest town and travel there yourself to get things like makeup done.,wedding,cz97cba,1,t5_2qhtr

Their only responsibilities or duties are to show up on the day of the wedding relatively sober in the appointed dress. I think all this other stuff about bridal parties having jobs amp expenses other than dress is perpetuated by the wedding industry to get all of us to spend more money. The brides who fall prey to this notion of a BP being unpaid help are typically the ones with an inward focus at best and the Bridezilla gene at worst. In my experience a personal attendant is a made up position to placate someone who isnt close enough to the bride to be a bridesmaid. I know plenty of people who were given this honor who had a miserable time gophering for a demanding bride or doing the job of DOC wo the benefit of a paycheck. ,wedding,czqa7iy,2,t5_2qhtr

6793985,0,t1_d0mdcpu,We decided with no parents because my biological parents dont talk. My mom despises my dad and would be extremely hurt and disappointed if he were there and I dont want to put her through that. In addition to that she would have to travel from Japan where she lives just for a weekend that I wouldnt really be able to spend time with her.  its really not that I dont want the parents to be there its just easier for everyone IMO if we just had separate casual receptions in the two states so the only traveling done would be my fianc and I. Edit In addition to all of that I dont think I could deal with having his mom there and mine not. Its not that I dont want my mom there its just easier for her to not come and it wasnt a big deal for her either.

6836626,0,t1_d0r4uie,Agreed. I was MOH for my best friend. Her bridesmaids were unresponsive or took weeks to get back to me. I wound up saying something to the bride apologized for having to do so and gently asked she give them a nudge without trying to throw them under the bus. She said something to them about wondering if theyd gotten my messages because I hadnt heard back and that was all it took!Edit I also coordinated with the bride for all of us to get together and hang out a couple times to get to know each other and help with wedding crafts. I was only  hours away and everyone else was at least half as close. I could then trap them into making plans and collect. ,wedding,d0r8fhs,3,t5_2qhtr

6902542,0,t1_d0ynwh1,I actually fell in love with one of her Fall  dresses Jim Hjelm by Hayley Paige I showed that to the bridal assistant at RK Bridal Salon in NY saying that was my dream dress but couldnt pay for it. She was BEYOND enthusiastic saying she had an even better one for me and to not worry at all and boy was she right!Jim Hjelm by Hayley Paige Spring  Daffodil no belt for me though. Looks way different on me than the model which just goes to show that no bride should be too swayed by a model pic or how it looks on the hanger... My  ABSOLUTE musts for the assistant was NO BEADSGLITTER NO LACE. The other thing I was adamant about was that i wanted straps... The lady convinced me that getting thin lil spaghetti straps at an angle would be no problem for any alterator using fabric taken from the bottom... Which is my other main thing I would like to warn any bride DO NOT let straps make or brake your dress search I really stressed over this and it made looking at dresses online almost impossible since strapless is pretty much the standard now you can get straps added to almost any dress you want.The other crazy thing about finding my dream dress this was the first day I ever looked the first dress I tried on at the second store I went to I didnt try on another one! When I was pulling it up it wasnt zipped or clipped even I yelled OMG this is it! The assistant said I was her dream bride because of how my reaction is the way she wants every bride to react. She sees so many women who go back and forth for hoursdays between  dresses and she always wants to tell them Unless you have that sweeping feeling right from the second its on you dont get it!,wedding,d0ypzwv,2,t5_2qhtr

Breaking up with a boyfriend is easier than a fianc and breaking up with a fianc is easier than a husband. Imagine how you would have felt if you found this out in  months or  years. You may be out of pocket BUT you didnt stand there in front of everyone and vow your love and commitment.You can save that moment for someone who deserves it and yes you will find someone noone knows where or when but you will and it will be worth going through all this sht and being single for a few more years.Feel sad feel angry feel decieved.

7382515,0,t3_4gf3gs, Are you in the US or one of the other countries that recognizes internet officiants? If so one of your mutual friends could get ordained in short order. My fiance is ordained in the Church of Universal Life. If youd rather have a smaller ceremony you may need to go it alone or with your parents half  whatever you can scrape together  perhaps your fiance should let her know that. Additionally if you say no kids for the ceremonyreception sounds like thatll limit it  if thats something you want to do.Youre already considering nontraditional venues  there are others. Some state and local parks rent areas for varying costs varies A LOT  a park near me now rents a large pavillion for just  USD when I lived in FL nothing was under  USD. Also some less traditional venues can be cheaper than others.  Mismatched parties are a lot weirder if youre going the traditional church wedding route. Also what if you had some bridesmen? One of my closest friends is a dude so hes standing up there with me on my side. Restrooms are a must and nicer restroom trailers can be pricey. Again if youre not absolutely committed to the family farm idea another nontraditional venue might be a better idea. Do not discount the possibility of elopement or a Vegas wedding. Honestly theyre cheaper than youd think your friends can skype in. OK I know that probably wasnt what you wanted to hear. I got engaged in December and didnt sleep a full night until sometime in January. Nerves are normal especially if your families are putting a lot of pressure on you. I highly recommend both the site and book Offbeat Bride. They actually used composting toilets but theyre more hippie than Im willing to go.

8363557,0,t3_4u4up1,While I wouldnt want my guests impeding the professionals or destroying anything by not paying attention I think it would be very rude to say something like Your photos or videos will NOT be nicer than the professionals. Anyone who is taking pictures is doing so out of kindness because they want to capture and remember this special day. My guests took bunches of pictures and I saw them as soon as the next day while the professional ones took  or so weeks. They never got in the way of my photographer or videographer and I value and cherish each picture that was shared with me. Of course the quality isnt as great as a professional but it doesnt need to be. As a professional I would expect you to be able to work with my guests. If my photographer had thrown a strop and said No cell photography allowed as it gets in my way he wouldnt have remained as my photographer. I paid him well to do his job and part of that is navigating guests if needed. If he couldnt cope with that hed be better off as a landscape photographer. ,wedding,d5mzvgb,17,t5_2qhtr

I have decided that I am probably going to go without any decorations in my head.  I am going to grow out just the top portion of my pixie and style it like one of these photos of Kelly Osbourne.      ,wedding,d62kz62,2,t5_2qhtr
8499638,0,t3_4w4qs0,This is a tough situation. I definitely see what youre saying regarding his BMs duties. If you are concerned about this have you talked to your FH about this to see if he thinks the gf will cause issues with his duties? Its possible you may be making a mountain out of a mole hill since guys are typically more laid back. As for not allowing the gf yes that would probably make you look bad could be hurtful to the BM and could possibly cause damage to FHBM relationship. Theres still time to find a spot for her and IMO I think that would be the right thing to do. I think instead of waiting for him to ask if he can bring her you should be proactive and let BM know shes invited. Take some time to remind him how much it means to your FH to have him as his BM. Sure he may take pics of the gf but I wouldnt doubt that he still takes pics of you both. Remember any extra photos are icing on the cake. Keep it classy and have a fantastic wedding! Best wishes! ,wedding,d6408z4,4,t5_2qhtr

8614801,0,t3_4xtya1,Honestly just elope. Destination or courthouse wedding. Your familyfriends may not understand now why they wouldnt be included but hopefully they will in the future. I cannot imagine how stressful your day would be with any of those people there. Still wear your dress for the elopement and you could even rent out a room in a restaurant or something to make use of your centerpieces and florals or decorate your hotel room. That way it still feels weddingy. Why does your fiance want a wedding with all that drama? Maybe you should elope now and if in the future your family and friends get their stuff together you could have a big anniversary or vow renewal celebration. Have you already sent out all your invitations? That may be the tricky part. But Im sure this has happened before. Maybe others have better advice but you could individually call or email everyone and explain that due to some family issues you dont want to discuss in detail you and FH have decided to elope. You cant wait to catch up with them afterwards to share all the details and photos of your wedding. Regarding the venue tell them your situation and ask if you could find  a couple to take your date if they would refund you some or all of your deposit you may have to compensate the new couple for helping  you out a bit.

People are going to have an issue with it since its not the same across the board and everyone can justify a reason why their child should be invited be prepared issues with nursing babies only they make a ton more noise than children and are completely uncontrollable no matter how good the parent. The wedding party being put ahead of the family will also cause issues. We drew the line of If your child isnt IN the wedding they cant come and some people got annoyed and didnt come others were pleased their kids werent invited and others came but were annoyed it was no kids but were more understanding when they saw there was NO ONE under  except for the flowergirl and ring bearer.

9388659,0,t3_596lvk,I agree with uchoppedgreenchile. Fianc shouldnt be mad at you but more upset that aunt invited herself. You should have some sort of narrative to give when people start asking questions. Its inevitable that word of yalls engagement will get spread regardless if yall shared the news or not. Two pieces of advice . Be firm with your plans and reiterate to parents. This is yalls wedding! Some family will ignore this but if youre consistent this will work in yalls favor. . Share little on fb if youre keeping it small. I learned my lesson the hard way when my MIL started sharing the few things I posted on fb and tagged people who werent invited to the wedding. When we realized she was inviting ppl to our wedding who we didnt know she made us uninvite them. It was fucking ridiculous. We had already told her our ideas and intentions and she totally ignored us. Its hard but dont compromise because you feel guilty! I think they may get some backlash but its the start of you and your fiancs life together... parents should learn early to let yall make your own decisions. The sooner you set this precedent the better. Best of luck! ,wedding,d962ukc,4,t5_2qhtr

Reading your post though it makes more sense Your wedding was small and your friendship with this woman starting gaining momentum only after the wedding details were finalized. It was too late to invite her to the wedding but you wanted to include her in the bachelorette party because you enjoy her company. I think it would go a long way to try to explain it to her like that and to apologize that it hurt her feeling.

9669942,0,t3_5dja84,As a plus one your job isnt t really worry about a gift thats the person actually invited which in this case is your friend. However it sounds like your friend is out of the loop too lolFirst step is to ask the couple if they are registered anywhere or if they arent ask them if they have a preference on what type of gift they want ie kitchen appliances bathroom stuff . If their response is We really dont care bring whatever then the next step would be to look for clues. Has the couple been planning on anything major like renovating the house? Then tools may be handy. Have they moaned about how disgusting their bedroom looks? Then get them new bedsheets. If all else fails and that still doesnt help then those Ninja Smoothie sets sounds like a great idea! I have a similar thing and I love mine. As for what you yourself can do You can show up on time NOT wearing white and have a great time! The couple has invited a plus one for a reason they want your friend to be comfortable and have fun so you can support that. The worst thing for a bride and groom is an empty dance floor so unless the music is god awful make sure you get up and dance. Usually the bride and groom have a receiving line after the ceremony or they go table to table at the reception to thank everyone for coming. However if they dont do this then it may be nice to go to them at some point at the reception to go up to the couple and thank them for inviting you and to give them your well wishes. Just please do not go up to them when they are eating dinner or doing their special couple stuff like cutting the cake and first dance. Wait until after all the formalities of speeches dances etc are over and thank them then. And lastly do not wear white! Unless you know for a fact that the bride is not wearing a white dress you said it was mixed race wedding so if for example the Bride was Chinese well white is very unlucky in chinese culture and brides wear red instead. Good luck and have fun at your first wedding!,wedding,da50ud3,7,t5_2qhtr

Like I dont know if they kept forgetting how old I was or the fact that I was in HIGHSCHOOL still but I dont know.  The adults as in my mom my aunt and uncle only really stepped in the weekend of the wedding when they saw some of the stuff first hand but by then it was too late my sister and the other MOH made a comment at the reception about how lucky I was that the bride offered to pay for our hair and makeup that day or I would have had to put it on my emergency credit card... the elders were like ...exCUSE ME??Im clearly still a little salty about it just because Im realizing this doesnt seem to be the norm and it could have been a MUCH happier experience but Im trying to use it as a learning experience to just be more understanding towards others life stages and their finances when it comes to events like this.,wedding,ddb32fm,3,t5_2qhtr

You might want to look into this anyway you cant live the rest of your life hiding from public events.     I think that discussing it with the groom and new best man and telling them youre having health issues and not sure you can be the best bestman possible is a good option. It allows you some privacy not to have to detail the problems youre having to everyone but it also allows you to skip the party if its a really bad day or just got a few hours and not drink etc. ,wedding,ddqznel,1,t5_2qhtr

10912393,0,t1_de3yj2i,I agree I would feel hurt. But also i think it would depend on the size of the bridal party? Im only having  bridesmaids so obviously I would be upset but if OP is one of  bridesmaids then her leaving early would be significantly less impactful.,wedding,de5jax3,1,t5_2qhtr

11082370,0,t1_deo63hd,Ive never had a plus one who didnt also know the couple so that probably plays into my thought process.

11153251,0,t1_dew79xa,Thanks for your input! We will be paying for everything and she seems so easy going with options originally but she gives me longer and longer requirements for the dress so I can only imagine what a debacle the hair and makeup will be.

11297019,0,t1_dfc2cdz,I went in to the shop between classes just because I wanted to see what styles looked best on me. Told the lady what kind I definitely didnt want nothing strapless and she went and grabbed a handful. Hit it with my third dress but I just had to look at the first two to know I didnt like them and didnt even try them on they were too much floofyness. And to be even luckier they just happened to be having their  off tent sale and the dress was an as is off the rack dress which added an additional  off of the price.

11367251,0,t3_626ck9,Yeah dont let your parents opinions dictate how you plan YOUR wedding. Different people have very different opinions. FH and I both have divorced and remarried parents so we have four sets to deal with. Three of the four of them have OPINIONS My dad and step mom want some kind of backyard rager with too much alcohol and not enough food like theirs was. My mom thinks Im crazy for getting married in the mountains and is very picky about accommodations. FMIL wanted us to get married in a park next to a freeway lol. FH and I got financial contributions from his mom who when we were firm about having a nicer wedding had a ton of CBF but stopped pushing my mom who is now trying to kiss up and saying she loved everything from the beginning lol and HIS dad and stepmom who are contributing the most out of all the parents but their only big opinions so far have been its your wedding do what you want and sounds cool! Im rambling at this point but basically put it this way  the whole traditional parents make big choices thing is waaaay outdated even if your parents were helping to pay for your wedding. Since YOU TWO are the sole financial contributors its up to you. What does your fianc say about this whole thing? Does he agree with you or with parents? It can be hard to fight a partner on it mine initially wanted something very small and simple but if youre both in agreement its easier to be firm with parents. I basically told FH the same thing  we only get to have one wedding. I dont want to regret anything about it or make any decisions I dont like just because one set of parents didnt like it. Im not willing to compromise on a once in a lifetime event thats about US. ,wedding,dfkgfal,3,t5_2qhtr

11396208,0,t3_62jfa4,No. However if youre close to this cousin and happy that theyve found someone they want to spend the rest of their life with Id at least send a card. If they had an affordable gift on their registry Id probably send that too but thats just because Id want to contribute to their beginning their lives together not out of obligation.    Weddings are expensive doubley so in HCOL areas. If theyre paying for the wedding themselves itd make a lot of financial sense to move it to an off day. It also makes sense to plan it in the city they live in.  of my extended family is in Canada but that doesnt mean Im going to have my wedding there. Yes it may be inconsiderate to people who have to travel but in the end its youre cousin and their partners wedding day. If their wedding was on a Saturday in San Francisco would you send a gift?  ,wedding,dfnqtu0,4,t5_2qhtr
11486783,0,t3_63tc5e,We each picked one type of alcohol. He chose a beer he liked and I chose Sangria because it works well mixed but also good on its own. Originally I wanted to do specialty bride and groom mixed drinks but in order to keep cost down it was better to pick some stand alone drinks and soft drinks and water. ,wedding,dfy0xbi,3,t5_2qhtr

Shes painted herself into a corner. Either  shell change her mind.  shell copy you and it will suck  no explanation needed  or it will be a creepy carbon copy which people will note. Only makes her look bad. Or  it will be bigger better fancier than your wedding... because she attended yours and has to oneup you. People will also notice that not in a good way for her.I think youre good no matter what.,wedding,dg2wfur,2,t5_2qhtr
