3621860,0,t3_31rcd3,I guess my question wasnt clear I dont mean to ask HOW to do it Im asking currently today  April  how many webVR pages link to how many others pages ideally with different authors.,WebVR,cq54a8m,1,t5_33ble
3622431,0,t1_cq56fpq,Janus is a full web browser built from the ground up for VR use. Its not the WebVR API setup chrome and FF uses but its within the same ballpark.  Its definitely the web in VR just not via WebVR.,WebVR,cq56mg0,2,t5_33ble

6613479,0,t3_466g5s,I assume youre using the DK HMD is that correct? Have you installed Oculus ... runtime and read through the Release Notes Readme and Troubleshooting documents on the Chromium builds share?Have you been able to get your HMD working with other VR demossoftware before trying WebVR just to make sure it works?I havent tried using VR on Linux for a while. Maybe uhaagch can help if I cant.,WebVR,d03e1mc,1,t5_33ble

8060125,0,t1_d4lfv6d,If I am not mistaken you have an intel HD  integrated GPU. I remember the cable center stuff you did in Janus and Im sorry it doesnt run for you anymore but that GPU is ancient.That wont work for almost any new modern rendering engine because its open GL .on windows.,WebVR,d4m1849,4,t5_33ble
9867155,0,t1_datdsl5,Thanks for pointing out AFrame.  Does it work OK with millions of triangles?gt Id like more info on how you skinned it.I use a drone to take s of pictures and then run the pictures through Agisofts PhotoScan  You need a powerful computer to do this in a reasonable time.  Big models can take days to process.gt This is a bit of a leap but I dont think so  because the camera is fixed. I dont know what you mean by the camera is fixed.  You can wander the model that I have linked.  What I want to know is if it looks good when you wear Vive or Oculus.  I tried Oculus with a different smaller model about  years ago and it seemed OK.,WebVR,datpoi9,1,t5_33ble

10784005,0,t1_dds5ih5,Yea I didnt intend to share this so publicly till it was more P of something I could show P. The neat thing is if you share it with friends they will all be in the room with you. I plan on experimenting with multiplayer rooms. ,WebVR,ddsai9l,1,t5_33ble
11109138,0,t3_5ym1iq,I would say the exact opposite. There are millions more VR users on mobile than on desktop.,WebVR,der7m1j,1,t5_33ble
