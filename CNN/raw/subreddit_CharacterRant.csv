Jim Lee makes everything into armor and adds lines everywhere while Rocafort just overloads on the Scifi bits and over designs it. I like their art but their costumes leave a bit to be desired. An example of a costume I like is Ninjak It looks like something out of a comic book but at the same time it looks like it actually has some functionality.

If something is in her range and standing still she can shoot it. If she shoots at Batman hell dodge it and her power will already know what movement he dodged it with and account for that in her next shot so the only question is whether multiple shots will put him off balance. Her only limits should be how fast she can move her hand and how fast she can pull the trigger. She doesnt need to see him move and adjust her aim her power does it for her.I will say Im not completely sure she can beat him Im mostly arguing that her power is more complex than perfect aim its also putting him in the a position in which he cant defend himself.Edit  Maybe Bob Munden is a good example?,CharacterRant,ctxoglw,1,t5_35frv

5233292,0,t3_3mmjne,A few things as i just watched itno stars were detsroyed just a planet and asteroid fieldit was explicitly stated that the universe collapsing would destroy both Beerus and Goku so that means no universal durability.  it was also stated that the shockwaves somehow gained power the further away they got. This is why people on earth only got knocked over while other planets were destroyed. Ground zero shockwaves were weak af.  Goku did not match universe destroying power and Beerus did not demonstrate it. Weirdly the shockwaves generated from the fight just got stronger the further they went which threatened to destroy the universe because they would keel getting stronger. Goku stopped this by striking at beerus with the same power that beerus was striking him. He did not use his ki to soften the shockwaves Toriyama just doesnt understand physics. Neither have universal striking power because neither started to hit softer yet the universe was not destroyed that was all the weird shockwaves.

Thats actually pretty nice.But then random metal syringes pierce her skin. What? Shes easily taken captive by the military and I mean easily. Sure they got Kryptonite but my goodness. She just falls unconscious in less than a second and they somehow got it through her skin with the aforementioned random metal.Then a random military helicopter chases away the bad guy. Just a random military helicopter.And then in the big fights they display combat speed on par with an average human. An average human. Just shoot them! They arent faster than a drunken arrow!Now the plane feat we dont know how much was her.  Oh they threw each other through walls a bit during a fight. She even split a car in half once by throwing the bad guy at it. That was vaguely impressive and her best concrete feat. But I still doubt shes even a  tonner.

I didnt mean  to give off that impression.My issue with this proof? It has no sense of scale. Its true that strength scales with ki. Ops right that if you are higher in ki you can physically overpower your opponent. But nothing op said proved that a punch is  to a ki attack. It just proves that their opponents respond equally to a ki attack as they do a punch.But Goku apparently couldnt lift  tons. Even in the Saiyan Saga where basically everyone was planetbusting with ki they struggled in x gravity. When they strike really hard they dont really do a lot of damage to the environment.OP did absolutely nothing to explain away this inconsistency. Because it does seem like an inconsistency they can punch like planet busters but they cant lift a couple bigrigs?Can you link the Chun thread? I checked out of that one after people crawled out of the woodwork to insult flutter over not realizing that Chun was Roshi in a scan.

He is basically going over how he can make sure the characters dont ramble on and can work on the dialogue now that someone else is drawing it.Well I mean it shows that he puts consideration into what his characters are saying. What they say is deliberate. Take that as you will.gtAnd i legitimate thought they had a more solid claim these claims are shaky at best and if you take them at face value they are downright wrong with what people are suggesting they mean.Thats not entirely true. It lends legitimacy to what theyre saying but its not definitive. gtThe first set i was shown was just him explaining that he likes to pair up characters so they can give each others backstory and this post is him just saying he can work on the dialogue better now that hes not drawing and can thus not waste sentences.Neither have anything to do with him talkingnarrating through his characters and neither support the claim that his character statements are stronger than other series because of this. The only time he even vaguely mentions Narration and characters is for their backgroundspersonality. Which has nothing to do with the subject at hand.Its him talking about how their statements and conversations are deliberate. I think there was actually and interview where he says he uses narration. Ill see if i can find that. Akira Toriyama Special InterviewgtVegeta and Nappa. Kibito and Kaishin when they first appear these characters certainly do often come in pairs.gtThat way Im able to explain the characters and their relationship to each other through their interactions. In my case I feel that it isnt good to insert too much narration. I suppose Goku and Bulma are representative of that.gtAh now that you mention it youre right!gtAs a child Goku doesnt know anything of the world so without Bulma hed be a character who didnt say anything. laughsgtI see! So that relationship has been firmly passed down to the relationship between Beerus and Whis.gtFor parts like where he wakes up for the first time in  years Whis clarifies things for the sake of exposition.

7436925,0,t3_4h5e4z,We should assume Anime on the sub since its the most indepth and gives us more to work with. If you want to use manga or movies then include a prompt in the description. The issue with mixing them together is that you end up with inconsistencies. The  tons feat doesnt really matter considering lifting! striking. The main issue is that the fights happen differently. The end result is the same but the feats during the fights are different. Also theres the issue of omission in the manga. When it comes to something like Beerus vs Champa that scene is manga only but its a flashback and doesnt contradict or cause issue with the animes telling of the story. Something like that is probably OK but the tournament fights are not since they are different.

So why the fuck are you arguing that logic defying feats are meaningless when the sub already accepts meaningless feats?!?!gt Do you actually know what the laws of logic are? Conceptually you cannot go say a  sided shape only has three sides or else it would be something else. I suppose a universe can use the word rectangle to describe a triangle but if they use our application of rectangle a  sided shape cannot possible be a triangle. Because of the shape had  sides it would be a rectangle.Except a fictional character of my creation can do that regardless of whether its logical or not. We already agree that the feat makes no sense. What we dont seem to agree about is whether or not WWW should use it. I say yes. If you think no petition the mods and stop fucking arguing this shit.gt There are several constraints in fiction that are not limited to this. You are trying to compare something like a triangle actually having four sides to giving someone reality warping powers or some shit. Im not going to follow this red herring  go back and read Verluxs character rant it replies to this point and every point youve made thus far.I mean physical constraints.

I believe Sanjis relativistic feats can all be interpreted as aimdodging Ivankovs as reacting before the laser is fired and Whitebeards and Rayleighs interrupting Kizarus lightspeed travel is just weird while being near impossible to take away doubt they hit Kizaru before he travels.

The comparison looks similar in size to the few tips of ice mountains that were cut along with the facility for both anime and manga versions. As the mountains were to the facility those tips paled in comparison to the facility up close. So he should be mountain cutter at least. I dont know... he didnt really have a facial expression that sort of showed that he put his full force into that cut which looks of mountain slicing capability. But im pretty sure he did his best to take down doffy so im sure a couple of those slashes in the room that the strings blocked were of the same calibre perhaps even stronger but i can only speculate for now.

Adding needless filler drops in animation quality all over the damn place and the characters models looking pretty bad.gtThe show is funDragon ball has a pretty simplistic plot but it fits the target demographic so its forgivable considering the length of the series. But adding ridiculous amount of slow dialogue to complete the shallow story is bad. The manga is proof that a lot of the dialogue isnt needed because it gets across the core ideas in a fraction of the time the anime did. I would give some merit to some of the comedic aspects but the comedy style isnt quite something I personally appreciate as much. So if I were to enjoy the series it would have to be the fight scenes and family aspects mainly. So at the very least put more effort into animating the fights. The choreography is shit and animation is shit plain and simple. People say oh no its good but theyre looking at it from a fucking power level standpoint. They add impact by shaking the screen or shaking the character models. They dont draw god damn impact frames. Are you serious? Thats a lazy way to add impact.You can probably say oh its because TOEI is shit. But guess what Toei also animates One Piece and Precure which are also both long running shows and most of their core fight scenes there have fucking impact frames if only briefly.All I can say is Toei is milking DB and you can see it in the quality of the animation.

IMHO he might not have it but still carries some powers from it the guy was levitating in the last and used some of the powers in boruto. Thats enough to get anybody thinking...Naruto never levitated in the Last if Naruto had his flying powers he would have flown to Toneri instead of use clones to try to catch him. Also he didnt use any SoP powers in the movie.gtI think that some sage of six path power is merged inside naruto if that makes sense  hence the differences in his KCM forms to what they were before  and doesnt really come as a mode anymore. But i dont really know anything that can solidify my thoughts its just a matter of speculation from my side.Its all speculation however theres more evidence that he doesnt have it then he does.gtAlthough you did tell me that naruto is faster than lightning and then i come to find out it was just a reaction feat something preskip luffy could do casually... like what the hell man?Pretty sure you misinterpreted my words. Ive never said Naruto runs as fast as lightning. He can move his arms faster than lightning and react to lightning. His best travel speed is during KCM when he outran  Bijuudama by pretty much  times.gtWait what did that quote say?he Nine Tails was still living inside Naruto. There were also remnants of the other  Bijuu inside him as well. In that way you could say he was a human pillar for the power of the Ten Tails. In the last war Obito had become a human pillar for the Ten Tails and gained chakra rivalling that of the Sage of the Six Paths.

We see onscreen what she did. She shot her magical arrows through spacetime and they went to each Magical girl where she then took away their grief keeping them from becoming a Witch. The whole plot of Rebellion hinges on their still being witches because the Incubators trap Homura so that when Madoka comes to get her and keep her from becoming a witch they can trap her.Well I mean she did prevent witches from happening except the Incubators found a workaround. Which is a decent feat. I guess you could call it a conditional omnipresence attack presence since her arrow selves can be anywhere that a witch is about to form. Its very specific though. gtThat same movie we see Madoka physically traveling down to Homura.tbf Homura was a special case. With the others she just used her time traveling arrows.

They create these massively powerful reality warpers like Clyde Wyncham or Mad Jim Jaspers and arguably the aforementioned Nate Grey who isnt in the same league but is still quite powerful just due to Mutant  vaguely advanced science from a guy who doesnt even rate when people talk about the top minds in Marvel. and then it turns out they just happened to be born that way and theoretically any baby on Earth could turn out to be able to order literal cosmic gods around like its nothing.
