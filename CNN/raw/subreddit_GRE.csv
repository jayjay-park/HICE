7280278,0,t3_4e4l4s,Any feed back is welcome. Rip me to shreds please!TopicSome people believe that government needs to subsidize and fund research in the technology sector so that new technological advancements can be realized. Other people believe that government funding of research that leads to technological advancements is detrimental and that advances in technology should instead be driven by competition in industry.InstructionsWrite a response in which you discuss which view you agree with more. Be sure to explain your reasoning for your position. In developing and supporting your stance you should address both of the views that are presented in the passageWhile funding for technological research arises from a hybrid of government and privatesector sources some parties argue that research funding should primarily come from only one of these two sources. Proponents of government based funding may state that innovation driven my competition will effectively eliminate important niche research areas which are not likely to be highly profitable. Those with the opposing view might state that if research is not profitable it is not necessary. While each side presents compelling arguments the author proposes that even though an area of research is important the results of the research will not provide sustainable benefits to society without the presence of a marketdrive demand. While government funding may be important to seed research a new product or technology cannot benefit the public without continued financial support to fully realize not just research but manufacture and distribute a marketable product . Innovation driven by competition inherently leads to such self sustaining technology.  This is  because roducts tailored to the needs of a free market have the advantage of a readymade customer base. Consumption of the technology which is produced leads to profit thus providing a basis for more research and improvement.  In a scenario where research for a technology which is not in demand is funded by the government many discoveries will not be sustainable due to lack of an identified customer.For existing technologies competition leads to not only to brand new discoveries but also technilogical advancements in the form of incremental improvements in existing products. In order to gain an edge over competitors offering similar products a company will natural expend in order to improve quality and decrease costs. This motivating factor has driven the discovery of countless inventions and processes.Government funding may be beneficial to initiate research in a given area but the advancements may not be of any benefit without satisfying some consumer need within a technological industry. Even aside from new advances competition provides innovation in the form of incremental improvements to quality and by driving down costs. ,GRE,d25pwb1,1,t5_2qy5d

I also found the verbal section in Manhattans pretty close to the one in official GRE guide but dont rely solely on this.I took a trial of Magoosh prep my experience was that the questions in quant and verbal are certainly harder compared to ETS this is actually a good thing because you wont face any surprises on the test day.Finally Id rate the diagnostic tests in Manhattans around mediumeasy.

8838209,0,t3_50ylih,It sounds to me like you need to drill a little deeper with your quant prep. Most students learn the rules for a given topic e.g. standard deviation and then answer  or  questions before moving on to a new topic. If you want a deep understanding of each math concept you need to tackle a wide range of questions all related to that concept. This allows you to see all of the different ways the testmakers can test your understanding. Our free GRE course is designed to help students gain the level of proficiency they need to achieve their particular target scores. So for example on the video lesson page for quadrilaterals we have links to  questions all related to quadrilaterals. In my opinion this is the best way to increase your quant score.
