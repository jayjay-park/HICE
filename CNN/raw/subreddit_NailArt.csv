Ger her some nail brushes the really thin ones for decorating then dotting tools as well as strips and tape stickers aaand some other stuff. These are all the things I have a little drier may come in handy too as nail art is layered and can take a long time to dry As well as one of these quick dry drops or spraysShop around and youll find them for lower prices.If you have time buy them on eBay thats where I always get them. They get shipped from Chine or Hong Kong and super low prices. Ive bought  nail dotting tools for  including shipping and lots and lots more. A  wheel of nail decals stickers and whatnot for  cents.,NailArt,cmf2xs5,1,t5_2s8x2
5032414,0,t3_3jveb5,Ive used the Sally Hansen type and I dont think a top coat is necessary. Ive seen a topcoat cause the sticker to discolor a bit actually.Ive never used jamberry but I would guess it would be similar.I would maybe use a top coat if the edge starts to chip or peel a bit.When using water transfers though I would definitely use a top coat. Or if the sticker doesnt cover your entire nail like a decal or French tip for example then use a top coat.Source limited experience decorating my own nails.,NailArt,cusli9e,1,t5_2s8x2
