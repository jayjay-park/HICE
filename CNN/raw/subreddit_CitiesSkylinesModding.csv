3429637,0,t1_cpj5179,I cant begin to state how thankful I am that the situation wasnt worse.I seriously underestimated just how much control a modder has over not just the game but the entire OS itself.Given that the problem wasnt worse Ive since been able to breathe a sigh of relief and while I am not happy that this has happened I am at least grateful that the situation can instead fulfill a public service announcement to modders and modusers MOD USERS   Wait until a mod is publicly validated before subscribing to it!  rCSModAudits will confirm for you the validity of many of the most popular mods.rCSModAudits MOD DEVELOPERS Get a thirdperson perspective on your code before posting.  It doesnt matter who just so long as they are verifiable.  I made this mistake and look what happened.I strongly feel that in the unique case of Cities Skylines with its unsandboxed mods that Steam not just should but must implement a vetting process for all submitted mods Excluding of course assets maps and color correction.  The Unity Asset Store features a system like that.  All Unity Assets upon submission to the Asset Store are placed in a queue.  When first in line an asset is thoroughly examined by a panel of their inhouse experts.  This vetting process takes days.  At any point the moment you make a change to your published asset no matter how small you move yourself to the back of the line.  As frustrating as this may sound this is how it needs to be done for everyones safety.  It is only if they give the thumbsup to a new asset or revision of an asset that the posting then becomes publicly listed.  Thus the Unity Asset Store prevents situations like Bordercities from ever occurring.  Steam needs to do the same because at this rate I feel it wont be long before there is an allout fiasco over this.  The guys over at rCSModAudits can only do so much and they deserve all the thanks they can get for volunteering their time and energy to this absolutelyessential procedure one of which Steam should have had in place from the start for any game with Workshop content and scriptbased modding.,CitiesSkylinesModding,cpj7d7s,7,t5_3742z

4660264,0,t1_cthnv0g,Really thats your house ? What a coincidence I made that screenshot a few days ago. It looks good so I decided to have it displayed in the preview.The family member count is calculated from the density the size of the plot and the level. The buildings dont have a family count property.This mean that some building will have different values because their backfront yard can be extended. For instance a x building can occupy a x plot and thus have a bigger family count.I know it doesnt make sense but thats how CO decided to go. I think it is that way so its the zoned area that matters regardless of what building actually grow.For the recoloring yeah thats missing. I could add it but its not a priority. It sure would be nice in addition to the preview to be able to visualize what the different colours look like.,CitiesSkylinesModding,cthzebs,1,t5_3742z
