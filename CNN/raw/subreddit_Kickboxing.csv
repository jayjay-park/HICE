I cant really remember a fight of theirs Ive gone back to rewatch since the exodus of Saki Spong and Ghita.If you want to watch great fights I would go back to the old K WGP and MAX events.   WGP and  MAX are my favorites. In terms of more recent stuff K Japan is pumping out by far the most entertaining shows with a focus on lighter weight classes. Here are some from the last year just to get you startedkg Championship Quarterfinal Kaew Fairtex vs Yamazakikg Championship Final Taiga vs Takerukg Championship Semifinal Yamazaki vs Ilias Bulaidkg Championship Title fight Urabe Hirotaka vs Urabe Koyakg Championship Title fight Takeru vs Charles Bongiovanni   kg Superfight Minoru vs Massaro Glunderkg Japan Championship Semifinal Yuta Kubo vs Yamazaki,Kickboxing,d69i25t,5,t5_2s5hr

As another commenter said its all about knowing when to throw those kicks. I had to take a break from Muay Thai because of my coaches chronic back issues in the mean time i took up Kyokushin Karate and my shins became iron.

10037606,0,t1_dbfvunj,Which one? They just kept colliding erratically. What were any of those kicks targeting? I maybe saw one that could be considered a legit legkick.Neither one thought to get out of the way of a single blow. Its just plain irresponsible to let people fight without any defensive training. Great way to wreck a kid early. Sorry if this was someone close to you. Hatsoff for having the guts to get in a ring at  and all. ,Kickboxing,dbfxd0n,-1,t5_2s5hr

11792453,0,t3_66phpb,I would recommend finding a legit MMA striking coach who has a background in TKD if you want to learn some cool and effective stuff they dont emphasize in kickboxing. Duke Rufus is a good example. There are powerful kicks in TKD respected by kickboxers. MMA is starting to see some great techniques adopted from TKD.  Karate is okay but they focus on a lot of hand techniques and point style fighting that dont entirely translate to kickboxing.,Kickboxing,dgwpq5c,1,t5_2s5hr
