4720697,0,t1_ctpkbd9,The point is that this sub is riddled with spam and the moderator clearly has or wants nothing to do with it. I mean if you scroll down the first  pages are nothing but spam links. If you dont agree with the making of a new subreddit that will be taken care of and caressed like a newborn child free of spam and other nonsense so be it. Hide this post downvote if you wish and move on.  I assumed that the general consensus between the active users on this sub is that if the sole moderator isnt going to come back clean it up a bit and show it a little TLC is that a new subreddit is needed. I honestly dont give a shit if my new sub gains traction or not I did it for the subscribers of this sub that are sick of the spam and lack of moderation. I dont expect everyone to like the idea and I surely dont expect everyone to follow it. If people like the idea that will show in the following weeks. If people  such as yourself Im assuming  dont agree with it then that will show too.Well see what happens.,CelebOops,ctpl02q,12,t5_2x0gc
