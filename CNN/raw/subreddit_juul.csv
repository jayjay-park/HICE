8384319,0,t3_4tyfzw,They took a big turn in strategy this year when they switched focus from gas station to vape shops. They are starting to understand the market better and they know the public is interested in their nic and are exploring ways to give it to us. They have been putting these products in some peoples hands to get feedback and read peoples reactions. keep telling em what you want and soon it will come ,juul,d5pl6ub,1,t5_3b8j4

9518673,0,t3_5b7h1r,I have this with some refilled pods. I think it has to do with the cotton getting saturated by the mouth piece. Or the wicking deteriorating too much. This happens to me with some pods more than others. Refill juice is cheaper than pods so you arent at much of a lost. I only refill once per pod. ,juul,d9mdnpo,1,t5_3b8j4
9899159,0,t1_daxhjvh,Just contact PAX and tell them your JUUL isnt creating vapor or something. They have replaced  of my JUULs already. Easy peasy!,juul,daxvte4,1,t5_3b8j4

10784307,0,t3_5tovvk,Ok so I recently made some juice using wax and a product called Wax Liquidizer. It worked perfectly and Vapes from the Juul really well! The only problem I have is refilling the pods. Cant seem to consistently fill them without leaking.  out of  pods come out perfectly with no leaks but Im wasting pods and juice from this leaking problem. When filling the pod the juice leaks out the bottom where the contacts are located. Havent figured out why it only seems to work about th of the time. If someone has any tips preventing pods from leaking on the refill I would really appreciate it! Thanks in advance.,juul,ddsbmmr,2,t5_3b8j4

11210737,0,t3_600yib,It looks like you made this account just to ask so nobody should help you. With these regulations and all what proof do you have to verify you are old enough to buy these? We arent being dicks we are just in a critical time in vaping. If you could provide some kind of solid proof that you are of age I would be more than happy to help you any way I could. Im sure others would also.,juul,df2q362,4,t5_3b8j4

11584139,0,t1_dg8trdw,gtI think that chain vaping or running a pod completely dry is what leads to early pod failureThats actually what I was thinking too  it makes sense that either of these would cause a shorter pod life. How many refills are you getting out of those ones? Also happy cake day ,juul,dg92hy3,1,t5_3b8j4

11616072,0,t1_dgco0ud,Yeah. Youd have to use a nicotine base thats even more concentrated than mgml. Or find one thats already in a PGVG base. Otherwise the PG content will be way too high. ,juul,dgcox7v,1,t5_3b8j4
