My team is as followsMonster themeGotG Dr. DoomDP Green GoblinWoL Lyssa DrakWoL Black Hand Possessing GoblinOriginal Sinister Six ATA on Goblin copied by Doom. someodd points though I dont recall the exact amount right now.If anyone isnt aware. The ATA allows you to place a OSS token on a hit opposing characters card and OSS characters modify their attack by  for each token on a target character.My intention is to start pumping out ZVirus and OSS tokens early on through Dooms RSPW and Goblins EE which will be penetrating thanks to Black Hand.Lyssa Drak stays on the back line abusing her traited Probfromanywhere when likekeyworded friendlies are attacked.Mid game Goblin will carry an opposing character to her to utilize her Exploit Weakness if applicable.My main worry is that I may be relying too much on alphastrike to get out enough tokens.

Ill have to ask him again to see if he cheated during our game. PThe reasoning behind it is that Battle Fury states This character ignores Shape Change cant make ranged combat attacks cant be carried and cant be targeted by Incapacitate or Mind Control.Pulse Wave saysGive this character a ranged combat action even if it is adjacent to an opposing character the area of effect for this attack is half the characters range value. Draw lines of fire to all other characters within the area of effect including at least one opposing character these lines of fire ignore all game effects except for walls blocking and elevated terrain.Game effects possessed or used by characters with a line of fire drawn to them are ignored until the action has been resolved.

7128146,0,t1_d1ocafm,I have a feeling that the SI just takes too long to be effective in a modern age competitive tournament setting.  You just wont get far enough in the dial.  If you are considering using it basically just try and take advantage of the powers it gives and dont think youll get to the end.  That being said if you are trying to spin it all the way down you need someone who can make and hit lots of attacks.  If we werent restricting it to Modern I would say Brother Voodoo would be an amazing candidate since he makes free attacks.  Anyone who can make free attacks is a good choice.  Also Black Talon would be good to play on the team to make your SI user attack when they have  tokens.  Indomitability is a must for the SI user also.I was just thinking about it and Tiamat could be a good choice as he can get into a groove with constantly taking tokens off himself.  Apokolypse Supergirl could also be good in that she can potentially take tokens off herself when she attacks and has a free quake when she has  tokens.Could you use the Supreme Intelligence on another Supreme Intelligence?!?

7555242,0,t3_4itbwa,Okay!Keywords are the easiest so well start there. Every carded figure comes with a set of keywords with some rare exceptions Mr. Mxyzptlk comes to mind. These keywords are either Named such as Justice League or Avengers or Generic such as Soldier and Scientist. Named themes with one exception that I know of are limited to a specific universe. Marvel figures wont have the Gotham City keyword anymore than DC figures would have the SpiderMan Ally keyword. Generic keywords are cross universe. Notably there are both Marvel and DC figures with the Atlantis named keyword. Generic keywords are always italicized on the card so you can tell which one is which.A Theme Team is a set of figures that all share the same keyword. If the keyword shared amongst all the characters on your force is a Named Keyword you have a Named Theme Team. Similarly a shared Generic Keyword is a Generic Theme Team. If you have a Theme Team Named or Generic you get a bonus to your map roll of plus one for every character on your force. Additionally you may choose to pay for an Alternate Team Ability ATA when building your force. If you have a Named Theme Team you may also use Theme Team Probability Control TTPC but not if you just have a Generic Theme Team. TTPC will give you one use of TTPC for every character on your force up to the maximum build total divided by . So if you have a  point team consisting of the four TMNT Turtles you have  uses of TTPC  use per character up to the maximum amount allowed which is  in this case because it is a  point build and divided by ... you can do the math. TTCP works by allowing you to give a character that has not yet taken a nonfree action yet this turn an action token to use Probability Control. You can give out as many tokens as you have to give in a turn but a character can only use it once per turn. There is no limit on how many times a character can use it per game other than the total number of TTPC tokens available.If you have a Theme Team Named or Generic you may pay for an ATA with points during your force build. An ATA despite the name does not replace any Team Abilities your characters may have but does allow you to use additional abilities. An ATA will have a keyword requirement Robot for the Robot ATA for example but you do not have to have a Generic Theme Team using the Robot keyword to use the Robot ATA. You only need to have any Theme Team at all and then you pay for the Robot ATA for any figure that has the Robot Keyword. You MUST pay for the ATA on any character on your force that CAN use the ATA. If you have an Inhumans Named Theme Team and you want to use the Robot ATA you must pay for it on any character that has the Robot Keyword off the top of my head the chase Ultron and his drone. You cant pick and choose which characters use the ATA.Does that help at all?,Heroclix,d30ztw1,3,t5_2sec4

Your suggestion is nothing more than than Git Gud.  That attitude becomes toxic very quickly and causes the death of stores.  Heroclix is a dying game in my area due to that toxicity.

9598861,0,t1_d9w68gp,My experience with WF was greatly different.  I actually pulled a Toymaster as on rare but lucked out with Mary Marvel as the other.  I took second filling up  points with Tin Iron and some other support.  The guy that pulled KC Batman took like th.  WF had strong figures in all rarities.  The SF Batman and Supermans were consistently played.  Mr. Nobody was always played along with The Wizard.  Booster Gold was on every team that pulled him.  Negative Man Crazy Jane Alura Major Force and Creeper were all solid.  Thats not even counting the Metalmen too.Now if you got two boosters of Toymaster Condiment King Doc Magnus or The Chief you were screwed.  But thats part of sealed.  And only  figures that were completely unplayable in the upper rarity slots.  Maybe youd get a Black Cat or WitchWarlock thats  figs worth less than rd of your team most likely.The JW set especially in the CU slots there is more junk.  There is also more junk in the R slots and SR slots.  Primes seem pretty good overall.  Chases are absolute garbage.  I am not a fan of the one trick ponies.  A SR Green Lantern with no move and attack and no printed powers except ESD?  Even at  points thats completely lame.  In fact this set might be decent if all of the JSA were removed.  In fact after typing this all out I think thats my main dislike with it this JSA theme.

10414008,0,t3_5p2u5d,Mr. Freeze and the rest of his Arkham Asylum friends thought it would be cool to break into the Gotham City vault to steal some diamonds. I dont care what else you steal for yourselves but bring me the ice. Mr. Freeze said with a frosty attitude.TwoFace flipped a coin to determine which of the safety deposit boxes he would open first and The Joker was laughing over some choice ice puns in the corner with Harley Quinn and seven hired henchmen.Mista J ya think they have any puddin pops in here? Harley said in a super sweet voice as she sucked on a lollipop.HeeHeeHeeHoHooHum The Joker said.Exactly! She beamed kissing him on his cheek.TwoFace got heads on his coin flip and when no one was looking turned it to tails. Oh drats tails. Guess I better open this wicked looking box with the cool glowing runes all over it. He said turning towards a box inlaid with gold and positively thrumming with power. He unhitched the lid and opened it only to find a small pile of dorky looking hammers. Just then a massive explosion rocked the vault and a hole appeared from above. Odin and his amazing Asgardian host descended slowly to some rocking music and dancing lights. A fog machine kicked in from somewhere flowing tendrils dancing around their impressive legs.By mine magnificent beard why dost thou disturb mine box which was deposited safely? Odin said his hair billowing in the wind.Chill out. Mr. Freeze said directing an icy blast towards Odin.Odin didnt even bother to block allowing the beam to wash over him. Mr. Freeze was surprised for a moment then recovered enough to quip Scared of my might and too frozen in fear to act? He said his voice cracking for a moment.Foolish mortal! One of the Valkyries flanking Odin said. We come from the land of the ice and snow from the midnight sun where the hot springs flow!AhAh Ah! Said the Trolls around her in unison.Mine beard giveth mine followers all the strength of a thousand suns! Odin exclaimed as he chose telekinesis for his OP giveeveryonepowers ability. A troll flung him over to his deposit box. He turned to Splitlip who nodded.Are you ready to ing rock? Splitlip said punching the ground with his fist.AhAh Ah! The trolls said.Odin reached into the box and pulled out a hammer then swung it a few times grunted and then duct taped it to his sword Dead Rising style. He turned to face the convicts.Taste mine lightning ampers Odin roared as he charged in on his eight legged steed.The fight was brutal and pointless. Hammers and running shots were everywhere and the escaped convicts could have been fighting a hurricane for all the damage they were inflicting on the Asgard crew. After a few more moments it was all over. The scattered bodies of the inmates lay strewn about the floor amidst the rubble of the collapsed vault.Odin laughed kicking one of the henchmen out of his way as he rose into the air and flew back to Valhalla his entourage gliding behind him.A faint AhAh Ah was heard in the distance before fading.Cool party Mr. Freeze said before he collapsed from extreme blood loss and heat stroke.,Heroclix,dcohuqz,4,t5_2sec4

Theres a chance that will change but to assume something so base to how the game plays would change would be a bit far.For now I would keep governing these changes along with the things that havent changed until we know otherwise. Based on that and everything weve seen youll still get a hindered line of fire which helps Stealth and grants  defense from ranged attacks. They do even mention how light smaller objects are harder to hide behind which leads me to believe that hindering will still be in play for making it harder to hit from range and the entire mechanic of Stealth which is hiding from your opponent.,Heroclix,deynsus,1,t5_2sec4
