5536346,0,t3_3qy0zx,A knew some older IM songs like psycho and bustamove but never really got into those but the weirdness in the song Converting Vegetarians reminded me of early Serj Tankian and Ive always been a huge System of a Down fan. So I started listening to CV discovering songs for myself and having a favourite song every three days you know what Im talking about! Now I love ALL their work especially Vicious Delicious and LotbS. I also was very pleasantly suprised by CV.,InfectedMushroom,cwjbf59,1,t5_2sh30

11299394,0,t3_614nu3,Im not finding the trip to be expensive at all.  We usually go to EDCLV and this event is already  less. HOMmega is free for international travelers your passport is your ticket. Air bnb and meals are super cheap.  The most expensive thing about our trip will be the plane tickets...so far anyway  I imagine one we get down there well splurge on a tequila tasting trip. ,InfectedMushroom,dfcrplj,1,t5_2sh30
