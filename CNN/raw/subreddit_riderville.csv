2373092,0,t1_cm4jtcf,Sunseri came into a bad situation.  He needed a lot more game time prior to DD being out for half a season to be able to give the Riders a fighting chance at any success.  If no KJ than Sunseri would have died on a fire in september  and in  fans would criticize Taman for digging through other teams discarded QBs as in those with CFL experience to compete with Price for  who also has no experience.The end result sucked but Taman made the right call.  Name me one QB available Feb  that would have been a better option than the guy youve been developing yourself?   If you want to blame Taman for Sunseri then that error came when they signed Sunseri in .,riderville,cm50sy7,2,t5_2rwpr
