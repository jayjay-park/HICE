2056402,0,t3_2idjvi,Some feel that Brandon who has a strong business background as CEO of Dominos is not a good fit to the Michigan legacy. Many of his decisions such as to raise ticket prices despite a really weak  home schedule and mess with student seating policies at football and basketball games are seen as more about making money than winning games which degrades the Michigan reputation of excellence. In his defense this money has helped upgrade many of the athletic facilities across many sports. Brandon calls his relationship with students outstanding but students feel otherwise and his failure to acknowledge their feelings only makes them hate him more. Needless to say the handling of the Shane Morris situation a recent promo offering free tickets for buying two Cokes and the teams depressing record only further angered fans students and alumni and has really brought out the pitchforks.  The fact that Hoke is crapping the bed this season and Brandon refuses to fire him immediately is icing on that cake. ,MichiganWolverines,cl17pk6,6,t5_2s3vu

And even if we do win out over undefeated OSU and Iowa to win the conference championship a playoff spot is still a stretch because we have  losses.My point is that  losses doesnt automatically mean our playoff chances are  as theres a decent chance that most of the teams ranked above us will lose another game and we still have the chance to impress the playoff committee and win the BG championship.,MichiganWolverines,cwwltkm,1,t5_2s3vu

So Im not that worried that so many ers left  thats not uncommon.Secondly I sort of question your honesty about how closely youve followed the situation. You saygt These decommittments arent typical because the talent of the players Michigan is losing isnt typical. Antwuan Johnson Leonard Taylor Jalil Irvin and Aubrey Solomon were all great gets for Michigan and the  class was shaping up to be an excellent one.A few red flags Solomon is the class of  not . Same goes for Otis Reese. Secondly you talk about how the class of  was shaping up to be an excellent one  it doesnt even have enough recruits for a full team!
