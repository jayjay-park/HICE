1854418,0,t3_2b0bz2,is it possible? i mean anything is possible with enough know how determination and luck. but your lack of EE experience is going to get you nowhere on this. more than likely you would have to discard the entire upper clamshell assembly for a new screen to fit work out the pinouts and make a convertercable for them. the wifi antena should be able to be separated from the lcd so thats not much of a worry.dont let any of that stop you though expect to break a few of these before you make any progress. ,ZipitZ2,ckcni69,1,t5_2zuse
