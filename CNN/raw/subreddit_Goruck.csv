2179338,0,t3_2k0tay,I run the L at Lights from time to time and they work ok. Youll be a little snug with bricks as opposed to leadplatessome other more dense weight. A L is probably far too small. Getting Challenge weight and gear into a Bullet would be really tricky.The biggest reason I would try to talk you out of a Bullet for your first event especially a Challenge is that they are soft packs with no frame sheet or other structural rigidity. The straps will take the full load of your pack and on a Bullet those straps as a little narrower than most bigger guys will be comfortable with.Can you do it? Absolutely. Should you? Probably not it wont be the most comfortable introduction to the sport.Whenwhere is your event?,Goruck,clguhs6,2,t5_2w0zr

8556612,0,t3_4wxzia, as well and Ive owned the  gr and the  gr. For weekend trips the gr should take care of you. That will depend on if youre a heavy packer what you will be taking aside from clothestoiletries and if you are travelling in the winter coat boots etc. Personally I usually pack an extra outfit just in case I get caught in weather spill coffee etc. yet still have enough room in my bag for my computer and accessories.I liked the gr but used it abroad for  weeks along with a big roller. The extra organization was useful but not necessary. I also carried a lot of shit on me that I wouldnt normally carry. It is still a good option for weekend use if you do carry a lot of stuff with you or just like to be prepared. I will say that it felt a bit big on me and Im . It wasnt massive or anything I guess I just like something more sleek.  ,Goruck,d6b5h9p,2,t5_2w0zr

9214461,0,t3_5629po,I am also in Ontario. I ordered my GR L a couple of weeks ago. I received it  days later. Free shipping because orders over  USD ship free to Canada and I knowing this tacked on a  sternum strap that I may never use to get me to  total. Saved me almost . That being said I am pretty sure it was driven here when it shouldve been flown. And until it got into Canadian Post tracking updates were pretty sketchy.,Goruck,d8k025y,2,t5_2w0zr

9534308,0,t1_d9m43wv,Thanks. As for the rumor the attachment on GR etc is not losing the webbing. So no they wont all be like the Rucker.,Goruck,d9oawod,1,t5_2w0zr
9544175,0,t3_5bj5pm,Ive experienced this several times and as mentioned elsewhere its most likely thoracic outlet syndrome. It seems to be a combination of the weight of the ruck and of internal swellinginflammation of the muscles especially the pectoralis minor. The inflammation may be in part caused by other exercises but only causes problems when combined with the compression of the ruck strap. For me two things helped tremendously Dropping ruck weight and gradually building up. I started at  lbs dry weight and am now at  lbs dry weight most of the time. But got there over many months of slow gradual increases.  Aggressive antiinflammatoryprohealing approaches to the thoracic outlet area including icing heating stretching and a lot of work with mobility balls. ,Goruck,d9pimhx,2,t5_2w0zr

11204305,0,t3_5zxs3x,It seems like the new versions of all of their rucks are doublingdown on ruck plate integration and rucking in general. With that being said I own both versions and find that they both work well as day packs. However I feel the v is much more versatile as a day pack when I do not pack a ruck plate. In contrast v is better with a ruck plate. If I were using it for an event definitely the v...but you asked specifically as a daypack so I would recommend v.Both pack fine in a L GR.,Goruck,df1zs7x,3,t5_2w0zr

11730855,0,t3_5y85mt,Im a bit late on this but the Active Shooter class might sound a bit more advanced but is actually suitable for beginners whereas the Advanced course is not.  With your level of experience you should take Active Shooter first.I just did Active Shooter this weekend and was very new to firearms.  Barely knew what a slide lock was kind of new.  Had a great time and never felt unsafe.  As long as you can listen to directions you will be fine.,Goruck,dgpq18p,2,t5_2w0zr
11765237,0,t1_dgtlqq1,I was in  not Beta so I cant speak to differences between those two. Most event series they run tend to evolve over time though.  felt like a fully formed event with only minor hiccups.They cover a ton of information in the  hours and you are always drinking from the firehose. I did the  Expedition Heavy and we were treated the same way  the biggest difference is that Constellation is half the time so we didnt get as much time to executeconfirm that you actually learned correctly.I think they could cut  out of the curriculum reduce the number of times you went to the field for exercises some of the drills can easily be done at the start pointhome base and give a little more time for practical execution. Some of the movements felt superfluous and ate up time that we could have used elsewhere.Our CULEX final exercise was a hoot but with  total teams and only  participating at any given point there was a lot of standing around waiting. I think  tasks where half the group does each then switches would be a great format to try out.,Goruck,dgtmbel,6,t5_2w0zr
