4266086,0,t1_cs6hwlk,I assumed that the dodgy salesman had effectively got a bunch of synths that had fallen off the back of a lorry  Anita being one of them. Clearly theres some sort of blackmarket what with that chopshop guy Colin MorganLeo questioned.,HumansTV,cs6i892,17,t5_340zj
4282669,0,t1_cs8ciub,Would pain stop you from being injured? Or would it tell you to be more careful next time? Would a robot need to be reminded with their perfect clarity of history?And emotionally which is how I was interpreting the question Id have thought is an energy sink for no real gain unless the objective is to be more human but Im not clear what the motivation for that would actually be.Unless they were programmed intentionally or otherwise to attempt to emulate human life as closely as possible.,HumansTV,cs8djpn,1,t5_340zj

4411609,0,t1_csm3wil,gt who the fuck is Tom?I hope the show doesnt go the obvious route with that Tom being Lauras lover and actually has something more interesting up its sleeve for what Laura is hiding.,HumansTV,csmx8kx,5,t5_340zj

4591954,0,t3_3dwoj3,The trigger was Laura talking about her dead brother Tom. Mia remembered Leos drowning incident when Laura was talking about Toms incident. That caused her to temporarily regain access of her body. Later on in the episode Mattie figures out that Mia translated her root directory into pure sensory data in order to prevent getting deleted. Since she exists as sensory data Id imagine she could see hear and feel everything Anita was doing hence why she always seems to surface whenever Sophie is involved she remembers Leo in Sophie as well as in Tom. ,HumansTV,ct9es1j,21,t5_340zj

4667821,0,t3_3evwco,When the family find out that MiaAnita is  years old they are shocked as even current Sims are generally only  years or less old. Its a matter of degradation as well as innovation. They are essentially built with an expiration date so people need to get the newest model with newest features. I assume part of that is to keep people mindful that they are appliances and not family members.,HumansTV,ctixky5,3,t5_340zj
4718861,0,t1_ctp9yoc,That was a great line.  What had me wondering was Lauras enigmatic expression after she hid the hard drive in the linens.  It seemed synthlikeAlso I dont get the flow of Laura just taking the hard drive from the daughters bag and not telling anyone.  Its a pretty crucial item and the whole family knows it exists.    ???,HumansTV,ctpcnfr,7,t5_340zj

9637551,0,t1_da10vum,But Mia probably wasnt created with factory settings in her brain since shes not just a standard synth which has been modded but was created by Elster.When she was captured they probably tried to wipe her existing programs cos they thought shed been modded and wanted to sell her as a legit synth and had the latest standard software installed which was the Anita personality.So I see them as separate programs.,HumansTV,da10z8k,1,t5_340zj
