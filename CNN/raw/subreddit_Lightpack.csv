621027,0,t3_215czv,The Lightpack support already responded to my ticket this morning and sent me the full CE test report which covers both the actual device and the power supply.The manual is only available in English. If this really is a problem we could start a github repo with translated manuals ,Lightpack,cgav0sx,1,t5_2xevq
661071,0,t3_1y94qw,Its a bummer that windowed mode does not support SLI or Crossfire so not only am I receiving a processing hit from these running Im also receiving a hit from losing one of my video cards making these absolutely useless. I dont watch videos on my monitor they are attached to. I guess thats what you get when you support a Kickstarter without having a full idea of what youre getting. Has anyone used these with a USB extension? Wondering if I could hook it up to my  in the living room instead so I at least get a use while watching movies.,Lightpack,cgfew73,1,t5_2xevq

1887463,0,t3_2g730x,its not just you. i have a lightbox on an imac and on the same machine i get good fps on mac but running windows . i get very low fps. i also have  lightboxes on another monitor on my pc with windows . i  core x cpu  GB ram and SLI Titan Blacks and with screen capturing on I only get like  fps and moving windows around and everything is slowed making it not usable.issue with low fps seems to be with the prismatik software and how it does capturing in windows .. with a single lighbox people have reported ambibox runs fine however ambibox doesnt support  lightpacks so using ambibox is not a solution for those of us using  lightpacks.until software is updated and it fixes the issue you may want to try using Lightpack Filter for Media Player Classic or SVPlight as part of SmoothVideo Project to watch videos. im using it with my two lightpacks and works fine. For SVPLight you would need svp manager software which works with only certain videoplayers. the software makes videos play at fps using frame interpolation but you should be able to disable this if you dont want this and only want to use it for svplight so you can watch videos with your lighpacks.on the lightpack facebook page they did recently wrote they are possibly looking to do an update in September so hopefully there is a software update that fixes the issue with prismatik.,Lightpack,ckgmqff,1,t5_2xevq
2759072,0,t1_cnhomdl,I agree! Thats how I would have my setup.  Yes in theory it should work  I just dont want to dump  bucks on the HD to SCART without knowing.   ,Lightpack,cnhp1za,1,t5_2xevq
2908246,0,t3_2tfcqp,In Prismatik I think it would be as simple as making another profile for D movies. It would depend on what type of D movies you have but most are SBS side by side so you would just make a profile that is scaled to one half of the screen. Since your TV would be the one merging the output into D the PC would still see the screen split as it is from the source.,Lightpack,cnyoav0,1,t5_2xevq
3807637,0,t1_cqm0uoh,This blogpost of yours is a goldmine! Thank you!Just to recap and make sure that this solution is anything I can go ahead with I have a Onkyo receiver that can output the same video input on two HDMI output. I will connect one of them as now to the TV and the other to a HDMIAV converter. From the converter to the USB capture card. And then to the RPi. The raspberry will run OSMC and Hyperion to control LEDs x Lightpack  LED strips.Questions Raspberry can stay on all the time? Should be able to since when there is no picture out from the receiver there is nothing to capture and no LEDs should light up. I will now have backlight from all my sources because everything is going through the receiver? I can turn Aero on again on my Win mediacenter so there will be no tearing in videos?  I have a RPi  revB Mhz x USB. Is this capable to do this? And does the necessary US hub need to be external powered? If I have a switch on the RPi will it boot automatically and start Hyperion without user interference?,Lightpack,cqqauc2,1,t5_2xevq

6122772,0,t1_cylfi0y,Windows  i actually bought a lightpack after seeing someone on battlesttions show off an animation display on the screen similar to ElectricSheep. The noticeable thing was the leds responding to changing background but after using both prismatik and ambibox i have not figured out how to do this,Lightpack,cyllg3o,1,t5_2xevq
