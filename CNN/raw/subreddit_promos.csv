I was sick of it a year ago and there is no end in sight for this shameful mass influx of worthless vape pen companies.Why arent people vaping yet? Cause there is disinformation about the necessary apparatus jammed down their throats from every which direction with jerkoff companies like this one trying to rip them off for subpar garbage products that are exactly the same as every other company selling this rebranded markedup garbage.Anyone wanna try a vape pen?  Fuck paying  for their crap.FOR THE CURRENTLY UNINFORMEDFirst and foremost these pens are meant for vaping THC concentrates.  Shatter budder and crumble work best but any concentrate that is dabbed can be used in one of these devices.  There are also cheap atomizers that will use flower but they dont actually vaporize.  They quite obviously burn the herbs.  I dont recommend them but some people only have access to flower so this is your only availability in this realm.  If you want a portable handheld vaporizer that actually vaporizes flower properly then youre gonna have to pony up for something in the field of Pax or its competitors and these vape pens will be of no good to you.SO IF THATS NOT AN ISSUE!Heres all you need!  To buy an atomizer and a battery and battery chargerBulb Style Electronic Cigarettes Round Mouth Atomizer  .Electronic Cigarette USB Charging Cable  .And then any of the dozens of variety of batteries in all shapes sizes colors and decor  They start at  and scale upwards depending on vendor but dont be fooled these all do the exact same thing but Im linking to search results to all batteries  and under so you can decide which battery you want... for a whole setup including free worldwide shipping.

That only pays out a million?  Seems like a high risk low reward.  I wonder what the odds are.  Did you hear about that female statistics professor in Texas who has won a couple of million dollars playing scratchers?  I wonder what her secret is.  I guess the games arent actually random.I always thought of lotteries as a tax on people who are bad at math.  But in our society saving  a week a yearreally doesnt add up to much in the end.   years later with  interest it only adds up to around not a life changing amount. Right now that will get you a pretty nice car.  In thirty years?  Lotteries were better when they were organized in the neighborhoods.  You win  to  you can buy a car you can buy a sofa set you can redo your kitchen you can start a business. The money stays in the neighborhood.  You win ?  You move out.Saying that the proceeds go to fund education really isnt accurate.  Yes all money from the lottery goes to education or whatever but it isnt additional moneyit replaces other sources of funding.  I guess if the school system got small enough and the lottery got big enough to completely fund it having the money go to education would be beneficial.

744439,0,t3_227hm0,During my senior of high school in our old home I woke up late at night. It was around  in the morning. To my surprise I saw a large ghostly apparition of what seemed to me like the head of a goblin mixed with Satan from Dantes Inferno. This demonic creature was just staring at me with this menacing smile. He had small horns on his head and goblin fangs and a goatee that was sharp as a razor extending below his chin. He also had round ghoulish eyes. The entire head of this apparition seemed semitransparent and I thought I was just hallucinating or something. I live in Florida so it was a pretty warm night. So I rubbed my eyes to see if this fiend would go away but to my surprise it was still there three feet in front of my bed. For some reason I wasnt frightened. I glared right into this fiends grotesque eyes and it appeared to me that it noticed my aggression towards it. The fiends facial expression then changed from his twisted smile to an hideous frown. It seemed to me that he was in awe with the fact that I was merely challenging his presence. As he frowned the fiend slowly started drifting horizontally across my room my eyes followed him as this enlarged head just vanished by moving across my room and through the walls. By then my heart was beating like a jolting locomotive. It was uncontrollable. I did not know what to expect next. So I leaped off my bed for some odd reason I did not turn the lights on guess it was because it was in the heat of the moment and made my way to the living room. Our house was dark the small night lights were plugged and my parents were asleep so I did not want to go about turning on every single electrical unit in the house. To my surprise there was nothing there. No trace of the fiend himself in our home. It was quiet and even though my blood was warm. I knew that this demonic entity had lost at least that night. I told my parents and my friends about this incident the next day they all freaked out. My parents being religious as they are told me to have more faith and pray often. My friends on the other hand shrieked just upon hearing this story. They did not want to spend the night at my house as much at least not sleep in my room after that incident. That house was always tainted with problems after my encounter. There were water leakage from the pipes and through the walls. There was an increase in cockroach infestation and even fire ants had managed to get inside the house. Our landlord made no attempt to fix any of these problems. I even developed allergies from staying in that place that my doctor had to prescribe me an allergic inhaler to help remediate my symptoms. To this day I have not seen this fiend ever since that night. My family moved out of that house three years later while I was in college. Its been four years since my encounter with the entity and I guess it means that I have won. Or who knows? Only time will tell when it makes an attempt to come back and try to haunt me once more. But all I will say to the hideous creature is that you may try and you will fail.,promos,cgowdhx,1,t5_2r4w1

I was excited to see how they reacted! Well they wanted to split some brownies between them but one girl accidently ate a lot more than she should have by accident when she found out she got upset and sort of just passed out so my friends girlfriend stayed with her but leant us some bud to hotbox with.We go on the hotbox us two dudes in the front three girls in the back. They were asking us how exactly to smoke and stuff like that.

Im not doubting you that that is the case but I have experienced pretty rapid responses and assistance from their support staff.Moolah is a new company. They are trying to do their best right now but because they are so new there are bound to be some bugs and bumps in the road. I know this past week they were dealing with some very unexpected problems that were beyond their control so that may have something to do with their lack of responsiveness. I encourage you to be persistent in trying to contact their support and get your questions answered. They mean well and will get back to you. You could also post in rMoolah.

892576,0,t1_ch59y4c,Small companies including startups often have trouble with liquidity.  One way of managing that is to offer subscriptions to guarantee a regular income.  It does not necessarily indicate a scam.Or do you think that periodicals are scams too?  Why dont Private Eye or The Economist allow you to order a single issue? after all if the magazine was any good people would keep coming back for more because they liked it!In this case Pact is not just selling coffee theyre selling the convenience of having probably highquality coffee delivered to your doorstep on a regular basis.  In the st century it is easier than ever to cancel regular subscriptions if they are no longer wanted.I suggest that rather than trying to bully whoevers behind the reddit account into changing their companys business model you accept that you dont want coffee on a subscription.  Thats perfectly fine and theres no shortage of online highqualitycoffee suppliers eg Drury offering the conventional orderdeliver model.  But this companys decision to try a different route says nothing about its coffee quality.

973016,0,t1_chdx5mx,Creator of CheapShark here. Would like to respond to a couple points you have brought up.gtCheapshark is one that made it through recently too. Theyre a site that aggregates deals just like rGameDeals  except they add affiliate codes to the links to generate revenue.Yes I do use affiliate links on the site. However keep in mind that I created the site and have put thousands of hours into coding and developing it. How is monetizing my own site with ads affiliate links any different than reddit monetizing with advertisements? If web developers never got paid for their efforts there wouldnt be anywhere near as much drive to create the websites you can use for free today whether that be reddit or CheapShark Google or Twitter you name it. If people on rgamedeals dont like the site they wont click any of the links on it wont generate me any revenue and will show me that they are not interested in my advertising here. So far I havent found that to be the case though. The only pushback Ive seemed to have is from the mods here rather than the community itself.gtCheapshark sometimes farms sales info off of rGameDeals or other game tracking sites but sometimes not. They provide the same general content except by inserting affiliate codes into the links.This is  false. CheapShark gets all pricing info directly from stores. We dont get info from rgamedeals or any other tracking sites. Also we list every price from all  stores we list not just sales. There would be no advantage to skimming prices from rgamedeals as we get the prices directly from the source stores.Also I think rgamedeals and CheapShark may both list game deals but they go about it in totally different ways. I think they work great together not sure why others view them as direct competition. CheapShark rates deals automatically and allows you to easily filter them it is for catching some deals that may fall between the cracks or setting up price alerts. On the other hand rgamedeals is the best way to see what other gamers think are the best deals of the day and covers more niche bundles or smaller stores.So in closing I can understand why you might view the site as competition but in my opinion I think that both rgamedeals and CheapShark work great together.,promos,chew3a9,8,t5_2r4w1

1168487,0,t1_ci0vkke,Endgame implies that its the end which it is not carbine even calls it elder game rather than endgame which fits. I see the leveling progress not as the game but as the tutorial. Granted its a very long tutorial but it will teach you everything rather than just the basics. Any actual tutorial will simply tell you go to X do Y and get result Z while the leveling progress is simply go fuck yourself figure it out.At the end of it youve gotten enough experience and knowledge about the game to play the ctual game. LoL is a good example getting max level doesnt mean jack. At lvl you probably havent learned a tenth of what there is to know.In Wildstar you get abilities and slots in bitesized chunks that i feel are appropriate. For instance i just opened up my last LAS slot and ive only just started to feel like i could usewant another skill on there. And there is still stuff i have barely touched runes for instance or just glossed over a bit AMPS. There is so much to learn and experience being able to hit max lvl in  hours doesnt mean that there isnt any content.Because of the amount you learn this way its impossible to start doing raids and fucking it up for everyone else. Youve had to do a lot of things and a bunch of pretty tough things before you can even touch raiding. That way you know what the basics of what to do just like in LoL before hitting the hardest part of the game.End game is the wrong name its elder game.,promos,ci12pkd,1,t5_2r4w1

I lived in Tottenham at the time of the riots after Mark Duggan was shot just after that riot there were armed police special circumstances for firearm carrying is determined by the police force itself.Their are two things you can legally do with a gun in the UK shoot for sport whether hunting or clay shooting and pest control.However cases like Andy Ferrie and Tony Martin are less to do with gun laws and more to do with the UKs vague definition of Self Defencewhich states the perpetrator doesnt have to consider legal ramifications of the actions he takes to defend himself.When Tony Martin Shot that guy in the back as he was running away. it caused that much media buzz because nobody was sure whether they could actually convict him of the two crimes he had commited or whether self defence covered both of them. He did eventually get charged because he didnt have a license for the gun which is telling. Had he a lisence for it he may very well have got away with it because under our self defence laws your allowed to commit crimes to save your life.We dont discuss our gun laws as much as the Americans but its worth reading up on for example the only legal pistols in the UK are obsolete calibres or antiques so if we wanted to we could all own Flintlocks.,promos,cj1bqbp,3,t5_2r4w1

1528140,0,t3_2bd5q1,My family didnt celebrate Christmas so when my best friend found out he started inviting me over on Christmas Eve to exchange gifts. Many many years later he had become an uncle we were both older etc I was struggling for what to get him that year.  We had a budget but an expensive gift just wasnt going to cut it.So while shopping around I took a break and wandered into a comic book store.  And sitting there was a th printing of the stories leading up to the Death of Superman.Now a th printing isnt worth much but this was the Christmas after his death.  He and I used to read comics as kids but we really didnt have time to follow them anymore.  Anyways I get the comic add it to his gift stack and etc etc.Now on Christmas Eve we open the presents and as he gets to his little gifts he opens the comic and man it was like the sun coming out. He has this Shiite eating grin on his face and he tells me hes looking forward to reading at the end of the night.That should have been the end of it but his nephews all come over and start begging for a chance to borrow it when hes done because they all want to read the book.Now Im so happy and feeling great because not only does my buddy love it but his nephews think that its clearly the best gift this year.We go have dinner but then later as per tradition we are doing the dishes when not only his dad but his uncle come over and mention very quietly and discretely that when he has the time they wouldnt mind having a look at that book... just to see what all the hype is about.So there you go the best gift I ever gave anyone was my best buddy when he got a  comic that made him the envy of every male one Christmas.P.S. Of course I read it before I gave it to him p,promos,cj7tvbk,1,t5_2r4w1
1535636,0,t3_1vs1xr,Ive paid for the services of a professional therapist before for over  years. She didnt once tell me anything that I didnt already know. Not once. I only kept going for as long as I did to have someone to talk to. It became a comfort zone rut of which I grew weary. I thanked her for her time and quit knowing I helped her probably a little bit more than she helped me . I felt like the same person the last time I left her office as the first time I walked in  years earlier.Ive belonged to a support group for over  years unrelated to sexual addiction. The main benefit is that you get real world insight from a diverse range of people from different backgrounds who all share in a unique and specific problem. We speak honestly with each other without robotic canned phrases and superficial smarmy overpoliteness. Sometimes we tell each other to fuck off. Sometimes we tell each other how much we love them. Sometimes we form actual real facetoface friendships. No money is exchanged. Not a dime. Thats how you know what youre getting is REAL.I appreciate NoFap may need ad  for overhead. I appreciate that some NoFappers may need extra guidance in the beginning of their own person extreme makeover. I appreciate the caution wariness and hostility expressed toward these profiteers. I appreciate that we all need money to buy us things and that if we have something that someone else wants it is not necessarily wrong to charge for it. I appreciate that some of us knew that we were making our own personal lives a living hell and did little or nothing to stop it until it got bad really bad and now want help cleaning up the mess. What I dont appreciate is the extreme air of phony sincerity and being in denial about it as if we were all incredibly incredibly incredibly stupid. Im talking to you Neulia Marketing Asshole. You need to work on your schtick. Youre one of the worst Ive seen. Honestly you suck at this. Some advice when you repeatedly use the same scripted words and phrases when you backtalk to your troubled prospects when you sidestep questions when you appear so defensive and so on you raise all kinds of red flags about the expertise authenticity and motives of the company you represent. Youll do better if you appear a little less obviously evil.   I would normally feel wrong giving you any advice at all as it would be aiding the enemy but I must because you are just so pathetic. Its like youre jumping into a knife fight with a blunt spoon. Maybe you need to pay for an online course in marketing before you actually engage in marketing?Anybody that gives money to Neulia must be naive andor incredibly incredibly incredibly desperate for a shortcut. No judgement. Ive been both naive and incredibly incredibly incredibly desperate before. If you are desperate and you genuinely feel that you have no better options please give them a try. If it truly saves your life it will be the best money you ever spent even if the legendary George Collins andor his band of experts laugh at you behind your back as they head to the bank. Just remember anything and probably everything that they tell you is to be found for free not only on the internet or in a library book in the heart and soul of another flesh and blood human being or buried inside of plain old you you just have to stop making excuses be humble and open yourself to it.

Their business is well their business. If they want to prioritize video traffic over say smtp traffic then that is their right. If you dont like how a business does business then you can contract with a different ISP.  I dont like the idea either. However as the grownups will tell you what you like and what is right are not always the same thing. Your neighbor girl analogy doesnt work because the ISP has a pipe going into your house and the pipe belongs to them. ,promos,ckfkcvd,-1,t5_2r4w1

1971544,0,t1_ckqpqfv,Im a Redditor myself. Reddit is actually the only advertising channel where the audience actively post comments and ask questions. Everywhere elseGoogle Adwords Facebook Twitter display adsthere is either no customer feedback at all or minimal comments. If you read through this thread youll see that I answer basically every question with the best knowledge I have. Most advertisers dont do that. Even for meat there are production minimums that prevent us from sending one serving. Our turkey supplier for example has a minimum one pound threshold for individually sealed bags of turkey. We actually got comments from our customers that sending a whole pound of turkey for a turkey burger was excessive and they felt that we should have sent less. However our meat provider would refuse to individually seal the turkey package for less than a pound. You are welcome to believe that we are another evil company out to rip people off. My response has been and always will be we are a subscription based company. We only make money when we have happy customers who stick around. We lose money on every single first order with the current promo. So if customers try us once and find that we send lowquality food and recipes they will simply not order again. The fact that we have many customers who have ordered every week for more than a year our company is just a bit more than a year old speaks volumes of what they think of our service. The fact that we run such a generous promotion is that we believe our service is awesome enough that people will stick around.,promos,ckqrsc0,13,t5_2r4w1

2017527,0,t1_ckvvzz5,gt Reddit is not a superior news aggregator its a pretty terrible one overall with regards to this kind of news.Reddit is as good at aggregating as you want it to be for example I am subscribed to multiple subreddit that focus on local news to my school city county  State and Country. The news articles posted to these subreddits are voted on by people who also care about the quality of news being posted here more on the smaller reddits than places like rnews. Not only are articles from Yahoo and other similar and narrow news sites posted to these reddits they are ranked by their users and commented on by a community that I can only assume are far more active than those on yahoo. This does not objectively make reddit better but in my subjective opinion a site where the content is at the will of the users is much better than news being fed to you by a company who is owned by its stockholders.gt The signal to noise here is ridiculously badNow this comes down to your personal and customized reddit account I personally find little noise in my feed assuming by noise you mean things that are irrelevant or counter to what should be appearing. Maybe you should try trimming down the subreddits you are subbed to or looking for smaller more curated reddits.gt the circlejerk bias and tyrannical mod censorship is so overwhelmingly powerful that youre guaranteed to get highly biased extremely selective idea of news that skips an enormous number of stories.First see above. Second I guarantee the bias you see on reddit and other user driven news sites is going to be a fraction of what you recieve taking your news stories from main stream media for example Yahoo is a quite liberal news sitegt Reddit is a better way to lose  hours of your day inundated with about a  posts and conversations though.Again while this may be true in your case im sure there are plenty of people who can lose  hours a day doing of plenty of things such as browsing yahoos news section or rolling around on the floor. I personally use reddit for about  hours a day if I have nothing better do or im at work. I hope you dont take any of this personal because reading back though my comment makes it seem mean and that wasnt the intention at all. Im positive you are a great person both smart and charming.

Were aware China has pretty much cornered the solar market. What weve missed is they are also highly subsidizing desalinization technology. They have a great need but I suspect they are also looking for Africa to become their next source for coolie labor as their own population advances.

3098523,0,t1_coj33jj,I did not say it was MLM mate. I said it was akin to MLM. You know what I am talking about so please spare it... If you are only just creating a blog than what are you doing making yourself out to be some sort of expert on blogs when you are not? Thats like me learning to swim and saying im going to teach people how to swim... its stupid and its immoral.Youre using the oldest and laziest trick in the Internet snake oil salesman book and are building yourself up to be an expert when in fact you and I and anyone else with half a brain knows that you are not.And please spare me your I work in marketing garbage. I work in manufacturing by day does that make me an expert? Fuck no it doesnt. Mate Ive developed websites several good ones in fact I have sold those sites Ive written blogs Ive written content online for other websites and clients Ive created built up and sold social traffic hubs and you will never catch me attempting to teach people how to do these types of things because I AM NOT AN EXPERT and I am not willing to morally bankrupt myself all in the name money.If you wanted to help people you would give them the information for free on your blog. But you dont you want to make money and to do it you will fake your ass to the top. I run into people like you all of the time and the Internet is filled with newbie goofs like you who make an absolute mockery of yourselves at the expense of people who are being led astray.I watched your stupid videos and signed up to your list and maaaan you need to learn a lot! Its actually embarrassing watching and listening to you talk crap all in the name of making a few dollars.Firstly you use a single optin my guess is you are desperate for new subscribers and then your claims about how many students you have are quickly dwindled when I see how many views the video lessons have actually had which is pretty bad than finally the advice you give in the lessons is literally verging on illegal you are basically telling people to risk their forum accounts and spam the forum users. In fact in your video titled Part  Finding where your customers hang out you say and I quote I can invite him to whatever I want to I can ask him any type of question that I want to and most of the time these people will respond because youre being pretty genuine its not viewed as like your spamming them or anything...Uhhh no. You are  full of shit once again. You are in FACT literally spelling out the definition of spamming right there Travis and all it takes is for one or two people to complain about your little invitations and your forum account could be blocked or worse your IP added to a spam list.And to make it worse you then show people how to spam users on Reddit by going into detail about how they can build Karma in a single day and I quote just to show you are active on the site... By making a few comments so that they can then message SPAM literally all of the people in a subreddits thread and again ill quote you theres  people in that one thread if you really wanted to you could run down that whole thing and email I mean message all of them right to their inbox.I really CBF tearing your shit up anymore. My advice walk away with your tail between your legs have a good long hard think about what you are doing come back to it with a fresh view and go from there.Never ever spam never ever assume people are stupid never ever be dishonest with people and never ever pretend to be someone your not because lets face it  you are NOT a successful entrepreneur in fact you dont even bring in money for your blog.Good luckOh and by the way you might want to add an unsub link to your emails wouldnt want anyone to mark them as spam and complain would you...? ,promos,coj5skn,0,t5_2r4w1
3114231,0,t3_2talkk,We have sold out of our inventory of w isticks and nautilus minis! Thanks again to everyone who ordered. Well be out of stock for a bit which is frustrating but its given us some time to rethink what we want to offer in light of some of the excellent products that have come to the market recently. For instance the price different between the w istick and the w istick is almost negligible while opening up quite a few more options for tanks. The Nautilus Mini will probably always be considered a great all around tank but it doesnt perform quite like the Sub Tank Nano which has become our new favorite. So while well probably always offer the classic w istick  Nautilus Mini combo as a base option we just got in a shipment of w isticks and are waiting on a shipment of Aspire Atlantiss Kangertech Sub Tank Nanos and their replacement coils. The sub tank and atlantis should be in stock next week and you can preorder now. The only uncertainty is how well be effected by the Chinese New Year which basically shuts everything down. Our shipment has made it to DHL though and we assume it will be one of the first businesses to get back to work. We assume that at the latest theyll be here in  days the rd. But this is all speculation.Due to the inconvenience of backordering we are offering this options at discounted prices so if you choose to place a backorder youll get a great deal. ,promos,coksfoe,2,t5_2r4w1

I went into a catatonic state. he continued to scream and lunge at us treating to kill us. everyone on the bus scattered. the driver stopped and they all piled out including us we were last though. we ran screaming down the street and into the nearest store which happened to be a smoke shop. fun night. ,promos,cpjzl82,-15,t5_2r4w1

Consumerconversion is even a problem on common commercial websites asking the user to perform tasks like account creation when one doesnt even had the possibility to see what for are a hassle and will push easily over the half of visitors away.In a genre like incremental games that is dominated by the spirit of diy and open source Id bet money that the number is more like .Its not that hard to make such guest access reminding the user politely after maybe  or  minutes whether he likes to make an account letting him transform his progress to a newly created acc and will make your website much more accessible friendly and last but not least frequented.Furthermore paytowin shop models are not only over a decade behind standards they are bad practice.Paywin is usually associated as a huge drawbacknegative by most wouldbecustomers just because of the state of gaming in general see Guildwars  League of Legends I could name three dozen more examples but the best is maybe the hate on the Diablo  RMAH. This will even while not even remotely important for a watchatnumbersgame like an incremental that is not really competitive drive people away or leave them at least in a bad moodbad opinion about your websitegame.Not even that but you will most likely not make much money at all since your players are not really driven by ego like the usual target audience for paywingames see any huge numbers asia mmos or World of Tanks THE most successful paywin on the market. Immaturity and a feeling of powerlesness will usually lead to a strong enough craving that these users will be motivated enough to be converted.That doesnt even remotely touch the usual suspects that idle in front of incremental games for hours does it?Stereotypes of gamers aside what you COULD try to sell are supportpackages in the style of kickstarter see for example Path of Exile or the incredible annoying early access wave on steam.People that like your game are moraly inclined to help you and will be willing to spent the value of a starbuckscoffee for something shiny after they had a week full of fun with your game.Golden Borders titles backgrounds whatever.. its more about the feeling of having done a good deed than goodies in this case.What would move the thoughtprocess in that direction would be an about tab where you introduce yourself with something like some random facts a picture and the size of your collegedebt.

Did you know you can get to your options screen from the topright navbar menu?gt I have experienced a bug whenever I click the back button on my phone after opening a picture. I use an android device... The screen turns grey and I cant interact with the page anymore I have to refresh to fix it.Oh sorry! Any chance I could ask you to file a bug report at  with your browser info? Will try take a look into it today!Hows the site feel on your phone otherwise? I mostly use it from my notebook but have been surprised to see how many folks appear to be running on mobiles.gt Aside from that I think making the app succeed is a matter of growing the userbase. The people I messaged seem friendly and the experience has been nice.Definitely encouraging to hear thanks for sharing that.gt Personally the hardest part to make the concept work is definitely to take the initiative and start a conversation but that is not an issue related to the software itself. Ill just have to work on being less shy eheh  thats the big challenge now. Mostly a case of setting up the right initial culture Im hoping  getting folks used to the idea that everyone theres friendly and hoping someone says hi. Ive found that as people get their first few messages they start to settle in  feel comfortable then they start writing others. So getting new users involved right away is definitely a big help.Have some tuning planned for the algo soon that I think may also be able to help with this.Thanks again for your inputthoughts really helps!,promos,culiv9m,1,t5_2r4w1

If someone cares about trigger warnings they will find an outlet for news or an aggregation site which respects that and uses them.

From huntergathering and later agricultural societies came rituals small things that people noticed would help them survive those lores would be incorporated into religion mystified. Look at KosherHalal practices or several Shinto practices they all contain rules about hygiene stop disease spreading preserve foods avoid conflict and so forth.Those things would shape early philosophy what are we what is expected of us what are the rules of a society and so forth. Religion started as an amazing thing probably one of the main factors were are as we are today funny enough it just got outdated nowadays and highly corrupted as civilizations started to develop outside of tribalsmall settings and began to explore and exploit the environment and people realized just how much power a wise man had as the very nature of power is nothing other than mass delusion and mutual agreement to do what someone says.

6052935,0,t3_3polc2,aromatherapy is something that I love my vaporizer for. I think that vaping the weed is a healthy option and have often wanted to vape other herbs therefore I decided about a year ago to try it. I use basil in my vape when i have a little of an upset stomach from gas. I use chamomile to relax myself after a particular stressful day of work this one is really enjoyable. Sometimes it even gives me relief from headaches. Eucalyptus is another favorite of mine it really makes my lungs and sinuses open up and Ive read that it can help with the common cold and flu. Green tea also helps me feel batter and gives me some relief from minor aches and pains.Hops is a bit more fun one a huge part of beer it gives me a mild euphoria and it tastes really amazingly earthy. Lavender is something I vaporize after Ive been sick because it has antibacterial properties. peppermint might be my favorite because it tastes great and makes me feel even better. im really happy that Ive gotten into this hobby and and hope that I could help others get into it as well ,promos,cyd1gpd,1,t5_2r4w1

I can see this being a major issue as far as reviews if they ever sell the device on a site that has them like Amazon.As for more likely legitimate sources it has an addon to watchrecord live tv somehow as one of the added rewards but with a quick run through i couldnt find many more details on that.

My Review When I downloaded the app I was thinking that it was for all consoles. Therefore upon realizing that this is a different kind of app I think it is put together nicely using the new material design by google. A few thing to think about is a search of black ops  should that show results for black ops III should there be a way to the best deals or lowest priced deals and back button from the setting doesnt feel natural trying to exit I feel it should go back to the deals page always and then exit from the deals page when the back button is pressed. Lastly with this app moving forward it is smooth but some people want more information.It is a great start and I cant wait to see the next iteration ,promos,czcncz2,1,t5_2r4w1

Its pretty obvious that the root of it is government courts and law enforcement locking people in cages. Profit isnt inherently evil its not evil that a farmer grows food and sells it to me. Profiting off of an evil thing is evil. Because of the thing in this case locking people in cages.When people blame profit I wonder if they actually want to solve anything. As if theres any kind of sane or peaceful way to stop people from profiting. We could however put an end to the idea that its ok to lock people in cages when they havent hurt anybody.,promos,czwnjzv,5,t5_2r4w1
6575525,0,t3_412842,I have never really thought to write a review on anything really but here i go.With the app when i first opened it i felt as if i had used it before as in it was very easy to travel across the app finding good across cross engine whether it was steam or origin for example which to me is a big thumbs up! The look of the app is quite simple but not boring not too crazy but not over the top and being able to have a wishlist will make this app quite convenient and useful.However i did find that the category title sort of just blends in to much to all of the games and i would like to see an option somewhere to choose the category you want whether it is editors picks whats hot or even a category that has recent games on sale.  Also to have price range highest percentage sales and something like how steam has the Under  and Under  category. The last thing i would like to see on this app would have to be a currency change something that will really make this Razer app stand out and to take initiative to changing the currency yourself Yourself being the Razer producers of the app unlike how steam is in USD worldwide sort of thing. This is a bit far fetched and i may or may not be aiming high but Razer should be the one to rule them allI hope i have been helpful to you in anyway,promos,czzgp1b,1,t5_2r4w1

I have good Tanking skills but the Cruisers in the Detention Facilities still rip me apart. It might have to do with the fact that the biggest hull I can fly properly right now are TFaction Cruisers but I cant so much as dent those Cruisers while they rip through my tank as if it was paper.I do understand that there has to be some difficulty to those event sites especially if there are items like the TEBS Interfaces so people dont just farm the newbie friendly sites. Offering a site that effectively excludes any newer toonsplayers is not a solution however.And since I cant participate in the event Ill have to pay the probably absurdly high prices for the limited items that drop during the event which just adds insult to injury.  I have obviously not taken part in last years events and dont know if those were more accessible for newer players but I imagine they were similar to this  So please if you do these kinds of events make sure everybody can participate.In terms of feedback regarding FactionsStory ArcsImmersion et al.  Id love for these events to tie into the overarching Story. Sure most of Eves story is written by its players but there still is an overarching story afaik and having these events have relevance in the game universe would be awesome for immersions sake even as someone who does not rp.,promos,d15kabj,3,t5_2r4w1

7129119,0,t1_d1od6e3,Okay Sample sizes were not cited that I could find for the gay marriage results.  This leads me to be quite suspicious of exactly what sort of data we are looking at. Though I value Pew Research as a source after visiting their site and reading about their sample collection they too list the difficulties of obtaining accurate results. Im not saying there wasnt opposition to gay rights inforce but how exactly do we know this is my question. Sanders and civil rights vs Hillary  Hillary Clinton did work toward civil rights in her youth  as did Sanders in his youth the Lewis comment has since been declared false but the rest of the article stands.  Im not going to cite the Goldwater Girl thing with Hillary at all here it was hard to find a Bernie article that didnt reference it but I think thats not an accurate portrayal of Hillary.  As for what they have done lately for minorities and the poor?  This is what we see of Hillary This is what we see of Bernie   Neither has a recent track record I would consider completely worthy of a jewel in their crown to be honest.  Both were once young very outspoken activists. Benie is not antiscience Hillary isnt either  Both seem to feel quite strongly about some of the same issues Clinton just uses more words.  You cant make that point its not true.  As for nuclear reactors realistically though nuclear energy is clean energy it comes at a price because workers get bored or tired or are angry at their SO or are following current policy or have inadequate funding to take care of the plant.  These things are concerning. Bernie vs Hillary for big business donations Were...talking about a man that got . of his donations from outside sources vs her  of super PACs and other groups.  Come on.  Debating this is a nonstarter.  My family is in agribusiness and donated to Sanders yet its a familyrun establishment.  Do these numbers speak to that?  Not all donators are large companies.  Also googling opensecrets brought this Hillary article up at the top  Why should she lie about this? Interest groups influencing politics?  Well though I care neither way anymore about the Monsanto debate Obama elected many past Monsanto workers that backed him to government offices.  Later he signed into law legislation that protected Monsanto  This happens all the time. If you think politicians arent influenced by their backers and that Im crazy than youre free to think so.  Just like youre free to vote for Hillary and I support your right to do so.  If you believe that she is legitimately the correct individual to direct the U.S. then please vote for her but please also look into everything she says and has done and also what the other candidates say and have done before casting your vote.,promos,d1oi11n,1,t5_2r4w1

Police says that man disappeared or committed suicide people learn their lesson not to speak out and everyone keeps a low profile for fear of spontaneously committing suicide.But beat a man or pepper spray him in public and soon  people will upload it to YouTube from every angle you can think of.

7268206,0,t1_d235rtb,Hey jjason!This piggybacks a bit on a response to a similar question below. Moment uses very precise vibrations to draw shapes and patterns on your skin and integrates with realtime data which your phone doesnt do with its vibration notifications. So for example while cell phones can give you simple buzzing notifications for calls and texts Moment can give you a unique tactile sensation for each contact in your phone booksomething that overtime your brain will naturally develop intuition for. This means that you could be getting a call during a meeting and know exactly who is calling you without ever having to distract your attention. Another example of timers being different than a cell phone timer while you can set a timer on your phone that buzzes and alerts you at the end of a certain period of time with Moment you could set a  minute timer that produces the sensation of  minutes passing as a tactile sensation of a circle being drawn around your wrist at a revolution of once per  minutes.This intuitive way of conveying information is something that Moment does which you cant accomplish with the simple buzzers in cellphones and other current wearable devices. A couple other features that are completely different than the alarms and timers that we have in the pipeline being able to feel the change financial markets as a sensation on your wrist cycling and running integrations that give you indication to slow down or speed up based on set goals. One of the most exciting things about out device is its ability to integrate with real time data and provide that as a intuitive sensation if you used Moment to monitor the movements of a given fund youd develop a sort of ESP for that market developing an intuitive sense for how well the market is doing. If you want to learn more about how the brain can learn to process this information and make it intuitive weve written a blog post about the science behind sensory augmentation. ,promos,d24cfad,1,t5_2r4w1

Perfectly balanced merely means that the motor doesnt need any extra balancing mud to be completely? balanced. Manufacturers dynamically balance the motor and add mud to get the motor balanced however most allow for  room for error meaning the motors arent as balanced as they could possibly be. These motors are ridiculously smooth.This is because the balancing machine will ask or mud to be placed counter weighting a heavy spot in the motor the mud is applied by hand sometimes the tiniest amount of mud is too much but it achieves  or  balance so the manufacturer will consider it done and move to balancing the next motor. We actually take the time to add and remove the mud and keep rebalancing until there is literally no mud needing to be added or removed to achieve balance.,promos,d2kpful,1,t5_2r4w1

So arguably my MEP is more representative than my MP.Furthermore to address the spirit of your complaint I view it as quite the opposite. Its not us vs them. The rest of Europe acts as a buffer to undue governmental bias. For example the UK Tory party is quite cavalier about workers rights but combined with the rest of Europe they cant bulldoze that without enough support. We can also balance short sighted government support for specific industries eg fishing against the interests of the rest of us who care about sustainability of stocks.,promos,d3qz2rt,5,t5_2r4w1

In the modern world it is probably about  of Egypts population. It does seem rather unlikely though considering the sizes of the populations involved and the difficulty in integrating such a small population into their armies.

He stops the truck and hands the lumberjack a piece do chalk  Get out and mark the front of that big tree over there he says winking at the owner.The lumberjack gets out walks around the tree while looking at the ground stops and puts an X on the tree and returns to the truck.How in the heck do you know that is the front of the tree? the foreman asks sarcastically.Cause somebody took a shit behind it. the lumberjack replied.He got the foremans job.,promos,d4g9k5y,3,t5_2r4w1

Of course I do hear liberal arguments that Trump is a racist because his father was a racist but that holds about as much weight as the argument that Obama is communist radical because his father wasdont you think?  If you then add in the actual history Trump has of being antiracist with his golf courses in spite of social pressure of hiring the first female skyscraper archetect and of his support for LGBT issues see his speech at the Republican convention.  He was accused of having New York values for shits sake.  Its pretty fucking hard to make the case that hes a bigot thats why you have to resort to a  year old failed court case.gtHe recently saidin an interview that he wasnt sure whether or not there was racial bias in the application of police violence.This does not mean that hes a racist.  A recent Harvard study run by a black professor whos probably soon to get fired showed that in fact police are less likely to use lethal force on a black man than a white man in similar situations.  Once you control for behavior the racial disparity in police violence largely disappears.  This subject in particular is one which I would love to discuss in more detail.gtBut all racists are trump supporters.Actually not all racists are Trump supporters.  Even if you think the KKKs endorsement of Hillary was disengenuous there can be no doubt that there are a lot of minorities who are racists against whites that hate Trump and are even willing to beat his supporters in the street in front of cameras.But for the sake of argument lets assume that that kind of racism doesnt count or is impossible for whatever gobbledygook reason.  It still doesnt count as proof that Trump is a racist.  Perfect examplethe father of the Orlando shooter is a Hillary supporter.  Is that evidence that Hillary is an Islamic fundamentalist?  In fact Im willing to bet that all radical muslim Americans are Hillary supporters.  Is it now fair for me to say that Hillary has radical Islamic tendencies?

Give me a break.gt His appearance helped bring hope and comfort to the people down there.True but only because the areas hit by the flood are VERY conservative areas.  The people who live there would find hope and comfort in almost anything done by any Republican while criticizing and dismissing almost anything done by Democrats.gt The states democratic governor even had positive things to say about Trumps visit.The governor praised the trip because it was the right thing to do.  The absolute worst move for Edwards would have been to criticize Trumps visit and bring politics into the situation at a time where people are suffering in his own backyard.gt Its expected that the president visits when there is a national disaster in this country.This is precisely why Obama didnt visit.  It isnt because he couldnt be bothered but because he understands the difference between actions and appearances.  Obama has almost made it a matter of policy for his administration to eschew doing things simply for the benefit of how they look.  Obama knows full well that he can do anything he needs to do to help flood victims without having to physically visit Louisiana.  Visiting areas affected by natural disasters is purely ceremonial and doesnt actually accomplish anything except placing a huge burden on local law enforcement resources who are usually already stretched pretty thin at those times.Also reasonable people understand that presidents dont get days off.  Like Nancy Reagan said Presidents dont get vacations  they just get a change of scenery.  The responsibilities of the president arent simply excused or ignored when hes on vacation.  He can conduct the business expected of his office from anywhere on earth.

8725906,0,t1_d6wa791,As the Washington Post article your article cites points out the battle he had with the town council wasnt so much about desegregating clubs in palm beach it was about Trump refusing to tolerate other restrictions noise crowds etc. on how he could operate the club and using this issue of segregated clubs to highroad them which Ill concede was an effective tactic. As Snopes saysgtBut Trump didnt literally buy a segregated club as when he purchased MaraLago in  it was a private estate and not a club. It wasnt until the s that Trump sought to convert the property into a private club whereupon the town council imposed a series of restrictions upon his plans. Those restrictions didnt require that Trump operate a segregated club rather Trump battled those restrictions in part by making the point that it was unseemly for the town to impose greater restrictions upon his plans to open an integrated club than they did upon existing segregated clubsSo a more accurate but still fairly oversimplified argument boils down toTown Council Wed like you to promise to keep the noise down etc.Trump I dont see you asking for these kind of things from the racist clubs.Town Council Uh what?... ok never mind.Donald Trump deciding not to segregate his new private club isnt really all that admirable. Just like its not terribly admirable for me to not shout a slur at someone. I suppose its good that he brought the issue of segregated clubs to wider attention with this story but his motivation to do so seemed to be unrelated to that.It was hardly a courageous stance in any case as the Washington Post article also pointed outgtWyett who is Jewish said he would hear Trump talk with pride about MaraLagos nondiscriminatory policy but wondered if it was a business strategy Was he smart enough to realize that Palm Beach is about  percent Jewish and he was not going to attract the old guard anyway?In any case Im sure Donald Trump doesnt think hes racist I expect he has black friends insofar as he has friends and I dont think hes a secret Klansman. But racism is not some magic spell that just makes you hate people of a certain group and lash out against them at every opportunity. Racism is an insidious patchwork of unconscious attitudes and stereotypes that every one of us can be susceptible to at any given moment and can have an aggregate affect on sections of the population without anyone really deciding it should. Donald Trump holds many racist beliefs and when hes called out on any one of them his response boils down to Im not racist so thats not a racist attitude. He makes no effort to understand why people are upset by the implications of his statements and the lack of empathy or selfawareness he has about this stuff is astounding. The problem with Donald Trumps campaign is that his fierce antiimmigration well until last night when he proposed something that sounded a lot like amnesty and antiMulsim stances have made him very attractive to racist and bigoted audiences. Since he doesnt have a lot of concern for crafting his message with any care his impromptu style against political correctness is appealing to people who dont think theyre racist though they have racist beliefs and are tired of being told that they are racist. He makes very little effort to tell his overtly racist audiences that they are wrong for liking him. Trump is a kind of racism agnostic suggesting that institutional racism doesnt really exist anymore in any meaningful way. The problem with this attitude is that it basically tells the large number of minority groups that are the perpetual victims of racism that they are imagining things and that they should quit their whining. Minority audiences have a hard time trusting him because he doesnt trust them when they say something is wrong. So is Trump racist? Insofar that he demonstrates racist and bigoted beliefs yes. Is he capable of still doing good things on race issues? Also yes but he hasnt lately. ,promos,d6wdpid,1,t5_2r4w1

9080018,0,t3_52rqwi,I played for a few hours this weekend  very solid effort for an alpha game! I cant wait for new ships to be released and new weapons powerups etc to be added! The roguelike style of gameplay was both equal parts innovative and enjoyable much akin to my Civ V addiction I kept saying to myself  more turn  more turn to try and get further into space.  thing I didnt really care for was the  challenges wouldnt expire after a while. I had one that was blow up  fuel tanks that I felt was damn difficult and I wanted to clear off the list because I was having a lot of trouble getting it done but was unable to and so it just took up space on my challenge list. Pros  Good graphics stylistic not hyperrealistic but done very well Quick amp maneuverable space combat think battlestar galactica vipers Enjoyable roguelike gameplay is addictive and an interesting take on traditional space fighters dogfighting titles Good difficulty level. Not oppressively hard but definitely keeps you on your toes Lots of room for more content!Cons  Not a ton of current content  as it stands in this point of the Alpha only yields a few hours of gaming before it became a tad repetitive. But thats to be expected in an Alpha release. Challenges for your excursions dont expire or give you an option to replace them. If youre unsure of what you need to do to complete your  challenges youre stuck with them until you figure the outbeat them No MultiplayerSolid effort. Right now Id say Id give it a .

What would be the benefits of being in the molecular engineering program instead?    What are some general qualities of an ideal candidate? Like in terms of GPA amount of research experience GRE scores etc. How do you weight the importance of those factors against one another?    And lastly how is taking a year or so after undergrad to work in industry viewed as opposed to going to going grad school right after undergrad?

I stopped receiving email notifications of new releases on Spotify a while ago even with my settings enabled.I like the website includes news releases videos! Having releases sorted by release date is epic! A few things I would like to point out I connected my Facebook account on which I have liked a total of  Music pages however when I go to my artists after connecting my account it appears only my Spotify artists. Is this a bug? or MuzeRoom will start picking only new artists I like after connect the account? Would love to see Youtube integration as I have a Favorite playlist on which I include a lot of videos would love to import artists from there so I can have all artist centralized to get alerts about releases.Thanks for sharing.

The fact that they took Stand By Me and used it as the opening song  a song I have an emotional connection to along with my wife and used it at the end of the game as well made it a strong hit with me.

The AI of course decides to send the people on the boat after me. So these people are jumping to their deaths in an attempt to kill me while Im swimming just fine.The kicker?

10875420,0,t3_5vcpyr,Lets say for a moment that we are in fact bringing samples back from Mars and that these samples actually contain some form of extraterrestrial life. This would definitely pose a risk of some sort. A really major example is the European colonization of the Americas and how a common easily fought disease in Britain was absolutely deadly in America. This ocean spanning disease could be infinitely worse in a case that spans immense distances in space especially in one that traverses planets. Society would view the discovery in awe of course until the next big thing comes down the social media drain. That is unless this life that we discover ends up being dramatic in an extraordinarily positive or negative way. Then it would be in our scope for quite some time. Seeing life in some shape or form would certainly bring us as a society together but when countries cant even bond across races or gender whats to say we could even treat another set of intelligent life out there as an equal? We as a human race have an obligation to treat ALL life as precious because for all we know were all thats out there in the big black soup of space and if we happen to stumble upon another set of life that life no matter big or small should be treated with care.,promos,de1q0at,2,t5_2r4w1

I just couldnt see why anyone saw Clinton as a good gamble in any sense besides having bad political experience.We do have a shifting climate for jobs coming up in the next  years why do you think I voted for Trump? From what Ive seen and read he understands economics and jobs extremely well and knows how to work to anticipate things like robots and AI. Like him or not he is unlike any other Republican weve ever had to the point where its almost unfair to call him a Republican by definition. He was at war with half of the party for Gods sake hes everything the old GOP establishment DIDNT want.I think one thing that Trump wants to do in bringing the focus back to home I wouldnt call it isolation but it is in some senses is make the US a more desirable trading partner to the rest of the world and in that bringing more opportunity and prosperity to our own people.

11442901,0,t1_dft0tuy,from bitcoin.pdf the original whitepaper written by bitcoins creator satoshi nakamoto.gtThe proofofwork also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on oneIPaddressonevote it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proofofwork is essentially oneCPUonevote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain which has the greatest proofofwork effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block an attacker would have to redo the proofofwork of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.,promos,dft1jax,3,t5_2r4w1

Some do it on a tablet with a stylus. Some do it on paper and then throw the paper away.All of these have drawbacks. The whiteblackboard limits your mobility. The tablet can be a little bit too heavy and their screens are often just a little bit too small. Scratch paper generates a lot of trash.Something that is the size of a normal sheet of typing paper either A or lettersized depending on where you are in the world that weighs about the same as a typical spiral bound notebook or a clipboard with a decent stack of typing paper clipper in would be useful to a lot of people.According to their site the Wipebook Pro is .x which is lettersized and weights g.

Thats the same weight as my clipboard with  sheets of typing paper so it looks like it could be a good alternative.  pages  pages per sheet would be enough for the scratch writing needs of anything I can recall having worked on.My one big concern would be the markers. On my clipboard with typing paper I use Pilot G Ultra Fine Point .mm pens. That allows for legible superscripts and subscripts even on small symbols or allows legible subscripts and superscripts on subscripts or superscripts. I dont think their markers would be able to handle things as small.,promos,dga9lqg,3,t5_2r4w1

IT teachers tell their students about the Disposable Inkjet Phenomenon mostly because of HP and its ilk racing to the bottom. It was stupid when Xerox was breaking stuff with antifeatures and locking consumers out of fixing it in the s and its stupid now.,promos,dgms5no,2,t5_2r4w1
