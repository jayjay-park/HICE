1327864,0,t3_29a6nw,Dont do that Sly Cooper stylechange bullshit. Keep it like Jak amp Daxter The precursor legacy but with updated graphics. That would be a movie similar to Ratchet amp Clank and Sly Cooper.  But a darker themed movie would suit Jak  and . Personally Id like them to do it the first way probably a more comedic and children friendly movie. They would pretty much have to make Jak talk though and not with his bad ass attitude like in Jak  but with the attitude he has in the entire first game. More light and slapsticky not so pissed all the time either P Or most of the time anyway. Daxter is already a perfect character for games or movies. Far as story goes I think they should have like adventures before JampD but with Daxter still being an Ottsel. That might ruin it for some people but I dont know. It could also be after JampD but before they time travel. Maybe some other places in the same world. That we havent seen yet. But the overall feel not the dark stuff Jak  brought.,jakanddaxter,cij02v7,5,t5_2t4tn

4163268,0,t3_38gcrv,My YouTube channel has primarily consisted out of Theatre content but Ive always wanted to start a Lets Play series.  I finally took the plunge and bought some rudimentary equipment for the task and am currently trying to build a passionate audience. The game I decided to start this off with was of course one of my favorite games Jak and Dater The Precursor Legacy. Im new to this process but am definitely passionate about doing this. Let me know any questions and thoughts yall have for me!Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen,jakanddaxter,crutloj,2,t5_2t4tn

6778930,0,t3_48h2cn,Personally I feel Insomniac would struggle with IPs that they didnt initially come up with.  That studio had its own artistic vision and motives for coming up with its titles and it SHOWED while were at it Sunset Overdrive for PC pleeeeease!! so being able to tackle Jak might be more of a risk considering that had a more ornate set of undertones than RampC Resistance and SO.As for selling rights... You all DO realise that its Sony Computer Entertainment that has the rights and leases the IPs to developers that are interested in working with them right? P,jakanddaxter,d0kobwr,1,t5_2t4tn

Much more fun to do without guns that Jak II in my opinion. Id recommend this run to anyone who wants to change things up next time they want to play Jak .Thanks to everyone for their support through this series and see you all for the next Crazy Jak related run I do! ,jakanddaxter,d6k3eah,3,t5_2t4tn

9637540,0,t1_da0mjhn,Thanks for the reply! Ill definetely look Into this. I know there are PS emulators out there and hopefully a Jak crack atleast try messing around with the files. Maybe just equipping Jak with the Krimzon Guard armor Is easier as you said but then It might not sync with Jaks physics.,jakanddaxter,da10xha,3,t5_2t4tn
9792625,0,t1_dak5do1,I remember seeing an interview with Jason and Andy talking about how they saw GTA was becoming really popular but younger people couldnt play it and that they were wanting to fill that niche with the Jak and Daxter franchise. Good decision in my books. It allowed them to have a smooth transition between Crash Bandicoot and Uncharted and also provided the qualities that made GTA great to the younger demographic.,jakanddaxter,dak5j9m,1,t5_2t4tn

11433581,0,t3_637c4a,This is just one of many many classic PS titles given emulation support on the PS for the whole PS on PS campaign. For other series it hasnt led to new games afaik so it probably wont for JampD either necessarily.

11733411,0,t3_67ba8l,Considering the interest in the Crash Bandicoot remake a Jak and Daxter one would be a smart business move  but it could also hurt Knack  which is shaping up well. Bluepoint could be working with Nintendo or MS as well both have also shown willingness with remaking games. Even Oddworld Inhabitants an indie is remaking Oddworld titles theyve already remade first game and they could be working with them. However they have worked well with Sony so it is likely a Sony developed game. I would guess it wouldnt be Jak and Daxter due to the PS classic. One which I think it could be is Medievil. Its a long dormant property that was very popular was a PS title just like Crash and there is nothing really like it so it can stand out.,jakanddaxter,dgq0g0i,3,t5_2t4tn
