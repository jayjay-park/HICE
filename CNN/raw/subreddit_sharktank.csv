6958754,0,t3_4aw1tq,Ive pitched twice and had some success so heres what Ive learnedThey give out wristbands starting at  so I recommend lining up around . Theyre going to give you a numbered wristband at  and depending on your number tell you what time to come back. Youll then be free to go back to your car or go get food or whatever you want until you need to go back. Then youll get back in line and youll go one by one into the place where the casting directors are and youll be pitching right next to other people. You get one minute to do your pitch but its not hard timed just make sure its concise and doesnt run on for too long. Then theyll ask you a few questions relating to your pitch and send you on your way! They do a great job of making you feel comfortable and its really laid back. Theyre really just looking at your personality and if youll be a good fit for TV the hard questions and real info comes later on.

10909555,0,t1_de53cos,Once this insanity is over Im going to either write a really long post or a short book because I learned a lot of really tough lessons from all of this.It really shouldnt be a shame that the deal fell through because every entrepreneur should strive to give it their all. Licensing would be taking a short cut that would finally put some money in my pocket but at the same time it would chop off any future for Pinblock. If that was the plan all along then why bother with such a difficult task of bringing in a completely new product educating the market going against one of the biggest companies in the world? It wouldve been much easier to make a simple cash cow reselling Alibaba crap on a Shopify website or Private Label a generic product and focus on FBA.Ill tell you something that I havent yet talked about publicly. I took the deal and I regretted it deeply... but shortly after it became a huge relief. Ive been through so much shit pulling this company up  my business partner leaving running out of money in business and personally realizing that due to ugly packaging I cant move most of my inventory... collections agents calling me for over a year clients not paying for their wholesale orders from me forgetting to file important tax documents and then getting harassed by the fed...All of it just got to me. I had multiple mental breakdowns flipped out on people close to me and saw no way out. I was truly depressed.OLeary deal seemed like a blessing. Hed take the wheel. I would finally rest for a bit. It was all almost over. I wished... Reality slapped me hard and I was soon all alone again. I realized that theres no way things could be worse so might as well use the publicity and try to pull a big move for myself and Pinblock.And thats exactly what Im doing right now.Im building out a solid team bringing in different investors collaborating with some serious heads in the industry... Its all in the making right now but in a few months Ill be pulling off the biggest stunt yet and if it all goes according to plan the credit would be fully owed to that deal falling through. I also matured as an entrepreneur more in the last few months than I did over the past year and thats really something.There really is no easy way out and if you try to find shortcuts youre only cheating yourself.Keep hustlingamp wish me luck ,sharktank,de58rqk,1,t5_2se9c
