4683868,0,t1_ctkxaph,I just checked out your website... It looks great. One question tho does the POS track items that you marked as sold out and track items you sell like other POS systems? It would be nice if it lets you know in a report when you sold out of an item so you can see how fast things sell out and if you need to make more of an item.,foodtrucks,ctky48k,1,t5_2sop2

7670795,0,t1_d3e2vuy,Aww yeah tin can revamps! Congrats on your impending opening you have to be so excited right now! Best of luck to you!Thank you so much for your idea on the epoxy! That is so brilliant and it doesnt leave a whole lot of room for tiles to get cracked from road vibration. Ive had to replace everything in mine from the belly pan up frame floor siding door window roof vents... so Ive already been getting very busy with the caulk gun but Ill be sure to give it another bead once Im finished. I assume when you talk about the wood youre talking the original wood paneling not the frame correct? ,foodtrucks,d3e4ig0,1,t5_2sop2
11108280,0,t3_5yk542,Often the food trucks making the money are the ones with exclusive rights at private venues with lots of trafficconcession contracts. Your town might have a lot of these venues. Vending curbside in a tourist town might do very well in the right location but expect the nearby restaurants to try to stop you. Dont forfeit without trying though it may well be that paying an established lawyer  to write some letters could clear your way finefood trucks are very hip and almost no tourist towns still ban them outright except for a few neolithic ignorant idiots Cashiers NC Im looking at you.But a concession contract would also probably save you the cost of buying a tow vehicle because you would just leave the trailer in place and of insuring that tow vehicleremember that trucktrailer combinations require two different insurance policies. A consumer auto policy will not cover either the truck or the trailer if you wreck. You can pay a lot of site fees with the money you just saved on vehicle  insurance.Commissary kitchen totally depends on the jurisdiction. In mine we are clearly required by law to park at a commissary and have a written contract with one but this is never enforced and our HD pretends that the food truck itself is a commissary. Go ask the HD what the real story is HDs above the inspector level are more helpful and far less malicious than most restaurant employees believe. ,foodtrucks,der43wk,3,t5_2sop2
