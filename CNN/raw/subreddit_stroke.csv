1298346,0,t3_28wud6,Heres a portion of the methods section from a research report that addresses your questionScripts were trained one phrase at a time. A cueing hierarchy was used to train new material phrase repetition choral reading of phrases with the clinician and then independent production. Written phrases were available for the participant to consult. When the participant could produce anewly trained phrase independently at least  consecutive times the next script phrase was added to previously mastered portions of that script. In addition to treatment sessions participants were expected to practise scripts at home for  minutes per day. Participants were given audio cassettes containing client and clinicianproduced versions of the script portions being mastered...... Throughout script training verbatim production and repetition was practised and verbatim recitation was the standard for mastery. Once a script was mastered generalisation training was initiated. The clinician purposefully varied her responses and comments to help the participants make their scripts more resilient and more flexible. At this point monologue scripts were practised in conversational form. In addition seven different novel conversation partners students and faculty members participated in conversations.... At the end of generalisation training for a given script novel partners were instructed to try tothrow the script participant by saying something appropriate but surprising during the conversation.Youmans G. Holland A. Muoz M. L. amp Bourgeois M. . Script training and automaticity in two individuals with aphasia. Aphasiology  . This report was for conversation scripts so the part at the end about asking a question to throw someone off during a conversation isnt exactly relevant but the idea still is i.e. hierarchically increase practice demands via progressively longer chains of connected speech and more distracting environments.  The paper is a bit old in the sense that the current technology gives us a few more advantages as far as practice.  For example some people with aphasia benefit from repeating what someone says when they focus on the other persons mouth movements.  This simply gives another layer of cuing.  Ive had clients where I would create video scripts that included a closeup of my mouth saying the phrases so they could watch and repeat.  Some clients also benefit from have the text in addition to the mouthfocus visible.  The point here isnt necessarily to recommend this approach to script training.  The main thing is to find out what kind of cuing supports errorfree practice use that approach in massive repetition and gradually remove cuing supports until the person is performing independently in a variety of contexts.I also had a client who had a small bluetooth headphone he would wear and he would trigger a phrase on his iphone before speaking e.g. replaying the phrase immediately before ordering a cup of coffee at Starbucks.  Ive also had clients with aphasia use and iPad with a teleprompter app to give a short speech.  If you have a local Toastmasters club you might consider contacting them.  Toastmasters caters to people who have a fear of public speaking.  They support each other and its a wonderful place for people with aphasia if they have a certain amount of speech ability to practice speaking in front of groups of people.  Ive had a few clients who became members and it has played a big role in their recovery and confidence.,stroke,cifoik8,5,t5_2qsry
5585933,0,t3_3rmri5,The brain is particularly good at figuring out vision after a stroke.  There is a study done where people wore upside down goggles and their vision adjusted to make it seem like they were seeing things right side up. I had a stroke that did something similar to my vision and it took about  months before I could read again and another few months until I could read well.  Within a year I didnt notice any difference in my vision from before the stroke.  I did do lots of vision training and I was lucky.  Its not a guarantee that things will get better but its definitely possible!  ,stroke,cwphjku,6,t5_2qsry

10296977,0,t3_5mbl7s,Depends on the severity of the stroke comorbidities time since the stroke and location of the stroke. I work in a rehab unit and Ive seen some people recover  and Ive seen other recover . But dont give up! Most improvement is in the first year but Ive seen people make improvement years after their stroke! ,stroke,dcb7v3n,1,t5_2qsry
10932109,0,t1_de6mrg1,Thanks was the feeding tube more pleasant than the ng tube. Because she keeps asking for soda or water everytime she wakes up and I know how miserable it is to have your mouth that dry. I do not understand why they will not come back and do the swallowing test when she is awake. That is one of the few things i remember after my accident how miserable it was with a dry tongue. I even asked for more contrast during one of my scans because I was so thirsty. I wrote that paragraph right after they left I just thought it was the wrong approach especially to not even have the neurologist there the one everyone is referring judgement to to speak with me. ,stroke,de7kj5i,1,t5_2qsry

Im a big tech head but after my stroke none of it worked for me too hard to read buttons too small left ignore meant that the button I aimed at was never the one I hit it was exhausting and frustrating. I also felt broken lonely and worthless.  the first time my adorable PT put an arm around me in a gesture of compassion I nearly cried.  There are  things you can do for her in person opening things helping at meals grooming all of it will show her that you think shes worth the effort.  My OT told me that I had to learn to accept assistance with grace and if I worked hard at rehab I would have  years to pay back those who stepped up to help.  I suspect you will have to gently overcome her fear and self doubt to get her motivated to fight for her second chance.  This is going to be her temporary new normal for a while please dont let her disappear down the hole she is digging.    I think your presence and caring and love might work miracles.  best of luck to you both and for happy healing and hopeful rehab.,stroke,dgpe1ve,1,t5_2qsry
