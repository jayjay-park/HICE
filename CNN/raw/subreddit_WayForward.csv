493389,0,t3_1zk0ye,Since it wont likely ever go on sale Id recommend it simply to fulfill the link between the original and Pirates Curse. It does play well with great usage of color to boot. Not as difficult as the original by far thatll be a negative or a positive depending on the player. Soundtracks groovyIf youre on Steam though and wouldnt mind playing it on there the likelihood of a Steam sale for Riskys Revenge is higher than the likelihood for an eShop sale. Granted youd hafta wait until RR actually launches on Steam  itll be a couple of months yet.,WayForward,cfwcopx,2,t5_2ydfc

Please dont link to your video playlist if someone likes this video they will seek out your videos themselves instead of being pushed in your face.
