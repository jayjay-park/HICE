Rape often requires penetration so unless they are kinky you are looking at a different crime Sexual Battery ect.Rape often requires force in addition to lack of Consent so simply being drunk wouldnt be enough. In California where I practice law taking someones clothes off against their will is seen as force. More conservative states often require more. Traditionally the person had to prove she fought back to show their was force.Drunk is an issue for Consent. If you are drunk enough you are unable to give consent. Minor is a whole other issue for statutory rape. Often with minors you dont have to show Force or Consent just the penetration. Statutory rape can be both minors raped or just the male it goes back to how penetration is defined. ,MRSelfPostCopies,cerh1ef,1,t5_2tmme
