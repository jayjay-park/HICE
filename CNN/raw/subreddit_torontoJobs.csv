5745608,0,t1_cx8d5rr,We dont have time to check out the job fairs to the level of detail wed like. Our main check is to try and ensure that the organizer behind the job fair is named. Beyond that we highly recommend that you do your own research to check them out.That said if you come across a questionable event do let us know and we will check it out further and remove it if its questionable. Thanks for the heads up.,torontoJobs,cx9arjs,2,t5_2s8x5
5909211,0,t3_3w8cdg,I recruit for Supply Chain Management from time to time. That being said Im rarely the person to assist in a career switch. I facilitate career changes but generally introducing an experienced person within an industry to that same industry or a relatively similar one.Glassdoor.com will be of great use to you as you do this research.Employers vary. Some dont need the education they just want the experience others want it on the resume but dont really worry much about where.What is your specific end goal. i.e. I want to work in SCM for XYZ Company or ABC Company?,torontoJobs,cxu8axv,1,t5_2s8x5

6509625,0,t3_44s4gv,That is a lot of money to be charging someone for a desk in the corner of your office imho.What is the upside to this compared to working from home? No privacy literally back to back with strangers that may be great or may be a huge pain in the ass. A folding chair and and Ikea table? That shared printer will be a great idea until one person runs a big print job and you decide it s not included  anymore. So if they are already near downtwon great but why would they pay to commute to an office your committed to for the month when there are plenty of office space to share offers and locations throughout the city. They wont be on the lease i imagine so you can just cancel th eoffer at anytime too. Sorry but this looks like you are trying to offset your rent in the cheapest way possible.,torontoJobs,czsn8fo,6,t5_2s8x5

9983643,0,t3_5iid1m,Remember you get what you pay for. This sounds like something that will benefit the firm for sure. But I cant imagine anyone remotely qualified for what you want that would work for a few dollars an hour more than a retail gig.,torontoJobs,db8wanv,2,t5_2s8x5
10212649,0,t3_5m888q,A soleproprietorship should be enough for your first contract. Speak with the agency to clarify their policy just in case...they are technically your employer and will be happy to help you.A corporation is expensive and kind of a pain to set up but something to think about if you start doing contracts from multiple employers in a year.Sole proprietorship can be done online or at some Service Ontario locations. You can register a unique name for the company but its easier to use your own name I think youre required to do an extra step if you have a name other than your own for Sole Proprietorship....but double check with the agency to make sure what they need first. Also a good time to ask them if they do any deductions if not youll have to make sure your CPP EI taxes etc. are paid.Hope this helped.,torontoJobs,dc1ntpb,5,t5_2s8x5
10270538,0,t1_dc70nz2,Learn about Azure and how to deploy and manage Linux on Azure. If youre going the support route anything about Active Directory and the cloud will be useful.... Its more MS vs Linux but youll need to eventually learn MS unless you wanna get into development. ,torontoJobs,dc87zs4,3,t5_2s8x5
