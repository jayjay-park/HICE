3360928,0,t3_2y153p,If you using version . or above you should be able to use snapshot and restore to copy data to a new index. Much easier than looping through search results. Obviously you wont be able to pick and choose the fields to transfer but based on your query it looks like youre copying everything anyway.,elasticsearch,cpbdcrk,1,t5_2wfpz
5541425,0,t1_cwij1jd,Yes Im using NXLog.I noticed that but I changed it a little bit to do an output per type so I have eventYYYY.mm.dd applicationYYYY.mm.dd. My question is more about whether it makes sense to segregate these log types into their own indexes to keep the field lists cleaner etc.,elasticsearch,cwjyr72,1,t5_2wfpz

6433718,0,t1_czjq9a3,This is very true for the vanilla distribution of Elasticsearch but if your company can pay Elastic does have a paid security product called Shield which solves a lot of these security requirements ,elasticsearch,czks94h,1,t5_2wfpz
6768612,0,t1_d0jhooz,I feel like this is a documentation issue rather than a core DSL issue. A detailed grammar showing what can go where would be great but equally useful would be a MUCH expanded set of examples.Imagine if every page of the official docs had  different examples of that feature each example an increase in complexity over the previous. Even better would be if the examples were live and could be tested out against a real Elasticsearch instance readonly to avoid abuse and edited to try out new things. I recently spotted the redis documentation doing this which is crazy useful ,elasticsearch,d0ji3pt,2,t5_2wfpz

7357943,0,t1_d2e7446,I have tried their elasticsearch service it works great for a simple stack but as they are using v. there are some major bugs that would prevent me from using it in production. Also they have a  node limit with about a TB data limit using the largest instance types.A self managed cluster provides you with the ability to use what ever version you want with no size limits.,elasticsearch,d2ejqdv,1,t5_2wfpz
7792679,0,t1_d3ryay9,THANK YOU! You have no idea how long have I been looking for that!,elasticsearch,d3rydz9,2,t5_2wfpz
7967150,0,t1_d4bh0fi,You can also get it from the the field stats API. It is like the mapping API but it digs the data out of the search index rather than the mapping metadata.,elasticsearch,d4bl071,1,t5_2wfpz
8038153,0,t3_4p95uw,Sorting by doc effectively disables sorting. I imagine you can still get the score with the track scores setting that uloverollercoaster mentioned.,elasticsearch,d4jkaxq,2,t5_2wfpz
9273105,0,t1_d8redfn,Well the next thing Id try would be some sniffer or proxy or to make JMeter save the responses And check what is actually returned.,elasticsearch,d8rfl2f,2,t5_2wfpz
10020456,0,t1_dbdn69i,Im on .. ... Do you agree that I hit a bug because this fix did not fixes snapshots?,elasticsearch,dbdoyxa,1,t5_2wfpz
11748069,0,t3_67mjw6,Maybe something like     curl u USERNAMEPASSWORD X PUT H ContentType applicationjson URLINDEXNAME databinary yourjsonfile.json,elasticsearch,dgro8k5,1,t5_2wfpz
