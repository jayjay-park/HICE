6326954,0,t3_42a9ep,Im still in awe  hours after it ended. The event was lit as fuck and the visuals were beautiful. It exceeded my expectations.My only complaint is that the first two starters were meh as in the crowd wasnt really into it. But when Madeon came out the entire atmosphere of the room changed,madeon,cz8t0lq,4,t5_2smxo

Both are far from perfect but its the highest quality version that exists I believe.EDIT It survived copyright so far as an unlisted so no automatic takedowns but Im gonna test the waters and make the YT video public.,madeon,czlwmy0,4,t5_2smxo

6773310,0,t3_48jei4,Hey all! I dont post here much but a few of you may know me from rporterrobinson. I just wanted to share something with you guys.Obviously Hugo is one of my favorite artists of all time. Ive been listening to his music since I first stumbled across Icarus in . Ive seen him perform  times so far never missing an opportunity when he came through my area. The most recent time was his final date on the Pixel Empire Tour at the  Club in DC. About a week or so before the performance I was wracking my brain trying to come up with a gift idea for Hugo Id never met him at any of the previous dates. Id seen some of the gifts that you and other fans had made for him paintings banners sculptures etc. But I was never very artistic in that respect. I always preferred reading writing and watching films.Needless to say I also spent a lot of time listening to music. Growing up I was into so many different genres. Before dance music I went through a period of listening to tons of hardcore and experimental electronic music. Before that? Blues and free jazz...You get the idea. But after I started with EDM Hugos music was some of the only music that connected with me on every level. It was beautiful and expressive jubilant elegant and very affecting. It had pop appeal but could be enjoyed in a dance setting. Everything from the songwriting to the sound design enthralled me. Sometimes I could see or imagine things so vividly when I listened to his music. So what could I possibly make him to show him just how much his music changed the way I see the world? I realized that there was only way I knew how writing. I would show him as best I could what I saw when I put on his music and closed my eyes.Now Ive never attempted writing a screenplay before. In fact I wasnt even certain if that was the correct term to apply to these ideas I was putting to paper. I had wanted to incorporate found images or collaborate with one of my more artistic friends to more fully flesh out the presentation. Unfortunately I found that I had time for neither of those things. The show was only days away after all and who knows when I was going to see Hugo again? I already had the stories in my head but I needed something physical to give him.There were so many songs to choose from! Before attempting this project I already had basic concepts for Icarus Youre On Pay No Mind and Imperium. But seeing as some of these werent as complete as others and because the Adventure music videos were already made I elected to adapt Technicolor and Finale. So between work and studies I got busy trying to write down as many of the details in my head as I could. I downloaded some scriptformatting software and tried to hash it all out in a few days. Both scripts are far from perfect and Im not even certain how one is supposed to adapt film for music. Maybe if I had more time I could have researched this a little bit more. But regardless Im pretty happy with what I managed to accomplish.The night of the concert I bound what I had written into a white binder and gave it to Hugo. He seemed genuinely excited by the concept of what I had done but I have no idea if hes read them yet coming off the tour hes probably busy. But now that hes at least had the chance of reading them I figured I would make them available to some folks who might also appreciate them you lot.This project was something Id always meant to do but was always intended to be a personal project for myself and less to do with exhibition.So without further delay here they are! Obviously Id appreciate you not publishing them or sharing them anywhere else online. Let me know if you have thoughts or opinions on my material. Its not my intention to edit these in any way since Ive already given the completed set to Hugo but constructive criticism is welcome all the same. I hope you guys enjoy them!,madeon,d0k1clz,3,t5_2smxo

9130500,0,t1_d89blte,just spoke about how dj superfast did not make an appearance at the after party... he laughed and then introduced me to charlie who recorded those dj superfast  ironboard sessions. Charlie is one cool bloke.As for albatross i asked him for a release and he said for now its something he played in his pixel shows only....which was a surprise to me. I hope he misunderstood cause i really wanna see that track out.,madeon,d89cuf9,3,t5_2smxo

10283890,0,t1_dc8bknp,I had never listened to Shuriken before so now I know that the tape effect isnt exclusive to Adventure. Im aware that the original Adventure album ends with Home but the reason I started looking into this was because he released the bonus tracks as a part of Adventure and not some separate album. I guess he did it to simplify publishing but regardless I feel all the extra songs are consistent with the Adventure story and Id love it if the album ended by going full circle with the tape click in the end. Honestly Im probably just looking way to far into it and its just a signature of sorts as you mentioned but Ill keep messing with the idea as I give the album a few relistens.,madeon,dc9qhgv,2,t5_2smxo
