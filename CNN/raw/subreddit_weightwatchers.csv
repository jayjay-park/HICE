9008970,0,t1_d7up4kx,I think you have to ask yourself would I eat this if it wasnt pureedcookedetc.For example You might sit down and eat one apple no points but you probably wouldnt sit down and eat the  apples it takes to make a glass of juice points.  Its the same with soups and sauces.  I might eat a tomato no points but I wouldnt eat the  tomatoes it took to make this  Cup of marinara sauce points.  Its not perfect but its been a good rule of thumb for me when Im not sure.  ,weightwatchers,d7uqju9,3,t5_2rhqy

10172781,0,t3_5lmv4b,Keep in mind that not all meetings are the same. If you find that the one you go to doesnt really resonate with you or you dont feel comfortable try going to a different location if you can or a different evening thats run by a different leader.The first meeting I went to was really not my thing. Everyone else seemed to be having a good time but I just found it awkward. So I tried a different group and it felt right right away. Just different leaders with different styles and approaches of encouraging the members.Also keep in mind that everyone is there for the same reason as you. So theres absolutely no reason to feel nervous or selfconscious. Good luck!!,weightwatchers,dbx52w5,7,t5_2rhqy

Also it allows you to incorporate roughly  percent of your fit points because if you but probably them...you need some of them back. ,weightwatchers,de1z2ni,1,t5_2rhqy

11079020,0,t3_5y41ty,I have been on ww for  months and have lost  lbs.  I do other things besides counting points to lose weight I also use fitbit and myfitnesspal. But ww is really important to me. For about  months I counted both  calories and points.  Counting ww Points really guides you toward  more vegetablefruit protein filled meals. Myfitnesspal has a nutrition pie chart that helps you toward a protein filled diet. If your day is more green then you are eating more protein than carbs and fat. I do strength workouts so I try to make sure to eat protein.  Anyway. I have  cheated many times on ww and still lost weight because that is exactly what the weekly points are for.  No matter what controlling the amount of carbohydrates amp fats in our nutrition is key to losing weight so it doesnt matter how you count them via points or calories but points is easier for me. ,weightwatchers,densp16,6,t5_2rhqy

11370317,0,t1_dfknntt,I heard nothing but positive things about it. I do wonder how many people read all the posts under an entry though.One snarky comment I read on the message board when there were people complaining about being forced to go there when the message board went away was that you couldnt discuss things on Connect. I said that I saw an entry there that had something like  posts  yeah people do discuss things! Sure sometimes its just supportive comments but sometimes its real discussion.When you have real discussions youre going to have snark  as the WW message board showed. It can get really out of hand. Spark People has active message boards with discussions that go quite a while before being shut down. As I said moderation is a real challenge!,weightwatchers,dfksy5c,1,t5_2rhqy
