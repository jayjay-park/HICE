5566922,0,t3_3rb315,As theCmachine said I am a fan of Rudolf Bennitt. Ive never been hunting out there myself but go there frequently for fishingcamping. Lots of land to hunt on though and I absolutely love the area there.As also mentioned  Creeks area is also open to hunting to the public. I would definitely recommend a stand with a good lock especially if you are hunting in more forestedhilly terrain. And I would try to get it setup this weekweekend and flagged with orange tape where possible to alert other hunters who might be wanting to setup a stand that you are there. If you do use the public land let me know how it goes! Ive never hunted in this area I always go down to Southeast MO to hunt with my family. If you have any other questions feel free to PM me and Ill help as I can!,columbiamo,cwn4lnn,1,t5_2rr9b
