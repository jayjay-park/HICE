8618033,0,t1_d6i2dvy,Hi UKFBA. Im happy if my post helped in any way. . When it comes to heat what I have noticed if I get a headache and I go out side in the sun it makes it worse due to the sharp lite of the sun. But most of my headache is due to sugar or muscle heat or the sun make it worse. But what help a lot for me with a muscle muscle headache is a something cold behind my neck or I just try to cool my whole body. The other thing it can be if you are in the heat is to drink water. ,headaches,d6iuqca,1,t5_2u1os
