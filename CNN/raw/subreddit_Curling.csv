In one way you have to play really really fast and the other way really slow. And the curl is really tough to judge. Sometimes the stones curl nothing and sometimes they curl over the whole rink. I prefer to play on dedicated ice because you can judge your speed and your curl much better. But I think you sharp your skills on Arena Ice cause you learn to deal with difficult ice situations much more!,Curling,cmu2go2,1,t5_2rifq

So i dont think we can treat it as the same thing. It took throwing out of the game almost completely. The effect has been too dramatic on the stones sweeping as a whole has been changed.

It all depends on your ice and your throw if the thrower pushes the rock at the end your time will be off.II was at a tournament last weekend ahnd one.of the clubs had very heavy ice first rock I thru  seconds and it bairly got over the hog. It Improved once we had some ends completed but it never got to a point that I was comfortable.Arena ice is generally really fast and would have  second draws.

As pudds pointed out its not easy to take a complicated situation where you were aiming for two and now try to turn that into a blank.The way I understand it now is that you have to pretty much set out to blank the th from the getgo.
