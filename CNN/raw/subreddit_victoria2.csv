4410910,0,t3_3bj37k,Reposted with a few edits and expanded advice.gtOk Im not a Vic superstar but Ive spent at least a few hundred hours on this game  hours of my life just playing the CSA.gt I play with the following house rules for the CSAgt gt  Vickymod Heart of Darknessgt gt  Absolutely no wars in Asia for the entire game.gt gt  No wars in Africa until .gt gt  No expansion beyond MasonDixon line.gt gt  Dont abuse Great Wars and Dismantle CBs for free colonies. You must participate in good faith in Great Wars if you want the spoils.gt gt  Must begin in  A House Divided Start. I know its tempting to start in  and ship all the Yankees off to Brunei and let them rot but we Southrons are men of honor.gt gt gt gt To defeat the Union it takes a bit of luck. And by luck I mean exploiting shitty AI by luring it into a small stack and beating it up with a bigger stack. Do this a couple times and your warscore starts adding up.gt gt After the first war against the Union you need to start building forts on your border. Additionally you need to build some artillery and prepare a battle line. The battle line should stretch from Virginia to the Mississippi. When you mobilize in case of a war you fill out the battle line.gt gt In a war you need to match the Unions troop movements but stay on the defensive. The Rebels need their troops more than the Unionists do. Be alert about Union troop movements you dont want them striking in critical mass against your smaller stacks. When the Union strikes against you move troops in to help the defense. After that if you have overwhelming force you can beat up the retreating Union stack but be careful.gt gt Do not defend any transMississippi land. Stay on the cisMississippi this minimizes the number of provinces you must defend. The Rebel player must be willing to give up entire states if it means winning the war with a few climactic battles.gt gt Speaking of which when the Union comes for you later and they will try to use Add Wargoal to get West Virginia and Kentucky. They have lots of Coal which will help jumpstart your industrialization. But dont take Missouri it is a large and hardtodefend state.gt gt Your goal as the CSA and where your Decisions point you is to fulfill the plan of the Knights of the Golden Circle. You need to balance this with defending yourself from the perfidious Unionists in the North. I recommend avoiding expansionist wars unless you are at a truce with the Union its too risky otherwise. Especially early on when you will be strapped for population and manpower.gt gt In Vickymod you can buy Cuba and Puerto Rico from Spain though in line with the true Rebel spirit I prefer to rip it out of Spains corpse.     Blood for the Blood God    . Either way of getting Cuba and Puerto Rico is pretty easy. Then you need to take Haiti and the Dominican Republic which is also easy. gt gt But youll also need the state of Chihuahua in Mexico. This is more difficult and sad because Mexico is a good friend of the CSA and they wont be your friend after you take their core. But no matter As I like to say     Blood for the Blood God      and we must do whatever it takes to fulfill the plan of the Knights. So you rip Chihuahua out of Mexico and then in the next war against it try to make Mexico your puppet. If the USA sphereallies Mexico then its not the end of the world because then you fight against the USA whom Mexico cannot help because of truce in the next war and Add Wargoal Take Mexico From Sphere of Influence and then youre good. gt gt I dont remember exactly when you have to take more Caribbean islands from European powers but just do it its pretty easy. Once you meet the requirements youll get another decision to Integrate the FRCA. This is the easy part where you start making inroads into Central and South America. Again dont be afraid to beat up on European powers its a logistical nightmare for them to protect their American holdings.gt gt Oh and in terms of allies try to get the German Empire or the Russian Empire on your side because youll be attacking most other powers haha.gt gt Economics is a bit tricky early on in the game. Try not to raise tariffs too much youll hurt your artisans and starve your nascent factories of RGOs. You may have to lower your military or admin sliders temporarily but I wouldnt compromise on literacy.gt In terms of parties the Socialist Party for the CSA Brothers of the Revolution is really beast it is Pro Military Full Citizenship and State Capitalism and it is perfect for the CSA. If you dont like it Fascist Party is always great but it comes late in the game. Communist Party comes a bit earlier. gt Do all these things and you will fulfill the plan of the Knights of the Golden Circle thus creating a massive CSA that stretches from Virginia to Venezuela. And then your empire can defeat any foe it comes across.gt gt Well I hope this helps.  The CSA is probably one of the more challenging but most rewarding nations you can play in Vic.gt gt gt gt In Vanilla you can only puppetize small enough nations so you should just ignore Mexico there. But in Vickymod I believe they buffed Make Puppet so it costs a bit less Infamy and you can puppet anyone.,victoria2,csmuek7,14,t5_2uadi

Romanticism allows you to gain cores on the western states. move all of your troops to the texas border. increase your opinion with the UK as often as you can  when their opinion is over  with you they wont try to sphere or ally mexicoYou can start gaining influence in mexico but dont add them to your sphere. this is just a precaution to negate any influence the UK tries to gain. ,victoria2,ctvcz0u,3,t5_2uadi

5370358,0,t3_3okoc1,Try to have  intellectuals in your largest states for maximum literacy gain allowing you to industrialise faster. It will also get you up to  global intellectuals much faster for the RP gain its difficult to get  in every state of Russia because of the bad admin efficiency. As someone else said use your NFs and keep education budget maxed. You can also stop taxing the middle class and raise taxes to max on the  rich encouraging them to promote or demote to intellectualsbeauraucrats.You can also try deliberately raising militancy to pass a few social reforms early. Every year change your government and raise taxes and tarrifs through the roof. The plus side is you can spend all that cash on railways and factories. Getting some war exhaustion really helps but try not to go over  or it starts to really hurt income.Depends how many reactionaries you have but with no socialists you usually need either  or  average militancy for social reforms. ,victoria2,cvy4gm3,2,t5_2uadi

You need to continue the war and only offer them peace when you can make them a puppet via war goal i.e. a regular war.
