784096,0,t3_22woei,Select your top layer on the right.  Then go to File gt Place... and select your upvote template.After this you must manually selectdeselect each frame that you want the upvote visible in as well as position.  If you want it to change shape or size etc you need a new layer for each orientation.Its a bit of a pain in the ass but it can be done.  Ive only used PS for all my gifs.,Makemeagif,cgteluo,2,t5_2v4na

6105174,0,t1_cyh5e5s,From your postgt The regular nsfw is from  to .From uMediocreGimpgt Are you asking for  minutes and  seconds of GIF for the short one?In other words what he is saying is asking for a  GIF is absolutely absurd.The average video is . FPS. A  GIF made from a . FPS video would have . frames in it.And thats at a minimum.A  GIF made from a  FPS video would have  frames in it and made from a  FPS video it would have  frames in it.The size of the GIF would be insane. Not to mention most programs like Photoshop and GIMP will give you errors trying to save a GIF just over MBs. gfycat wont even let you upload anything over  or a certain size restraint and uploading it to imgur would take longer than you could imagine.And thats if you know how to bypass the Photoshop  frame size limit for GIFs.,Makemeagif,cyjlgpy,2,t5_2v4na
