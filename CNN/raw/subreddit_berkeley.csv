393888,0,t3_1ylho2,UC only accepts junior transfers.  Apply at the start Novemberish of your sophomore year.  You need  credits completed before the fall you transfer.Coursework plays a big role in admissions.  For EECS prereqs are tricky.  Math physics etc. are easy to take and transfer make sure you get all those covered assist.org is a good cheat sheet.  CSA CSC CS and EEN are pretty hard to find so theres a good chance those wont articulate and youll get stuck retaking them.  B and EE you might have better luck with theyre a bit more standard.  Basically you should try to complete all the lower div coursework for the major and GE requirements if you can.  Prereqs matter a lot.GPAs a big factor...  . probably doesnt look too good but I guess thats just from one semester so itll be up after Fall next year right?The other important thing is to be interesting...  have good ECs and all that.  Pet projects are great hackathons techy jobs whatever.  Show that you like what youre doing.As for whether or not youll get in...  admissions are a toss up.  EECS is really competitive and being OOS makes it harder.  Im not sure how LampS admissions measure up right now...  remember that there are two CS programs but you can only apply to one of them.

As you said yourself you have to market your message in a conciliatory and convincing way so that other people buy into your views and I greatly appreciate how much your reply attempts to be thorough and argumentative without the use of harsh hateful language. That being said I dont contest your point that CalSERVEs language may also be excessively aggressive but I see no reason and benefit to retaliating in a similar manner since it only seems to alienate those you seek to persuade. You bring up several points with clear examples of why CalSERVE is overbearingly radical and I now think its definitely worth looking into. I dont blindly believe in accusations without doing my own research into the debate but what youve brought up is certainly worth investigating for anybody interested in voting in the upcoming election. tldr I believe youve successfully shown me and a lot of other people reading this thread why inflammatory rhetoric is ultimately ineffective and counterproductive. Thank you for sharing your wellarticulated reasons why people shouldnt vote for CalSERVE. ,berkeley,cgiji9d,18,t5_2qh9w

728396,0,t3_22i34b,. I doubt shell absolutely need to be present for the viewings although her being there would probably help some. The only exception is if the landlord only owns a few properties andor lives on the property in which case he or she will almost certainly want to at least meet her so they can confirm shed at least be a decent tenantneighbor. Either way you WILL need to have her come over when you eventually read over and sign the lease. On a side note girls tend to be a lot more perceptive about tiny but seriously important things that we men dont really consider until its too late. Having her judgment when youre going around looking for a place might really save you.. Im pretty sure her father can just email you a signed and filled out cosigner form no problem. Youll also usually be asked to submit a Proof of Employment form so have that prepared as well. And yes you should always bring copies of each whenever you go to an open house. Finally ALWAYS bring a check and KNOW HOW TO FILL IT OUT. Youll find that as we get closer to summer open houses will amount to a who can throw their money at the landlord first game. Usually Im against impulsively renting a place without thinking about it and weighing my options for a while but competition is FIERCE around here this time of year so you may or may not have a choice.. Typically large property companies like Premium Properties will have some forms you can fill out in advance but theyll always bring some to the open house to fill out too. Independent landlords may or may not have application forms available online but if they do definitely fill them out in advance. Just dont put down your social security number until youre guaranteed the place. Dont worry they usually dont mind. If the application is only available at the open house most of the time its in your best interest to arrive early. The reason is that these things tend to be on a firstcome firstserve basis after an initial screening of really terrible potential tenants. And again Id suggest persuading your girlfriend to come along but simply applying probably wont require her to be there.I can see that youre pretty new to this so heres my recommendation on how to proceed. Stalk Craigslist and similar sites several times everyday sending emails of interest out to pretty much anything that looks worthwhile to look at. The largest number of open houses tend to be over the weekend so Friday is an important day for this. HOWEVER if you can manage to open up your schedule for a weekday open house this is a great idea because the number of other people who show up will be significantly less.. Walk andor drive around the neighborhoods youre interested in once a week looking for stray ForRent signs. Not all landlords use Craigslist so you might get lucky and find a relatively unknown gem of a place if youre persistent.. DONT PANIC ABOUT HOMELESSNESS OVER THE SUMMER! There are SOO MANY people subletting over the summer that in the event that you cant find a place by MayJune you can easily find a cheap sublet for a few months while you search for permanent housing. Read about Everest Properties and then avoid them like measles. . Write up a list of priorities that youre looking for in your housing size proximity to campus pets sound level etc and decide what you can and cant go without. Chances are youll have to compromise somewhere and thisll help when the time comes.Also this is a bit personal but before you decide to move in with your girlfriend really think about how this can affect your relationship. From my experience it can be really great if youre willing to put in the constant effort but a lot of people complain about the relationship getting less intimate over time especially if theyre ALWAYS together. Meanwhile the stress of college and living on your own for the first time can really cause some strife if youre not careful. My best advice is to make sure you both have your own friends and activities so youre not too stressed and you dont end up smothering each other. Definitely make time for her and treat her well but remember that a little distance can make the moments of intimacy that much better. Also if you dont already know how to learn to cook. Trust me shell appreciate this.Finally if youre still anxious andor confused after reading all this you might want to read this post I wrote up about renting a few months ago  Its hella long but the list at the end gives you a good idea of what to look foravoid when youre looking for your place. Good luck!,berkeley,cgn2lxq,5,t5_2qh9w
729488,0,t3_22ikiv,In my personal experience as an English major with an awesome job at a coveted tech company and as someone who has hired multiple UCB undergrads these days you cant expect to get an undergrad degree and nothing else and immediately step into a great job. Theres a ton of people with an undergrad degree so you have to show what else you can bring to the table. For me I got involved with the Daily Cal because journalism interested me but I worked on the business side because I wanted more experience there. I worked a lot of random jobs throughout undergrad  personal assistant for a blind man temp data entry temp worker at the student store freelancing transcription receptionist at a law firm. I went abroad postgraduation to teach English for a year. Came back to the US and applied to  jobs mostly at nonprofits and got hired in an entrylevel customer support position at a small tech company and worked my way up to  in the company by the time I left.Ive hired for entrylevel positions in my company but wanted some work experience too meaning I wanted to see that the new grad had at least some job experience in college whether doing seasonal work part time retail work etc.Takeaways  be open to jobs outside what you think you want to do.  If a job says entry level but asks for experience apply anyway.  Dont get discouraged if you get rejected multiple times.  Take pride in whatever youre doing  one of my temp data entry jobs became a full time job in something much better and at one of my previous jobs wed often hire our temp data entry people if they showed initiative and good work ethic.  Going abroad is a great way of distinguishing yourself in the applicationinterview process if youre interested in that.,berkeley,cgn731z,10,t5_2qh9w

By end we blazed through the textbook as well in order to stay on track and that only made things seem worse. Overall there have also been a significant amount of grievances in the class regarding the professors methods and style so I suspect this post is a sort of culmination of grief. So yeah its pretty whiny but its also pretty relatable.That being said after the first midterm which I got wrecked on I basically resigned to not bother attempting the longer questions on the test.

Im not out of options for letters of rec I could get one from my boss at my internship and I was in a professors research group although I didnt interact with him much I was assisting a grad student and I did talk to a professor almost daily last semester in office hours  advising i hope  he has not forgotten me over the summer. I would just have liked stronger relationships but perhaps it is too late. How well do you have to know a professor? If no good results ever came from that research position would a professor still feel comfortable writing one? I dont think I could bring myself to put a comfy job on hold for a couple years and go back to school and concurrent schoolwork sounds very difficult which is why Id like to do it straight after undergrad. Thanks for your advice I know there are options out there but I am hesitant to take them.Sorry for so many questions but it seems like industryoriented masters programs dont really have a thesis component? They usually have a project of some sort but the thesis part is mostly found in the researchfocused masters. I think having some kind of thesis experience is a huge bonus for circuit design but is it discouraged to stop after a research masters? ,berkeley,cjbq0oh,1,t5_2qh9w

1966355,0,t3_2gua6f,Hey there! Im currently in a similar situation and I know a friend who wanted to switch from LampS to CED. So I started off as polisci major in LampS but basically fell in love with urban planningstudies in CED so now Im considering a few options keeping polisci and minor in city planning keeping polisci AND urban planningstudies simultaneous degree or switching to CED for urban studies. The thing about double majoring in an LampS major and CED major is that you have to finish prereqsbreadth in BOTH colleges which can pose a trouble for people like me whos already a junior and want to graduate on time. So just like how youre worried about that I think the best route for me so far is to stay in my LampS major Im  classes away from completing polisci anyway and finish the CED minor in city planning.On to my friend she started as poliscicity planning minor too but has recently decided to do the simultaneous degree thing that I have given up on. The reason she gave me for doing that is interesting though. She said that transferring from LampS to CED is harder than pursuing a simultaneous degree in both. Why is that the case Im not too sure. Anyway hope this can be of help to you somehow. The compromise for me to stay with polisci major with the planning minor is that Im thinking of doing the GIS minor on the side which is more valuable than a urban studies diploma imo.Also an important thing to note is that you can only have like two classes overlapping the two majors. Yes you can petition the colleges to use a class for a majors but you still can only use  in both majors. In any case they want you to take separate classes for the two collegesmajors which suck imo.One last thing to note is that urban planning at Cal is honestly not very studiodesigncentric so this might not be the answer youre looking for. But message me if you want to know more about the garbled mess that is Berkeley bureaucracy and Ill try to help you! ,berkeley,ckq5axe,1,t5_2qh9w

On a related note is there any criticism more useless than overrated especially when it is made as it is in this case without consideration for why the thing in question was rated so well to begin with? Overrated can be applied to virtually anything and says nothing. It doesnt name any specific shortcomings that can be debated to reach a better understanding. It only says this thing that everyone thinks is good I think is bad.I dont think stupid ideas should be censored nor does justice Holmes argue in favor of the censorship of stupid ideas. I probably didnt convey my point well. I meant only to refute what I thought was an extremely weak argument made by Chris Hitchensthat opinions automatically gain importance when they are held by a few individuals. The point of free speech is not to provide shelter to incontrovertibly stupid ideas that fail to get themselves accepted but to ensure a free market of competing ideas that encompasses all ideas. Hitchens defends the Holocaust denier against censorship by assigning to him some kind of mystical importance. Holmes defends the Holocaust denier against censorship by saying there is no need to silence him.The right to free speech does not interfere with social consequences that might result from that speech. Withdrawing an invitation to speak at an event as a result of student protest is a social consequence and wouldnt constitute an infringement on the right to free speech.

My issue with it is that she never lowered the initial exorbitant increase after receiving funding from the state defending it with the argument of quality education means quality funding thats how it was presented on the website.

She had to tutor SAT prep for three years before getting a probation position where shell be fired at the end of the school year and rehired next fall if the position is still open and hasnt been taken by a more senior teacher.Was it hard becoming friends with other teachers? My sister said the other teachers are mostly  years older than she is and already have families.She also finds it to be a lot of work as a firstyear teacher. She spends a long time creating lesson plans and feels underpaid. She says she gets paid more per hour as a tutor than as a teacher.

They often just need you to say the words and even then they will still file a report with Student Conduct. . If you somehow didnt cheat and were flagged you need to explain how you had similar code or test answers.  This is usually solved by whether or not you were sitting next to a person you can prove youve never met them had contact etc.  Honestly the chances of being flagged and have not cheated in some respect is like . but regardless just be honest.  Regardless and this applies to everyone on this sub if youve cheated JUST COME FORWARD.  I know that TAs Profs and the entire staff will be so much more forgiving if you just admit your fault.  Just say youre incredibly sorry and ashamed and while you may see a serious grade penalty in the order of a letter grade its a MILLION times better than getting a letter to Student Conduct and potentially expelled. You want forgiveness and not pissing off TAs even further who want nothing more than to be done with your case.Edit Just wanted to clarify something. The worst possible scenario you can be under is that you are accused of cheating YOU KNOW YOUVE CHEATED and still try to deny it will really bullshit arguments like It must be a coincidence Ive never even TALKED to people about this project etc. etc.  This will cause you to be smited in the worst possible way. Dont be that guy or gal. Best Possible scenario? You right now with this email in your mailbox makes you realize Fuck Im caught. You immediately email Prof. Hug with Title Incredibly Ashamed and Sorry and you write the best apology letter you can muster.

I am holding onto my lease for dear life but I have major sympathy for anyone who has to move. First year graduate students are really effed since they are operating an very limited budgets. Theres not even enough housing for all the students and now huge parts of the market are being bought up by SVSF people to commute from nonresident Chinese investors or Airbnb conversions.And its unsolvable ... The city could ban Airbnb but thats shitty overregulation. More housing could be built but that will take years and only leaves poorly designed and abysmally suited apartments and at rates equal to SVSF. I dont remember which development it was one a little ways down University but all the brbaoffice units it it had the bathroom attached to the master so the nd bedroom resident had to go through the first bedroom. Berkeley property owners have no incentive to rebuild their softstory ratboxes into something better and the city comes at you hard with their hand out if you are doing any sort of residential building. The school could admit less students but we know thats not going to happen.edit Oh it looks like the Chinese economy is crashing.

I wish we couldve worked on more tbh. The topics were cool but since we didnt work on them Ive forgotten about it. I dont regret taking the class I just feel like it left a lot to be desired. But a lot of people went around that by doing all sorts of cool extra things especially in the ray tracer assignment which was my favorite. It is programmingbased. The math is matrices and some linear algebra. Lots of formulas. Workload is fine.

I have only gotten As and As in the other CS classes Ive taken admittedly only  and  for upperdivs. This is because I just didnt get basic concepts like environment diagrams moreover I hated doing them. a spends a lot of time teaching you how to code and how to understand what code is doing which on a lowlevel was very difficult for me to understand. However when I got to data structures discrete math and algorithms it was a lot easier for me to solve problems since everything seemed much more intuitive. Coding is still my least favorite part of CS. So I guess my point is depending on your interests and what youre good at it may get easier or harder from here.

I wasnt there when the tear gassing happened however so I cant speak on that.In my time there were only very large protests maybe once or twice a year and they were hardly disruptive  just avoid main thoroughfares if you dont want to deal with the large groups of people I did that even when their werent demonstrations. To me that was a bit of the excitement of going to Cal. But I understand if people arent into it.

Also and appeal to fear Also I dont give a shit about your fears. You are probably scared of being beheaded by a muzzie too but that doesnt mean that we shouldnt allow knives or muzzies in our society.gt Guns dont appear to be clearly usefulWe have plenty of things in life which are a net loss. Over the entire lifetime of the airline industry the whole industry is a net money loss. It has had a huge benefit to society overall but looking at it in terms of just expected outcome is misleading.Moreover alcohol is something that is allowed in society which has a huge negative expected value to it. It would be impossible to account for all the loss damage and woe causes by it but plenty of deaths and ruined lives directly involve alcohol. And yet we allow it because people want it to be part of their lives.So even if it is the case that allowing civilians to arm themselves in public would appear to be a net cost to society that does not mean that the idea is either incompatible with our current social practices or necessarily not a useful intervention in any given single case.gt I am complaining about this behaviour.About the behavior of people disagreeing with you and making a pertinent response to a situation that exemplifies a solvable problem?

6042406,0,t3_3y9dpw,I do ok in my cs classes although admittedly I havent taken that many yet. Heres a few of my study tips. First dont take too many classes. Ive made that mistake. Make sure youll have time to focus on those classes. Second I know its hard as hell but really try to keep up with the class. If a topic was covered more than two weeks ago max and you still dont have at least a decent understanding of it thats a problem. Ive been there where you go to lecture say What the fuck is heshe the professor talking about and just put it off. Thats a recipe for last minute cramming and shallow understanding. Go to office hours and grill your gsi in discussion if you dont understand. If you feel like that asshole who everyone just wants to shut up and stop asking questions youre probably doing it right within reason sometimes you actually are just being an asshole. Youd be amazed how many people wont ask questions because theyre too afraid odds are at least one other person is also confused. Third even if you are caught up try to go to discussion as much as possible and at least occasionally attend office hours. You may pick up tricks on doing problems faster get practice with problems you may see on the exam or get a deeper understanding. Fourth utilize old midterms to focus your studying. If you dont know how to do a problem go back and review that section. CS classes often give you cheat sheets because memorizing formulas is almost always worthless  you need to understand WHY the answer is the answer. If you understand the underlying concept you can handle curve ball questions. Fifth try not to study to collapse! This sounds a bit like a time management thing. Sometimes it might be strategic to cram all night but usually thats the result of poor planning. I know that if I say Im gonna study for the next twelve hours  hours will be spent on reddit  hours will be spent actually studying  hours will be spent bleary eyed not making much progress and  hour will be spent complaining. Then Ill spend most of the next day sleeping it off. Study in blocks where you know you can stay focused. Spread them out over dead week. Go to sleep when you feel like youre not making progress and start fresh the next day. Get sleep before the exam. This will also allow you to go to gsispiazzaprofessors with questions in a reasonable period of time rather than the night before. Sixth make friends in your class and form a study group. Not only will this help on homework projects and such but it is also good for exams as well. It might take you an hour to figure out what your friend could explain in five minutes. It is incredibly helpful to have someone there who can answer questions for you as they come up. They may not be able to answer every question but it helps and youll also review the material and discover gaps in your knowledge by teaching them. Plus you make friends.Hope those help. ,berkeley,cybo35v,8,t5_2qh9w

There is also alot of research done in the most gender egalitarian societies in the world that point to women consistently pick jobs that involve interactions with people such as being a doctor versus jobs where you interact with systemswith less people like engineering jobs. Moreover these studies dont really say women are bad at math or women hate math but that in egalitarian genderequal societies they CHOOSE not to do it over other career options.The only country on earth with women in high numbers of engineering rolls is India which is far from the bastion of gender equality and whose economy is highly tech driven. But this is where the paradox  lies and becomes more interesting. The more gender equal the country the MORE gender divergences there are across a multitude of fields. Health care overwhelmingly dominated by women in countries like countries like Norway and Sweden have VERY few men and the same for engineering switched around.Edit typo,berkeley,cz125zu,6,t5_2qh9w

You do a lot of warmups and theater games as well as preparing monologues and scenes to perform in front of the class.

Dear Haas communityWe are all deeply saddened by the news that one of our students has lost his life in the July  attack in Nice. Nick Leslie studied at the College of Natural Resources and was enrolled to join the Haas Undergraduate Program this fall as a dual major. This summer Nick had been studying entrepreneurship in France as part of the Study Abroad program. Our thoughts go out to Nicks family his friends classmates instructors staff and all who knew him. Please join me in sending them our heartfelt condolences.The senseless violence that is gripping our communities is a sad reminder how important it is to hold our friends and our communities close and to support one another. The ASUC student leadership is coordinating a vigil in remembrance of Nick and his legacy at UC Berkeley scheduled for today July  at  in Sproul Plaza. I encourage you to attend. Supervisors please understand and plan for many of us being away from the office starting at . The Chancellors community message follows below.

Berkeley but on the whole the crime is worse than any other part of the city crime stats dont back this up because most things go unreported and even when they are reported cops dont respond unless they get multiple reports of gunfire  and even then they dont always respond.There are a lot of people who walk through my block without realizing where they are. They have their phones and wallets out thinking that they are totally safe and then they get robbed. Cars are stolen and broken into all of the time on my street and they are never in the crimeblotters. In the past few years Ive personally witnessed six shootouts and four stabbings all within two blocks of my apartment. Seeing someone walking down the street while holding something that looks like an AK is not out of the ordinary and again no one would call the police.

Im on academic probation now but as long as I pass this semester Ill still graduate ontime. My GPAs nothing to brag about but Ill be fine. i hope. i honestly think i did better on last semesters  final.Its hard to say if Ive moved on. I still struggle with the same selfconfidence and motivation issues that led to my downward spiral and I suspect I will for the rest of my life. My grades this semester are still pretty disappointing and I know I could do much better. Still its a start. Recoverys always a tough road to walk.Heres my advice to you You will be fine. Everyone fails eventually  we pick ourselves up we move on. For some it takes longer than others.If you know the mistakes you made and why you failed change them. But dont beat yourself up for making the mistakes you did  its easy to fall into a vicious cycle where you feel bad about failing then feel worse for feeling bad. Youll fail many times in the future too but youll get over them just as you will get over this.As an aside  if anyone wants  needs to talk my inbox is always open. Also if youre more concerned with the practical outcome of failing a course  e.g. effect on your grade  talking to your counselor is a good way to get things sorted out.,berkeley,db80n0m,8,t5_2qh9w

10595924,0,t1_dd8tnsa,I agree with you. Im merely explaining the underlying frustration of many protesters. The benefit of free speech isnt just hearing what others have to say but also being able to debate and argue with them. Milo on purpose mind you has fostered a personality and rhetoric that is designed to be divisive and offensive to many people. Being unable to counterargue Milo because of the structure of the speaking event is highly frustrating to many people.From a certain perspective Milos free speech by its very structure has to come at the expense of other peoples free speech. Freedom of Speech isnt merely about being allowed to voice beliefs and ideologies but also being allowed to challenge beliefs and ideologies. You ever have an older relative who spouts some bullshit to you and you want to argue with them and show them why theyre wrong or at the very least convince other people in the room why theyre wrong? But you cant do so due to family structure of authority favoring older people if you argue with them youre being rude or if youre still a child and you try and argue with them youre just told to shutup and stop talking back? Many people have experienced this at one point or another and its a frustrating experience to go through.Milo is similiar to that. Hes given a platform in which he can spew White Nationalist rhetoric virtually unchallenged. What makes it worse is that he voices his rhetoric in a way once again by design that targets numerous different groups of people and will undoubtedly anger said groups of people. Quite honestly Milo wants this to happen. He enjoys having his events canceled because it allows him to push the Regressive left censoring me narrative that has resulted in him being as popular and notorious as he is now. If Milo wanted to voice his beliefs and arguments and not have massive waves of protesters at every event he could easy just tone down his divisive and antagonistic rhetoric and stop trying to bait people into getting angry.But he wont because most of his appeal and fame is based on how he makes other people upset with him. Once you tone down the trolling tactics he uses he stops being an edgy and controversial public speaker and he now ends up being just another misinformed White Nationalist. His appeal is highly reliant on him being needlessly offensive. Without that he simply doesnt have enough appeal to be relevant. He isnt particularly funny interesting or insightful. He covers up his lack of genuine interesting ideas and unique perspectives by essentially turning himself into a topic of free speech.,berkeley,dd8vz92,1,t5_2qh9w

11388751,0,t3_62iiw5,Hey congrats on getting in! Im currently a junior in the chemical engineering program here. Ill try to answer your questions as best I can.The culture here is definitely more collaborative than cutthroat were generally not premeds vying for that A. However the classes are very difficult and curved so theres some competition to beat the average set by your classmates. A lot of us bond over the difficulty of the classes though and pretty much everyone here is friendly. As I said before the classes are pretty tough. Core classes are generally curved to a B or B average . and . respectively. Maybe around  of the class will get into the A to A range. The lower divs are the gen ed classes so physics chem math etc. These can be difficult as a lot of them are weeder courses and the material isnt so interesting. Once you get to the upper divs though the classes become a lot more interesting at least for me but are as difficult if not more. As for most chemical engineering curriculums all the core concepts like transport separations kinetics etc. are all very math and physics heavy. I would be sure to get your calculus down because youre going to need it. Research is fairly easy to get in to if you know what to do. Lots of labs here take undergraduate researchers. Im not doing research myself but a bunch of my friends arehave. The best way it seems to get into a research position is to get to know some upper classmen who do research. When they leave their spot you can ask to replace them. You can meet these people through chemE clubs like AIChE.It is definitely feasible to do a physics minor but will be a bit more work. Looking at the physics minor requirements it looks like youd have to take two extra classes physics c and A and then  units of electives roughly  courses. The rest of the required courses are covered by the chemE curriculum. If you choose the open elective program instead of a concentration you can use c to knock the science elective out. So its definitely doable but it would really help if you can AP out of some classes and maybe take summer classes. As for some other tips I would definitely try to find a group of friends to study with and help each other out with assignments. However its also important that you do a lot of the work on your own because honestly thats how you really learn. You wont have your friends to help you on an exam. Other than that you should just get ready for an intense environment. I dont know how your high school was but mine did not prepare me at all for the level of work at Berkeley and it took a couple of semesters to get up to speed with the pace. Its a challenging but also very rewarding and fun experience. Enjoy it while you can because it goes by fast.,berkeley,dfmw9tr,4,t5_2qh9w

This is mostly because the  series uses much more advanced math than the  series. For instance I took A last semester and we were basically working with vector calculus day . My roommates are taking A right now and they didnt use any calculus at all until halfway in the semester. I recommend you take Math  multivariable calculus concurrently with A to help mitigate the learning curve. I did  with B and found that most of  I had early learned while struggling through my physics psets. Id also recommend being familiar with first and second order differential equations homogeneous or otherwise. If you are familiar with the math beforehand you will have a much easier time understanding the physical relationships behind the math in the  series.,berkeley,dguoou1,3,t5_2qh9w
