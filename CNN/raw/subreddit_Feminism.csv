15713,0,t3_1u80im,I know this is not the main point of the article but this portion of the quote from the article bothered megtAt another point an unidentified boy asks What if that was your daughter? Nodianos responds But she isnt.gtgtNodianoss words are telling because for too long weve been teaching our sons to think of the consequences of rape within a familial context i.e. Imagine if it were your wifedaughtermother and its clear that this method of education is a complete and total failure. Boys shouldnt be taught that only women to whom they are genetically bound are worthy of being treated as human beings because in part that implies those who are not family are subhuman and therefore deserving of their own victimization.Who is the we here that is doing this absolutely shitty education?  When did we teach boys that only women to whom they are genetically bound should be treated as human beings.  This kind of sloppy thinking is far too common in debates involving the effects of societal customs and norms on peoples behavior.  When did we teach people that the only way to discuss issues surrounding racegenderetc. is to uncritically attach the label we or society to an extremely exaggerated moral strawman which is a pure invention and in no way resembles reality?And since the article uses anecdotal evidence exclusively let me just say that I have never once in my life been told to imagine if it were my wifedaughtermother although I have sometimes asked women to imagine if it were your husbandsonfather.  So maybe I should write an article about how women lack empathy and ask why society teaches them that only men who are biologically or personally linked to them are the only men of any value.In all seriousness now the reason why people are asked to imagine that the person being harmed is a relativeclose friend in order to evince empathy is that people naturally have more empathy for the people they are close to in their life.  And indeed the whole point of saying this is to point out that other nonrelatives also deserve the same respect and love as one gives to a relative or close friend and so the point of this practice is precisely to drive home the opposite of what the above quote claims we supposedly teach our young boys about valuing women.At the same time as a supporter of say affirmative action can attest it is extremely annoying to be asked to reconsider ones opinion about an issue one has thought long and hard about by being told to imagine it was your relative who is negatively affected because it implies that your position is one lacking in empathy.  It is actually a subtle form of insult.  So yes its a dick move and should be reserved only for people who are actually being dicks and saying terrible things.,Feminism,ceg81ev,3,t5_2qr7i
17147,0,t3_1ualut,Advice is to go to class and I reckon your uneasiness will disappear. I also attended a module called introduction to feminism when I was in University. I cant remember precisely but there were about  women and  men in the class. The professor running the class was a man.From what I can remember nobody treated or spoke to the men any differently than they did the women so I dont think you will be picked on if thats what youre worried about. Then again the particular men in my class were intelligent and friendly and made some really interesting contributions. Nobody will expect you to speak on behalf of all men just like you wouldnt expect a woman to speak on behalf of all women. Conversely it would be a bad idea if you were to presume to speak for all men. Of course people can get pretty passionate in political classes but from my experience people reacted to each other on the basis of each others arguments rather than each others gender. You wouldnt really expect it to be any other way given the context. If someone in the class was to treat someone else in the class differently due to their gender it would probably get picked up and discussed as a class. People might say some stuff you dont agree with and sometimes people might not agree with stuff that you say but personally I really enjoyed the chance to have those kind of conversations. I expect nobody will be out to get you and everybody will just want to learn. If only the rest of the world was as mindful.,Feminism,cegdwal,8,t5_2qr7i

50571,0,t1_cek6rit,Excerpt from linked Wikipedia article about Dunbarampamps number  gtDunbars number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person. This number was first proposed by British anthropologist Robin Dunbar who found a correlation between primate brain size and average social group size. By using the average human brain size and extrapolating from the results of primates he proposed that humans can only comfortably maintain  stable relationships. Proponents assert that numbers larger than this generally require more restrictive rules laws and enforced norms to maintain a stable cohesive group. It has been proposed to lie between  and  with a commonly used value of . Dunbars number states the number of people one knows and keeps social contact with and it does not include the number of people known personally with a ceased social relationship nor people just generally known with a lack of persistent social relationship a number which might be much higher and likely depends on longterm memory size. about | amp autodeletes if comment score  or less. | amp mistake? uRuefully can trigger deletion by replying remove.,Feminism,cek6rrx,1,t5_2qr7i

66910,0,t1_cem1lu2,Some quotes from that materialgtThere is now an important critical literature on the representations of women in the media and western art. John Bergers book Ways of Seeing provides an accessible introduction and Laura Mulveys famous essay on the male gaze launched an important literature in the field of cinema. And theres a fine review essay by Paul Messaris available on the web. But Erving Goffmans somewhat lesserknown study called Gender Advertisements is useful here because he focused on among other things poses common to magazine advertisements. Commercial photographs Goffman points out involve carefully performed poses presented in the style of being only natural.gtFor example women are pictured more often than men in what Goffman calls the recumbent position... one from which physical defense of oneself can least well be initiated and therefore one which renders one very dependent on the benignness of the surround...Floors also are associated with the less clean less pure less exalted parts of a roomfor example the place to keep dogs p.  gtGoffman also points out that women are often posed bending their heads or bodies at an angle I.e. cant. The effect of cant he says is that the level of the head is lowered relative to that of others including indirectly the viewer of the picture. The resulting configurations can be read as an acceptance of subordination an expression of integration submissiveness and appeasement. p.  gtCant is often combined with putting a finger in the mouth or otherwise touching the face in a childlike way. gtThese poses have become so common in advertising that we hardly notice them. gtWhen looked at closely though they look strange almost kabukilike in their formality. gtThese pictures remember are from womens magazines. They are not for men to look at. So why are there all these poses for women that suggest deference childishness subordination and helplessness? gtTo understand the meaning of these images as viewed by women look carefully at the way this model looks at you the viewer. Theres something knowing about it as if she is saying I know you are looking at me. I am in control of your gaze. The knowing look belies the otherwise childlike pose. gtThis ad makes the logic explicit. As University of Vermont student Hannah Gregory described this ad the model is looking away as if unaware of her beauty and the power of her allure  but only as if. The background closeup image of her eyes Gregory writes seem to look into me and connect with a desire that Ive hidden away and ultimately hate to admit to the fact that Id like to have the furtive glances and subtle stares that men place on her their desire that she can grasp control of. And she knows this. She knows that she perches in the seductive relaxed way that draws the eyes of men her way and she knows that I want to be her. So she looks at me she talks to me and tells me that I have the capacity to be her that she is me. gtWhat is going on in a typical fashion ad then is not that the viewer is looking at a woman who is actually subordinate or childish. Rather the models are posed so as to show that they know that they are being looked at  belying the otherwise childlike pose  and they are controlling or mastering this act of being looked at. The childish submissive postures are represented as strategic as a sign of control of the gaze. gtWhen an accomplished successful woman poses in this way then she is not at all signaling to others that she is actually subordinate. On the contrary on the surface she is showing that she too can be successful in this arena the arena where the goal is to attract and control the power of the gaze by striking a subordinate pose. And were this an occasional event if we regularly saw images of women that were of a different sort the effect might be innocuous. gtThe problem is however that most women make less money and have less power than most men and the message that goes out to women without power is that to get some you need to gain control of a male view of women  which means to get power through male power rather than on your own.gtThis is where the theory of the male gaze becomes important. John Berger once noted Men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. Ways of Seeing  p.  gtThere is a long tradition in Western art of representing men as viewers and women as viewed. It continues in modern advertising . . . gt Women watch themselves being looked at. Women are acculturated to look at themselves through the eyes of an imagined man because the ideal spectator is always assumed to be male. As a result Female models in ads addressed to women treat the lens as a substitute for the eye of an imaginary male onlooker Paul Messaris. gtAdvertisers have long understood this and sought to exploit it. This  ad was directed not at women but at potential purchasers of advertising in Redbook. A womans hats the copy reads are not bought to keep the rain off nor ... to please the woman. They are bought for people to look at. And people usually means men. So back of her when she buys stands the shadow of a man ready to help or hinder the sale. gtThis WW IIera  ad for soap invokes the notion of a male gaze rather obviously. The female viewer of this ad is asked to imagine herself as being looked at by an almost literal army of men. The unfocussed upward glance of the woman is the expression of someone who is not looking at anything but is rather engaged in the act of being looked at. gtAdvertisers are still quite conscious of the general phenomenon. This picture is from an ad for Vogues new web site designed to bring the magazines readers into Vogues version of the hightech digital environment. The theme of the series of ads is runways are everywhere. The images invite women to imagine themselves as if they were on fashion runways being viewed in the most ordinary of places like laundromats and alleyways. Everywhere you go the ad tells women you are on view. gtWhen women look at these ads they are encouraged to see themselves as a man might see them. Such ads as Paul Messaris puts it appear to imply a male point of view even though the intended viewer is often a woman. So the women who look at these ads are being invited to identify both with the person being viewed and with an implicit oppositesex viewer. gtEven the tony New York Times fashion supplement happily reproduces this logic. This image graced the cover of the spring  issue. It shows a woman striking a pose smiling at the camera in that way that suggests she knows and is in control of this moment of being on view. Just to make the point clear an older portly man is posed next to her covering his face. The editors undoubtedly were proud of the humor irony and retro quality here the man seems embarrassed and the woman triumphant and the whole scene nostalgic and carefully historical because the small print tells us this is two models pretending to be  posing as  Charles Chaplin and his young wife from the s. Cleverness and historic references do not however change the fact that its still the same hoary clich. The question of who has power and wealth and how this woman is gaining access to it needs not be asked women get power from men by using their looks. gtThe problem with this tradition of representation its worth emphasizing is not that its wrong for women to want to be attractive or sexy or that admiring beauty is somehow shallow or immoral. Rather the problem is how beauty is being defined as a means to male power through strategic deference. Its not simply sex or sexiness thats at stake here but a particular construction of sexiness in terms of a power relation of male dominance and female subordination. And its a kind of thinking about sexuality and human relations that in the long run can cause us all trouble.gtThe male gaze is not only a trick perpetrated on hapless women by manipulative men. It has become part of the structures of feeling of our day and age and as such it interferes with both mens and womens psychological health and our ability to have mutually fulfilling relationships with one another. Sue Brideshead the fictional heroine of Thomas Hardys Jude the Obscure speaks of an inborn craving which undermines some womens morals almost more than unbridled passion the craving to attract and captivate  a craving to which she attributes some of the shortcomings of her life and relationships. Hardy created her in  when the consumer culture was in its earliest stages and women were just beginning to feel modest new freedoms to move about see and be seen in the world. And he arguably was insensitive to the role of patriarchy in all this if power between men and women were equal women would probably be less inclined to seek fulfillment in the attraction of men. But the omnipresence of images like the preceding in our culture for a century now almost certainly helps cultivate the craving to attract and captivate among women and to the extent that women get caught up in that craving they are less likely to seek satisfaction and rewards in their own accomplishments and in mutually respectful supportive relationships with men and others around them.,Feminism,cem1q1w,1,t5_2qr7i

120276,0,t3_1vgtnc,Hm. At least for the time being I think the matter should be settled purely on practical grounds  any such ban is unenforceable and would only bring prejudice to women especially women from more disadvantaged backgrounds.The stated aim of this legislation is to ban sexselective abortions but its effects will only be to limit womens decision making capabilities and criminalize health providers NOW said in a statement.Race and SexSelective Abortion BansConservative lawmakers are increasingly turning to seemingly innocuous bans on race and sexselective abortion in the effort to restrict womens access to reproductive healthcare. Evidence suggests that the actual incidence of race and sexselective abortions in the U.S. is minimal. In practice these laws do nothing to combat actual discrimination but instead serve as one more barrier to access especially for minority women.In  Arizona became the first state to ban race and sexselective abortions.  The law made it a felony to knowingly perform or finance an abortion sought due to the race or sex of the fetus.  A federal ban  Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act PRENDA  has also been proposed but it failed to pass in the House.The ACLU is currently suing over the Arizona law arguing that it creates an unconstitutional interference with a womans right to choose and that it requires doctors to engage in racial profiling and discrimination.  A major concern is that AsianAmerican women will be profiled and discriminated against in seeking abortion care due to stereotypes that such women would be more likely to seek abortions of female fetuses.Advocates are also concerned that AfricanAmerican women will face discrimination and incorrect assumptions about their motivations for seeking abortions. Higher rates of abortion among AfricanAmerican women have led conservatives to claim that raceselective abortion is a widespread problem and even to allege that abortion rights advocates are perpetrating a genocide against African Americans. These claims are not only false they are insulting to women making private personal choices about abortion.These laws are dangerous to women of color and immigrants as they place yet another barrier in the way of accessing safe reproductive healthcare. Women may be deterred from seeking care if they fear discrimination refusal of service or criminal liability. These bans are virtually impossible to enforce they only make it more difficult for vulnerable women to access care while doing nothing to achieve the stated goal.,Feminism,ces4krw,3,t5_2qr7i

389786,0,t1_cfl2x6e,You know instead of just telling people theyre wrong and that they clearly have no idea what the MRM is you could offer evidence to the contrary.All of my personal experiences with selfdescribed MRAs have been negative. Theyve told me that women dont experience sexism anymore  we can vote now what more do we want? theyve told me that false rape accusations are a bigger problem than actual rape theyve denied the existence of power structures that benefit men over women theyve argued for their right to use gendered slurs theyve attempted to argue that traditional gender roles are biologically ingrained and theyve continued to parrot the same flawed arguments over and over.I would fucking love to hear what you guys have been doing for men. Seriously. MRAs always say they want more fathers to get custody in divorce cases. What have you done to further that goal? And are you aware that when men ask for custody theyre usually granted it? A large part of the problem is that fathers dont seek custody in the first place either because theyve accepted the societal idea that mothers are more suited to care for children or because theyre convinced they wont get it.MRAs always say that male rape victims are underreported and overlooked. I agree! What have you done to help those victims? Do you point out rape jokes that make light of male rape? Have you taken part in any awareness campaigns? Are there any MRA groups who have made it their goal to provide assistance to male victims?The biggest conflict comes from the fact that while feminists have academic works to fall back on and a long history of real activist work the MRM has very little to its name. A Voice for Men is one of the most wellknown MRA websites yet it routinely publishes some of the vilest misogynyfueled antifeminist articles Ive ever read. The biggest activist movement that Ive seen from the MRM was when rMensRights decided to spam Occidental College with false rape reports. You can argue that it was only a few MRAs out of thousands but what are we supposed to think when we have so few examples of real activism from MRAs? When the only evidence of activism beyond discussion in rMensRights is antifeminist and harmful in nature of course people see the movement as reactionary and regressive.Pleas. Prove me wrong. Show me the helpful things that MRAs are doing for men. For bonus points do it without bashing feminists or feminism as a whole.,Feminism,cfl6108,3,t5_2qr7i

655505,0,t1_cgeripl,Oh believe me Im not an MRA. Ive been downvoted on this very sub for being too harsh on MRAs.But when the singlemostpopular argument Ive ever seen for the wrongness of victimblaming is the argument that rape is the only crime for which we ask the victims what they did to cause the crime or say they brought it on themselves well...I mean if I leave my laptop on a park bench when I go inside to pee everybody will say Well fuck you might as well have left a Take Me Free Laptop sign on it! and Jesus you were basically asking a thief to take it we have to be able to recognize that victimblaming happens outside of sexual crimes.I mean for fucks sake Trayvon Martin was de facto put on trial for his own fucking murder.We victimblame for lots of shit. And its wrong then. And its more pronounced for sexual violence. Im not one of those MRAs saying rapes not a big deal but it fucking bothers me when other feminists blatantly and unrepentently LIE about the nature of victimblaming like that.I feel like the movement sacrifices integrity in its fight against MRAs. Ive seen feminists say rape is a gendered issue that men cant possibly understand. As a male victim of attempted rape I take personal affront when Tumblr feminists say men cant understand what that feels like or that men cant experience it at all or...Maybe my experiences are unusual. Im willing to admit that theyre unorthodox...but nearly every feminist Tumblr post Ive ever read has flatout denied experiences I have personally been through and I resent it deeply. Why? Because this is a movement I try to support because it stands for giving voice to everybody and denying the experiences of noone...but sometimes I feel boxed out. And my friends in whatever your local college calls Womens Studies. Ours calls it Women Gender and Sexuality Studies WGSS pronounced WIGS for short all tell me that Im trying to muscle a cishet white mans views into feminism to keep women from having a voice even when they know that what theyre reblogging on Tumblr is explicitly denying the experiences of others...It starts to feel like my friends are saying things that they know arent true because theyre told that its what feminism tells them. Well Im a feminist a man a victim of domestic assault a victim of domestic abuse a victim of attempted rape a sufferer of PTSD because of those things and Im really tired of reading blogs that tell me that men cant understand the fear of walking home in the dark that men cant understand the fear of rape that men cant understand the reality of living in fear of ones significant other that men dont know what it feels like to fear their SO...Fuck I moved halfway across the state and basically burrowed into a hobbithole for years in terror that my abuser would come to this town and find me. Its been years and even the thought of meeting her facetoface caused me to run to the bathroom and negotiate with my reflection for ten minutes to convince myself that Im secure enough to finish this comment.I dont want to detract from feminism.

This poster is about how ridiculous it is that the onus and responsibility to stop rape is put on women through these lists that are aimed at women and not at men. Its not aimed at men who might be rapists its aimed at society in general trying to change this norm. It doesnt need to convince anyone not to rape or that rape really is a Bad Thing to DoTM . It just needs to point out that the current cultural script asks women to curtail their freedom in an unrealistic way to prevent something that isnt their fault.,Feminism,cht53hk,4,t5_2qr7i

Just because your husband nods every time you complain about people on rfeminism doesnt mean you are right. I though feminism was more about equality and rights for women who do not have them but rfeminism turned out to be a nest of bitter selfrighteous wasps that dont tolerate others opinion. Karma is a bitch and the negative attitude you help broil in that subreddit and around you will bite you back with interests.Have a jolly day lady.i have no interest in having a private conversation with you about this especially when you accuse ME of having a psychological issue. you are obviously so adept at finishing what you started and having rational communication. i did NOT say that anyONE was weird. i said its weird that rfeminism harbors such antithetical people as evidenced by odd down voting trends and comments like yours. your understanding of what feminism is if you ask me lord knows theres no consensus is only half right its about equality for women AND ALL PEOPLE. edit for good measure see an earlier comment of mine  on this thread where i expressed that id like to read about mens experiences like this.i wont pretend that im really active here or read a lot posts largely due to reasons associated with the aforementioned weirdness i see here but nothing at all of what i posted above or ever here would match your description of being a bitter selfrighteous wasps that dont tolerate others opinion that sentiment has not been my experience nor my practice. i asked you a straightforward fair question one might say to you know understand your opinion why are you here when you either dont agree with or understand or want to try to understand feminism? you deleted it and tried to make private personal attacks. youre part of the problem. nothing of what i said to you or have ever said here has exhibited or helped to broil anything negative. you on the other hand are case in point. you proved my point that people that dont align with feminism try to muck things up around here. no need to have my husband agree with me not that i ever said he did i said i talked to him about it who are you to assume he agreed?. i sincerely asked you why youre here to understand where youre coming from and you couldnt handle it. come back when youre willing to have a constructive conversation. and yes my day has been fine thank you. same to you.,Feminism,chwmx8e,13,t5_2qr7i
1144344,0,t3_271dyl,Although the film had some great feminist messages I also felt as if Disney didnt commit to the feminism as much as it could have.  In a way it was sort of fake feminism.  Maleficent was used very much as a prop in many action scenes in my opinion.  It was as if there would be a lot of action surrounding her and then a shot of her looking fierce standing then more action around her and then a shot of her looking fierce in a pose.  I dont know.  Maybe I am over thinking maybe I should be happy with the feminism this film gave us in comparison to the original Sleeping Beauty  but the film was mostly based around Angelina Jolie looking pretty and having an awesome catsuit like costume.  With that being said I loved that a prince didnt save her and the women saved each other.  I am happy that Disney is moving more in that direction in general ,Feminism,chycmlg,2,t5_2qr7i

They currently teach women martial arts as a form of self defense yet I personally do not know what style they are teaching them. WeKuros! do not provide martial arts training.We believe that the level of martial arts expertise needed to realistically fend off multiple attackers at oncewho are possibly armed with clubs or knives is relatively high. That is why we feel that pepper spray is a more realistic defensive alternative. Giving someone not only range and distance from their attackers but acting as a force multiplier if they do have to engage in a physical confrontation.

Property in itself does not imply that the owner wants to be the only one to oh god this is not sounding well use it. Also I dont see why my initial response got downvoted.

I think the games should get as close to real life as possible when it comes to this particular instance and more can be done to portray real life. Casually throwing something in a game is bad especially something so sensitive. I submit that Sleeping Dogs handled prostitution horribly.Lets look at another game Dishonored. It has a brothel level and I honestly believe that removing the brothel level entirely would be an awful idea and make the game worse. The entire theme of the game is about the rich taking advantage of the poor and the brothel level serves to further that purpose. You see many of the women being mistreated and when sneaking through their dressing room they will talk and discuss some of the patrons and their hardships. While you never outright interact with any of them its a stealth game after all there is some character development.,Feminism,ci9e3ja,3,t5_2qr7i

1519399,0,t3_2bim9x,Growing up I had so much pressure to give up my gaming interests.  Like when I tried to play magic so many of my girl friends would tell me that I shouldnt play and it was for boys.  It didnt help that a lot of the boys would say that to me too. I was always annoyed that if I ever was too public about playing games I would be told that girls dont do that.  The ironic thing though?  The girls I played with in my neighborhood all played games.  It was always fun to steal their brothers copy of Golden Eye in between epic barbie sessions.  Whenever my brother werent home and we FINALLY get the console we binged on racing games and mario.  But none of these girls would have said they played games at school.  In college I kept on finding out that these really girly girls actually where closet diablo or civilization fans.  It was like a dirty secret they could share with because I was very open about my gaming habits.It makes me sad how much social pressure there is on women not to game or to just be quiet about it.  Gaming made me very comfortable in tech and inspired me to go after a D Graphics degree and work in the gaming industry.  I always wonder what my office would look like if women where able to game freely and openly without ridicule.  If it wasnt for my family being committed raising me gender neutral and my brothers encouraging me to game when I got to highscool I wouldnt be there either.,Feminism,cj6qf31,1,t5_2qr7i

1600091,0,t3_2cikp7,I pretty much agree with your points and your general train of thought.  However since you are looking for discussion I think there is lots of room for it.gtWomen should be free to make their own choices. Prostitution and other sex work are among the available choices.This sort of proposition is something that would be extremely hard for any feminist to disagree with but I think it can be put in different terms that complicate it.  For example lets say there was a regular job that involved payment for suicide bombing or for the public severing of limbs for entertainment purposes and for whatever social reason it turned out that women were disproportionately involved in such work.  This would certainly mean that the phenomena would be important to feminism but I dont think anyone would be quick to say look women should be free to do whatever they want as long as we make the services clean legal and consensual youve got to accept that this kind of thing is just one of the available choices.I think the problem in this example is that we arent comfortable with anyone freely choosing to do something that will cause them massive harm in no small part because free choice is something of a misnomer in any market context.  Perhaps we should say anyone should be free to choose what they want without interference but even then I think this is quite a bit more complicated than simple principles allow.  Should everyone be freely to become seriously addicted to heroine?  Is freedom worthwhile in cases where it precludes itself in the future?gtIf we win at feminism we create the conditions where drastically fewer women will choose to be sex workers.gtAs I said in another reply this point seems to presume more unity in the goals of feminists than actually exists.  Yes all feminists want gender equality but that turns out to mean very different things to different people.gtNo doubt it is enjoyablefulfillingempoweringetc for some but Ill wager most would very much rather be doing something else.I think this probably has a lot more to do with contingent facts than some essential nature of sex work.  As the top post indicates in the proper context sex work can be empowering to women.  We could easily imagine a society in which sex work was respected legal and even professional in which this claim which I think is probably true in most countries today would be false.My worry is actually in this ideal world in which sex work is a valued profession that women sincerely enjoy to the same degree they would enjoy say being a doctor.  Does this make medicine and sex work essentially the same or is there something about sex work that makes it inherently more coercive andor intimate than other professions?  Also are we comfortable as feminists with a world in which what is currently often gendered exploitation is cleaned up made respectable and ungendered but still based on the same fundamental premise?gtMen come for sexual gratification and leave horny and unfulfilled.Someone brought up the good point that men ought to go to strip joints for the purpose of seeing a dance and this is the gratification they receive. That said I still think there is an argument that the clientle in this context are being exploited even as they exploit others and perhaps these exploitative relationships preclude the possibility of better relationships.  For every man who acquiresrequires sex work to fulfill his desires there is less room in the social structure for that man to attain those desires outside of a business transaction.  Is it appropriate to restrict some human relations from being subsumed into a market?  What does it say about a society centered on transaction if it turns out that we must let everything be bought and sold in order to make our support of free markets internally coherent?  What kinds of people are likely to result from a society in which all human relations become increasing transaction based?I dunno but I think it is reasonable to have deep concerns on this matter.gtIts been observed that sex work is centrally about subjugation of women whether this is the point or simply the result. Catharine MacKinnon argues that prostitution isnt sex only its you do what I say sex.  This is no good.Several responses thus far have pointed out that all work should be safe and respectable.  I agree but I do think we approach and important topic.  The trading of money for services sometimes unquestionably involves subjugation but are such transactions inherently a process of subjugation?  Ill admit that I tend to think yes despite the fact that some people in this process reject this view and express that they feel both content and empowered through it.  In response to that I would probably say that one can be content and feel empowered through subjugation so the question might be is quasivoluntary subjugation essentially... well bad?  Again I dunno though I myself would prefer not to be subjugated in any particular relationship. ,Feminism,cjguzqw,2,t5_2qr7i

Shortcomings empiricists were unable fully to address the powersaturated circumstances of diversely located knowers or to pose interpretive questions about how evidence is discursively constituted and whose evidence it suppresses in the process Standpoint theorists focus on marginalized perspectives.  Shortcomings in the absence of a unified feminism standpoint theorists cannot avoid obliterating differences. Feminist empiricism  standpoint theory and postmodern feminism  seem to reject the very possibility of dislocated unsituated knowledge epistemic individualism perspectiveless apolitical knowing and topdown positivisticempiricist methods of inquiry Dismissal of feminist epistemology in academic circles seldom adheres to the norms of research reading and reasoning. An explanation for that can be either metaepistemological a commitment to a perspective that stands above human specificity andor embodiment or subepistemological a doubt about womens capacity for reason rationality judgement objectivity clarity discrimination intellectual authorityQuotesYet when place of women blacks other nonwhite persons children slaves and servants is defined and monitored by others then conforming knowing their place can hurt and diminish women and Others from the white male norm truncating their potential for achieving wellrealized live....None of these admittedly vague requirements about epistemic responsibility can be spelled out in a checklist of rules to be followed and errors to be avoided but thinking about epistemic responsibility moves close to the realm of virtue epistemology where indeed no hard and fast rules are to be found but where virtues are social attributes realizable by emulation and aspiration in social deliberative practices where the idea of epistemological individualism recedes from centre stage and knowledgeconstruction becomes a communal interpretive and deliberative practice. ...Shifting from a perceptual topdown model of knowing to a horizontal model of knowledgemaking as a communal activity requires rethinking some of the dominant assumptions of AngloAmerican epistemology especially those about the interchangeability of knowers situations and subject matters ,Feminism,cjso29i,1,t5_2qr7i

Many will promote and create films that are misogynistic without much awareness of the problem that they are cultivating. The problem lies less with the people making the film capitalism demands you make what sells and more with people that refuse to stand up and say this is a bad film because it perpetuates negative stereotypes and ultimately is a net detriment to our cultural heritage. No narrative or fantastic character acting or even important story should come before a films cultural impact when evaluating whether it is any good or not.

The answer is to fix what makes the industry exploitative and frankly blaming the women who chose to work in the industry is entirely wrong headed.gtChoice isnt choice when its manufactured or coerced.reminds me of a discussion I had on rcatholicism on abortion and one i had on rworldnews about the burqa the fact that there are cultural factors that encourage it is not coercion. Furthermore even if it is often coerced thats a reason to prevent the coercion not to ban it so people cant freely chose. I say this because as evidence by my rcatholicism discussion the excuse of the possibility women being coerced as opposed to choosing as a reason to limit womens choices is a core tool of the patriarchy and so we CANNOT buy into that reasoning as legitimate rather we must look for ways to destroy the structures which coerce women. ,Feminism,clfzg6i,2,t5_2qr7i

Gender is informed by ideas of race class political ideology religion ethnicity and sexual orientation just as gender informs all of those discourses. Even when an issue arises specifically about women that issue is shadowed by all these other forms of power. In this sense I view feminism more as a form of critical analysis of power than specifically a womans issue. I dont think we are merely our sex. We are the nucleus of a whole range of identities and discourses that are constantly changing and interacting with each other. This doesnt mean feminists should be equalists or whatever. Certain parts of our identities take precedence in certain forms of injustice. I think it just means we should be aware that no form of powerinequality exists completely by itself.

2573210,0,t3_2p8yq6,I would absolutely agree with education being the answer to this issue.  As a personal anecdote I have had approximately zero sex education in the Canadian public school system. This occurred through my educators collective distaste for the topic in elementary and health class being a subsidiary of gym class in high school excused from class due to physical disability. Leaving me to my own devices to learn about sex resulted in the internet being my teacher.  I think Ive done fairly well for myself considering but there was a bit of a disconnect the first few times between expectations derived from porn and the reality of sex. I can definitely see the ease with which an individual could slip through the cracks or hit the wrong website first.  Two major issues weve got  Parental Supervision Its almost impossible for a parent to be in control of their kids access to the internet anymore but many make zero effort. I do believe that an internet filter can help with this. A kid generally cant be trusted on the internet alone similarly to how you shouldnt buy your  year old Grand Theft Auto and leave them to it.  Lack of Education Im probably heavily biased on this one having had no sexual education in my academic career. I dont think staff members should be able to veto the curriculum on this topic because it makes them uncomfortable as it a pretty important topic pertaining to their students health and near future.  Its also important to avoid the demonization of reasonable? fetishes sex is taboo enough as it is.

3042774,0,t1_cod686c,When you put conditions on when abortions should be allowed you are just adding water to an already slippery slope. You may disagree with a late term abortion but if you put time limits on a womans right to her bodily autonomy it really defeats the purpose and eventually that time limit can be argued down to less and less time until abortions are straight up illegal again.It may seem harsh to look at it as an all or nothing deal but it really needs to be so for the sake of womens rights. Either women are free to make their own choices about their bodies or they arent. Giving them a time limit is restricting their autonomy to an arbitrary point in time decided by someone who has no knowledge of what that woman is going through. There are so many factors surrounding abortion in the US that it cant be justified to put a limit on when this procedure can or cant be done. For example just look at Texas. Access to clinics is so slim that it might be impossible for a woman to find the time and money to get to a clinic when she wants to so its not like she is waiting just for the fun of it.,Feminism,coddsbz,6,t5_2qr7i

3252609,0,t3_2wzyn6,Ill say this I agree that this was a really fresh and interesting perspective on this issue. This is where Girls can really shine at times. This storyline was handled really well had multiple different layers and can be discussed and thought of very differently. It was open ended and didnt preach or give clearcut answers.Because the fact of the matter is that this is a really grey area after all. Of course a womans body is her own to decide over. But it takes two to create a life and it seems like a really medieval way to think about men as these kind of casanovas who only wish to spread their seed without regard for what that entails. As a man I would be extremely hurt and think Id have the right to be if I was told about something like this after the fact when in a serious relationship. I realize that ultimately it might not be my decision to make but Id definitely like to be let in on it if nothing else than to offer my love and support. Also and perhaps mostly Id be hurt over this because it feels like she might not feel remorse about withholding other big parts of her life from me. And what if she decided that she wouldnt have the abortion? That would have impacted me even more.I dont know.

3416440,0,t1_cpgt2br,When I initially wrote this response I misinterpreted the statistic  and assumed that the  value was not for the statistical estimation of annual rapes but for all alleged rapes reported to the police. Having now looked up the statistics which state Just  per cent went to the police telling researchers it was too embarrassing too trivial or a privatefamily matter. This would mean that the paragraph you are commenting on is actually factually incorrect albeit well intentioned.In light of the massive  non reporting rate the police conviction rate of  sees a significant rise to  which when you include cases dropped due to the emotional strain of the experience in addition to the other factors begins to look more reasonable when compared to rates for other crimes. For cases where there is an arrest  are convicted of a felony and  receive at least some conviction. Rape in particular has low rates of Pretrial release of rape defendants  for rape compared to  for all other violent crimes. s data of course the police and justice system could definitely stand to improve but I would suggest that the main improvements that need to be changed are to accessibility treatment of the plaintiff invasiveness of initial interviews and greater encouragement to come forward.TLDR It was never my intention to insinuate that the  figure was incorrect only that it was in many ways an inevitability in the light of our legal systems and I now have a greater realisation of how important it is to encourage higher levels of reporting. sorry for blabbing in response to your very concise response,Feminism,cphp5pm,2,t5_2qr7i

3939464,1,t3_35iusa,The reasons for that kind of response to your post are many! Here are a few thoughts. Some men are not really sexist and as such are around women and behave normally and treat women equally so they have no experience of why feminism is needed. To them things are equal so feminism feels like a constant attack for more and more and sounds like its criticising men like him. The issue here is that theyre not thinking on a global scale where the problems for women are huge and theyre also not aware that theyre not experiencing life from the women in his lifes perspective. Perhaps those women dont talk to him about the issues she faces maybe she doesnt feel interested in that topic and is content as things are. . There may be an underlying assumption that women are emotional irrational nagging bossy etc so whenever they see something that could come across as angry or demanding rather than actually listening to the content they are allowed to dismiss the opinions as falling under this classic womens behaviour thats just silly. Perhaps it reminds them of an unhappy wife theyve got who feels unheard and so often becomes upset at the poor state of communication not being valued etc but the man has learned to dismiss this because his underlying assumption is that women are silly. . Some people actually think women dont deserve equality! . Some men may have a confused view of what feminism actually is. Perhaps theyve seen and heard more extreme views and think its all to do with not wearing lipstick looking ugly and that these women want all women to be like this. . A lot of people in general can become defensive in the face of anger or whats perceived as anger if it feels in any way directed at them or holding them responsible. In that instance you have two options to agree which for someone feeling its a personal attack means conceding that they are at fault which for many people is a difficult thing to do even when it is correct or to disagree with as much anger or more than their attacker. So its all psychology lack of awareness insight education etc. Most people just arent able to reflect on their own thought processes and behaviours. Especially when culturally men are not so talkative on the subject of their own thoughts and feelings and tend not to challenge each other in the same way perhaps a group of women would. So the discussion is just not being had amongst them so much. With racism weve all seen and read about terrible outcomes of a society who actually agrees with racist ideas. Its depicted in films like  Years  a Slave we had the holocaust. Its a subject thats treated very seriously. Amongst my friends yes everyone would agree on racism as being bad. However the issues facing women are often not depicted seriously. Rape is on tv and film SO much. Oh god I just run out the room whenever I see anything like this. It upsets me so much but other people dont flinch! Theres not many things that go into the after effects of rape for that woman you dont see male rape hardly ever if you do it becomes this big deal. For women its often done in a sexy way aghh! So women are just not taken so seriously. And when there is something showing the terrible things women have suffered as a consequence of inequality I think men would be very unlikely to watch it! It would be perceived as a womans film and so they stay unenlightened about the experience for many women globally. Ok thats my rambling bit of insight. I hope this is useful!

Adding to the complicated mix in PNG is the cargo cult phenomenon which came out of WW where locals saw cargo descending from the skya mystery which only whiteskins held the key to.

This unfortunately doesnt solve the issue of high response times in other parts outside of college campuses so hopefully this app will inspire future app developers city officials and emergency departments to come up with ways to answer that question.     To expand the idea on high response times for emergency calls this app was created by students in a city where its about  minutes away from Detroit a city with terrible emergency response times.

I certainly dont think this app is designed for a city like Detroit where theres already terrible structural issues with their response time. ,Feminism,cut3jmy,3,t5_2qr7i

Im not sure if the writers dont feel like they have enough space to flesh out the characters or something about a visual fictional medium lends itself to objectification but for whatever reason I find things in even modern comics that I think would raise a few eyebrows if they appeared on TV.

6411968,0,t1_czb7n2e,At the end of the day although I believe women should be able to have as many sexual partners as they want without facing scrutiny Going out and finding a sexual partner for a a woman and as a man are on average two very different things. As the female is the one who puts a much larger amount of energy and resource into the act of reproduction generally she is the one that is sexually selective. Men can achieve a higher quantity of sexual partners  in terms of evolution  than a female can simply because  before birth control  she would get pregnant. If we stop pretending that men and women are exactly the same in every aspect we can come to see that perhaps these biological facts have something toDo with why men and men and women are being held up to different levels of scrutiny.A man who is capable of attracting a multitude of sexual partners is generally financially stable attractive intelligent some or all of those things. A women on the other hand will likely be able to find a sexual partner on a night out without really trying or necessarily having any of those qualities. Once again I dont agree with the fact that men and women are not treated equally I believe in genuine equality and as a society one would hope we could overcome such instinctual behaviours.

Because that feels a lot more like the problem. You cant just tell someone this is incredibly offensive without them getting defensive.  Living in the south its definitely Trump country and seems theres kind of a willing blindness of a lot of his supporters to recognize it as racism. Saying anything isnt standing up for others or calling out racism its contributing to some weird persecution mythos tied up in fears of pc culture and assaults their first amendment rights. Which no but I guess people will go to any lengths to view themselves as the hero of their own narratives.But then its weird because Ive also known some older people notably my  year old grandmother whos got a racism problem but there was also a cluster of people talking about it on rpoliticaldiscussion for whom Trump seems to have made her realize some of the problems of her own views lately. Perhaps its different for the lived through WWII demographic? I could see it watching similar rhetorical and crowdriling methods to Hitler rooted in problematic views you share with the Trump has maybe made her question where shes going?

An analog to this problem might just as well condemn racism but simultaneously defend an individuals right to be racist... Its like saying we need to treat black people like theyre equals but at the same time we need to defend the KKK because they have a right to hate niggers... How can you be so oblivious to such fundamental logical contradiction?  You cant simultaneously condemn and endorse the same position at least without argumentative difficulties...EDIT either the sexual objectification of women is good or bad.  It cant be both and it cant be conditional.  You cant take the Andrea dworkin position of porn as rape and at the same time applaud porn stars as liberated individuals who have taken ownership of their realities... Approaching from one side yields victimization approaching from the other yields conscious selfexploitation...

7800559,0,t1_d3su292,Im not sure your statement about Swedens rape rates are accurate. Sweden has had the highest rate of reported rapes in Europe since at least  but this is because in  they changed the legal peramitors and have made moves to get people actually reporting thier assaults. They arguably have the broadest definition of rape and sexual assault in the world.They last study on immigrants and rape in the country was back in  a long time ago in terms of public perception of rape and it concluded that foreigners were x more likely to commit a rape than a Swede born to Swedish parents. So this includes Arabs but also includes Americans Australians Africans other Europeans etc the only exception was East Asians . So obviously these attacks are serious and need to be addressed and although the cultural context need a to be aknowledge and dealt with its ridiculous and dangerous for women as well who still get attacked by people of all colours and creeds to pretend that sexual assault is just an ArabMuslim import.,Feminism,d3sudsi,4,t5_2qr7i

8632273,0,t1_d6jup44,I only know from my personal experience before I got the implant birth control I could barely function when I was on my period. The cramps would be so bad on the first couple days I could hardly leave bed and when I would get up it would be to throw up or to get air because I was sweating so bad or because diarrhea. Think of a stomach flu with no fever but all the other symptoms plus a stabbing pulsing pain In  your abdomen. After the implant I dont get the stomach flu symptoms and I can actually go to work and do normal stuff. I still get the before and after period migraines and legabdominal cramps though not as bad  I also breakout pretty bad because of the extra hormones and I get a bit more weepy at cheesy stuff. Its fuckin weird to me that as a woman I am supposed to completely ignore this thing that happens to me every fuckin month and act like it doesnt have any effect on me at all just so I dont appear like some weak little girl to my male counterparts. While they call out sick for the sniffles I have to act like something that is equivalent to a stomach flu or food poisoning is just fine and dandy because if I call out for my period Im a shit head who obviously cant handle life enough to compete.

8648666,0,t1_d6m0c5m,For me the sculpture itself is fine but the location is the problem. Unlike New York San Leandro is a suburb full of mostly singlestory houses. This sculpture will be very prominent so imposes its artistic message in a way few sculptures in New York do. Richard Serras Tilted Arc might be the best example of a New York sculpture whose scale imposed itself on others and that didnt work out so well. By being the focal point of an otherwise boring office building it will become the symbol of that office building. It feels like a mixed message that a tech office center which should be a place where women are valued  for their brains has a massive piece of art in front celebrating a womans body. Or maybe the scale of it will give the office park such a feminine feel to it that brogrammer culture will actually be tamed? Will male workers feel like they will be trampled to death by a giant woman if they dont treat their female colleagues with respect? Maybe the sculpture works that way?,Feminism,d6mp1hj,0,t5_2qr7i

8890253,0,t3_51ybxa,So heres the thing you have expressed quite a few views which are compatible with feminism and some that are not. To give you some sense of generally what aligns and what doesnt I will use some of your quotes as examples.gt I believe that all men and women should have equal opportunities in life.This is a feminist view point. gt But I also believe that women and men should be able to choose whatever lifestyle they want either working towards being a high profile surgeon an astronaut or staying at home with children if thats what they so choose and thats what they find fulfilling.This also a feminist viewpoint...however feminists often try to draw attention to the fact that many decisions regardless of whether or not they bring happiness to someone are influenced by both overt and subtle social pressures. gt By extension I dont think its a problem if we have different numbers of women to men doing certain professions. I dont believe in equality of numbers and I dont have a problem with the fact that men and women seem to have a bit of a bias towards certain professions. This is not a feminist viewpoint. Feminists understand that the current reality is that men more often go into technical labour intensive and scientific professions and women more often go into caring and domestic type professions. Feminists however assert that cultural and social pressures influence the types of jobs men and women are drawn to resulting in technical labour and scientific professions having environments that are often hostile to women and caring professions having lower pay and being so associated with femininity that they are unattractive to men. Feminism strives to deconstruct the cultural and social pressures that contributes to the continuation of these associations. Feminists also assert that children are influenced at a very young age by gender coded toys media representation and the intentional or unintentional influence of adults to gravitate towards certain professions. Thus feminists work against those pressures in the hope that men and women will be more free to choose professions that align with what they actually want to do. gt I believe that the idea of consent is very important...A feminist view.gt  I dont believe that the objectification of women is something that is taught by society to young boys even despite the sexualised imagery which exists... I believe mens behaviour is driven significantly by their selfish genes and its a biological burden which can lead many men to despair.Not a feminist view. Feminists dont deny that desire happens nor that it can manifest differently for different people nor that it is very difficult for both boys and girls during puberty. However feminists believe that boys are socialized to view sex as something they must pursue and are actively praised for being sexually active with many girls. Conversely women are socialized to view sex as something that is taken from them and diminishes their value while at the same time needing to be as sexually attractive to men as possible this is how objectification and sexualization is played out in our society. Placing this alongside the boys will be boys mentality creates a sexual culture that is potentially very dangerous to women because it teaches boys that they are not entirely responsible for their actions and women should bear the burden of gatekeeping male desire while simultaneously denying their own desires. Feminists generally believe that even though culture and society influences our actions everyone is responsible for their own behaviour and should not be called to account for the behaviour of another.gt I believe that both women and men should be able to dress however they want without judgement. However I also think that if you notice a guy checking you out you shouldnt think too harshly of him if youve chosen to wear something sexy unless hes acting creepy of course.Actually this is completely feminist. Feminists do not object to generally being checked out by others. The line is when it becomes leering gawking being approached on the street catcalling as you mentioned aggressive pursuit after boundaries have been firmly set etc.gt I dont think its realistic to think that men could ever completely control their gaze but I do think that cat calling is something that can be educated away. I think this is a misunderstanding of the term male gaze. Male gaze does not literally refer to men looking at women. Male Gaze is a concept that suggests that media in particular is offered in a manner that caters to mens desire to see women in sexual ways. Thus we see women in commercials TV movies print ads posters etc. depicted in poses that emphasize breasts or posteriors or are sexualized in some way. gt I believe that women should be encouraged to have a healthy body image and I also think that much of the reason that they dont is because of men. Some of this pressure from men is explicit but more powerful is the implicit pressure which simply comes from mens inherent desires being amplified through media.Feminists would likely agree with most of this sentence. However they would say its not necessarily mens fault that many women dont have a healthy body image rather its the cultural and social expectations as noted above that pressure women to value their appearance over their health. Though the patriarchy is set up to benefit men specifically both men and women can contribute to upholding this system. Feminists would also say that the focus on physical attraction is not so much inherent in men as it is something that is emphasized at a very young age in the messaging boys and girls are exposed to and thus it becomes so ingrained that it is difficult to separate it from the idea that it is genetically or biologically predetermined. Now to your question. You certainly have several ideas and beliefs that are consistent with feminism while you also hold some that are not. Feminism is a broad thing and there are many arms of feminism that disagree with each other on different things. If you wish to identify yourself as a feminist that is something that must be a personal decision on your part. Some feminists would say you are a feminist some would probably say you are skirting feminism but not quite there others would probably vehemently say you are not a feminist. I suggest just to keep learning thinking about it discussing it respectfully and keep an open mind. ,Feminism,d7ghdlz,8,t5_2qr7i

We have built a culture that dismisses rape and blames the victim for being in that situation.

As technotheist and ihaveasemicolon here has said feminism is not monolithic as much as it is centred on the experience of women no woman speaks or can speak for Feminism as a whole.Im a guy I am very sympathetic to feminist causes and make daily efforts to combat the patriarchys effect on men  yet I view any man describing themselves as a feminist with immediate suspicion as it is all too easy to label yourself One Of The Good Ones and not put the work in examining your own privilege and sit there explainingdebating the obvious to women or getting defensive when called out about sexist behavior we ALL do at some point. We should be putting our feelings aside and doing the reading and learning ourselves.But here is the big problem with your post and the reason i felt compelled to reply you have come to this subreddit and you want this diverse group of women mostly feminists on reddit entirely unrelated to your friends on Tumblr to explain or take responsibility for the actions of some jerk radfems who apparently we cannot verify them said these bad things. I dont see why anyone here should have to. A feminist say a bad thing to you? Take it up with them everybody else tangentially involved with a movement should not have to take responsibility for someones jerkish behavior.Mens hurt feelings are not why feminism exists and these activist women do not dance to the tune that some nutters on Tumblr play. gtYou dont know how much preferential treatment women get sometimes.

I think that is an American stat  In the case of the surgical wage gap in the fotune article make surgeons would need to make  per hour more than women for the gap to make sense in that way.Blaming babies is also innacurate because two of the article above talk about hourly wages and assuming all women had babies and lost out on raisespay time because of babies is a major assumption when in Canada our statistics state women are having less babies at higher ages and this only become a bigger pattern the longer time goes on.This fact SHOULD also change as paternal rights becomes more and more prominent in child care discussions. Fathers should be able to have as much time off to meet their new babies as the mother.  This would close that loophole and give men their proper parental rights at the same time yay feminism and mens rights working together! LolI also want to point out the fact that womens wage gap is higher in careers with a higher numbr of men working in them  could this be a coincidence?  It is just an opinion I cant back up but the harder it is for women to break into an industry the larger the wage gap seems to be based on my research...You are also throwing assumptions that they made facts up with nothing to back up your claims. I am not  sure there is a wage gap however no one else should be sure there is no such thing. There is enough evidence to cast doubt on your certainty and if it takes women to get out and get protesting for the proper research to be done which addresses the issues of womens life choices etc. Good!!!Just to confirm  BLS bureau of labour research?

On this i can only say that i was lazy andor ignorant for not including the option.I disagree with the last paragraph. In that case it would probably be more accurate to instead ask What gender do most people see you as regardless of your identified gender?

10168579,0,t1_dbwml2h,Mental illnesses is generally a subject of much discussion and disagreement. Even just the what is a mental illness? question is one that many health care professionals cant agree on fully.Is being transgender normal? No the majority arent transgender. Does it have a negative effect on the individual? That depends on the person and their environment. Are there clear physiological differences that cause transgenderism whats the word here? Not as far as I know. Is it a group that needs protection and support? In many cases yes.I cant say if I think being transgender is an illness or not  I havent looked into the subject enough to say so. But I do know that the diagnostic categories for mental illnesses come down to a lot more than just science. Politics culture and values play a huge part in our definitions because the definitions arent meant as descriptors of universal truth but as tools for helping people who suffer. Some of the categories show this aspect a lot and are often used as garbage bins for people suffering from something that doesnt really fit anywhere else and who need help depression anxiety and especially stress are often used like that.In the same light the redefinition might come partly down to politics  one Danish people are generally pretty liberal about these things and if being transgender is defined as an illness it wouldnt fit with the view of the people who dont see transgender individuals as sick. Two I think someone mentioned that this might be to cut out the cost for treatment for this group  this could fit with the current government who want to cut spending in the social health areas in general but this seems like a quite small and specific expense TBH so Im not sure theyd bother.

Its totally socially acceptable to watch porn but if you make porn its because society has failed you! and youre forever soiled and unemployable. Nevermind the fact that in order to even find out that a woman has done porn you have to run across it while watching porn supporting the same industry that you spit on. And its the same for all kinds of sex work. Going to strip clubs or visiting a sex worker might be seen as a bit sleazy but the women who provide those services are treated like theyre broken. And more often than not the thing people find sleazy about it is having contact with those broken dirty women. Its ridiculous. And it all stems from the idea that sex is something that is taken from one person and given to another. And wouldnt you know it its almost always thought of as taken from women.

I am here to discuss the article in a clear rational and nonoffensive manner I assume you are here to do likewise in good faith I agree with you it does seem to begt a post that complains about something frustrating and important.My confusion is caused by the fact the author claims that men ought to be reading it meaning it is targeted at men and ought to aim to change their behaviour and fix the problem. It seems men are the intended audience but the article lacks the sensitivity required to change the mind of any human being.I also agree it is not her job to package it digestably to suit my specific needs or the needs of any man woman child or other organism . Labour intensive or not she is not being paid to do that as far as I am aware.Does my confusion make sense in the context of a peice ostensibly aimed at men that does not seem to appeal men?I am confused because this peice may lack the potential to accomplish the stated goal of the author that saddens me.gtfeeling attacked is your fault becuse it seems like you are responsible for much of thisI am going to assume you meant that nonoffensivly and in good faith.Sure the way I reacted to the peice is on me thats why I asked for a second opinion about the reading. But we seem to agree that the price does not appeal or cater to men despite claiming to be aimed at changing the minds of men.Why do you claim I am responsible for much of this though?

10640155,0,t1_ddd01gf,If you think feminism stops at equality then youve got it all wrong. Yes thats part of it but its also about ensuring that women are safe and free from harassment. Its about changing the way we think as a society so that no one has to tolerate being harassed in the streets. She is a minor. Grown men harassed a minor. How can you defend that? How can you attempt to shift blame on her by telling her to grow up? Stop treating her like its her fault for being sensitive and acknowledge that those men are in the wrong. ,Feminism,dddg871,6,t5_2qr7i

10990239,0,t3_5wvj8a,If you look at fashion history skirts were the original garment worn. When pants were invented they were a fairly complex garment that would have required some degree of resources to acquire. So there had to be a good reason for someone to go through the process of getting pants and in the past roles that required pants were more or less only held by men so I think that is the origin of the gender divide on skirts. As someone who has worn a skirt as a costume I will say that they are VERY impractical for men because the fabric becomes very difficult to manage while peeing standing up. I dont know if women find them practical or not. I am pretty sure however that he main reason they survive is because they are a failsafe way for a woman to identify as a woman and many women enjoy making a gendered fashion choice like that. The sad reality of rape is that clothing choices truly dont matter and most women understand that. I dont think anyone would avoid wearing a skirt because it makes them more vulnerable to sexual assault.,Feminism,dedpj17,2,t5_2qr7i

11022382,0,t3_5wzck5,People are not massproduced and ideas too should be treated on a person to person basis. You have to understand what sort of prejudices the person has and help himher to break them down. Supposing that you are a feminist you can be an example how feminism is not an antimale ideology for example. Naturally this is not possible with everybody and not fully. Trying however is good. ,Feminism,dehcuuj,1,t5_2qr7i

11345321,0,t3_61tr2x,Im a little surprised by the comments here. Isnt the idea that dress codes are usually sexist? There are never typically dress codes against men and dress codes inherently sexualize the female body to a higher degree. And werent these women young? Way too young to be sexualized? Doesnt this sub typically admonish schools that have sexist dress codes like leggings and bare shoulders are too distracting and dont represent their school well? Why should a plane have a dress code saying  year old girls cant wear leggings? Who cares if they were free riders why do young girls need to dress like theyre business professionals?,Feminism,dfhz09b,13,t5_2qr7i

11663034,0,t1_dghgz6n,The only thing I dont like about that is the idea that changing youre body is what makes you the other gender. I support peoples decisions to change their body in whatever way to make themselves happy why live and not feel good about yourself? But i also dont like the idea that being uncomfortable with your body is a necessary part of claiming a femalemale identity. Your sex organs arent your gender and its really toxic to be told that over and over again as a child.,Feminism,dgi0q4r,8,t5_2qr7i
