1754962,0,t3_2e8fod,Go get a copy of the  Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss. If you cant get one PM me and Ill see what I can do for you.Why am I telling you to do this? Three reasons.One you hate what you do and know other things must be possible but you dont know which things are possible nor which youd like to do.Two you are seriously considering doing something you hate for a career and you shouldnt be.Three you dont have and need the skillset to escape your current circumstances and the hww will give you that skillset.,RBNLifeSkills,ck0dcvv,0,t5_2zys9
2193660,0,t1_clij90i,But I feel stuck in this stupid apartment and when I think about moving to the area I want to live in I dont even know what cities to look at places in and I dont know what jobs are there that I would be good at. I really want someone to help me so I dont make an even bigger mistake.  I dont have friends to practice with. Plus my landlord still hasnt replied to my email and I dont know what to text him. I know I can change jobs but I feel like I want my first job out of college to be a good fit for me. Its not like I havent done stuff in the past that I enjoyed like data entry and stuff like that so I do know some things I like. I just dont know what job titles to look for or how to negotiate salary and shit like that.,RBNLifeSkills,clio2cd,1,t5_2zys9
2277084,0,t3_2lav02,Hey so as a mental health therapist and I really think you guys should look into potential options of care. There are things like mindful eating centers that have low cost groups. If you have insurance you would likely have access to mental health care as parity is legally required in the US.  I feel like addictioneating problems or eating disorders really are territory thats best dealt with experts and a true treatment plan if that makes sense. Usually because these things are tied to so many other issuesemotional stuff that its not really straight forward advice that people can really give you. Another user suggested calorie counting and for many people that would make things even worse and because were just people on the internet and many people here arent mental health professionals I think its best to try to get treatment.  I know many people have financial constraints. If youd like to PM me I might be able to help you think of a few alternatives to getting care.,RBNLifeSkills,clt5znj,3,t5_2zys9
2669368,0,t3_2qkg60,If you are in the states you can call  ask for housing assistance resources tell them youre a minor. If you are  you may be able to get financially emancipated but you might be put into the foster care system which is not fun. If you are  you may need to start looking at homeless shelters etc.   Homelessness protips  get a cheap gym membership preferably somewhere open  as this will be a safe place to shower if you cant do so at a homeless shelter and  if there isnt a bed at the homeless shelter ask for resources food is often easy to come by if you know where to look.  Please PM me if you need other suggestions for getting hooked up with resources in your area. ,RBNLifeSkills,cn70dj0,8,t5_2zys9
2814347,0,t1_cnnz98i,Mint does look very interesting and I surely will show it to my husband.  This might also have helped us to realize that that one utility hadnt taken the money out and that the autopay had failed again.  I want to trust autopay I really do.  But well no I need to stop wanting to have that illusion. Autopay systems only sometimes work.  sigh ,RBNLifeSkills,cnnzf2c,3,t5_2zys9

3280555,0,t3_2ww865,Im so sorry this happened to you. Im an emotional eater with a history of bulimia so I completely relate to this. Daughters of Nparents often fall into this category if RBN is anything to go by. I got therapy in college for the eating disorder but I still binge when extremely emotional.  Im looking for solutions too.Im older almost  and one of the things Ive found strangely comforting is everyone even normal successful people that you meet are walking wounded. Life scars us all eventually. I like knowing that despite the facade everyone has a vulnerable emotional core that needs healing and support. Maybe not all to the same degree but it makes me realize Im not some sort of defective freak Im just human. So heres a big internet hug. Youre in good company.,RBNLifeSkills,cp27kes,5,t5_2zys9

4648149,0,t3_3empct,You dont say if youre male or female nor what country youre in.Zara would be a good choice as theyre both affordable colourful enough and have a large enough range for both men and women to explore their look in the workplace. You can also shop there online.uzataks has some good options here too.Please make sure you are dressing stylistically similarly to your new bosses. This is the best way to look as though you want to move up in the company.,RBNLifeSkills,ctggnyc,1,t5_2zys9
5118238,0,t3_3kqzwq,What works for me personally is naming my emotions and asking myself what I need eg Im very upset and I need to feel comforted. Then I try to meet that need.If I made a mistake I remind myself that I did my best Im a human being and human beings make mistakes that nobody died and I dont need to feel ashamed of making a mistake. This is important!The paradox of facing negative emotions is that to change we must first accept what is. Avoiding negative emotions doesnt make them go away as you have observed. Acknowledging them can bring relief as you arent trying to suppress them. Notice the feeling. Remind yourself that this is a feeling and not your entire self that you dont have to completely become the feeling. And try to be kind to yourself.,RBNLifeSkills,cv2xtt7,4,t5_2zys9
5503691,0,t1_cwexqrh,I didnt read this part before. The agent is right you dont have to change DMV registration since its short term. And since you own a home in another state that makes it easy to keep that state as your official state of residence. But you definitely need to change your homeowners policy to a landlord policy! Your agent can handle that for you too. Even if your tenants arent paying rent insurance will not cover anything unless you change the policy. Its simple and costs about the same amount so dont worry about that. Or if the house is vacant you need to inform insurance of that too. Sometimes they will not cover vandalism if a house has been vacant too long.,RBNLifeSkills,cwf5c4i,1,t5_2zys9

6198157,0,t3_40dyb5,Simplest way to sound more active? Smile as in actually physically smile while on the phone. It changes the shape of your mouth aside from the obvious mental aspects of positive thinking. This should raise your voice slightly. Worked in a pizza place and it was policy you had to smile while answering. When you are backed up one hour in orders and someone else calls in you can be dejectedmean when answering. It really worked for us and dropped customer complaints. Starting with a initial positive interaction also buys you a lot of goodwill which smooths over other things. ,RBNLifeSkills,cyu5x8v,1,t5_2zys9
6352654,0,t3_42j5bs,Apartment hunting Get a list online of apartment complexes in your town. If they have a website do some research. But do call! Apartments are a fairly offline business especially for the cheap ones you probably want.Stay in the USA  Are you on a visa? Make sure to follow up on that first. Deportation kinda kills all the rest.Job You want a career based on your degree. You may need a job to tide you over. Get a letter from a prof as Clasi has said its hard to ask but worth its weight in gold to have a letter on official letterhead saying you are awesome. Also build your profile on LinkedIn. Its like Facebook without any personal stuff or drama. Stay in touch with friends classmates and college profs over the years. They may be the person who knows of the job you need! Dont stick only to your industry either this is a way to help find friend of a friend unposted jobs which is most of the job economy! RBN makes it hard for us to lean on others but its how I got every job above minimum wage that I have had. Sent them a gift basket when the job pans out at Christmas.Your college may have a careers center that can guide you through making a decent resume and help with job postings. Ask your professors too.But lastly dont flake out on job opportunities. Even if its wrong say so to them and move on. Everybody talks to everyone else so be a pro about it. This is the biggest piece of advice I would give to myself at your point in life. Follow through. This job may be wrong but they may be friends with the related job guy across town that is right. Joe is looking for someone for X who do you know? is how every job listing starts. Be remembered for being the cool X not the sneaky guy who flaked out.,RBNLifeSkills,czbq5o8,3,t5_2zys9
6527340,0,t1_czufyra,Are you saying I should immately grab her tits to indicate my interest? Just kidding. Yeah I hear you on the missing social cues but in my case Id say its part of that deeply ingrained habit of playing the innocuous grey rock in order to fend off the sexualizedoverstepping narc weirdness in my own family.I mostly know whats going on i.e. if a woman is interested in me but I cant deal with nonverbal communication because it stays in that realm of plausible deniability which I know from my narc family. Unfortunately for me this is what many women intuitively do rather than being straightforward and outspoken with their intentions. Somehow I dont think it would work if I told a woman to be blunt but maybe I should try.Mostly however I dont even get to that dating level in the first place. I immediately recoil as soon as I spy any indicator of potential interest.,RBNLifeSkills,czuh984,2,t5_2zys9

7501521,0,t3_4i2mga,Try to remember that you probably feel this way because you lived with people who disapproved of you so you expect the same from your boss. Which can make work super triggering.My number one work tip is kind of like crossing the road stop look listen. Before you react or respond take a deep breath. And generally a good way to cope at work is to be in the habit of pausing and observing whats going on and giving yourself time to decide whats best to do which can take practice I want to be clear that Im not saying this should be easy.I used to feel like I was going to pass out if my boss wanted to talk to me as my brain took it as youre getting told off now.,RBNLifeSkills,d2uvtzl,3,t5_2zys9
7679088,0,t3_4jcchh,Im really kinda broke right now and this is what I do so if you dont have a lot of money then get them shaped and waxed just once and every day keep up the shape that theyve created by plucking any stray hairs. Thats what I do and it works fine.  But if you can afford it I think a monthly wax is really great. You said yours are bushy so what I do for that is to dab a tiny bit of petroleum jelly on mine to keep them smooth and then I brush through with a clean mascara wand and it kinda holds them in shape. Some girls spray hairspray on the mascara wand and do it like that instead. Cheap simple and effective. x,RBNLifeSkills,d3f2egk,1,t5_2zys9
8986402,0,t3_53d6hu,As weird as it may sound seek out ppl who look like you would like them. Somehow its easy to just tell. Or arrange a big cards against humanity game with a group. It brings everyone out of their shells and can be great for breaking  the ice. This is weird advice so more practical ppl who have backpack decorations for things you like or shirts with your interests can help. ,RBNLifeSkills,d7s101w,2,t5_2zys9
