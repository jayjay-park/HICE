5505,0,t3_1u6n3m,When I think of distortion I think of it in terms of a guitar. Theres Fuzz Overdrive and distortion. If you look at the application of these three varieties of saturation throughout music you start to see where you can implement them into your music.Distortion is a great effect that quickly adds a lot of color and harmonics to any instrument. Often found on leads however like a guitar lead distortion can make any sound quickly cut through a mix.Overdrive is typically used on cleaner sounds and will fatten a sound up to make it more full sounding. Overdrive is a great affect that allows thin sounding guitars like a Fender Stratocasters to cut through a mix. Again most current electronic music is very heavily saturated so overdrive is typically not as popular in EDMFuzz is really a sound mangling tool. I would look into different Fuzz pedals and see what people have done with the idea of saturationFuzz. Theres a lot of creative people out there that have turned fuzz into a really fun tool for different sounds. I personally have a Zvex Fuzz Factory guitar pedal that I effects loop through my synths to get a pretty nasty sound. It even has a sinewave oscillator on a knob to get different color to your distortion. Things like Gates Compressors and EQ really shape a fuzz quickly.Lastly like you mention saturation is a great tool on your master channel. I like to use a multiband saturator like the one that comes in Ozone  or Fab Saturn to gently boost some of the lower highs and the snare. If you are looking for the mecha of saturator plugins or any mixing mastering bundles I would look into Fab Filters total bundle. It comes with everything you need for anything in the mixingmastering stage and tons more at a competitive price comparatively speaking.If you are interested in the actually theory and history of distortion which could help you find more uses for it heres a link to the history of the tube sound in music. ,edmproduction,cef2aud,3,t5_2sa4x

50076,0,t1_ceil7p6,Its pretty nice I like the chord progression for sure. Maybe you could make the kick stand out a bit more? It sounds a little soft to me but if thats what you were going for thats cool its only my opinion. But to make my kicks stand out I usually use layer one or two kicks for the bass and the subbass depending on the song then I layer a snare or a kick thats been pitched and eqed so the upper mids and trebles stand out and then I adjust the eq levels and the compression on all of them so it sounds more seamless. But other than that it sounds really nice great composition!TLDR Cool song and if you want your kick drum to stand out more add some layers to it.,edmproduction,cek4qo4,1,t5_2sa4x

Then a subby bass too but a bit quieter heavy sidechained disabling the kick reverb trick when this comes. No need of proper sine subbass and sometimes I play some low percussion hits instead of a proper Korg bass for example. Sometimes I go for the easy way a really subby kick with long decay no sub needed as well.Tip to check how is working isolate the hz frecuency range I use C or ProMB and solo it to hear how is the lowend working. Adjust the sidechain threshold from there and the kick decay as well. Reference values for my style peaks of this band around  RMS from  to  it depends on what kind of bass you picked. Try to isolate subs of the kind of songs you are aiming for and note values as reference. Tip  I use frecuency splitters in the bass and sometimes in the kick anything below  goes mono the rest can be wider.This is just my amateurish way of working hope it helps to someone.,edmproduction,ceq54fy,3,t5_2sa4x

However with presets in Massive this often means deleting a minor pitch feature that was included in the original sound that can sometimes change everything about it. You can just make one from scratch but you still lose the ability to use the pitch function for anything else when you do this macro assignment. ,edmproduction,cexqzij,1,t5_2sa4x

227908,0,t1_cf48ayv,Thats bullshit. Being famous is a form of appreciation of your work. We all like appreciation for our work. Clearly his friend is getting more even though op feels he puts in way more passion. I can totally see where hes coming from.Having said that there is a huge difference in what the audience eats. Take appreciation in what you do and keep pushing on. I myself go apeshit over shitty tiny edits and I know I will nog gain a large audience over that given effort. But I do love what I make. I wish the larger audience would see what effort I put in but in the end they dont give a shit whether its you using Nexusfamous sample packs OR fm. You should maybe choose either way. I chose to have more fun in working on a ms effect for two hours straight instead of ramming out a complete tune from my trance template. ,edmproduction,cf4dcg4,38,t5_2sa4x

241927,0,t3_1wvb9h,Layering and proper EQ are the main things. I like to add a bit of saturation as well to liven things up. My layers are usually like thisSub playing root LP at ish HzLow Bass very gritty similar to an electro bass playing just the root note HP at Hz Low shelf at  db to leave room in highsMiddy supersaw standard detuned supersaw but with minimal stereo spread this helps the chords be heard when track is in mono. light HP around Hz light LP around kHz playing chordsWide supersaw detuned pan modulation stereo width etc the whole shebang. slightly boosted highs HP around Hz. Playing chordsWhite Noise HP around kHzLead optional doesnt exactly follow chords plays notes that add suspensions ths or ths to the chord rather than following the root has to be gritty enough to cut through distortion helps but thin enough not to conflict with the supersaws. Cutting a notch in the supersaw where the root of the lead is usually helps thisBus all of these tracks together and compress a fair bit to glue everything together. Add whatever youre going to use to sidechain compressor LFO tool etc and get it sounding good. if you want to add reverb I suggest using a send and then sidechaining that send to the original supersaw bus to prevent muddiness. Another part of getting the supersaws to sound Seven Lionsesque is the chords you use. Dont just use the   and  get a bit weird with it. Try adding maj s min s s s etc where they sound like they fit. Dont be afraid to have big chords that span a few octaves. Im not an expert but here is an example where I used the technique in a track of my ownYou can hear examples of the supersaw at   and .Hope this helps someone out.edit The track I linked isnt mixed the best the low bass is a bit too loud.

247439,0,t3_1wxznk,Id say before you go paying for AbletonDubspot classes you should fuck around in FL Studio. I dont know how much music theory you know but learn that make some melodies learn how to use tension and release learn more sound design. Theres plenty of free stuff out there before you have to pay money for anything. I dont know what genre you prefer but analyze how the pros do it. Analyze how they progress through the song what elements they add what they take away all the layers.Maybe Im just rambling but with the VSTs you listed and FL Studio you have endless possibilities you just have to mess around for a while. Try to finish one song per day doesnt mean it has to be a soundcloud worthy song at least try to start a new song everyday if you have the time.

270449,0,t3_1x7a5t,When side chain compressing a basssub to a kick like this youre not looking for a big pumping sound where the side chaining is obvious.  You want it set just enough to get the bass out of the way for the kick to come through and be back in the mix with presence as fast as possible without obvious pumping to the volume returning.Heres what I think is a good process to go about it Get your kicks levels EQ and otherwise processed first. Add your bass track to the mix. On the side chained compressor on the bass track Attack ms.  Typically when side chaining other parts of the track melody vocal etc you want this to be .  However with the bass you want a bit slower attack for two reasons  . Super short attack settings on bass tracks can cause clicking amp pops.  . Allowing just a bit of the bass through on just the kicks attack will will help accentuate the kicks attack before backing off to let the kicks body through. Release The final setting here is going to depend on how long your kick is.  I typically will start at about ms and then slowly turn it up until I can hear the whole kick coming through. Ratio I usually start with db reduction and tweak. Really though you kind of have to tweak the release and ratio together.  For example you might be sitting there thinking I cant hear the kick coming through yet Ill crank up the release but all that does is squash more of the bass timewise when really the release was where it needed to be and you actually needed to increase the ratio so that it ducks further under the bass while the compressor is active.Another trick I like to do with subs to add a good style boom to the kick is to instead use a gate on the sub side chained to the kick so that the sub only sounds when the kick hits.  So its sort of the opposite of the normal basskick side chaining thing.  A simple example Create a clip and add  full quarter notes of a sine wave hitting at whatever sub bass frequency you want.  Duplicate that out across the entire track. Add a gate to it with its side chain set to the kicks mixer output. Tweak the attack so that the kick comes through before the sub is fully let through. Tweak the hold and release to set how long the boom is and how fast it fades out. Adjust the level on the sub track appropriately.That simple.  This way the sub only sounds when the kick hits and any time you want the kick without the sub just delete the sub clip in that part of the track.,edmproduction,cf8sj7t,5,t5_2sa4x

I think this might be especially prevalent in the brand of dubstep you cited to really accentuate that ONE two THREE four pattern in the drums. It might also help the snare punch through more as some of the snares peaks that arent near that  range might be sitting in the same ranges that your midrange basses or other synths are sitting and those sounds are usually doing a bunch of shit.

416192,0,t3_1yuk8q,When you have one sound that you like part of but not all of it or think it needs something else that you cant from that synth or sound. Example Ive been practicing drum synthesis because Im terrible at it. However what Ive been finding is that I really like the upper part of synth snares but hate the body and attack. So what Ive been doing is making a snare in massive then finding an acoustic sample to use as the attack or a tom sample for the body and mix between all of them to get a nicer sound. Another example is with supersaws. I really like big thick super saws. So what I do sometimes is create one patch thats warm sounding for inner voices of a chord to make it thick down in the mids. However in doing so its not very bright and doesnt have the shimmer I also want... so I make another brighter patch and use it for the upper voices. Then I can balance the brightness and warmth between the two. Throw in strings playing both and you end up with thick and full sounds without getting noisy or harsh. Its like additive synthesis except using a lot more than one synth. ,edmproduction,cfnwk4h,6,t5_2sa4x

508192,0,t3_1zxpii,I think a lack of melody and rhythm are the main problem. Changing the rhythm of the chordskeys  would really help and since the song is at  making the chords a straight quarter doesnt add any energy. Also the sound itself sounded kinda cheap and bland and i would replace it since i dont think processing it more would help. Percussion could also help spice up the song and would really help with the repetitiveness by adding and taking stuff out. Make sure you are adding a groove by moving things off the grid and make it sound more natural it really make a pretty big difference imo.  Personally i would start a new song since i feel there isnt anything in this track that worth working on it more.

There you need to fix it with distortion multiband processing...In the arrangement it involves having little but loud instruments. Like Dont have more than  elements playing at once. For the mix dont overreverb the mix. Attenuate the highs from some instruments to make others shine therein and again mix the high end stuff louder in to taste. Dont mix in the subbass too loud too because that will eat the headroom needed to make other things shine through.Another good thing to do to fill the high end is highpassed noise with reverb or a  ride that is quiet enough to not hear in the mix but noticeably gone when muted.,edmproduction,cg4bo7b,-3,t5_2sa4x

601604,0,t3_2113s5,When layering I personally try in the first place to find some samples that work good together dry. Its dumb imo to try to make much processing on things arent working together. youll often lose your time and be frustrated Thats my general rule about it. You should also always consider to avoid phase cancellation. For example if I want to make a kickdrum I should not layer up a Hz kick with a Hz one  good chances that this isnt gonna work at all. Every layer should also have its place and be EQd. Using multiband compression andor limiting on the bus may also give that extra punch. After all that its also a question of time. Making a very good kick may take a big effort sometimes but once you did it you may use it in a lot of projects ,edmproduction,cg8nmc5,1,t5_2sa4x

Compression brings the volume of those sounds up and tamps down the loudest frequency thus creating a fuller sound.If youre using an oscillator or something that doesnt produce other frequencies there would be no filling effect.Its like the difference between a chord heavily compressed instrument or a note not compressed only the fundamental tone is heard.This is what I think I hear..

618262,0,t3_217qjx,Most of the time compression isnt actually the correct answer. The reason some inexperienced producers think that compression solves everything likely stems from the fact that compression reduces dynamic range and will ultimately make quiet sounds louder. Human ears tend to like louder sounds better and because they are louder you can hear them more clearly. This is the same logic that has driven the whole loudness wars thing.Compression nonparallel is usually a solution when you need to glue a variety of sounds together in a mix drum bus compression is great for example or when you want to shape transients with the attack and release settings again usually on kick drums or maybe a bass synth. Otherwise there are probably better solutions than just straight compression for accomplishing what you want.,edmproduction,cgajppf,1,t5_2sa4x

Commitment is everything.Failure is subjective.  To some people being a loser means moving back in with their parents because they tried to make it and failed to other people it means never trying.  Im not trying to feed you horseshit platitudes these are things you really have to think about and decide for yourself.  Most people who read this are going to automatically stick themselves in the dreamer category then fifteen minutes later they are going to be right back to jerking off and looking at cats.  gt Do I need to make sacrifices to become successful?NO!  Just go buy some success from your nearest success store even better wait till the holidays and get it half off.  Or maybe the piece youve been missing this whole time is tip number seven in that other tab you have open.  Youre just one spoonfed epiphany away from all your dreams coming true!  You dont have to sacrifice you can finally have your cake and eat it too!  You just need to take these fish oil pills.  Thats the one missing factor thats been standing between you and your dreams.  These orange pills that smell and taste like shit are the final push thats going to get you started on the downhill rollercoaster to dreamland.

682285,0,t1_cghruzz,I think it still affects the sustain..release setting.I just think of it as a different way to shape your amp envelope instead of using compression or saturation.To me transient designers seem to generally be more transparent than a compressor. It seems like you have more direct control of the volume of the attack and sustain portions of your sound.A compressor seems to alter your amp envelope in more complex and subtler ways with how the ratio threshold attack and release settings work.A compressor seems to take a more derivative approach to shaping the amp envelope in regards to the attacksustain. A transient shaper seems more straight forward. Youre just adjusting the volume of the transient and the volume of the sustain. A compressor gives you a lot more flexibility but also a lot more possible headaches as you tweak.I think some people prefer the transient designers either for transparency or for ease of use in their workflow.Edit Also I forgot to mention that transient designers process independent of the input level.

I dont give two shits if someone thinks using a loop or sample is lazy or not original. The end product is what Im after and I enjoy the process of taking things apart and building something out them. I think a lot of people that say you have to make everything from scratch are full of shit. I can and often do make drums percs and a ton of other sounds from scratch because I enjoy that to. I like using everything available to me and think that not doing so would be silly. I resample my own stuff quiet a bit as well. Telling someone to only use what you make is silly. If what I do isnt music because Ive sampled something then what about a guitarist. Does the guitarist need to build his instrument? Does a drummer need to make his own drums. Does a horn player need to craft his on horn? The idea that using samples is a bad thing is elitist. I think it will also stifle creativity. yeah I know someone might say using a sample is creative....that may or may not be subjective...I dont care...I may go sample my neighbors dog taking a shit and make it into a lead now just because I can.tldr Do whatever you want and fuck what everyone says about it.

Its really fun though if you lock it to a MIDI Scale in Ableton and assign some sounds and just go crazy with. Also check out Lauchpad so you can use it in an almost similar fashion to Ableton Push.

Most of us know far more than wed like to know about EQ. Its a pain and can be quite time consuming and annoying to do but ultimately its for the best. Sometimes youll have two sounds that occupy the same space in the frequency spectrum and wont be able to split them up without losing a substantial part of one of them and thats where panning can be an amazing asset.,edmproduction,cgt3fb1,4,t5_2sa4x

795292,0,t1_cguiv5u,Your brains basically just a learning algorithm it finds structure in sensory input. Basically the circuits that get used more stay. The circuts that dont have any activity go away.Most of our amazing capability to find information comes from having whats essentially  functioning computerssee hemispherectomy in our head that compare the sensory input.Pretty much all of our basic functionse.g. visual perception auditory location finding are based upon this divide between left and right. Different angles for our eyes and different delays for our ears.Anyways random musing aside I dont think theres a lot you can do based upon height perception. Our ears work in two dimensions its to the left or to the right. Its the correlated information with the eyes that gives us height perception.Filtering is more of a depth kind of thing front and back. Sound is filtered the longer it travels through the air. Has something to do with the inverse square law or something. When you filter a sound you get a really poor emulation of what stuff far away sounds like.The only thing I could see you getting a height perception out of is reverb. Its not going to be specific to height going closer to any of the three axises will change the predelay of natural reverb downwards.Maybe if you modulated the predelay of one reverb in a reverb stack you could get a bit of heightrd dimension tone from it. The stuff theyre talking about in this article is mainly d stufffrom different delays on each channel either height or width depending upon if youre lying down or standing up.,edmproduction,cguof3u,1,t5_2sa4x

Then layer with some white noise and use an FM synth for the transient I use fm just make a short decayed sound with lots of fm so it sounds atonal. Then compress transient shape EQ A LOT very short reverb. Ive gotten sick result with this! Also layer with acoustic stuff. But its mostly the eq that does it. There are great tutorials watch the ones by Dan Larssonletsynthesize.If you want the BAAAAANG snares that KOAN sound use sometimes theyve said that its usually acoustic snares run through a lot of distortion.

924164,0,t3_24oz4s,Honestly if someone asks me a nb question like whats compression and why should I bother with it? or how can I master my track to make it chart on Beatport? I guess I kinda expect it. The Internet is full of dumb questions. HOWEVER flaming andor belittling these nbs will NOT help them and even more importantly it will NOT help the scene as a whole. I treat every question even the really nave ones as valid. If theyre asking for something that doesnt exist like some kind of RageoMatic Ozone preset that makes any track sound like Skrillex then Ill state simply that what theyre asking for doesnt exist and try to explain in laymans terms WHY that is the case. If theyre asking about advanced techniques when theyre clearly still struggling with the basics I try to explain why they should slow down and master the foundation skills first. The best cure for dumb questions is education and since people tend to automatically stop listening and learning when they can tell theyre being made fun of or talked down to its much better to answer their questions simply and without any snark. Yes we will end up answering the same dumb questions hundreds of times over but if we think of the newbies as our trainees and take pride in their progression to higher skill levels then there will be fewer clueless nbs out there churning out shit tracks and flooding the market with garbage. We all want there to be an abundance of good music in the world right?

961245,0,t1_chbrmx9,Quite frankly the best explanation so far is the one about the gnomeA compressor is a volume automator you can think of it as something that controls the fader to your channel and the way that it automates the volume is dictated by your attack release settings along with your ratioThere are several ways to use a compressor the one that people seem to be talking about is to make the quiet parts seem louder this is achieved only if you are compressing the peak amplitudes of the signal. Lets say the signal was peaking at db and you compress the peaks so now it is only hitting db this gives you more headroom and you are able to raise the gain by db effectively making all amplitudes of the signal rise by db which makes the quiet bits louder. this is reducing the dynamic range which is the range of your smallest amplitude to your largest amplitude. This is also known as raising your RMS which is the root mean square of your amplitude pretty sure and by raising your RMS you raise the percieved level of loudness. Thats why when someone says a track sounds over compressed its because someone compressed their track using this technique to a point where the dynamic range is very small and everything just sounds like it was squeezed out of a sausage pump. Note that you can also achieve this reduction of dynamic range with a limiter although how it goes about doing it is different.However there are other ways to use a compressor depending on your settings you can let peak amplitudes through without compressing them. For example a kick drum you can let the transient through and make the kick more punchier however this kind of compression generally does not reduce the dynamic range in this case it is increasing the dynamics of the signal.Compressors are also commonly used in busses which is basically a track where multiple signals are routed to for processing or whatever purpose u may have for doing it. By compressing multiple signals together with the same compressor you can in essence glue them together by altering the dynamics of all the signals by the same amountThere is also techniques like parallel compression and sidechain compressionbut in any case instead of asking on reddit about basic things like this you really should google and study what it is and find out things for yourself  you learn much more by figuring things out by yourself and you also avoid misinformation,edmproduction,chdjwhh,2,t5_2sa4x
965092,0,t3_2553vq,If you have time check out jazz chords and chord structure they tend to be a lot fuller and thicker than normal chords. They do have more accidentals and are a bit more complicated and require a bit more study but is totally worth it. I play jazz on the piano and sax I find that a lot of the chord progressions and structure as well as theory apply very well to music production.

When you pitch  stretch an audio file you are literally messing with the finished data in a destructive way and repitching or stretching will cause artifacts. Harmor does not change the original sample you only change the way it reads and resynthesizes it. Imagine it like slowing down a finished song instead of going into the project and changing the tempo.The image resynthesis interprets a picture as harmonic distribution. Combined with different scaling and formant settings this can be an interesting soundsource.

Its up to you there is no right or wrong answer.Theres still a lot happening after that initial transient that gives character listen to it in the mix. Often with snare rim shots maybe the transient is too much so you let the compressor catch it and quickly release leaving a lower transient and unaffected tail.

1595106,0,t3_2cjshj,Indeed. This is why mixing really starts with arrangement. Two timbres playing the same pitch in the same octave will create serious issues while mixing unless youre intentionally layering timbres of course.An interesting example of this harmonic balance came up while I was at a deep dubstep show in NYC a few weeks ago. There were k watts of bass in a  sqft room blasting us at  dB but I could easily carry on a conversation with my girlfriend standing right next to me without yelling since almost all of the energy coming from the system was below our voices in the frequency spectrum.ETA In an interview with Tony Andrews the dude behind the FunktionOne sound systems he talks about the phenomenon I mentioned aboveWhen you really have to drive a speaker hard Andrews said the diaphragm starts to deform. You get all sorts of secondary effects happening that have nothing to do with the original. And all this if you like spurious rubbish fills up all the spaces between the originalwhat was intended with the production. In other words if you can keep it really clean and particularly really good transience then the sound stays in its packets. Its all neat and tidy and what you find is that there are spaces in between the packets of sound and people have often remarked that they can still have a conversation. Because if you pitch your voice right you can put it into the spaces.,edmproduction,cjg8edo,5,t5_2sa4x

While I was in university sometimes I would struggle so hard to balance both that in the end I had to make a decision. It took me a little longer to do university due to the fact that I would do only  or  courses every semester just so I could focus on music. Sometimes I would spend less money on necessary things like food and such yup i starved just so I could get what I needed to produce. It was very very tough and still is sometimes. Luckily lately Ive had many shows and its been much better then it used to be. I never thought I would be in Europe right now doing shows and festivals..And in all honesty the feeling of sacrificing so much and getting results is probably the best thing that can ever happen to any of us.So to put it simply some people can balance things I couldnt. So I picked music and stuck with it. You know what they say... If you dont risk it you dont get the biscuit!Just take to heart what i said earlier. NEVER GIVE UP. If you love what you do and youre risking a lot then you will make it! As long as u stick true to yourself and are good at maintaing personal relationships everything will be ok.EDIT I cant believe i forgot another thing. Its so important to have people support you nowadays.May it be family or your girlfriend or ur friends.. It just keeps you going you know? Im lucky enough to have one of the best support groups ever. You would be surprised how powerful it is to come home and have your girlfriend or family say i believe in you.,edmproduction,cjswca6,5,t5_2sa4x

Dude I love the drop is this track really creative! It has a really awesome blend of styles. I love those snare rolls you use in the background too. I think the main thing this track needs is a little more oomf in the bass range. It might just be my speakers but this track sounds really loud in the high mids which is great because it gives it that energy but I think it just needs a more balanced mix overall. I really like this though!,edmproduction,cjsyrai,2,t5_2sa4x

The second pump compressor would be a longer release and Im guessing lowermoderate gain reduction and Im guessing would mainly be used to even out the first compressor. Sometimes with high gain reduction and low release the compressor can sound distorted so the second compressor could be kinda used to even that out a bit and make it sound better not distorted.

1798489,0,t1_ck5sbwf,My take on this I like to play around with arrangement. Make a couple melodies that dont necessarily go with each other but work well and lots of instruments that sound good with the beat. I set up my sends with stuff like sidechain and and beat repeat that also go with the beat. I take a break and come back to stack everything from scratch by turning on and off layers and switching the melodies on the instruments and feel which I like better.Heres what I think is important keep taking breaks so you can come back with a fresh ear and renewed energy to get away from that zombie repetitive feeling of simply programing music. Do it over and over each time working on a new bar in the arrangement and leaving your old trials in place and finally go over it as a whole even moving the bars to see which ones transferlend their energy best to each other.I play guitar and bass and call me whatever but I dont get the same feeling of involvement playing one melody with one sound.

If you do a Group to Drum Rack with a number of samples be aware that youll be playing all those samples simultaneously  meaning additive amplitude in your track. Make sure that they are all turned down or EQd out to not conflict with one another.Additionally make sure that you adjust the Velocity Sensitivity parameter from the default  up to  so that if you have varying velocities for each sample Ableton will recognize and play them back at that level.,edmproduction,ckqh5cw,2,t5_2sa4x

1973126,0,t3_2haq0g,I cant listen to that link atm so this isnt specifically relevant to it more of a random thought about what you said about your leads being to wide or to monoish. Maybe you could try one instance of your lead set up to be the powerful centre running on one track and another instance of the same lead tweaked to be more of a wide side running at the same time on another track. That way you have wideness but a powerful centre. If you wanted you could use a MidSide EQ on each to help blend them to together and create a single sound. Anyway I would probably try something like this if I needed additional centre or sidewideness.,edmproduction,ckqyn8j,1,t5_2sa4x

Then on top of the channel settings where the gears button usually is and set a pitch range with the pitch knob and automate that by right clicking on the pitch knob and setting up an automation curve on your playlist. Hopefully that works pm me if you have any questions. ,edmproduction,ckr5goo,1,t5_2sa4x

A remixer that is capable of getting a lot of views for their own song is effective at marketing their song and at building a fan base. The winner here effectively is paid back for their marketing of their song and the original song and artist.  Basically my thought is that in this contests case at least the person whos remix isnt necessary the best but gets the biggest reaction from the crowd is identified as the winner and is the safest bet for the competition holder to promote because its a basic guarantee that the song will do well.,edmproduction,ckrxopk,1,t5_2sa4x

Most people wont take her seriously cause she looks like a supermodel and even my own sister immediatly assumed shes a fake. I would love to see more females in the industry cause no matter how much equality you want to throw around women and men ARE different and because of that difference women can have a differentnew effect on things males do but with labels hiring ghost prods.premaking mixesPR stunts etc everyone will think a women is a total fake and shouldnt even be here. I think the only way a women will be taken seriously in the industry is if she just makes dippy electrolove pop and makes drops like HE BROKE MY HEARTwubuwbuwbwuwbwub or if shes not attractive and or lesbian.Theres a female dj in my country who is going to start a dj school for females but I think thats just going to cause more equality and discrimination the only way a women will be taken seriously is if she gets to the top by herself with no labels but thats incredibly unfair its basically Ill only like you if you can fist fight  people who have gunsjust look at Martin Garrix who got so much hate for animals cause everyone thought hes no way he made that and then when he made livestreams of his production people got angrier at him for some of his methods just imagine if Martin Garrix had been a female.

2320440,0,t1_cly7ifw,I think discrimination is the wrong word. I dont think anyone is actively keeping women out of the industry through policies that outright discriminate just because of gender. I think its more that the EDM scene is built on club culture and the business model of a dance club is not conducive to getting women into the scene. I really think its just an extension of the gender roles in our society. Girls arent supposed to buy themselves drinks at clubs and clubs make their money off of drinks bottle service and tables... And that leads to the club treating the femalemale ratio as an advertisement. Whats interesting to me is that gay clubs are way different from your typical dance club. The atmosphere is entirely different and I think its because of the absence of gender roles. You dont have a business built off selling bottle service and tables to dudes so they can get girls to hang out its built off everybody buying everybody else drinks and everyone parties. Seriously even if youre straight go to a gay club. Its awesome. ,edmproduction,clyiqs8,2,t5_2sa4x

Definitely try out the demo.I got close with two saws detuned . and . with a lowpass filter no reso with as you say slightly longer attack and nice long decay.  Set up unison to  voices with just a touch of pitch spread and stereo spread to taste.  Definitely add a sub sine as a seperate layer no detuning.  FX to try are chorus and a light phaser.If you want some added warmth you can try string samples very quietly underneath as a layer to the chords.

That said i would probably spend  months without pressure to experiment get comfortable in your DAW and maybe stumble upondevelop a signature sound that you wanna adopt and perfect.

The power feature of Serum is that it allows you to import and create your own wavetables...and you can even manipulate and edit wavetables you import from other synths i.e. Massive via drawing. Even if you dont intend to go that deep Serum still has tons of different filters and effects that are totally unique to it. Kinda like the Scream Filter is to Massive.  For Serum the reverb filter and the ability to create a morphing distortion effect in the FX section are what makes it unique.  Basically you draw  wave shaper distortions and it morphs between them when you turn a knob.  Their are a few Wavetables i know inside and out from Massive that i love using both those effects on.   ,edmproduction,cm83r6b,1,t5_2sa4x

I always get stuck listening to the same loop over and over and it gets to the point where changingadding elements makes it sound off.I now map out arrangements from tracks. Not even necessarily tracks that I like but tracks with an arrangement I appreciate the. Just add blocks and channels where I hear a sound and then I can fill it in later.

2815842,0,t1_cno32mn,Well how close is yours and how did you do it? It sounds to me like a pretty basic lowpass bass patch maybe slight detuning but not much more complexity than that played on something like a classic Moog or Korg. Do you have a good virtual analog plugin? Diva? If you dont have something thats meant to do this sound it might be a little trickier depending on what you do have in your arsenal.Was that big harmonic twice the fundamental frequency an octave up or three times? A square has only odd harmonics a saw has odd and even though distortion can blur the difference. Listening again I think Im leaning toward square or maybe an asymmetric pulse which is somewhere in between but it can be nonobvious when filtered low like that and you might be able to get a clue.,edmproduction,cno5jvg,1,t5_2sa4x

2856060,0,t3_2stfzu,Honestly Worlds  the entire album  is essentially modern synthpop. Its a slightly warmer nostalgic retrowave inspired version of synthpop rather than the usual cold mechanical stylings of say Depeche Mode... But it has a lot more in common with that style of music than it does with anything else Id say.It takes aspects of synthpop french housepop think Midnight City by M and new retro wave and mashes them together. Listen to any song off the album Sometimes a modern sounding kick but aside from that drum machines galore! Flagrant tom usage mah favourite Reverb everywhere! Even gated reverb on the snare in Polygon Dust for instance. Sampled filtered guitars and basses like in Flicker wall of sound synths ala producers like Madeon THE DUCKING oh god the ducking.  bit sounds synths that sound like theyd be right at home in an old Daft Punk album GM Midi sounds like the one in Sad Machine. That all screams those genres to me.This is a similar style of music Ive been making for the last few months  around the same time as Worlds release which really motivated me to keep going with this style  but that is always how Ive always seen it. Im in the same place as you as finding out what to really label it for music consumption. Synthpop is probably the best bet or honestly even more mainstream pop to a degree but Im not sure of the labels. You can either lump it under the retrowave genre which probably is bit of a misnomer call it synthpop but thats basically used by anything that sounds electronic but doesnt fit the mould of other genres just like electronica used to be in the early s or just give it a new name feel like an awesome hipster and hope it sticks. People have asked me what I call the music I make and I jokingly call it neon pop since thats the feeling it evokes. ,edmproduction,cnsqg2u,2,t5_2sa4x

That isnt even taking in the fact on top of that you have reflections bouncing every an cant really hear to make critical choices to start compensating  for massive  dips an peaks.

3037270,0,t1_co8gpsk,Here is what I think would make the track betterFirst get a punchier kick and a snappy snare. Dubstep especially brostep is not for really beefy kicks with a sharp snare. This kind of dubstep is all about power behind your track. Your intro had power to it then the drop came and it was lost. Its not so much the arrangement but the sounds.Next you need to work on your mid wobbles. Again your intro synths sound great but these mid wobbles sounded kind of cheap. Resample them a bit or throw them through different plugins to subtly change the sound more and more. You want them so also sound powerful and very full. During the drop these wobbles and the kick and snare should be capable of filling up the song without the rest of the small stuff added in.Next watch your mixdowns. Your seperate wobble volumes were off your snare was quiet and airy. And it just didnt feel full throughout the whole thing Lots of frequency ranges were missing in the drop.The idea behind it is good even though im not a fan of this kind of dubstep just need to practice the execution of it. That comes as you make more though. ,edmproduction,coct919,1,t5_2sa4x

3074016,0,t3_2vc32b,Oh baby this is the thread Ive been waiting for. Incoming bias  Been producing with LMMS for almost  years now. A lot of people are saying it lacks in mastering and such and that is partially true but as it stands LMMS is a great fully functional DAW and not only for beginners. It obviously has full VSTi support and is as many Linux programs are a closetoperfect clone of said popular program FL. I am sorta in the same family situation as you and though I did torrent FL Studio  I actually didnt like it as much. There were many complications with external VSTs automation glitches etc. etc. possibly because I pirated it but it is a full copy so..  I might well go back to it when I get to mixing and mastering of my tracks but I found the simplicity and full functionality of LMMS to be quite worthy of praise. My advice is to use LMMS until maybe you can get a job to save for FL Ableton etc. or just.. you know... get over your issues with pirating. And who knows? You might just get to like LMMS like I do! I do know much of what there is to know about LMMS so if you need any help with functions.. HMU. Good luck! ,edmproduction,cogmbiv,6,t5_2sa4x

3092016,0,t3_2vjfnp,Hey Neo. If youre using a sawtooth wave for the LFO modulation set the destination knob the little black knob to the left of the modulation destination box to a negative value. In practice this inverts the waveform so that rather than ramping up your wave is now ramping down whatever parameter youve set as the destination. Thats what the maker of Sylenth is saying. The destination knob sets the polarity positive or negative and amount of modulation to the destination. I like to think of the destination knob as telling whatever parameter Im modulating i.e. cutoff frequency where to begin. From there the parameter follows the shape of the waveform. So if you have a sawtooth wave and set a negative destination amount you can tell that parameter to start at the peak of the sawtooth wave and then move down to the end of the waves cycle. Does that make sense?,edmproduction,coihie8,1,t5_2sa4x

3101748,0,t3_2vnu8p,First off I have not released anything major so I would not mind if you took my advice as a grain of salt. uferola I understand your problem and I am going through the exact same situation but I look at what I have to work with differently in terms of creating something instead of just listening to it. Honestly most of the time when I am using a computer to produce music it just does not feel like enough work is put in my projects to make said pieces sound professional. If you know how to use FL Studio in and out but have a hard time coming up with a clean professional track the look in the other direction when producing music. Focus on less instruments stick to the basic oscillators xOsc is the perfect example worry less about sounding professional and instead worry more about where you are working on your track. Sometimes all the pretty visual effects can lose your focus when listening to your work or keeping track with your workflow.Instead of rushing to finish a track try working in layers. What I mean by working in layers focusing on one aspect of the track at a time. For instance if you are working on your composition do not worry how that instrument sounds or the annoying twang when you hit A just focus on composition. Then work on mixing and the like and if one layer just does not sound right focus only on that layer disregarding if the other layers are clashing or annoying the crap out of you.Make sure your song has three elements when you listen over it. MetricHarmonic Contrast A constantly busy track is a boring track and almost same goes to a signal tone. Change up the amount of elements throughout the song to bring a professional feel. Groove Not all songs do need a groove but all songs have a groove. Ambient pieces have a long bassy drone while club hits and trap songs have a small short but consistent bassline. Make sure the bass area of a song between Hz is easy to follow and fills the back area of the song not too loud where it distorts other instruments but not too soft when it leaves the piece empty.. Complimentary Sound Design You have a loud airy sound in progress in your song? compliment it with a softer quieter or bassier sound to fill the song. What about fast elements? compliment and contrast that arp riff etc. with a drone pad or a string. If the fast elements are loud do the opposite for the slow ones or vice versa. This extends to MetricHarmonic contrast but make sure whatever sound you design focuses on the sound itself.Hope I can help you out.,edmproduction,cojhtq4,6,t5_2sa4x

3139000,0,t1_comyk5e,Wow this takes me back to making club tracks with my friends in tracker software... Id take each part in turn and just spice it up a little bit add some variations.  For instance you know how the bass is only on every other note like this? oooooooo  What if just towards the end it was there with the kick like this? ooooooooo With a pitch other than the chords root just for that one particular note.  I cant quite make out what the hihats doing but it sounds like just th notes all of the same velocity.  Try varying the velocity a bit within the bar before you copy and paste it then maybe even vary it again for every fourth bar something like that.  Those snare fills on all the th notes maybe remove just one or two andor add some nd notes for them just a shaveandahaircut towards the end or something.  Try adding a subtle melody to the strings rather than just playing block chords.  Not necessarily these things but something like theme just all these little flourishes that each is quite small and insignificant but the cumulative effect really adds up.  I think a bunch of minor changes like this would really liven up the track and add interest.Its already good as it is dont get me wrong but I think these details or something like them would make it that much more varied and engaging.,edmproduction,concrdd,1,t5_2sa4x

If they are you could separate them into separate audio tracks so that you can chop them up or handlemix them separately this allows you to have more freedom with it at least thats how I feel.... I usually mix them separately unless the sounds are working together i.e.  layers of synths that produce  ultimate sound.. I just master it within the same project people like Deorro and MAKJ tend to do this too. When its rendered and I have an audio file I usually run it through traktor or back into a new empty project to check how the sound wave looks and to see if the track looks balance throughout without huge peaks or really quiet parts.These are just my ways though and honestly Im not an expert at this so...,edmproduction,conyd9d,2,t5_2sa4x

You can set up the attack and release by clicking on  Env in the middle to create the envelope.  Then click on the  sign and drop it in one of the boxes underneath the cutoff knob.  You can adjust the amount of the envelope by dragging the  in the box up and down.The amp envelope is already set up as envelope .  Click on  Env to adjust those settings.With massive you have wavetable synthesis instead of straight waves.  To get sin wav you do the sinsquare or sintriangle in the oscillator and turn the wavetable knob all the way to the left for sin wave.  For pulse youd pick sinsquare and turn wavetable knob all the way to the right or squaresaw and all the way to the left.Essentially the wavetable synthesis is like using syntorial to set the first one as a square and the second one as a saw and then blending between the two with the mix knob...which is basically what the wtpos knob is doing in massive except its just using one oscillator.

The EDM track will use lots of highend noise to give it excitement whereas Burial is generally attenuating those similar frequencies. So while the songs are the same BPM they have a completely different energy to them because of the noise or lack of noise.Use this same principal to provide interesting contrast and movement throughout your song reducing noise and then reintroducing for excitement where you want it etc.,edmproduction,coraofq,1,t5_2sa4x

Ive never had a problem with the audio. I can throw just  PSP Vintage warmer on a Massive bass and it throws my macro automation out of whack....throw on another rd party VST and it makes it even worse. I for one want Ableton to FINALLY be forced to fix this crap so until then Im done withem. Logic Pro Xs latest update took care of pretty much all of the issues I had with it.

Render out all tracks as soon as youre done editing without the sidechain and create a mixdown project where you can use as many LFOTools as you want. This will help with cpu as well.Ableton should add a feature that allows us to freeze a track to a certain point in the signal flow. Eveything will be frozen until a plugins with sidechain is in the way. So a track can be half frozen.Or freezing a track should also read sidechain signals while rendering  rendering both at the same time.,edmproduction,covkcil,1,t5_2sa4x

The sound card isnt doing any processing its just taking the audio from the processor and converting it to analog. You could increase your sampling rate to try and cut down latency. It sounds like your problem isnt anything in your system so throwing money at it wont fix anything. The other thing to remember is those converters are used for professional situations where you need many inputs and outputs I use the FireFace there at work because its hooked up to a  channel mixer. Otherwise its pretty pointless to try and save latency by dropping a couple grand on both the converters and the onboard sound card because you need one of those too!. ,edmproduction,cp86z85,1,t5_2sa4x

It may be something you have to work up to but..I use Logic Pro X.I import a reference track.Align the beginning of the track to ... theres a feature which will set the tempo to match the reference track so that the grid in Logic matches up perfectly.  wont go into that now I create a track for every sound I hear in the reference song.I create a region for every performance that changes on an instrument. Like Baseline pattern change or Chord change etc.Also try to describe the sounds I hear. If know how the sound is made Ill describe what it is sawtooth with some filter or loads of reverb on snare etc..Logic provides a notes field for each track so I can keep a careful record of exactly what sounds I hear.So once Ive mapped out an entire track I like to delete the reference track then try and reproduce the arrangement but with my own sounds and performances. I deliberately try to not make a copy of the original songs melodies and beats but try and use only the empty regions I created to house the parts for the song.When its done I sometimes end up with a new original song. I almost always toss these out. But they are really good exercises to keep your arrangement skills sharp.Most people in the art world call this deconstruction.,edmproduction,cpsbxa2,15,t5_2sa4x

3605075,0,t3_31jrwh,The key for me was getting visual feedback. Thats why I prefer the ableton compressor. It has a nice UI that shows you exactly what its doing and its pretty easy to see how you are affecting the sound.As far as understanding what each setting is doing... you need to stop overlooking what each variable actually is saying. Threshold is called threshold for a very specific reason. If you dont start really trying to understand what each of these settings actually means youll end up having to relearn them each time you open up a compressor to do something you havent done before. At least this was the case for me.Its also helpful to remember that compression is not for making a sound louder its actually the opposite. The idea is to make the sound softer. There are tons of tricks with compression though but if you start with the tricks you will probably not really understand the fundamental behavior of the tool and in doing so miss out on opportunities where compression could have saved your ass.As for more practical advice... Try getting some raw snare samples and compressing them. The difference between a real snare recording and a well compressed snare can bet incredible and satisfying. Sometimes trying to play around with things outside of the context of a track can be a lot more useful than trying to learn in context.,edmproduction,cq37da4,1,t5_2sa4x

3607222,0,t3_31nueu,The classical way to do it is to set up the key change with a secondary dominant chord. That just means you end your phrase in the original key on the dominant chord of the next key. For example if youre in C and you want to go to G you can set it up by preceding the G chord with a D major chord. You can move to the D smoothly from an A minor or C major chord iiV or IVV in G. In those cases the chord before the secondary dominant is called a pivot chord which lets  you set up the key change within the original progression making it seamless. Its easier the closer the key is adding a sharp is the same as modulating to the key of the fifth and adding a flat is modulating to the key of the fourth. You can really go all out with this shit and make your entire progression cascading key changes which was a popular compositional style in the th century. ,edmproduction,cq3g6pm,4,t5_2sa4x

However its no coincidence that because this tech allows so many nonmusicians to make stuff theres a surge of minimaleffort music.Normally the argument against this would be let the shitty producers be shitty their music wont become popular anyway and theyll learn to be better by experience etc but genres like Big Room and to a lesser extent brostep show that listeners dont always weed out the unskilled.I too feel frustrated that most of the very popular EDM is distinctly lacking in musicality but its the same way prog metal fans feel about metalcore and theres kinda nothing you can do.,edmproduction,cq4vo1c,6,t5_2sa4x

For example I keep the bass super high on my  monitors to make sure its clear for big boomy sound systems most people would say Im insane but it works for me.Probably best advice I can give though is dont get caught up on bass. You are much more likely to decide its weak compared to it being overpowered so keep that in mind.

3677355,0,t1_cqap1sl,This is really good for someone only a month in! Some points to improve on that havent been said The drops kind of sound like you recorded someone playing this song in a tunnel. Sounds like the overall reverb is pretty wet which isnt a problem but it helps to cut the lows out of the reverb signal on drums and basses it keeps things from getting too muddy. This might just be personal preference but I wanted the leads in the drops to really hit and be present. It helps to sidechain the lead with its reverb signal you can find Youtube tutorials on this this keeps the lead from drowning in reverb. Also maybe try some saturation and compression on the lead too. Sounds like youre really lacking some of the real high frequencies that add air to a track try checking out whats going on in your  kHz range  sometimes some basic white noise will even do the trick.Like I said great job for your skill level though!

Example You fuckin love the snare sound in your tune. You love it so much you solo it for  hours and masturbate. When you unsolo it you notice that you can hear the transient but you cant hear that sexy tail youve been masturbating too for the last  hours. Now your limp. You try adjusting the levels of everything else but you still cant fuckin hear that snare tail that gets you off!!!! GOD DAMNIT!!! Then you remember HA HA! I CAN CONTROL DYNAMIC RANGE WITH A COMPRESSOR!! You get a chubby. you place a compressor on your snare track with a longer attack time so you dont affect the transient. Youre getting harder. You set your threshold low so you compress the FUCK outta that snare tail. Now increase the output gain and BAM! You nutted. You can hear the tail of your snare through the mix!

3802191,0,t1_cqpmt3p,Tracks that are way off in terms of spectral balance are never fun. Also if a kick drum or snare is buried its hard to get a good master and I often end up asking my client to revise the mix a bit. To more simply convey my point just make sure the mix is good before mastering. Any mastering engineer worth their salt will tell you if your mix needs to be revised before taking your money. As far as making my life easier dont worry about where your song is peaking as long as theres no clipping  we can just turn the volume up or down before mastering and if any engineer tells you thats incorrect find a new one. Obvious exceptions would be when working with recorded audio where the noise floor becomes an issue but this is edmp and with digital audio in  bit it doesnt matter. ,edmproduction,cqpohjp,22,t5_2sa4x

I feel like the crowd noises are fine and at  it repeats a total of four times. any shorter of a repetition would either sound awkward  or it just wouldnt be satisfying .Also i feel like this track was supposed to sound eeriecreepyoffputting so the bass note at  sounding melancholic doesnt really seem like an issue to me. Again thats all personal preference.As for the four on the floor eh. I dont mind that either. He uses it primarily for builds in this track anyways so its not like its the center piece of the track in any aspect.And the ending is my favorite part. I like how its not typical trap and it sort of just comes out of no where. That seems like his sort of style and if thats what he wants to do then by all means he should. As long as its executed well. If people stick to genre guidelines completely there would never be any variation and there would be little room for creativity.

My suggestion would be to DL the trial of each and see what looks the most comfortable.In my opinion I use Ableton there was a pretty big learning curve though and it took a long time of looking up YouTube videos reading some guides and playing around with it to finally grasp how to get around inside of it.Anyways at the end of the day the best for you is the one you feel the most comfortable with.

Maybe youre just being kind.Look obviously these guys and gals are successful because they are great at what they do. Im not knocking it. Maybe generic is the wrong term because to some it denotes cheapness. What I mean is that its a general class of sounds that a producer generally has to attain to be considered popular. Thats all Im saying. Im curious how many talented producers leave behind what they love doing to meet this general criteria to gain fame. Of course theres a fine art and a lucrative one at that to meet this general criteria. My point is that once the criteria is met it seems a certain uniqueness is eschewed. But it is true that within the confines of music there is only so much creativity available to a producer within those constraints and yet you must remain listenable to grow your popular status.I wasnt trying to say Im any good at all or that I hold a grudge against any success somebody might have. Im still fairly new at this and trying to get feedback about the process and the profession. Peace.,edmproduction,crdrj0x,1,t5_2sa4x

So in this case I would not call the new song original even though it mostly is.In general if Im reusing a distinctive part hook melody arguably vocals then Ill label it a remix.

Turn the cutoff almost all ht way up not quite all the way dont want it to be a super bright sound and turn the resonance about halfway up. . Set an envelope to control just the cutoff of the sound. Make it stabbysounding. . If you need to boost the low end a bit. Also play around with different distortions to the sound to make it different. . Sidechain the bass. You dont want the bassline and kick clashing in the low end. It causes clipping and overall tends to not sound to well. . Add a bit of reverb to the sound just make sure the reverb isnt on the low end. It fills out the track when you do this and makes it sound deeper.,edmproduction,crlmhtg,1,t5_2sa4x

4201843,0,t3_38ymt2,I would recommend analyzing some of your favourite melodies and seeing whats going on in them. I would start by figuring out the key of the song which will give you the basic palette of notes to guide the melody and go from there. I think youll find that more often that not notes that are used from out of the scale are usually passing tones to other notes in the scale and arent lingered on for very long or are used intentionally to create dissonance. After youve analyzed some melodies youll want to look at doing chord progressions and seeing how the melody interacts with the chords being played. Are chord tones being used to form an arpeggio in the melody or are other notes being used too? Often times a simple melody can take on a more complex sound when paired with an accompanying harmony. ,edmproduction,crz7ac9,1,t5_2sa4x

Its been a long time since I added to my sample library so I dont have much advice besides Google download throw out the shit samples and keep the useful ones.I typically have one or two reverb tracks. For your purpose I think you should try . one large bright hall and . one with a shorter tail for sounds in the back of the mix.The large one is for things you want to sound loud route your snares and synths through this one at a very low volume. You should only just hear it with headphones on. This suggests to your ears that the sounds are loud enough to reach faraway walls and come back.The smaller one is for shoving things back in the mix your thnote hihat pattern would get a lot of this as would background texture synths that you dont want to compete with the wubs but rather fill out the sides.Id give the vocals their own chain.gtSomeone on the WATMM feedback said they should be quieterMaybe they were listening with a subwoofer and your sub is too loud.

Get yourself a synth with an arpeggiator on it and turn on portamento set the octave on the arp to  then modulate it up over the course of  bars or so.This creates this cool swelling sound particularly when you combine it with filtersresonance rising as well as having the potential for a lovely cascade back down if you so desire...

If they need an orchestra to realize their vision or a virtuoso guitar lick or something along those lines they can just GET one now. They dont need to sample a funk song. They can hire session musicians and record one from scratch. They can afford to spend a ton of money to record an album because they have it or their track record suggests that the album will probably sell so they can justify the expense to their label. When they made their iconic samplebased work they didnt have that luxury. They had to make do with what they had. I really dont see there being less sampling in general.

4341475,0,t1_csems2n,I agree with uStopDaydreaming about the snare at . The rhythm makes me lose track of where the beginning of each bar is. Its just slightly off time which can work for accents but at that point the synth is so soft that the snare is the only thing maintaining the beat and it feels weird being out of sync. As for the bassy parts Im wondering if it might be worth combining the sub and the kick as is done in a lot of trap. Basically rather than have a sub and a kick just having a kick with a really long and suby kick. You already basically do that at  by having the kick hit every time the sub does but I think the earlier section  could benefit from that same cohesion and more importantly I think the bass could use a bit of a tail. You could replace the off beat kick hits with a tom if necessary. The synth at  needs to be a big louder. I think the bass could be a bit softer during the  section and that section itself goes on a little too long imo. Theres some low metallic sounding reverby resonance during the final drop at . Id EQ that a bit so it sits in the background more. Overall the the track is pretty danklove the rubber duck like samples.,edmproduction,csf0jfu,1,t5_2sa4x

4471178,0,t1_csu8ccq,I looked into this a bit more and I think I was somewhat offbase  and not in the direction youd hope. That  dB   figure? The number that looks like that is more often a dBmW sensitivity rating than a maximum output.I havent checked that this is correct but if you assume it is and take the assumption from here that actual output voltage is proportional to the square of volume level you are probably edit more like possibly depending out the voltage output of your device but most consumerportable phones are designed to get loud at low voltage actually listening a ways above  dB and would have to turn way down to reach . By this estimation I may be at  remember dB are logarithmic myself here listening at  notches with fairly loud and low impedance headphones on a Macbook. Sorry. If youre using a portable device the amp output may be lower though.This isnt remotely my area of expertise.edit more conservative rules say each dB above  db cuts permissible listening time in half if  dB is  hours. Less conservative say more like dB. These are all from public healthoccupational exposure standards  Im not sure what sort of break is considered appropriate between exposures or what sort of hearing damage is expected after x minutes at y dB. It probably varies a lot for different people so this is just a ballpark idea of whats sustainable for most people.,edmproduction,csu9kp8,2,t5_2sa4x

4485706,0,t3_3cixbe,Yeah I think volume would be a great place to start. Also you want to be using a shaker sample not hihats to make it sound like the example. Take a shaker sample roll off a bit of high end with an EQ and create  audio tracks. Let the first track have the shaker playing the  hits. The second track playing the other  hits so they are both playing th notes together. The shaker sample on the first track should be different to the shaker sample on track  a good thing to do would be to make sure the shaker on track  is a deeper pitch than track . I would also add a very soft hi hat playing at the same time as the shaker on track . With track  let this be the quietest track with a shaker hitting just slightly after the shaker on track . Just have this on loop and adjust the position of the samples on track  gradually to the right. If you want me to give you more explanation let me know.,edmproduction,csw34wd,1,t5_2sa4x

4682633,0,t3_3f2o1y,Depends on how the plugins effects sound and what kind of processing Im doing on the sound. Usually Ill take the VSTs effects off and remake them so I can use it as a send or decide where in the chain I want it. For instance if the VST preset youre using has delay and reverb on it and you compress it youll end up compressing those reverb and delay tails as well however if you remake the delay and reverb you can stick them in wherever you want in the chain. On the other hand some VSTs such as serum and spire have some really nice sounding effects. In this case Ill either keep the end processing in mind when Im making the sound so Im able to keep the VST effects from getting muddled by additional processing or I will duplicate the synth and make one completely dry and the other one I turn the effects completely wet this only works if they function as inserts rather than sends and use one as my clean sound and one as a fauxsend track. ,edmproduction,ctksix4,0,t5_2sa4x

4721838,0,t3_3flg70,You are taking this by the wrong end. You need to start top down not bottom up. You really shouldnt start by trying to learn complex synthesis like FM or even how to create your own drum samples. Take it one step at a time. You should try to learn one step at a time in this chronological order  . Simple remix. Take a song you like and simply try to make it a bit different. Add a drum here and there cut and paste some parts add some effects. Dont bother with new synths or mixing or mastering. One step at a time.. Advanced remix. Take a song you like but this time try to add a new drop by creating your own drum patterns and adding some synths. Dont bother with synthesis for now use sample packs and presets even famous producers do it all the time. Still no need to worry about mixing and mastering.. Finished remix. Take a remix from step  but this time try to mix and master it. Try to make it sound like any other official release on Beatport and understand where to put each sound.. Simple track. Now is the time to make your first original track. Start simple use presets and sample packs. Look up some simple chord patterns and remake videos of your favourite tracks. The goal here is not to make the next summer anthem but to make from start to finish a basic song. . Advanced track. Once again try to make an original track but this time try to fiddle with the presets or even make your own from scratch. Try modifying samples or even creating your own with synthesis. Try to come up with a cool chord progression and melody. Make a fully original track. . Finished track. Take a complete track from step  but this time really focus on every detail  intro outro mixing mastering song structure FXes maybe vocals. Aim for your track to be releasable on Beatport. Obviously going from step  to  will take time. My personal journey with music started six years ago. I first started DJing then about  years ago started producing. During the first year I spent most of my time watching tutorials about producing and FL Studio. I watched an astonishing amount of videos countless hours. I also did thousands of small loops parts half songs without ever finishing anything for months. It is a very frustrating and hard process but you can make it. Deadmau got famous after more than  years of producing dont give up. Making music at a professional level is not an easy goal. Like every craft it takes years of practice to master the art. Despite the few geniuses who release tracks at  for most of us it will takes years to achieve anything close to professional. Being a music producer means being very good at sound design audio engineering and music theory. It can feel overwhelming at times but it is very rewarding once you start being able to do whatever you want. Dont give up ! PS  always remember  golden rules . If you cant do it Google it.. If you still cant do it try again.. If you still cant do it find another way.. If you really cant do it see step .,edmproduction,ctpq6lh,1,t5_2sa4x

4734048,0,t1_ctr26xy,I havent listened to psytrance in a long time so some of this may be off the mark genrewise. Your bass is eating up a lot of space and you could push everything else a bit harder if you turn it down a bit. If youre worried about it not standing out enough you could also layer it with more of a midbass lower in the mix. From  onwards sounds good but I think  and  you could add in some automation or some arpsleads mixed really low in the mix to keep things interesting and give the track lots of movement. I also think it fits the genre a bit if you were more liberally with your effects use. Automate the drywet on a delay to increase with a short decay time so you get a really wet slapback sound or throw a flanger on with low wetness and decrease the rate on it to really get it whirling around as you approach a transition. I really like your sound design in this song everything is nice and crisp and I like the formant sound youre getting on your leads. ,edmproduction,ctr9p9a,1,t5_2sa4x

4849105,0,t3_3h8p46,Basically youre talking about signal flow. How it works is say youve got a synth on a channel. When you play something in the synth lets say it puts out a signal level thats at db. That signal then goes through whatever plugins are on the channel then through the fader on the channel. If you have your fader on the channel set to db the level of the signal at this point is now db. The signal then goes to your master and from there it comes out your speakers.        However at any point in this chain you can add or take away volume either in the synth by turning the synths volume up and down changing parameters in the synth or adding plugins. For example if you crank up the volume in the synth you might be adding say  db of gain for exaple. This means that even though you have the channel fader set to db your channel will be peaking above this at db and a signal thats at db is what will be sent to the master.         The reason to have your faders set to db is just so that when all your sounds get to the master their combined volume doesnt make the master go above db and cause clipping. Individual channels CAN go above db prefader BUT if you were to render that channel to audio you would have clipping.        Best practice? Just make sure your individual channel levels dont go past their fader position db and make it so the loudest channels fader sits no higher than db.    ,edmproduction,cu5rkc5,1,t5_2sa4x
4849802,0,t1_cu5kbix,Hey! Im fairly new to EDM but Ive been writing melodic poprock for many years now so this might be something I can comment a little better on than the production.The underlying melody is nice but the lead that starts at  is alright but there are points in it that could be changed.The lead could be simpler in this case not saying that the lead is complicated though and it always depends on what is happening under it. When you construct lead lines you could think of it as constructing vocal lines. Then if you want to make them more complicated you can work it out from the simple vocal line you created.Im thinking about this more like I would write a melodic poprock song. It usually start by me stumbling upon a lead and a instrumental that fit together be it a chorus verse bridge... ill figure that out later. The lead being a voice in this case is always rather simple but it along with the instrumental behind it has to create something I like before I continue. After that I might create a pinao line mimicin the singing and make it more complex. It has happend also that Ive liked lead line I created so much that I replace it for the voice.But the method I just described above works for me but different methods might work for others.,edmproduction,cu5uq5c,1,t5_2sa4x

I know that I can program a scale into my piano roll and move it up or down through the octaves and it will still be correct. But I still want to choose the right scale before I start building all my sounds.The way I usually make a song is  I make a bass synth and when I get a simple bass melody that I like I figure out which scales it fits into and build the melodies and sounds with all my other synths using whichever one of those scales I think has the right feeling to it.I mostly do build my own chords but sometimes being able to preview a bunch of chords that fit in my scale using an app lets me find the ones that are missing. If I sit there playing around with chords the song usually goes stale and never gets finished.I might be being stupid but I still dont understand how C Major is a good place to start any song other than songs in major key obviously... Maybe its just because I make most of my music in minors and random exotic scales.And yeah stop driving and texting dude... that really is a bad idea!,edmproduction,cuqd9dq,2,t5_2sa4x

Learning harmonic theory is actually MORE important for this style of music. Playing a saw wave spanning  octaves and making it sound in harmony is pretty straight forward. Making  different sounds sound like  chord without creating muddiness requires much more knowledge of the individual sounds such as where their fundamental frequencies fall and how much harmonic content they have.

5274552,0,t3_3n82o5,Make sure your samples are cropped well. Zoom in close in SamplerSimpler and have them start at the beginning of the first waveform or whatever sounds best to you.  When you layer a lot of things to fire at once watch out for interference. This could explain some things. EQ well to avoid those distortions.  I always program to the grid then move my clapssnares slightly off. I like to move the clap ahead a few ms and the snare behind a few ms. It creates drive and groove and the body of your snare can resonate with less interference from the kick if you want that.  Play with velocity. Make sure velocity affects your sample somehow either by modulating the volume or filter.  There are tons and tons of things you can do. Drum programming isnt simple. Far far from it. Many Alist producers cite in interviews that when they arent feeling inspired to work on a track they try to improve their drum programming and sound design skills.,edmproduction,cvlvtz4,2,t5_2sa4x

5337163,0,t1_cvtozw0,Similar in the sense of being multiband but a compressor and a gate do two entirely different things.You can think of a compressor as something like a device that keeps turning the volume knob down every time a signal gets too hot. It makes the loudest sounds a little quieter and the softer sounds a little louder. Essentially it narrows the distance between the loudest and quietest sounds. After it does that then a compressor usually has another volume setting at the end of the chain which is commonly turned up a bit so that everything is a little louder. A multiband compressor does this independently for different frequency bands bass mid treble for example.A gate is something that turns the volume OFF after a certain time or after the amplitude of a signal has fallen below a certain threshold. A multiband gate does this independently for different frequency bands bass mid treble again for example. Listening to the example linked in the OPs post carefully and you should be able to hear what the gate is doing.,edmproduction,cvtvr56,3,t5_2sa4x

5358651,0,t1_cvwle8p,Sounds  It might just be difference is music tastes but I thought the piano couldve been a little less vanilla. My favourite sound was the lowerpitched synth in the chorus.Dynamics  There is too much of a noticeable difference in volume between the verse and chorus. Use more compression or start using it if you havent yet. Although a better fix would be to work on the levels.Buildup  Doesnt create enough tension which makes the chorus feel not as strong as it could be. I would add more elements. I noticed you have an automated cut in both the main chorus synths low end and the drums. It actually works counterintuitively to what a buildup is supposed to be.Mix  The main synth in the chorus needs to be tuned down. For the verse I know you wanted the piano to be the main focus but it sounds really empty as it is. The background synths and plucks can be turned up to make the verse sound fuller and a small cut in the mids can help them from becoming too prominent. For your future mixes I think you shouldnt focus too much on forcing the listener to listen to the main element. It should be strong enough but dont forget about the background noises too. Your chorus was your strongest section.Edit After rereading this I think I may have came off a little harsh. Of course making a song for the first time in a new genre isnt going to be perfect but this was a solid first try. I actually checked out your other stuff and honestly its quite a difference good kind of difference! Dont be discouraged ,edmproduction,cvwmmhc,1,t5_2sa4x

Theres no shortage of examples of technically flawless tracks that nobody wants to hear. You can write a total piece of dog shit gain stage it perfectly make the drums punchy make the vocals pop glue every bus leverage every psychoacoustic phenomenon in the book and master the result tastefully loud. Its still shit. You can also copypaste an arrangement pattern or chord progression into your track that works amazingly in some other track and not so much in your own. It seems like most of this community is invested in reducing composition and arrangement to one of those lego sets where you can use the same pieces to make one of the  models shown on the box.

5453329,0,t3_3pr4ua,Aside from octaves and such that people have already mentioned I would say the most noticeable difference between Japanese songs and particularly English ones would be how the words bounce off the notes. Japanese words in songs can be broken up or stretched in different ways than English ones. This is mostly because of the well defined syllables. Look at the word aishiterulit.  I love you. You can say it in a way that sounds like its composed of anywhere from three to five syllables without sounding too unnatural in a song. I think that the result is that the use of staccato is more common in the melodies. It might be easy to tell if you listen to some Rie Fu. Shes fluent in both Japanese and English and a lot of her songs use both so when shes singing in English even though she doesnt have an obvious accent and all of the lyrics are as comprehensible as any other song you can still tell its Jpop. I think Jpop artists like T.M. Revolution or Aikawa Nanase exemplify this fairly well. If you listen to any of Zuns compositions even though theyre instrumental also reflect this.

Better fix it in the mix.Quick tip to get your masters going Turn it up until you can audibly hear distortion regardless of if your meter says youre clipping or not then back off until you dont hear it distort anymore. After that add some glue compression with dB makeup adjust the threshold so its hitting the GR at around dB with a mix of about  making the needle dance nicely. Then put it through a limiter with dB gain.Should come out loud and clean and sound gelled.Hope that helps!,edmproduction,cwqijn6,2,t5_2sa4x

Anyway yes there is a sub for this but it isnt really active. I kinda forgot the name tbh but someone will probably post it in a bit.Then you could check out vocalists on social medias e.g. Soundcloud and message them. Or on forums like Reddit looperman etc. I think there are even websites that are dedicated to finding producers or vocalists. There are alot of ways. Then ofcourse you can also pay for vocals Fiverr for example. Just dont forget to tell then exactly what you want and send them a preview of your track. Theres less chance they will do it if they have to message you back asking for details and such. Also having lyrics yourself so they dont have to write them is a plus.

When the masking is backwards the masking sound comes milliseconds after the masked sound. When the masking and masked sounds come at the same time masking is simultaneous.Upward spread of masking is lowfrequency sounds masking highfrequency sounds.

Its weird cause when doing that you are actually keenly aware of the learning curve having gone through it before. When drawing its less of what do I do and more of I need to do this shading here now how do I do it. It definitely teaches you to open your daw with a sketch of the song you want. Literally. Draw out the length of it and write notes along it based on what youre thinking about hum out how you imagine itll go. Then like drawing break it all down into stages.  Undersketch lineart filling in color lighting shading background sparkles and then final polish.

At  when youre talking about inharmonicity good rule of thumb is thisfundamental  fharmonic  fharmonic  fharmonic  ff  .ff  .ff  .fBorrowed this from the sound on sound all synth secrets on snare synthesis where they did a similar thing but were looking at using frequency shifters to get those extra harmonics in analog rather than with a nice digital synth...But I found if you use those ratios to start and generate via AMRM or clever waveshaping spectrums off those frequencies you get some good results. Using nothing but those frequencies and a noise generator with the envelope squaredcubedquarticd on each harmonic as both amplitude and pitch you get some cool stuff. Try it out its a good starting point instead of spending all that time messing around with frequency values to find what youre going for.

5959234,0,t3_3x0aq2,Well the envelope shaping is definitely important in those types of percussive synths obviously you want low attack and low sustain and adjust the decay pretty low to taste. But they often have either an envelope or lfo hooked up to pitch control  or  octaves up too sorta like how you synthesize a kick drum. That helps give it that here I am attacky presence. But I think a lot of it has to do with the sound design in the initial patch. If you take a real thick or distorted enough sound and add these settings to it with a narrow enough bandwidth enough to tell theres at least some sort of pitch movement the final product is going to sound pretty strong. Lots of times they just distort a sine or triangle wave but dont be afraid to try some crazy wave tables like your first example. In that mefjus song and in LRAD they both have real long reverb tail settings but the reverb isnt too loud and is heavily compressed. It helps to accentuate the attack of the percussive synth and goves the track a nice reverb floor. Keeping the synth patch very mono is a good idea since percussion samples are often mono. A little bit of dimension expander and haas effect wouldnt hurt. Add stereo fx to send channels of possible as to not weaken the dry synth. Both speakers playing the same signal at the same time is where the true power comes from. I think Ive gotten deep enough into this post to where I lightweight forgot what you initially asked haha hope this helps a bit!Edit another tip I forgot to mention in regards to processing. Try sending your dry synth and all fx to a group channel with either a compressor or a saturator. This will obviously squash the signal a bit but since everything is grouped the dry signal will remain dominant since the compressor will turn down everything at once and it will help bring out all the fx and fit the sound better in the mix. unless of course you dont need it and it sounds great with all its preserved dynamics but Id bet that all  examples were either compressed or saturated in a similar manner. ,edmproduction,cy0sbhw,2,t5_2sa4x

6025812,0,t1_cy8qkjm,So much this.  I spent my s working as a recording engineer.  When I started I was voracious for any information that could improve my mixes.  I was reading and practicing my craft at least  hours a day each and every day and talked myself into an apprenticeship and then gigs at several studios in the city I was in.  The reality is the time I put is what really made a difference.  You can learn all of the techniques youd like but there is no substitute with a familiarity with how music is supposed to sound.  The context is EVERYTHING in a mix so knowing how to relate parts to other parts really comes down to your own aesthetic for what good sounds like.  The more time you spend listening and focusing on music on what makes it work and what is effective the better your ear will become.  Good mixing requires an auditory attention to detail that I think most people struggle to develop.  Unfortunately at least for me it is now pretty much impossible for me to turn off that training and just appreciate music for the art of it.  In fact I have difficulty even telling if I enjoy something beyond how well it was executed. If a mix was well recorded sounds like a cohesive whole and maybe plays with conventions in a spot or two I will generally like it.  I have no idea anymore if the song is good or not.The truth is there are no real shortcuts to developing good taste.  You just have to dive in and spend time on it.Now I rarely get more than an hour a night for music.  I switched industries as the reality of working out of others studios became less and less viable and then collapsed in .  The training is still there though and often times I can tell not only what techniques were used for most mixes but even particular pieces of equipment and rough settings if the gear used has a distinct sound.  It drives my friends wife and myself bonkers frankly as I cant seem to resist telling everyone about what was used when I hear it.  This all comes from a decade of obsession with that sound and learning to really hear all of the details of what was going on when I heard it.I wish I could unlearn everything though.  Its a real bummer missing the forest for the trees.,edmproduction,cy9i7ju,3,t5_2sa4x

In a daw you can do this artificially by treating one take with different compressioneffects etc. As for tools that can alter a performance in a daw there are a few plugins that can randomise velocity and such.

6107665,0,t1_cyjuusj,I just make sounds and use them in my tracks Ive never tried to recreate a sound from ear before. I just mess with knobsbuttons I might not have used previously. Ive had a lot of help from tutorials whether its a how to make a synth or how to make artist name here type beat video. I copy a lot of the stuff I see and do it in multiple tracks so that it sticks in my brain and I understand what Im doing. I find that when you understand what each filter does and you can actually hear the difference sound design becomes a lot easier. I mostly stick to one VST Sylenth so I would suggest watching a vid that uses the VST youre trying to learn. If youre only comfortable on one oscillator just make leads or risers. When you understand enough to effectively use two oscillators make pads or lush synths to make full sounding chords.Hope that helps!,edmproduction,cyjvnoj,1,t5_2sa4x

Just like Stradivarius  which was not chosen to have any particular sound quality advantages when tested in a blind study  We dont need people making any assumptions based on what daw people use that kind of discourse is just gonna give noobies the wrong idea. I never intended to say there should be flair based on genre  although it would be more helpful than DAW based flair  People just need to be able to focus on the music and any aspect of it. More helpful flair would be somehow showing experience or whether or not that person has had any commercial releases.  once again I see the potential issues with this idea too  At Least this way people would know whether or not the person giving advice is worth listening to.I dont know if youve noticed but the amount of dogmatic misinformation given on this subreddit is actually atrocious. ,edmproduction,cz6bg51,3,t5_2sa4x

6330168,0,t1_cz31s5n,I think the first portion up until the supersets sounds solid. The supersaws could be wider and more prominent as Id imagine youre looking to boost the energy of the track. Id consider a little distortion MS EQing for stereo effect adding more mids for powerpresence and potentially a separate mid layer with only a few voices. The drop has a lot of sub in it. Id consider lowering your sub levels and adding a mid synth layer since your current supersaws are wider and dont drive in the middle if that makes any sense.If youre going for a progressivetrance vibe then the long breakdown works fine. I personally prefer EDM so its a little drawn out for me. Vocals either chopped up or normal would work really well during the breakdown. A lot of trance artists use drawn out vocals with a lot of reverb to add a human element but still slow down the pace. Stereo image and EQ is pretty solid in my mind. Bells are a nice touch in the second drop. Sound design is good as is the overall arrangement outside of the long breakdown just for my preferences. Plenty of people like longer breakdownsThe reverb on the drop is solid. Really get the nice atmospheric big drop feel. On the master I think either a parallel compression across the entire mix or parallel compression on your key elements would really help the track pop. Overall the track is looking good. With minor adjustments on the mix along with a little layering on the supersaw I think youre good to go.,edmproduction,cz965ey,1,t5_2sa4x

Sometimes on purpose I.E. early Boys Noize having a lot of bit crushing vs. recent Boys Noize EP being entirely analog.McCartney also spoke about how part of each albums sound was their discovery of new techniques. They purposely restricted themselves from using post effects on Let It Be because they felt they were getting too detached from the playing.

Your lead just overpowers everything which is fine but I want to hear the other elements of the track as well. Composition wise the first  minutes are fine but after that it just feels like the same song playing twice. It gets kind of boring.

6423095,0,t1_czjkzom,Hey man  Very nice intro really really great guitar riff. The static noise could definitely go down in level so it sits better in the mix as a very subtle background element. Its a bit distracting at the moment. Really interesting switch up at . The mood really changes in a creepydark way and it sounds awesome. Well done. Buildup is awesome too. Good building of tension. Really awesome drop too. Drums sit really tightly in the mix. Snare is on point. The sub bass is maybe a little too distorted I feel like it muddies up the mix a bit. Some weird ass sounds in this tune but its really fitting for the overall vibe of the song. Your high end could maybe be a little more crisp the hi hats sound a little messy a bit more clarity wouldnt hurt. The track is definitely interesting and not boring at all.

6554856,0,t1_czx2bmj,Ok I listened to your track. It sounds pretty well mixed to me and the sound design is pretty good. The beat is also nice it has a lot of bounce and groove. However it seems a bit boring arrangement wise. There isnt much variation in the energy of the track there arent any breaks or calm sections the beat just keeps going on and on. I feel like you could make the key sections of the track more powerful by creating buildups to them it should add a lot more energy to the track. Also while the sound design is good it feels a bit monotone to me I think that some One shot SFX and extra highpitch instruments in certain parts would add more life to the track.Overall its a good track but the arrangement is pretty boring imo,edmproduction,czxbq4f,1,t5_2sa4x

If you give a guy a Gibson SG Standard at face value its going to sound like a Gibson SG Standard. The notes EQ and effects change per song but its the same basic instrument.In the case of playing individual drum samples like an instrument its really the sequencing and mixing that still make them your own. Unless you really want to take the time to get a mic and record your own hitsloops and synthesize your own drums to get the same results its a pretty good option to just use the instruments others have produced for you.

It does get overwhelming learning something new but eventually you have to learn to figure things out for yourself.Im not great at production but Ive learned a lot by just researching and reading and doing. I also taught myself programming and have a successful career at it I think going through that has made it easier to learn other stuff on my own because people are quick to tell you to read the docs or google it if its common knowledge you dont know. I dont think telling people to google shit means youre telling them to fuck off really just that if they wanna get anywhere with anything in life they need to learn to learn on their own. Now if you have a specific question after that go ahead and ask. But there are too many threads that could be easily answered if they spent the time posting and waiting for replies just researching on their own and it makes this subreddit basically useless to anyone with more than  months experience outside the occasional free sample pack links.,edmproduction,d03bks2,1,t5_2sa4x

If you want to keep it Id suggest playing with the panning of the conga sample as its pretty much in the center while the other elements are bouncing around in the stereo field.

6724147,0,t1_d0e7i6t,The skill in music making is about being able to get results and being able to elicit emotions out of the listener. So you want to make your own timbres because they feel more personal? Are you not able to find things that resonate with you if you dont mess with them? All I see is a lot of technicians wanting artistic merit for their technical ability. Well no. Thats not music. And honestly nobody gives a fuck about how you make your music at the end of the day. It can be a cool fact and it can gain you some respect but when people are dancing to your music in the dancefloor nobody gives a fuck. It has no value. ABSOLUTELY no value to anyone but yourself.What does have value is your judgement. Who cares if you put  effects on some high hats if at the end of the day you actually made them sound worse. The only thing that really has value is your ability to listen and to make judgements based purely on your listening. ,edmproduction,d0eu2q4,3,t5_2sa4x

6920153,0,t1_d0zpxe5,I agree with NotSoSiniSter in that a side chain on your synths attached to your kick would definitely give your mix more energy. Also during your drops the claps are spread out well but the high end of your synths are masking the crispiness of the said claps. I think if you gave them a little more room on the eq spectrum it would keep your drop section a little more balanced as well. As for the musical aspect I would have enjoyed a little more variation throughout the song. Some ideas I would give would be adding harmonics on top of your already used synths using counter melodies and panning musical aspects of your choice percussion synths to give the stereo field some movement. I like the ideas! Keep going at it!,edmproduction,d10q1cs,1,t5_2sa4x

7010550,0,t3_4b90fe,I couldnt disagree more with this article it actually made me want to rant a little so here we go. access to technology like soundcloud and programs like ableton with relative ease plus more free knowledge and information on their usage available than any one person could ever learn means that more and more artists can make a name for themselves. The article points at a small circle of DJs but there are so many big producers now that I cant read an artist list for a big event like EDC without wondering who at least  of the artists are and I say that as someone who spends hours a day going through new music. There is no shortage of talented people making new electronic or of people who are following themlistening to their stuff.  Seven Lions who Id argue appeals to a fairly small niche of electronic music lovers has over  million followers on soundcloud. Do me a favor look up a few major artists on youtube and tell me what the view counts are compare that to people who are really mainstream artists like drake rihanna taylor swift kanye etc and tell me edm is dying. Lean onhas . billion views. Thats almost double Drakes hotline bling arguably his biggest song in quite some time which sits around .  Just because big room and fouronthefloor beats are dying out doesnt mean edm as a whole is dying. Just since  when edm supposedly started winding down weve seen the rise of three major new genres  future bass deep house and trap  and hundreds of talented new artists to accompany those genres. EDM is still huge with college and late high school kids I know because I not trying to sound like a douchebag here but it serves my point go to a pretty recognizable party school and I cant get away from it. Its all that gets played at every party every night at the bars every concert that comes through here is EDM. But its not the traditional edm now  its the new stuff. Jack  Snake Major Lazer Flume Kygo What So Not Louis and upcoming guys like Boombox graves Illenium Bro Safari etc etc. This whole new set of genres is just picking up not dying off or going anywhere.  Tommoroworld got themselves in a pickle by fucking up but thats their fault not the music genres which they were supporting. Since thats the biggest name festival they could mentiom going downhill I dont really see the point there. Its not the musics fault that the event fucked up. I can tell you this  EDC still sells the fuck out every single time in a matter of a couple days if not hours after the tickets go on sale. So do Flume concerts so do kygo concerts so do skrillex concerts etc etc. My rant is over but my point is that this article is trying to paint a picture that doesnt reflect at all the reality Im seeing.

Just check it out on YouTube counterpoint guidelines TheyllTell you things like the th must resolve down try not to double the third avoid parallel intervals etc etc Really though I suggest you just start doing it. Start with the bass line go a few octaves up and add the melody line these  will generally have the most movement just go with whatever sounds good. Then just fill the middle voices youll find they can usually remain static and they reharmonise very nicely. Add another voice and then move them around to increase tension between parts.

So if you wanr your guitar to be closer than your pad you either turn up the guitar and push the pad back. Or put the pad in a more distant space with reverb.

7337980,0,t1_d2c66fr,Thats true from a laying down chords perspective but when it comes to writing music Id argue its immensely useful to be able to just play rather than choose you chords.  And not from a time or efficiency standpoint but from a musicality standpoint.  I could effortlessly play a  bar chord progression with a little flavour to it Im no master or I could sit there and try to deliberately write down all the notes I think will work together. I guess what Im getting at is because I have the theory knowledge and piano experience I could never be more efficient sitting there trying to plan it out on screen.  It will always be superior to just play it into creation.  And even for the people who grew to be extremely proficient at writing in the DAW no matter how easily they can craft a progression theyre not really introducing it into creation the same way.  I do work that way sometimes and I find that maybe Im thinking using a different part of my brain.  Not any less valid or useful but perhaps less natural.  sorry for all this rambling nonsense Of course my preference has its limitations as well.  Im much slower at laying things down in midi and even editing things because I use that all the less often.  There are limits to what I can physically play though usually I tweak it all anyways after grabbing the midi. It keeps me limited to my desktop with my piano rather than being able to try working on a laptop which would mean more production time.Maybe Im kind of an outlier in these parts being more wellversed in the piano and theory side of things and new to the actual production and technical aspects.  Perhaps this advice isnt for everyone but I definitely think that if people strove to learn the theory concepts and  actually incorporate learning an instrument it helps immensely in being able to visualize navigate and create music.,edmproduction,d2ca0mn,1,t5_2sa4x

OR you can just listen to a bunch of tracks or a mix actually that could be a cool way to do it and just listen to how they all transition once you find the patterns and the little details they use to make the transition worthwhile. Beyond that find FX sample packs and just start creating random transitions until you understand what the names and jobs of every sound in the transition.

7407428,0,t1_d2jvgvd,From a beginning to intermediate standpoint definitely scrap something you dont like. You wont benefit much from beating a dead horse. Keep at it by starting again. Get really good at starting because thats often the hardest part.Though for a more advanced producer or composer I would definitely say keep at a piece you dont like. Youll have the experience to turn it into something you do like or at least something listenable. Thats when you start to get really good at ending.The way I see it is very similar to playing a brass instrument. There was a study done to test the difference between absolute novices and seasoned pros on the sound they make with their instruments. Both groups sound almost identical during the sustain of the note for example the middle of a song in producing but the difference was most pronounced in the beginning and end of the notes. THAT is the difference between a noob and pro. We teach kids playing brass instruments to have an excellent start to the note first and as they get better and better we pay more attention to the end of it as well.Try applying that approach to producingcomposing. Once you start a piece you will roll right along so get really good at starting. Then once you can start and sustain a piece of music get really good at ending it. Sorry that was really long.

If its occurring before the audio is even exported then theres some delay compensationbuffering issues in the DAW that youll need to fix...Lastly  if your version of Massive is pirated that could be the overall problem.

7506711,0,t3_4i3pp2, I can think of a few reasons here. First you dont want unexpected variables when mastering. If youre not bounced to audio a synth may be doing things a little different each time or your CPU may hiccup a bit and throw something off even if just in the slightest. Secondly bouncing down to audio relieves stress from your CPU to ensure adequate resource for mastering even on a second gen i processor I can only get so deep with Ozone before I have problems unless Im only running audio to it and not generators. As far as the club systems apparently many are monoonly. Like not even just under a certain frequency. This is done so that no matter where youre standing in the club youre getting the same music. You wouldnt want to be standing next to a left speaker and totally have it overpower anything you should have been hearing from the right speaker right? Youre only plugging your guitar into one input. That single input is being selected as the recording track. This will result in a mono signal. On any interfaces Ive owned it will have for instance stereo  and stereo  but if I were to record the input from only stereo  where the guitar was plugged in its only mono information. When you record tracktotrack in Ableton it always records a track with L and R outputs regardless of those tracks being exactly the same or not. A mono track can be represented by a single track or two tracks with  identical waveforms. At that point in the spectrum youre starting to get closer to the end of human hearing range. I imagine that its not a flat drop but a rolloff in percieved volume of those frequencies so raising those frequencies a bit may just be reintroducing them to the listener and adding a bit of sparkle.,edmproduction,d2vh3i7,2,t5_2sa4x

7557539,0,t1_d316z9o,In your DAW you have a lot of volume knobs. Theyre there in all sorts of places  synths effects the mixing console master chain etc.So each sound you make passes through like half a billion volume knobs before it actually reaches your speakers.Gain staging is the art of setting each of those volume knobs just right  not too loud and not too quiet.So by this point you might be wondering why would there be a difference if I turn a sound  dB down in the synth vs after an effect vs in the mixing console vs anywhere else?The answer is mostly... that it doesnt matter in the digital realm. Changing the volume of a sound before or after an effect in most cases will give the exact same result because most but not all operations are linear. Thats a fancy way of saying that the effect is independent of the input volume. Turning a sound down  dB before a delay is the same thing as turning it down after the delay.But some effects are not linear which means they behave differently depending on input volume. An obvious example is a compressor which makes a sound quieter if its above a threshold  turn the volume down before the sound goes into the compressor and if you make it quiet enough the sound will now be below the threshold and therefore the compressor wont do anything. Saturators are another example since the louder a sound is when it goes in the more distorted it will be.Most effects are however linear. In these cases gain staging literally doesnt matter at all. If you want to make a sound  dB quieter and there is no nonlinear processing applied to it where in the signal chain you change the gain is irrelevant. The end result is the same.So why do some people seem to think that gain staging is so important?Well on analog gear it is. Digital is just math which by its very nature its more or less perfect unless you deliberately introduce imperfections. Analog isnt like that. Most analog equipment is actually nonlinear even though slightly  it often introduces noise or subtle saturation for example. In these cases you generally want to turn everything as loud as it will go without nasty distortion so that the noise will be as quiet ad possible compared to the actual sound.But in digital? Theres no need to bother with any of this unless your plugins are imitating analog gear they might then introduce artifacts like the actual gear would. Theres no noise floor you need to think about and no nasty distortion most of the time.So yeah. Gain staging is useful sometimes yes and it was an important skill in the analog days. Still is if youre using hardware. But if you work entirely in the box its basically irrelevant save for a few cases and then its usually obvious.edit man this post got long... hope its helpful at least,edmproduction,d3197su,1,t5_2sa4x

7689759,0,t3_4klj8y,I dont really recommend this but I could play the piano from a young age and Ive always been musical but learning EDM production was hard obviously. I just went on youtube and looked at FL Studio remakes of popular songs I liked obviously the ones that sound good and looked how they were made and then put it into practice. Well they were a remake so different methods were used but you get my gist. I now use Ableton though but there is an FL remake for like EVERY song out there. I dont think you should have a specific plan like an exam criteria at school just take it as it comes. If youre making a song and want to know how to add sidechain etc  watch a tutorial. That way youre selfsufficient. Thats all I did for example I liked Martin Garrix  Animals when it came out because the big room hype was massive back then so I watched some tutorials on how to do it myself and then took it from there. This is probably useless to you but thats how I did it. Switching to Ableton was the best decision though I love how it works but feel free to try out different DAWs and see if you learn something. ,edmproduction,d3g9yj5,2,t5_2sa4x

Or... it could be bad in that this particular Supreme Court seems to almost always get copyright cases wrong meaning it could affirm the th Circuit interpretation and dump the ths once again doing serious harm to sampling as an art form. ,edmproduction,d3uv429,3,t5_2sa4x

Next is position within the stereo field where are we putting them? cutting out what we dont want and adjusting panning on certain things to make it wider or different.

8114172,0,t1_d4plxke,Intro    Generally like the intro. I think the lead is a little harsh so some additional voicesdetune or eqing down the highs or adding some reverb might work.The supporting instruments are really nice i.e. swelling chords and arp but theyre hard to hear because the lead is so aggressive and attention grabbing.Breakdown    I like the transition to a softer almost deadmaish sound but Id love to hear some supporting pads for the chords you already have. Sounds like you have some saw waves but not much else. A little bass as a part of the pads can also add to the emotional impact.Build Up    The percussion is a great add to the build up but I think you could add some more tension here if youre going for a dance track. Pitchbending something tends to work well as does Zedd style laser build ups high passing etc. I hear the white noise and that definitely helps but I think a little extra would really build up nicely to the drop.Chorus    The percussion adds the energy and the lead provides the focus but the drop could feel more powerful. Id consider adding a stronger bass. It sounds like the bass and lead you chose dont have much mids in them. You could either use a bass with signifiicantly more mids add supersaws to complement the lead andor thicken the lead to have more midslow mids. ,edmproduction,d4s3uax,1,t5_2sa4x

8160863,0,t3_4r1nrv,Ive found an understanding of music theory goes a long way towards improving songwriting. As a starting place try researching harmonic progression which is essentially an analytical approach to what order a series of chords should go in. The ideas behind the theory of harmonic progression were originally meant to apply to classical music and are regularly broken in modern music but its still a good place to understand why some chord progressions are more satisfying than others. Usually this has to do with shared notes or with notes that have lots of natural motion. For example in the key of C playing a B the seventh of the key of C will almost always create a tension that wants to resolve into C. You can manipulate this natural motion to highlight cadences which tends to make for a better written song.Also where do you usually start when you make a track? For me if I lay down drums and bass first then fill in the melody later the track tends to feel flat forced and just poorly written. I need to lead with the melody. However Ive met a number of very talented producers who prefer working opposite to the way I do leaving the melody for last. Everyone has their own workflow when it comes to writing but whats important is that you actually take the time to think about the strengths and weaknesses of your process particularly as it relates to songwriting. Then adjust your workflow to play to those strengths and compensate for the weaknesses. Another thing you can do is listen or even write music in a different genre. Since youre interested in improving songwriting I might suggest folk music. This type of music is often just a guy singing and strumming open chords on an acoustic guitar theres not a lot going on sonically. Because of that successful folk artists rely heavily on lyrics and songwriting to make their music unique and interesting. Obviously a folk singer is going to have a different approach to songwriting than an edm producer but there are a lot of areas of overlap. Think about Milky Chance for example.,edmproduction,d4xnmea,3,t5_2sa4x
8162422,0,t3_4r1nrv,Music theory is good but it can be doubled edged sword. Music theory courses are based around scales and chords.  It doesnt really cover melodies the most important part of good songwriting.I know some people that know every scale but cant write a melody to save their life and others that dont know shit for theory but can knock out amazing melodies like nothing.Dont get me wrong learn theory it wont hurt you.  But also study great melodies from artist you like like some have said use HookTheory and READ book it is great as well for melodies.  The  biggest ways I improved my songwriting... Studying artist I liked melodies and trying to find patterns in their style. Studied a lot of Hook Theory videos.  And reading the book and watching their video tutorials. Googling How to write good melodies digging around and readingwatching random articles. Singing even it is just humming a long when doing all of this will add up fast.  This is a must.  Learning basic music theory. Learn the majorminor scales and chords.  You can learn this almost anywhere. Memorizing melodies I like and writing my over variations of them. Learning to hear a song and find the root rd and th in the scale and freestyle singing over it.Stick with it it is the most powerful skill in making dance music.  Anyone can open a DAW and do sound design but it is months and years to hone your skill of writing good melodies.   This is why people like porter skrillex odesza audien ect rise above the rest... But amateur producers obsess over their sound design and mix downs... completely over looking melodies and music theory.Best of luck been are your shoes myself and it is worth the journey.,edmproduction,d4xumvc,2,t5_2sa4x

8210734,0,t3_4roxeo,I think there is a lot of good basics in here but I some issues with the more subjective statements made really a compressor just does what it does but it takes the producers vision and understanding of what emotion from a technical or musical standpoint or effect the compressor has on sound to use the tool effectively..also i disagree with most of the general tips... a lot of what is stated there will produce a certain effect but not every effect achieved by those settings is appropriate for all scenarios..e.g.  ms attack time? heck with that... how about putting the threshold right below the peak and setting a fast attack time so that the compressor grabs the transient and ONLY the transient.. more common with hardware compressors  thats how often the compressor signature sound is achieved without altering the source too muchOR . i could also set it at a higher  ms on a kick with a fast release to make it sound very pillowy and round out the transient and put the emphasis on the kicks release which goes against the previous advice to emphasize the transient...my point is this... when you get good at using a compressor heck mixing... you dont ask yourself what compressor or equalizer i should use.. you ask yourself what effect do I want and then what tool do I have that can achieve that sound..because of that IMHO a good compression tutorial should emphasize the effects that each setting CAN produce in addition to the other great objective tips you have in there and leave the desired sound up to the imagination of the creator..,edmproduction,d53wamq,3,t5_2sa4x

8305414,0,t1_d5fph8e,All of the responses given have been great so far.Another way of thinking about it especially when it comes to synths of the same type is how a guitarist may have multiple guitars. Some may be the same styletype of guitar but they each may have their own unique characteristics no matter how large the differences actually are. Different synths SOUND different. Even if its only a slight difference the differences are there. Some will be warmer some will be brighter some will have louder transients etc.Ultimately to the listener what a song is made with really doesnt matter. Nobody really cares in the end how something is made all that matters is the result. Keep that in mind if you find that youre spending a lot of time worrying about these differences. If it sounds good to you use it imo.EDIT I should mention that I still like to use a few synths myself. Serum Diva HIVE and Nexus are my favourites.

8347586,0,t1_d5kxqa6,Most pass filters create a little resonant boost at the cutoff point so if youre filtering all of your stems at the same frequency its worth taking into account because you could end up having to deal with an accumulative buildup of that frequency. Ive even see a signal that wasnt clipping beforehand go into the red after applying a high pass filter  its counter intuitive because you suppose that the signal should lose energy when filtering but that resonant boost at the cutoff can easily eat up headroom. ,edmproduction,d5l0238,3,t5_2sa4x

If you compare this to suara or drumcode or who ever the big name House and techno DJs are dropping its definitely on the more experimental side of things.

After you understand the fundamentals of all those types of synthesis then you find a VST for each one and tinker with it remaking sounds that you really like. This is where id suggest keeping a notepad where you timestamp your favourite synths from REALLY cool songs then try to understand how they were made and remake them yourself you will find that youll really suck at first but every time you learn a new knob and you tinker enough its like learning at an exponential rate. Learning one knob is like learning how to multiply and divide but each knob is a different operation each parameter helps you make millions of different variations of a sound to the point where you can almost make any sound given enough time and effort.,edmproduction,d6anq88,1,t5_2sa4x

8775743,0,t3_507zcd,I find Izotopes Vinyl plugin to be quite helpful. I really like the warp function basically pitch shifting its great for adding movement in synths. On one occasion I used Vinyl on the master chain in a song that was a sort of Shlomo style woozy beat with some chopped up guitar recordings.I also like to use saturation lightly a very subtle low pass filter cutting the width with a utility tool ableton and abletons vinyl distortion effect. Peak the resonance on the distortion and work it into a track. I would be careful with the tapecrackle control though I find it sounds pretty unrealistic. Another cool thing you can do is record some white noise with a mic and loop it over your song. The trick with realistic lofi is to use all these lightly over do it and itll end up sounding simulated. Cut down on the drum sidechaining too. Keep in mind that youre trying to emulate old recording styles that didnt utilize modern digital effects. Have fun! ,edmproduction,d72mvvv,1,t5_2sa4x

8821463,0,t1_d787kck,As opposed to what I already described using the warp function will let you change the pitch without stretching the sample. So perhaps you could stretch the sample to fit then turn on the warp mode test out different modes such as complexpro then transpose it back the opposite direction the same amount you had to do to make the sample fit in order to recorrect the pitch.Now there may be a better way to do this than what I have come up with but any time you alter the time of a sample it is going to result in distortion. There isnt any way around that. If you have to avoid the distortion at all cost build the beat around the sample instead.EDIT One more tip the detune control below transpose will let you change the sound in smaller increments than the transpose wheel.,edmproduction,d787vw6,2,t5_2sa4x

Very scratchy.The drums are a bit drowned within the melodies.Im not saying the song is terrible right now just the production quality. Give yourself more time to find the basics of leveling. Drums should always be the most audible.Try using an audio Spectrum. SPAN by Voxengo is free. Use it in your DAW and listen and watch the levels your music and others to compare.

I mention this to say if you are going to learn on your own pay attention to detail. Everything on a sheet of music is there for a reason and it is so easy to miss things in the beginning when you are so focused on just reading the music hitting the right notes and trying to stay in time. I dont know much about online lessons. There must be some good ones. Someone in the electronic music community recommended www.pianogenius.com to me in the beginning.

9314365,0,t1_d8wnq1b,Give me a bit and Ill write up a little comment on things I think you should learn. Disclaimer I have no idea what your level is.Ok especially for edm which is like pop kinda you gotta know the I IV V and vi chords or    and minor  chord. Those names are based on the scale degree the chord is on. So in C Major C is scale degree  D is  E is  so on and so forth.Our chords here would be C major F major G major and A minor. These are super important chords for lots of popular edm.A major chord is structured like this root note up  half steps then up  half steps. So a C Major chords would be C up four half steps to E and up three more half steps to G. This pattern is the same for ALL major chords. Take any note build a chord in that fashion and itll be a major chord.A minor chord is kinda a mirror image. Root up  half steps then up  half steps.Sooo C Major  C E GF major  F A CG major  G B DA minor  A C EThose are the notes in each of those chords. An incredibly important thing is to use inversions of the chords to smooth transitions.A I chord is C E GA I chord is E G CA I is G C E.Basically those are the three kind of inversions youll use a lot. x x and x. Each inversion just takes the bottom note of the chord and puts it on the top.Take the progression vi IV I V or Am F C G. We could play vi  IV  I  V.Compared to playing vi IV I V it seems a lot smoother..almost like its creating its own melodic tension that you can draw melodies from. Inversions are important because they each emphasize a different aspect of a chord.Heres an exercise. Make some  bar loops. Have each bar be a different chord. Like try vi IV I V and IV V vi I. Then just play with creating melodies over them. I always feel like having a chord progression already to work with helps the song just kinda writes itself.Its super late so if any of this doesnt make sense or you have questions comment and Ill respond tomorrow!,edmproduction,d8wnxpt,1,t5_2sa4x

I thought your track worked really well agree with the vocals not really standing out in the intro maybe they want more space in the mix frequency wise.

9378240,0,t1_d88yv37,Hmmm I would say invest in a better piano vst firstly. I think it sounds... dry in the beginning. Give it space. Effects exist for a reason and there are millions of them my friend. Give the beginning some reverb chorus or maybe even a flanger if you like that kind of thing? Transitions are musically clean which makes me so happy as a musician in music school myself. There are too many songs without correct harmonic transitions TT However they could use a better production wise transition. Cymbals are great for this actually. Especially nicely spread rides! I like the way your kick is mixed and snare is nice too but the snare could maybe benefit from a limiter. And its volume could be reduced.

Thanks for reminding me of that. edit I really hate predictability. I have often said its the biggest strength and downfall in EDM. When used moderately it really brings in a ton of energy.

What Music Theory does for you is allow you to translate your seed into a more complete musical idea.  Theory is what allows you to put chords to that melody you cant stop humming or use voice leading harmony and resolution to put a great melody over those sweet guitar chords.  While you cant force emotion you can turn that raw emotion into a better song with a better understanding of theory.  Look at the best composers from any era... The guitarists from Metallica and Rush were classically trained hell Queens guitarist was an astrophysicist tell me he doesnt understand the mathematical underpinnings of music theory.

9504863,0,t1_d9ko38o,No you also want to make sure that your music sounds good on headphones because that is how a lot of your listeners will listen to your songs. Also headphones will be clearer. You will hear more details than with studio monitors. If something is out of place it will be obvious. My gripe with headphones is that the bass is much clearer than on monitors. This means that if I mix only with headphones I will think that there is enough bass but I will hardly hear it on monitors. So mix with monitors check details with headphones. ,edmproduction,d9kodl5,3,t5_2sa4x

9657766,0,t3_5dcnag,gt I want to choose a software with a good price that can make good or decent dubstepThing is its not the software that makes the dubstep its what you do with it that counts. Skrillex could make great music with the shittiest DAW digital audio workstation  production app while a beginner couldnt make anything decent with the best software out thereReally all major DAWs do the same thing. Which one you choose doesnt matter tbh you can make good dubstep or anything else in any of them. So just take a look at all of them and decide which one you think looks best yes im serious and is worth the priceNow of course there are differences in workflow but until youve actually produced for a year or more realistically two you cant really tell which you like most. Just pick one and stick with it so youll learn how to use itQuick list of DAWs by no means exclusive but its a starting point Ableton Live FL Studio Logic Reason Cubase Pro Tools. If youve got one of these you cant really go wrong. But do try the demos firstgt Each software you list needs the best dubstep artist that uses that softwareas said above the software is mostly irrelevant as long as you know how to use it. so im not gonna do thisgt is making remixes copyrighted?you probably have to deal with copyright stuff but it depends on how the song was released label no label etcgt Do you need to ask permission to the producer of the original song to make a remix of it?you dont need to but its certainly a good idea. again it depends heavily on how it was released and theres no single answergt How do you make a song with another producer?collaborationyou ask and then they listen to your music and decide if they want to collab with you. or they ask you or youre buddies or whatever. thing is you should be at comparable skill levelsgt anything else I should knowmy best advice is that production is tons of fun so just keep that in mind because right now you suck at producing and you will continue to suck at producing for a long time. dont expect to make anything decent for at the very least  year and thats if you produce many hours per day. so if you download your DAW and expect to make good music youll be sorely disappointed. if you remember that youre doing this because its fun not because youre getting good results then the results will come in time.,edmproduction,da3is43,3,t5_2sa4x

9826055,0,t1_dao7yh3,Well I just started in JuneJuly so as you can imagine havent seen the first royalty statements yet! But the guy Im working for has songs on E! network ESPN etc so thats the kind of angle itd be aiming for. Obviously any network can pick it up but I wont know until royalty splits come out next quarter. I will tell you even just using something like  for your productions will help. Youll see sales right away and I think youll keep a larger cut that way. However youll be aiming for smaller markets for the most part and more Indie buyers.I should point out Im not doing this as my main music staple its just to get some extra cash on the side but so far the experiences and set ups and networking have been worth it.

9885749,0,t3_5gynj6,My current set up includes a pair of computer speakers and a very small subwoofer as well as VMODA Crossfade LP headphones. Thus I dont have anything near a flat response. However I overcome this issue by using reference tracks. These can greatly help as they can be a guide as to how you arrange and mix. Additionally be sure to reserve a spot for each sound. Essentially allocating certain frequencies for certain sounds giving you a balanced mix. For instance Ill often reserve most of the high frequencies for cymbals claps as well a few leads. In addition to this Ill place the kick drums and bass within the lower frequencies. Keep in mind youll always have certain elements that you want the listener to focus on which of course varies by producer. Lastly keep in mind everything should be in unisonwanting the attention on the drums is great but dont let it stray the listener from everything else.I hope this helped!,edmproduction,daw4xaj,1,t5_2sa4x
9892880,0,t1_dawwcz0,So I wasnt literally putting an entire mastering chain on each track but I knew mastering chains typically consist of compression EQ and limiting. So Id do whatever I normally do during sound design but at the end of that Id make sure the compression EQing limiting and volume of each track was exactly where I wanted it to be individually. Id still have a master chain on my master channel but it would typically do almost nothing basically would be just a brick wall limiter with some really minor EQ shelfing before it.Id do this but instead of having each track peak at some level below  Id have my typically speaking kick and snare hitting  sub bass hitting pretty high but not quite zero and then bring levels up around those until it sounds and looks natural.You could honestly argue I was just making loud mixdowns and practically skipping the mastering phase. But my goal was addressing mastering track by track. ,edmproduction,dax2dc3,2,t5_2sa4x

A lot of people will try to recreate sounds that their favourite artists use for practice as wellA good way I find to learn how things really work is pretend that youre explaining it to someone who has no idea what youre talking about. Once you can explain this concept For example how an EQ or a Compressor workswhat it does to someone who has zero previous knowledge then you really understand how it works.Also you seem to be on a good track with the next tip Spend time watching tutorials.

10258273,0,t1_dc6rmmi,It isnt just the DAW its the plugins. Synthesizers are much more CPU intensive than they are RAM intensive opposite for sample players et cetera. It really depends. I build computers Im not an Intel engineer designing the next architecture for their microprocessors but I know enough to know that to suggest that GB is the minimum for audio production is absolutely preposterous. Most people could probably get by on GB. Like I said Ive been running  my entire idk career as a producer and Ive never ran into any memory problems whatsoever and I certainly use sample players like Kontakt and several instances within one project at that alongside CPU intensive programs like MassiveFMSytrus.,edmproduction,dc6ty8m,1,t5_2sa4x

10261888,0,t3_5mx2an,Hey I just replaced my krk s with hss too. Got them  on amazon with stands foam insulation cables and a pair of athms. Sorry if I sound like a commercial but it seemed like a crazy good deal.Anyway!The idea behind the yammies is that they are pretty flat for the pricetag. If you were mixing on KRKs then you probably had to take your mixes out to your car and other peoples stereos to compensate for the hyped  muddled low end and other minor colorations. As with any new monitors you should play professionally mixed and mastered music that is similar to what you will be producing on them at a moderate volume for  hours or so to break them in. After that your going to have to learn them by trial and error. Taking the mixes youve made on them and bouncing them around on different systems to see where youll have problems. Or if you are a sound god you can take a reference track that you know in and out and compare it to the sound on the hss. Of course you also have to keep them away from your walls because they are rear ported. It depends on the acoustic properties of your studio but at least a foot preferably . FEET from the nearest surface. Also Ive heard the HSs dont have any shielding so if there are things vibrating near it the monitor will pick it up. Definitely invest in some foam padding and monitor stands if you dont have them already.It should go without saying that if you are using  inch cones your studio should be treated. At least some bass traps and the point of first reflection.,edmproduction,dc78ok7,1,t5_2sa4x

10292243,0,t3_5n38b6,As a DJ Ive seen both.  Generally speaking the mono  setups tend to be smaller underground clubs or older clubs that havent upgraded.It is difficult to get Stereo correct when you have to cover a whole room that is facing different directions and moving all over the place.  It takes an experienced audio engineer and a decent budget to do Stereo in a club.It isnt like a move theater where everyone is facing the same direction.So its really all about how much money the club puts into the sound system.Ive seen very small venues that are very picky on sound have very good stereo systems for example The Complex in Glendale CA If someone is going to open up a brand new Tops dance venue today and is spending at least  on the sound system then its likely itll be Stereo.Also you might try this question at rlivesound ,edmproduction,dcaojmm,1,t5_2sa4x
10292937,0,t3_5nc3a2,Some more information for those curiousEach folder has anywhere from  soundsI did not delete the sounds that didnt make the cut and still access them from time to timeI also used this organizing as a tool to find out what resources I lacked. Afterwards I went onto splice.com and payed for samples to fill out the folders that felt too sparse to rely on for that element.The folders I find most useful are kicks textures white noise transitions drum loops and fills cause these all take a really long time ususally and If I can get away with using something in here it can save me mins or more to create something. And for drum loops I use in the early creative stages it helps to get things going quicklyDoing this allowed me to also form a more solid opinion of different sample packs based on how much I kept. I would say some overrated sample packs are Black Octopus Leviathan Cymatics stuff and Vengeance. Really good packs from Vandalism PushBang and mostly random stuff here and there.If Ive learned one thing its that youll have better luck grabbing good samples here and there from all over the place rather than mostly relying on  or  sample packs. Also dont just hoard sample packs with no organization because you wont have reasonable access to the stuff you need and wont be able to utilize it sort of like finding a needle in a haystack you probably wont even look or know in the first place. Lastly It gave me familiarity with all my sounds not just the ones I kept. Im not gonna wonder and search for a sample I have when I know all the samples I have. I listened to every single one of them. It took fucking months. Fuck.Hope this helps again guys keep making good music out there,edmproduction,dcardk0,4,t5_2sa4x

10326824,0,t1_dccrneo,Oh man this track is actually pretty good not only in technical terms but its really really unique the sound design is really interesting yet still fits together to make a powerful track.Specific questions  Your sound design is pretty good and interesting. However there are a few small problems. The piano at the beginning to be honest it sounds kinda fake like it was sampled even if it wasnt. This can be easily fixed with some reverbdelay and a bit of EQ since you already have reverb mostly try changing the eq around. The lead sound that can be heard in the background at around  sounds a bit awkward things you can try are adding warmth bass and low passing even more. In general dont worry too much about sound design and samples you already have it pretty good. In addition make sure you START with a good sample...dont spend hours processing one XD  Adding midrange I actually like the frequency structure of your track alot already I like the minimalisticness  beware of the problem that by filling out frequencies more you will have less headroom for other frequencies. To answer your question though you can add a quiet pad low pass panned to the sides etc. Or you can layer the lead synth with something playing an octave lowerOther stuff  I felt like the volume of some instruments sounded like it was being automated. This can add interest but too much kind of bothers me or maybe it was panning  Sub bass may be too loud  sounds fine on headphones maybe a bit powerful which means it will be a lot louder on better sound systemsRelease a track like this polish it a bit and theres a decent chance that people will notice you ,edmproduction,dcelpww,1,t5_2sa4x

See my response to him haha I know from experience you can treat your own depression and while its not that easy it is as simple as it sounds you just need to understand how The how part isnt as simple but it is still simple in theory. It is work in practice but isnt a life free of depression worth any amount of work you can put in if one day you just WANT to do a bunch of stuff be healthy and be happy? If anything provided you live in good ol capitalist U.S. like myself working yourself out of depressionold depressed habits will make you a much more successful person. In capitalist countries the more work you do the more money you earn Most of the time whether you see the work or not though there is also random chance. From experience its pretty hard to work to anywhere near your fullest potential while depressed so getting rid of that monkey once and for all is extremely conductive to your success as an individual. I have been addicted to drugs and food frankly and depression is very similar to psychological drug dependence in how you deal with it. Meth abuse recovery Never been personally addicted to meth I just know what it entails is a good example. However again from personal experience losing weightkeeping weight offeating well when you are or used to be As is my case obese is much more difficult to maintain than a depression OR drug free mindset lmao. Oddly enough fighting my urges to consume a fuckton of really unhealthy food in binges throughout the day Also personally fighting drug addiction while still giving myself occasional access to drugs is what showed me that I have the power to control myself no matter what I think Unless youre literally delirious or something. While most people probably havent drawn that conclusion yet it is true for nearly everyone By nearly I mean some really really really bad physically present mental conditions are obviously almost impossible to treat by yourself or even just with psychological help.,edmproduction,ddb0dht,1,t5_2sa4x

10629771,0,t3_5s2pxy,If youre a drummer then you will love Jamstix. Its the only VST that comes close to working with a real drummer IMO. As a drummer it speaks your language. Comes with a variety of drummer models amp styles and you can use its MIDI output to drive any drum module you like Battery Geist Addictive Drums whatever. Basically how it works is that you set up a song structure within its internal sequencer intro verse bridge chorus etc however you like and then you select a drummer model and style and then get to work tweaking its brain which consists of a myriad of different drummingrelated parameters which affect how the drummer plays in very intricate and realistic ways. It has separate brains for the groove accent and fills and every aspect can be set up exactly to your taste for each part of the song. You can even switch drummers and music styles from part to part. It definitely has a bit of a learning curve before you get it and will most likely take a couple of reads of the manual before it starts to make sense and you also have to be comfortable with things like routing MIDI from a plugin to a MIDI track unless you want to use the inbuilt drum samples it comes with. If you know what youre doing you can dial in the exact groove youre looking for and control every aspect of the playing power the accents the groove and the fills. You can even load your own basic MIDI groove into it and it will interpret that groove according to the player and brain settings and will provide endless variations. You can also dial in the exact pocket to fit the feel of the track as well as give it some swing. A lot of people dismiss it as a tool for making traditional sounding drums for more mainstream styles but I use it all the time for electronic music. If like me the mechanical accuracy of sequenced drums kind of upsets you its a fantastic way to add a human feel to your breaks. The good thing is that if you purchase Jamstix now you get a free upgrade to Jamstix  which is coming out soon and looks to be a definite improvement Jamstix  is a little quirky in its UI style to say the least!. Oh and I almost forgot to add if youre looking for outrageous rhythmic complexity bar of  followed by  and then  and  Jamstix does it without blinking. ,edmproduction,ddcdov3,3,t5_2sa4x

10662816,0,t3_5shgn0,First of all I really like the song! I like that you change the rythmic patterns a lot. Warms a drummers heart.As for the supersaw you mentioned I have a couple of pointers. Sidechaining has already been mentioned and I think that would improve the mix. Also it sounds like youve detuned the saws quite a bit so they drown a little. Or maybe its an effect you added? You want them to hit hard when the drop kicks in. A way of doing that is to have two saw tracks. One is completely dry and dead center without any detuning. The other one is detuned and reverberated. Here you can manipulate the stereo field to your liking to achieve that sense of vastness. Make sure to EQ and glue them properly so that they sound unified in the mix. Also look up midside EQingAs a last note be careful when adding reverb. Too much can make the mix bleed so automating the drywet can be very helpful. Hope this helps!

Then you have a so called unstable fader because you just cant decide the level to choose which makes the kick sit well in the mix. What to do?Well one trick is to use a transient shaper or compressor with transient shaping settings. You dont change the kicks volume but the more emphasized transient puts it more to the front.Or vice versa for putting it more to the back.My recommendation for fasttrack skillimprovement Next time someone tells you Use saturation!

10708594,0,t1_ddj7we6,I really enjoyed this track! The drums and arrangement is different from most dubstep tracks which I appreciate. The panning vocal build was cool and the initial drum climax was powerful. The first breakmelodic score is well done and brings a more conventional house concept complimenting the atmosphere of the track nicely. However the bass line felt as if there no presence but perhaps it could just be my headphones although Id be to sure to test it on multiple systems to ensure the mix  master translate well. Furthermore the kick sounds a bit muddy in the scoretoms are a good fit but Id expand and implement them throughout to keep a steady beat helping with transitions. Moreover I would suggest to dip the volume before the second climax to create the illusion of a more powerful impact. The secondary leadpreset is well executed and the wideness is a good touch too. Lastly I liked the grittyaggressive mix but I think subtle touches within could help clean it up a bit resulting in a louder mix  master. Keep up the good work!I hope this helped!,edmproduction,ddkiex7,1,t5_2sa4x

10909190,0,t1_de5506b,Yeah one enhances the other definitely. You end up with something that is greater than the sum of its parts. But I think the point I was trying to make is that when you arrange a piece of music well it requires less processing in order to make it sound good. And in general the less EQing and compressing that you have to do to make a track sound clear and punchy the better. I think what a lot of people lose sight of is that in the past before audio engineers had access to unlimited instances of EQ and compressor plugins and had to make do with a limited number of hardware units which generally had less flexibility than VSTs in terms of how many bands you could EQ many also containing fixed frequency bands they still managed to make mixes with incredible clarity and punch. Another great example is orchestras. There you have up to  musicians playing at once with upwards of  different instruments and yet the audio engineers who record and mix them arent dicking around with  EQs trying to carve out space for each instrument with complex EQ curves and sidechain compressor routing. Thats because orchestras have been designed to have a good blend of instruments which sound great together a balance of timbres and frequency registers and because a well arranged piece of orchestral music takes these timbres and registers into account in order to create a balanced sound. ,edmproduction,de57exn,4,t5_2sa4x

Regarding velocity and randomization is not so arbitrary most often than not a good pianist hits pretty much on time unless for strumming chords or any other articulation. Velocity isnt random either and ideally you dont variate it much unless it says so in the piece.Although yes Nexus pianos are not the best of the best option.

11033054,0,t1_deiafme,gti.e. a really well composed song with mediocre mixsound design is better then a poorly composed song with a great mixsound design. The problem is that you and a lot of people here think these two things are separate.The sound design is a part of the song its not just something you throw on top of a composition. Try playing a metal song purely on the piano its not going to be the same. So many people say your song should sound good with just sine waves or just a piano but no the sound design is a key part of the song especially in EDM and sometimes a composition should be simple to highlight the sound design.Its like how people I see on YouTube complain about psychrock style songs being too simple. But they dont get it music isnt about complexity its not about jerking yourself off in front of a crowd like wow look how good I am at fingering a fret board its about making good songs. And these songs are about the sound design and the atmosphere it creates. Having a super complex melody would just take away from the atmosphere those songs are creating.,edmproduction,deikl4i,8,t5_2sa4x

11038289,0,t1_dej36fd,Excellent answer!gt With lots of distortion more complicated chords start sounding muddy and unclear.From my understanding this is because distortion and many other similar effects introduce all sorts of extra harmonics which in simple terms is the equivalent of playing more notes at the same time. ,edmproduction,dej65lr,17,t5_2sa4x

11067897,0,t1_demgwx0,Welp I have a pentium  and it is indeed an issue. But the problem is not Serum. I can kill my CPU with sylenth aswell its all down to number of voices. If you want you can just keep the amount of voices down in Serum and while it will always use more CPU than sylenth its worth it imo. As someone else said you cant make the sounds made in Serum with Sylenth. If youre worried about CPU work with minimal unisono and draft quality and when youre ready to render increase it to max. Thats what I do. Well that  bouncing which is super quick and simple in both FL and Ableton.But yeah disclaimer even at draft quality and low unisono if I play huge chords with  notes I will reach  cpu with just that. Same situation in sylenth might take like  cpu. Massive does it best since you can go from  to  iirc voices regardless of synth qualityunisono settings and with the same amount of notes I can kill my cpu in massive aswell if I set voices to . ,edmproduction,demjaj2,1,t5_2sa4x

11361234,0,t3_61s9pt,I have all my samples on a couple of floppy disks. Since working with floppies is so awkward and slow I spent a LOT of time picking out the cleanest most suitable and reuseable sounds for a small sample library. I know each sample by name. By the time Ive eqd and added some effects I have a large variety of drumkits. Never been happier or more productive. Quality over quantity absolutely. ,edmproduction,dfjrwgx,1,t5_2sa4x
11362044,0,t1_dfhctqj,gt Loving the chord progression!!! Wow that walkdown at the end of the phrase is TASTY. And the synths themselves are fkn dope. They sound full and are interesting to my ears. Nice envelopes.The arpeggiated solos are a bit much for me but thats just personal taste  I dont often like things so hyper busy. However one thing I do notice thats perhaps a bit more objective is that the solo synth lines are mixed really high in the mix... I know theyre the focus of the song but their loudness is a bit too much.The hey vocal sample seems like it was just thrown in there  why? If I were you Id have it also featured elsewhere in the song so theres a feeling of continuity or not at all.Also your art is sick!!,edmproduction,dfjv77i,1,t5_2sa4x

11367383,0,t1_dfje8kh,Ive been learning about dsp digital signal processing math for making vst plugins because im a comp sci nerd and it turns out the simplest mathematical function for a lowpass filter sounds terrible to the human ear. Analog modeled or purely digital vst filters and fx have all sorts of crazy little bits of math sprinkled here and there in the code to make the effect respond similarly to analog gear in the case of a modeled vst or add a unique tonal character in the case of serum or any vst not based on analog gear.In terms of your question about eqs and filters the subtle differences in the math that changes the incoming signal makes a really big difference in signal output. This is most likely why you like the sound of the Serum filters over the ones found in Ableton.,edmproduction,dfkgyp1,1,t5_2sa4x

11375322,0,t1_dfl8dxd,Ableton does this too. Its not exporting anything to above dB. In fact thats entirely impossible to do in a WAV MP or really any other digital audio format out there.What its actually doing is exporting to a single fixed samplerate audio file usually .kHz and if two samples that are sitting next to each other in the file are both at dB bad audio interfaces will interpolate to above dB during digitalanalog conversion AKA playback. This is called intersample peaks and it was the bane of my existence for several years! Most mastering compressorslimiters have a button that says ISP or Oversampling.

If you go to a decent barber they likely check to make sure that they didnt miss any spots that your sideburns are even or fix any small errors etc when theyre done with your cut.  Mastering is just trying to correct  improve little details of your track for maximum sound quality or for technical reasons so your track sounds as good as possible despite how well it has been mixed.However your track should sound final without mastering.

11747586,0,t3_64xct9,For me  Rule of thumb is to mix the drums loudest. The kick will represent db the snare may be one or  db lower in RMS that is.  My sub bass has to be the same level as the kick or a little louder and to keep a nice dynamic I switch between mono and stereo basses. any thing that is like white noise goes about  db quieter that the kick or lowerHi pass everything but the kick and sub bass at least at  hz but a lot of time hz is what I do. Some time snares are good with sub.Use about  track that sound mixed good next to your in the daw so you have an idea how loud everything should be.Most of the time you should just close your eyes and level everything before eq and compression and you will be fine,edmproduction,dgrm9pm,1,t5_2sa4x

11771784,0,t3_67mpge,If youre most concerned about using a piano roll FL has the best Piano Roll out of any DAW without contest. Its not classic notation but it definitely is the best for using piano roll. If you feel limited by FLs piano roll than anything else is going to be a kick in the junk for you.Fl is cheap lifetime updates for free and you probably dont need every synth and vst. The most unlocked feature version without all the extra VSTs is the best bang for buck because you can select what synths and vsts you want. Ive been using FL a few years so Im bias but FL is very modular and very free form. If youre coming from a jazz background you may really like that. Its visual interface is highly customizable and its renowned for its speed of workflow. If you read what the pros say about it the most common kind of review they leave is Its fast So getting down ideas quickly and smoothly is something you can look forward to when you have a mastery of the hotkeysmovement through the DAW.Highly recommend FL as it won musicradars best DAW of  Much to the Chagrin of the ever populated Ableton fanbase and the price is so reasonable.

Their demo and promo emails are two separate things.This is a huge list so Id love to be proven wrong but thats just my two cents.

Ive got a bunch of skins from online but I know what you mean theres only a few that actually look good! Ill legit spend time coloring all my tracks and putting the black deviant art theme on it just to make it look pretty. Its like my studio looks cool its decked out with lights and vibes and such but the Ableon is just this ugly ass thing unless you take the time to make it look good.

11785277,0,t1_dgv2ijr,A long time ago when I experimented with Reason and found I really liked it but couldnt use my VSTs I abandoned it because I realized their product strategy was either insane or not for me or both. I tweeted to Propellerhead about how VST support was the only thing keeping me from using it and they replied that they prioritize keeping the DAW portable and always backwards compatible so that you can always load up old projects without worry may not be true once VSTs are involved. That pissed me off and also seemed to be really stupid reasoning because its up to me whether or not I care about being able to open old projects without worrying about the VSTs being installed. That should be my choice not theirs it makes no sense to deny me the option to use VSTs with the drawbacks if I choose so I shrugged and moved on to Ableton who seemed far more sane and reasonable as a company.I have to wonder what changed inside Reason headquarters to get them to do this. Did the crazy guy who always said were not doing VSTs finally quit? Did financial struggle drive it? Did they just after decades get tired of the overbearingly loud complaining about this single indefensible defect of their DAW? You gotta wonder.So anyway yeah I do still carry some angergrudge about this issue. Im glad they finally did it but it doesnt erase the bizarro reality they were in for so many years.,edmproduction,dgvwew5,3,t5_2sa4x
