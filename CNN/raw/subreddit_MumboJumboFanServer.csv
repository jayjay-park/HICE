4673158,0,t3_3ewpck,As I said earlier in another post Im also in Biffas server and there I have a community wool farm at my base. Ive built there some builds that have required quite a lot of wool. For example a war ship that took about  blocks of wool. In the game statistics my most used item is wool at  blocks used. So Im going to make a wool farm at the server. At Biffas I also have a slime farm but if someone else wants to build one Im ok with that.I have plans for my base in the server and it requires quite a lot of wool not surprise there.At Biffas server we had quite a lot of troubles concerning griefers and now we are in the second season there the server runs in spigot Biffa have some protection going on to catch griefers and thiefs. We have had  banning there this season. But I hope we wont have troubles here. Also last summer we almost lost a map when a town was built too close to spawn chunks but with MCEdit we got around that.I hate mention Biffa too much but in spawn town which is not in spawn point we have a plot size and some buffer to the next house for the roads. But not a grid system or something like that. There are some thought about goals for the server...,MumboJumboFanServer,ctjlpao,1,t5_3991v

4697462,0,t1_ctmne64,Well i think it might be a bit early to asign roles or to say i am building it and i need you to do this and to do that I think no one should deside yet who is building what. This Reddit is just to share ideas and have a conversation. And for the  floors why not? This farm is theoretically stackable unto build limit. ,MumboJumboFanServer,ctmnko0,2,t5_3991v

4782873,0,t1_ctwz4fp,I am working on an iron farm array.  I have secured six villagers and should have the basic iron farm operational some time tomorrow.  From there I would like to breed the villagers at their location and ship them into an array of farms at some location that we all agree is workable.If anyone has a good site for this kind of setup ocean space near spawn would be ideal please reply to this thread.,MumboJumboFanServer,ctxf6gv,1,t5_3991v
4783582,0,t1_ctxhjwx,Personally I would think that instead of leveling the ground you could just make a hole big enough for the farm. For example the farm Im talking about which may be docms but its not his video Im referencing I will look his up to see similarities is x with a villager holding area off to the side. So a xish hole wouldnt be TOO painful to dig especially with help down to bedrockish level.Edit So I took a quick lookskim through docms and it is very similar. The one Im looking at which is from Nims functions a little more like the titan with auto kill. It really just seems to be a slightly more compact and only has the one side. So unlike docms youd have to figure out some kind of linkage. But I dont know if the x that docm builds is better since I think he said it was  villagers and nims is . I may play around later with trying to space  of them on top of each other and seeing if they still work. Since both start  off the ground though I think that itd be ok though. ,MumboJumboFanServer,ctxie48,1,t5_3991v

6846319,0,t3_49ix6l,Im going to start off by saying please send us these sorts of suggestions about the new . server via email so that we can discuss it during the official meeting.That being said Ill nip this one in the behind before it gets out of hand.What youre proposing SHOULD be fine in a perfect world.  But in order for privacy to be a thing and to deal with situations quietly and respectfully we cant give every user the ability to know exactly who stole their stuff or who broke what etc...In a perfect world that would save mods hours of time and cause you guys a lot less frustration because you would bring up the issues directly to the mods when you find them.But there are many users who are less respectful than you may be.  They will see that so and so stole their stuff and they will seek retribution on their own terms. In some cases a theft or a grief was accidental or not meant maliciously.  But when those things are done to you its hard to see that possibility and you might go overboard in response.The mods have been chosen because they have proven in many instances that they can be trusted and have the maturity to handle things in a respectful way.  Though Im sure there are many players on the server that are just as respectful trust me there are an equal amount of players that wouldnt be so respectful.I hate to say this but Im dropping a solid veto on this one and I have the backing of a few other mods as well in case youre thinking Im working on my own accord ,MumboJumboFanServer,d0sc4tv,3,t5_3991v

When I made the stairs down to it in the Nether it was just a few hours before the End Portal was opened and I just didnt have the time to do anything on the overworld side.  I just blocked off all side exits so that there was one path to the end portal.I also made the area around the End Portal on the old server.  I had a lot more time to work on it there and put lots of chests for people to put their stuff before the End Dragon fight and a room with everything anyone could need beds crafting benches furnaces enderchest and enchanting table.I think the whole area should be opened out so that it feels spacious maybe incorporating end stonebrickpurpur in the design but thats personal preference  currently anything will be better than the vanilla stonebrick area.,MumboJumboFanServer,d3hbgzk,2,t5_3991v
