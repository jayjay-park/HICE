1006777,0,t3_25m1fi,UGH Bill Nye. Fucking phony. He relishes his scientist! title but hes nothing more than a mouthpiece a useful IDIOT for the Green machine. He doesnt hold a candle to the likes of Newton et alSir Isaac Newtona remarkable intellect who developed calculus discovered the law of gravity and designed the first reflecting telescopevigilantly defended the biblical account of creation. Louis Pasteur best known for developing the concept of pasteurization and demolishing the concept of spontaneous generation underscored the power of revelation and undermined the evident absurdities of Darwinian evolution.Finally a veritable host of stars in the constellation of scientific discovery were people of science and people of God Johannes Kepler astronomy Francis Bacon scientific method Blaise Pascal mathematics and philosophy Carolus Linnaeus biological taxonomy Gregor Mendel genetics Michael Faraday electromagnetics Joseph Lister antiseptic surgery Henrietta Swan Leavitt astronomy and Clara Swain medicine. Source Henry M. Morris Men of Science Men of God Great Scientists of the Past Who Believed the Bible Master Books reposted from Creation Answer Book by the Christian Research Institute. Not BS no new earth nonsense only real proven science. Bill Nye is a big fat phony with an agenda and also I heard he is a total ass hole and his neighbors despise him. He picks fights with idiots who cant defend themselves Ham a retard and calls himself the winner well sure you win when youre a man with one eye and wins a fight with a blind man. ,UNAgenda21,chiq8bs,3,t5_2v7oy
1937852,0,t1_ckl8u58,I get what you are saying but if you have never had to watch someone suffer and die from an incurable disease over a period of months or years you cant understand why people push for involuntary suicide.  I do not believe that allowing voluntary doctor assisted suicide by necessity leads to mandatory death panels.  You cant deny something of benefit because you fear something negative could happen from it.  This is the precise wrong way of thinking that has led to banning pot.  could lead to use of harder drugs  Okay.  But there are more and more studies showing there are tremendous medical benefits to be had from it.  We as a people are capable of allowing something beneficial without going over board if people will stay awake and actually participate in the world they live in. ,UNAgenda21,ckmpbrg,1,t5_2v7oy
