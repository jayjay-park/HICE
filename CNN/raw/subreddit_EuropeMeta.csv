5252825,1,t1_cvj5imo,gt Maybe the arrogance of this sentence alone? Who do you think you are?What? Its an honest answer. I thought people would appreciate more transparency from the reurope mod team. I gave short concise answers so no wrong interpretation could be made. If it sounds arrogant it wasnt meant that way.Maybe I should have said we instead of I though I agree. gt There I said it. Am I banned now?I seriously think youve overestimating how much this whole thing is me personally instead of me just implementing the general policy. ,EuropeMeta,cvj5jpj,3,t5_396na
5255658,1,t1_cvjhijn,Are you joking? The result are immigration to Germany and asylum in Germany. And they coming to the EU. This is a sign for the German refugee politic miscommunication.

5325587,0,t1_cvse3m5,But even if it was a news organisation it still got banned because it wrote an article about censorship on the sub. There may have been hoaxes and other issues in the past but it seems that they were specifically going to be banned forever because of their article about censorship on the sub.,EuropeMeta,cvselyg,0,t5_396na
5359622,0,t1_cvuzfpy,gt Cant remember anybody saying that either.Theres an example of it in this thread for goodness sake...Could be because thats the only way hatredspewing bigots can score pointsIts clear that some people consider any opinion other than theirs to be evil and think that it should be censored. So the claim that some people are effectively saying Please censor any opinions that I dont agree with is completely valid and claiming this sentiment doesnt exist when it clearly does only serves to endorse it.,EuropeMeta,cvwr375,4,t5_396na

5656390,0,t1_cwy5p2v,gtThe scale of the exodus in villages like Sabaa demonstrates the challenges facing European leadersgtThe exodus though is not just a worry for Europe. It is also a major concern for Gambia where the departure of so many young men is now threatening the longterm future of numerous villages like Sabaa.gtGambia a former British colony on West Africas Atlantic coast is a case in point. gtIn the first quarter of  one in seven of the  migrants who crossed the Mediterranean were from Gambia. The village is used as an illustrative example. Thats the only way to get information that isnt just numbers.People like them are the subject of the talks between EU and African leaders that were Europes main news item just hours ago.,EuropeMeta,cwy8arr,9,t5_396na

6076301,1,t3_3yqbaq,Just for context there was the same habit here towards right wing people edit albeit not so severe as we see nowadays when reurope was still predominantly leftwing. Im also glad those times are over but the best solution in my opinion would still be removal of the comment downvote button altogether. As that is only possible by using an overlay one that can be circumvented  and Reddit has no functionality to shut it down  its best to make do with it for the time being.But I agree that it needs to go for comments everywhere I went where such a system was in existence or was introduced it immensely stimulated groupthink. It is a detrimental thing to discussions on large subreddits. ,EuropeMeta,cyg36pd,3,t5_396na

It doesnt mean that anyone ELSE has to listen to your bullshit  or host you while you share it If Youre yelled at boycotted have your show cancelled or get banned from an internet community your free speech rights arent being violated.

7545980,0,t3_4ilpfq,The thread you are linking to was removed because it is local news. At the same time the thread about the burqaniqab ban in one small and relatively insignificant town in Bulgaria was allowed to stay up. Both of these stories seem equally local to me and pretty unusual yet they were treated differently.If the mods want to nuke certain threads then at least be honest about the reasons. It is clear that the local news criterion is applied very selectively and not objectively.,EuropeMeta,d2zxw38,15,t5_396na

10795222,0,t1_ddtfywk,The flag I proposed is listed here  as a variant flag.A similar situation to Bavaria which also gets to have its variant flag as a flair  Which is also correct because the variant flag is much more unique and is more associated with Bavaria.These are both official flags. The only difference is that both Bavarian flags are civil flags as well while the current Hessian flag is the civil flag and my proposed one is the state flag. So they are used differently but they are both official.,EuropeMeta,ddtg80s,4,t5_396na
