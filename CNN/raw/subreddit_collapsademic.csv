11416409,0,t3_62yq1j,AbstractA rapidly growing body of research examines whether human conflict can be affected by climatic changes. Drawing from archaeology criminology economics geography history political science and psychology we assemble and analyze the  most rigorous quantitative studies and document for the first time a remarkable convergence of results. We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climates influence is substantial for each  standard deviation  change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises  and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises . Because locations throughout the inhabited world are expected to warm  to  by  amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical impact of anthropogenic climate change.,collapsademic,dfq1e9g,1,t5_3hqie
