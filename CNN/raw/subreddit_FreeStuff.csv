2390227,0,t3_2ms08q,This isnt free. This is a computer you buy. It does have XBMC which is free. However XBMC works on just about ANYTHING. I am currently running it on  Pis an Ouya  phones a tablet and of course my computer. If you want to watch TV for free all you need is XBMC. Dont get me wrong a pretty cool box. It is missing Bluetooth which is needed for me. How else can I use a remotecontroller without a dozen dongles? Still the price for what it is isnt bad. It just shouldnt be here. Seems much better then my Ouya though the price with no controllerremote sucks a bit it isnt bad for what it is. Or at least it would be with bluetooth dangit.If you posted it here as you are a member of the team such as they paid you to do ads   tell them to add bluetooth. Else it is useless as a set top box for alot of us. ,FreeStuff,cm750r3,2,t5_2qlrb
