Banking sounds like a good career path but it is not the only one that would work out if you put in the hard work.I also want to add and I cannot overstate this sometimes you will work a normal workday at a job with weekends off but the stress that comes with it could be crippling at times as well.  I am in software and the stress is through the roof almost every day.  Every problem is your problem and every new feature is not getting done fast enough.I suggest that whatever you get into balance the money and the stress.  Also it does not have to be your dream job  you can do almost anything if you excel at it and excelling at it requires practice and hard work.A read that might inspire you is The outliersI think this will give you some insight and inspire you on your career path and decisions.,work,cfwnpxi,2,t5_2qhne
523999,0,t3_2043nd,Im sorry for your situation. Ive never had to share a desk with a coworker but I did share an office with one one office two desks etc.. I was patient for  years before I reached my breaking point with of my coworkers chattiness sloppiness negative attitude and generally poor work ethic. After talking to my manager we converted an unused space to our conference room and converted our old conference room to my new office. Needless to say Im a lot happier now. You need your own space. Period.,work,cfzu1qc,2,t5_2qhne
1245970,0,t3_28che2,This sounds like a very important problem and Ive glad youve brought it to the attention of a national audience. What you need to do is talk to your manager immediately. While hes balancing the schedule of the two dozen people you work with or perhaps while hes running around trying to help you serve thousands of customers during the most busy time of the year insist on a private meeting with him to discuss you coworkers unethical private texting behavior. Make sure that B and J and O are working so the manager can interrupt their tasks and sit you all down in his office and inspect everyones phone for inappropriate text messages. While you all watch have the manager write up a policy that dictates how employees should act while communicating with each other on the phone. Words like desperate should not be allowed except in positive cases like I am desperate to hang out with M but then nobody should be allowed to say that that person is desperate to hang out with M because that becomes rude.Have these rules framed and hung in the break room along with other important information like the federal laws regarding discrimination. That way everyone will know how they are supposed to communicate with each and no one can possibly have their feelings hurt by another persons opinion. You can also suggest possible punishments for violations of those rules. Severe violations could result in termination while lesser violations could result in punishments like having to stay inside during recess detention or even calling their parents and having an after hours workerparent conference.If that doesnt work perhaps its time to not give a fuck and stop worrying about dumb shit. Just ignore it and carry on with your life. You have better things to worry about than childish behavior at a job that you probably wont have a year from now.,work,ci9scko,0,t5_2qhne

5932397,0,t3_3wivyy,In order for you to be able to do the janitorial job it sounds like you would have needed more than what they would consider to be reasonable accommodations for your disability as you need more time training than what theyre evidently accustomed to providing. OR they simply know very little about working with people with your sorts of issues. In either case it sounds like a job coach would be of help to you. Job coaches work alongside you to help you learn the job and to set up reminders or whatever youd need so that you could keep the job longterm. Agencies that employ job coaches to assist people often have relationships with local employers who are accustomed to working with job coaches.Perhaps this new job will work out great and youll never need the info but just in case... start checking into disability services available in your county city and state. There may also be private services available at a rehab facility for those with TBI for example that your insurance may cover or you could pay for privately if funds are available. Do a search for disability employment and the name of your city and state. edit Sorry I just reread your post and see that there was a job coach with you that day. Im surprised to hear they werent able to advocate for you to stay on and keep learning but perhaps they decided it wasnt a good environment for you and it was better to try somewhere else. Best of luck!,work,cxx9n9d,1,t5_2qhne

6765481,0,t3_48eex4,Youre allowed to hurt his life if for him life includes sexually harassing minors.  Go right the f back to your managers.  Youre being physically and verbally harassed incessantly by a man with whom even consensual sex would be illegal.  He signed a contract when he started working there that if he engaged in sexual misconduct at the workplace he could be fired.  He needs to be fired.  If hes texted you inappropriately at all show those as evidence.  If hes called you a lot show them your call history.  If you dont have any hard evidence show them this Reddit post.  Show them that you are reaching out anonymously online for helpthats not exactly dishonest behavior.  If they still think youre lying even as they read this then go ahead and skip to the third paragraph of this post.There is a strict protocol for how managers are supposed to handle claims of sexual harassment.  Im not  sure what it is as Im not a manager but I know its strict as hell.  If your manager for instance wants to go and get this guy and bring him into the office with you so you can all talk it overTHAT IS INAPPROPRIATE AND A BIGTIME NONO.  Do not let that happen.  Or if it starts to happen against your will get your phone out and record it.  Whatever happens next at least Justice will be watching.If your managers simply refuse to take you seriously and try to wave you off you have two options.  Neither is great.  One go over their heads call Corporate and let them know whats happening to you.  The upside of that option is you prevent this shit from happening anymore at your workplace.  Pretty big upside.  Option two  quit and go someplace better.  The upside of option two is you dont have to deal with a lot of really really heavy shit thats way over your head.  Pretty big upside.Its ultimately your call.  Sorry on behalf of adults for such a shitty introduction to adulthood.Keep us updated.,work,d0j5aq4,8,t5_2qhne
