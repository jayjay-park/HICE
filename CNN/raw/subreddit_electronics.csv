167035,0,t3_1w02eb,These are onewire electrodynamic sorry not sure if thats the industry term maybe voice powered? party line telephones. In short an electromagnet generates current directly from vocal vibrations and this current travels to an electromagnet in the speaker of the other phone. I believe the speaker and microphone were actually the same part my understanding is that youd yell into the horn to transmit and youd listen to the same horn to receive. Party line means that the phones in a neighborhood were all connected together to a single wire with the soil of the earth acting as the other conductor of the complete circuit. There were no numbers anyone could lift up the hook to hear what was being said on the line although the added load of an additional reciever would probably audibly mute the signal. Speaking of mute these systems were never more than neighborhood wide since the small output voltage of a voice powered phone means that the signal cant go far. Getting further into technical details each phone would consist of four basic parts the tranciever which as mentioned is similar to a speaker or electrodynamic microphone the induction coil the dynamo and the ringer. Im only going to describe the type of phone that has a single horn since its simpler conceptually. The first two components form the voice circuit and the latter two form the ringing circuit. In use the user cranks the dynamo to generate a large DC I think? Edit nope guess it was AC voltage which flows through the line and activates the ringers of all phones in the system. It was common practice to assign each party ring codes so if you wanted the Smiths youd ring two short rings and for the McCoys youd ring one long ring for instance. The bell works identically to your standard kitchen doorbell where an electromagnet draws a clapper against a bell and simultaneously breaks the circuit to release the clapper and start he cycle over. I actually might be wrong about this if the dynamo generates AC no interrupter would be necessary. When the voice circuit is switched in the output of the induction coil is attached to the line. The induction coil is a stepup transformer at least in the transmit direction its a step down in the receive direction. It serves to raise the transmitted voice voltage while lowering the available current. This makes the phone better at transmitting through long wires since the series resistance matters less so long as they are not supported too close to the ground or on leaky insulators in which case capacitance and resistance respectively would sap the strength of the already minute current. The tranciever connected to the induction coil which serves as the combination mic and speaker is a bit different from a modern speaker or mic. Rather than a Mylar diaphragm causing a fine copper coil to move through a magnetic field the telephone tranciever works kind of like an electromagnet picking up a nail or a moving magnet inducing a voltage in a coil. Basically a permanently magnetized split iron core think your standard cartoon U magnet but long and skinny is placed in close proximity to a thin steel diaphragm. The magnet is wound with wire like an electromagnet but much coarser wire than would be used in a modern speaker. When the current flows one way through this cool the field of the permanent magnet is aided attracting the diaphragm. Current flowing the other way fights the field releasing the diaphragm. This is all good but how can this device generate current? Basically sound pressure that pushes the diaphragm closer to the magnet allows more magnetic field to flow through the air gap between the magnet and the diaphragm increasing the total field through the copper coil. Sound pressure that sucks the diaphragm away reduces the field flux which means less field goes through the coil. This change in flux causes induction in the copper coil generating voltage which drives current through the induction coil which steps up the voltage in order to supply current to the long line wire. This voice current is what ultimately constitutes the transmitted signal. Edit see discussion with JimJones below I was wrong about the voice powered phone being the one in the article. Sounds like by the time period being discussed the phones were likely battery powered and using the Blake Transmitter So replace the transmitter above with Blake transmitter plus battery. Also note that the voice powered system I describe probably sans induction coil was definitely around for a short time google butterstamp phone and coffin phone the latter used both voice powered transmitters and battery powered transmitters. ,electronics,cexgijz,7,t5_2qhue

195870,0,t1_cf0oxhb,Im sorry but your comment on the bandwidth is completely off base. The quoted MHz bandwidth is in absolutely on way a realistic figure for this scope. The Nyquist rate is a theoretical minimum sampling rate for a signal. Any real application requires between  and  samples per hertz. This puts the true usable bandwidth at MHz. My Rigol DSE with a MHz bandwidth has a claimed GSs sampling rate. I say claimed because I simply dont know the true figured to back that. My point is that the claimed figure is being thrown out there by someone who either doesnt understand whats actually required for a true signal representation or by someone who knows and doesnt care because this is going to reinvent what we already know or by someone who has somehow developed a whole new method to signal analysis that nobody has ever come across.

Dont be afraid to have a battery outside the unit stick it under the desk where no one can see it. Those small riding lawnmower batteries would probably work too.

1336850,0,t3_29dt10,On the assumption that its a microcontroller using the pot to vary the duty cycle of a pwm signal or frequency I would think that is a bit overkill as you could achieve the same with a couple  timers or opamps fairly easilycheaply. The Atari punk console is a good example of this using   timers to give variable duty cycle and frequency and a wide range of dirty sounds. With a few opamps you could just as easily set up an array of squaretrianglesine wave oscillators in the same way of variable frequencies. That being said all is a good learning experience though you might try to give into the more analog side of sound the glorious opamp gladly awaits your arrival. EDIT Of course you could use the microcontroller to produce some complex sound patterns youll most likely have a hard time getting too complex and be fairly limited to square or filtered pwm with the current setup it looks like. And adding another pot to be able control both frequency and duty cycle wouldnt hurt as a wider range of sound but that is mostly preference.EDIT  The first sound creating project was an annoying square wave generator I dont think Ive had nearly as much fun with anything so small.

1849654,0,t1_ckc2ujw,ampampampSection . Abstract algebra of article  Algebra sfw gtgtAbstract algebra extends the familiar concepts found in elementary algebra and arithmetic of numbers to more general concepts. Here are listed fundamental concepts in abstract algebra.gtSets Rather than just considering the different types of numbers abstract algebra deals with the more general concept of sets a collection of all objects called elements selected by property specific for the set. All collections of the familiar types of numbers are sets. Other examples of sets include the set of all twobytwo matrices the set of all seconddegree polynomials ax  bx  c the set of all two dimensional vectors in the plane and the various finite groups such as the cyclic groups which are the groups of integers modulo n. Set theory is a branch of logic and not technically a branch of algebra.gtBinary operations The notion of addition  is abstracted to give a binary operation  say. The notion of binary operation is meaningless without the set on which the operation is defined. For two elements a and b in a set S a  b is another element in the set this condition is called closure Addition  subtraction  multiplication  and division  can be binary operations when defined on different sets as are addition and multiplication of matrices vectors and polynomials.gtIdentity elements The numbers zero and one are abstracted to give the notion of an identity element for an operation. Zero is the identity element for addition and one is the identity element for multiplication. For a general binary operator  the identity element e must satisfy a  e  a and e  a  a. This holds for addition as a    a and   a  a and multiplication a    a and   a  a. Not all sets and operator combinations have an identity element for example the set of positive natural numbers   ... has no identity element for addition.gtInverse elements The negative numbers give rise to the concept of inverse elements. For addition the inverse of a is written a and for multiplication the inverse is written a. A general twosided inverse element a satisfies the property that a  a   and a  a   .gtAssociativity Addition of integers has a property called associativity. That is the grouping of the numbers to be added does not affect the sum. For example           . In general this becomes a  b  c  a  b  c. This property is shared by most binary operations but not subtraction or division or octonion multiplicationgtCommutativity Addition and multiplication of real numbers are both commutative. That is the order of the numbers does not affect the result. For example       . In general this becomes a  b  b  a. This property does not hold for all binary operations. For example matrix multiplication and quaternion multiplication are both noncommutative.gtCombining the above concepts gives one of the most important structures in mathematics a group A group is a combination of a set S and a single binary operation  defined in any way you choose but with the following propertiesgtgt An identity element e exists such that for every member a of S e  a and a  e are both identical to a.gt Every element has an inverse for every member a of S there exists a member a such that a  a and a  a are both identical to the identity element.gt The operation is associative if a b and c are members of S then a  b  c is identical to a  b  c.gtIf a group is also commutative is for any two members a and b of S a  b is identical to b  athen the group is said to be abeliangtFor example the set of integers under the operation of addition is a group. In this group the identity element is  and the inverse of any element a is its negation a. The associativity requirement is met because for any integers a b and c a  b  c  a  b  cgtThe nonzero rational numbers form a group under multiplication. Here the identity element is  since   a  a    a for any rational number a. The inverse of a is a since a  a  .gtThe integers under the multiplication operation however do not form a group. This is because in general the multiplicative inverse of an integer is not an integer. For example  is an integer but its multiplicative inverse is  which is not an integer.gtThe theory of groups is studied in group theory A major result in this theory is the classification of finite simple groups mostly published between about  and  which separates the finite simple groups into roughly  basic types.gtSemigroups quasigroups and monoids are structures similar to groups but more general. They comprise a set and a closed binary operation but do not necessarily satisfy the other conditions. A semigroup has an associative binary operation but might not have an identity element. A monoid is a semigroup which does have an identity but might not have an inverse for every element. A quasigroup satisfies a requirement that any element can be turned into any other by either a unique leftmultiplication or rightmultiplication however the binary operation might not be associative.gtAll groups are monoids and all monoids are semigroups.gtGroups just have one binary operation. To fully explain the behaviour of the different types of numbers structures with two operators need to be studied. The most important of these are rings and fieldsgtA ring has two binary operations  and  with  distributive over . Under the first operator  it forms an abelian group. Under the second operator  it is associative but it does not need to have identity or inverse so division is not required. The additive  identity element is written as  and the additive inverse of a is written as a.gtDistributivity generalises the distributive law for numbers and specifies the order in which the operators should be applied called the precedence For the integers a  b  c  a  c  b  c and c  a  b  c  a  c  b and  is said to be distributive over .gtThe integers are an example of a ring. The integers have additional properties which make it an integral domaingtA field is a ring with the additional property that all the elements excluding  form an abelian group under . The multiplicative  identity is written as  and the multiplicative inverse of a is written as a.gtThe rational numbers the real numbers and the complex numbers are all examples of fields.gtInteresting algebra | algebra | Abstract algebra | Algebra over a field Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckcuoy oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckcuoy.

1973086,0,t3_2h98md,If youre a first year most of the stuff the other guys here are suggesting is a bit high level...at least when I was a first year I think it wouldve been a bit crazy to build a power supply or a DAC.Here is a pretty cool project which you could effectively rework as a lab. It would be plagiarizing if you stole the design completely but if you notice there is some stuff about this one that can be reworked since it basically just revolves around the Pong chip  and some other easy stuff. You could set this up to take a V battery instead of using a power supply save  now but have to keep buying Vs. As for the cost the majority of this one is cheap and you could do it for around  at minimum and at the end you have a pretty sweet pong game you can play on your TV.I wanted to do this one all summer but never got the chance. If you decide to do this and want any explanation as to why you have to do certain things in the circuit message me. I can help you out.If that seems a bit complex or it needs to be analog only no digital gates I could give you a few more ideas. Some simple ones might be an LED array that responds to music volume or if you have a lot of time possibly even a LED array that responds to music frequency volume i.e.  Hz volume  Hz volume  Hz volume  Hz volume  Hz volume  Hz volume all with their own  LEDs.It really depends what you want to do but you have a lot of options. The sky is the limit and it also depends whether or not you wanna have the coolest circuit in class lol.,electronics,ckqyh0l,1,t5_2qhue

2706012,0,t1_cnbn166,Im curious why you would suggest that there was an intent to prevent foreigners from knowing about the deals. In my experience Im far more accustomed to being given free samples without asking or offered discounts just because Im a foreigner. Thats something that has been happening to me for decades. I always seem to find people bending over backwards to make a connection with a foreign customer so I find the notion of sneaky Chinese only offering deals to each other hard to fathom.Im not suggesting Chinese business people are saints. They most certainly are not and neither are their brethren in any other cultures. There is a long history of gouging and price fixing in China. The Opium Wars for instance were really a kind of false flag operation initiated by the Chinese sellers of opium to drive up prices. There are hundreds of cases of price fixing in semiconductors but I dont think this reflects a Chinesespecfic characteristic. The Chinese culture is very open and welcoming to foreigners who actively engage with it and there is a long history of that which predates our current era by centuries.Let me just point out that when the Jesuits developed active relations with China in the th Century they were initially greeted with great honor and given lavish gifts. The emperor officially created an edict to actively legalize the practice of Christianity simply on the basis of his impression of the missionaries. Were talking about an incredibly open and liberal society that embraced foreigners with very little hesitation. It was Pope Clement XI who actively cut the ties to China because he felt they were corrupting the missionaries.   ,electronics,cnbnw19,2,t5_2qhue

3095405,0,t1_coi1zur,I have a question about that video. Most guides to soldering stress how important it is to heat the component lead and the pad and then let them melt the solderthe impression many give is that I should not be touching the unmelted solder directly to the tip. On the other hand most guides are not about SMT soldering.Is SMT different in that regard? Or did I just misunderstand what Im seeing in the video? It looked like most of the time the tip was being applied directly to the solder and squished down onto the lead and never directly heating the pad. Does the very small size of the leads and pad mean that everything is going to get adequately heated with SMT no matter where the tip is applied especially when the tip is big and flat?,electronics,coiu5w3,1,t5_2qhue

However if you want a few absolutely basic pointers on how they work look up an introduction to microcontrollers.The basics are that you have digital io pins for writingreading highlow voltage for whats called logic. Youve got analog input pins for reading variable voltages often useful for sensors. All components have datasheets which are useful sets of information on specs and usage. There are different protocols for communication such as UART usb for your computer serial SPI and ic. Microprocessors typically are programmed over serial so you need to use a UART to serial converter to program them this is the whole reason people use Arduino and other development boards they break out the digital and analog pins for easy access and have integrated power management and UARTserial converters so you can just slap that puppy into a USB slot on your laptop and tell it what to do by downloading a program youve written in whats called an IDE an interactive development environment.

Youll save more money time and inconvenience than you can imagine if you slowly build these skills. It will also build an eye and habit for taking care of your electronics. An answer Your charger is not going to operate correctly unless that severed wire is securely attached to itself again. The video you linked about fixing it without a soldering iron will work but I wouldnt recommend opening the brick if you can avoid it because the brick part stores electricity even after its unplugged and you can quickly hurt yourself or break the charger. These things are a fire hazard when professionals build them be careful. ,electronics,cri967v,3,t5_2qhue

They would be dimmer so Im not sure they would be as effective.And you probably might get away with going to a  amp fuse. To handle  amps safely here is the minimum suggested wire gauge needed to avoid melt down. Look at the column marked Maximum amps for chassis wiring and read across to see that  amps should have about  gauge wire. That doesnt mean  gauge wire throughout the whole thing that just means  gauge wire up to the fuse block. As the wires break out to the loads they all have less current. You might find you already have  gauge to your block so it is safe for a  amp fuse.But first prove that the fog lights are the issue.And you said you had a meter being delivered?

6063655,0,t1_cyecejq,Exactly!This voltage threshold is know as the forward voltage drop. For normal standart silicon diodes it is around .V while for leds it will be in the v area. There are however a lot of specific purpose diodes with higher voltage drops such as v which can be used to limit the voltage in a specific part of the circuit. I am simplifying here but basically if the voltage surpasses the forward voltage drop the extra energy is let through and dumped into the ground rail. These are normally called zener diodes.,electronics,cyefsc3,2,t5_2qhue
6141433,0,t1_cynlcam,Do you think clock drift is really that significant?  He is trying to measure  Hz.  General clocks may be like  PPM so after  million seconds you have a  seconds drift or like . error.  From what I saw with a quick search on the net the RPi is about  ppm.  Given you allowed a  millions seconds of collection he would have around  million zero crossings.  I imagine the estimated frequency would still be pretty accurate.  gt The mains frequency is sufficiently longterm accurate that you can use the mains to measure how accurate your crystal is!Could you elaborate on what you mean?  I would think that the mains frequency is much more unstable in a PPM sense than the oscillator on the board.  The power grid is constantly under going load changes.  Sure if you integrate over a long enough period of time a peak would show at  Hz.  I dont think it would be a dirac but something with some bandwidth that encapsulates the drift.  Another way to think of this is that the drift is smearing the energy across the spectrum.I would actually steer clear of the Beaglebone.  That would be like using a jackhammer as a can opener.  I agree that they have made it a powerful platform but it is a hassle to configure.  That is way the RPi got so popular IMO.  Plug and go.,electronics,cynpt9b,7,t5_2qhue

It plays wav files off an SD card for the alarm but while its doing that via an interrupt you cant write to the display.If your eink display is just bit  MHz SPI might be OK.,electronics,d1anpoq,3,t5_2qhue

Needham Electronics EMP and EMP We have several of these units around. However the softwares comparability with Windows versions later than XP is hit or miss. Also compatibility with USB to IEEE  printer cables is questionable. Its getting harder to find a computer thatll run this natively.Another option is the Needham Electronics EMP that has a USB port and compatibility with Windows XP. However there are few of these units available. Again the software is flaky on newer versions of Windows.Now I have my option... A relic that I dug up from a storage room. Its a Data IO  programmer. It interfaces with RS and works well on USB to Serial converter cables. It also works under ANY OS that has a terminal emulator program set to  N with software flow control. I have tested with my desktop running Windows  and my laptop running LUbuntu ..My problem is uploading my HEX file to the unit.Currently I use PuTTY to connect.

I managed to detect a mW laser spot at a m range roughly it may detect further but Im still playing around with it. As its an IR laser its inherently unsafe as you cant tell if its burning your eyes out no blink reflex so Im pretty wary of increasing the power even for these low powers Im wearing safety goggles because I like my vision. Im currently working on IR LEDs and columating their light to make IR spotlights. Other better ways to increase range would be to play around with the amplifier bandwidthamplification the frequency of the pulsed laser improve analogue circuitry noise isolation on the PCB in a later version etc.Second. Yeah Im not sure I was thinking its bordering on dangerous in the wrong hands. On the other hand I was thinking of strapping it on the bottom of my quadcopter anyway. I dont think it would be that hard to make it follow the laser spot so long as the gimbal tracking is robust enough. famous last words.

11092228,0,t1_deopdlt,Theres nothing inherently wrong with the design of the helping hands. The main problem is the cost of the unit has been driven down and so has the quality. The ones you could get in the late s and early s were pretty good. The best way to fix something is solve the problems not find another set of problems ,electronics,depaljs,1,t5_2qhue
11093035,0,t1_depd17t,Maybe you should set up a club recruit  members sell them a product they enjoy and run a community around it. Because your purple dogshitthemed products would all be really cheap youd soon be able to get loads more customers and Boldport would go out of business so youd be happy.

11181449,0,t1_dezdyxf,Yeah we have assembled boards shipped to us test them and do final product assembly onsite. The battery cert actually wasnt that bad. Expensive but not otherwise painful. We just paid our battery supplier a bunch of money to get it certified. For some reason they couldnt certify the base cell or let us share a cert with another customer. We might have been the only one using the model we bought. Who knows.For the California battery charging system cert we paid a lab in Georgia  and mailed them a unit with wires connected to the battery sticking out of a hole in the housing. A week later they said it was good and then mailed us our unit back. Now we have our product in a special database and can sell it in California.There are additional assembly steps after the board test. We do final functional testing including testing the button tuning our analog frontend and testing our bluetooth radio.,electronics,dezekrb,10,t5_2qhue

11314984,0,t1_dfdx1g3,Awesome reply D Yeah like I said Im not all that great on knowledge when it comes to radiation beyond the basics. One thing I did learn when looking this stuff up is that those medical XRay devices actually have aluminum shielding to stop lower energy XRays as they would be absorbed by the patient. What they want are mostly higher energy XRays so most of them pass throughat just the right distance. Makes sense when you think about it its just something Ive never thought about. Kinda the opposite of radiation therapy where you want the radiation to be absorbed at just the right distance so you want weakerish particle.s However the radiation produced by medical XRay images not CT stuff just like an arm xray is fairly minimal well absorbed by you as a human. Of course thats just for a fraction of a second but its also directly targeted at you. gt It was a sufficient concern in older color TVs that older TVs include an xray protection circuit to prevent overvoltage on their rectifier tube.I believe this was mostly fixed in the s or s or something though wasnt it? Also wasnt there a scare a while back that CRTs were irradiating our eyes? Which was totally overblown due to how little they emit and how the safety circuitry is made? Again radiation is completely out of my element so pardon me if Im totally wrong p gt Measuring it is not so simple. Geiger counters have a complicated response curve to xrays of different energies though. The readings being accurate only for a certain range of photon energies something like cs so you can roughly check your Fukushima or Chernobyl fallout.Yeah this one is completely true. However they will still detect XRays to a somewhat meaningful level just for a youtube video. Not to get super accurate readings but enough for curiositys sake. Afaik if it can detect gammas it can detect Xrays for the most part right? Like this one I linked Well I think it only detect xrays with a certain energy which I think was your point? Side note Photonic used that same model to pick up xrays from a vacuum tube. I knew it looked familiar. LinkAnyway learned a bit thanks for the reply! ,electronics,dfeja9c,1,t5_2qhue
