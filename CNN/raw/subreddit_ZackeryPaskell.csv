5640412,0,t3_3kyo9g,As an aside this is actually somewhat of a derivation from a much larger concept regarding harmony thats gonna take some time to work out.While the above is written in terms of for example Iii or Vvi what were really seeing here is an Ionianspecialized way of saying Major to minor when the roots lie a major second apart.

Motion by step from a diminished chord is only accounted for here when leading into a major chord and chains of such arent accounted for either.,ZackeryPaskell,cww8wvq,1,t5_36225
