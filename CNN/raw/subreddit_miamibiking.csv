Youll want to park in the Publix shopping plaza there as its free and any parking on the OTHER side of the bridge on AA will get expensive. The roads are only sketchy through Ft. Lauderdale. North of that and it calms down a bit. I mean its still a road with cars but not the crazy traffic of AA in Ft. Laud. Wonder where ya live that you think the roads here are better. I love riding up north. Depends on where up north is I guess. Have fun though! At least youll be warm!,miamibiking,dd1pwwn,2,t5_2vyw6
