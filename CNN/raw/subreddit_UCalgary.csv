767538,0,t3_22skjq,ART   History of Video Games with Rob Furr. He kinda takes too long with some topics and some of it feels irrelevant but its very interesting if you really like video games. Plus you actually get course credit for playing games youve never played before. Robs a funny guy but kinda crude sometimes. BIOL   Medicinal Plant Biochemistry. Biosci majors can take this starting third year. Its a pretty technical course to begin with. You go over how plants make various compounds so theres quite a bit of pathways to memorize. Theres quite a bit of work as well two presentations and two term papers I believe but its worth it for the second half when you start talking about illegal drugs with Dr. Facchini. Hes a pretty big researcher in the field of commercial morphine and opiate synthesis but hes also got a ton of knowledge on illicit synthesis. Hence his classes are always full of crazy stories about going on ridealongs during busts visiting opium fields in the Middle East etc. Plus hes a fun guy who brought us all beers one time.As for particular profs its worth taking any PHYS courses taught by Jason Donev and any DRAM or ART courses taught by Pat Finn. Pat Finn in particular is notorious for giving out easy As and teaching easy springsummer courses. The only work you ever have to do in his classes is seeing plays and drama productions. ,UCalgary,cgrivj7,1,t5_2spfj
876143,0,t1_ch3uiip,You obviously werent around when we defeated against the market modifiers. Of the long list of programs the UofC lobbied to see increases in all but the business faculty modifiers were deemed off base by the Minister of Advanced Education. If youre a business student the  increase sucks but outside of Scurfield Hall its nothing.As far as seeing nothing back you couldnt possibly be more incorrect. The HSB market modifiers are structured thusly  returned the the faculty already can be seen in tech improvements and the restructuring of the undergrad program  to University general revenues to offset program delivery costs in other faculties... I dont necessarily agree with this  spun out into income and academicbased bursaries to Haskayne students the single most real way HSB students will be seeing dimes of it backThe UofC is considering pushing again on the engineering faculty but thats the limit of what you may see. And you can bet the ESS SU and CAUS will be right there to stop it.The loophole still exists but its been neutered.You can also directly thank the SU for the fact that tuition is pegged to CPI. Prior to that very successful lobbying effort tuition was wholly free market in Alberta.You can hate all you want on the SUs financial motivations wasted spending etc and youll get quite a bit of agreement from me but they are a highlyeffective lobbying organization.,UCalgary,ch3vdmv,-1,t5_2spfj

I think there are a vocal group of students who have a flawed understanding of what engineering actually is. Its entirely true that building a Rube Goldberg machine out of cardboard hardly counts as engineering but the design process involved when you are working under changing conditions time pressures budget restraints team conflict etc. Are exactly what engineers do all the time. On a real engineering project you wouldnt be building what you designed anyways. I keep hearing that this was  of the course and the demo was marked as a fail if you didnt complete the requirements. Was the demonstration truely the only thing they cared about? They should be giving equal if not more marks allocated to the design and the documentation of that design.

Im in year A lot of contributing factors first year inexperience a general lack of effort bad ACCT  prof. When I did SGMA I had to do  quizzes that consisted of memorizing lists and definitions. You had to get no less than  I think on any test and if you did youd have to at least average  across all  tests. I flunked the first one so I had to do extrememly well on the next two. My group was also incompetent so Im sure we got ripped apart on our paper. Grading scale was also messed with Bs in the s and Cs in the s. I got C in that class.MGST was okay since I took it with friends. Sorta skimmed through the assignments since my friends did th majority of the work and I forgot to study databases for the final. Got B in that class mostly due to my lack of effort.ACCT was just hard. I had Darrin the first semester he taught and his teaching just didnt mesh with me. Had a bunch of stuff on powerpoints and tried to do the questions with the class which were already completed on the slides so he was essentially explaining the process without actually walking us through it. Quizzes got noticeably tougher. Got  on the first one thinking I was doing alright and the entire class went on a steady decline where we were averaging  on the last couple. Got wrecked on the final since it was the last day PM and I got wrecked by Bank Recs. I open the sheet read the question and was like Boom minus  marks My head hurt after that final as well. Got CSTAT was hard but I had Robinson and put effort into it so I got B which was higher than my  grade. The final is them giving you minitab outputs with missing bits and you have to decide which test to do and figure out z values and intervals.Econ  with Tracey thats self explanatory.Now youre gonna read all this and think Im incompetent but I have turned it around.

Its also normally only offered once per year in the winter term so if the need to retake it arises your options are much more limited compared to needing to retake CPSC  which is always offered both fall and winter and this year is being offered in spring too.  ,UCalgary,dg97nip,2,t5_2spfj

11806777,0,t3_68gtz2,In short Dont CPSC  does not teach you coding basics. Its a UNIX course which contains everything youll learn in CPSC  anyway except bloated. The things you learn in the course are just a small part of  so it doesnt help much to know more about it. When I started in Computer Science I didnt have any coding background but CPSC  and  for majors teach you everything you need to know from the start. So dont worry if you have no background in programming. As long as you know how to use a keyboard and mouse youll be good to go.  ,UCalgary,dgyc7jf,11,t5_2spfj
