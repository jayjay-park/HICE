7458,0,t1_cefa0sm,Maybe I can answer this. I am close to your age  and film and video production has been my source of employment for  years and a hobby for . I have mostly been the technical director for live sports broadcasts. But I also do weddingcommercial and some longer promo and information videos for various groups around my community. I was surprised by the amount of photo and stills works I needed. On a daily basis I am creating many different items in photoshop then bringing them into premiere or after effects. If you plan to freelance or just want a more varied skill set I cant stress enough the importance of learning basic graphic design skills. A tacky lower third or title screen can really give a bad impression regardless of how good the content is. So I recommend getting the entire creative suite If you can afford it.

Ive worked on computers built by a producer with fairly impressive specs but it crashed on me all the time because Lord knows why. Ive worked with alienware computers that crashed all the time with premiere again not sure why. Ive worked with Hp workstations that really impressed me with stability. I think what Im getting at is dont go with pc because you can save money. A pc built from cheaper hardware will be less stable than a mac trust me Ive had to deal with those frustrations.

654443,0,t1_cgdicah,Thank you for your help and insightful reply!The reason I want to use the HF R is because I do not have any way to record the audio either with the Ti or externally. I am quite the amateur and mainly focused on photography but I have been working with a local news website and he wants to know if I can record sitdown interviews.I had started video as a hobby mainly local bands. I originally used two FSs and bought the HF R cheap to upgrade to HD video but decided to buy the Ti to focus on photography especially since it also took great video I was originally going to buy another HFR weverything before I decided to buy the Ti back then. But things happened and money has become really tight so I havent bought any really great accessories for the Ti Ive just been taking photos and slowly learning and building a portfolio. Then this job came up and Ive been trying to do as much as I reliably can.Youve really given me a lot to think about though and Im now weighing my options. Luckily the job this weekend has been postponed due to weather and that gives me some more time to figure out what Im going to do. Money is a major issue for me and them and theyre going to get what they pay for even if that means using the HFR. I want to do my best and this is a great learning experience for me as well as good exposure as the site is gaining some attention due to the subjects they are covering.I do not have great video editing software but hadnt really thought about seeing what software the site ownerpublisherhead honchos computer may have or seeing if my friends software whose computer I was planing to use to edit could import the files. Ive just started taking pictures for the site recently and as I said I would like to do as much as I reliably can.You have made me think about trying to use the Ti though and maybe its time I really thought about getting the things I need to make that happen. I would just like to be able to use the HFR as fallbackbecause I have it and I know if I could get the video files from the camcorder then I could at least meet the basic requirements of what they want you should see what camcorder he has and at least get the ball rolling.Again thanks for your insight I was just feeling a little lost and wanted to know if the PIXELA download was correct or if there was some way I could not have to pay to import the HFRs files. ,VideoEditing,cgenrq4,1,t5_2ri0h

1004851,0,t3_25lr37,gt I have two audio clips on a time line that extend about  hours.. hour sequence tends to fuck things up.  There are posts here and on Premieres forum too often.There really isnt a good reason for a  hour timeline unless you are trying to torture somebody with  hour videos with no pee breaks in which case I am all for it.Your raw footage should live in your project panel organized to make sense to you.  You should not be dumping all of your footage into a sequence just to view it. That is what the source panel is for.In general the timeline is for is for assembling an edited program together or a sequence  an edited section of a larger program.Throwing hours and hours of RAW footage randomly into a sequence just to view it in the program monitor is something I see with very inexperienced editing software users .After all that is the workflow for the most basic cheap grandma friendly editing software like Windows Movie maker and iMovie Throwing big clips down and whittling away pieces.

1112559,0,t3_26tx5n,It seems obvious but sadly it doesnt work terribly well.A difference blend mode like overlay or screen generates the difference between the foreground and background. If you drop this clip on itself its totally black because theres no difference. When your talent walks in theres a difference  the problem is its not enough of a difference in spots to be perfect. For example the brightness of skintone is going to be close to the brightness of the wall. And while its obvious to our brains its less obvious to the software. Yes the brightness is similar of skin...and the color isnt stored terribly well in video  so the difference isnt great enough.If its already shot someone has to do the separation of the talent by hand  and thats called Rotoscoping. Adobe After Effects has a tool that does some of the hard work but is far from perfect and is called the RotoBrush.The TLDR version? Its obvious to our brains but the software doesnt do the work well enough. ,VideoEditing,chur8fz,1,t5_2ri0h

The first few years are a bit more demanding but as time goes on the price of hardware to handle projects becomes a lot less. Most editors I know now just work off of SSDs so their hard drive readwrite speed becomes a non issue. That being said the processing power for video in HD might not be an issue on a newer machine.  I would actually argue it might be cheaper now to edit in K than when HD was becoming a standard back in the late s to early s.

Film with the lens at FF and make sure you prefocus on the horizon.The Canon mm IS is much sharper and can be had for very cheap. If you need a longer lens the Canon mm IS is a very good telephoto lens. Both of these offer great sharpness at F. and up. which should be plenty for well lit scenes.If you want some inexpensive quality glass I found the Tamron mm F. to be a great lens at around  new or  new with IS. Both are cheaper than the Canon mm but unlike the Canon the Tamron can work with FF cameras.Your issue with image quality is glass related but doesnt require you to go out and buy a bunch of L lenses.

So if you want to convince them the very best way is to bring in editors ideally who do the same kind of work that you do now and who have already made the transition  and let your current editors talk to them. What convinced most of us is not comparing project against project. But six months into the switch looking up and realizing that we were getting home for dinner most nights and not having to work through weekends any more. Oh and have the current learners ask the X cutters how they feel now when they have to cut on something else. Most of them I talk to will.

The iMac has a laptop quality video card inside a  shell and youre looking at  to start with a Mac Pro granted with a much more capable machine. You can get a great Hackintosh for  more or less depending on your needs but the downside is you dont get official Apple support if something goes wrong and youre a bit limited in terms of compatible parts for your build.Alternatively if you like using official Mac products too much to want to leave and I wouldnt blame you! the proxy workflow that was suggested makes sense.If youre interested in the Hackintosh route Google tonymacx.,VideoEditing,clqwz6l,5,t5_2ri0h

Because the most critical thing will be to go through everything scene by scene and do two things. A use the notes field to explain the who what and why of each element. And B range keyword everything for easy sort and retrieval. If you just get all that done step by strp scene by scene at your own pace  you can then either turn the edit over to someone to finish and save a fortune because of how well organized it is or do your own cut for fun and see how it turns out.

It sounds like you probably have a lot of material and while it wasnt purposeful while you were shooting you can try and find a purpose within it. Spend some serious time going through with an open mindset and see if there are any themes you can findmake and work out from there. I dont really have any particular techniques in mind but a montage by definition advances a story or them with little to no dialogue. Try to create a story or larger message with what you have rather than trying to simply make a prettier sequence of shots.

3187919,0,t3_2wlg1k,There are several painful moments with DSLR video.  Audio form the camera is useless. You need to shoot dual audio in most cases which means a second recording on set. As the editor you have to sync each take yes Adobe Premiere Pro and fcpx can do this shot by shot and Pluraleyes can do many shots but its more work.  The cameras shoot in h.  a codec that taxes systems. Newer systems and software do fine with it but if your system is  years old or more it may struggle a little.  The h. codec from these cameras is only soso for storage of color information youll have a more difficult time chromakeyingcolor correcting it.  DSLR shooters tend to be worse DPs and rely on the cameralens to produce a good picture. Shadows are more likely to be noisier.None of this takes away from the fact that DSLRs really were are a revolution in shooting  being able to work with interchangeable lenses gave more of a filmic look than prior cameras.,VideoEditing,cosfexf,2,t5_2ri0h

3474184,0,t3_300ucu,The thing is when you get into media production there are a whole host of reasons to choose OS X over Windows and thats mostly because the media production industry grew up around Macs and thus there are a lot of little tools out there that dont have Windows equivalents.So you lose out on the Digital Rebellion tools for rapid project deployment and NLE troubleshooting which can be vital if youre not too familiar with the inner workings of whatever NLE youre using. You lose the ability to make ProRes files entirely except with utilities using unlicensed encoders which our clients expressly forbid. You get a watered down version of MPEG Streamclip. You completely discard any possibility of using Final Cut Pro. You also give up the chance for fiveday turnaround on any work done on the machine.Also if this is going to be a work machine even if you do buy Windows Id get a proper workstation not a consumer desktop.

4069814,0,t1_crjz071,gt Thanks for your response! I definitely see your point about all the intensive processes going on but as a point of conversation its coming in at the very least x real time. Just because I mentioned three things doesnt mean that its going to scale at x. h. is VERY intensive for editorial systems which is why you might try converting to cineform. Who cares if you how long your export takes if you do it overnight?According to people I talk to at Adobe  GB is where you want to start   or more might be useful  especially if you have other software open like Chrome and its processor eating capabilities.An SSD will make the largest difference in accessing cache files.While you feel your hardware is Mid to top and should be expected to play better  I see systems with Xeons and  GB of ram with two SSDs....This may be the best performance you get out of Adobe Premiere Pro  and the biggest slowdown may very well be the fisheye effect.If I were working in a professional pipeline and knew I was going to remove the fisheye AND for delivery speed knew I was going to also do a transcode to ProRes or Cineform Id likely do the followingCopy the media and transcode overnight to Cineform AND add the fisheye removal to every shot. Likely Id use a second computer. Meanwhile I could edit with the copy of the media. The next day when the transcoded cleaned up footage was done I could swap.This workflow would give me immediate editorial AND higher speed export.,VideoEditing,crk6q4h,0,t5_2ri0h
4080439,0,t3_37aqrt,AfterEffects could be an option for you. You could use a plugin called CompsFromSpreadsheets to manage your footage using Microsoft Excel.  AfterEffects also uses expressions a scripting language that will drive properties including frame rate time remapping or ramping between speeds.

4381777,0,t3_3b7dgy,Yes but I dont think its a good idea. Basically you could go through the process of creating a DVD with menus etc but output it to a folder instead of a disc. Youll end up with two folders a VIDEOTS and an AUDIOTS folder. Put those two folders into a folder and tell the client to open that folder with almost any media player.I imagine it would be better just to give them the individual video files for them to peruse. ,VideoEditing,csjk93q,1,t5_2ri0h
4395957,0,t3_3bbytf,Like many others have said yeah After Effects is your best bet. Understandably that a pretty big investment but you can always get the trial version if this is a one off deal. Reason for that is Premiere Pro is an NLE while After Effects is video composition these are two very distinct roles and purposes. But I digress again After Effects is your best bet. Better yet given you have the ability to do so would be to reshoot the scene with different cups. As good as After Effects can be it is almost always better to reshoot the scene. As far as colorkey goes that really more for greenscreening stuff so that definitely not what you want unless you want to make the cups go away which you can do if you key it red but I hope nothing else is red in your scene in that case. There a reason why greenscreen are green or for outside blue. ,VideoEditing,csl5reh,1,t5_2ri0h

They obviously took their time because the light changes drastically overall and dramatically between the two sides of many of the edit points. They could have shot a bunch with one long take. Then stopped shooting turned off the camera to eat some lunch  remember more gear that they needed to shoot and then shoot more takes with additional gear dropping into frame so long as the camera was left stationary.

From there I refine audio color and of course effects. It can often be a back an forth process but the idea is not to spend time on something that doesnt get rendered.I think that a lot of making a movie or video is about this back and forth workflow because every element has to support each other and that is very time consuming. At some point you just run out of time or budget and you have to package and release your end product.It is a very good idea to do some preproduction so you have a general idea about the end product so you dont get lost in the back and forth limbo.,VideoEditing,cx28squ,2,t5_2ri0h

5709377,0,t3_3tb9tt,Id ask in rvideography too for shooting tips. Most folks here arent professionals so they may not have a ton of tips or tricks for you in the shooting department.Shooting technicalDepending on the camera youre using what kind of footage youre shooting and your experience level being able to run everything in manual mode will generally produce better video in the end. Youre a better judge than the camera is about whats in focus or if it should shift focus because something fluttered in front of the lens or if it should change exposure levels because someone wearing a dark shirt stepped in next to a guy wearing a neutral shirt. Automatic controls can ruin your footage.When manually focusing you should zoom in all the way and focus on the subjects eyes. This will ensure that no matter what zoom level youre using theyll be in focus. The more you zoom in and the wider your fstop the shallower your focus will be. Heres a good writeup about depth of fieldAlways rewhite balance every time any lighting changes at all. If your camera offers a black balance feature you should do that too. If your camera offers zebra stripes you should use them. If theyre  stripes then you should make sure that for example the shiny spot on your subjects forehead is striping but wouldnt if you were one stop down. If your camera offers focus peaking you should use that too. Its recommended that you use a viewfinder rather than a flipout screen even if its black and white because that will give you a much better impression of whether or not your footage is properly exposed. Itll also help keep you from being distracted by anything other than what youre shooting.Also make sure someone is monitoring your stuff when youre shooting. Someone needs to be watching and if the camera allows it listening to it. If the camera malfunctions midway through an interview or whatever you dont want to find out later when you actually start working on it. And having someone listening to the footage with good headphones like Sennheisers or Sony Professional not I must be good because Im expensive Beats theyre not nearly as expensive as you think they are pressed against their head will detect a lot of stuff you cant hear with your ears but microphones will pick up like a dangling cord hitting the tripod or some cat scratching something in the distance. That person should be willing to speak up if they hear something and unless its something that simply cannot be repeated e.g. someone breaks down weeping they should be willing to interrupt people ASAP.If you are using lavalier microphones AKA lapel mics have the subject run the cable up under their shirt or jacket. Try to avoid situations where the microphone might be hit or pick up extraneous noise. So watch out for necklaces or rubbing of fabric. Also make sure you test the audio because some lavaliers are directional and wont like being mounted sideways or whatever. This is why its important to have someone listening because you would never hear any of this with your ears alone. Also make sure youre listening for reverb. Hanging blankets on a wall is a quick trick to reduce reverb.If youre shooting in controlled circumstances like an interview unplug everything you can possibly unplug. Dont just turn off unplug. Theres a ton of stuff youd never imagine thatll make distracting and annoying sounds. A transformer in a TV set might kick off interference that only a mic can pick up. A refrigerator might turn on its compressor and kick out a loud humm. An HVAC vent might make a subtle rattling or an almost inaudible hiss. Also on this note everyone involved should sit down and be still. The mics can and will pick up people walking around or the shuffling of papers or all sorts of things like that.If you can control your environment you should be lighting it too. Theres a lot of stuff you can fix in the camera or in post but bad lighting is something you cant. Experiment with moving the lights closer to or further from your subjects to change how their skin looks in the light.That means unless its part of the look youre going for block off the windows so your shots dont randomly become brighter or darker because a cloud moved in front of the sun or whatever. Different lights have different colors so white balancing is critical.If you can borrow lights from your school do it. Try and see if you can get a softbox as part of your kit. Also make sure you get some diffusion for other lights. If your lights have barn doors those metal flaps you should experiment with them to control what things are and arent lit. If not see if you can borrow some black wrap also called Cinefoil to kind of DIY it. Having three lights is recommended for classic three point lighting though one of those lights in a three point light setup practically speaking can sometimes be a bounce board a big white silver or gold surface used to reflect some light you can DIY one with a big presentation board.If you cant borrow lights then use whatever youve got. You could try using an old wash rag or some other worn piece of cloth as diffusion to make shadows less harsh and then hit it with a bounce board to take a bit more of the edge off.Note lights also flicker at your utility frequency which is usually Hz in North America and Hz in Europe. Your shutter speed should be such that it doesnt interfere with that. Heres a writeup and calculator on how to prevent that flickerNow I know I said automatic controls are the devil but if youre doing runandgun shooting where stuff is changing by the minute if your camera has a fast autofocus system its not the worst thing ever to throw it into auto for a moment and then adjust it yourself from there. The DVX had a little button on the side just for that purpose.For camera mounting you should have a tripod and an monopod. If your tripod has a bubble level good ones should use it. Its better to adjust the tripod legs to even things out because its more stable that way and less prone to wobble. Try and avoid extending the center column the thing with the hand crank as that also will be prone to wobble. Unless youre doing camera moves you should lock off all controls on the tripod before shooting to avoid accidental movement.Monopods are excellent for providing additional stabilization when youre out and about and they take a lot of the weight and stress off your hands meaning youll get less tired and be more stable. Its also much faster to set up and easier to move around with than a tripod. You can use a tripod like a jib but note that this is often a major nono for borrowed equipment so make its OK and they wont take away your camera before you even think about trying it.Shooting techniqueAlways run the camera for longer than you think you need to. Its easier to just cut out the extraneous stuff than it is to work with not having enough footage. That means run the camera for a few seconds before you get your shot so you dont end up with things like a slight wobble from you pressing the button.You should also record room tone. Just roll the camera for about a minute to record the silence. Unless youre doing interviews in an anechoic chamber there will be some kind of background noise and this can be used to make edits where youve gapped out an interview answer less noticeable or to capture a noise print from if you need to do noise reduction.When interviewing people you the interviewer should pause before moving on to the next question. Let the person sit there for a second when done then move on. Unless the interviewer is going to be part of the documentary make sure you get the interview subject to make the question part of their answer. If the question is how did it feel to do THING? their answer should be something like when I did THING I felt And stop them before they get too far into the answer if they dont do it right.Unless youre shooting with a DSLR that has clip time limits do not pause the camera between questions. It might seem like a quick and easy way to sort stuff out but you might miss things like if they do a quick followup right after they finish a question.You need Broll. Not stock footage but actual Broll. If they talk about something or some place get footage of that. Maybe theyre in the shot maybe theyre not. If you cant actually go to a place referenced go to a place like it. If they talk about walking along the railroad tracks as a kid you can just use any old place where it looks like someone could walk along the tracks. Get Broll of your interview subjects too try to tie it into what theyre talking about.If you can squeeze in a second camera for your interviews maybe a cell phone on a minitripod or someones old camcorder or whatever then try it. You can always just ignore that footage. The second camera should look different from the first but not too different. Maybe they get closeup of the person gesticulating or its a closeup from a different angle instead of a wide shot.,VideoEditing,cx4sycy,2,t5_2ri0h

Bill them at the industry rate and then apply your discount as the situation warrants.This way they see your regular rates they perceive that theyre getting a deal and youre not locked in as the guy that does it for free. You dont get passed via referral as the free option  you get referred as this guy gave me a great RATE!  The initial conversation with the new client then becomes about cost  not doing it for free and you can adjust your discount with each referral as you build a portfolio.  You give less and less discount with each new client as you see fit.Youre also not going to dilute the waters of the people that have already gone through this phase and can now charge full price.  To often theyre met with but my buddy will do it for free  why wont you?

Then you would copy the layervideo and put it underneath the video with the mask to fill in that  pixel hole. The reason for this is that the pixel is always changing so by putting copying the video and putting it underneath and shifting it slightly the hole will be filled in with a correct or similar color pixel.

9536270,0,t1_d9oinwr,Biggest things are CPU processor Video Card and RAM memory.  I believe a MacBook Pro retina display should come with enough umph under the hood to handle this at a base level.  The only thing youd need would just be a hardrive to handle the actually footage itself.  My only additional note is that most monitorstvs at this point are still only HD.  That means most people who view your gorgeous k content are really only seeing it at normal HD rez.  Youd need to invest in a k monitortv to really get to experience the resolution.  I personally in my usage havent seen a need to drop that cash on a k monitor YET so I usually only shoot in p for my drone shots or during a film shoot.  This makes everything a bit easier to handle both in terms of editing and storage.

She tried using VLC and Windows movie Maker to rotate the video and save it but after rotating there are quite big black bars around the video.Is there an easy way to rotate a video without generating these black bars and can it be done with free to use software?Thanks a lot in advance!,VideoEditing,deapqw9,1,t5_2ri0h

Youd be happy to arrange the project file after their money clears. Wait for their money to clear.Im happy to arrange for the project now....And then charge them for it. Same deal.Above all else do not give them the project in exchange for the money.  They have shown they dont care. No work gets done until they settle up. If they want to employ you for changes then they pay in advance. If they want the project file then the pay in advance.,VideoEditing,debvmkz,13,t5_2ri0h

Then when its time to create the actual ad they start with that plan that took large amounts of time and money to create  hire the best creators and editors on the planet  and typically give them permission to deviate from all that work  if the artists involved see an improvement possible.

If the client doesnt know and unless theyre an agency they wont you can get the specs from the cable company running the spot. If you know the company you can google the specs yourself.
