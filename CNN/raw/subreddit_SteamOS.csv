161291,0,t3_1vww9y,I just got notified that Im in the beta Im very impressed. I can now log in from multiple machines without getting kickedobviously awesome change on its own. In the settings there is a new in home steaming tab. It lists all available logged in machines. The library is different now. There is a local games section for installed games. The old installed now lists all games installed anywhere on the network. I can either play locally stream as well as remotely install a game on the other machine.I tried super hexagon on my laptop for a difficult test. It launches the game on both machines simultaneously. You cant use the source machine for anything. There is a badass diagnostic UI that appears by pressing F it shows lag resolution frame rate. Everything you want. Especially a sweet graph. I have a  travel mini router. Its the size of a couple shot glasses. I expect it to perform very poorly in comparison. Its giving me ms average lag. Input lag of under ms.Hexagon is mostly unplayable but overall I am quite impressed. ,SteamOS,cewsyew,7,t5_2yl1g

637915,0,t1_cgcqc2h,SteamOS is a beta product thats absolutely true. I havent had a chance to use it and it interests me very much. My experiences only include Windows and the Big Picture interface on it.Many of these if not all of these problems are developer caused. Valve allows for third party stuff to be added to games that can compromise that controller experience and this stuff doesnt happen on my Xbox  PlayStation  Wii. If there was a PS game that didnt launch at all or needed you to plug a mouse  keyboard interface to troubleshoot it there would be hell to pay.I guess what Im looking for is the console experience with upgradeable hardware and a Valve storefront.

Theyre the games you have purchased.

5945659,0,t1_cxyv6io,I think that the difference was the OnHub router from Google. I was using an Asus router previously that I bought about five months ago and the streaming was finicky. I got rid of cable completely and use a digital antenna and stream TV to various devices around the house and it was buffering to the point that my wife wanted me to bring back cable. Well nobody wants to hear those words.The OnHub is crazy  it has  antennas in there and it connects to each device using the best frequency  no more trying to figure out which one to use at which location  or whether a device uses N or G or AC or whatever. Its like night and day  it felt like a light switch went off in the house and every corner of the house is now lit up with a solid five bar WiFi signal. The Steam Link is connecting at . and I guess that Google decided that the stronger signal on the top floor gives better performance than a faster weaker Ghz signal. On the main floor it looks like the devices that can connect at Ghz are connecting at   so the X is connecting at GHz on the main floor and streaming to the Link on the top floor that is connected at .GHz and both are connected to the same OnHub router.My cable connection that all of these devices are connected to has a max bandwidth of MBPS but it varies from between MBPS to about MBPS depending on the time of day  which I find odd. Theres a Google app for your phone that measures this kind of stuff so right now Im getting MBPS on the cable modem connection downstream MPBS upstream with  devices connected. Total downstream usage of all of the devices is .MBPS right now and so if I were to start a streaming session Ive got a whole heck of a lot of bandwidth to play with. Also  if theres a lot of users on at the same time  I can set a priority device using the same app to make sure that it gets the bandwidth that it needs. Get at OnHub. Thats the bottom line.,SteamOS,cxz0866,2,t5_2yl1g

6595766,0,t3_45wofy,I think what will inevitably happen is we will have the Windows Store become another storefront similar to Steam Uplay and Origin. Just another platform we have to worry about on Windows. Valve really needs to step up development on SteamOS if they want it to go anywhere. Im not talking about your every day bug fixes. Im talking major changes that can compete with the operating systems Sony and Microsoft have created for their consoles. These days people dont want a console that just plays games Nintendo is the exception to this rule it needs to be a HTPC as well. While this can be done it should be extremely simple for the user. SteamOS is already limiting to people that are used to having no limitations on Windows so SteamOS needs to be really compelling for them to switch. An example of this is Tesla with their cars. They brought a very compelling product to the market that didnt exist. However that wasnt enough it had to go above and beyond what the other manufacturers were doing and basically be flawless. This is where their service and the safety records come in. Because electric cars are new Tesla decided it would be worth their time and money in the long run to start building the infrastructure to charge them. Maybe not the best example in the world but hopefully it gets the idea across that Valve needs to go above and beyond to be successful with SteamOS.,SteamOS,d01k1i6,3,t5_2yl1g

This means that a driver written for multiple hardware configurations wont be any less efficient as far as execution goes just bigger for all of the permutations it has to contain. If it detects that its on hardware configuration X it only runs the code and includes the libraries optimized for configuration X. The code and libraries for configurations Y and Z are ignored as if they dont even exist. My understanding is that optimizing for a specific hardware platform would be better served coming from the game than the drivers.,SteamOS,d152nub,1,t5_2yl1g

Performance differences will be nonnoticeable or noticeable for some games i.e. those that are most optimized for steamos if any but not all. For me steamos seems to do a pretty good job filtering the store library so that only steamoslinux games are shown in general however there is a setting to prevent the filtering. Store ads do include Windows only games though.You may be interested in the article The Pros and Cons of SteamOS The article is old  however things might not have changed all that much.The Pros that still apply may include  Steamos is free  Some games might run better  More games for Linux usersCons that still apply may include  Steam machines dont compete in price  Cost of developingporting a game for steamos might increaseThe only other benefit I can think that might apply to steamos is any low latency tweaks Valve have done to the underlying inputoutput or other system for controllers or streaming via the steamlink. However I dont know if these tweaks are significant enough to justify building a steamos machine or purchasing a prebuilt steam machine. ,SteamOS,db0q216,3,t5_2yl1g
