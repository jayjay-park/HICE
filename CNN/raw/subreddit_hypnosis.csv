This third eye sits directly above the cerebellum which is responsible for motor control having the appearance of staring upwards away from the cerebellum. The ability to align your regular eyes to the same direction as this third eye could be considered a prerequisite for lowering your third eye to the same plane as your regular eyes.Heres a crudely illustrated diagram,hypnosis,chmnrhm,0,t5_2qjlg

Definitely worth a read from newer and probably some experienced tists.My only criticism is aesthetic that in trying to convince readers to shy away from the showy hypnotic jargon you are creating your own brand of showy nonhypnotic jargon  You seem to take highly from performers Darren Brown Anthony Jacquin etc who are in fact quite good at what they do but it creates the impression that this the way it is done.

3456068,0,t1_cpkvq91,Have you by chance read the tests they use for that scale?First they read a standardized eye closure induction to the subject.Then they administer a series of tests.The premise is that the tests test suggestibility but that is actually not currently scientifically possible. What they actually measure is the individual subjects ability to perform those specific tests namely hallucination  something that quite a lot of people cant successfully do even in very deep trance  age regression limb rigidity anosmia amnesia  which again quite a lot of people cant succeed at regardless of trance depth  and an instruction to the subject to dream then describe the dream.The quite predictable results are that most people are moderately susceptible to hypnosis  specifically  of people experience a moderate response to this series of tests. Only ten percent of the subjects respond well to all the tests which has nothing whatsoever to do with trance depth and everything to do with their ability to perform those specific tests.Thats the trick see.  of people responded to even that goofy laundry list of tests. That set of tests is  and I know this is gonna sound like crazy talk  stuff normal people cant do that well full stop. Thus a moderate response.Most people are unable even in hypnosis to turn off their sensory apparatus so completely that they cant tell when you shove a strongsmelling chemical under their nose and its foolish to think they could.Almost everyone can flex their muscles really really tightly awake or in trance.Most people cannot easily defy the direct evidence of their senses. Hallucination is a challenge simply because the evidence that it is untrue is right in front of you most people cant do it without more than a single session of practice... And yet most subjects can learn to do it if theyre given practice.The Stanford experiments and the tests that resulted do not take into account individual skill and ability on the part of either the hypnotist or subject they dont take into account the effect of practice they dont take into account the results of different inductions none of those factors are even considered.Every hypnotist who had ever worked with actual subjects knows that some subjects need different inductions. This is why professional hypnotists learn more than one induction subjects are individuals and any experiment that purports to make broad conclusions about hypnotic susceptibility in the general public must take that into account or it is utterly worthless.The tests and the data they present should be taken for exactly what they are unscientific poorly overgeneralized and extremely limited in utility.If you want to read the tests yourself you go right ahead.

Generally speaking something that seems to work for many people is listening before going to sleep or listening right after waking up... basically when the mind is almost halfasleep anyway and so it becomes easier to just go along with the recording.The most important thing is that you dont have anything else going on at the same time. While I cant say for certain that the recording will be completely ineffective if youre not actually paying attention youre probably not setting yourself up for success by doing it that way.

4532638,0,t1_cspk96k,The method I rely on is I put and generally stay in a relatively deep trance state and so anything I do or say is likely to put someone else there.You can see this with Erickson in his seminar Zeig where he points out to the audience they did not notice he was in a trance state. A bit absurd because much of what Erickson states about approaching trance states is all about creativity. He is operating automatically.In this way everything you do and say is at the very least suggestions to follow me.Say a trance state is metaphorically getting someone to go to Japan. And you go to Japan. Everything you are saying is to come over here. They can establish rapport with you and follow you. Or you can establish rapport with them. And they will go to where you are at. Or any mixture inbetween.Some writers are exceptional at putting themselves into deep trance states when writing their books. The details and characters just come alive from their pen. They do not know what they are writing really. It is from their unconscious. And when people read it they just know it is a page turner. Their unconscious loves it. It could be about cabbages or superheroes. It does not matter. Not to dismiss a collection of good inductions nor regular hypnoscripts! Because I believe most experienced hypnotists if not all their own selves go into trance states naturally. It is modified to some degrees so they may not even be aware of it. But are they really in focus? Is much of what they are doing automatic? Do their own words surprise them? Do they feel generally at some discernible distance from the external at least enough to feel separated from the worries amp desires of the world they see their patients are not?,hypnosis,ct1z1ly,2,t5_2qjlg

5788543,0,t1_cxem039,Thanks for the concern but Im not exactly here for selfhelp nor do I have issue with being plural. Frankly its a little presumptuous that you think people need to be singular entities to be healthy but as noted we are quite healthy and harmonious. I should also point out that I didnt suggest he take up chaos magick simply pointing out another abstract possibility and reminding him that a consciousness is just that.Further I refute the notion that its mumbo jumbo. Have you had any personal experience with it? It is certainly potentially dangerous but so is a gun and I still like to shoot skeet with friends. From the shallow use Ive had in the art there is some potential correlation between sigil work and things Ive tried to achieve with it. It crosses over somewhat with hypnosis as religions hypnotists and mages all rely on altered states of consciousness particularly a gnoctic state. The divergence comes in that hypnosis tends to deal with the individual while religion and magick deal with the collective too.And there most certainly is some level of collective consciousness there. Ive personally accidentally sent a complex thought wordlessly and verified it afterwards. I also suspect Ive experienced it at least twice more but circumstance prevented concrete verification.Is there a reason for you to be adverse to having a mind open enough to consider the ludicrous even as a thought experiment?,hypnosis,cxemg0t,4,t5_2qjlg

7864152,0,t1_d3nyr1l,Delta is associated with sleep according to the science behind brain waves. Alpha is associated with hypnosis. All the time. Delta is deep sleep. Never a hypnotic state. We have many users of the biofeedback machines for hypnosis where I live. Its very popular. Hypnosis is ALWAYS associated with alpha and theta waves.I would be willing to say your friend possibly doesnt understand the EEG machine. All brainwaves are being produced at once. They do fluctuate though. We read the fluctuation of the waves on the machine. They increase and decrease with different activity the brain may be involved.Alpha waves occur in high stress situations all the time. It is common knowledge that alpha waves do not require someone to be calm but are more easily created in a calm state. Breathing can induce alpha states. All athletes enter an alpha state when they are in the zone for example. This is highly studied and proven. ,hypnosis,d4003qw,1,t5_2qjlg

8466817,0,t3_4vnngb,Good question.I honestly believe hypnosis is a viable tool for dealing with stuff like eating problems or anxiety... on the other hand hypnosis is a tool and not a cure in itself. Typically you need a suitable therapeutic concept of sorts though you may be lucky enough to not need one in some cases plus some concepts are so ridiculously simple they hardly look like therapy. As in most professions many hypnotists arent actually very good at what they do Sturgeons law is often cited in contexts like this one and the ones who are probably dont have the time to work with all of their colleagues at least not to the detriment of other clients. Also surprisingly many people are too proud or too insecure to ask for help I used to have both of those problems myself.In addition to that before you start trying to change yourself for real you have to make a decision. If you dont perceive your habits as a problem and they have some kind of benefit for you youre not going to change them period. In overly simplified terms someone who enjoys eating more than they dislike being overweight might decide to stay overweight medical consequences be damned. Their choice!The one with the herbs is more interesting because getting rid of anxiety seems like a straightforward choice to make right? I suspect that in cases like that its a problem of perspective once again. Its really really hard to therapize I cant believe thats not a word yourself youre stuck in a mindset that perpetuates the problem otherwise youd have gotten rid of it already and you need to step out of that mindset to get away from that and by extension a hypnotist who doesnt have the right mindset to think outside of your problem may not be able to help much either. Some hypnotists especially the ones who believe that super simple direct suggestions can take care of anything under the sun which may even be true I dont know but even then many super simple direct suggestions are very likely to fail may conclude from their issues with solving their issues that their problem is so extra special that it defies even their own virtually unlimited magnificent hypnotic power. Given that why bother talking to a colleague?As for figuring out which professional hypnotists are worth your money... sorry I dont have straightforward check list or anything like that. I understand your hesitation personally I wouldnt want to work with quite a few of the hypnotists Ive come across but some of them are pretty darn amazing. If all else fails an interesting option is getting into hypnosis yourself.By the way if youd like to get a more or less balanced view on whatever you want to work on and how hypnosis might or might not factor into it feel free to send me a message. I understand if you dont want to discuss it with strangers on the internet though. ,hypnosis,d5zw2a0,1,t5_2qjlg

Often it is friendly rapport but two people fighting with each other are also in some kind of rapport you can use.Further please consider that their desires need not be their weaknesses.
