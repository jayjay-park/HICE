604279,0,t3_20u8g9,That was the point which destroyed the suspension of disbelief I had for Colbert. The writers obviously knew that Red Eye is a comedy show and the writers also assume that its viewers do not watch Fox News at all so its a terribly dishonest move on their part.,RedEye,cg8ykic,4,t5_2s8bi
719975,0,t1_cgk449e,I agree with this. I think they put Joanne on to attract the younger demo but she wasnt really the best choice for the long haul. Greg often has to brush past awkward things she says when she tries to be funny. Its uncomfortable to me.,RedEye,cgm44rs,1,t5_2s8bi
903342,0,t1_ch6xv0g,Ive seen JoNo as a panelist I guess she will get better with time Andy seems alright as a panelist the guests were getting to be the same people every week and the discussions were getting stale. Not as many crazy theories from greg and everyone seemed to be holding back,RedEye,ch6yr8y,2,t5_2s8bi

4355445,0,t1_csgkw7a,I agree.  I hope they change back.  I also dont see Gregs new show lasting too long.  I thought he wouldve gotten a new show that was sort of like OReilly but this is too weird.  I know its still early but I cant even finish the entire show before I get bored and turn it off.  ,RedEye,csglb0b,6,t5_2s8bi
