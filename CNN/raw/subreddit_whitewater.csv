2311791,0,t1_clx41qd,The logic behind releasing at the hip includesPast that point the power face starts to point upward and thus energy is being expended in pushing the bow down rather than forward lost effort. Also past the hip you begin pushing vs. pulling the boat and it tends to impart turning vs. forward. Rather than doing any of that start a new stroke on the opposite side and stay in the forward power zone. Youll find you can get a lot more done with a Fwd stroke.,whitewater,clxgbdc,1,t5_2rok8

3506833,0,t3_30ee33,Of the three sweep. Unless you find yourself upside down on the back deck its a dangerous roll and yes it can be done without the momentum starting right side up. The c yo c is alright but carries a much higher risk of shoulder injury and is much more susceptible to failure from aeration or funky hydraulics. Theyre all good to learn though just learning what motions can get you up is super useful. The ideal would be to get comfortable enough that you can roll from any body or paddle position. To that end Id also recommend learning the reverse screw roll thats a motion which can be initiated from common positions to flip in and also try to end your sweep rolls on the front deck like a storm roll. Basically you do a normal sweep roll halfway then reverse directions and push forwards. Last thing to keep in mind is staying inside the box and using your core not only for the hip snap but also for the forwardbackward motion. I can roll in a pool with almost no arm movement which is nice for my injured shoulder. ,whitewater,cps05gg,2,t5_2rok8

Most modern safety courses strongly advise against them.For rescue vests I suggest looking at the Nookie Rivermonster XT what I use or the Palm Equipment range personal recommendation the FXr but any that suits your preference.

With a boat like that they may end up moving into bigger and harder rivers without the correct whitewater skills and thats where itll come back to bite them.,whitewater,cskec1c,3,t5_2rok8

You might take a look at your outfitting to help you set up a little more easily. If your legs are really straight you may not quite have the flexibility to set up properly sitting with your legs wider is generally easier for most folks.Another thing to consider is how you grip the paddle to reach your blade to the surface.

8963090,0,t1_d7p7qj5,I still havent run the pattack its been on my list for years but nobody else seems interested. The allt a choarain would have been a pretty interesting level would it not given the amount of rain we have had. Its a completely different beast with some water compared to what you see in most videos. A totally mental run either way. What level was the leny?  Its my local run so Im on it most weeks What did you think of it?  And did you run the fallsleft or right ? ,whitewater,d7p88j6,1,t5_2rok8
9032632,0,t1_d7xajtp,Go out to that small stuff and work it hard. That is how you get good. You dont become a Class V boater by jumping on Class V you get there by learning and practicing over and over all of the hard moves on easy whitewater until you never mess them up because you cant afford to mess up much on Class IVV whitewater.,whitewater,d7xkv8i,3,t5_2rok8

9402005,0,t1_d97qupo,Thank you! Im  and  ish possibly pushing . I know that as I learn white water more that I will definitely be a more aggressive paddler.  I have heard that everyone sizes up and i wanted to know what the benefit is to having a bigger boat besides the obvious carrying capacity and resurface ability. The advice that I got from my group was that if I jumped into the T on my third river trip in my life that I would be tackling harder stuff in the future and should jump straight to a creeker. Do you think this is sound advice?,whitewater,d97rqyv,1,t5_2rok8
9662622,0,t1_da440ls,gt Again IR is not the only whitewater specific gear company but they are the biggest one.Name another.gt You can go on being dissatisfied that there arent more people boating or that your boating gear isnt as technologically advanced as it could be Im going to continue enjoying my time on the river. Fortunately I can still enjoy the river while also wanting and actively contributing to make things around me better at the same time. They arent mutually exclusive.,whitewater,da44cia,1,t5_2rok8
9671729,0,t3_5dblcf,Buying a vehicle can be a process. Basically to get a RUT number you have to find a chilean sponsor who will vouch for you. they more or less take responsibility for you if you bail on buying something. doing all the paperwork in  days would be a maircle. I would say its more like a week  time. Also going to need an address to send the documents to... A rental will run you about  a month. Also may depend on how many are in your crew if it is worthwhile to rent or buy. Vehicle are a bit expensive in Chile for their age and condition. check out yapo.cl or chileautos.cl for an idea of prices. Anyway good luck and maybe see ya on the river. Leaving monday for Chile as well,whitewater,da58rst,1,t5_2rok8

It will get the job done and will allow you to dabble up into the s.Honestly by the time you are running s you will know enough if this is the boat for you.If the outfitting is in good shape and the hull bottom is only scratched not cracked go for it.  Get kayaking!,whitewater,dd8i1r6,1,t5_2rok8

11006822,0,t1_defkiaa,i dont. your crew should know eachother and what skills you each have as well as your weaknesses. especially as you start stepping up the danger of your rivers communicating these things and knowing your crew well and working as one unit is extremely important.  As much as paddling is a solo effort it is also very much a team one.long story short you should be setting your own expectations not your gear.,whitewater,deflc63,3,t5_2rok8

11489126,0,t3_63tvhw,Have you considered an inflatable kayak? Theyre specifically designed for river running and can hold quite literally a ton of gear depending on what type you get.I own several Aire Tributary Strike  person kayaks when configured for a single person hold lots of gear still track decently on flat water and are good for class III stuff. Here is a video of a three day float we did down a remote river in Oregon. An Aire Tributary  person btw costs around  brand new you could find one used for less.The tomcat series is less expensive but more suited to bigger rapids but less so for flat water.You of course can get the single person version of either of these it will cost less money be more maneuverable but hold less gear. If you get an IK make sure to get leg straps as well theyre pretty much required for any large white water.,whitewater,dfyahlf,2,t5_2rok8
