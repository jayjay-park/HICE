When I was  I saw a live acoustic performance of Living Room on a related video on youtube and I was like Ill give this a shot again I guess.Fucking loved it. It was my favourite song immediately so I had to listen to more. The Ocean was next then Call it Off and then I was obsessed.And Im from the US!,teganandsara,dftodoy,1,t5_2rmyz
