As he put the tape in there it showed an atari style minigame again this time it seemed to be the animatronics following some kind of shadow freddy and after they stopped following them the same purple men from before would come and dismantle them but after the fourth animatronic got teared apart it wasnt an animatronic that appeared next it seemed to be the sprite of a crying child after he went to the same room that the animatronics were dismantled he scared the same purple man into an springbonnie suit which ended up crushing him.  Fredhybrid well that was something....?,roleplaysfamilydiner,cubxboh,1,t5_39n6s
4898968,0,t1_cuc1uda,The Devil Well you ran out of charge. But it seems like youre programmed in a way that your system charges itself without any help. Thats good thats useful. But...your eyes blackened out. If I were a human Id consider it creepy.,roleplaysfamilydiner,cuc1xyg,1,t5_39n6s
4967632,0,t1_cukpcx2,Yes. I havent listened to any others though. There were a lot of documents in the system too. Stuff about the vents and details about us. I got some passwords too. There were a few things that were so well protected that I couldnt get into them but the codes were easy to find.Saber walked over to the terminal stepping over the night guard and started to boot up the old terminal.Im going to have to use this beast. The data wont appear on the tablets.,roleplaysfamilydiner,cukphe4,1,t5_39n6s
5041315,0,t1_cutni68,Tobias nodded and turned to face Stanley.Stanley was frozen to the spot as he saw the two animatronics standing before him. Then Tobias leaped in front of him and he returned to his senses.AAAAARGH! he yelled as he dodged Tobias. He ran to the back of the room but Perry was ready for him and blocked his path. Stanley did a swift Uturn and headed towards a doorway as fast as he could. Arrrrr! growled Tobias grabbing Stanley by the back of his shirt and shaking him. Stanley flailed around helplessly for a few seconds before he was allowed to fall to the ground. He got to his feet and started running again.This is crazy!!!!! Carrie a little help?! he called out behind him.,roleplaysfamilydiner,cuto46g,1,t5_39n6s
