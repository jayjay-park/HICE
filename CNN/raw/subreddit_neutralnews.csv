While I agree theres a pattern of that I both intentionally try to avoid it and dont feel it applies here.I dont see a solution because I dont see a solution.  I dont feel doing just anything for the sake of feeling like I at least tried is a solution.  If I were to see a solution which had some possibility of actually helping the situation I would support it.  And I do.  For example I am a firm supporter in the idea that we need to vastly increase sales and tracking data on weapons as that would help the police greatly.But honestly the vast majority of solution that I see dont even involve guns. Thats treating a symptom.  Personally I would love to see money and focus poured into the communities where gang violence is such a problem which accounts for much of gun violence and a host of other problems.  And while that would in my view anyway greatly help with bringing down the overall numbers of gun violence it would not have any effect on these individual cases.  The assassination attempts the murder of famous people those are artifacts of our culture as a whole and those are the ones I dont see a solution for.More to the point I see a partial solution but its not possible... calm moderation from most people.  Not surrounding ourselves in accelerating Echo Chambers such as TD or SP.  Not having everything needing to be the most extreme outrageous or incisive.  A calmer culture ranging from the way people behave on TV to the way that people are expected to act and YouTube comments.However that ship has sailed and shifts to cultural tone arent something you can plan for beyond just trying to be calmer yourself.  Trying to be less susceptible to clickbait being put off by people who are trying to make you angry instead of letting them and not actively seeking out things to keep yourself outraged.shrugIm not defeated or cynical I simply do not see a realistic solution to individual cases like this.

9721281,0,t1_dabalvx,Two good options I think would be mathematically drawn districts or proportional representation. Explanations are very simplified because I only kind of know what Im talking about.Math districts basically involves bisecting a larger region say a state X number of times into roughly equal districts. This could be tempered to split based on equal population equal area in a way that strongly encourages competition between parties or a combination. This is good for keeping representatives locally based but is largely only a two party solution and can result in weird districts.Personally I favor proportional representation. In this say you have  possible seats for the whole state. If  of people vote Democrats  Republican and  Libertarian you get  Democrats  Republicans and  Libertarian.

11293867,0,t3_6150jb,People say that but do they recognize that defense spending is the only socialized jobs program in the US? Would they support that spending in a more Keynesian jobs programs? If not then will they accept the massive amounts of layoffs that will occur without this type of economic support of vast swaths of this country?Personally I would love if we could expand the ASVAB military entrance test to include the entire Federal Government to become the FSVAB. Then focus spending on improving the country through training and jobs programs that are more broad based to help all Americans. We will need to maintain a socialized jobs program might as well make it less focused on killing people.  EditThe Department of Defense is the largest employer in the world It currently employs between . million people and . million depending on what is included. When you look at the next largest employers that are active in the USA they are unskilled workers at McDonalds and Walmart. This means that for unskilled citizens the largest opportunity that they have is the US Military and not a private entity. The costs of the US military are borne by US taxpayers which makes this a social program as well as a defense program. As for the layoffs I would simply expand from the economic impacts of US military expenditures by state and then with base closures where those monies were lost. ,neutralnews,dfc56l8,14,t5_2ql83

11386151,0,t1_dfmkuu2,The whole system of government in the US is designed towards checks and balances not just between branches but within them as well. It prevents any huge swings in governance that might result from shifting political tides. The system prioritizes stability over progress. On specific issues this leads to a lot of deliberation and in some cases obstruction but many people consider that a feature not a bug. The determination of whether any blocking tactic is good or useful depends on whether you buy into that paradigm.,neutralnews,dfmln52,3,t5_2ql83

11532467,0,t1_dg2rn0h,If you are in repayment while paying  it still counts towards loan forgiveness after  or  years duration depending on when the loan was taken out  years if in a public service occupation. So if you paid  over  years your loan would be forgiven at that point. If you are in forbearance status as opposed to repayment status those years arent credited towards loan forgiveness so after  years you would have made no progress towards loan forgiveness. Additionally for the first three years in income based repayment the federal government pays your interest if your payments arent high enough to cover it andI believe interest is not capitalized. In forbearance your interest is capitalized meaning that you then pay interest on the capitalized interest instead of just the principal. There are a lot of advantages to being on income based repayment even if the amount you are paying stays tyre same.Source borrowed to put myself through law school,neutralnews,dg37h0n,3,t5_2ql83
