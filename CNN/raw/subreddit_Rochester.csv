37648,0,t3_1uidgv,gt I once heard that some of the fenced in grassy areas owned by Kodak are too contaminated for humans to mow so they let goats out at night to eat the grass.If they were too contaminated for humans how would they get to the goats to come back? Wouldnt someone need to be wandering around on the grass in order to round back up the goats? And wouldnt something bad happen to the goats? ie whatever bad things that were expected to happen to the humans if they mowed said grass.Not saying the story isnt true its just that the reasoning doesnt make sense.,Rochester,ceipu7u,1,t5_2qhkc

Put enough down to not pay PMI it is a waste of money.Pay off your mortgage as fast as you can unless you have the motivation to leverage the cash instead and buy another property or investment.

1816480,0,t3_2fd3ay,I was thinking of making a post here myself this morning while driving to work that construction has been going on all summer and is moving at a incredibly slow pace. I feel like when they redid East Ave it took them no time whatsoever to wrap the whole thing up why is it taking them months for Monroe Ave? And what was the point of ripping up one entire side of the street just to only half refill it so it literally feels like youre driving down a dirt road now? Theyre doing all that work and shutting down parts of the street at a time but it looks like they have no intention of just fully repaving which Monroe has needed for a while anyway. And its not like Monroe is a lightly used street just seems like they dont care about the disruption at all. Monday night I was driving towards the city down by Union and one of those big plates they have covering the holes they left in the road had completely fallen in leaving a huge gap in the pavement they put up a cone to divert traffic making you driving into the oncoming lane. I also like how it looks like they decided to just drop a bunch of asphalt on the corner of MonroeOxford next to the church there instead of actually replacing all the sidewalk they ripped up. The whole thing seems fucking ridiculous.,Rochester,ck82hm4,6,t5_2qhkc

A lot of homes around MonroeParkSouth WedgeSwillburg dont have them so it isnt an item that is easily stored or secured.  In the part of Rochester I live in nearly every home has a garage or carriage barn.  Id say  of my neighbors have snowblowers  have a plow service and  shovel myself included.  I only shovel because I just bought this place and Im house poor for the time being.Due to my location the city tends to plow my street and sidewalk last the closer I get to work the cleaner the streets get.  I dont really complain about it too much because I dont have any trouble getting around with my snow tires mounted.  Its inconvenient at times but not impossible.  To be honest the thing that really bothers me are drivers who dont brush off their cars or make sure they have adequate tires for winter driving.

It used to house the personal library but now its a residential home. I wish I could remember the specifics of who it originally belonged to. William Kimball was a fascinating guy! Kimball Tobacco was at one point one of the largest cigarette producers in the country. Another fun history fact Americans mostly smoked pipes up until British soldiers picked up cigarette smoking from Turkish and Russian soldiers during the Crimean War . The habit quickly spread to Americans and Kimball got in very much at the ground floor of the popularity of cigarettes as his first factory opened in  and expanded in . In addition to his inventions he was also a pioneer of cigarette marketing and was one of the largest employers of women in an era before women really entered the work force in large quantities. This RHJ article on Kimball is a great read! Frenchs Mustard started in Rochester Fairport actually. This is why we have a Mustard St near the bus depot on E Main. Interestingly RT Frenchs mustard is what earned Rochester one line in the original The Anarchist Cookbook in the section on free entertainment... if I recall correctly back in  if you sent a letter to Frenchs they would send you a video or info packet or something. Whatever it was William Powell apparently got a kick out of it and mentioned it in the section on entertainment for the young impressionable anarchist. The Pinnacle Range has a fascinating history as part of Highland Park a mining operation and an old Indian trail system but one of its most unusual chapters was as a POW camp for Italian and later German soldiers during World War II. The German POWs became an attraction for the locals thanks to their beautiful singing which could be heard through the fences a fact which the American soldiers didnt appreciate. About  civilians were gathering by the camp every night to listen to the Germans sing and during summer of  tensions reached crisis level when American soldiers began fist fighting with civilians over their presence and the police were summoned to restore order. The soldiers eventually solved the problem by revving the engines of their vehicles while the Germans sang and eventually people stopped coming.Edit Maybe Im mistaken about  Prince Street... two rescued libraries on one block of Prince Street seems like too big a coincidence.

At this time the remains of approximately  people were discovered.  In April  while researching the history of the poor house and the asylum I came across the Chaplains Report from  which stated that the unmarked cemetery familiarly known as the bone yard was an enclosed lot of the public farm in the rear of the penitentiary.  This cemetery was located behind the old Penitentiary and was used to bury the inmates of the Penitentiary Alms House and Insane Asylum from  until January   when the County Board of Supervisors directed the Superintendents of the Penitentiary and of the County Poor to discontinue the burial of paupers or criminals in the old burying ground attached to the penitentiary and to have the remains of all such interred in Mount Hope cemetery.  The county board of supervisors of  were well aware that this cemetery existed but apparently it was never recorded. Perhaps the document concerning this cemetery hasnt been discovered yet.

4755491,0,t1_cttwn6t,That works well and good when were not all constantly participating in a complex society we arent ABLE to separate your decisions from others.Lets look at your line of reasoning  A business owner has the right to pay whatever they want and if thats not enough then he gets no employees and is out of business.  Ok sounds like a fair and self regulating system.  Unfortunately reality is much different.See hes the only business in town and has conspired with the businesses in other towns to all pay low wages.  Without options the workers are forced to work for whatever the employer feels like paying.This is where we are today  certain industries only pay minimum wage because thats the lowest we can go and business have conspired to keep it that way.  It doesnt stop at lowwage workers either.  Middle class wages have only risen about  on average since the s FAR less than inflation and FAR FAR less than executive compensation those who own the work we do.Your definition of Freedom assumes that everyone feels the way you do  that my freedom is as valuable as yours.  Unfortunately that doesnt always work so people have turned to their government to shift the balance.Look we could wax intellectual all day about this but it may just be better to look at the facts  countries with laissez faire labor regulations have a low standard of living China Korea India etc..  Countries with strict labor laws and a liveable minimum wage like Denmark Sweden Germany etc. have high standards of living and are leaders in public health and education.  There the people have the FREEDOM to pursue enriching careers because they know that everyone is forced to agree to your line of thinking  that good will begets good will.Capitalism has been cruising along unabated in this country for decades and things are pretty shitty for a lot of people.  I grew up in Rochester and visit as rarely as I can because its depressing seeing all of my hardworking collegeeducated buddies work two jobs for low pay because of the market.Look at the statistics  what youre advocating for is and has been in place since the s and the result is the poorest MIDDLE CLASS this country has seen since before the Great Depression a time when a lot of proworker labor laws were first being passed.,Rochester,cttz42s,3,t5_2qhkc

There are so many hidden costs that come with home ownership that people dont take into consideration before sinking themselves into a mortgage. House value doesnt appreciate unless you completely renovatefix up and eventually find the right buyer willing to pay full value for it. Then add in the New York taxes and your checking account is shot. I wouldnt even begin to think about buying a house unless I alone make k a year.

Which of course also makes them expensive to the consumer and as long as people are willing to pay a premium on them we definitely are they will continue to make and sell them.

7708784,0,t1_d3i93v5,Courtesy of usgtcoolguyELI version long! Cheryl Dinolfo was County Clerk. She won County Executive so she left the old position vacant. Since Cuomo is governor he gets to fill it. He filled it with a local Democrat Irondequoit Town Supervisior Adam Bello. Because Democrats fill with Democrats duhRepublicans are mad because theyve used County Clerk as stepping stone to win County Executive since Maggie Brooks or maybe even longer?. So local GOP chairman Bill Reilich went off saying Adam Bello was a bad supervisor and that a local project in Irondequoit ISquare was a failure and in default and thus why hed be a horrible County Clerk so vote for our GOP candidate when we find one. Everyone was surprised because thered been no public announcement of any default and the project looks successful.Then magically COMIDA a local agency that gives tax money for projects and had done so for ISquare issued a press release finding a condition of default on a Sunday no less!  they had built a small recycling center as their nd building when the original plans said theyd have a second retail building. But no one had told the developers the Nolans about the issue and it hadnt been made public so how did Reilich know?Thats the big question. Cue the silence from the County Executive for a couple days. The answer that Dinolfo gave was that her deputy Count Exec. and local party helper Justin Roj told Reilich because hes the liason to COMDA and knows the latest. But it looks very much like perhaps he didnt just have privileged knowledge that he shared with his party chairman for political gainattacks bad but that they effectively called up COMIDAs lawyers and told them to find a reason for default to make the accusations true possibly criminal. Roj fell on the sword and resigned.Ugly but most of us thought that was it. Then just recently we found out that a COMIDA board member just hired Roj. Looks and smells very much like the loyal party man fell on the sword to save DinolfoReilich and then got paid back with a fallback job. Read up on Maggie Brooks and MCWA for copious examples of local GOPs handing out cushy jobs to cronies.COMIDA was supposed to be investigated and there were calls before for the DA also GOP and buddybuddy with DinolfoReilich but going through significant personal health issues to look into this. No one is doing anything. Except the COMIDA board members who by my eyesight all appear to be the Democrat members by the way. Theyre all resigning to distance themselves from the stench. Except what actually is happening is that now Dinolfo and another local GOP member Anthony Daniele can stock the COMIDA board with  GOP cronies. ,Rochester,d3ifqzm,12,t5_2qhkc

8236599,0,t1_d573hbj,Heres a revelation  not resisting arrest can still get you killed. Case in point Philando Castile. He was shot several times while still seated in his car reaching for his wallet. Have you ever had a gun pointed at you or had someone grab you violently? Adrenaline kicks in and your body goes in fightorflight mode. This is the universal response to an imminent threat. If youve seen many from your community harrassed by racist cops and killed wouldnt you feel afraid and wonder if this cop is one of them? White people dont have the same fear and distrust towards police because theyve never experienced the treatment many black people have gotten for so long. It is very easy for white people to make the assumption that not resisting is that simple. Theres also the problem of trusting the court to be fair and give you the benefit of the doubt when so many innocent black people have been incarcerated.Yes BLM did indeed condemn the violence in Dallas. The biggest impact of BLM thus far is that it has brought the racists out of the woodwork just when everyone thought racism no longer existed. We are seeing the true colors of so many people and further validating the claim that racism continues to exist today but was just invisible to most  until now. There are now  groups affiliated with the KKK up  since . There are many more unaffiliated or unrecognized groups.Heres another revelation  Im white. Having grown up in a predominately black neighborhood and lived in a predominately black neighborhood throughout college Ive witnessed so many events that have opened my eyes to what we as white people do not normally see. Ive seen myself be treated differently than my black friend when my houses silent alarm was accidentally set off. Ive seen yearold black children be forcibly pushed against the wall and patted down. What was more shocking was the mix of fear and emptiness in their eyes that indicated that this was a frequent occurrence.Wake up. Look around you. Stop ignoring the problem. Instead try to take the time to educate yourself about the issues at hand and talk to the people involved and listen to their stories. Instead of resisting and ignoring their concerns work with them towards a solution where we can love and respect one another.,Rochester,d574pbj,4,t5_2qhkc

They shouldnt be protesting if theyre going to do it for a bullshit cause in an ineffective manner with no hope of having any impact while also disrupting people. They dont actually care about justice they just get off on disrupting people and being self righteous. If they truly wanted to effect change they would write petitions write to their representatives and take part in social justice committees that actually try to make specific practical real world changes rather than just bitching and disrupting people. Protests are fine and occasionally cause real change if you have a very specific demand like changing a specific law. Movements such as BLM and Occupy do not have specific demands.

Your logic would say that such observations should be tossed aside until a proper study is done where as mine accepts reasonable observations.

Observation is often what starts the scientific process its as if you want us to live in a vacuum where nothing is true unless its been tested and thats just not reality.

10214530,0,t1_dc1h1xy,The reason this program exists is the relation between the cost of generating  kWh and the current demand on the electrical grid in kW isnt linear. As demand rises the grid needs to start bringing peak load generation plants online. Some of these plants run for lt hours per year. But idling isnt free so the cost of generating power there can be a hundred times more expensive than a baseload generation plant that runs .To recoup that cost commercial customers often have a demand charge   peak rate of electrical usage in kW that they pay in addition to consumption charges .  total kWh consumed and often time there is a month ratchet so that charge will stay on their bill for  months.

So it isnt completely the same but basically demonstrated that the feds have threatened withholding funds to get what they want in the past.Thats what I thought. The big difference was that was arguably even more coercive in that it wasnt a question of following existing federal law. Instead the feds were using the power of funding to actively set local legislation because the Feds didnt have the power to actually make the law in this case.It serves as a classic example of the conflict between state rights and federal powers.,Rochester,de2jqc2,2,t5_2qhkc
