373182,0,t1_cfiu0ai,Actually sake doesnt have to meet the same requirements as wine. Wine has a higher standard due to its role in religious traditions. In fact sake is inherently kosher. The reason for certification has more to do with the making sure that there is no crosscontamination with any other products that may be nonkosher made at the facility. There are also different levels of kosher with the certification industry though. Some might require stricter standards involving the rabbi being a part of steamingcooking the rice but most basic kosher certification just worries about crosscontamination and that you are using the ingredients you say you are using. ,Sake,cfjg1pr,1,t5_2r60o

If thats the case then it was almost certainly pasteurized and will be fine. Either way as SendLawyers said it would just taste gross and wouldnt make you sick.,Sake,de8fwe7,4,t5_2r60o

11533417,0,t1_dg3616k,Thanks a bunch.  I bought these  years ago.  The rikishi is probably bad as the seal is broken I had some a long time ago but there is hope for gekkeikan! I got sold on it as the guy at duty free said it was the last one in stock making it the Last Samurai.  Im pretty sure that joke got dropped on me a half dozen times over the trip so it was fitting it gets used again on the way out.  Im sure once I left another samurai appeared but worth it. ,Sake,dg3bcnf,1,t5_2r60o
