5011279,0,t1_cupuky9,Andreas grabbed a chair at the end of the food court a small bag of Gunpla and modeling supplies with him as he began to hum a tune he knew while he set out the Runners and his tools. The Templar Nimbus was proving to be a frustrating mess to keep in working order with all of its weaponry and all the extra parts hed attached. It was time for something new something that went back to his roots and his code of honor as a Knight of Ireland. Fortunate for him he was in Japan where Gunpla kits were everywhere and his selection was vast. A smile creased his face as he looked at the base of his new kit an HGUC Victory  Gundam.  Andreas set about the basic construction sipping on a bottle of water as he worked. ,SarraMinovskyNotes,cuq1rlt,1,t5_34isf
5017091,0,t3_3jgfpt,Johann glanced over at the battle system as the fight concluded. Hes decent. I wonder what the special system it was using is it seems similar to the Efreet Nachts cold weapons. He stood up from the tables that surrounded the arena. The waiting battlers and other guests were sitting around watching the battle unfold on the large screen above them. Fira sat across from him sipping a drink as she saw the battle unfold. I guess you knew who was going to win from the beginning.Of course.So whatd you think?Well his suit is powerful but his technique is sloppy. Hes a better builder than he is a fighter.Youre probably right.,SarraMinovskyNotes,cuqr0a8,1,t5_34isf

5174614,0,t1_cv9ptgk,Fang regains his grounds as he looks over at the Sinanju once again he switches over to his special  Frozen Fists as the Dread Ice purges the arm guns as his fists begin to turn an icy blue a misty aura begins to form around them as Fangs eye begins to glow. Looks like this is my last chance to do something LETS FUCKING DO THIS!   He charges in fast towards the Sinanju punching it straight in the face causing part of it to shatter as the Sinanju takes another blow straight to the side of the stomach.,SarraMinovskyNotes,cv9qbwg,1,t5_34isf
