6331247,0,t1_cz8taz8, Ignore the ignorant island bumpkins who think they are GodsAllahs unique gifts to the world despite pretending to be the biggest progressives in the world. In general there are two types of young Greeks the spoiled shits who never have had to work extending even to household chores and those who are deprived of opportunities either they are unemployedand their parents also lack money maybe they are simple herdersfarmers or maybe they work ridiculous hours for shit pay. There is not much between those two extremes. If you are used to living in certain countriesthe USA UK Western Europe you dont want to know planet spoiled and the other group is resigned to their fates and reeks of defeatism. For some reason the Greek world has a shitty superiority complex against their diaspora. Which contrasts greatly with how Israel treats and utilizes their diaspora    Israel turns a Jewish diaspora that often has no relation or relatives in the state of Israel into an asset for diplomacy international relations intelligence gathering tourism economic relations investment military recruitment. While mainland Greeks and Greek Cypriots who try to invest move to or deal with their once fatherlands just leave with a nasty taste in the mouth.

10738889,0,t1_ddnl6u4,gtTraditionally Turkish CypriotGreek Cypriot ratio is also  so I cant see anything weird there. I also cant see anything so abnormal we demanding so checks and balances or quotas given the history.I try to remain as fair and objective as I can and not allow emotions to take the better of me in these kind of discussions but I would like to point out some positions that the TC side presents in the negotiations that I and I believe many other Greek Cypriots find unfair. Demand for the right to militarily intervene given to Turkey. This would make sense if the GC side insisted on giving Greece the right to militarily intervene. But the GC side has consistently been saying that no country should have this right. Demand for foreign troops on the island to give a sense of security. I cannot see how this will work. Turkish troops will not a stop a right wing fanatic from damaging the car of a Turkish Cypriot. Only the police can do that. The presence of the Turkish military will only serve to add more fuel to the right wing nationalist fire while making the rest of the population who want to have good relations with the Turkish Cypriots feel uneasy. Demand for all settlers to remain. Anastasiades has even agreed to this hugely unpopular. The sentimental bond thing with regards to property. The TC claim that Greek Cypriots who were younger than  years old in  did not develop enough of a sentimental bond with their property and thus should not have priority over the current user of their property. Four freedoms of the EU  to apply to Turkish citizens. This was first presented by Turkish officials but now Akinci is setting it on the table. As a result barely any progress was made in the last two meetings with Anastasiades. I really dont get how this position is in the interest of the TC side.I feel very strongly against all of these positions. I am very much for a solution I was hopeful when Akinci was elected but over time I become more and more pessimistic when I see the positions of the TC side. It is now a mere certainty that at least one and most probably more than one of these points will be part of the solution if we ever reach one and that will make it very difficult for me to vote .I hope I do not come off as aggressive or anything. It is not my intention. I merely try to understand the TC positions and hope that could get the opinion of someone from the other side.,cyprus,ddnmvua,5,t5_2qyof
