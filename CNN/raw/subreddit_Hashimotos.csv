10131672,0,t3_5jz7yz,Im also new to diagnosis three weeks into NatureThroid over a month of gluten free if you dont count the accidental run ins with goddamn delicious soy sauce in goddamn delicious Vietnamese food and I personally havent gotten significantly increased energy or increased sensitivity to caffeine. I occasionally feel a little more energy in the evenings after work.. like you know I can actually cook dinner and eat it and NOT fall asleep directly after?
