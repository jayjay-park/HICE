8941826,0,t3_51ylxm,The best answer is its complicated and depending on the US company they will not allow it.  I know we just fired two remote employees in a group next to time because they were Mexican employees and moved to the US as telecommute workers.  Whats even weirder for our situation is that we MOVED their spouses to the US.,movingtojapan,d7moc6t,1,t5_3fy6c
8951561,0,t3_52vclp,I unfortunately dont have any direct experience with shipping that much stuff. A quick googling will find you several shipping companies that will happily take your money although Im sure you already know that.The one piece of knowledge I can give is that you will need to fill out the Unaccompanied Baggage Customs Form However my guess would be that whatever shipping company you work with will walk you through the procedure.,movingtojapan,d7nuen3,2,t5_3fy6c
9105827,0,t1_d86crxi,Posting sarcastic replies in every thread in this subreddit will kill this subreddit doing it in rjapanlife wont because its driven by other content.gtSometimes people need a sarcastic kick up the ass to realise that they are out of touch with reality.If you mock someone the chances of them seriously engaging with what you say drops dramatically. You could have said everything you said in your original comment in a blunt and severe way and not come across as mocking.,movingtojapan,d86dhhk,1,t5_3fy6c
9404393,0,t3_59eth1,Both the Tokyo and the Osaka metropolitan areas are huge cosmopolitan cities with people from all over the world. Outside of these areas you are likely to meet Russian students at universities Japanese language schools and what not. As for Russian speaking Japanese people Russian is not a main language that is studied in Japan but there are people who study it. Im confident that you could find Russian speaking friends in all but the most rural of places.Something else to consider is that Vladivostok was made a visa free zone this year so getting there is now relatively cheap and easy. You certainly could plan on making a few trips over there while in Japan. Certainly long weekends and holidays but it is close enough only two hours on the direct flight from Tokyo that you could go for a weekend.,movingtojapan,d982ngj,1,t5_3fy6c

10052883,0,t1_dbhukhv,How long does a working holiday visa last? Is it the same amount of time as a regular work visa?A lot of hotels around the world have lodging set up offsite but still owned and managed by the hotel. Is that what you mean or is it completely out of their hands?And I dont quite mean minimum. I meant more along the lines of if you have experience in a kitchen youre making more on entry. For instance in the town I work in its normal to get anywhere from  above minimum wage if you have any sort of experience in kitchens. Im about midrange in there.,movingtojapan,dbhwza2,2,t5_3fy6c

If you continue to dismiss their honest responses as being angry weebs I am happy to lock this thread and ban you from the sub.You have not done enough research. You clearly dont even know the visa basics if you believe youll be able to get a work visa with parttime sponsorship. There is a wealth of information online about getting hired abroad for English teaching. When you have more concrete questions or a more developed plan Im sure people here will be happy to help.,movingtojapan,dc3yf7d,21,t5_3fy6c

10794824,0,t3_5uc0le,I should add I live in the NYNJCT tristate area so to piggyback off what umk said about the Career Forum there is one being hosted in NYC. To be fair my business Japanese is shitty and so Im unlikely to really impress someone through that route. I assume the job offer would be for the following year anyway so Id still have that time to go about polishing my Japanese to N at the least no?,movingtojapan,ddteqwm,1,t5_3fy6c
10801396,0,t3_5sxnak,All this probably falls under the Artist category of work visa. To qualify you need either a bachelors degree I believe it doesnt have to be in that field or  years of experience in that field and you need a company to sponsor you i.e. give you a job offer and help you apply for the work visa. For a role like that where you have to face clients youll need to work your Japanese to JLPT N or above ideally completely fluent if you want to be competitive in the job market.Your best bet is to get a bachelors degree if you dont have one already and build a VERY strong portfolio demonstrating your makeup skills. Go to Japan on a general visa and job search there to find a company to sponsor you few companies are willing to interview from overseas.,movingtojapan,ddu35un,1,t5_3fy6c

11777991,0,t1_dgv1xe2,My GF when I was  had a genetic disease that prevents her to a certain degree from having puberty. As a result she was small not incredibly so just a good m and quite thin. She was kgs and as many girls her age wanted to be even thinner.She went to the hospital twice trying to do so. So to me kgs is way less than I though possible.,movingtojapan,dgv2mma,4,t5_3fy6c
11796299,0,t1_dgt8vzt,Go fuck your self you fuckin troll. What a dick!  Im just thinking out loud talking about things I dream about and you fuckin spend  minutes of your time telling me how stupid I am?  I talk about how much I admire and really love Japanese culture..not learned from a ninja movies but through some good literature...The closest thing I can get to experiencing it.  And you bash my interest? Constructive criticism is one thing but this trash. You think after  years in corporate healthcare and  years in corporate finance at a highly competitive company..the largest private healthcare company in the US and some pretty solid education on academic scholarship earned by way of a lot of blood an sweat in an institution you would never have a chance in even mopping floors one where very wealthy familys from other nations send there kids..including a lot of Japanese I can only sit at the kiddie table? Lol. Your a moron. I know itd never happen but not because you provided any valuable information presented in any valuable way but because others in this thread explained it like a real manwoman and actually gave me information..not just your self serving mockery. ,movingtojapan,dgx5fng,1,t5_3fy6c
