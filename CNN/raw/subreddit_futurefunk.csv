5031959,0,t3_3juqc7,I like Citypop and Future Funk equally and dearly check out rCitypop btw and i think I am not alone with that. Its true that a lot of Future Funk is just a rehash of Citypop which itself might be one of the most saccarine and kitschy music genres and I dont really see a problem with that. Its glossing it over with faster beats and a clean polish highlighting the luxurious and bright nature of the genre where no worries exist. A lot of the uniform style you criticised might also come from the fact that its still pretty new even in comparison to vaporwave. People are trying to find their style incorporating elements from genres such as nightcore or french house like the Pure Pure EP which you will find somewhere in the top submissions here.,futurefunk,cusjjdn,5,t5_2wqo6

6556951,0,t1_czxim1c,I dont know if it was because of the general atmosphere or what but SS was WAY better sounding live than the recordings. Just my opinion. His vocals live AND guitar playing were really good. I definitely did not know he was such a funk shredder.  Ive never seen that in a DJ set before.Edit Also half of his set felt like it was just OG Future Funk so that probably added to it.,futurefunk,czxjjl7,11,t5_2wqo6

8117786,0,t1_d4shl7t,If you look at the best and brightest in future funk right now anime visuals are less common than ever before. Most people who are doing some exciting and new musicallyspeaking have no sign of an anime aesthetic. Think about the Fibre x Aritus release and both of their individual releases Amherst Skylar SpenceCash Wednesday... even within the Future Society Collective roster you see anime pics less and less often on Soundcloud. Basically the music has absolutely nothing to do with anime or an anime aesthetic so nobody has to change genres or anything lmao ,futurefunk,d4sig0j,4,t5_2wqo6

10368974,0,t1_dcj7fkc,s drum probably from sample pack. Process timeparallel comp EQ Distortion Bitcrush Exciter etc.. drum thin and weak. You say fuller sound. Drums must be fatter and stronger. Good drums essential to Future Funk. Or just use Vengence sample pack.VST bass is good. high pass maybe to Hz. Best result is come from this. But you insist on only sample split into sample with low pass and sample with high pass. Check How to make future funk by Camino  on sidebar. Good advise. Good info. ,futurefunk,dcjdvld,2,t5_2wqo6
