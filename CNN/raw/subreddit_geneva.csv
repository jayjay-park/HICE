3249536,0,t1_coy35sx,I came from NYCNJ which ranks as more expensive than DC. Rent in Switzerland is comparable finding a place is whats difficult since merely being able to afford it isnt the top criteria. Its everything else. Avg price of a pint of beer  cocktail  dinner  if you want meat. Getting a license . Eye exam  etc...,geneva,coytmpy,3,t5_2s5qw

8140469,0,t1_d3pcg7l,I know Im very late to this conversation  question but I moved from Lausanne to Geneva and had difficulty being accepted to rent a flat foreigner that does not speak French working for a smallish company.I decided to try a relocation company and their fee was CHF . After  days they found me  flats in my price size and area. After vieweing the flats I agreed to take one and have been living there since. They handled all the paperwork registrations etc.The reason I mention this my exgf had the resources of this company at her disposal as she works for an international company. I recalled their service and opted to use them as an individual. They have multiple contacts with Regies so they know when properties are available. They also have a high aproval rate as they mostly work with international organizations.PM me if you want their details.,geneva,d4v3rcz,2,t5_2s5qw
