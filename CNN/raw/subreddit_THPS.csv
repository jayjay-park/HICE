3471725,0,t1_cpnzyna,Ive never played Ride but I would assume Ride is way way way worse.Tony Hawk HD feels like all those PS era shovelware extreme sports games. Its trying to replicate Tony Hawk but gets the feeling wrong and it just feels all sluggish and awful.I would rather play Evolution Skateboarding than Tony Hawk HD.,THPS,cpo02pn,8,t5_2tacf

5339300,0,t1_cvu5czu,Style is pointless in scoring runs now and only adds risk. For one spinning means you cant wallplant and it doesnt properly multiply the base score of tricks after the initial jump anyway. For two anything other than upflip trick means youre missing out on free multipliers. For three thanks to how inconsistent and glitchy manual balance is along with how quickly it goes to shit youre forced into these grind wallplant lines. For four accidentally double tapping might mean you do a  second Double Impossible instead of a half second Pop ShoveIt thanks to the inability to edit our tricks. For five since you cant special who the hell cares about going to a halfpipe getting another  base points when you can get another  multiplier instead?I realize that scoring isnt for everyone nowadays in the pro community but remember when you had to mix up your tricks and mix up your lines to get the best results? I miss that.,THPS,cvu5kkd,2,t5_2tacf
5340914,0,t3_3o4rli,One last question. What was the moved called when you are grinding on a ledge quickly fall and boneless fast leftright called? I need to remember how to play this game. Its been ages since I have wall shuffled.,THPS,cvuczsk,1,t5_2tacf

5392613,0,t3_3ow3k3,I dont think there is at the moment unfortunately. I know the devs were talking about adding custom levels once they have added all the other levels for the thps games so maybe they will do the same with CAS.,THPS,cw0ysvg,2,t5_2tacf

6366406,0,t3_42ta5d,To me its Tony Hawks Pro Skate  and its not even close. I liked that  added the balance bar to grinds but I had the n version of thps and it was watered down compared to what was the next gen consoles of the time xbox and ps so maybe if I had a ps or something and played the intended  it would be on the list but I didnt play that version until way later after thug came out even. I played THPS  at my friends house and really liked that you could just freeskate between missions and that the levels were so much bigger. Didnt care much for THUG THUG  or really anything after THPS  I dont care about the story mode I dont need to get off my board and in my opinion the goals sort of fell apart more after. Either way THPS  is my all time favorite and always will be.,THPS,czdagmc,1,t5_2tacf
