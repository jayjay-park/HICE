2058971,0,t3_2ieg2f,When we were pursuing a USD trading pair for Peercoin we organized an email campaign among community members. After a couple days BTCe added us. We expect things are trickier now with other big coins like NXT still not listed on BTCe. However once NuShares are publicly traded the attention it brings to NuBits should help our cause.In the meantime we have several great exchanges supporting NuBits trading www.nubits.comexchanges,NuBits,cl1jglj,1,t5_30nfe

4185292,0,t1_crxbjn6,It does sound an interesting idea. Is your thought on adding a NuBit pair an afford to drive liquidity? If so a custodian with some granted NBT would need to trade on your exchange.  How would that fit with the trust? A custodian would need to have trust within the Nu community in order to be granted the NuBits while they would also need trust on cryptoguild in order to trade.  Ill be interested to see the thoughts around this on the NuBits forum there are users there with much more economic and trade experience then me. ,NuBits,crxbqkl,1,t5_30nfe
