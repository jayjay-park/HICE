570049,0,t1_cg4yjzt,Hey Gold! Did you try it again this past weekend? They revamped the intro section. Once youre out of Coldharbour which also got some housecleaning they plop you in a main city and you skip the intro island. You can go back to the intro island now by choice. From what I hear it sounds like they are recalling voice actors and doing some massive rewrites to try to streamline the whole first experience. Itll be interesting to see if they get it done in time for the release. Also if you complete Coldharbour once you dont have to do it ever again with any other character. Edit of course if you didnt like the combat that didnt change at all or very little. ,ElderGeek,cg52ik7,2,t5_30vft
