8350736,0,t3_4tyo46,Somehow my text didnt show up. Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions. These mushrooms keep growing in my lawn. I picked several of these last night that were even bigger and threw them away. These in the pic were already shot up this afternoon in the same spot. They grow really fast.Any help is greatly appreciated! Main reason I am curious and I have dogs and I want to know if they are toxic. Thanks.,Fungi,d5le8i7,1,t5_2t5mw
