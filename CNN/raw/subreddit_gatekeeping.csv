There may not be a cure right now but you seem to be defending yourself with the belief that its normal. Its not normal.

It garnered The Mountain Goats lots of fans but they had a lowfi indy credit for years. So I think this guy was probably an old school fan feeling frustrated that his indy band was blowing up and getting popular.  great songs from Tallahassee that were used in that show other then No Children which was also used  Love Love Love Old College Tryand one more Cotton from the album We Shall All Be HealedGreat band and Id recommend them to anyone. Even more amazing is both Tallahassee and All Hail West Texas both came out the same year in . Really two of my favorite albums though I dont have Tallahassee on vinyl. They have a thick thick thick catalog. These are some of my favorites and Im not a huge fan of their early stuff because of how lowfi it is. Its grainy quality is loved by some but not me.

9820830,0,t3_5fwyw8,Its accepting the fact that not everyone is as passionate about the things you are its ok to not be a perfectionistI went through a lot of selfhate and internalization of stress when I was younger bc I was raised by a very authoritarian father punishment amp coercion to make me obey amp a very OCD mother had conpulsions that were inflicted on the rest of the household picture that no shoe can be out of line amp no surface can have any blemish as a child. If you did anything to disrupt the perfect balance it was hell to pay such as yelling spanking no meals absurd loss of electronics or grounded for weeks for silly things etcAs a result I can be very difficult to work with when it relates to something I am passionate about because I place the same controlling behavior on others get stressed if its not done just so yell or get angry at simple things get bothered by others not following my selfimposed social rules  Its about compromising and choosing your battles. Someone doesnt think its their job or worth their time to do something properly? Then you need to reevaluate the situation. Is it REALLY worth doing it a certain way? Or is it just a neurosis regarding control amp structure.  In a business setting people love me because I aim to make others understand the valueadd to perfection in their personal work amp the profit gained for the company but I dont lose my cool for some reason bc its just business. The same can be said for gate keeping. You are imposing a selfcreated stricture on someone else based on how they choose to live.If it impedes others free will amp lifestyle I.e. They think that anyone who isnt able to drink a few beers amp feel safe driving isnt a real man then you should feel the need to step up amp correct them. It could prevent something dangerous yes a weird amp extreme example but you get the point. If it merely is a way of thinking or acting edgy I.e. Someone posted about real men having beards amp that hipsters etc dont have a right to wear them then youre getting up on your high horse to feel superior for no reason other than insecurity or for the sake of principle. Does a weak person wearing a beard really affect your life? Maybe they were bullied for years over looking young or feminine amp now they can feel manly while being fashionable. But youre only making them feel worse amp more insecure so now they have to try even harder to fit a mold they werent built for.  So its best to assess the why more than the what that someone is doing. Sorry for the long post but perfectionist attitudes have affected me deeply in my life amp my relationship suffers when I lose control but Im growing amp getting better. It has taken  years to gain some control but if my stress level is high I still revert. So its not an easy change for anyone amp Im still working on it myself. I hope that helps a little. I have a loving wife amp kids who get it amp work with me amp accept me for my flaws which makes it easier to grow. Make sure the people around you are caring amp that you care about them amp it will be easier to get past it amp grow into someone better. ,gatekeeping,dano8gn,37,t5_3fkyp

My recovery will never look like anyone elses and it annoys me to no end when people in the program chide a newcomer for not following the steps to the letter. I didnt need the steps or the program. I needed friends and to see other people make it as sober people who struggled like I did with drinking and living like a relatively normal person.

When you beat a habit thats as dangerous and potentially lethal as crystal can be you earn a bit of toughguy points. Most of us cash em in it was easy I just stopped. It wasnt most likely. super addictive and can ruin lives its a physical addiction. On top of the mental cravings your body literally starts to seize up and throw a hissy fit when you stop using it this isnt the case for most drugs.Why that line should be a firm one was how easy I went from a bump or  at a rave to cut the edge off the shitty rolls that asshole sold me to hanging out in an attic with some dudes I didnt know pacing back and forth while looking out the window because I thought the cops were coming.

They couldve chosen to make him not be stereotypical. They couldve decided that their gay representation wasnt going to be the annoying loser side character who is creepily obsessed with someone who is never going to return his affection. That is not a positive or realistic portrayal of gay people. You cant gatekeep a fictional character my dude. Lefou isnt a person with thoughts and feelings.

Writing Harry Potter takes more skill than taking the world created by Harry Potter and writing what if this other character existed in this universe or what if existing characters did this other thing.Or on the other hand if the fanfiction really did display all the skill of creating original characters original worldbuilding and an original story theres no real need for it to be set in the existing universe at all.gtPortraits and life stills are just as uninspired but you dont get critiqued for drawing from life.

11282759,0,t1_df9u3fe,Your  right. Why the hell would someone go through all that training and education for just a few more dollars an hour than people in skillless jobs? Thats the whole reason minimum wage increase helps EVERYONE. Those jobs arent going to just disappearif they do then Im of the school of thought that they shouldnt have been there in the first place so then people who are hiring these jobs are going to HAVE to pay these people more or they are going to have empty positions that need filling. Its simple supply and demand. But troybolton wouldnt that just cause inflation and everyone is really getting the same pay comparatively? Well yes everyone will probably be getting paid the same percentage relative to other people but that doesnt mean they wont be getting paid more money. It would basically be a reverse of what has happened in the past decades where all the prices for everything has gone up yet wages have gone up very very little. Now instead of all the prices going up the wages will be going up hopefully. The best place for money to go in our economy is to the people who will spend it. The people who are making enough to live however they please and still leave money to their children DO NOT help our economy. Giving that money to people who will spend it as soon as they get it because they need it TO LIVE is the best possible thing for our economy. A min wage increase is one of the best ways to accomplish that. ,gatekeeping,dfavu1o,3,t5_3fkyp

Looking at APAs DSM transgenderism in it self is no longer considered a mental disorder. Here is a snippet from that article under sub category Is being transgender a mental disorder?gtA psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder.You can check out more about it here What does transgender mean?gtThis is a dumb outlook. If I kill myself because your comment made me upset are you now a murderer? Me not agreeing with the behavior and outlook of a transgender person has exactly zero causal power when it comes to whether or not they commit suicide. Trying to push the blame game like that is pure thoughtcrime fascism.But it is true you being one of many million people bullying a person makes you responsible for the result. You dont pull the trigger but you sure as h is pushing the finger. If you dont want to blamed then dont go on the internet nor any other place and spout your murderous propaganda.

11666198,0,t1_dgi1vzd,I dont mean to say that women or more feminine men cant be in the army. But the job of being a soldier is a pretty masculine profession. A definition of masculine isgt having qualities or appearance traditionally associated with men especially strength and aggressiveness.and for feminine its gt having qualities or appearance traditionally associated with women especially delicacy and prettiness.So soldiers can be on a spectrum between the two no matter their gender. Im just saying that on a list of all jobs its pretty masculine. Like how perhaps masculine men and women might be fashion designers or something and still be who they are just in a typically feminine job. ,gatekeeping,dgidn6a,14,t5_3fkyp

11716094,0,t1_dfggc5n,What an amazing response! Im glad you took the time to write it because it allowed me to realize the kind of feminism I want to get behind one that is humane and not tribalistic. Not one that points a finger at all men and assumes their inability to empathize with a specific fear of rape. This reallife manifestation of feminism is toxic to the cause and keeps people like you and me from even entering the conversation. Thanks for posting!,gatekeeping,dgo1r2h,2,t5_3fkyp
