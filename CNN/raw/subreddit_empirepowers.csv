And my Lord my heart would swell with joy if our noble Ruthenia could be lead by one of her own proud sons however I also must face facts my Lord Regent. We are at the crossroads of three nations following three faiths with three distinct cultural identities. To the west lies the newly formed Catholic PolishLithuanianHungarian Commonwealth to the south lies the Islamic Turkish Ottomans and to the northeast lies the Orthodox Muscovite Muscovy. While Ruthenia is strong we can not hope to fend off all three of these powers and if we were to stand staunchly independent and not align with any of them we would be conquered piece by piece until we cease to exist at all.

The Kingdom of Poland Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdom of Lithuania are one indivisible and uniform body and also one uniform Commonwealth which grew and consolidated into one nation from three states and nations.  They shall be headed by the Sejm that is the Senate of Nobles headed by the KingElect of the Commonwealth whos title shall be above all Kings within the Commonwealth and who shall be known as Sejm Liderem or Princeps Senatus after the Roman tradition and His Majesty the King of the Commonwealth of Nations to his subjects.  Yet these nations will retain their wholly legal and righteous customs laws and offices as well as personal standing armies for the glory and mutual protection of the Commonwealth as to be appointed by the peoples therein with respect to the rights of all nobles and brothers in Christ be they one creed or another Orthodox or Catholic unified in the blood of Jesus Christ and His holy sacrament with His people.This indicates religious freedom so long as they hold true that Jesus Christ held the power to truly perform the things He is said to have performed that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that their religious customs are to be upheld within their realms.Furthermore after the Peace of Alytus the Statute of Kalisz was extended to all creeds of all faiths including the Hussites this can be seen in section  Rzeczpospolita Narodow Miedzemorze will strictly enforce a policy of religious freedom to ensure that never again will religious fanaticism push the two nations to war.As such the peasants and clergy would not be unruly but instead would be well within their rights to declare this so long as they adhere to the legal and righteous customs laws and offices that are present within the Kingdom of Bohemia and Hungary which have allowed and encouraged religious freedom within the Commonwealth as seen by their voting yes for the furtherment of Szlachta privileges which allows all nobles to retain their lands regardless of their religion so long as they still retain that their liege is their just and righteous liege.,empirepowers,cud8u0s,1,t5_351m9

With the recent marriage  between Isabelle and Ferdinand a new problem arises since the crowns could be merged in the future and they could start working together to remove Granada from Iberia.In the past Granada also had many different problems with succession struggles and peasant wars although the current situation under Ali Abu lHasan is stable and peaceful.Granadas location is surrounded by the  Sierra Nevada mountains and therefore has a natural barrier against enemies from this side while having the rough sea on the other side of its land.Granada itself keeped on growing while the rest of Europe stagnated and even became the biggest city in terms of population in .

The army is to engage just outside the city and maintain a clear escape into the city streets should things go south. The cavalry is to peel around and thrash the flanks once a breakthrough has been achieved. The light infantry are to screen the heavy infantry and switch out positions once the Danish cavalry make their presence known. Once the battle goes in favour of the Danes the Swedish army is to retreat through the city streets towards Kalmar Castle. From there Sten Sture or a nobleman should Sture fall shall cry out the signal and call upon the citizens to rise up and fight the Danes. This should buy the army time to reorganize for a counterattack and drive back the Danes.The guns the Danes have brought along are inaccurate and light though they will wreak havoc among the cavalry.

For this he must pay.Holding up his wrists he exposes the raw marks of the binds that kept him in Limerick Castle. The council of lords gasped collectively some frowning and shaking their heads. The mere presence of a dog like him brings a danger to our interests in Ireland. I speak to you all today to press for action. We must declare war soon or risk losing our hold on the Island. Allow me as Lord Deputy and loyal servant to lead the Kings forces to victory against this seditious animal!,empirepowers,czoyxj0,2,t5_351m9

6529924,0,t1_czuq0zl,That is true and I have an offer for you that might be of interest to you.He paused.Ive convinced the Lord Deputy that should the Kingdom of Ireland be established he should appoint Lords Lieutenant to keep the peace and help manage each region including the one we are in. It might be interesting if we were both to receive such a title. The King not wanting to spend time constantly warring in Ireland is likely to accept. Being on the side of the English might mean great opportunity.Pause again.Furthermore I have come to seek mercantile connections with your local merchants. Belfast is growing and needs many trade lanes to reach maturity. Tell me Lord Butler how has Waterford prospered since joining the Hansa.Another pause.And finally my young son Conn requires a betrothal. Are you open to that?The ONeills dont hide their words. Butler could clearly see he was offering Ormond to join on the side of the crown and for his fealty receive a title and likely quite some money with that title.,empirepowers,czuquu8,1,t5_351m9

Drive them into the hills but do not go any further the slopes will prove an hindrance to both them and us. Take fire from their camps and burn them down but be wary should any hidden enemies are to be seen charging down from the hill we are to pull back and regroup. Should they not let fear and despair be thoroughly and unforgettably be burned into their hearts.OOC That hill is m high by the way. Along with a plateau around the lake I should even have a fair chance of them not noticing until its too late hah.,empirepowers,d1ea12y,2,t5_351m9
