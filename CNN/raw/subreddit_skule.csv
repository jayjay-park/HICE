9278498,0,t3_4mez63,I personally had terrible study habits in high school because I didnt have to have them  not doing homework or studying much before exams and completing assignments the day before. I did obtain high marks though which was terrible because it rewarded bad behaviour. This has definitely come to haunt me in university as Im having to build good study habits from the ground up now that I need them. Ive had to learn how to learn manage my time and cope with things like lack of motivation or not being able to stay on task for long. Its definitely a learning experience!
