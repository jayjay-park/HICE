1154185,0,t3_27756j,Ive experienced some issues with the SMS relay feature. In Yosemite the Messages app sometimes seems to forget that a certain conversation is SMS based and tries to send new texts over iMessages instead but received SMSs will still be relayed to the app just fine. Quitting and reopening Messages usually solves the issue. Also a lot of my longer messages are being chopped up into chunks of  characters instead of the usual  which has led to me inadvertently blowing up my a few of my friends phones.,iOS8,chzgmg5,1,t5_2uayf

I bet your own screenshot is a PNG? Try compressing it as a JPEG and do the same comparison.Im not saying the screenshot absolutely isnt fake just that this method of analyzing it doesnt reveal anything of interest.
