2667990,0,t3_2qk6yx,Just a bit more infoI believe they found or knew someone who was a hobbyist and he hand painted and glued them all to the base pieces. Im trying to find out where he originally bought the pieces from because Im interested in creating my own and learning more about American Civil War wargaming. If anyone has any info on a good set of rules and gameplay I can read about thatd be helpful and of course any leads on where I can get these pieces thatd be fantastic as well. They are about mm in height soft heavy metal. What I have so far on each side    base boards with  units per including color guard   One mounted general   Two cannons with four soldiers per card   Two caissons  Any help would be really appreciated!

4128198,0,t3_35mtac,At first blush I would go from rhinox to a brushing of something like steel legion and hilight that with Karan stone or maybe one lighter would be pretty close. Rhinox had a nice leathery sheen you would want. I can post some of my leathers using them later.,wargaming,crqu7lv,1,t5_2qthz
