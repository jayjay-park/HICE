2190943,0,t3_2k64kl,Man pub drafts with thought are fun to look at. Curious if you usually play with the same stack give or take one person and if they are experienced enough to play any or most heroes.Im not sure what their lanes were btw were they dual lanes on the Dire?The Radiant High HP hard to kill first picks. It kind of makes their skywrath and nuke damage weaker but they have an AA which helps a lot since Shatter and AAs built in veil. But you picked your tanks first. Your teamfight is actually a little weak. You make up for it with lockdown and aggression but it means you have to constantly fight without losing in trades too much. KOTL is your best teamfight presence honestly. I like how you said LC loses the rapier. I wonder who was playing LC. Just kidding. Maybe it wasnt the right choice I usually dont imagine getting it without huge defensive backup or its a little later game than your game. I know mek is better than urn but I feel like it had to have been late on Ogre. I also think a Vlads wouldve been the game changing aura for both teams since it seemed like a lifesteal war.Dire Night stalker is a strong hero honestly. He is a hidden gem and can carry games with is DPS but hes single target and relies on the ganks going well. Also his silence is the main reason to pick him but he you dont silence tanks at least your heroes. You pick the silence to counter cores like puck weaver ember or even brewmaster. I dont think he counters keeper of the light. But the interaction between him and KOTL Aghs is definitely funny. He doesnt counter the mid game or early game which is when those heroes both matter more. Tiny is strong and craggy helps versus your heroes a sliver of hope and ability to snowball is good. But his right clicks are what his supprots shoudl amplify. Grabbing two supports with magic damage amp instead of minus armor or attack speed buffs is the wrong way to look at Tiny. As good as blink dagger and avatoss is it wont carry you. Yeah they cant proc cold feet unless they use SWM slowavalance. I feel that he shouldve grabbed a Chaos knight. KOTL can clear the illusions but not reliably once you hit mid game.The supports technically are decent for dealing the damage needed to kill your cores but they have weak initiation early meaning the cores probably will get their farm. The Silencer no clue I cant tell if he was supporting his net worth suggests he wasnt. Unless he got the mek early Im honestly under the impression you should skip mek once the game gets to a certain point. The Tiny better have bought the Mask of Madness late game because if he went it to fight early he probably lost the game because he was the sacrificial lamb while night stalker cleaned up kills. If Tiny stay alive in fights they probably mightve pulled ahead. I think their nightstalker couldve itemized a little better. My night stalker player stopped going dominator and started going basher. If they were a five stack then even a vlads on their supports wouldve helped since you have a decent amount of physical damage. I think the lack of initation from their team probably hurt the most. No blinks only toss for jumping. Even a shadowblade couldve helped since their heroes dont usually go blink skywrath being the closest thing.,captainsmode,clibm7w,3,t5_32ux5
2866939,0,t1_cntvlc6,Doom ended up safelane with protected farm with Void in the offlane.I think you may be on to something in terms of how a role Doom restricts the gameplan whereas Death Prophet offers the ability to force the issue.The passivity of Doom  in the lane combined with Omniknights defensiveness allows Radiant to dictate the early flow whether that be to seek kill opportunities or go for tower  farming objectives.On this point I find I dont often put much thought into how picks will affect gameplan options so its a good reminder of ways we can improve our drafting on our end. In this match being on the right side of this criterion was unintended and collateral to other reasoning so hopefully next draft we can integrate that perspective with our more practiced draft philosophies.,captainsmode,cntyzvj,3,t5_32ux5
2939802,0,t1_co13bzv,That is not true. Theorycrafting has equal place with mechanics if you are mechanically proficient but make terrible decisions not only in the draft but ingame you will never win. If you are terrible with the basics of DotA but you are proficient in decision making and drafting youll also never win.One cant be had without the other saying theorycrafting is useless is circular and pointless in and of itself. This is really not the sub you want to troll with that though youll be downvoted and labelled a moron.,captainsmode,co29o1x,3,t5_32ux5
3081249,0,t3_2vgbtp,It feels a bit too situational get tell you exactly how to draft but I would consider having at least one game plan that funnels the enemy into picking to one of their signature heroes where your team is completely prepared to counter pick.  Otherwise I would just play to your strengths and ban out their signature heroes that would be thorns in your side.  ,captainsmode,cohdb6j,2,t5_32ux5

4252454,0,t3_3988ky,I never said what I thought. I think I wrote it on the original post. I was actually thinking Wisp Mid. Trilane Safe Pugna. And Chen off. I actually knew I wanted Chen off. He can gank mid and jungle if he cant sap XP. Not to mention he has a huge summon to pull the creep wave like a syllabear sand can play it like lone druid. His six is important to sustain a Pugna push. I was thinking of who to put farming priority to and I think at first it was Shadow demon but I think IO would be more helpful. I originally did something like PugnaIo mid but it doesnt sound amazing. You cant really run people down v as a PugnaIo but maybe itd be necessary when its viper mid. Rubickshadow demon only have kill potential if Chen comes in. MJ mentioned that. But if you trilane it you can disruption into Pugna blast and then liftdecrepify into the second blast. A basilius and  decent right clicks will work out pretty well and be ready to push when ChenIo are six. Their supports of lion shaman plus one would be hard if it was viper. And Ursa or Sven are relatively tanky and stout carriers. But I think unless its viper farming the Pugna trilane is stronger.,captainsmode,cs4ytxo,1,t5_32ux5
4714440,0,t1_ctors3r,hmm maybe i didnt explained myself well.yes youre right if you have many single target disables thats good you can do many different things with them and is not always bad.but remember you have a limited number of skills disposable in your team if all your skills are single target thats an opening for things like razor and different strategies like i said beforeand also a single target lineup is harder to coordinate many times but whatevur.also if you are expending your spells for the saving hero you MAY not have enough to deal with the rest of the team while if you have just  disable to catch everyone is potentialy like using  single target disables at once leaving you free to kill the saving hero before he does what he does.in a v scenario do you prefer to use  skill to stun  people and have the other spells to do the dmg or  skills to stun  people or chainstun? i think it depdends and having in a drafting phase  people with only single target ability is an opening for me to pick a counter to that im not saying he does with this specific draft but almost lets the enemy picked slark apart from gust and Unds Q what do he have?so its not always bad as i see it but it gives opening and different opportunities ,captainsmode,ctosldb,1,t5_32ux5

4975411,0,t3_3iw3o9,Normally Id say a bloodseeker first ban  AM or Qop in their drafts. ,captainsmode,culormd,1,t5_32ux5
5123088,0,t3_3kacdd,Other people criticized your draft but I think that the one strong element is that you have a lot of flexibility going into the final pick.  WR and BH can both be played offlane.  TA or WR could be played mid.  Silencer WR or TA could safelane. The big question will be where does everyone lane.  Ideally you want TA laning against Lina and WR against Huskar.  I would quickly swap lanes in the early laning stage if needed.Clock was mentioned which I think is a strong pick.  Another offlane option is CW.  His ult helps get in Drows face to disable her ults bonus agility.  He has a stun to help against Huskar.  If he can manage an aghs his team gets free pathing during his ult which will help against ES and if well timed he can mitigate  off the damage from their burst.  CW also naturally buys blademail.,captainsmode,cv3ivmz,3,t5_32ux5
5482875,0,t3_3q6cvh,Im just starting to learn to draft for my usual  stack right now so i would really like some advice.I would normally draft AA into the mix. I sometimes draft alchemist as he regens the doom damage pretty much soaking all of it. Ummmmm batrider? You just have to get the jump on him first tho.I really like a razor safelane even go aggressive if the doom is going safelane. Dont know why but i really have tons of good experience with Razor VS Doom.,captainsmode,cwchl7m,2,t5_32ux5
6403854,0,t1_czd0ok9,Going the  build gives you like  secs of a  slow or something and  bonus damage. Simply by spamming reflection you discourage the offlaner from even getting close to the creep wave should he get too close and you have a second disable or nuke and that offlaner is just about dead. He takes a bit more time to come online as a traditional carry but his laning stage is miles stronger than if you started maxing illusions,captainsmode,czhjx41,1,t5_32ux5
6533948,0,t3_44cwmt,So I am new to this subreddit and want to learn more about drafting. Am I understanding this right? The value of the Ursa first pick is the tendency for teams to focus too intently on countering him freeing up the rest of your team? If so how does the player using ursa proceed without being absolutely useless? ,captainsmode,czv5uvy,2,t5_32ux5

7623480,0,t1_d37w2y2,Which team had first pick?I think itll be kind of a tough game for Dire. Radiant has a buttload of push among DP ult SS ult BM aura and Ench creeps will be pretty hard for Dire to hold back with just Plasma Field and Impale. Dire doesnt have the push speed of their own to punish deathball with rat either. Surprised to see a lack of Nightmare synergy after a first pick Bane  Razors static link is great but they arent laning together. Similarly not much for taking advantage of Amplify Damage other than Razor  probably want to look for more physical damage for synergyI think Dire has some really strong initiation tools however so your best bet in this match would be to look for pickoffs and try to turn fights into v. Disengage from Ghosts  Serpent Wards and look for good openings to create that numbers advantage. Try to smoke whenever the enemy ults are on CD and be pretty aggressive with your roaming to force their ults out way from your towers.,captainsmode,d38qz9y,2,t5_32ux5
8095055,0,t3_4pyyyw,Im doing theoretical drafts. The aim is to create drafts that involve more creativity than an optimization of top meta heroes.Draft  Strategy Enemy lane composition disruption Push Mass scaling damage Mass disable Threat saturation Long Chaos Knight Witch Doctor Short Leshrac Jungle Axe lane cut own short lane Mid Shadow Shaman Bans Invoker because of being broken  unknownI started with wanting to create a team that synergised well with Chaos Knight. This fundamentally means a snowballfocused team.Ill start with the short lane since it sets the tone of the strategy. Suicide laning is a popular strategy and so is sending melee suicides  Axe screws this over by lane cutting not the long lane but the short lane. The suicide can choose between trying to attack Axe or trying to farm at the tower which Torturer is blowing up with his W and neither of the approaches is good. What should happen is a forced rotation from the enemy support and if the enemy has a dual long lane that would beat Axe  Leshrac Axe can simply go jungle and let Leshrac solo. The end result is the same the enemy can choose between rapidly losing not merely the long lane but the long towers or compromise another lane by rotating in an attempt to stop it. Axe should farm what he always does sustain into blink and then whatevers needed while Leshrac should go for a bloodstone.This is what sets up the long dual lane. WD can afford to get a bunch of clarity potions thanks to his heal and together with CKs own gold for clarity potions this should see them having no problem staying in the lane and then transitioning into getting kills depending on how fast the enemy rotates the support away or if it was already a solo lane. This duo can get going offensively at level  or  depending on how quickly WD needs his W and while it may not be the absolute strongest kill lane possible in the game its enough to hold its own against a dual lane and kill solo heroes. CK should aim for a midas not merely for the bonus gold but because of the bonus xp so he can get level  amp  R quicker by midasing the enemy hard camp and then boosting up with armlet and probably satanic while WD if he can afford it eventually goes for aghanims and thus like Leshrac becomes a source of teamwide high dps. Helm of the dominator adds the detail that CK can control a Centaur Conqueror which adds a  second  aoe stun to the team.Shadow Shaman mid can take it fairly easy knowing that he is unlikely to be rotated on. He can simply wait until the enemy mid feels compelled to help a lane out at which point he pushes the tower and then teleports in to countergank if feasible. Hell be going for Aghanims and a blink.DetailsThe team has   with centaur disables to set up all of the high damage spells in Phantasm Mass Serpent Ward Leshracs spells and Death Ward. All of the heroes scale well with the farm they get from the snowball strategy which leads to the saturation of threats while at the same time not needing all too much  and CK serves as a true right click carry.  of the heroes keep influencing the fight even when they die no matter who is focused  Leshracs W keeps going and bloodstone heals the team when he dies Maledict doesnt stop when WD is gone Phantasms are still active and Wards also remain intact. This makes it questionable that the enemy teams cores are going to come out alive from fights even if they manage to win like it is when playing against a Venomancer. Initiation is solid with Axe definitely and SS likely farming blinks which CK can then follow up on with W to trap the enemy core in deep waters. The teams mix of magical amp physical abilities with Axes pure damage and unblockable Q added in means that bkbs will help the enemy to not get disabled but wont do much to keep them safe from damage and some heroes will compromise their builds by going for early bkbs.Responses to basic strategies Push Shaman and Leshrac shore up the really early defense until Axe has blink and if the push is for theorys sake still too strong to defend the team can fall back on its own pushing to trade towers and rely on their scaling. Mass fight heroes The plentiful amount of damage and disables should see the team come out ahead of fights so long as they arent completely stacked against it and even then it is able to possibly disrupt the enemys laning to the point where their team falls apart before that. Core farming This strategy will be destroyed by the team because of the lane disruption combined with the pushing.Thanks for taking your time to read all this!,captainsmode,d4pygtz,2,t5_32ux5
