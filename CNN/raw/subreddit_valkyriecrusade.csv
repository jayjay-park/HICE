5924270,0,t1_cxvlp17,I do have a Griffin. Now level  and Ive not done an awakening yet.Even though I have an alliance now it is almost like I dont. There is a level  player who comes in every few days. Except for them and myself everyone is clearly inactive. And itd really suck if the level  player becomes alliance leader because one day they login  minutes before me. So it would be great if I can find a new place.,valkyriecrusade,cxw7bmb,0,t5_2xb7s

6300367,0,t3_41vj5d,User ID  adnjnPretty much you need a solid attacker right now I use GSR Toyokumono since it is a crit damage character. The best damage spiker is a x attackers like heroic Gilgamesh or Halloween hades. Crit attackers or a high x attack such as Nina right now are good just not as good. You need an attack and defense buffer I have a GUR Deomogorgon which is  damage   defense. You will like an interrupt character like Hawkeye or summer oracle that negate any enemy skill such as an attack or debuff. I use GUR Mikoterasu she can aoe and prevent attacks but not debuffs. I cover that up with a stunner aoe for  turns GUR Ishikoredome. Then as a fifth I have UR Hijirinokami for a single skill activation. It is only UR at this time cause do not have the deck cost to carry a th awoken card right now. This team can solo a .m hp fantasy archwitch but cannot do much against this current legendary archwitch because the of excessive debuffing. Once I get a GUR Nina and rank in this event to boost it more I will replace my crit GSR for her. This fantasy archwitch sucks hard with its excessively overused debuff that even summer oracle with her prevent debuff that only procs once cannot save me which is why the stun is better if you ask me. But until I get a x card fantasy archwitch we will suck but again RNG is a factor. Every  in  encounters with a fantasy my current group with decent rng can inflict around m damage before I get wiped so RNG is major. Add me if you want a comrade to help you kill.,valkyriecrusade,cz5s3ur,1,t5_2xb7s

Status how active are you Im on just about every day. I tend to be on for short periods sporadically throughout the day. Then again for the shoes at .     Comments I can beat a level  AW in  bp. I try to save  bp in case I get sent one. Alliance members get priority but most of my comrades are strong enough to not need AW help anyway. I do an average of K damage to FAW before sending. AUB battles get priority over witch battles.,valkyriecrusade,d0n3ug9,1,t5_2xb7s
7330298,0,t3_4fr02p,My guess forget Top  but aim for Top .The reason is that Top  isnt ithati good  yes that copy of Diabolic Six is useful but its clearly not good enough to devote all your time to it and blow out all your precious shoes and swords because you wont ever be able to evolve it  for that youd need Top  for reference  last time I ranked  for the first time and Im Lv .So ask yourself how many points do you make every day now? And how many brittle keys do you have how many can you spend per day after EH opens and how many points will you score there?If you look at the last event you can see that Top  made around  million points per day before EH opened and probably around  million after EH opened. And Im afraid that this time ranking after EH will be even more difficult because of how useful Diabolic Six is.Generally to improve your points you will want the following first of all make sure you will kill FAW in  BP  of the time. Using  BP per FAW already means hitting only half as many.   Then try to get enough buff to hit maximum damage and overkill as much as you can  I think . mil damage gives around  points if you manage to do around  million its k points so quite a big increase per BP. Certain cards can overkill even more but at your current level its unlikely.   Get a bunch of senders and traders. Thats because if you only hit your own FAW  youll waste lots of BP on regular AWs which give pitiful points. When running  you can just leave AWs up if youre  low on BP and save the extra vitality for the case you run into a bonus area.   Build Elemental Hall teams and farm brittle keys in bonus areas. Beginner EH is enough since it also gives plenty of points.  ,valkyriecrusade,d2belhl,1,t5_2xb7s

7660416,0,t1_d3cs3gw,Considering the only guaranteed nd Griffin is from the beginner campaign Id focus on that. You cannot get GSR without  you have to awaken Griffin as a HSR it is a worthwhile investment. Once you have  the event campaign is your best bet. The main chronicle will still be there when the event is over after all. Plus if you join an alliancehappen upon high level comrades you can get good stuff from the AWs in the event. If they are good enough they can even handle FAWs or greater with relative ease and since everyone who participates gets cards from a victory it is beneficial for them to help.Getting Griffin to GSR is somewhat time consuming but if you use her as your primary attacker shell grow gradually. It is easier if you happen to find slimes which is what the leveling on the Wiki primarily focuses on it can be done much quicker.Also unless you are going for a complete collection the N cards are basically worthless outside of upgrades and a few who can combine into R cards. Just upgrade Griffinwhoever you are focusing on or Slimes whenever you have an abundance of them.,valkyriecrusade,d3cy24c,1,t5_2xb7s
