5394515,0,t3_3ol8x2,Russell argues it is more simple that physical objects exist but Im not quite sure. Im no expert in Occams razor but it seems to me a whole universe existence is more complex than even the most complicated of illusions this goes back to anselms argument. Sure what Descartes says makes our lives more complicated perhaps to an unnatural degree but that isnt really the question when it comes to truth. However I disagree with Descartes when he says no truth can be arrived from the external world. I think there are some truths in fiction for example it seems a fact that Harry Potter has a scar and rides a broomstick at least intuitively. But if he doesnt exist how can that be the case? I think that there are some truths in fiction and value in the external world even if it is just an illusion. And as a sidenote Im wondering if choosing whether the world is real or not is a job for pascals wager,unophilosophy,cw17jud,1,t5_39kb7
