334096,0,t1_cff0j3s,Sorry Im playing with a mod that adds new dungeons but it doesnt touch planet generation so nondungeon chests are in the same location. I just went to the planet without the mod the cave is JUST to the left of the medical hut if you keep going left. Dig down into the vines go down into the cave and youll come across a chest with a gun in it. Head down the right branch of the cave and theres the chest with the mask in it.Image,StarboundPlanets,cffee0r,1,t5_2vaum

2997408,0,t3_2uig5j,Cant give you direct coords but Kiwis can be found fairly frequently on Gentle Desert planets. Look for an Oasis biome the ones with the reeds and healing water. You can find kiwis amongst the reeds. Note that they are very hard to spot because theyre small and blend in with the reeds... so just clearcut reeds until you find your seed.No idea on crystal plants... been looking for those myself. I assume they spawn in Crystal Biomes on Volcanic Fire planets but I havent found an actual plant.,StarboundPlanets,co8ogc0,1,t5_2vaum
