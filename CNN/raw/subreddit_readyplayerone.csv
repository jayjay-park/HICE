4966117,0,t1_cukgzh6,gt Parzival Yes. After analyzing the available data Ive concluded that you must be agt female.gt Artmis Why must I?gt Parzival Because I dont want to fi nd out that Ive got a crush on some  lb. dude namedgt Chuck who lives in his mothers basement in suburban Detroit.gt Artmis Youve got a crush on me?gt Parzival You should have already fi gured that out on your own Clouseau.gt Artmis What if I were a  lb. gal named Charlene who lives in her moms basement ingt suburban Detroit? Would you still have a crush on me then?There is a REASON the writer picks Detroit out of all places. Its a dig on black people. Im surprised he didnt say Tyrone and Shemika while he was at it. There is a REASON the one black person in the entire book is a FAT ugly lesbian who was raised by a single mother with no father.  There is a REASON the  asian people in the entire book are stoic unamused samurais who bow and talk about honor and say arigato.There is a REASON a non white character sacrifices himself so that the white character can live. Its cliche stereotypical bigoted bullshit. He is a got damn bigot. Whether he knows it or not is something else.  And you cant compare the single black character or  asian characters to the white male lead because guess what? There are PLENTY OF OTHER WHITE PEOPLE IN THE STORY! White people get to play every color of the rainbow. The good guys the bad guys the love interest the old man who helps out the old man who dies the bad auntie the good old lady they get to be EVERYONE. They are all white. But the ONE black is the fat cliche? The TWO asian guys are BOTH fucking samurais? If that doesnt make it clear for you then guess what? You are wearing blinders bro. There is a SERIOUS PROBLEM here and its not me. ,readyplayerone,cukin2c,-2,t5_2tpcr

5201062,0,t3_3m41qt,I was in the same boat as you. There is a definite change that happens maybe about    into the book that really turned it around for me though. I was really not digging the character or the fact that the author seemed to take pride in dropping random pointless s era factoids. However by the end of it I was disappointed that it was over. I say stick with it until the end. No guarantees but Ive read more than a couple of reviews that agree that the latter half is better than the first. ,readyplayerone,cvcx66i,1,t5_2tpcr

7981941,0,t3_4ojko6,.  Writing an autobiography about committing a crime isnt technically proof of committing a crime in the United States justice system.  Its not a legal admission of guilt even though logic dictates thats exactly what it is.  Theyd still need proof of his crime and if he covered his electronic footprints well enough they might not really have evidence to prosecute.  On top of that what jury of his peers  of the world thinks Wade is a hero is going to convict him anyways?.  Again see ..  Again see .  IOI probably wouldnt have any proof of his intranet hacking especially since he didnt actually hack in he was using logins and passwords that were in their own system.  And he wasnt actually stealing corporate workproduct either he was stealing evidence of illegal corporate activity..  OgOz didnt really help him with the contest he just helped him in real life.  Ogden didnt give him any hints on the contest itself.  So I dont think thats an issue.In the end Wade is seen as a hero by most of the world and that would include those involved in the legal system.  Most judges and prosecutors would probably read his autobiography and think he had giant balls of adamantium just like Aech did.  Theres very little chance theyd prosecute.Even if they somehow decided to do so hed actually be eligible for protection from prosecution under Federal Whistleblower Status ... once he became an IOI indentured employee his theft became whistleblowing and the information he stole would actually prove that his other crimes would be deemed necessary to protect himself from IOI.,readyplayerone,d4d8ufs,11,t5_2tpcr

They love it and pass it on I may never get my copy back but they come and tell me how much they love it. Yes they were born in the early s but that means they grew up with internet and streaming media. They are not as wellversed in s pop culture as those that lived through it but they get some of it. So what Im saying is that current teenssomethings have had enough exposure to retro games movies and music that there is no need to update the references.
