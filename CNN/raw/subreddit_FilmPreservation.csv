6639862,0,t1_d05vzix,I imagine it would. Its hard to say it this point without a detailed explanation of how the technology works. The article states that they have placed documents on to the disc. In the broadest of terms its the same principal with documents as it is with sound and video just a bunch of ones and zeros in a wrapper that makes a file and all you need is something that can read the file. Again very broad terms. It would sure help out in data preservation. If the disc is stable and more importantly readable for that amount of time it will completely eliminate the need for data migration and worries about drive failure. Furthermore with their size and potentially low cost assumption it would be easy to store multiple copies for redundancy and geographic separation. Glass has been around since at least  BC so it definitely can be a preservation medium. Im very interested in hearing more about this technology.edit clarity and spelling,FilmPreservation,d064avx,1,t5_39jv0
