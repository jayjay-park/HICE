If acts up on the road you can sort of flush carb out while riding. If debris does get in the carb needle and seat while riding turn off the fuel until fuel bowl emptydies out.

54722,0,t3_1uqbu8,Winter months are notoriously slow months for motorcycle dealerships. This is because it is cold and in most of the country the riding conditions are abysmal.So winter months like December January and February generally dont see a whole lot of demand for a new motorcycle. This isnt specific to Harley but all of the manufacturers slow down.What this means for the consumer is the dealership has extra motivation to move inventory.

But the sporty is going to be a bit cramped on longer rides I almost bought a switchback but ended up getting a fatboy lo.Although at first glance most harleys look pretty similar they are surprisingly different to ride. Particularly going from my fatboy to a mates softail standard is a huge difference in riding position feel and general comfort levels we both agreed after the swap never again it was just too unfamiliar to our normal ride. Another mate has a superglide and again that feels different to both of the others.Apart from the sportsters size once you go up to the larger bikes most positional differences can be addressed fairly easy. The made with the softail changed seat foot controls and bars ended up adding about inches of reach to the legs and  to the arms so you can always tailor the ride to suit once you find something close to what youre after.,Harley,cg8yr4s,1,t5_2rbr0

Slow dry thinner will shine more because it has time to flow but it will also run more.  Never paint lacquer on top of enamel.  Lacquer thinner will pull the enamel paint.  If you tape off for a gas cap for clear bring the tape down just a little from the top so the cap dont rub the edge of the clear.  The clear will start peeling there if it does.

Theyre still a bit on the pricey side for service though the guys seem to know what theyre doing so Im not worried. They also have a lot of really cool things like Taco Thursdays where a local food company comes out and does tacos in the parking lot while a live band plays.

1277242,0,t1_cicy8ap,If you could bump start your bike and get it home the alternator is at least charging. If the battery is even a few years old it can discharge while sitting overnight even if it had the juice to start it after half an hour. Id have someone like Napa Auto or OReillys test the battery. Replace it if its a few years old or doesnt hold deepcycle charge. If it comes back as a good battery but this problem continues your regulator is discharging when the bike it turned off. Dont need to replace the stator just the regulator.,Harley,cidb2ev,1,t5_2rbr0

Then grab some stiff wire and lay it out from the lever stop to the clutchbrakecarb stop.  Make sure that you have largeish round curves and no sharp bends in the wire and of course dont route it where it will get pinched.  This will determine your housing length.  With any luck theres a stock length available for you.  If not youll have to order.  And dont be afraid to email Barnetts as theyre super helpful.Also if youre using an SampS or other dual throttle carb be careful not to get the return closing cable too long as it will make it impossible to close the throttle completely and youll be backfiring all over the place.,Harley,cjl83t7,2,t5_2rbr0

Stretching out is really nice too. At  tall I looked like a monkey fucking a football on my sportsters. Corning is just as good on this bike in my opinion.

2840701,0,t3_2sfa6c,If the bike has been properly maintained with all the correct service intervals and inspections done  miles is still a relatively fresh motor and tranny. At  miles harley recommends a complete fork rebuild and replacing the fork stem bearings. Im guessing the seller wants to avoid the cost of the  mile service among other things.Look at Street glides on Craigslist within a  mile area of you. You will see a lot of overpriced bikes but occasionally you will see a bike listed for a reasonable price for that year and model with somewhere near those miles on them. When youve seen two or three or four reasonably priced bikes you can bet that they will probably sell for  less than the asking price.If the bike has never been laid down or wrecked and if all of the correct service intervals have been done preferably by a licensed shop or the dealer its not a bad deal to buy a bike that age with that many miles on it. My  Road King has  miles on it and I just did the complete fork rebuild and put  weight fork oil in it and it rides like a new motorcycle.You can find a .pdf service manual for that bike online and maybe someone here has one or you can go to the Harley dealer and ask them for an exact list of the service required on that bike and maybe they will Xerox a copy of the service requirements page from the service manual for you. Also maybe someone here will have one they can take a photo of and post here.Right around  miles the fuel filter should have been changed inside the gas tank. If it hasnt been thats another cost to worry about. If the seller claims the bike was serviced at a dealership they will have records of every service done on the bike and if the seller is being honest but doesnt have receipts he should be willing to go down to the dealer with you and print out copies to prove it since youre talking about a lot of money.,Harley,cnqzgih,1,t5_2rbr0

2958006,0,t3_2tz8fy,I recently moved to Phoenix. Down here in the valley it is easy to ride year round without heated gear. So far the coldest day I wore a jacket over my sweatshirt. Higher up like Payson there is snow and it gets colder. Down here you can find places with a garage for under  in decent parts of town. Sun city is full of retirees and fairly inexpensive. As far as riding goes I highly recommend it. Even on a touring bike pushing  miles a day is tough. I rode from KC to Tampa and back last fall. You can ride longer but it gets monotonous. As far as the necessity of a garage goes I would recommend it if you like to keep a clean bike. It is quite dusty here. I currently have a carport and a nice cover but my bike is always dirty.

Also the shadow is not a twoup bike so if you do a lot of riding like that its not for you either.the shadows make great baggers though!it would be VERY expensive for you to go this route though to mount the harley bags you need to build a custom bracket like I did and the stock exhaust will not work with bags so I built a fully custom true dual system with screamin eagle mufflers.unless your a fabricator you wouldnt be able to pay a shop to build the brackets and custom exhaust for less than .there are no bolt on parts to make a shadow bagger to the degree that mine is done.if you really want a street bob save up and get one.  if you dont get one every other bike will just be the in the meantime bike while you still wish on that street bob,Harley,coqfhyl,1,t5_2rbr0

Its spreading back to the point that theres a Sacramento race here in CA again. But Ill tell you I have NEVER seen a flat track race that looks like its on a bouncy bump motocross dirt track. Its almost like these riders have never raced flat track before. Is this possible? Its obviously something different from what I used to watch. There was National!!!! TV coverage of Harley racing back in the s and the bleachers were filled to capacity.This is what flat track looks like on an AMA Dirt Track Fast Forward to . if you want to just watch the grand finale for the day.

4948418,0,t1_cuhxikx,gt The point is you cant just say that because there are lots of sportsters on craigslist that they wont sell for very much. Yes I can and thats just the way it is and the simple fact is that when you can buy a low miles likenew   speed EFI Dyna for under  I passed on a pristine  FXDC with K miles on it with a Mustang seat FXDP footboards and windshield Stage  upgrades and a really nice exhaust for  three weeks ago. Only someone whos not doing their homework or is laser focused on a specific dream bike to the point of being irrational is going to pay a dime more than that for a three or four year old Sportster... unless the buyer is a complete sucker with more money than sense. Normal who knows you might find a buyer at that price dynamics just dont apply when theres a hundred other bikes available for the same or less money. As others here on rharley have pointed out just about everybody modifies their Harley so mods are personal choices for the person who put them on the bike and dont add value to a used bike with the possible exception of top shelf performance mods and even then they still dont bring more than  cents on the dollar. Theres lots of  year old Dynas out there with a brand new  SampS motor in them and these bikes dont sell for much more than the bone stock one sitting next to it on Craigslist in likenew condition thats selling for . Stage  upgrades dont add more than a few cents per dollar spent and neither do handlebars seats skull trim spikey things and so on unless theyre exactly the mods you already planned to make. In fact many mods are gonna limit the number of potential buyers rather than increase that number.Besides most people wont pay a dime more than they absolutely have to and they can get one helluva lot more bike for less money in almost any city in the US. Sure there are always gonna be suckers and people who are blinded by the bling and make lousy decisions like financing a  year old Iron from the dealer for more than the bike cost when it was new had someone admit to this in my FXR thread a few weeks back but theyre the exception not the rule and dealer sales are a different universe than trying to buy or sell a bike on CL or ebay. Almost all dealer sales are for a  premium over private sales simply because they can offer warranty service plans dealer support and throw in things like free tires for life or whatever and then theres the handy financing. Harley sells over  brand new motorcycles every single year and most of them in North America. For every owner who puts K miles on their bike in two years theres a hundred who dont put more than K on their bikes in  years. Ever since the Sons of Ikea became a popular TV show the popularity of all Harley models has skyrocketed as a shitload of first time buyers who would never have bought a Harley went down to the dealer and bought their fantasy bike. Theyve sold a shitload of Dynas since thats the bike featured most on the show but all models sell and sell and sell except maybe the VRod models which sell better in Europe than they do in the states. Most of these bikes come on the market with very low miles on them in likenew condition and will eventually sell for very little money compared to what they paid for them new. The ONLY way to get Blue Book value for most used Harleys is to trade it in on a new bike from the dealer Road Glides on the west coast and Softails in the midwest and south seem to be in high demand and will fetch close to blue book. ,Harley,cuiae5d,1,t5_2rbr0

This is a licensed collectible deal notice the limited editions of  offered by a HD dealership where people buy a bike with licensed brandstheme on it. Its the same as buying a collectible Dodge car with a licensed marvels avengers logo and theme on it or a Captain America motorcycle. The kind you normally see on sweepstakes. Ive seen this bike up close and it looks pretty nice I really like the tank although personally I would like it better without the branding all over it.

Thats bullshit.BUT swapping fork tubes means pulling the axle and front wheel and axle pulling the front fender easier than trying to get the fork tubes lined up right if the fender has any torsion on the mounting bolts then unbolting the brake calipers from the fork legs unbolting the triple clamp pinch bolts from the top and bottom trees then lowering the fork tubes out of the triple trees removing the existing boots installing the fork gaiters then reassembling everything in the opposite order. While its apart and if it hasnt been done recently he should repack the fork stem bearings with grease can be done with a grease gun and reload the fork stem bearings. Make sure he has the factory service manual and follows the instructions for removal of brake calipers without removing the brake lines removal of the front wheel removal of the fork tubes from the triple trees and reassembly. Hes gotta torque every nut and bolt to the manuals specs which means torque wrenches. The brake calipers take pt sockets or splined sockets to remove and reassemble the calipers. Make sure he uses blue LocTite on any fasteners even those with lock washers and if its a dual disc front end make absolutely sure the tire rotation is the right direction its market on the tire but you can use a white or yellow grease pencil to indicate how its sitting on the bike before removal. ,Harley,cvd53ez,5,t5_2rbr0

5524105,0,t1_cwhnr8y,Yeah use the right tools to take your primary apart. Typically a tiny bit of metal will gather on your drain plug from both the primary chain wearing and the clutch fibre discs tabs or ears will deform and fragment slightly where the fit into the slots in the clutch drum. If theres more than a pinheads worth of metallic on the drain plug if its fuzzy or worse has visible bits of metal on it its time to pull things apart and look closely.Heres a video of a guy pulling the primary on an Ultra Classic but the clutch and compensator should be the same on our bike The first  minutes is removal. This guy gets away with using a piece of wood to lock the primary drive in place but Id use this before Id use the Derin wedge that is available as a primary chain lock. Even with the video for guidance use the Harley factory service manual and the right tools! Heres a .pdf service manual for a . It should be close enough to identical The compensator nut is not coming apart without damaging things without a primary drive locking tool of some kind. This is what the steel primary locking tool looks like This guys a bit of an idiot but his video will show you a different tool Delrin wedge chain lock to get the compensator apart and the clutch drum off the bike The guy in this video takes a couple short cuts and get away with them. The Delrin primary chain locking wedge is a shortcut and I dont recommend it for this but if you have things go exactly like he did everything will be fine but Id recommend the steel tool or even wood?!?!? as the wedge puts lateral torque on the primary chain and adjuster rather than the steel of the clutch drum and the compensator sprocket taking the strain and putting linear torque on the chain. I suspect the wedge can lead to chain distortion and adjuster damage if you manage to fuck things up.The correct steel  tool can be fabricated from x steel steel cut to length measure from the two points on your bike where the tool fits in the photo of the tool. You dont need to buy the official Harley tool but you can get a Jims primary locking tool on eBay cheapish. Or I guess and I cant believe Im saying this a piece of x pine cut to length seems to work too. Make sure you get the right length tool for your bike. FXRFLT takes one length Sportsters take a different length and Dynas Touring and Softails take a third length entirely so read the description carefully on any tool you order. Dont forget to remove the chain adjuster nut and washer. Theres a locking tab on some of them that you have to bend back before removing the nut. Again the service manual will tell you about yours. Harley had several different compensators in the last  years so depending on which one you have when you get the compensator nut or bolt off the compensator will be ready slide off in your hand once the clutch hub is free but removing the compensator sprocket will require removing the clutch hub and drum comes off in one piece with the chain attached. Remember its torqued on there at something like ftlbs so you need a long breaker bar or torque wrench to get it turning. The clutch hub nut isnt torqued to even half that but it can be a bitch to get off too.... the clutch hub nut is a left hand thread!!!!Once the clutch hub nut and compensator nut or bolt and chain adjuster are undone the whole works will slide off as one piece. Examine the ramps on both pieces of the compensator one side will sorta like sine waves with one side of the wave showing wear on both parts. If one side of the ramp or the contact point on the gear is worn to the point that the it has a noticeably deformed its time for a new compensator. Lemme see if I can take some pics of a wiped out compensator I have in the garage so youll know what youre looking at. Wont be for a couple hours so youre on your own until then. Google images will probably show you if you search for worn out Harley compensator or faulty or time to replace the compensator or compensator damaged or whatever get your GoogleFu together. If the compensator is just slightly worn thats probably not the source of your metal in the oil.Now its time to look at the splines on the clutch hub. Once the clutch drum is off the bike turn it over and look at the internal splines where it slides over the mainshaft. If those splines are beat up or broken youre gonna have to replace the clutch hub and that means pressing the old hub and bearing out of the clutch drum and pressing the new clutch hub and bearing into the clutch drum. I have a clutch hub in a box of junk parts that had this happen. Ill take pics of it when I take pics of the fucked up compensator. If the splines are fine and the compensator is fine pull the clutch pack and look at the tabs on the fiber discs that fit into the slots on the outside clutch drum. They get deformed and damaged and a tiny bit is normal. If theres obvious damage its time for new clutches. Examine the steels between the clutch pack too. MAKE SURE you get things reinstalled in the correct order if you take the clutches out of the hub. Putting a fiber disc against an aluminum pressure plate will destroy the pressure plate in short order and put aluminum powder in your primary oil which will wipe out the clutch hub bearing the mainshaft support bearing and the primary chain. Follow the service manual for disassembly and reassembly and use the correct tools. You need a gtftlb torque wrench the appropriate sockets and red high strength LocTite to reassemble the compensator and clutch hub nut. You need blue  LocTite higher temp and oil resistance than the old  the book calls for for the primary chain adjuster the clutch diaphragm retaining plate bolts and the primary cover screws and for the controlspegsfootboard that came off to get the primary cover off. Again the clutch hub nut is a left hand thread!!! Dont fuck it up. Its a good time to examine your inner primary seals while everything is out of the bike.Everything goes back together in the opposite order. The service manual will tell you exactly how. BONUS!!!!! This is what happens when someone decides that they can make do without the correct clutch hub puller for an early FXR clutch and goes on about how Harley is just scamming them by saying use this tool... right before breaking his clutch hub.  This is not the clutch youre gonna deal with but I thought Id include it just for fun. Do NOT be this fucking moron ,Harley,cwhr5m3,1,t5_2rbr0

6774282,0,t3_48cz2v,I just did these on my .  I also changed bars at the same time so I have information about some stuff and none about other.  It looks to me like youre going to have to cut the grip off the throttle tube when I bought these   as you can see from the photo the grip is a throttle tube also. It has the little notches for the throttle cables.  So you may have to cut the grip off the existing throttle tube. I believe revzilla has a better throttle tube for sale also. As for the clutch side should be easy cut the old grip off glue on the new one. Mine wasnt connected under the housing or if it was I dont remember like I said I changed bars at the same time so everything came off. I hope this helps.

Lots of us have a moment when we realize were missing something or someplace or time gone by and as often as not its on the bike when it happens more so if youre someone who spends much of your free time riding. For you its the flat farmland. For me its the California hills and mountains. Ive moved away from the SF Bay Area twice in my life once to the Sierras for  years and once to the Redwood Coast and the Trinity Alps for  years for exactly the same reasons. Thats where I find peace of mind. Thats where I can get on the bike and be alone in the countryside in  minutes or so.Today Im back in the Bay Area again dads health is failing and I have a great job here but I head for the hills on my days off. Its only  minutes to Hwy  in the Sierras and a day on the bike in the hills every week is just what the doctor ordered sometimes its two days in a row if I dont have anything going on. When my dads gone could be next week or  years from now at this rate Ill move again and start over... again just to have that peace of mind that riding the hills every day brings that allows me to go the long way to work  miles of mountain blacktop with few or no traffic signals or stop signs and damned near no cars on the road.

Starting a club before theres enough of you to actually be a club smells way too much like wannabeism. If its not thats great but theres so many people who dont know shit about the difference between an MC an RC or an MA who have done their best to make existing clubs look bad and generally fuck things up for people who do go through the correct motions to become a club that tempers are short on the subject. As for other peoples responses weve spent the afternoon with a brand new profile signing on and volunteering to answer questions about outlaws clubs having obviously never spent a day around established outlaw clubs beyond watching Gangland and Sons of Anarchy then stating he just started the club himself a few months ago yet claimed brothers from out of state patching out members in a couple weeks respect for fellow ers in the Iron Order and other asinine stuff no selfrespecting er would ever say then lecturing the odd patch holders and ers who do participate here on what it means to be an outlaw. If thats not you or your buddy you started the club with you might wanna ask him its a bald coincidence that he deleted his post about  minutes before your brand new profile posted about a new MC and asking a question that begs the fact that two guys aint an MC its a couple of riding buddies who want to wear a patch as far as established MC members and outlaw history are concerned. If you want friends go make friends. If you wanna wear a patch earn one or gather enough dedicated brothers who a want the same thing and do it that way. No CoC sanction is going to be given to two guys calling themselves an MC and without CoC sanction youre risking serious problems. ,Harley,d60ld1j,3,t5_2rbr0

10372043,0,t3_5ojelu,Fullface helmets at least from my experience dont limit youre view. They also keep shit from hitting you in the face if you dont have a windshield as well as help keep your face from freezing to death when its cold. Also theyre supposed to be better in a crash. I wear a full face when I do wear a helmet which is pretty much when its freezing cold or Im going on a longer trip since my bike doesnt have a windshield and I like it that way. Half helmets from my understanding are more for getting by state helmet laws or if youre seeking a more free feeling when riding bugs in your teeth etc.. Somebody will probably chime in with a real reason to wear them. I have owned half helmets didnt really do anything for me. But at the end of the day it comes down to personal preference and how much risk youre willing to accept. As far as school if you mean college I have never had a problem riding and parking it on campus. Nobodys ever fucked with it.

11217081,0,t3_601unf,It kinda looks like the Le Pera that was on my SuperGlide when I bought it. Uncomfortable as fuck in my humble opinion. Felt like I was riding higher than the fuel tanks. Flip through a Drag Specialties book youll find it. I think HD sells one kinda like too. Its a Long Distance Touring Seat or something similar I think.,Harley,df3fxwe,1,t5_2rbr0
11227971,0,t3_60a6ht,Nope you will be fine.  Harleys are not as aggressive as street bikes.  I ride a  super with the ci.  It can get up and go but it will putt around just the same.  The only thing i can say is get used to the weight at low speeds.,Harley,df4oc67,3,t5_2rbr0

11250158,0,t3_60k6si,My first question is where are the rest of the wires? Youre going to want solder heat shrink and a soldering irongun and matching color wire would be a good idea. ,Harley,df76t9c,1,t5_2rbr0
11257803,0,t1_df7it5g,Thanks! I got the lift amp keycoil relocate kit from Kinetic And as far as cost its hard to say  it really depends who you go to and im assuming where you live plays a small factor in that as well. A lot of the shops in Los Angeles and Venice BeachLong Beach charge more of a premium  a lot of it has to do with reputation but I feel location is a huge factor where i reside IMO.But in all reality all this that I did was really really easy stuff. Half the fun of owning a Harley is working on it yourself! You really just need the most basic set of tools standard sockets socket wrench set of allenhex keys phillipsflat head screwdrivers etc  you can get most of these tools at Lowes..big fan of KobaltGearwrench brand for the money.  PM if you ever need help!,Harley,df81zo0,2,t5_2rbr0

11275065,0,t1_df9v2vb,no it has over k miles on it. Its just been a while since I took it on a long trip I usually just stay around town.,Harley,dfa0g9v,1,t5_2rbr0
11299279,0,t1_dfcqlx1,I dont think so.  Just because Polaris decided to focus their tooling and investments on their other line doesnt mean that Victory Motorcycles arent  werent a force to be reckoned with.   Besides its not like Polaris will just abandon everyone who owns a Victory Motorcycle.  You cannot argue that Victorys wasnt a very reliable well built motorcycle.  Certain Victory lines will just be rebadged as Indian anyways.Edit  Indian Victorys Sister Line is using the same technology.,Harley,dfcr8o3,3,t5_2rbr0

11392144,0,t3_62j2ei,Interesting. I get the tourism aspect.I spent a few years and many many summers in Wisconsin and Upper Michigan growing up I remember hearing how the French Canadians despise Americans venturing up their way or even worse buying a house or property in their province. ,Harley,dfna6ws,2,t5_2rbr0

11555467,0,t3_64x2fm,The Street Glide is a big bike but I think once you get moving on it youll be surprised at how light and nimble it feels once its in motion.  I just use the toe shifter but havent removed the heel shifter.  They make a kit to remove the heel shifter if you want its cheap and simple.  I just havent bothered because it still just shifts like any other bike  just with the option of a heel shift if you should feel so inclined.,Harley,dg5te03,7,t5_2rbr0
11561316,0,t1_dg68xud,It acts like a clutch slip. Only when warm between nd and rd under load.  Before it starts slipping it will jerkstutter. Grinding started after I put new screaming eagle clutch kit. I am installing  piece inner primary bearing and a new clutch spring tomorrow to see if that might be it.  ,Harley,dg6ha3k,1,t5_2rbr0
