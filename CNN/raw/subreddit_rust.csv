532330,0,t1_cfz4szv,Yeah.  No real technical limitations since ObjectiveC also uses LLVM and there is no JIT or required dynamic linking.  I have not tried it but if you did want to run Rust code on iOS I think you would output LLVM bitcode and link that with your ObjectiveC code.  Im sure this will be fixed eventually since I think it will be a requirement for Servo when it gets off the ground a bit more.I also have no real issues using ObjectiveC for UI code.  The safety guarantees are less applicable.  Although I think it may be interesting to use Rust for canvas type UI in an OpenGL layer or any other very complex custom UI.  It is pretty easy to forward events gestures accessibility data etc. from Rust to a UIView or NSView. ,rust,cg0s6z8,2,t5_2s7lj

Haskell Ruby and others have them but they are a bit more primitive. The only really bold choice they made was to not have implementation inheritance which I think was a great decision. Also the tooling they provide is excellent go and gocode are like an instant IDE wrapped up in two command line apps.That being said I think the one thing people overlook about Go is that its a very small language making it very easy to pick up.

1688556,0,t3_2dq5fm,I see memory safety and security as fundamentally quite related. The quintessential example of this is the Heartbleed vulnerability. You leak the wrong memory back to clients. Im not sure using C would do anything to help that. But Rust definitely would.gt InfoWorld What about the issue of security in programming? Is there anything that developers need to do as far as securing their programs? Is C a more secure language than others?gt Stroustrup Im a great fan of hardware to aid security. In terms of programming languages if you want to write good programs write your code typesafe. You can do that in C. Dont mess around with lowlevel features all the time. And dont go to fully general interpreters where you cant track what is going on. Basically security is a systems issue.I was quite impressed by the answer Stroustrup gave to this one. If you read between the lines he seems to be sayinggt Providing good securitysafety guarantees is not a programming languages issue.Which I think is fundamentally wrong this mindset to security works when your program can interact with the operating systemhardware enough that it can actually exploit the safety guarantees in this interaction.But most software is going to do its work within its own process  and the design goal for an OS process is to provide the illusion that You own the entire system the whole memory space and everything in it.Thus your buffer overflowsuseafterfreesetc. are not something that can be checked at the systems level unless your process attempts to leave its assigned memory space and has to be checked within the application itself.The reality is  yeah we could redesign our entire notion of operating systems to provide different safety guarantees. But with the OSs that we have right now and the hardware that we have today your route for strict safety guarantees is in programming languages that offer them whether its Haskell Rust or whatever else can actually manage to provide them.,rust,cjs08xq,17,t5_2s7lj

1795134,0,t1_ck52zpq,Yep some of the biggest ways increasing transistor counts speed up processors have to do with instructionlevel parallelism or ILP. For anyone whos interested in what that meansPipelining instructions means youre executing many of them in parallel at different stages superscalar architectures have multiple pipelines that execute independent instructions in parallel outoforder execution dynamically reorders instructions when later ones can be executed before earlier ones finish like long memory loads speculative execution continues the pipeline through guessed branches SIMDvector instructions run operations on collections of data.A lot of those optimizations especially pipelining allow for faster clock rates because less work needs to be done each cycle on any single instruction before you can get started on the next one. But problems like data dependencies mean theres only so much ILP that can be extracted by the compiler or CPU before youve reached the limit of Amdahls law thus more cores that dont automatically speed up your program but that the programmer has to use manually rearranging things to give it more parallelism.There are some other ideas that havent really made it very far VLIW CPUs have the compiler specify which instructions to run in parallel rather than having the CPU figure it out because the compiler can see more of the program at once and take longer to think about it and software pipelining runs multiple iterations of loops at once in different stages just like hardware pipelining runs multiple instructions at once. These are pretty tricky to make work in a lot of situations the Itanium and Transmeta CPUs pretty much failed how does a VLIW machine handle unexpectedlylong memory loads if the CPU cant use outoforder execution? etc. but progress is being made just not as fast as the days of wooooo tons of unexploited ILP everywhere. For example see the Mill CPU,rust,ck5fc7b,9,t5_2s7lj

1918249,0,t1_ckkas6x,Oh man I was secretly hoping nobody would ask questions. I created a github repo from some source files as a quickanddirty backup about twenty days ago Its incomplete all around so it should be interpreted mostly as a doodle.This is a project for a compiler design course that Ill eventually finish at my college. I had been previously been working with SML which is a fantastic language for representing mathematical ideas. Algebraic datatypes and pattern matching made it a great language to write my notes for this project in. However I wanted the speed and familiarity of your average curlybrace language i.e. CCJava. I quickly ran into the road block that without pattern matching certain things which are very terse in idiomatic SML are incredibly verbose in idiomatic Java or C. Then I discovered Rust this summer and have totally fallen in love.The tokenizer was the first thing I wrote and its very elegant. Im sure Im still pretty bad at writing Rust code but the fact that I could make my code look that pretty despite my inexperience is a testament Rusts design.

Its nonstandard in C and often results in very brittle code that can be really hard to debug when something goes wrong and wipes out the stack. To get the C equivalent of this in Rust all thats needed is to expose the LLVM alloca intrinsic. I dont like this idea though since this seem to be just porting a buggy feature from C.

2175897,0,t1_clfot1c,Yes absolutely I only know of RuntimeCompiledC. There are also a number of systems for doing it with C look at For the last couple of months Ive been thinking and planning a lot for writing my own live programming languageIDE. For live programming the need for hot code reloading is obvious. For the implementation language Im still not sure candidates are either C Rust or Elixirruns on the Erlang VM. They all have their different advantages.I have to say that Rust is very tempting to use and I think it should be possible to do hot code reloading without being too ugly.. with compilergenerated Rust code for state transfer but I would miss these things   A mature GUI toolkit and lots of libraries like you would have in C.   Powerful macro system like you would have in Elixir. Really hope Rust developers can find some inspiration there.Anyway back to the topic of dynamic loading... What I imagine could work correct me if Im wrong or missing something!   The executable is a small runtime system that loads your application code from a dynamic library using stddynamiclib. It then calls your librarys main which has nomangle attribute set.From you main eventloop    include a watch for the reload command to come over a socket or such   do you normal application stuff but if the command to reload comes copy stack variables to heap exit your main function with a return code to signal that it should not exit but instead be reloaded and also pass a pointer to a struct with all stack datawhich in turn points to the rest of your state.   control is now back in the executables code. It can unload old library load new library call the main function there and pass on any old state.   the new library main can detect that it is not starting from scratch but should copy existing state in to itself instead of initializing from scratch before returning into the event loop.This is basically how Kitsune does it for C. For rust memory safety features you dont get any safety across from the main executables code into the dynamically loaded stuff. But I assume it should be fine within your dynamically loaded rustcode? And since all the interesting stuff is in the library control never leaves it until its time to exit or reload it should be fine.Open questions I have not had time to research yet   I assume that compiling a library for each task is out of the question? Could they communicate if they were dynamically loaded from separate libraries?   Any funny things going on in the Rust runtime that would make this not work?  ,rust,clgeqrh,3,t5_2s7lj
2180187,0,t1_clgxtb6,LLVM was designed as a C compiler backend.  C and related languages use very small compilation units typically one .c file.  To parallelize a C build you just use make j and its much cleaner than putting concurrent data structures all over your compiler.Computers have much more memory now compared to when C was designed and Rust picks a much bigger default compilation unit the crate.  Unfortunately to unlock all the optimizations within a crate you need to process it all in a single LLVM context which means one thread.C and C are also increasing the de facto compilation unit size with LTO and unity builds.  But they dont have anything like the module  crate distinction which makes the ergonomics pretty bad.,rust,clgydll,10,t5_2s7lj

And Id guess the ordering of these three is also intentional. That focus on safety is one of the core features of Rust and I for one love it because of that. So if you dont appreciate a system programming language that focuses on safety there are plenty of other languages available. Look elsewhere.This being said I dont think theres any reason why Rust cant get reasonably fast IO. This is just not the focus at the moment.

So you want to implement PartialEq  which has the eq method  and then then have an empty implementation of Eq. You could do all that but since the implementation would be very logical  just comparing the fields  you can make the compiler to it for you just add derivingEq PartialEq over your struct definition and it fills in the impl for you. ,rust,clqs6ts,4,t5_2s7lj

Thats exactly for the reason not having to deal with shared state and to have an easy programming model. Its also good for performance because it avoids context switches and cache invalidations for things that belong together.But hey what do I know?

Organization of article  ASCII sfw gtThe code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification. The first two columns  positions were reserved for control characters.  The space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position hex  for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits. The committee decided it was important to support upper case character alphabets and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable character set of graphic codes  as was done in the DEC SIXBIT code. Lower case letters were therefore not interleaved with upper case. To keep options available for lower case letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter A was placed in position hex to match the draft of the corresponding British standard.  The digits  were arranged so they correspond to values in binary prefixed with  making conversion with binarycoded decimal straightforward.gtInteresting ASCII art | ASCII Corporation | ASCII Media Works | PETSCII Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwclvrtf oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeleteclvrtf.

A surprising number of people are waiting for Rust to stabilize when that happens I expect explosive growth for the Rust ecosystem.But theres a fundamental issue that I addressed in my conclusion and you touched on in your reply is Rust even the right tool for this job?Maybe it would be better to mainly use Julia because its designed for this purpose and then write extensions in Rust that you might otherwise write in C if you had the need or desire to do so. A lot of people in the Rust community including myself have a strong desire to develop a diverse and comprehensive pureRust ecosystem but we also accept the fact that some things just dont work well in Rust or otherwise its just not worth reinventing the wheel. And I think thats perfectly fine.Fortunately because of Rusts emphasis on transparent C interop its not at all necessary to have a pureRust ecosystem or reinvent the wheel. Rust can call into the same C extensions built for Julia or NumPy or any other scientific computing library though those extensions are probably designed for interop with their respective languages and are likely littered with the C representations of their higherlevel types.If you want Rust to have better support for scientific computing I dont think itll happen if you just stand around and wait. Libraries and tools happen when people are interested in a language but see something missing and have the gumption to take it upon themselves to fix that.

I can explain more about this algorithm if you want to. sort |uint uint| gt int is almost correct but you need to give the full type of closure which includes the lifetime bound on the captured environment of the closure. In your case you probably dont need to support closures that capture elements so you can just require the static bound to only allow closures that dont capture anything or rather only capture compile time constants.So the type of your field would be sort |uint uint|static gt int.

This does add the overhead of a vtable lookup but I think that is a fair trade off.By accessing entities with related components currently with a macro to be rewritten as a custom iterator as an iterator the AnyMap lookup only has to be done once. This is a big point since the hashmap lookup is expensive.Fragmentation is solved by reuse as HeroesGrave. I have versioning too although Ive moved to a single integer  bitshifting although I need to check if this is actually an improvement over having two fields. Reuse is done in FIFO order with a minimum free indices check so fragmentation isnt zero but this allows a smaller field for version again this is something I need to check is worthwhile.I also have a simple System implementation.Note that its very much workinprogress but feel free to take a look One of my goals which is something I like about OPs implementation too is to keep the code simple and clean.,rust,cn89u4j,1,t5_2s7lj

The only way we could be better would be to not require lifetime params. In fact that is the case in many cases due to the lifetime elision rules.

3009631,0,t3_2unihn,This is a blog post made when the changed landed to explain what all these new changes were about  . An excerpt from itgt  Slicing syntaxgtgt Slicing syntax has changed from fooa..b to ampfooa..b although that might not look like much of a change it is actually the deepest one Ill cover here. Under the covers we moved from having a Slice trait to using the Index trait. So ampfooa..b works exactly the same way as overloaded indexing fooa the difference being that slicing is indexing using a range. One advantage of this approach is that ranges are now first class expressions  you can write for i in ..  ...  and get the expected result. The other advantage is that the borrow becomes explicit the newly required amp. Since borrowing is important in Rust it is great to see where things are borrowed and so we are trying to make that as explicit as possible. Previously the borrow was implicit. The final benefit of this approach is that there is one fewer blessed traits and one fewer kind of expression in the language.,rust,co9y2ix,15,t5_2s7lj

The borrow is to static memory but the lifetime still pretends to be on the stack.   If you really need it you can transmute the reference and it should work if you could put that ampCONST expression inside a const items initializer.Of course thats a hack. For properly exposing that new property we need an RFC.

3457444,0,t1_cpmd3jd,gt such as having two mutable reference to the same location whose life time outlives both of the referencesgt Yes this can occasionally cause bugs but its not unsafe. It depends on your definition of unsafe. And Rust includes things like iterator invalidation in its definition. The reason behind this rule is basically that  in large codebases mutating the same object from different functions is almost the same thing as a data race in threaded code. E.g. I might be using and mutating something in a function but whilst doing so I call another function which after calling more functions eventually also mutates the variable. Looking at a function one cant tell if the variable will be mutated by one of the functions it calls unless you follow all the functions back to source which is a ton of work in a large codebase.These bugs are pretty hard to catch and arent as rare as it seems. We use RefCell in Servo for interior mutability and it has caught some bugs cant remember which of this kind though RefCell does this at runtime.gt  Plenty of languages manage to do this just fine without using unsafe code they just use a GC. You can do the same in current Rust with a combo of Weak and Rc. Sure Weak is a harder concept to grasp but also theres nothing preventing Rust from having a GCd pointer. We used to and it should be easily implementable as a library at least a threadlocal GC  I would expect that post.  there would be GC implementations lying around that you can use. ,rust,cpmdhj6,15,t5_2s7lj

Its not that Rust shouldnt support OOP code its more that the traditional method of supporting it is likely to not be orthogonal to existing features and so an alternate solution is likely to be needed.

That still leaves a difficulty with negative integers. P could not work.I could use P to mean positive  and N to mean negative one which is what tylar does. However that still has the difficulty of what do you call Zero? I would want something of a similar form but theres nothing that really makes sense.Its also quite easy for a user of dimensioned to make their own type aliases so Im not sure it matters all that much what they are.

Now Im assuming that this breaking change does not adhere to the definition that the Rust project uses for breaking change and stability. Thats the impression that Ive gotten from N. Matsakis.If you are going to introduce a change that are  by your own standards  a breaking change just treat it as such. In the case of SemVer it means bumping to ... That might be unconvenient for Rusts PR but it is honest.gt As someone who has been using Rust for  years... your whining about maybe but probably not having to add a in a few places in your code and how nobody would ever write serious code in this language... its just laughable.People that try to use something after it has become stable for some defined value of stable feel entitled to that promise being upheld or at least is tried to be upheld. Thats the whole point of being a late adopter you have to skip out on the fun early days but you get to come to a relatively tidy house. Early adopters dont get to complain about the fact that late adopters have higher standards are spoiled or whatever.gt When people exhibit sphexish devotion to rules and they steer discussion away from the practical consequences or lack thereof... thats super creepy.Creepy is a weird word to use. Anyway why use something like SemVer if you are going to place loose and fast with what it even means? Why not just use something like X.X where the most significant digit is major release and the least significant is minor release. And leave each of those up to interpretation. Did some external force force Rust to use SemVer or another versioning that is kind of strict?To me it looks like the rules are being reinterpreted when it is convenient for Rust to do so for whatever reason  here I guess for public relation reasons lets not let people think we are breaking compatibility again in a strict sense.

4578254,0,t1_ct7oe1g,The events function returns an iterator you do not have to use it in a for loop. It is an instance of a struct and you can manually call .next on it then match on the resulted event and process it. When you encounter an element that should be processed by a lower level function e.g parsing the tile just pass a reference of the iterator object to that next function. This way the next parser function can continue parsing at the same event because it uses the same iterator object. When that lower level parser is done it just returns and the caller can continue the iteration over the very same iterator like nothing happened. Just try it and youll see that it is not that complicated.,rust,ct7p0q4,3,t5_2s7lj

The actual signature looks like    impl Fromltmyretortgt for MyErrThe corresponding C type is basically a number used as a generic return type to signal various kinds of success or failure values. Successes are always gt  usually  and errors are always lt . In my idiomatic Rust binding this return value is actually replaced with a typedef like type MyRetortltTgt  ResultltT MyErrgt where success values are the ResultOk variant and error values are the ResultErr variant.This cleans up an awful lot of signatures in the corresponding C library which normally return a myretort and initialize some other value in the success case via an out parameter in my bindings those functions just return a MyRetortltWhatevergt. ,rust,ctojozo,1,t5_2s7lj

We hold a list of the slots that are used by the draw call so that we dont erase a slot by mistake.

5844166,0,t1_cxll2mz,If Rust does not make JSON and other data formats ergonomic then Rust will never gain broad adoption in the corporate space. A lot of programming that programmers get paid to do is mundane data shuttlingi.e. the moving around of data from one machine to another from one format into another into and out of a database and finally to a computer screen or report somewhere.In my experience this is true even of C corporate programming. A lot of C shops do systems programmingdrivers embedded lowlevel and performance critical codeonly in isolated spots with the lions share of the code base instead merely shuttling data around. C makes data shuttling verbose and error prone and so far Rust isnt a whole lot better.But Rust has a beautiful trait system that could make data shuttling fun and easyit just needs to standardize on one trait for encoding and one trait for decoding. Currently the field is fragmentedi.e. serdeSerialize and rustcserializeEncodableand libraries must either  choose to support either serde or rustcserialize or else  use compiletime features or some other hack to clumsily support both traits. Whereas if say serde supported both traits then the fragmentation wouldnt exist and the Rust ecosystem go move forward with only the serdeSerialize and Deserialize trait.This is a big opportunity for Rust. C doesnt make data shuttling easy but its moving in that direction. Projects like Casablanca are inching towards production quality foreshadowing Cs embrace of the Web and the C language standard is moving towards features such as stackless coroutines and reflection that will among other benefits make data shuttling a lot easier. But C moves at glacial speeds encumbered by legacy baggage and this means Rust has an opportunity to leap ahead and be the first language to unify sexy systems programming with mundane data shuttling.,rust,cxlp39n,1,t5_2s7lj

They aggressively reuse registers and stack slots. Consequently tracings GCs see no references determine that the heap allocated block is unreachable and can collect it before the end of scope sometimes long before.gt In markandsweep systems at unpredictable intervals all program execution is halted while the GC cleans up the memory.That hasnt been true since Dijkstra invented his onthefly collector in . Today no production GCs are stoptheworld.EDIT Just to clarify production GCs like .NET and JVM do have stoptheworld phases but they do not stop the world while the GC cleans up the memory. They are called mostly concurrent collectors. What this article describes is called a stoptheworld collector.gt The Python version takes almost three times as much real time as the C version. While not all of that difference can be attributed to garbage collection its still considerable.Sorry but trying to blame GC for the difference in milliseconds between C and Python reading a line file is ridiculous.Look at Googles Loop Recognition benchmark for example. Idiomatic F beats idiomatic C despite it being garbage collected.gt Compare this to referencecounting garbage collectionWhy RC and not something more efficient or common like generational GC? I dont think the theoretical comparison is worth trying to do because it is just too hairy. How do you account for the improvement in cache locality due to the compaction of survivors for example? Or the overhead of having to reload references across GC safe points in case object have been moved?gt Consequently there was an explosion of garbagecollected languages in the s designed to make life more pleasant for the programmer even at the expense of performance.All PLs are designed to make life more pleasant for the programmer at the expense of performance.

6544857,0,t1_czw2s6d,I hear what youre saying here and I agree that theres a degree to which a programming community need not turn every thread and every topic into a teachable moment concerning systemic oppression. I would hope it doesnt have to come up often. I only dive into these topics when it is topical when someone seemingly inevitably asks to remove the CoC because were all adults and dont need it.However .. I didnt write that particular passage youre highlighting and I have a little more experience from my time at Mozilla about how people tend to IMO misuse Codes of Conduct in practice they tend to be subject to false equivalences to use them to reinforce marginalization by making equivalences between say discussing gender in a way that makes genderprivileged individuals uncomfortable and sexism. Conversations emerge claiming reverse sexism or reverse racism and such. So to the extent that what youre saying here implies accepting such equivalences and neutralizing entire topics I want to push back against that part of it.People with marginalized identities merely admitting  selfidentifying as such does not constitute flirting with offensive or sensitive issues nor does asserting a right to exist unharassed nor does insisting on an acknowledgement that such marginalization is a major issue of major historical and contemporary significance in the life of the person.It is not the Rust communitys job to solve say racism or sexism or classism but it is its job to accept that a person with say a marginalized racial gender class or similar identity has such an identity if they choose to disclose it and to accept that they may experience disproportionate consequences for that identity. Being white in America say is mostly an ignorable detail in a white persons life because it exists as a default setting in a whitesupremacist culture being black is much less an ignorable detail in a black Americans life and requiring them to not talk about it is a form of reinforcing the bias. They are not equivalent racial states of existence in terms of power and privilege. Making false equivalences between a form of oppression and inverse feelings of discomfort reinforces the oppression by trivializing it.Put yet another way its not ok to tell someone dont discuss that thats too sensitive an issue when they say theyre poor or black or female or gay ... or mention the disproportionate hardship this fact brings to their life. Demanding someone be silent about oppression doesnt make it easier for them let the person affected by such oppression signal their desire or lack thereof to disclose or discuss the fact. Preemptively erasing peoples experience of marginalization in the name of neutrality or topicality is not exercising a sufficient level of empathy and acknowledgement to people with such identities.If you disagree with this assertion on my part  again I didnt write that section of the code and I wouldnt have put it that way and Im not on the moderation team currently  please say as much. Id appreciate a communityteam moderator weighing in here too andor clarification to the CoC on this point.

6893562,0,t3_4a5fco,Hm I dont think Ive heard of the Wire app before.Im curious how they are doing OffTheRecord encryption while also supporting group messages. As far as I know its still a fairly open question with proposals like mpOTR being little more than research papers and no one implementing it not even Signal.Theres also the problem of forwardingstoring the messages on rd party servers for offline peers having a rd party STUN server for WebRTC and that being based in Switzerland is actually completely meaningless and give no stronger guaranteed than any other country.,rust,d0xpbvu,6,t5_2s7lj
6908754,0,t1_d0zctl9,Like what? Im happy to field proposals. Id even be willing to look at other implementations. Do you know of other featureful regex engines that operate on streams?The fundamental problem is that constant time indexing ends up being pretty important. A Iteratorltchargt also means that a whole class of optimizations arent available such as memchr. The DFA also needs to be able to run backwards on the input.I looked into this a few years ago and this was my conclusion I think requiring ampstr or ampu is a very reasonable constraint. I dont think Id call it inflexible. If the text you want to search is too big to fit into memory you can. Use memory maps where the OS will handle whats actually in memory. This is now trivial thanks to bytesRegex.. Divide your search text up into chunks and run the regex on each. Your problem here is if you care about really long matches or matches that cross chunk boundaries. You might be able to solve that by choosing chunks in a clever way e.g. line by line. If that still doesnt solve your problem then I think youre safely in niche territory and should explore solutions other than regex.

Thats not really going to happen MIR doesnt really represent any kind of idiomatic code that you would write. Are you hoping to target more platforms that LLVM doesnt yet support? How many platforms are really of interest and dont already have work in progress to support them? The two that I can think of that Ive heard any interest about recently are AVR and asm.jsWebAssembly but theres already some work in progress for those so it seems like it would be easier to just finish up those efforts rather than entirely replacing the LLVM backend with a C backend.In the abstract sure its possible to compile from MIR to C it would also be possible to compile from HIR to C or directly from Rust to C if you put enough effort into it. C is a Turing complete language you can always do it somehow. But just because you can do it doesnt mean the result would actually be useful and describing how feasible it is to produce a useful result will depend on why you are interested in doing it.So why is it that you dream of a Rust to C compiler?,rust,d2ogugl,7,t5_2s7lj

8276922,0,t3_4suaml,I just published version .. on crates.io This is a side project I have been working on in my spare time for quite some time. Its progressing slowly but you can already play around with it. At the moment this library provides mostly one thing a path tessellator which takes an svglike complex path as parameter and outputs a list of triangles that you can use with your own rendering engine. The rust logo intersecting a rectangle to test the evenodd svg fill rule in the project page on github is rendered using the tessellator and you can run the example program to see it happen on your own screen.It is still in an early stage. There are bugs and a ton of missing features but I would be happy to team up if there are graphics enthusiasts interested around here. I have put together a few wiki pages with some notes about contributing  a list of things to do  and the beginning of an explanation of the tessellation algorithm .Sadly I just found out I missspelled the words tessellator and tessellation everywhere.

8474651,0,t1_d60uw1a,gt As far as intrinsics go I think we probably want a broader story there. Theres a lot more than just the CRC instruction and Im not sure doing it piecemeal will fly.People just implement the intrinsics that they need e.g. Huon for his SIMD crate me for my bit manipulation crates... In the last discussion the consensus seemed to be strongly against going overboard with adding to many intrinsics without practical justification we really need this for doing X otherwise we are Y times slower. Basically everybody was in favor of evaluating them in an individual basis. In particular LLVM does removeaddrename intrinsic between releases freely so we want to make sure that we at least have fallback implementations at least for those that might get removed.gt  It is immensely unsatisfying given the weirdness of actually enabling targetfeature and the fact that its nightly onlyCurrently one can expose intrinsics without adding them to the standard library first. This kinds of allow us to add intrinsics to nightly wrap them in a crate that also provides a portable implementation and then prove that the crate is useful before adding them to standard. It is not instantly rewarding but I think it is a good way to do it.I mean if the intrinsic is really worth it at that point the RFC boils down to this is implemented useful used lets remove the x slowdown in stable.,rust,d60vfj0,1,t5_2s7lj

DThanks for your explanation of writeall. I will fix it after I understand how my code should work.Suppose I receive a long message and read the first bytes into the buffer. I try to write them to back to the TcpStream but it would block. So I return TickWouldBlock and store how many bytes wait to be written. Since there are more bytes in the TcpStream will tokio call tick again or does it know that I want to write some bytes and wait until the stream is writable? In the first case am I expected to always read all bytes from the stream?gt They are actually slightly different. The implementation directly on TcpStream takes ampself where as the one for ioRead and ioWrite takes ampmut self.I find this interesting. With ioRead and ioWrite taking ampmut self only one can write or read the stream because of the ownership and borrowing rules. If read and write are ampself is it possible to do parallel reads and writes? And doesnt it may cause garbled output if multiple tasks write to a stream at the same time?gt Regarding DNS lookup this is a high priorityOh I missed that ToSocketAddrs may do DNS lookup. On a HTTP server I usually do not need it but I would like to have the comfort of automatic conversion to socket addresses. ,rust,d6t0q8h,1,t5_2s7lj

9065557,0,t1_d81icfm,Where is the Easy type from? Also thats what I thought. writefunction forces a certain lifetime upon your closure that you cant guarantee here. Its probably either the easys lifetime or static. If its static you need some kind of smart pointer like Rc which allows you to share ownership of the result or maybe a channel  promise  future to send the result once its available. It really depends on what the Easy type and its methods actually do. If the lifetime of your closure is just bound to the lifetime of the easy binding you can easily just enclose the whole thing in a block and do your return outside of that block so that the easy binding goes out of scope and the result binding outlives it.,rust,d81j7q4,1,t5_2s7lj
9089518,0,t1_d84dt7i,Yes. All pointers including the this or self pointer are owned and garbage collected in managed languages like Java or C. So in this case in a managed language the this pointers would keep c alive until the call chain unwound at which point b and c could be garbage collected safely.Thats the tradeoff that you traditionally make between managed languages with garbage collection and systems languages with unmanaged pointers in managed languages everything is GCd while in systems languages that have unmanaged pointers you can easily make a mistake that winds up chasing a dangling pointer and get undefined behavior.Thats the main benefit that Rusts borrow checker gives you. It allows you to use references which are lighter weight than GCd pointers couple with various different types of owned pointers Box vs. Rc vs. Arc or just owned unboxed stack allocated values while ensuring safety. Of course not everything can be represented with just a single type of owned pointers and borrows so Rust gives you the ability to use unsafe but provide a safe abstraction which is what Box Rc Arc and so on all do internally.And thats similar to what Herb Sutter is doing here with deferredptr providing a safer abstraction for pointers that can form arbitrary graphs though since its implemented in C you cant actually provide that safe abstraction boundary that Rust can provide you do still have to rely on the programmer to get it right in a way that the compiler cant check.,rust,d84ew59,3,t5_2s7lj

9155635,0,t1_d8ch70x,Im not sure I totally understand your question. You can use let more than once for the same variable just like you have in your example there. Take a look The key difference between using let multiple times vs doing regular assignment with a mut variable is that let is shadowing the original rather than changing it. You can see that by taking references before you shadow and seeing that the value behind them doesnt change In fact one of Rusts most important guarantees is that the value behind a reference will never change out from under it. At least in the case of plainolddata. Things get more interesting with Cell etc. If you tried to do the same thing with a mut variable thats a compiler error ,rust,d8cjk1z,6,t5_2s7lj
9199377,0,t1_d8i0x5u,Ok so theyre not the same kind of thing... Again thats too abstract for me to see how its relevant.What relation does that distinction have to something that can actually be implemented in any kind of syntax that an existing compiler can check?As far as the Rust compiler is concerned if the read transition function takes ownership of the original FileLikeThingltOpengt and returns String FileLikeThingltOpengt Ill be invalidating the parent stack frames reference to the old FileLikeThingltOpengt and returning a tuple of two things one of which can take over the role the old FileLikeThingltOpengt used to serve.The state machine behaviour would come about as a sideeffect of how Rust handles ownership and impl and the compiler wouldnt care that theyre different kinds of things... theyre just instances with lifetimes and traits.Sure itd be nice to do it properly but I have no idea how one would enforce correct usage at compile time without that invalidate and return replacement pattern. Asis it feels as if you are arguing for tail recursion in a language which doesnt optimize it simply because programming with mutable state is undesirable.,rust,d8i37h5,3,t5_2s7lj

9390005,0,t1_d962uh9,Im fuzzy on the specifics but the reasoning is something around the token sequence A lt B gt ... being ambiguous without additional context and possibly unbounded lookahead during parsing. But IIRC Rust wants to maintain LALR parsing. The lt sequence basically says what follows is definitely a type and that allows faster parsing compared to seeing lt and needing to determine if B is a type or an expression which requires more information. Its not that its impossible to get the syntax you suggest  it just introduces substantial complexity into the compiler.If you need a unifying intuition it might help to think of  not as a module separator but as a scoping operator where scope is a little fuzzier than the scope of a variable. Normally you might see it as Tnew which calls fn new within the scope of T. Seeing lt sort of instructs the compiler that its now in type parsing scope.

Although in that case ampFooltTgt would not invoke drop and would be ok.  But the compiler writers reserve the right to to change struct layout.You should at least throw in    fn fooifylta Tgtb ampa T gt ampa FooltTgt         let ptr  b as const  as const FooltTgt        unsafe              asserteq!b as const T ampptr. as const T            ampptr            Edit Or use    reprC    struct FooltTgtTWhich has a well defined size and layout.,rust,d9dm1kz,3,t5_2s7lj

However...    implltagt ModifierltResponsegt for ampa str    impl ModifierltResponsegt for Status    impl ModifierltResponsegt for Vecltugt    ...gtThis is really just regularass dynamic dispatch except backwards so its the variant type that determines what the hell is going on not the type being affected. So we can rewrite the above code asThe resulting code will actually use static dispatch and its the type implementing Modifier that determines what is actually going on.  Just looking at it my guess is that str and Vecltugt impls modify the response body and Status impl will modify the response status.The tuple implementations are pretty clever too.  You should be able to rewrite your example as follows    let mut r  ResponsewithstatusOk renderedmarkdown    OkrIts almost too clever to the point where its not at all intuitive.

Caller activated them and passed a return address and a yield address callee jumped back to whichever one it wanted control pingponged back and forth between the two until complete.They also permitted tailyielding from a caller into an iterator i.e. replacing current frame w an iterator that runs to completion then returns to your caller.This was made significantly more complicated by the typestate system so there wound up being multiple protocols for calling iterators depending on whether the callee was guaranteed to yield   or N times you get different control flow graphs in the caller loop depending.

9712231,0,t1_daa3ir2,A transfer of ownership always involves some level of copying though it may just be copying a pointer and may involve setting a marker so that it wont be accessed if there is no way to statically determine that it wont be accessed. To list a few examples Transferring ownership of a Handle into a vector and then back out again     A handle is four bytes in size.    struct Handleu     Construct the handle.     This will involve a stack allocation of four bytes.    let h  Handle     Construct the vector.     This involves a stack allocation of three pointers in size.    let mut v  Vecnew     Transfers ownership of the handle from the h variable to the vector.     This will involve copying the data from the stack to the vectors heap allocation.     The stack slot is not written over by a default value     and in this example there is no sidecar flag either     but if I tried to access h I would get a compiletime error.     h is no longer considered initialized.     It also involves incrementing the vecs length member     and potentially adjusting the capacity and heap allocating     in this case it will because the capacity is  right now.    v.pushh     This would not compile if it was uncommented.    println! h.     This will and itll print .     It will perform a bounds check on the array     to make sure that a value actually exists there.    println! ampv.     Transfer ownership from v to k.     In this case the transfer of ownership is performed by a copy     and decrementing the length of the vec.    let k  v.pop     This will compile and will print .    println! k.     This still wont compile.    println! h.     This will compile but will cause the program to crash.     The bounds check fails. The memory formerly occupied by     the handle is no longer considered initialized.     Ideally it wouldnt compile but halting problem.    println! ampv.     Transfer ownership from k to m.     In this case its just a copy. Nothing else happens at runtime.    let m  k     This wont compile. k is no longer considered initialized.    println! k.     This prints .    println! m.,rust,daa8pxf,6,t5_2s7lj

9786451,0,t3_5f9zc4,Ive added many features to Titanium a webkitbased keyboarddriven web browser sorry if some of these features are the same of a previous post its been a long time    Added settings including webkit settings.  Added support for search engines.  Started the download manager with file completion to select where to download the file the user can also choose to open the file instead of downloading it.  Added the possibility to follow a link in a new window or to simulate hover on a link the latter is not always working.  Added some commands like copypaste URLs clear cache delete cookies print   Added support for bookmarks with tags I started this as a YAML file but I switch to SQLite to avoid synclocking issues. The user can search bookmarks by tag in the open and winopen commands by prefixing tags by . For instance the input rust book will search for bookmarks with a rust tag where the title or the url contains the word book.  Started a loginpassword form filler with autosubmit. I currently use a YAML file with a setting to store the passwords with the pass password manager but I think I will switch to gnome keyring. Do you think I should keep the three ways to store the passwords or only use gnome keyring? Ive looked at the keepass crate but it was too slow.  I added tests for the login form filler feature because it is somewhat hard to do it right.  Added an currently mandatory adblocker.  Show the link in the status bar when the mouse hover a link how would you do that without the mouse? with a hint shortcut?.  Added support for ctrlclick to open a link in a new window.  Switch to use an unsafe connect! macro to avoid having many RefCells and Cells. While this change allowed me to improve the code thanks to the compiler this can cause segfaults if it is used in the wrong way. Does anybody know how I can change this macro to make sure that the target of the event lives at least as long as the source? I tried adding a dummyempty function with the right lifetime annotations but it was not flexible enought for this project because I would need HKT to be generic over the pointer types.  Many UI and nonUI fixes.I wont work too much on this project this week because I will be busy but the next thing Ill do is to add the gnome keyring backend for the login form filler and improve the login form filler so that it works with more login forms.This web browser starts to become usable so even thought it is in a very early stage I encourage you to try it.

10043248,0,t1_dbgmziv,Id like to offer a different opinion. When I rig for example Sublime Text with my own build script cf.   its trivial to make it run some code with every build. My typical worflow is making a unit test configuring the build system to run it on CtrlB then writing code and seeing how it works with but a single keystroke without ever leaving the editor. This writerun cycle is Id wager not very different from a REPL.Another point is the borrow checker. A lot of people focus on writing superfast code in Rust a code that avoid allocations and borrows. But if you shift your focus a bit and allow yourself to use the ownedrefcounted structures more often the borrowchecker becomes a nonissue. Rust isnt any worse than most other languages when prototyping in that mode and the result is still faster than most interpreted languages and on par with modern C style which uses refcounted structs and owned strings too.Prototyping with an interpreted language works for a lot of people but in my experience Rust can be used for prototyping and exploratory programming as well.

I think the API should either provide such a function or return a Result.Also it is very surprising that the output is written at the end of the buffer. I guess its because you compute and write the last digit first and you dont know how long the output will be so you have no choice but start from the rightmost position.

10393024,0,t1_dclzzs3,Well yes butGo doesnt ask you to care about epoll. You dont need syscall or any third party packages to write a server that handles thousands of concurrent connections.You do whatever starting goroutines as appropriate and any given goroutine will eventually block on something. If its waiting for a channel the runtime suspends it contextswitches the OS thread to another goroutine and eventually resumes when the channel is ready. If its waiting for a file descriptor the runtime suspends it does something else and eventually resumes back once the file descriptor did something. You dont call epoll yourself  the runtime does it for you.This is a core language feature so every library works the same way everything shares the same scheduler same event loop etc. You write code that runs in a straight line and the runtime uses epoll on Linux kqueue on BSD event ports on Solaris and IO completion ports on Windows and it works even though those last two are rather different.Of course all this also increases Gos surface area with the platform. Go wont work without its scheduler without control of its event loop without control of its threads without its garbage collector etc. Rust doesnt make these same assumptions.,rust,dcm45x7,8,t5_2s7lj

Fix the next error. Repeat. Occasionally cheat by running ripgrep and trying to fix a bunch manually.The reason Rust refactoring is still fast for me is because once it goes green again Im almost  certain that it works perfectly even before unit tests run. With a  line Rails or JavaScript app written by somebody else I know that its going to be subtly broken after socalled refactoring. And that means that its probably going to need to go back to the testers for careful manual testing especially if its a JavaScript app with tricky UI stuff like drag amp drop going on.Dont get me wrong I love TypeScript refactoring even though its not quite as safe as Rust refactoring because of occasional weird holes in what the TypeScript compiler checks.

Quite seriously you can end up with it being trivial to write a correct application using something but very difficult to maintain a library with it.Think about things like serde its delightfully easy to use the normal way but if your needs are more complex it can be fairly hard to get it to do what you need potentially requiring a fairly detailed understanding of traits generics associated types and a few other things.Like most things its a tradeoff. Also you have to be careful with respect to marketing.

This means that Option Result and IIRC Iter are all examples of monads in Rust because they all allow you to apply functions to the values that they contain without having to explicitly extract it from the structure and put it back. The power of monads comes from the fact that this mapping operation can have more logic than just directly applying your function to the value. In the simplest case of OptionltTgt we can map a function from T to some other type U that can assume that its parameter is a valid T and this is safe because if our Option is actually None... the function just doesnt get called and the map call directly returns another None. Except this time its typed as an OptionltUgt to make the signature of map consistent For a slightly more complicated example which IIRC is still dependent on monads then because of the fact that Option is iterable then if you have an IterltOptionltTgtgt you can do a flatmap|T| T i.e. mapping the identity function to produce an IterltTgt of all of the Some values in the original iterator.,rust,dejdauw,-1,t5_2s7lj

11118665,0,t1_denfzib,gt All you really need are two unbounded incrementordecrementors with an is zero output each and a FSMFTFYAlbeit with doubleexponential slowdown!One of my favorite unexpectedly Turingcomplete systems.With two counters you can check the modulus K of one of the two counters nondestructively for any fixed K by allocating one state for each ..K where each state decrements the counter amp increments the other counter. Adding a fixed number is trivial. Multiplying and dividing by any fixed number are also doable.With two counters you can emulate K counters by storing abc... To check if a counter K is zero see if the counter mod PK the Kth prime is zero. To increment a counter K multiply by PK to decrement divide by PK.With  counters or  if youre willing to juggle you can emulate two stacks using a similar trick  treat the value in the counter as a base S number where S is the number of symbols. To push multiply by S and add the new number. To pop divide by S and keep track of the remainder.And then with  stacks you can emulate a classic Turing Machine as you mention.,rust,desair9,2,t5_2s7lj

11251717,0,t3_60l4ky, open issues does indeed feel like a lot but its still manageable and on the lowerend of what youll find in opensource bug trackers GCC has tens of thousands of open bugs Firefox has had millions of bugs filed etc. The most important thing to keep in mind is to note and track highpriority bugs as they come in which we do with the Phigh etc. tags. That said we love having help with triage theres a triage meeting every two weeks that is attended by every paid Rust developer and this is open to the public. Find the dates for the next meeting here  . As a point of history we had almost exactly  open bugs when Rust . came out so weve added a net of  bugs in the past two years.Having  open pull requests at a given time is par for the course for Rust. If this number were growing it would be a worry but its been quite stable for the past few years. open RFCs isnt a concern because anyone can open an RFC for anything at all. The individual subteams decide which RFCs take priority to visit and discuss based upon community feedback. Every week each subteam discusses some their assigned RFCs and tries to move them forward. The language can only absorb so much change at a time so theres no desire from anyone to reach inboxzero on the RFC tracker.Only  nightly features waiting to get stabilized? Thats an improvement. P Rust . was basically the Death Star from Return of the Jedi fully armed and operational but none of the tiling is done in any of the bathrooms and sometimes when you go to flush you just get sucked out into space. The language is making good progress here so Im not concerned.As for  its a common fallacy to point to ancient unaddressed issues in bug trackers and use that as some sort of proxy for deficiency in development. Lowpriority bugs are lowpriority and it would be an inefficient use of resources to focus on tackling bugs by age alone.That said if anyone would like to volunteer were always happy to mentor new developers.  Find the Rust developers at internals.rustlang.org and in rustinternals on irc.mozilla.org.Im personally most interested in reducing the issue backlog. A long time ago we had a service that would randomly select a few open bugs a week and email them to interested users for casual triage and that worked well for a good bit. Might be worth bringing it back... although the problem is that many bugs require acknowledgement from the original bug author that a fix has actually fixed something and thats a brick wall for casual triage.,rust,df7d636,61,t5_2s7lj

In fact we did a ton of work on this from the high level API side in order to ship browser.html last year and its no surprise the browser.html team has been doing more work on designing APIs at the lower level as well.Its true we dont give the current implementation like the CEF API implementation high priority but mostly that is a function of having no users. We do however spend quite a bit of time trying to figure out which applications could make use of this and trying to push on those. We also tend to prioritize platform features that app designers who wish to use embedded Servo would need which is why one of this years team goals is to get Google Docs running well.As for basic browsing needing to work that is only true in some of the embedding use cases. I think we have enough things working now that for nonwebbrowser applications ie chat client similar to irccloud or slack could be written on the platform though you are right that we need to make some facilities more ergonomic.

Edit see my comment later in this chain for the semantics here.The second argument is the item the attribute was applied to so if you had     actorimpl    impl Foo         fn dothinga u     You would get impl Foo  fn dothinga u  Then I would use syn with the full feature so that it provides parseitem You can just .unwrap the result as panics in proc macros will get turned into errors that are reported at the invocation site. If you have it parse this input youll get a synItem with node ItemKindImplItem I recommend deeply exploring the syn docs to see how it handles the Rust AST its a relatively faithful reproduction of Rusts internal AST representation.After youve gathered the information you need to construct the types and impls you want you can use the quote crate to produce your output TokenStream with the new items you can emit anything from your procedural macro.

11781910,0,t1_dgugvv2,First off my article mentions these are artificial responses and my writing style is that of dry humor. Not everyone will appreciate that and that is totally fine.  With that said however there are some cold hard truths to what I posted. That means that this article was written for anyone who wants to learn more about rust why it exists and why it can have a steep learning curve. In other words this article was written for anyone who takes the time to read it.,rust,dgvin3o,1,t5_2s7lj

Certainly rewriting everything from scratch would be silly and it was wrong of me to imply that was the only choice.That said theres still the cost which is my sticking point. Soon as Rust is in the stack I need most of my engineers to be competent Rust developers. That retraining cost the political cost and the tooling cost getting the build system CI etc. handling it is an issue.Id need to see justification that writing one new component or whatever in Rust actually brings some kind of measurable productivity speed or other improvement over the same bit in C. I just dont ever see that happening in the clientside engine itself for all the same reasons that we havent replaced C with whatever other New Language Hotnesstm is out there. Or more accurately I should say that the studio has tried that in the past and been bitten. gt gtAgain youre pretending all C is crap and all Rust is perfect. That isnt reality.gt Sorry that it came out that way. If I had more time I would have tried harder to make it come differently.No worries. Communicating in textReddit is hard to do while representing your true personality or opinions. I myself tend to be fairly hyperbolic when communicating in text I apologize for that and hope it isnt confusing my messages too much. gt But the more I program in both Rust and C the more I get an I wish had used Rust for this as well when I hit some rough edges of C. The same is true about Rust though.Yeah thats my experience. Which goes back to why I prefer evolution over revolution  Id rather fix the problems in an existing stack than throw it out and redesign it from scratch.This is one of the reasons I try to work with the C committee. Id rather see C evolve into a better language by learning the lessons that Rust and other modern languages like Swift or Nim or even modern managed languages like C or Scala or whatnot are teaching the wider developer community. Just making the company jump onto the new tech toy train every  months is a recipe for disaster. Its kind of like weighing the decisions between a developer who wants to rewrite a core system they dont like or the one who wants to refactor and fix up the major problems in said system sometimes rewriting absolutely is the right answer but more often the refactor is a better longterm play. C can never be perfect  and unfortunately neither can Rust  but it can certainly be better. Maybe Im misjudging the costbenefit analysis here given the glacially slow pace of C evolution but it still feels like a better path forward to me than replacing our engine  or even portions of it  with a new language.Again though Im all for Rust on the server going forward... if thats what the company standardizes on for their server tech. Its not like were even using all that much C throughout the server stack at most companies in the first place sthe comparison of Rust vs existing tech is different there since were often comparing it with managed languages dynamicallytypes languages or far out languages that only a fraction of my engineers are reasonably competent using I find the case for a safe unmanaged highperformance language like Rust a lot easier when comparing it to Java or Python or the like but thats me. One server tech stack I have worked with had large chunks of it in Erlang other big chunks in Java a strong dose of Python a number of pieces in JavaScript and newer bits in TypeScript and a collection of other languages tossed in here or there just a wildwest tech stack. Those kinds of environments are where I saw the most obvious and strongest evidence of why using weird languages or mixing in hot new tech to an existing stack is problematic its darn near impossible to find anyone who can actually work on the entire stack or even  of it without ridiculously long rampup times. Just standing up a cluster of all services was mindbogglingly complex and essentially impossible without automation and while the puppet scripts and whatnot existed you had to have conference calls with  engineers to be able to get answers to why the components were doing X or Y because no one person could keep it all in their head. It was a nightmare. Which is why wise companies standardize their entire stack whether were talking Web companies or game companies or whatever on a small handful of contemporary nonsexy tech pieces like Java or C and stick with it even when those choices are a little painful and when the hew hotness like Rust or whatnot promises to fix many of those pain points.In the near future nonsexy contemporary tech will include Rust so I definitely see it being in the mix. I seriously hope that in my next job should I be working on a new server stack we pick Rust as our workhorse. ,rust,dgwzsli,3,t5_2s7lj
