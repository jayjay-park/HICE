5084944,0,t1_cuwytfi,Id be really surprised if there was a DoW that TPang had missed! Personally I think its more likely that our damaged units sustained their injuries from American units who have since diedmoved offscreen or that our damaged units just got hurt a few turns before and have moved away from the site of the fight. Remember that we DoWed on turn  and the mysterious injuries you point out are seen ten whole turns later.,reykjaviktory,cuyxg3j,1,t5_39if8
5095474,0,t1_cv05arm,Luckily it doesnt really matter for us right now. Until they get Galleass tech our naval skirmishes will be technologically even.I dont see us taking any further cities but its not impossible the AI will derp and give us a city.EDIT Besides America is only up  techs on us. This will NOT be a problem for the current war. Looking at the tech tree they most likely went for Guilds I havent seen any American pikemen and I believe their AI has a tendency for gold buildings which means that their Galleases are still a long ways off. Also of note is that Canada is between  and  techs ahead but they have pikes. Could be very scary if they use their carpet but hopefully their peaceloving AI holds them back while we recuperate.EDIT  Ireland just entered the Medieval Era. With their navy and relatively high warmongering AI this could definitely be concerning. With luck England will be seen as a greater immediate threat and the two will use up their armies against each other.,reykjaviktory,cv071hp,2,t5_39if8
