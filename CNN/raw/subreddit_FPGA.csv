205410,0,t1_cf1lc3b,Thanks  I have gone through some of the mojo tutorials however their projects are demoed with verilog rather than vhdl.I had done some of the nandtetris projects with their simulators a year or so ago.  i have since forgotten how they work and have to relearn so this time I thought Id try it on an fpga at around the same time Im doing it in the simulator.What are the added issues  difficulties doing it on an fpga would cause?Thanks again.,FPGA,cf1u8ub,1,t5_2sf3o

It takes a bit of work but most of the time you dont need floating point arithmetic.Synthesizing a fp math core will always be expensive it should be a last resort.edit I see that you were looking at fixed point as well.

1745732,0,t1_cjz6lzk,Think of verilog as a certain subset of systemverilog that actually translates directly into real hardware. Thats what synthesizable means that the code can be converted into hardware. If you restrict yourself to the parts of the language that have hardware analogues you will have a design that you can put on your FPGA or even convert into a real IC.The extra language features of systemverilog are helpful but they are only meant for making sure the synthesizable parts are correct. If hardware is your goal these parts will get left out or worse get turned into extremely ugly hardware that wont function efficientlyTLDR Write your actual design in systemverilog but only use the parts of the language that are synthesizable. Use the other parts of the language to test the design.,FPGA,cjz7kui,1,t5_2sf3o

2340709,0,t3_2m512r,GALs are tiny. You can barely fit a  series chip on them they have  or so macrocells. The programming pins on them are shared with the signal pins so they use high voltage programming. The coolrunner is more complex hundreds of macrocells and has more pins. In production a device like this would be used as glue logic to connect chips with incompatible interfaces. Theyre not complex enough to do anything major. Both chips are CPLDs simple persistently progammable logic chips.The DE uses an FPGA which is orders of magnitudes more complex than a CPLD. They also have specialized hardware blocks such as DSP cores RAM blocks PLLs etc some even have ARM cores. The only downside is that they have no persistent memory the design must be reprogrammed each time the chip powers on. But you can go to town on an FPGA you can implement a processor or even a small SoC put the ROM in one of the memory blocks and use the chips as a micro controller with custom hardware accelerated functions.Perhaps your class delves more into the design of a microcontroller than the programming of one hence why you would need an FPGA.,FPGA,cm10w09,6,t5_2sf3o

6082018,0,t1_cygo33i,Personally I find this line of skepticism unproductive.  So what?  Are you saying because Ive built something primitive everything I build will be primitive?  In your world where do sophisticated projects come from?  Do they pop out fully formed or are dismissed?I disagree that arachne doesnt provide value compared to commercial offerings given the current stage of development.  One user of the IceStorm suite wrote in a bug report which we fixed promptly We would like to do what we can to help fix your tools because the workflow is far superior to Lattice LSE.  Clifford gave benchmarks vs the Lattice SBT backend for implementation placeroute time of a RISCV CPU design that used  of a K arachnepnr is around x faster.  Yes x.  See page  of his recent c presentationArachne was designed to place and route for iCE chips.  I think the algorithm choices are entirely appropriate given their complexity.  What do my basic algorithms stop you from doing on the iCE that you can do with commercial tools?  Seriously tell me so I can fix them.  Is this what Id implement if I were targeting a juicy Altera FPGA?  No of course not.  Arachne clearly demonstrates we can create serious tools for real FPGA architectures.

It has a hard time solving the problems im trying to solve which is communications and various related signal processing tasks.Im pretty biased toward straight VHDL and can get a lot done fast. The other stuff just isnt how I like to solve these problems. It seems like its saving you something but you are really only communicating and addressing the issue through a different more roundabout way.The issue being how does on parallelize this algorithm the necessary amount to implement it efficiently and meet your real time requirements.  HLS you write it once and then spend tons of time adding pragmas to get it to do what you want. OpenCL you dive into the morass of kernels and esoteric C that is nothing if not as complicated or worse than an HDL.

7243258,0,t3_4eg7wj,Dont waste your time with ISE.. its a dead tool fading away.   Vivado is the better choice especially if you will be looking for a job at some point.   Quartus is also good but I understand it will be obsoleted in the near future by the new supertool being designed to support the Stratix  devices.VHDL is a bitch to learn and its cumbersome in spots well many spots.  But ultimately I think its more powerful than Verilog because of the ability to do physical design.   You can implement weird circuits with combinatorial feedback  i.e. RS flip flops  using LUTs using the attribute loophole.   On the downside VHDL is a lot slower to simulate than Verilog and far inferior to SystemVerilog when writing testbenches.    We use both now.. with synthesizeable code written in VHDL and testbenches in SystemVerilog and UVM.      Looking at the Xilinx website it seems they are getting ready to release the . version of Vivado.

From my experience the IDE is setup to be an ideal development environment for someone tinkering on a Xilinx branded development board.

Using tcl scripts to reproduce everything is a sure fire way of exporting your packaged ip cleanly but I need a way of getting back to the specific input that went into a previous build of a product.
