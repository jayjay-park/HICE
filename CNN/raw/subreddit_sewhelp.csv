452714,0,t3_1z8kas,regarding zippered bathing suits... I bought a swimsuit with a real working zipper when I was a teenager.  Be ready for tons of embarrassing moments as the zipper catches in pubes and suddenly it hurts more than anything ever to walk. It also fell open randomly... in front of my boyfriends entire family... exposing that I was dared to dye my pubes purple. My advice is to burn it if you know what youre in for.,sewhelp,cfrq0n6,3,t5_2srbo
641177,0,t3_21hcjf,If your thread is breaking its probably a thread tension problem. Try setting the upper thread tension to the middle of the dial and rethread the machine with the foot up. If this doesnt work slowly move the tension dial and test stitch. If the upper thread tension has to be at a far end of the dial it could be a bobbin tension problem and it may be best to take it in for someone qualified to fix that.,sewhelp,cgd5ht9,1,t5_2srbo

919164,0,t1_ch8pz6l,Honestly? I can not give you any recommendations for those  since I know the singers are not worth it and I can not find any reliable information on the Naumann Machine to know who makes it other then seeing the Singer name next to it on many sites so I would stay away from it also. You may get lucky buying one of those  and have it work great for a few years. I would buy an extended warranty with it so when it breaks  it can get fixedreplaced.  Basically you get what you pay for a cheap machine is just that cheaply made and not built for extended heavy use they are made for  sewing on a button that has fallen off or fixing a hem on a pair of slacks or small crafts projects. If I had a buy a cheap machine It would be a Brother.

Usually the shop will just rethread it and it will work.,sewhelp,chhgojh,7,t5_2srbo
1240383,0,t3_28aods,   There are lots of options but success will depend a little bit on how strong your sewing skills are if youre just starting out I always suggest picking up a pattern thats marked Easy or Beginner or Novice  even a really simple pattern can become something special if you make it over and over and turn it into a bit of an art formAlso if youre into reading blogs to brush up your skills I do recommend Male Pattern BoldnessThe writer makes absolutely amazing clothing and often posts stepbystep construction posts.  If you look fairly low down on the right side of his blog youll see the tags on the posts  one of them is mens shirt and its pretty good reading.,sewhelp,ci95qnw,3,t5_2srbo

2680813,0,t1_cn2am4u,Dont run at full speed while winding the bobbin. It stretches the thread as the thread gets hot from the friction. Youll have problems with your tension. Make sure you are following the directions for machine set up to wind bobbins.

6860124,0,t3_49ptcr,It would help if you posted pictures of your finished items so we could see how exactly they can be improved  Some tips that I can think of make a muslin and test the fit of your pattern before cutting into fashion fabric a wellfitted garment will look a lot better than something that stretches or has folds in unflattering areas.   Make sure to cut your pattern pieces on the grain whenever appropriate so that they hang well.   Press your seams! This will make a world of difference to the finished garment.   Clean seam finishes not necessarily with an overlocker french seams rayon seam binding etc.Apart from practical sewing tips I think the fabric that youre using makes a big difference too in how homely a finished item looks. My suggestions would be to look at RTW stuff that you like and note down what type of fabric was used weight of the fabric etc. ,sewhelp,d0twk76,10,t5_2srbo

9423128,0,t3_59p5u5,I did a total hack for a bed in my dogs crate and he LOVES it. Loves it worlds better than any bed Ive actually put money or effort into for him lolI went to JoAnns and bought a thick piece of foam with one of their  off coupons. Mine was  I believe but the littler the dog the thinner you can go and have it still be squishy for them. I bought it close to size and then trimmed it down to the size of the crate when I got home. If youve already got a pillow that will fit in there or something go ahead and use that. I like the foam because its pretty firm so he doesnt feel the need to dig around at it like he does for looser or fluffier beds. And therefore doesnt destroy it.For a puppy thats still working on the whole where do we pee? concept or for a dog thats outside a lot and frequently muddy or wet yay! Wrap that foam up in a cheap shower curtain. Just wrap it around like a present no need to sewtapepin any excess just do it neatly so all the flappy ends are on the bottom. This way the foam wont get wet and you can just wash or hose off the shower curtain if it gets soiled.I have a fairly large crate so bought  bath towels you can use  if its little and sew up a pillow case. Just a normal open on one end pillow case ie  whole lines of sewing  if youre folding one towel. Now stuff your pillow in there flip the excess end of that pillow case underneath and shove it in the crate.Whenever it gets nasty I just pull it off and wash layers as appropriate. You could use pretty fleece and other nicely patterned fabrics as well though the edges may need to be finished so they dont fray.,sewhelp,d9ag305,3,t5_2srbo

10298289,0,t3_5ngeig,So you will need to replace that zipper. You can start by buying a similar sized nonseparating zipper. YKK if you can find it. Carefully removes the stitching that holds the existing zipper in. Pin the new zipper in place and start to sewing. It is likely that the original zipper was seen as a plaque before the pack was assembled so it could be tight getting the pack under the sewing machine foot. But more than likely not impossible.
