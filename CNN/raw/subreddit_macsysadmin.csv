302729,0,t3_1xie6k,Depends on your environment. For a University Computer lab type scenario network home directories would accomplish this. Fast file servers and networks needed as all home directories will be on the server not local storage. Also needs network authentication such as LDAP Open Directory Active Directory. For more mobile synced network home directories. Similar to network homes except OS X keeps the data local and syncs it to the network home directory. Not a real time sync could easily corrupt the home directory if you logged into multiple Macs at once. Again network accounts needed. If you just want account settings a MDM solution Apple Profile Manager JAMF Casper Suite Absolute Manage others could apply a user level configuration at Logon that has the mail account settings. Kerberize authentication to your mail server and use network logins and it should just work without having a saved password anywhere. Thats every way I can think of at the moment. ,macsysadmin,cfc573o,1,t5_2t01r

3655321,0,t3_326630,for A Im making two assumptions. Your configure script is being installed by a package hence the  but it can be anything passing the Volume along as the rd Argument. This is true for Package scripts.  If its not a package make sure that this is true and  isnt something else.  Its good that youre catching this as its a common error to just assume the package is being installed onto the volume its booted off of. I know of several products that didnt do this and I had to write them email and complain.   I think Adobe might still get this one wrong they used to.. Your Volume name has a space in it.  i.e. Macintosh HD.The solution is to properly quotedefaults write LibraryPreferences.... SoftwareRepoURL URLmunkirepoIf you dont it shell expands to defaults write VolumesMacintosh HDLibraryPreferences.... SoftwareRepoURL URLmunkirepoThat breaks as defaults is being passed VolumesMacintosh and HDLibraryPreferences.... SoftwareRepoURL URLmunkirepo.  It needs to be seen as defaults write VolumesMacintosh HDLibraryPreferences.... SoftwareRepoURL URLmunkirepo or VolumesMacintosh HD...When you type it on the command line youre on the root volume so youre not using the Volume name and even if you are youre probably just automatically shell expandingescaping the space.Also read varlogsystem.log for any errors installing the package try installing the package manually and seeing if there are an errors logged your script.  I like to manually run some of my prepost install scripts to ensure I didnt make a stupid syntax error.  Hm probably a good simple shell script that I never wrote one that sets up the right environment all the args passed to a package script and then runs the script. It helps debug so many problem like this.   It is weird to put yourself in to the artificial shell environment that runs during install andor boot.Lastly its generally a good practice to use full paths to commands in installer scripts and scripts that run early in a boot environment.   usrbindefaults instead of defaults.  This is more of the the environment that the script is going to run in.  You dont always know the PATH that is going to be set in some places that might not include anything... though general usrbin is included.  But its not those that will kill you itll be something that is in usrlocalbin and that is in a users path by default but not in some system level environments and then you wonder why a script isnt working.This is why you see a lot of Shell scripts that start out doing things like DEFAULTSusrbindefaultsDEFAULTS write.....In this case this is likely not the case but its just good script hygiene to be fully pedantic and it also removes any possibility of ambiguity.  Any script that is being run with elevated permissions should always spell out exactly which command it wants to run.  Think about fun with PATH and putting bin before usrbin and then dropping lscd etc commands in there.  If you always call binls in a script that might run as root via sudo or some other method you dont have that problem. Its a bit of paranoia but its still good practice.Not sure what is going on with B.  But if you are missing the launchctl processes for munki the GUI cant run.  It works by writing a file privatetmp.com.googlecode.munki.updatecheck.launchd and that file is watched by launchctl which then starts up the rootlevel process which can run the update.  Without those the update cant happen the user probably doesnt have permission.You should have  few com.google.muni... launchdaemons in LibraryLaunchDaemons and those should be seen in sudo launchctl list. Its odd that you have the things in usrlocalmunki but not the other parts of the configuration.  Did you perhaps split out the munkitols package for some reason and only install the munktioolscore?Unless you have  reason just install the entire munkitools package it includes four sub packages one of which is munkitoolslaunchdversion and it installs the LaunchDaemons.You should be able to simulate the GUI by just doing touch privatetmp.com.googlecode.munki.updatecheck.launchd and then watching to see if usrlocalmunkimanagedsoftwareupdate manualcheck gets launched and the file removed.  You can check for it with ps see the file deletion and the logs in LibraryManaged SoftwareLogs will be updated. might have got the Managed Software part of that path wrong but its closeNote no sudo just do it as a normal user though an admin is ok.  ,macsysadmin,cq8xkt2,3,t5_2t01r

Then click the hovering stop button and export your workflow EDIT youll probably want to export as an app so you can doubleclick to run it and you may run in to issues with code signing on those if you dont have a developer account.Heres an example Workflow that opens the app store app clicks the main menu clicks About and then quits.Hopefully that helps in your case ,macsysadmin,cyxidza,1,t5_2t01r
