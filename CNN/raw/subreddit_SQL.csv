168777,0,t3_1vs8bi,Bad idea for querying the SQL Server. All data for sharepoint is put into  table and it isnt the easiest to pull the specific data needed. This is more of a rSharepoint or rSharepointdev question. But Ill give it a shot as i wear both hats. Option Have a workflow run after data is inputted that puts in specific information. So either dont include the fields as viewable or have them viewable but include a message saying that if left blank then itll fill with most recent information. Then have the workflow check each field for content if different replace if same or blank do nothing. You could even create an email to notify the user of what was changed.  Id also recommend having a hidden fieldflag that shows the most current information. Option  If the customer info is in a separate table than you can do this without a workflow you can create a lookup field to do this. Option You can use VBScript to pull the data from relevant places. You can actually grab it all from the XML which is constantly being published. I believe its the REST stuff. ,SQL,cexnnqv,1,t5_2qp8q

812444,0,t1_cgwgeav,Personally I use Oracles Data Modeler In addition to being free to use it allows you make your changes in the tool then compare them against a target database and generate the change script. You can restrict this to just the modified tables meaning you dont have loads of changes to wade through as you would for a full schema diff.Data changes are messier as they can be time sensitive and affected data differences between live and test. Writing small API packages is a good idea though.Having a duplicate QAUAT database to test run deployments against is a very good idea to help mitigate the risks youve identified. This is very feasible with small databases as you can generally find sufficient storage. Its when you get to very large databases that you run into issues as businesses are not always willingable to fund a complete duplicate of live.When it comes to rollback if youre on Oracle gR I would recommend looking at editionbased redefintion. This allows you to create to versions in your database so you can hide behind views table changes to some extent. Ive found it more useful when it comes to stored procedures though as you can have two versions of the code in one database. You can then smoketest changes before putting them live.Another option is to create guaranteed restore points prior to release. These enable you to quickly revert the database back to the state of the restore point if the rollout goes wrong. Doing so does require you to shutdown the database so may not always be a feasible solution if uptime matters. there is an equivalent in SQL server but I cant recall what its called at the moment.,SQL,cgwmnkm,2,t5_2qp8q

957616,0,t3_2521p1,gt Then is the only purpose for GROUP BY to use some aggregate function on the groupFor the most part.  By itself it can also function as a DISTINCT although its generally considered best practice to use DISTINCT when you need distinct records.Most RDBMSs do not allow fields in the GROUP BY clause unless theyre in an aggregate function.  MySQL is somewhat broken in this regard as they have transparent extensions to GROUP BY that most DBAs I know myself included consider broken.gt Also HAVING is just a quick way of filtering the table before the grouping begins e.g. getting rid of anything with an age of above   therefore saving having to do this as a nested query?Sort of but the way you put it is exactly backwards.  The WHERE clause happens prior to the GROUP BY and therefore it happens before any aggregate functions have been calculated.  So you cant use an aggregate function in the WHERE clause unless you use a subquery.  HAVING is done after all that but before the ORDER BY that does sorting.If you want a list of all songs that appear on more than one album and how often they appear for example    SELECT songid COUNTsongid AS songcount    FROM albumsong    GROUP BY songid    HAVING COUNTsongid gt ,SQL,chd51cd,1,t5_2qp8q

1547847,0,t1_cjaa4ms,Well that makes stuff WAY more complicated.I assumed that location was a fixed term not a quasirandom string generated by some sort of GPS device for good human readability.I dont think you can solve that problem easily with MySQL unless youre willing to guess that if the location string contains the words El Paso its actually near El Paso. However as you can see theres two locations in your list that say theyre near El Paso but theyre obviously different.You can also hope that if a truck is not moving the string does nog change. At all. Youll have to find out how the string are rendered otherwise youll never be sure about that.If I would have to attack this problem I would try to get coordinates in stead of strings. I assume these are auto generated from location data so the coordinates are available. Then I would make the assumption that if the truck location changes by less than m or any other cutoff depending on how far trucks normally move its stationary. Youll then have to calculate the distance between each next location and determine if the truck has actually moved or not. I would not try to do this is SQL though but get out some PythonRubyPHPC or whatever. BTW thanks for wasting my time by only now adding the information that location is not straightforward.

That said can you say with absolute certainty which date a.OrderDateb.OrderDate will always be larger? If not youll need to use an ABS to check against the absolute value otherwise DATEDIFF will return a negative if theyre in the wrong order. For example     Returns     SELECT DATEDIFFDD       Returns     SELECT DATEDIFFDD      Same as above but absolute value so ABS       SELECT ABSDATEDIFFDD  In your case the first thing Id try is     SELECT a.PatientID a.TestDate a.TestScore b.TestDate b.TestScore    FROM Tests a JOIN Tests b ON a.PatientIDb.PatientID    WHERE ABSDATEDIFFdda.OrderDateb.OrderDate gt Hope this helps. ,SQL,cjj281o,1,t5_2qp8q

But I think in hindsight I may have been too hasty with that assumption.

Usually what I do is grab and stage the data do my processing and updates on the staged data and then at the end have the transaction and do whatever insertupdate as needed.  For big updates  consider using a looped batch update say  of records at a time to allow other transactions through.So like thisTry  Stage data for each table to be updated manipulate  begin tran  update table from temp  update table from temp  update table from temp  batch process e.g. update only k records at a time if needed  commit tran  end try  ,SQL,cpp3jdj,1,t5_2qp8q

Got to know people in the data conversion team and basically was offered to hop over and help with the new branch of software that utilized MSSQL after I took a week long SQL class.  Other than that I learned as I went because most of what I do now is all manual data conversion nearly every data source we convert from requires extensive changes from every other data so theres no set process.

Then clean up and combine those separate temporary tables to populate a single data source.

7414495,0,t1_d2kmnlp,what is happening no matter what the columns are set to in the table is that the wizard is reading only the first few records i think default is .   either way in a flat file import or .csv same idea in the wizard.   set any of those long data types to string with a length of  i believe that is the max length on string data type.  so you are in the right spot but unless you set it specifically it will attempt to truncate it at  characters of length.  so go to advanced  set the column to string with a length of  and if there is no text qualifier then change that to false.  a text qualifier is when there are long unstructured data like a sentence typed up by a user think free form text and since a user can add a comma in their text which is a delimiter in your file then there may be a text qualifier around that column usually quotation marks.  see the link below. that change should do the trick.second on the reason that this is happening see suggest types on the import wizard under andvanced.  you will see the following if you click on suggest types.  I wouldnt use this though as i have had issues in the past especially with longer files more than k records or so. you can see how it defaults to  records.  basically it is supposed to read the file and check the first  records then based on what it sees it will suggest the type of data type to use.  lets say uou have  records with a character length of  then the st record has a character length of  then you will get the truncation error because it it trying to insert a character length of  when it set the column for a length of .   you usually wont have this issue with .csv or .txt files because it usually just places all fields as a string with  characters limit on it so going to advanced will help you specify what to use.  i.e. do you want to specify a column as an integer or varchar or float etc. this is where you do it.  ,SQL,d2kza6h,1,t5_2qp8q

10809723,0,t1_dduwmx3,Ill be honest. This is exactly the structure and tone of the answer I wanted to receive. Thanks for not making me sift through  snarky replies before finding a quality one.  I think youve nailed it.Im definitely the kind of guy to keep learning until I find the best way to do something and I do like understanding where things come from and how theyve evolved. Like how objectoriented programming seems unnecessarily tedious when youve never done anything complex and dataintensive. So I dont mind starting out doing things the hard way to make me better appreciate the shortcuts.I think I will get the book though Ill skim through some online materials at the same time to make sure Ill not missing anything new and super useful.Thanks again for the response!,SQL,dduy328,6,t5_2qp8q
10843960,0,t1_ddyfy15,I learned in an environment where we did most of our work in Prod.  F did that work?  No?  F  How about now?  Im still trying to unlearn some of the very bad habits I picked up there.  Runon Procedures that had s of branches  indexes on a table linked servers galore Views nested in Views nested in Views...  I wish I could go back and see what the code base looked like with the knowledge I have now.  That entire house of cards has been decommissioned.,SQL,ddyh85x,1,t5_2qp8q
10871846,0,t3_5vdtbs,Company I worked for changed domain name and asked for a set of scripts to do a general find  replace to update any occurrences of the old domain. One guy handled text files HTML pages etc and I got tasked with the database side of things. It was a huge company and I had no ability or permission to view even the schemas of any databases the script could potentially run on. So I ended up making a stored procedure that using the INFORMATIONSCHEMA tables scanned entire databases for any text based columns varchar char text etc and then did replace calls on them. Also required to make this script available for MySQL SQL Server Oracle and Postgres so I had to rewrite it to handle the nuances of each of those systems. Trickiest part was halfway through when we told told a specific subset of URLs had to remain the same old domain. So the stored procedure had to change to modify only occurrences of the domain name that were not part of specific list of URLs. It was truly awful especially since this task was being given to me and not being handled by individual DBAs of these different systems. I ended up finishing all of the scripts after testing them on locally deployed instances of each database server. To this day I only know of one DBA who actually attempted to run it. I honestly hope nobody else did. The scripts worked as intended in my many tests but general catchall scripts like that should NEVER be run by someone who doesnt have direct control of the system they are scripted for.All that being said it was a really fun stored proc to write lol.,SQL,de1cqdv,3,t5_2qp8q
10930123,0,t1_de7cr8x,Whoa I had no idea it was my cakeday!  Thank you for pointing it out!And to comment on the OR vs AND performance the query should use shortcircuit logic meaning that it should stop evaluating the remainder of the where clause for the row as soon as one of the OR conditions is met.  So in that sense an OR can be perform better than an AND condition.  An AND would necessarily evaluate all conditions.  On top of that it is a NOT EXISTS clause so it will also stop evaluating more rows of the same roomnumber value once it finds a single existing row.,SQL,de7d5ra,1,t5_2qp8q
11020487,0,t3_5xbcft,In  years as a database developer I have never seen anyone use numbers except in the case when you are doing a query to check if something exists and dont actually care about what column is selected.

If this is more than a onetime exercise the best solution I can think of is to add source and target state fields  if not an isInterstate flag  and populate them in ETL. If not that Id try to build a table mapping all area codes to states and using the or  not and logic.But if its not a common exercise Id probably just do the IN lists.,SQL,den2ey0,3,t5_2qp8q

I said that there are clear advantages from timetotime in ignoring them.  All best practices work that way.  A particular best practice is the way it is because using that technique produces the most favorable outcomes in the widest array of situations.  However there are always exceptions to the rule and after thoroughly understanding the best practice you can learn the right times to ignore it.  Learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like an artist.  Pablo Picassogt Youre ignoring them by the virtue of being ignorant in the first place.Dont assume ignorance.

11738490,0,t1_dgqkgnb,A cluster is great for failover redundancy. You may have a minor delay in uptime always on is a better solution for this but is also more complicated and more of a pain. Mirroring is a good idea but probably over kill because you need the same server X . With a cluster you need the same server X  but the disks can be shared and failover from one node to the other. For clustering you must configure server clustering. Once the servers are clustered  this is all outside of SQL Server this is sys admin stuff at the server os level you can begin the SQL Server portion of clustering which I think is easier.Once clustered lets say you have the two servers we will call them node  and node . If the DB and disks reside on node  and node  is patched and reboots the db and disks are allocated over to node . Node  is now running the db and has the disks. There can be a delay here which can hurt uptime. Our delay is  seconds. If node  goes down it would then move the db and disks over to node . With mirroring if it goes down you may be able to access a read only version of the DB if you repoint the connectors to it. Or if you have a listener setup you point to the listener so youre always looking at whats active. ,SQL,dgql659,1,t5_2qp8q
