2363661,0,t1_cm3rbq7,The biggest difference people notice is that EWS Eve WSpace uses strictly hierarchical mapping and currently doesnt automtically generate friendly system names like ca or F. There is a free alpha site set up for testing so you can play around with it and see if it fits your preferences.,wormholers,cm3uwyg,2,t5_34hib

9865972,0,t3_5gncui,Mr. Timoxa the same question to you. Its about putting money  more money into the pockets of C Escalation runners. You have up to two minutes.Thank you Porkbut. Our posters are fleeing the sub. Theyre going to reve. Theyre going to many other subreddits. You look at what rEve is doing to our subreddit in terms of making our posts. Theyre devaluing their karma and theres nobody in our mod team to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because theyre using our subreddit as a piggy bank to rebuild rEve and many other subreddits are doing the same thing.So were losing our good posters so many of them. When you look at whats happening in Delve a friend of mine who kills rats said its the eighth wonder of the world. Theyre killing the most rats out of anywhere in the world some of the most high some of the best rats. With C sites as he said not so much.So WSpace Citizen is leaving. You see that their lowclass division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving C space leaving C space. Theyre all leaving. And we cant allow it to happen anymore. As far as escalations is concerned and so many other things I think uSteelRoamer and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what were going to do but perhaps well be talking about that later.But we have to stop our posters from being stolen from us. We have to stop our corporations from leaving WSpace and with it SDing all their ships on their citadel. All you have to do is take a look at Hispanic Enterprises in  Pulsar. They left  self destructed over  capital ships.Theyre going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of corps are doing this.We cannot let it happen. Under my plan Ill be reducing Upgraded Avenger EHP tremendously from k  to k. Thats going to be a krab creator like we havent seen since Sleepless Guardians. Its going to be a beautiful thing to watch.Corporations will come. They will build. They will expand. New Corporations will start. And I look very very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals and we have to stop these kspace alliances from stealing our corporations and our posters. Thank you.,wormholers,datk4p6,11,t5_34hib

10693711,0,t1_ddiryec,Look tim as I said in praise Bob Im not going to play these angsty and childish games with you. Im playing a game which I truly enjoy and have fun with. Im not here to engage people in juvenile games of name calling that are better left for the playground. Fly safe o and have a beautiful day. ,wormholers,ddiz6mg,-7,t5_34hib
10699700,0,t3_5sg1xz,ill be honest some of the most fun ive had in eve is just whelping T ships for shits and giggles. If you want to fight and were around we can generally ship into anything you want  get in public and ask for a fight. ,wormholers,ddjlewe,1,t5_34hib
10838401,0,t1_ddxwh4r,Anyone hitting your tower will usually be well within lock range unless damps are focused they wont stop anyone shooting your POS jams on the other hand can break logi chains and actually have a negative effect on anyone attacking.Its also makes it more of a pain in the arse to shoot at,wormholers,ddxwkb5,4,t5_34hib

10875132,0,t3_5v4two,My issue is that the current counter argument is that the established pvp groups will not evict you if your trying to pvp when in reality every other type of space has plenty of ratting etc which can go on without the same risk of total eviction without asset safety and anything using timers means your stuffed by random for rorqs and dreads.CCP need to make the isk you get from normal holes slightly lower make c and c stuff harder so you have to field caps for them for the proper payout give c better spawn ranges and a minor drifter as planned and then buff the isk you can make in shattered holes.Shattereddrifter holes should be where the isk really is and the established groups should be fighting over them as hotspots rather than just running their own dozen farm holes which nobody can touch because by the time the POS timer comes out they got the main corp in.Lower class groups can fight for the smaller ones and that way everybody gets more isk when they put out in the dangerous holes.C and C should also get a null static let them play with the larger entities if they want that space.,wormholers,de1oxtp,2,t5_34hib
11053798,0,t3_5xtp2h,Like anyone really cares but for my  centsI put uNoobmanHK and usullendecimus at the top of my ticket this year.  I can find no fault with Noobmans performance on the CSM between the two summits and various roundtables. And Sullen while not an exclusive wormhole CSM candidate has been a persistent figure in the various discussions Ive seen on Tweetfleet etc. and should get a second run.Unfortunately I hadnt hear of or know of Lillike Eoner in the various podcasts and such that she completely slipped my radar. I specifically did not include ujohndune on my voting. His views of wormhole space and his platform as an amateur game developer was more than enough for me to believe he would not be a good CSM representative.  Just his statements in this thread that he doesnt know what noobman did on the CSM this year is more than enough to validate my decision.,wormholers,dekxgpf,23,t5_34hib
