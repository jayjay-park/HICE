5679505,0,t1_cwqineb,Ive tried Goblin Lore before and I dislike it because it is only at its best while youre going off. In the early game it is a lot more likely to discard a key spell than Ravings. Ravings is usually worse during the combo turn but usually it is enough to find what you need especially with Ascension active.Also is the Mind Grind for selfmill a win condition or both?,mtgstorm,cx13kku,1,t5_391et

7712114,0,t3_4k6wp1,Hmm. I dont think I like this list. Youre sacrificing speed but... what are you supposed to be getting in exchange? It doesnt look like consistency to me. Much much much less reliance of the graveyard though. Maybe a list like this would be the way to go if people start playing truly insane amounts of graveyard hate? ,mtgstorm,d3itcz3,1,t5_391et
8678033,0,t3_4ymmfg,REOPFinkels list is the baseline. You can then tinker to preference meta and possibly consider updating the sideboard anger over pyroclasm shattering spree over shatterstorm second truth over the defence grid it just depends on where you fee you are struggling.  Ive recently started including one empty main over one PiF because of the amount of BGx decks in my area.  ,mtgstorm,d6qdm1c,1,t5_391et
