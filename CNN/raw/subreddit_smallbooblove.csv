8887687,0,t3_51zp27,I agree completely with this poster. And I use it squarely as evidence to the contrary for anyone having a men who prefer small breasts dont exist! kind of rant. ,smallbooblove,d7g6abr,3,t5_3f944
9320931,0,t1_d8x5bcb,gt After a young adult life of hating my breasts and my abnormally small body I really wasnt doing anything besides putting myself down and resenting curvy women. As Ive gotten a tiny bit older I have realized how important it is to love my unique body and know what amazing things it can do someday.You are way ahead of the game. I compare it to coming up for air. Its so easy to get steeped in societys stereotype about what breasts should be. It will drown your selfconfidence and make you spend your money chasing products claiming to cure your problems. But when you pull out of that you realize what a farce it is. Because no one ever becomes perfect enough with that thinking. No one in this cycle makes peace with their body. Even the most ideal women feel unworthy and the most classically beautiful models are still photoshopped. Being content is not the goal of those putting these pressures on us. They want us to be insecure unsure and spending our cash to fix our bodies. Content people are so harder to manipulate. gtI guess one day I realized I am who I am and this is what I was born with!Exactly right. And youve got every reason to celebrate it.

9798415,0,t1_dakjbp3,Lol well I definitely never would have guessed that reason.  I still see your username and think of small perfect breasts. I promised I tried  times to make that not sound pervy and that was the best I could do lol ,smallbooblove,dakv72e,2,t5_3f944
