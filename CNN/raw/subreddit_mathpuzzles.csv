4439478,0,t3_3bwpim,For an x by y grid assuming y gt x y  x  k where kgt the total number of squares is equal to the number of squares in an x by x grid plus k...x. Number of squares in an x by x grid is ...x.spoilerSo the question is are there solutions to k...x  ...x   for nonnegative integer values of x k? Case by casespoilerx   k gives  total squares. spoilerx   or  no solution for k being an integer.spoilerx   k   is a solution.spoilerx   k   is a solution.spoilerx   no integer solution.spoilerx gt  original square grid has too many squares.spoilerIn summary there are three solutions the  by  grid the  by  grid and the  by  grid.spoiler,mathpuzzles,csqa4bi,2,t5_2tiks

But if those two persons would give top  siplest answers I would bet correct answer with this puzzle would be on those lists.spoiler What is the simplest function that maps multiple natural numbers to single natural number?spoiler What is the simplest function that maps natural numbers to single digits?spoilerGuidelinesTake any number Z in the puzzle. Take numbers Zn of Zs simplest neighbourhood. Apply the simplest function Fn that maps multiple natural numbers to single natural number with numbers Zn as Fns arguments. Apply the simplest function F that maps natural numbers to single digits to result FnZn giving FFnZn. Verify that Z  FFnZn for reasonable amount of numbers. Probability of one Z to be verified is   . With six numbers one should be confident with . percentage level.spoiler,mathpuzzles,df3arxq,1,t5_2tiks
