956328,0,t1_chcyzjh,Oh man. I think I would advise him not to put technology in the corner. The biggest mistake the President and his staff made was thinking that the website and the policy were independent of each other. Our friend Tom Steinberg from mySociety said something like government and governance nowadays are inextricably linked to the digital. You cant do policy anymore and not consider the digital rollout as central to its success.,socialcitizens,chczrap,2,t5_2wllr
1309560,0,t1_cigrljv,This is a great question. I often do feel the I wish we had more time! pressure... The I wish we were working this Friday! pressure because theres always more stuff to do. But thats a shortterm impulse. The truth is very few things other than emergencies cant wait until Monday. And the benefits of a shorter work week pay off far down the road while the benefits of putting in an extra Friday are very temporary.But yes its hard sometimes. I just have to remind myself of the longterm benefits... Happier people extended weekends better rest more time to think more time to experience stuff outside of work etc. All this makes for better people and better people are the kind of people we want here.Lastly... We only do the day weeks from May  October so its more of a seasonal benefit than a permanent reality. Ive always liked the seasons and I think its good for business to model some of those natural cycles.BTW The fridays off thing only applies to people whove been working at Basecamp for at least a year. New employees put in full weeks their first year so they get as much exposure to how we work as possible.,socialcitizens,cigxx5d,5,t5_2wllr

7014795,0,t1_d1bh0df,Well the only serious cost here is to the organizations collecting the food its a smart but empty marketing move to get people to feel good about their overpriced coffee.There was a period where starbucks was doing good work to prevent themselves from becoming the McDonalds of coffee but it went from genuine effort to lip service to low effort lip service.,socialcitizens,d1bh49w,1,t5_2wllr
