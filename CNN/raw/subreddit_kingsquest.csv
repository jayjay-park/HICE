7412915,0,t3_4gn5lt,Im about an hour and a half in and I had to put it down due to boredom. The story is competent enough but the gameplay just feels like an absolute chore to get through. Its way too linear for my tastes. Maybe it gets better but from what Im reading I doubt it. I dont mind a linear section here and there but the core of Kings Quest has always been exploration to me. Chapter  and  had enough of it to satisfy me. In this one I feel like there are as many cutscenes as gameplay. I was growing tired of feeling restricted in Telltale games then the first Chapter of Kings Quest came out and it was a breath of fresh air. This Chapter feels exactly like the Telltale episodes I had become sick of. This is definitely my least favorite entry. I liked Chapter  more than most people did. It wasnt as good as Episode  but I really appreciated being able to explore and that I actually had to use my brain on subsequent replays to figure out how to save different people.Ill get around to finishing Chapter  at some point and I really hope that the next chapters are more open.,kingsquest,d2kssri,3,t5_2urpu
