10923723,0,t3_5vnlym, and Im part of the problem. A year or two ago I was better at pushing whats happening this month and favorite x style posts. I got busy and havent been doing that very well lately. What do you want to see here? How do we drive content? What can I do to make this thrive rather than lurch along like a Hamms seeking zombie? Is an automod posting thing what you want? Do you want to drive the conversation? Or do you want mod posts to draw in things? So tell me what you want what you really really want? ,wisconsinbeer,de6pfa5,2,t5_2v5kc
