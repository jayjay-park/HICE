2631254,0,t1_cn1t3b6,THANK YOU for your time on this. I honestly hope you can get some benefit from this new setup writing your own modules as youve clearly put some time into this. I have the entire day tomorrow cleared out so I can deal with Reliably compiling Godot from source Generating the export templates for the existing target platforms with the new c module added Getting a NaCl example working. I also see code to export to Flash but that seems like a longshot.Anyhow THANK YOU for your help kind stranger!,godot,cn21ezm,2,t5_2znmk

6658110,0,t1_d07tf9p,Thanks punto Saving on some conoles do seem very complicated indeed. Fortunately Im going for pc and possibly osx for now. My main problem is rather more basic how to put things from different places at different times into one file and still be able to keep track of them and so on. Atm each save slot concists of one directory with a whole bunch of files in it. Could this be a problem on osx systems?,godot,d0808a8,1,t5_2znmk

7015790,0,t3_4bqpm0,Thats because the button is a child of the generic Control node and not the main window. Did you make sure the parent node was sized anchored properly?,godot,d1bl6bv,7,t5_2znmk
7211230,0,t1_d1xua3u,Im doing too much school work and not even development work outside of webdev to warrant Linux at the moment. Ive used Linux a decent bit and am plenty happy using it. Just find the time to do that all.FYI Here are the steps I take.. Open Godot stable .. win x. Select Import and navigate to teh .zip extracted folder from here and select the engine.cfg. Select Edit from the main project menu.. So far I have the main container.scn which is the boundaries for the ball the bounce in. This seems to load ok.. Press the  button to add a branched node to the container node and select ball.scn. As soon as I select open with that the whole software crashes.This is the log that it produces. As I said Im new enough and just playing around that I have no clue what it is. Thanks for your help so far. In the end I may need to work on developing and writing the story or structure for the game until the semester is over before I dive in and try to develop this.,godot,d1xuzri,2,t5_2znmk

8993655,0,t1_d7svst8,Hmmmm Im not sure what a good solution would be it seems like a very specific problem that has to be solved specifically.I dont exactly know how youre doing things but a menu even animated shouldnt be very large. My first reflex is to think youre doing something wrong not saying you are just that it is my first thought.A few random ideasIf your animations are slidingmovingrotating things replace handmade animations with procedural ones driven by code. If theyre highlightswobblewatery effects replace them with shadersIf your assets are big and if youre making them big so they look good on large tablets consider having your assets in different resolutions and either outputting different builds for different machines or dynamically loading the correct assets after checking the screen size.Also Im not sure animation brings anything to a mobile menu hover animations are nice but they are obsolete on mobiles and animations on click need to be minimal and fast anyway so maybe just consider dropping animations or drastically simplifying them?I dont know if any of those work for you as I dont know what youre animating. As I said its a specific problem. sorry I cant help more!,godot,d7swc6n,1,t5_2znmk
9055210,0,t3_54920d,You were checking for collisions between the feet and ground in the same frame that you pressed jump. So jumping was set to true and then instantly set to false a few lines down. So I added a short timer so that the game gives the player a few milliseconds before checking for collision with the ground so the player can get off the ground.Sent a pull request with the fixes! ,godot,d80aiad,1,t5_2znmk
9318418,0,t1_d8wgrui,Ok but a question on exports doesnt that mean that every single object in my game with have a script attached if I go that route? Isnt there overhead for scripts  or are the scripts wrapped into the resource itself and therefore dont really require separate handling? According to some tuts I read too many scripts in your Godot project can negatively affect performance.Please advise.,godot,d8x6ej5,2,t5_2znmk
9402232,0,t3_595il0,This is definitely something holding me back from wanting to work with Godot. There are other game engines which are much easier to integrate with different achievements leaderboards iaps and ads than Godot.

9720022,0,t1_dab2gdf,But you shouldnt want to set a noninteger scaling on a pixel sprite itll look ugly. You need to know your size beforehand and create your sprite accordingly. That would be the best way. If youre not doing that and its fine not to whats the difference between setting a visual scale that sorta looks like you want it to and pixel values?The only difference is for your developer brain that youve somehow entered integer pixel values. However the result for anyone else will be the same whether you arbitrary scale a sprite to fit a size or set pixel values ugly upscaling or downscaling and either bad blending of pixels or bad aliasing.,godot,dab7cxv,2,t5_2znmk

9910963,0,t1_daze9t7,Very interesting. Do you know what the students in Godot missed from Unity? Sure the convenience features were not available but you said why it wasnt a bad thing. However did the students missed for instance the unity asset store? Or some kind of advanced feature? I can guess for instance that the d map editor from unity is very handy.,godot,dazf6ny,5,t5_2znmk

10753547,0,t1_ddp18ml,Yes you really need to learn how to program first and just jumping into Godot without that knowledge will probably be frustrating since there arent basic programming tutorials for Godot as far as I know. I think its a good idea to start with some Python tutorials like my favorite Program Arcade Games with Python and Pygame I think you can read only the Python specific chapters and skip the Pygame chapters if you dont want to learn that but its better to read the whole book. rlearnpython has other good resources in the wiki But if you already know how to program then its sufficient to read the Godot docs and watch the available video tutorials gamefromscratch.com is pretty good.,godot,ddp5a9z,5,t5_2znmk

11189609,0,t1_dezl6wu,Yes exactly spring joints it actually took a few more than I would have thought it needed. The spring joints are not particularly strong in different directions either so there are actually two opposing ones facing the front and back to dampen the forward movement. Without those the top sways a lot and does not hold in place as well.,godot,df0bupi,1,t5_2znmk
