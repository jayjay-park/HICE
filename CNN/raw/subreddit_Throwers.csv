Hes not only singlehandedly responsible for everything relating to YYBB he also runs two very large and awesome contests each year which are consistently playerfavorites. Not to mention hes a freaking world champion so he obviously knows what most competitive players want. With everything that he has and continues to contribute to the community youd think that a few small mishaps with orders which were immediately corrected wouldnt be a huge deal. His availability and willingness to talk to individual customers to sort out any issues as well as the generous extras he typically includes in each package make his customer service pretty much unparalleled within the community. Were lucky to have dope people like JD around to keep everyone stoked about throwing and for those of you who complain about his service I implore you to attempt to be as successful in the industry as he has so you can understand that what youre throwing little tantrums about is pathetic. ,Throwers,chxai52,6,t5_2s97a

1671630,0,t3_2dieed,Heres a few answers in random order.Quick Fix Switch the bearings.The only reason your whip is responsive is the bearing. However since the Whip is supposed to be unresponsive theres one thing to check. If both bearings are the same width your whip is oiled with thick lube and you can switch them safely. If your whip has a thin bearing it wont work because the cyphers axle is too long. I just checked with my unresponsive whip my cypher and the thin bearing YYF puts inside the One.If you can bind or are willing to learn theres really no real reason to make your cypher responsive.Responsive will teach you to work with less spin time and to be smoother in your movements. In fact you could learn new tricks on your unresponsive and then try to pull them off on the whip. As for superlubricating yes and no. Superlubricating with thin lube wont last long theres just so much oil you can put inside the bearing and its a question of time before it sets in. Thick lube would do a better job as the coating around each ball is thicker and stickier... if that makes any sense.,Throwers,cjpvcz1,1,t5_2s97a

That got another friend of mine interested in messing around with the cube. He could never solve it quicker then me so he decided to pick up a new hobby. He chose the yoyo and I followed suit. During that same time we moved over to yoyoing we googled the internet for cool looking yoyos and found out there was a local company releasing their first yoyo the Project. We then went stalker mode and got in touch with the folks at One Drop and they had some prototypes floating around in the Portland area. Meet up with PDX YoYo Crew and was instantly blown away by it. I must meet the minds behind this yoyo. Took a trip down here to the shop and hung out with the the owners David and Shawn who are now the big bosses. I never really thought about being sponsored at the time I was really thankful they allowed a bloke like myself to walk into their shop and just hang out and yoyo. Naturally I got a little better and they recognized it and offered me a spot on their team.

3931908,0,t3_35hi1z,Ive been throwing for about  weeks and in that time have purchased about  different throws. If I were to start over today at that budget I would probably buy a YoYoJam Classic and a Loop . But that is because I personally also enjoy the looping style and I like going back and forth between the two styles. However if I were only interested in string tricks I know exactly what I would do I would buy a YoYoJam classic and a YoYo Factory Replay Pro. The YYJ Classic is an excellent throw and even though it is very inexpensive it is still one of the most popular plastic YoYos even among more advanced players. The Replay Pro is also in my opinion as good as any throw under . But whats great is that the two have totally different shapes etc.So you start with the Classic which is responsive and learn the basic tricks practice your sleeper etc. Learning to throw a good sleeper and breakaway is the cornerstone of string tricks. This was easier for me before I learned how to bind well with a responsive YoYo because you can keep throwing and throwing and after every throw the YoYo comes back and you just throw again. As opposed to throw grab the YoYo wrap the string around it manually or do a shitty bind and throw it again which takes  times as long. Within a day or two you will have those down and are ready to move to unresponsive.  And then the beauty of this approach is that the YYJ can easily be upgraded to unresponsive. You just change the bearing and the pads takes like thirty seconds. The end result is that you had an awesome responsive YoYo to start and end up with two awesome unresponsive YoYos. And those YoYos are on different ends of the spectrum as far as shape weight etc so you can then mess around with both to see which feels best to you. Thats what I would do. ,Throwers,cr4h17b,4,t5_2s97a

Although that is at an insane price that in my short one throw experience Id deem probably not worth it. You dont typically see them hit the used market because the primary consumer of  dollar yoyos probably isnt actually using them much less reselling them. Never had an AntiYo BSP but people love the hell out of those. Also the upcoming YYF TiDream and OD CiTizen look pretty solid too. Id say the CiTizen will probably be floating around the top of the list too but hey who knows. Never touched it.If you can find a TiWalker or a yo Ti go for it. I dont know that the rest were worth the price of admission.,Throwers,cs6bm0n,5,t5_2s97a

Just go to the bearings page and theyre under the regular DS bearings its just an option you select in the drop down box for adding to your cart.I havent played with the type  much at all. I put one on for about  minutes and Id say its pretty comparable to kitty and blueprint kind of a hybrid between the two. A bit stiffer than kitty a bit softer than blueprints.

Also some tricks dont have a definite end so the bind creates a standard universal end point that everyone can agree on. And just from an anecdotal perspective when I do a trick in front of my friends and at  the end and go to bind and then miss it and have to go grab the YoYo people will say Oh almost had it! I consider it as not having executed the trick perfectly.Either way luckily he has a second chance to try it again,Throwers,cshedf3,4,t5_2s97a

You try to throw loop it will just twist and turn. Looping yoyos are designed for looping not just because they are responsive but because of the way they are shaped.  String trick yoyos are designed for string tricks not just because they are unresponsive but because of the way they are shaped. Even a  string trick yoyo is not going to loop as well as an eight dollar looping yoyo no matter what you do to it. ,Throwers,ct3e71d,1,t5_2s97a

4582349,0,t3_3dshpm,Hey Pahlz. OneDrop is known to ship their wonderful ten ball bearings with a healthy dose of lube which usually works itself out in just a few hours. If you want it to be unresponsive lube is not the way to go it would only make it more responsive. A little bit if lube in a clean bearing is said to prolong the life of them and it also helps shut them up a bit. DIf youve already clocked some serious hours then it is likely not needing breaking in. The next step is to open her up and check it out. Make sure there is no string fiber or hair or other debris in the bearing seat. Then you may want to try cleaning it. I cant link a tutorial at the moment but Im sure one of our brothers will answer the call with a video. After you clean the bearing it may be worth adding Just a drop on thin lube. If none of this helps Id recommend emailing OneDrop as the problem would likely be a defective bearing  or potentially a defective yoyo.Best of luck. ,Throwers,ct87gyr,6,t5_2s97a
4587559,0,t1_ct8udez,Shape. The reason why someone would pick a certain aluminum yoyo over a bimetal is the shape and how the weight IS distributed. Sometimes you look for centered weight or a wide shape or underoversized diameters. The material involved also changes how you can shape the yoyo I.e. a titanium yoyo can have much thinner walls than a  yoyo because of the strength of titanium so they can have more material around the center or the rim edges. A bimetal has to be cut down to make room for the heavy rings that would be put on the rims or it will be too heavy.There isnt a betterbest kind of scenario so like you said its pretty subjective. It just boils down to different kinds of distribution of weight. Preference is something you develop over time I still dont even know what I want.,Throwers,ct8uylh,2,t5_2s97a

I only managed to do this on a lathe while going very slowly  the rubber just deformed and chunks of rubber came out without making a clean hole when I did it by hand.You want the weight between  grams  if possible. Two normal dice can work or one larger  die. A bouncy ball is a tad bit too light but will do fine.Gonna have to do the math yourself if you want to use other materials. If you dont have power tools you could cobble something together out of random stuff. Hot glue lengths of plastic straw in between two pennies  pennies   grams then wrap duct tape andor craft foam around the entire assembly so it doesnt hurt like metal and for a little extra weight. Fill in the dead space with hot glue and it should be somewhere around the right weight. ,Throwers,cut6vtf,2,t5_2s97a

5517974,0,t3_3qj5od,I prefer yoyos for two reasons. It is a lot easier to learn new tricks. Learning kendama stuff takes forever and I get demotivated a long time before doing anything consistently. Easy yoyo tricks looks impressive to an untrained eye. Really hard kendama tricks looks easy. Before I tried the kendama I thought I could do a bunch of the harder tricks I saw. Boy was I wrong!

5628045,0,t3_3rz3jp,Youll get used to the string. I also have hardened skin on the left side of my pointer finger from where the string rubs on it when doing a trapeze. I hear people use things like sports tape or bandages or maybe even try a bit of paper or tissue paper and wrap it around and then tighten the string  to hold it in place to make it hurt less. You can also get finger wrap tape from some yoyo stores if you want to go that route but may be cheaper to try some bandaids or something from the cupboard first to see how you get on with those. It could also be string related as I do notice some strings hurt more than others so you may find what you prefer in time but in that time you will also get used to it all anyway.You could get the unresponsive kit but Id say its better to put the money towards an unresponsive yoyo. Find a Replay Pro or something like that which is pretty cheap. Either way you can learn so much with a standard responsive YYJ Classic so maybe just keep going at it with what youve got. You can still learn all the basic mounts and tricks with the responsive YYJ Classic without to worry about having to bind each time when practicing. You can learn from beginner with either setup though so its up to you ,Throwers,cwupo5n,1,t5_2s97a

Theyre arranged in difficulty and some frontstyle tricks are more difficult than some sidestyle ones.

The N is my favorite simply because I love the shape and finish but the M Silencer and M April are definitely better performance wise plus theyre MYYs most modern series. The M is very stable and spins a long time but I think the finish is awful for grinds. The M is what I think is the best all around yoyo I own so far. Its not as stable as the M but its very fast and spins a very long time. Its amazing for grinds and its just a fun and really amazing yoyo for its price. Plus it looks really good and has some great color options. So its up to you. If you like grinding and faster spin I would recommend the M April but if you want more stability Id recommend the M Silencer. ,Throwers,cx4k32k,2,t5_2s97a

5729594,0,t3_3tltih,I think that Kitty Fat strings are liked by a lot of throwers but they I hear they get dirty quickly and dont last long if you throw for hours each day and theyre not super taught like certain others. From what I can tell people just buy a pack from a different company every once in a while and test them out. You can narrow down what may be more up your alley using your play style and personal preferences when it comes to tricks and feel of the string rough vs soft taught vs slack. Its good to keep in mind that some break in after some use and become better. There are plenty of string reviews out there Id take a look at those if I were you.I havent seen something of a sampler pack anywhere but Ill be looking at the one on YoYoUSA now. The Candywire on yoyosf looks like a good compromise between kitty and the rougher tougher stuff I may give that a shot next.,Throwers,cx7b8jv,1,t5_2s97a

Good news is you can convert just about anything you want to responsive fairly easily with a slim or halfspec C bearing and thick pads not always necessary.  YYJam makes a lot of undersized plastics with metal rings.  I have an XCon Pro that I love.  Very small diameter and plays very well.  Outside of your budget new but chances are you can get one used for next to nothing if you ask around.If youre not opposed to metal YYF sells a DV that comes responsive which I think is one of the best stock responsives.  Easy to upgrade to unresponsive as well.  Should be a great size for her.  Thatd be my recommendation.

Trumpet slide oil will make them spin while the yoyo is moving more like they dont spin with the yoyo because there is a small amount of friction so they keep their own momentumHeavier oil like motor oil or responsive lube will make them less likely to spin meaning they spin with the yoyo instead of freelyMagic yoyo bearings have generally had as good of spin times as more expensive bearings for me and Ive bought from a couple suppliers.

Meanwhile Weebus has no reason to lie no horse in the race his opinion is ignored and he just wants the same thing everyone does awesome yoyos. Because of what? A baseless claim from someone whos interest it is to get people to buy a yoyo. Please dont get me wrong. I love One Drop yoyos. Theres over  worth of one drops in my collection I bought all  of them new to support your company and I could never sell any of them because they are wonderful. Its because I love you that I am sometimes overly critical of you. I know you can do amazing things way beyond what I could hope to achieve with a yoyo.So its with that love that I beg of you to not make such rash baseless claims At least attempt to prove the statement wrong with a real argument rather than accusing a very loyal customer of being wrong. Considering the timing of this reply nearly  weeks after the post was originally posted the OP has likely made their decision long ago so this reply serves little more than an insult.If this is Paul which I assume it is.

6621315,0,t1_d040vb2,I mean dont put words in my mouth. I didnt say that. That doesnt mean I necessarily know how to make rThrowers or yoyo in general more friendly toward women though.The answer when it comes to explicit sexism is the easy one... because identification and decision making is easy so the answer is easy to provide. Sexist in nature enters an area that is more up for interpretation from a moderation standpoint than blatant sexism. A teams page is posted.... despite the team being sized  members there are  women. Could this be interpreted as sexist? Maybe. The team is obviously lacking in gender diversity. The owner may not be aware... but its still lacking.Should I delete posts about companys teams because they arent diverse and therefore not actively more womenfriendly? I dont think so. BUT IT STILL MIGHT BE DISCOURAGING if youre a new player and you see that no one like you is on your favorite team. That has a negative effect on female players.So where is that line? In addition I dont really think that its a subreddit that is unfriendly to women. Do you? Past the example of the mousepad... which was sexist in nature... is there really much more? Over what period of time? To what degree?Please know that Im open to active dialogue despite the downvotes youre receiving. This is in no way hostile.,Throwers,d04792f,4,t5_2s97a
6627019,0,t1_d04o3zt,Ok wow thats really all I can say in response to this youve obviously already made up your mind and decided to be offended Ill type out a response but honestly I expect itll fall on deaf ears. You are literally  being the very thing you detest by making the assumption that .k people are sexist because literally one single example of something sexist exists on this board with literally only  comments. You are literally saying that right now less than . of throwers have made one single sexist remark in the history of the subreddit and that makes the whole community irredeemably sexist until its removed? I bet youd be hard pressed to find a single other subreddit with less sexism.  Imo that mousepad isnt even sexist the comments might have been jokes in poor taste but who gives a fuck if you can get a mousepad with boobs you can get one with a guys butt and bulge on it instead if that is your thing are those sexist to guys in the same way you suggest the mouspad supposedly is to women? Even if the mousepad is something to be offended about you are going out of your way to be offended by it. Like you are really going to be pissed about one whole post that happened  months ago? out of probably thousands of posts that are just yoyo? How ridiculous talk about a battle that doesnt need to be fought. Lastly what do you even hope to gain by having that post removed? I guarantee no one is going back to look at it it was just a run of the mill mail post if something in the future offends you just report it otherwise get over it its in the past and no one but you gives a shit.,Throwers,d04shfg,2,t5_2s97a
6628930,0,t1_d04z5o0,Ending sexism is about making everyone equal by arguing that the female mousepad is somehow sexist while the male one isnt is completely backwards from what you yourself are fighting for. The best thing to do is just step back and realize that both mousepads are weird but people can like whatever they want. Also since you admit to being a guy what makes you think you can decide what is sexist? You literally said this Why do you as a dude who is lucky enough to not be affected by sexism get to decide when somethings sexist or not? doesnt that mean you dont get to decide what is sexist either? ,Throwers,d04zlb3,1,t5_2s97a

7000420,0,t3_4bk17j,A little help on deciding  The OD Gauntlet The Gauntlet has a pretty light feeling and is pretty floaty if you slow down. Its pretty good for speed and it can handle almost anything. It feels really round and smooth in your hand and comfy. Its a wider yoyo compare to the average yoyo so its going to be easier to land a lot of tricks. Its also not bad for a regular finger grind and you can learn a finger spin on it. The OD Vanguard I havent tried this yoyo to much but here what I have to say. It is not very heavy and you can go a faster speed but its going to take a little more effort to move it competition speed combo speed. Its going to be a little harder for accuracy because it is not very wide but it not bad. Finger grinds arent as good as the Gauntlet but it can finger spin almost as well as the Gauntlet. Its a pretty fun yoyo and not a bad choice. YYF Shutter If you havent seen Brandon Vus review of the Shutter then you should see it. Like he said its an all rounder yoyo and pretty good for most things. It isnt excessively good at anything in particular but can pretty much do what you want.

7520573,0,t3_4icxs7, Tranquility. I notice that I seem to actually do the best when I am throwing and get lost in thought.  I keep my throws all around the house. Usually right when I get home after I greet my dogs and my wife I grab one and start throwing. It seems to reset my mind and kind of clear it of the shit that bothered me at work.  I am a big sports fans and I usually throw during the many many commercials. It relaxes me.  Sense of accomplishment. When you finally get  a trick down its like beating a hard level in a video game. But it is better. Because I can keep doing the trick over and over and it is always still satisfying because I continue to realize the thought and practice it took to get me there. Also unlike video games you can show your wife and friends Check out this trick I finally learned! And they actually care.  If I say to my wife Hey check out this boss I beat in the third world level .  She doesnt really care. But when I make the yoyo do cool spinny flippy things she is like SO COOL!l The community.

With such a small player base I estimate there are maybe  people in the world that can bind an unresponsive yoyo it is necessary that there are a variety of models to create intensive for people to buy more than one yoyo and have the business be viable financially.This also gives manufactures incentive to continue to adjust and refine yoyos causing rapid and steady improvements to the design not seen in all industries.I think either the  era or the bimetal era were in now is the golden age of yoyo technology and tricks. ,Throwers,d37plig,3,t5_2s97a

8088094,0,t3_4q0ba9,A strange thing that I find is that just pushing your fingers apart as far as possible does not work.  the strings will fall of or move down to the base of the finger or the yoyo will hit your palm.  I find that i let my hand be more of a C shape.  if your tips are a little closer that is not that big a deal because they will be near where the gap of the yoyo is anyway.  So you basically make the C shape with my hand then straighten out my fingertips just slightly.Think like you are holding a deck of cards the long way with your fingertips.  Your fingers would have a natural curve to them and end fairly straight. ,Throwers,d4p6c05,4,t5_2s97a

8674564,0,t3_4yrqn9,The yoyo must be completely horizontal to properly fingerspin.  When going for the soft finger I recommend putting no effort into holding your finger up.  It will probably naturally rest at about a  degree angle which is perfect for fingerspins.  If you tense the muscles in your finger at all when doing a fingerspin then the yoyo will spin out.  I see it more as a dead finger than anything because I do everything I can not to put any effort into holding my finger up if that makes sense at all.  Also make sure to hold the string up so it doesnt touch the sides of the yoyo while it is on your finger otherwise it can get twisted up around your finger and instantly cause the yoyo to die.  ,Throwers,d6pxyjc,1,t5_2s97a

These same comments sort of apply for Alumigo Hard which is a material Sengoku has used for the Masamune.Materials are only part of it though the design has to take advantage of these properties and with thinner walls the machinist has to be on point.

9483041,0,t3_5akot8,I saw where you mentioned you need to straighten your arm out to achieve the rolling grind.  Youre correct and you should also bring your hand up higher so your arm is a lower incline for the yoyo.  That will make it easier for the yoyo to get a grip and roll up your arm. What you are doing here is technically a stall. But its a nice stall.. Things have changed a bit since I came up yoyoing. Im still getting used to the changes. This apparently is a grind.

You could have put too much lube in the bearing or simply not removed the shields. You also couldve used the wrong type of lighter fluid.

No one has flamed me for my newb questions and I really appreciate the guidance. I went with the Czech point. You were right pretty much every review most people say they like the Czech better than the Shutter. A few YoYoers on YouTube actually said it was likely their all around favorite.I would say I like Paul Kerbels style over Gentry but my favorite would probably be Grant Johnson. He has a certain style that just stands out to me albeit hes not as perfect as some of the winners Ive watched. I have another question how long do you think it takes to start getting a bit better? Like to the point where I would be able to freestyle at least? Every time I feel like I am getting somewhere I see string tricks that feel overwhelming. Is there a point of practice after about  months to a year where it just clicks? Just curious. ,Throwers,dbsonxn,1,t5_2s97a

General consensus is a lot of people doing it wrong and other people taking those peoples words for it. Watch some videos on how to do it right and only lube when necissary.

10211045,0,t3_5m7say,Its possible that the bearing is dirty that could make it go responsive. Depending on how new it is its possible that the bearing is still just breaking in and you can play it until it goes back to being unresponsive. Its also possible that its just fine and youre snagging the string on the response somehow and getting it to return. How long have you had the yoyo?

10363488,0,t1_dchwv6a,Yeah I understand the flop will turn because if the yoyo spinning.  What I didnt understand is what action to the spinning yoyo to cause it to flop. I started out thinking that the string rub to on side will cause dissimilar spin on both halves this the flop. It did happen but the spin totally slow down quickly. What it really need to happen is a pull difference of a string width from the string loop end and the string wrap end. I wouldnt have guess that the offset pull between strings side by side is enough to cause it to flop but it does,Throwers,dcirh57,1,t5_2s97a

11290994,0,t3_60xq38,Taxation is huge. Also import costs since Japan doesnt produce a lot of its OWN materials. Also the focus on perfection can be a problem. Im not sure if this is  accurate but yoyoers Ive talked to in Japan say that you dont normally see many if any bgrades I can attest to this because selling something thats seen as imperfect is a sign that not only do you produce lessthanperfect products but you would try to push it off on the customer even discounted. I think thats a silly way to think since my NQP Kuntosh is one of the best yoyos I own but whatever. ,Throwers,dfbtga1,1,t5_2s97a

11364929,0,t1_dfjzyxv,In that case a Kuntosh may be a good choice. It is angular not rounded and is .x.mm. Its a great yoyo. The Vanguard Benchmark V or H and Terrarian are also more angular shapes so you can look at those. I do think its worth trying some organic rounded shapes but you can always get more later. Different yoyos will fit your budget depending on what colors you want for example a solid color Kuntosh is  new while a splash color is . You can also always check out the BST and you can get a deal on some used yoyos. Theres a lot of good stuff there.,Throwers,dfk6yn7,2,t5_2s97a

11667526,0,t3_66hndv,People say that but I fundamentally disagree.  Yes competition tricks are competition oriented but there is tons of variety.  Look at cal states.  The top three were Ferdico Keiran Nate Dailey... Those are three super different styles! Look at the most recent WYYC.  Finalists included Shion Zach Gentry Takeshi Ahamad Kharisma Yusuke Otsuka etc.  Tons of different styles.  If anyone wants to complain about style getting too competitiony then they need to justify their opinion against all of those IMO. Competition tricks are getting to competitiony is kinda a tautology.  Yes the rule systems that we impose influences the types of tricks we see but if the rule set allows Gentry and Takeshi to do well I cant really claim that it is unreasonably constricting the possible styles.  Beside the point most people do not compete.  This doesnt effect the average player.  If you are just playing for fun the scoring system doesnt affect you.,Throwers,dgij2nd,6,t5_2s97a

11699273,0,t1_dgm26p0,Hrmm.... I mean its basically a Magic Drop except you do the magic but dont drop it...I just did it and two things that I noticed were  as the yoyo goes around your TH you bring your hands closer together so that theres enough string to allow the yoyo to go over your NTH and  I think you maintain tension in the string for a little bit longer than if you were doing just a magic drop. Think of it from a physics standpoint  you want the yoyo to be traveling horizontally across your body so you want to remove all forces acting on the yoyo when its directly over your TH so that its velocity vector is pointing primarily towards your left. Hopefully that makes some sense and is helpful... Its probably a little confusing to think about hahaha.,Throwers,dgm4qg1,1,t5_2s97a
