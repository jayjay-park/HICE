206203,0,t1_cf1w02f,Good advice here thanks for the reply. Ive benefitted from both exercise and meditation before...I used to do trail jogging in the woods a lot...it was definitely the best way to naturally get to a better place mentally. Youre right about the zone...its there if I work for it and catch it at the right time. I was able to work on some stuff kratomfree yesterday and it went better than I expected. Nothing mind blowing but it was evidence to my brain that kratom is not essential in the studio...it was helpful but never essential. Thanks again the feedback Im getting here helps me fine tune my perspective on things. I cant view a struggle as such a negative thing. Its just life and I need to work through it. ,quittingkratom,cf1xht3,1,t5_2xty7

Even though the cruddiness is back it was a moment of clarity that made this whole ordeal seem like a necessary part of my growth and the true step in making peace with my former relationship. Thank you so much.Im at about  hours cold turkey.

847659,0,t1_cgzxsu8,Not trying to nitpick but Tagamet actually only slows down the metabolism of Immodium and perhaps Kratom I dont know. It does this by reducing stomach acid and inhibiting certain liver enzymes. Immodium is kept out of the brain by something called Pglycoprotein and to overcome it you need a PGP inhibitor like quinine or quinidine. However this is a very bad idea because Immodium forms an extremely toxic metabolite in the brain similarly to MPTP notorious for causing permanent Parkinsons disease in junkies who injected contaminated batches of pethidine. Ive read one anecdotal account of someone who took Immodium with a PGP inhibitor and developed a lasting tremor in his jaw. Not good.tldr TagametImmodium is safe but dont go looking for ways to make Immodium cross the blood brain barrier!,quittingkratom,ch0mst9,2,t5_2xty7
933115,0,t3_24svrt,Youve already come a long way Going from  tsp to . is no small feat so congrats. If youve gotten this far you can handle what remains. The low end of a taper is always the hardest so take it nice and slow. If you need to be fully functional during the day dont drop one of your three doses entirely. For one thats a big drop in your total dose percentagewise and for another Kratom has a short halflife so if you spread your doses out you wont have as many ups and downs.So Id suggest sticking with your dose schedule but taking slightly less than  tsp at each dose. Continually reduce each dose but go as slowly as you need to. As long as you continue moving in this direction youll eventually reach your goal. If you have a day or two without much you need to do try going temporarily cold turkey. Then when you jump back on you should find that youre able to get by with less so youre accelerating your taper basically. See the wiki of this subreddit for advice on feeling better during the taper.Also if you have a free week you might want to consider just jumping off. Youre at a point where the WDs shouldnt be too bad. A lot of people here will tell you that for them going cold turkey ended up being easier than tapering. But by all means you can succeed with this taper as long as you stick with it and take your time.Edit Your biggest difficulty will not be getting through the withdrawal. Instead it will be staying clean if thats what you intend to do. After  years of use Kratom has become your default coping mechanism source of pleasure etc. If you want to stay off the stuff you need to get a head start on learning how to live differently. Dont view it as a battle though. See it as a journey.,quittingkratom,chaclwe,4,t5_2xty7

I normally do cardio and weights. Admittedly the weights is a bit more difficult due to aches and such in my shoulders so I dont push it too much. Ill be dropping it cold turkey at the  gram mark.

1754788,0,t3_2ejn8x,Like the others have said herbal remedies can certainly help soothe the frayed nerves. In addition to ashwaganda valerian kava etc you may look into tulsi holy basil Melissa officinalis lemon balm and skullcap. These are herbal adaptogens and work to decrease ones sensitivity to stress. I am still having trouble eating too Day   losing weight and it is starting to worry me. But licorice root brewed into tea is tasty and soothes the stomach also helps to make the other herbs more palatable if drinking them in a tea. Personally I like to consume both tea and medicinal tinctures. Taking kratom became a ritual in our lives. We can replace that ritual with something like brewing and drinking a nourishing tea. Something that helped me when I felt like I wanted to crawl out of my skin was to sit down and create some art. Creating mandalas painting sketching... whatever. The act of creating brought temporary relief by distracting my mind from the feelings in my body. Journaling through my recovery process has proven to be invaluable as well. Keep moving forward.

Its still not all the way gone for me but I only get insomnia a couple times a week when before it was constant.  One of the only things that would help me sleep in the first few weeks was to physically exhaust myself to the point of where I didnt think I could go any further.  Hiking  miles in the mountains with a  pound pack on my back.  I ended up losing almost  lbs while quitting kratom.  Luckily I have gained it all back as I am too thin to be losing weight.  Stick it out  it should start getting better real soon. ,quittingkratom,ckob2rj,2,t5_2xty7

2362298,0,t1_cm3ethl,Ive tried cold turkey once when I had been taking near an ounce a day.  It was the worst restless leg syndrome Ive ever had from quitting.I know how hard it is to discontinue use when you have concurrent mood issues.  I do believe after awhile kratom makes the concurrent disorder worse.  It used to work by completely taking away my anxiety cravings for other drugs and made me motivated to work hard.  Now it seems to hurt me more than it helps overall.You should consider finding a therapist or addiction specialist.  Honest discussions with my therapist and their advice is helping.  Instead of avoiding my feelings this time and just substituting my addiction with being busyobsessive Im instead trying meditate on my feelings and develop a new relationship with them.

We threw kratom and phenibut out two nights ago. I had an arsenal of valium and etizolam but didnt take any so I was trying to ride out the anxiety and depression as best as I could. The past three days though I started a stack which seems to be working great. I take ashwagandha bacopa and Gotu kola. These three herbs are amazing anxiolytics. I also found agmatine very useful. The only thing that I still have going on is some lingering anxiety fatigue rls and demotivation. Im hoping these will clear up soon but I notice a major improvement over the past  days.

For someone like me who has been using it for about  years straight the physical withdrawals last over a week. I dont sleep AT ALL for  days in a row. Thats just the physical stuff.

3104861,0,t3_2vo2zu,Agreed! Having it in the house or easy access is dangerous. If your serious get rid of it. Speaking from experience you WILL probably take it at some point. Rid yourself of anything that may trigger you wanting to use. Call your vendors and ask them to cancel your account. Do what ever it takes. Yes you probably spent a lot of money on it.

3195032,0,t3_2wppex,I think the specific question you raise is really important and an issue at the core of any addiction. And you describe the lurking attachments and mental feelings of that attachment to the idea of use even occasional exactly like I experience. Many deep aspects of the whole dependency complex are common human condition. Like you I have tapered down to to g a day and am feeling much improvement but I am not there yet to the point where I can let go the plant and close the door despite overwhelming evidence and experience life is better without it. I dont know how to that full let go point either its a deep rooted attachment and feels sometimes will takes something bordering on a miracle to shake. I feel humans have some sort of subtle inner light or energy and kratom dampens. Not to say as a cliche but because when I lower and quit taking it I truly feel some kind of real lightenergy inside starts to turn back on. Cells vibrate and then hum brain starts to work different in a good alive awy. Motivation returns  creativity returns  healthy interests return  as if the whole system of healthy balanced human being slowly starts flowing back in again energy is flowing. Not sure how else to describe it. Human is like a plant that radiates its own sunshine to nourish itself and taking krat or other opi instead covers it with shade. Look what happens to plant in heavy shade. It wilts goes lackluster not does well. Take away shade to put in sunshine again and it restores to natural vibrancy. Thats my experience stopping this or any other substance like an subtle inner sunshine turns back on. Even dropping to g I am noticing this turning back on again. Why I still have attachment to want to be able to go back to it why it has taken so many times this is some kind of madness for that I have not yet answer. ,quittingkratom,cot5y8e,2,t5_2xty7

You havent been using too long so it might not be too bad that being said it varies from person to person. Try not to focus on how long it is taking. It WILL get better.

You realized after a couple weeks that it was a good tool to quit Oxys but that you dont want to get addicted to the kratom now. I used kratom to get off heroin and just stayed on the kratom for a year. With your short duration of use and kratoms dissimilarities to oxycontin I think you should be decently in the clear. There should be minimal case of crosstolerance leading to crosswithdrawal. There may be a slight overlay but I think the worst part will actually come from the PAWS of that  year oxy habit. ,quittingkratom,cqx8rw8,2,t5_2xty7

I am definietly not at the point where if I take one I need more but I know thats how it starts! I feel like I have enough willpower now to stop that shit dead in its tracks thankfully! Thank you so much! It really does help to hear this because it was a huge struggle and I know things are easier now but this sub helped me get through the worst part of it! Im glad your progress has been improving too! Keep it up! D,quittingkratom,cs1axiz,1,t5_2xty7

4370745,0,t3_3b17g0,Nice to wake up to a small but mighty support group for lack of a better description.yes crux...life on lifes terms...that really is the challenge.  The people I know who do this well have also been good at making life work for them...enough money enough people knowing their limits and keeping risks to a minimum.  I have always been the sort who jumps in first and then sees the pitfalls...always been the sort to act first think later and to take big leaps for the moon.   This has its benefits but also can make for chaos.  I think a big part of Life on Lifes terms for me is owning that I am at the Helm of my Life....and I can create stability love friendship affluence...all the things Ive ever wanted if I just reach out even a little and sincerely ask for help.  Life has really felt too hard for me....And support is the balm that I forget to apply that makes it all so much easier.Oh Jen yes I have read everything youve written here I think.  Youve got it down and I love your determination to outwit the trickster K.  I never even heard of Agmatine which is saying something since I basically have a PhD in neurotransmitterholistc health.  I have used stem and vein in the past to deal with nighttime wds and I like it.  I am going to order some soon after I stabilize on the much less stimulation I am adjusting to from no adderall or white vein...the step down method.  And start all of the nutrition today.Does anyone else have trouble taking a million supplements?  I KNOW they work...it seems easy enough when Ive got them all on hand and yet I look at the bottle of Ltyrosine to vit c or whatever and I feel sick and tons of resistance to actually taking them.  never could figure that out.  Doesnt matter....greatest tagline of all time....Just Do It.And Birdie you actually bring a tear to my eye....and thats saying something since I feel my heart is cold. I wrote my thesis on beliefs and the power of them oops..i better be careful....this could be giving away too much identifying info.  The mind is everything and the brain enables the mind....so its our most important organ.  Im just happy that the universal forces threw you at me this year....I understand you and respect you and for me thats so important to accept support.  As soon as someone starts throwing some jargon at me or religiosity I go right back to my old friends K A X....they never try to change me...just accept and love me as I am while making me feel better.  I know this is not a healthy outlook on receiving support but its how I am.  I will fight to the death for my freedom...even if it means killing myself and allowing my life energy to be sucked out of me.  So thanks for your complete and utter acceptance and seeing me and my strengths without mitigating them by my weaknesses...thats the golden ticket.    Ok up and at em on day  of my Begin to End program  Observation and RegulationAdding Supplementation.Thank you.  ,quittingkratom,csibglz,2,t5_2xty7
4412215,0,t1_csmxd5e,You know I dont think its smart to leave it like that. Im not a relationship counselor but I know I would speak up about it if I knew my partner was doing something like that. A partnership has to be a two way street and honestly if she were hooked on something Id rather her at least not try to hide it. For me though the secrecy is worse than the drug habit. You can get through breaking a habit together but secrecy can kill relationships. We love who we do for better or worse... but opiate addiction can be a living hell while youre in it for a long time. Once the habit builds up and the euphoria melts away all youre left with is a fear of the withdrawals and an emotionallydulled person wishing to be able to be happy again. By telling him you know and you know what it is... and that theres help out there... opiate addiction is like a prison. You might be doing him an amazing favor by helping him get free! I think to be fair to yourself and him you should say something but gently. Its never fun to feel like youve been found out but if yourre honest about how it makes you feel it might go a long way. ,quittingkratom,csmzp48,1,t5_2xty7

4607970,0,t3_3e3x23,They are similar but for me oxyh was much more of a full body shutdown.  Especially stomach issues.  Kratom is much more psychological and DEFINITELY more anxiety inducing.  The waves of anxiety with kratom were way more profound than oxy wd.  On the plus side Ive barely had any gastro issues with quitting kratom for some reason.Overall Id say oxyh was worse but then again I was on a much higher dose.  But that doesnt make kratom any less fun to quit.  I like the analogy of getting hit by a car is much more painful than getting punched in the face but both suck dick.,quittingkratom,ctbf2ib,1,t5_2xty7
4642436,0,t3_3ek9ub,Oh lord Suboxone. Take that as absolutely scarcely as possible man. Theres a reason its considered massively addictive despite its intended use of helping users. Its halflife is incredibly long ranging from  to  hours. Because it activates opiod receptors for such a huge amount of time the withdrawal from it is extended accordingly. The worst effects of Kratom withdrawal last about a week where as the worst of a bad suboxone withdrawal will last a month or longer.Granted do I think Subs are completely bad? Not at all. Theyve saved many lives from heroinhard opiate addictions. They enable addicts to function normally and prevent them from the severe withdrawal which could result in stealing overdosing suicide etc. I just wish doctors would explain how immensely careful patients need to be with the drug instead of just heres your prescription take as needed have a nice day!,quittingkratom,ctfqu0s,2,t5_2xty7

4824268,0,t3_3gwkqr,Hey there good for you for making the decision.  Its more than half the battle.  I had some scary symptomstoo in fact I just made a post about what my symptoms were.I am convinced kratom IS toxic for some of us.  I think it severely fucks with our hormonesI forgot to add the loss of my hair my left eyebrow would diminish each time Id return to kratom after trying to quit it.I am an all or nothing gal too.  No way in hell I can taper but I admire those who CAN.  I tried several times and my hand would toss out my regular dose on the scale even though it was time to go lowervery strange.Hey I am convinced that kratom was triggering a case of hypothyroidism and adrenal fatigue in me.  Google the symptoms for that and see if they match your circumstanceswere you SUPER cold a lot? I have had really good luck treating it with a few things.I take daily ashwagandha toobecause it helps to speed heal the receptors.  But there is a kind that is far superior to plain powderlook into KSM ahswagandha..supposed to be the best and most potent available.Send me a PM if you would like to know the other  things that Ive used to eradicate the hypothyroid symptoms I was having my eyebrows are perfectly fine now.It could be that just stopping kratom itself could help.but I am one of those lets throw everything at it people..my energy levels are back up and I am feeling AWESOME.As far as the MJ is concerneddifferent strains have different effects.  Google which strains are best for sleep some are energetic and it could be you have one of those.  I used MJ very successfully to sleep and had absolutely NO RLSGood luck !  I have a sneaking suspicion that youll wake up feeling SO MUCH better today..if not today tomorrow.  Then things will keep on getting better amp better.  The symptoms that DO remain will be ghost versions of the acutes.They may nag you but be rest assured they WILL go away they have for everyone I know so far and I have been studying this kratom WD issue for well over a year now and have talked to TONS of people !.PEACE OUT amp hang in there !,quittingkratom,cu2mziw,2,t5_2xty7
4853831,0,t3_3h70go,I think the biggest issue with Kratom is awareness or lack therefore of. Everybody wants to blame extracts for kratoms imminent bansdemise but I think thats bullshit as extracts have been around since damn near day one dating waaaay back SSs x like  years ago. I think people saying that kratom wds are similar to caffeine wds is WAY more damaging to kratom than extracts. When you tell someone who is desperate to feel the effects of an opiate that they can do so and only feel wd effects that are similar to caffeine when you quit people arent going to go out and search for other opinions theyre going to blindly accept what they heard about it being a piece of cake to quit because they want to hear that. I wanted to hear that! I loved hearing that and believing that and I naively regurgitated the same thing to others while I was actively using because I had never quit and didnt want to believe it would be difficult to do whenever that time came. As far as I am concerned kratom is an opiate. Ive experienced real opiate wd and Kratom wd and kratom wd kicked my ass the first time I went through it and its kicking my ass right now albeit not as intensely. After I CTd the first time I realized how much bullshit was happening across the internet and I finally searched for other opinions and was shocked at the horror stories about wd that were out there when you actually looked for them but was also relieved to know that I wasnt alone. Now I never tell people the falsities of kratom that I once did I tell them my honest first hand experiences.I do believe SOME people can evade kratoms wds but its rare. Ive known people who can use opiates without much discomfort when quitting but I think that comes down to a physiological level which I just do not understand well enough to speak on.,quittingkratom,cu6d105,1,t5_2xty7

4968971,0,t3_3iwhup,I agree with the selfprescribed part because I do think most people tend to take whats suggested to them without thoroughly researching these supplements first.  Even nutriants like Vitamins A and K are fatsoluable and can build up in your body in excessive amounts that can be toxic.  Furthermore supplements are not evaluated by the FDA so there is not a ton of information out there regarding them.  There are studies on most though so like I said each one should be THOROUGHLY investigatedno matter how safe they seem to be.That said I do think that switching one addiction for another is actually a good thingat least temporarily.  I mean instead of trying to change ones behavior right off the bat which is VERY difficult to do why not utilize the addicts addictive nature for good and then slowly they can learn to change their behavior.  I think becoming addicted to exercise and nutritian is a great alternative for a malnurished and unhealthy addict.  On the other hand I do advise against using most medications because those are unnecessary especially with kratom withdrawal.  Medication for people withdrawing from hard opiates may be required but generally people tend to survive opiatekratom withdrawal without any health complications.  Many people swear by adderall gabapentin benzos adrafinil clonodine or whatever and I will agree that they all help to some extent but theyre not worth the risk of getting addicted to in the longrun.  Thats why I think its okay to use supplementsespecially during withdrawal when your body is completely distraut trying desperately to achieve a homeostatic state.  You just have to be absolutely sure that you know everything about each supplement you are taking and how they interact with each other etc.  But youre right you could always ask a doctor if you needed to.  By the way congratulations on your recovery.  Im happy for you.  Take care.,quittingkratom,cukvjnb,2,t5_2xty7

I have never said Clean and sober anywayI live in an MJ legal area and have zero real problems with puffing it once in a great while.but kratom sent me right back into addiction mode .I find that supplements helped me but didnt eliminate the paws phase.  It was certainly not as bad as the acute stages.  You were VERY close to being free at  weeks..The only advice would be to look into supplements ask questions around the symptoms you are having the worse time with they vary greatly here for instance I never even get RLS at all and never have in all  cold turkeys Ive done.Post amp read here..TONS of great support.and good luck.  You can absolutely do this.  Put the knowledge that youve made it  weeks already to good use EDIT TO ADDSome of those were week breaks but many were failed QUIT attempts foiled for the same reason you gave in.

5177715,0,t3_3lu7r0,Think of it like this  if you were to take  single bag of heroin per day or  vicodins per day you probably wouldnt get addicted either.  However does that mean that heroin and vicodin are not addictive?  Try taking triple or quadrupal that dose and you will surely get addicted.  Its the same with kratom.  While some people have huge tolerances and can get away with not getting addicted to g per day I guarentee that if you doubled or tripled that dose you would get addicted.  For others tolerance is low and they dont need as much to form a physical dependency.  I just jumped off of  grams per day after relapsing for about a month and my withdrawals are VERY similar to fullblown opiate withdrawals.  My best friend takes your dose and doesnt get withdrawals at all.  Its all a matter of whether you have reached your threshold of tolerance or not.,quittingkratom,cva3rsf,1,t5_2xty7

5237751,0,t3_3mqw4n,Personally Id just sit through the pain because Im so fucking done with opiates but its up to you. I dont know how bad your pain is. Youre further along than me. Im on day  but I managed to severely injure myself twice now in the past  days to the point where I limp when walking sometimes. Im sitting through the pain right now.In my experience hydrocodone and oxycodone at the very least subdued my kratom withdrawals when I was prescribed them in the past which leads me to believe they will undo some progress but Im not a pharmacologist. I believe they bind to the mu opioid receptor like kratom but kratom may also do other things too. Also hydrocodone and oxycodone only ever helped me with certain types of pain. They rarely took my mind off a sprained ankle but they did relieve all the chest pain I have from GERD.I dont know if anyone can say with certainty whether it will impede your kratom kick progress since kratom is so understudied in the west.

5298688,0,t1_cvoy9qv,That is inspiring with your history. I do believe exercise is so important.

Then reduce as you see fit.  Hopefully get down to about g or less per day and abandon ship at any point after that.If you dont cheat and thats key you should feel almost no acute wds.

I have been suffering through addiction for a long time and have never had to leave my home or find a dealer. There are a lot of addicting easily obtainable substances on the net it makes it too easy to be a closet addict. The longer I use and the more things in my life that are negatively affected from Kratom the more guilt I endure when trying to get through detox and recovery. Its a viscous cycle.

It feels relatively similar to booze except way cleaner no making you feel dumb and inebriated and no hangover to speak of. People compare the feeling to a muscle relaxant  a benzo. Im not a drinker but I actually like this stuff. Its very clean and mild and helped me a shit ton when I needed a break from the constant nagging anxiety and general shittiness. It didnt affect the withdrawal negatively at all just cut a bunch of the worry and made me talkative and happy again for a night here and there and then put me to sleep.

5653753,0,t3_3sjw62,Day  jumper I tried to taper and it was going well because I wanted to make my final order last as long as possible but in the end I was buying very expensive headshop stuff and taking at least  grams a day. The kratom I had was bottom of the barrel stuff at that point so it was kind of a taper. I think anyone who feels like they need to taper meaning you want to quit and can stick with their plans of reduced doses is in a much better place than someone like me who will impulsively dose  or more  pills get the shakes and feel like crap because of it both mentally and physically.  Your resolution is commendable and you can probably safely get through the final streach. As others have said g a day is so low you probably will not suffer nearly as much as you think. There will always be some reason to move the final date back a bit longer and from an addicts point of view they are all excellent reasons.  I once read that the best time to quit smoking is on a great vacation because your brain chemistry is going to provide elevated levels of happyness on a great vacation. If you are like me having family for the hollidays would also be cause for elevated happiness so maybe that would help you with the PAWS?

If you mix that with kratom wd I would personally give in and get something to cheer me up and give me energy. The other stuff may be dangerous to take if yiu are not in a good mental place your mindset can have a drastic outcome on your trip. That being said you can also ise them to gain insight on things that are bothering you like a kratom addiction. This kind of trip may not be a fun night out but it can have the kind of effect that will make you never do kratom again.

Take into consideration Ive had sleeping issues since I was a little girl so I think most people bounce back quicker than I did. I hope that helps. As far as the exercise goes just go at the pace you are comfortable with. Maybe try some exercise in the morning before you start your regular routine? Just a thought.

I think everyone reacts differently..Ive seen some people claim caffeine withdrawals were nightmarish so..for people that have quit heroin and harder drugs kratom is on the lighter side of things,quittingkratom,czc0qtq,1,t5_2xty7

Still seems like a long time so sorry   Check your Hylands bottlebox when I took that it was to be taken several times per day not just at night. Getting it in your system throughout the day may help. If you dont get relief soon I would seek some professional help. Some people unfortunately do suffer from RLS wo cause. Keep us posted I hope you get some sleep soon you definitely need that for recovery.

6386815,0,t1_czfljul,I think that you are right in that kratom withdrawal is no joke. However I believe that kratom addiction doesnt cause severe negative effects on peoples lives in the same way that harder drugs do hence me classing it in its own way. Dont get me wrong it can affect peoples lives but it just doesnt cause the same amount of damage as some other substances. Does this make kratom abuse ok? Of course not.This has to do with the facts that kratom presents It is legal it is cheapplain leaf it cannot kill youOD it has a limiting mechanism built in to it so you can only really get high once a day if your tolerance is high enough and it doesnt hit the opiate receptors very hard.I think all of these factors combined put kratom on a different level but this is just from what I have gathered from personal experience and seeing other people battling addictions to other drugs.,quittingkratom,czfm4h1,1,t5_2xty7

6577421,0,t3_45qqzr,Make sure that one or more people who care about you know about your kratom use. Tell them what you told us and add that you are concerned because you have heard from others that the negative effects are usually noticed by others before they are noticed by the indivual taking kratom. Then ask the other persons to please keep an eye on you and let you know if they notice changes in your personality memory level of interest in things you usually are interested in.  Do that stick to the amount you are using and you might be ok in the short and medium terms. Its also likely however that you will reach that point at which kratom ceases to relieve pain or give you energy. If you reach that point of tolerance your dose will serve only to get you back up to normal. If that occurs many people report it occuring anywhere between  months to a year then its probably best to quit. I have known people who have not struggled with addiction in the past but who became addicted to kratom because of how tolerance seems to build up so rapidly.  To my knowldege nobody has done research on what kind of longterm effects kratom has. Its possible that a year of moderate use will have no adverse longterm consequences over the course of a lifetime. But I dont think anyone can say anything conclusive on that question at this point. Good luck to you. Im sorry you have been dealing with such pain and I hope your healing progresses and ultimately leads you to a place even better than before. ,quittingkratom,czznqn4,1,t5_2xty7

For me personally that just isnt possible.  I couldnt do it with pain pills in the last year and I couldnt successfully do it with kratom although I did try on both. I waited about  weeks after going off kratom and felt pretty normal and thought I could just casually use it. It started off with once or twice a week with out issue. One time a week wasnt enough to cause me withdrawals but unfortunately the use just kept occurring more and more until it was back to daily use and now here I am again on kratom going through the withdrawals a second time.   I personally know people who can recreationally use opiates and other substances like kratom with out issue but Im Definetly not one of them. If youve got the will power to do it more power to you buddy. When I was in my early s I never knew what withdrawals were.   I remember using whatever I wanted for some times a month at a time with out the slightest issue but now Im in my early s and those days are gone.  Just a week on kratom and im in hell for a week after the use stops..  Recreational use just isnt possible for some people myself included.

Now that Im tapering I can just remove one capsule from a dose each week and continue until Im down to nothing at all.  While this involves buying a capsule maker and capsules youll realize it is worth it when you can really control your dose.  Plus it tastes a hell of a lot better than tea andor Toss amp Wash.  Heck in just  weeks time Ive gone from  caps   cap doses in a day down to    cap doses in a day and its been super easy.

At least it has been for me not only purely for the brain boost but what it does to my whole psyche. I still wake up in the morning when I dont have kratom and miss it and its not like Im at the gym first thing. But every day I go I spend a good hour listening to music and really enjoying myself not paying attention to what time it is or what else I have to do plus seeing positive changes in my body over time. It is without a doubt my  positive change and it was previously when I kicked opiates the first time around.If you can not do kratom and go to the gym just for today and you dont even have to go every day you should work in some offdays then you can wake up tomorrow and do the same.

6999268,0,t1_d19ojr5,Yeah highCBDlowTHC weed helped me a lot with the depression and anxiety from quitting kratom. Fortunately I was able to recently quit that too with the help of my doctor Be careful with phenibut and tianeptine. Phenibut can be highly addictive and withdrawals can be on par with benzos or alcohol... dangerous without medical intervention. Tianeptine too can be dangerous. If you use it dont go above mg per dose. I hear if you go into the mg per dose range the withdrawal is comparable to Fentanyl due to its short action.Personally I used Ashwagandha exercise MJ SAMe and phenibut once or twice to combat withdrawal the first time.The second time I went cold turkey and did something kind of crazy  I kept myself hopped up on psychedelics for three days straight. I do not recommend this! I eventually went back to weed and finally quit it again about  days ago. I am nearly  days off KratomAnother great one is getting sunlight like you observed... and coloring!

Im also a business owner and found that while kratom could help make the tedium of mundane tasks or projects less excruciating it ultimately robbed me of my innovation problem solving abilities short term memory and just a general awareness of what my company needed and where it should be going. It was like I was running it on autopilot. It took me over twenty years to build it up to where it was when I became a daily kratom user two years ago and in that time I managed to let it deteriorate significantly. What a waste! If you dont mind me asking did you participate in the Ayahuasca ceremonies with the intent of using them to help address your kratom dependency?

8799637,0,t1_d75jyf2,This is kind of shameful to admit but I have found that during my taper I am less into my kids than while maintaining my habit. They dont make me as happy they seem like more of a chore it seems like every second one of them needs something from me  milk a ride homework help  etc and it is easy to get impatient. I have realized after multiple seizures that I REALLY need to focus on getting myself better that has to be my absolute first priority or Im not going to ever be any good to any of them. I have a teenager a first grader and a preschooler so they all have different  needs and it doesnt ever seem like I get a moment to myself. The teenager has definitely noticed somethings up and I feel like shit about it. Hes cared for me after a couple of the seizures Ive had and eventually I will level with him as to the cause of those seizures. The younger two are oblivious and sometimes it is all I can do to just let them climb all over me and make like its the best thing ever even when I wish that every human being in the world would just leave me alone. All I want to do is go to bed at night and the endless diapers and potty training and do a craft with me and all of that is really really really tiring. I do what I can and feel like shit about it but they really are my inspiration to get better so theres that. Snuggles help but I am definitely not the patient gogetter mom that I was when I was at higher doses.

8931133,0,t1_d7ldh6c,Thats what Im thinking too doing the final drop off on a Thursday. So Ive found quite a few things. Blue Lotus Flower tea has been really helpful so far on my first day after a drop in dosage. I dont think this is what its intended for but Ive found that its soothing and takes away some of the jitters. The supplier I used to buy my kratom from online sells a lot of these products. They sent me a sample bag in my last batch of kratom I bought from them of something that has Ashwagandha extract cats claw red Chinese ginseng graviola and gotu kola. I did some brief research on all of them and theyre basically just homeopathic herbs or roots. I tried some in a tea and it seriously helped. Im sure I cant mention the supplier or their name for the mixture sorry. Also I bought a big bottle of Valerian Root and some melatonin these are sold at most stores I think. In small amounts the Valerian Root can be used for anxiety reduction during the day. Ive been taking  capsules of it at night to assist with sleep. Im finding that the day isnt too bad... its the night. Magnesium is another goto aid. Theres another vitamin supplier who sells a product that I really want to mention thats been a huge help. Basically it has HTP jujube seed vitamin D vitamin B valerian root and Ltryptophan all together. These are all amino acid or other types of standard overthecounter vitamins. This one in particular has been a huge help.,quittingkratom,d7le2d1,2,t5_2xty7

You should be seeing some improvements in your memory and cognition soon and also music appreciation should intensify.So many little improvements happened after like  days i was astounded because I never even realized how dull a lot of those things had gotten.I cold turkeyed too no choice as I lack selfcontrol and I worked every day except for   amp .

I was doing good without it so idk what possessed me to add it into my other supplements.

I am in no hurry but then again I just want to get this behind me and be who I used to be.  I have been forcing myself to get up and stay busy all day wether its cleaning or shopping or whatever and that definitely makes the time go by much faster.

Hes almost a month out and has forgotten what is going on over here. I cared for him  as I ALWAYS do during his wd. Feed him hot tea meds clean bed etc. Yesterday  things happened that stopped me in my tracks.  he called at lunch and saidsince the ban is cancelled you can continue with Kratom as long as we dont spend  a month. Huh? Wtf?  he came home and I wasnt all smiles dinner was ready. I was getting shit done. He says I told you not to eat so much  of that shit!  kratom You need to figure this out! Really?

Sure I would like it to be over quick as his was but someone has to run the house. I cant do it CT. I cant believe he is acting like that. Fuck it. I will do me as usual. I am not tempted to remain on Kratom in any fashion. I will do this like I do everything else by myself. I am hoping to stablize FOR REAL today.

I have continued to use piles of vitamins and feel sooo much healthier since I started them. My drops are taking longer for my body to adjust. I am not gonna slow down I am gonna go full steam to the end! I have noted some increased clumsiness evidenced by my ever increasing number of bruises. Also noticed an irritated brain feeling. Hard to explain. I have completely exhausted my brain of the feel good chemicals. It feels like a shell with absolutely nothing personalized in it. No me just an it. I knew I would get to the point that the enormous habit I had would show itself on this end of the journey. I am coloring playing soduko crosswords etc. Been researching herbs to assist in my journey after I jump and just for daily use to address pre Kratom issues. Have developed a tremor in my hands this is totally new. I am certain it neurological in origin God only knows what going on up there. Still fighting the good fight! I have  more Mondays of a g drop and I am going to take the plunge. I do have some mounting anxiety about it. Not so much worrying about the jump more concerned about who I will really be. yrz on opiates and I am not sure what I will discover.

A buzz only occurs when you take enough to increase your tolerance.Im not saying its not a life saver when you are critically depressed... thats good. Dont kill yourself. My partner tried about  months ago and were both still pretty screwed up from it.However you will have to pay the piper at some point. Instead I strongly recommend speak to a doctor or addiction specialist or both to treat the underlying depression. I also have personal experience with tianeptine and comorbid depression. Anything with opiate activity will eventually build tolerance and you will be depressed again and addicted again to boot. Get additional help before it is too late and you need even more help.

I am so glad that it has worked for you and totally understand that you want to share this positive experience with everybody.

I was thinking of making the jump this Thursday and have been taking about  g of vitamin C a day. Done that for the last two  three days. Do you think I have preloaded sufficiently or should I just modify my quit date Im pretty sure Im going to try the CT route so that I have fully prepared from a vitamin C standpoint? I will look up the protocol to get more information  is that a protocol that is specific to people with withdrawal symptoms or is it a general protocol? I just want to make sure that I use the correct search terms to pull up the correct information.Thank you so much for sharing your insight and contributing experiences and considerations that will help me in making my decision.

The moment I knew I had a problem was when I would wake up every night in a cold sweat and not be able to fall back asleep until I had taken more. This lead to an anxietydepression spiral of feeling trapped and hopeless. It crept up so slowly but in retrospect the warning signs were all there sneaking it around family having it stored at my now exgirlfriends place so I could take it before bed normalizing it with my friends.Im going to be off tomorrow and looking back on this year and how I essentially wasted it being stoned makes me want to cry.

9856927,0,t3_5ghrtd,The full answer is we dont know because not much scientific research has been done on kratom. But based on other things we know about other opiates  which kratom resembles  you body eventually develops a tolerance to the substance and you need more of it to get the same effect. The issue with kratom is taking more doesnt give you that effect because there are other alkaloids in kratom that prevent you from getting higher so you end up simply getting frustrated and feeling like a zombie Many people have taken various steps to combat this and try to reverse tolerance or get back to that best person you can be effect from kratom by taking things like DXM black seed oil grapefruit seed oil agmatine etc. Some of them work with various success rates but even if they work you will have to take several other substances to try to potentiateenhance or get back to the kratom magic but it doesnt really come back to the way it was in the beginning. It never does.Compared to other opiates though  the magic actually sticks around a lot longer with kratom. Thats because it does have the self limiting characteristic. It would be interesting to see if it could be reverse engineered and kinks worked out by some pharm company to make a kratom that works long term  thats controversial and a lot of folks on all sides of the kratom spectrum have a problem with that.,quittingkratom,dasdpnb,7,t5_2xty7

9914773,0,t3_5hg00v,I can speak for only myself but my two years with a kratom addiction has been an eyeopening one to say the least. I have discovered that I am an addict. I never knew this before. I thought I was a regular dude in my s that liked to party. If there was blow Id do it. Booze was a goto. Adderall was always fun. I loved dental work and the painkillers that lasted me  days...I thought this behavior was normal. I surrounded myself with people in college that acted the same way I did then went to culinary school and began working in highend kitchens and everything that Bourdain says about kitchens is true. I assumed this was the way people lived unless you were old or a loser. Then I met the most amazing girl in the world and her friends and coworkers....and I was amazed at how little these people dranksmokedcursedtecreationally did drugs all of it. It really got me out of that tiny sector I had been in for  years and made me analyze myself. During this time I realized I had a kratom problem and couldnt stop. Those guys over at rkratom are right...most of us here are the vast minority of kratom users. I know many many people that use kratom and can drop it no problem. I cant. I also cant drink one or two beers and call it a night. Ill drink every drop of booze in the fridge before I sleep. Anyway kratom helped me understand this about myself and hopefully I can make healthy changes to fix this behavior. Thanks guys.,quittingkratom,dazx2zo,3,t5_2xty7

10102577,0,t3_5kig60,Day . Got about  hours of sleep. I have been in a better mood than I have been for months. Exercise has fallen by the wayside for the time being and that sucks but I am trying to bring it back. The one major thing that keeps happening is this insane existential dread that I feel as soon as I wake up. The feeling of What am I doing with myself? What do I have to show for the last  years? There is no way my life can continue this way and make me fulfilled. Those thoughts slowly go away as I get going but will return throughout the day. My mind is preoccupied with thoughts of addiction and the loss of the love of my life about  of the time. If I didnt think of either of these things there is no telling what I could potentially achieve. But I cant just forget about either of these. That would lead to a really bad time and a future of mistakes that I really dont want or need to make. One day at a time week after week month into months and eventually years. I have to restructure my life and prioritize things in a way that will benefit me and in turn allow me to help those close to me and others that I havent even met yet. One of the things that stings no matter the context or state of mind I am currently in is the amount of lying I have done to cover this addiction. It came so naturally that it honestly scared me sometimes. It makes me feel almost sociopathic. The lies and mistruths would just come tumbling out of my mouth with zero effort or prior preparation. It is horrifying to think about that. The older I have gotten the more I have realized that a persons word is of the utmost importance and once someone loses the ability to trust another there is a long hard climb back to where you need to be. Ah the wonderful demoralizing yet very true introspective thoughts that years of lying and addiction bring to the table. It is very humbling and insightful in a shitty sort of way. ,quittingkratom,dbodmo1,2,t5_2xty7

They just started creeping in on my daily life with increasing frequency. I also noticed that I increasingly began to worry and feel gloomy about pretty much everything. I dont know how this stuff works but I reckon the kratom was taking over the pleasurewellbeing mechanisms of my brain. I cant imagine taking this stuff for years as some have indicated. My experience with kratom was only around  months and it really fucked with my headspace like nothing I have ever experienced before.

On the other hand I am selfmedicating with tianeptine and have not had a medical professional evaluate me for depression anxiety etc.. Im uninsured and dont have the money to see anyone about it.

Thankfully my symptoms have improved since I dropped my dose significantly. I have zero doubt its the Kratom. If I take a whole bunch at once my skin will break out. Why? What is it doing to me?

Flush it put it down the garbage disposal or my personal favorite pour it into the yard and hose it down until its mud.  The key here is to keep trying keep trying keep trying.  And I suggest making two lists . Reasons why you hate this goddamn plant and every single thing its done to ruin your life. . Things you can do differently in your day to day life to combat withdrawals and cravings including things you loved before kratom like walking meditating music cooking whatever.  This time tomorrow I want you to wake up and tell yourself This is it.  I am slamming the door on kratom and getting off this damn ride.  I am not looking back.

In my honest opinion you might want to consider leaping off of the Ativan and drinking. That combo alone is asking for problems since they potentiate each other and both of them are even moreso addictive and can both be fatal if you develop withdrawal symptoms from alcohol or benzos. Youve come this far without kratom it might be in your best interest to drop off everything completely. Drinking every day and popping benzos is way worse and can kill you too! Luckily you wont die from kratom withdrawals but the combos youre taking now most definitely can. Dont trade one addiction for another my man. Good luck.,quittingkratom,ddxbush,3,t5_2xty7

11057286,0,t1_del41xm,Oh I can see how that happens. I got really bad once I switched from the little . caps to kilos of loose leaf. And telling myself it wasnt addictive made it a freeforall allyoucaneat buffet thing. And I needed to perform at work to get those big bonuses so I needed the Kratom. And I had a seemingly endless supply in those kilos. Then I stocked up when talk of the ban came round meaning I had a LOT of Kratom on hand. So then if youre like me when you get your kilos you start using a teaspoon to measure doses instead of the caps. A couple teaspoons seems reasonable but then you heap em bigger and bigger. Who cares anyway cuz its like coffee right? Then maybe you drop your teaspoon in the big kilo bag and dont wanna fish it out cuz your place is starting to stink like Kratom already and fishing that teaspoon out will get your hand covered in green dust so you grab a regular spoon and start using that. Then it doesnt even work nearly as well anymore no matter how much you take. So maybe you run down the road get a kilo of another sort because you figure you simply have stagnant strain syndrome and you might as well have your dude fix you up some X extract caps and maybe top that purchase off with a few extract shots. Then when you go back to your plain leaf cuz the extracts are really pricey it REALLY doesnt work no matter which strain you use but you keep trying. And on and on it goes and gets worse and worse.

I want me new hair growing in to be free from it as much as I can. Maybe that sounds crazy but you just get to a point where youre so done. A point where you feel youll succeed no mater what. Anyways sorry I tend to ramble on. The dull life you talked about is exactly what its like being addicted to this plant for so long. It robs you of you life and being able to experience it. And I agree relate mostly with the irritability while being on kratom. I dont know if its a product of going through minor withdrawals or just a product of being on it for so long but how the hell can it make you a dull emotionless zombie but still enable you to get so pissed off at the drop of a hat?! Its infuriating and has never been a part of my character to do that. Thanks kratom for only letting us feel complete anhedonia and anger. Fun. Anyways man Im going through cold turkey as well. I can recommend rx and supplements if youre interested. Feel free to pm me anytime if you wanna bounce stories back and forth need to vent or need someone to keep ya honest. Were all in this together. ,quittingkratom,dfmso43,3,t5_2xty7

11541216,0,t3_64iyd1,With clonidine and lyrica I think you have a good setup. I used similar doses for over  years and those two seem to be a major helper for K WD. Im sure youre aware to check your BP with the clonidine due to its effects on blood pressure and carefulMixing it with black seed oil for same reason. I personally think a benzo for the two or three nights that are the worst and I had some bad nights going from such longterm use are nice to have in a drawer somewhere if needed. Never every day never more than a handful total not at once! Haha Just my experience but its doable totally doable. I did taper to g daily however. ,quittingkratom,dg475rj,1,t5_2xty7
11544428,0,t1_dg4jofa,I can understand that worry and impatience. Regulating doses is hard work and its easy to rationalize taking a bit more. I felt that impatience all throughout my withdrawals desperately wishing that it was already a few months down the road. I think I learned a hard lesson on how to be patient from my recovery.What is preventing you from going straight to cold turkey? Too much of a jump?,quittingkratom,dg4k9nh,1,t5_2xty7
11551396,0,t1_dg55qd0,Today has been rough to say the least. Dont get me wrong Ive never felt better mentally Ive done yoga eating a ton epson salt baths  times now rode the bike to community service went to AA MUSIC!!! Eminem always great for me at least being a slightly irritable white drug addict with a history of addiction. Took some vitamins ginseng b complex others I forgot. But where Im left is since I know Im an addict Ive actually have not smoke marijuana for  weeks all ready and Ill be honest my sponsee says its a no go all drugs are bad technically speaking valerian root or kava or ashwaganda root are also no go so its just a touchy subject I went from IV cocaine and heroin to kratom again then from g  times daily down to  g  times daily to dumping it all out and throwing everything away. Im craving release Ill be honest with you and myself.   Before I stopped smoking I stopped smoking during the days only nights. AA big book talks about drunks drinking at switching to beer from liquor. Man im over thinking but just expressing this is making me feel better. I just got this nagging rod with tension headaches. I would love to go to acupuncture tomorrow because Im tall and lengthy so I dont have the best posture .  If you check my past Reddit history Ive dabbled extensively in psychedelics LSD. DMT. Its def had its effects on my brain and I love how I perceive my life. But truth is I over analyze everything and I create my own problems.  There is no jared there is no jackzip. Just I Am.  But this is where I ask myself is the weed for therapeutic reasons or like I stated earlier I crave release its also the reason I went to meetings did yoga baths bicycling  so here I ask myself does the science behind it back it?

Luckily I didnt go back into full withdrawals just back to early paws phase which hopefully will get better quickly.

11613678,0,t1_dgc7r5j,I used every supplament mentioned here. Agmatine hylands resless legs bso tyrosine theanine maca etc. did not want to touch anything that would replace a bad habbit with a bad habbit like gabapentin or phen. I wish I could have smoked pot but I have to take random DOT tests. To be honest for the first week those supplaments were like a garden hose on a forest fire. However they help in PAWS which hit hard for me. I am still working my way through PAWS after  months although it is barely noticable mainly sleep disruptions and loose poo ans suseptability to colds. I drink Neene Kava  cup every night along with a beer or . Before bed I take  mg of Valerian tincture magneesium BSO and Hylands resless legs as I still get just a little restless in the middle of the night from time to time.Hot and humid is much better than a winter from hell to go through this. Plan on one month of PAWS formevery year of addiction. Many have talked about this and this has been the case for me for sure.,quittingkratom,dgcf52y,1,t5_2xty7

Kratom is indeed fucked up... but I guess when you think about the fact that we just ingested stuff that we have no idea where it came from we cant complain what happens  years later .

11651907,0,t1_dggqfb1,Thats really awesome that youve had the strength to limit yourself. It WILL help during the jump. I cut down a bit before jumping and I think it made a difference maybe put me a day or two ahead in the acute phase. Id recommend making the jump and getting it over with. Sounds like youre prepared! Might consider some restless legs from Hylands and some black seed oil to avoid phenibut. For me it was both Panic Attacks and GAD General Anxiety. For the most part less day  the anxiety has subsided more and more each day on  now. Sounds like you know what to expect the only unknown is how long which no one can tell you thats up to fate. Go forth and kick Kratoms tail out of your life!!! Once its out be proud of that no matter what day your on and stay very focused on the reasons you went through this and quit... remind yourself every morning as they start to feel clearer and clearer. Good luck!,quittingkratom,dggrapw,2,t5_2xty7

11671037,0,t1_dghsuqj,I think were in essential agreement about what kind of policy would be ideal education regulation of access quality control and public resources for evidencebased treatment of addiction. Where we differ is in our classification of drugs you contend that opiates and opioids are a special category requiring unusual restriction because of their unique allure and I dont. Heres why I dont. Research shows that the percentage of opiate and opioid users who become addicted is the same as the percentage of alcohol users who become addicted roughly ten percent. With alcohol we as a society have decided that ten percent is a figure we can live with so logically we should be willing to live with equivalent risk in drugs that are less physically harmful. Opiates are much less hard on the body than alcohol which damages every major organ from the brain to the kidneys and promotes a host of diseases including cancer stroke heart disease and diabetes. With opiates most of the danger results directly from the fact that they are illegal and from their demonization by drug warriors and irresponsible journalists.Take the case of opiates biggest danger overdose which happens because people  dont know the potency of what theyre taking  dont consider variations in their own tolerance and  dont understand the role of legal drugs in overdoses. All three of these factors are either caused or exacerbated by illegality and mythmaking. With  I wont insult your intelligence by explaining because its obvious. With  illegality is more contributor than cause. Addicts get arrested or or lose access to their supply and the enforced detox lowers their tolerance enough that their customary dose is now an overdose. But the really sneaky one is  because most of the opiate overdoses in the screaming headlines are actually polydrug fatalities involving alcohol benzos and increasingly acetaminophen. But AnheuserBusch and McNeil Consumer Healthcare would rather diewould rather YOU diethan allow this simple information to be disseminated.So yes Im one of your absolute nuts. I am because when heroin was legal in this country it caused much less misery crime death illness and other suffering than it does now. Heroin has no special unique allure to the general population thats a journalistic fiction. It has that allure for ME as Ill freely admit but I try really hard to take policy positions based on hard data.Its finding the data amid the vast oceans of bullshit thats the trick. Im lucky to have online access to a university library database so Im able to factcheck about as well as that can be done at the present moment.

11736059,0,t3_67gts3,Personally if it were me? Handle the kratom and give it a minimum of  days. You are only  days into your ct. All of us have that evening crash and crazy lethargy. This is paws type stuff and you are following the normal path or protocol as far as symptoms go.

Youre feeling pretty alone right now amongst everything else involved with seeking sobriety and happiness. All of us on the forum knows where you are right now. You have taken a big step towards being sane again. I will throw my two cents in though. Talking. Face to face admittance to someone who you love and trust will really help. It helps on so many levels. I was in the same spot where you are right now. I didnt think I could come fully clean with anyone out of fear of losing them forever. I finally did though and it was the best decision Ive made  next to quitting kratom. You can do this. You are a lot stronger at this moment than you have ever been in the last  years.,quittingkratom,dgw1y5g,6,t5_2xty7
