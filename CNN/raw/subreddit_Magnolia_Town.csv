3824198,0,t1_cqs5q9g,Kyro had nodded as Maxwell explained what the government office was and was intrigued since he hadnt ever seen oneI see... so your working for that office an gun... swordforhire of sorts?,Magnolia_Town,cqs6w8y,1,t5_37pcj
3832879,0,t1_cqt5rtq,Mip listened to her carefully and considered his other options. After a brief moment he looked the guild master in the eyes.I do I firmly believe I can be beneficial to this guild and make plenty of friends here.... no a family.Mip then shifted his attention to the glass of milk and hugged it with his paws and started to drink some more milk. Being satisfied with the milk he hugged the cold glass even tighter and started to move his tail much like dogs would do.,Magnolia_Town,cqt6jiy,1,t5_37pcj
3854454,0,t1_cqvbnql,Hole in my chest? Pff you wish you had enough power to hurt me like that.Michael said with a laugh. He shook his hand at the bandages not needing them. Besides a few bruises and maybe a small burn he was fine. Being a fire mage the burns didnt really bother him anymore.Anyway we should get back to town and get some sleep no?,Magnolia_Town,cqvn65v,1,t5_37pcj
3898039,0,t1_cr0kvas,She shrugs.Not sure but can you send it out for me?She strokes him with one hand while still holding the letter in the other hand.,Magnolia_Town,cr0lzen,1,t5_37pcj
3911512,0,t1_cr1qfil,Sounds like a plan. And awesome. Free is always nice.He gives her a shrug with a friendly smile. He wasnt quite sure what to expect. When they approached the derelict mansion his jaw drops.Well. Its certainly got character. I guess I should watch my step eh?He slowly navigates his way through the mansion. It was a bit of a fixerupper. This he was certain of. He could fix this fixerupper with a little bit of love.First order of business... we move on up. As humble as this place is... I think some running water would do some good. Plus a lady like you could use some finer things in life. He had some savings stashed away for a rainy day. Perhaps this would be a good investment. At least he wouldnt be alone with just Mip any longer. Perhaps there will be enough lucrative opportunities to make things improve. He follows Kosukes lead down into the cellar which looked far more stabilized. Despite her surroundings she made the place still presentable. It had an interesting atmosphere.Hmm. Candles? How romantic.He continued to look around the room and noticed a bag. And it was moving.UHHH. WHAT IS THAT? Is there something alive in there? I swear it better not be a bag of spiders.That was then when he realized he was with a fire mage. So she could technically burn it with fire if it were. That put him slightly more at ease.,Magnolia_Town,cr25by9,1,t5_37pcj
3912091,0,t1_cqrnor5,Michael just sighed shaking off the magic in his hands. He held out his right hand towards the small cat looking girl palm up shaking his head slightly. Look girl I have no interest in getting the authorities involved. Just give the man back his wallet and I can go buy you dinner. Youre clearly on your own or you wouldnt resort to stealing. So cmon just do the right thing.,Magnolia_Town,cr27pku,1,t5_37pcj
3955365,0,t1_cr72wpq,Grace lifted her head wearily and took a few seconds to fully wake up. She stood up and picked Lukas up from out of Michaels arms. She walked outside of the station and gently woke Lukas up by rubbing his shoulder and kissing him on the foreheadLook darling this is where were going to live were going to go to our knew home.Lukas looked around sleepily. He then pointed at Michael.Is he coming?Lukas asked his mother. Grace sighed.Im not sure sweetheart Michael is probably very tired and wants to go to his home and sleep in his own bed. We can see him another time if you want.Lukas nodded. Grace turned to face Michael. Im sorry you must be so warn out.She told Michael. ,Magnolia_Town,cr758sz,1,t5_37pcj
3979493,0,t1_cr8c4qn,This is high speed magic! The man roared with glee as he twisted in mid air flashing yellow before appearing behind Titus. And it seems youre finally starting to get it.He tapped Titus on the shoulder before sprinting away down the street. In all honesty Titus had next to no chance to actually get away from nor catch the man. In fact the man had no expectation of Titus actually getting the ribbon. All he wanted to see is if Titus could think as fast as his body could move as that was very important to this type of magic.,Magnolia_Town,cr9w8n3,1,t5_37pcj
3983984,0,t1_cr9jrsg,Kimi nods looking around and realizing that the waitress was right and there werent any tablesIll go sit at the bar I suppose.Kimi smiles when the woman compliments her hatThank you.She walks over to the bar and takes a seat an as she sits down she realizes that her bear is still in her hood and she wonders if she should send it back to the spirit world while she eats at the tavern,Magnolia_Town,craer3q,1,t5_37pcj
4080746,0,t1_crld6ev,What its like to really be a wizard? What a load of baloney. If he didnt believe what she said then so be it. Not much of any reason for her to care. She was sad that she didnt get a chance to kick him in the shin but she figured that if anything his invitation would be an opportunity to get some eventual payback.She didnt respond as he walked off but she found it strange that despite all his effort in chasing her he would give up like that but she got what she wanted so in the end she wasnt concerned.,Magnolia_Town,crlfile,1,t5_37pcj
4310139,0,t1_csbfab5,She started to clap again.Did you read the stories I told you about? Its fine if you didnt it just helps understand moreShe shrugs and stands up.So now that youve got control down why dont you try to put more energy into it?,Magnolia_Town,csbh91a,1,t5_37pcj
4433585,0,t1_csph96t,I live in the city what did you say about a dark guild? Maxwell asked in a quick fashion his right hand moving to the hilt of his sword. There were two reasons that someone sought a dark guild to destroy it or to lend their services. If this guy was trying to join he could be very dangerous.All of the guilds within Magnolia are official and Ive heard nothing of a dark guild operating in the area. Why are you asking about it?,Magnolia_Town,cspjhq4,1,t5_37pcj
4484385,0,t1_cst7ozp,The small creature nods its head in understanding.You must mean the titanstag beeties! They are over by the river! They are really friendly so they wont attack you as long as you treat them nicely! But some scary yelling person was there with some horses and people in armour...you should be careful! I can take you there if you want! Its not far!,Magnolia_Town,csvx6w2,1,t5_37pcj
4486106,0,t1_cst7voj,With a slam from the door downstairs Titus crashes into the building mounting the stairs he sprints them three at a time. Skidding to a halt in front of Vikkis apartment looking at the scene as well as Maxwell speaking with some random woman.I came as soon as I heard what has happened Max? Wheres Vikki? What happened?uFabricSever,Magnolia_Town,csw4xv0,1,t5_37pcj
4607125,0,t1_ctailk3,Um the guild hall is run down but I know they plan to fix it. There arent many members Im sure if they could get more members it would be a pretty good guild. She shrugs she didnt know anything besides what Michael told her.Michael doesnt talk about it too much Im sorry thats all I know.,Magnolia_Town,ctbb95z,1,t5_37pcj
4659608,0,t1_cthvmzr,He doesnt move but watches with interest as Kosuke lights up the night. It was a blaze of beauty and showed that she had some mastery of her craft though it could use some polishing. Some of the techniques he had meditated and trained with could have helped with her fire manipulation as well. When she was finished he gave a short amused clap.Quite enchanting. Youve earned my respect little girl. I can forsee that you will become a powerful mage in your own right and with enough time and practice. Perfection in art is always hard to achieve...He says this as he creates another blade seemingly out of thin air.Even harder to sustain.The blade quickly dissipates and he looks at her sidelong.But those with true passion are the only ones with a chance at achieving it.,Magnolia_Town,cthwfkj,1,t5_37pcj
4673150,0,t1_ctj8g48,Sounds to me like you still have a lot to discover. But like our magic... it just means there is more to use and countless potential.He looks over at Zohui and witnesses the powerful and unique display of magic. He himself could create any sort of tool but nothing that could move on its own. This mage was something else.With that drive and dedication I have no doubt you will catch up and perhaps surpass your own expectations.He gives an encouraging smile as a few ice crystals float by from the magic previously used.,Magnolia_Town,ctjlnzr,1,t5_37pcj
4771539,0,t1_ctvmy2b,Someone with nothing better to do that wants a little piece and quiet Maxwell replied from under his hat. This voice was familiar but it wasnt really pulling up an image of a face or a name. Continuing to maintain his slow steady breathing and not making any other move to acknowledge the other man.Was there something you wanted? the Ronin asked from below his hat enjoying the warm sun and the shade.,Magnolia_Town,ctvzu8c,1,t5_37pcj
4783191,0,t1_ctx4jz5,The girl continues to snicker at every dumb little joke as if they were all totally hilarious. From the relentless fits of giggles to the way she was beginning to sway on her stool over time it becomes increasingly obvious that this one has had a little bit too much to drink.Dark Caricature? Is that some kinda creepy cartoon magic?It might have sounded like a poor attempt at a joke but the way she said it made it sound as though she was legitimately curious. She quickly shakes her head and returns to the matter at hand the scrawled symbols on the slip of paper before them.No no... Its not nonsense! I wrote this myself... The paper should catch on fire but its not! I can make it explode but not catch fire! Watch!She grabs the pen beside the paper and begins rapidly scribbling minor additional arcane symbols here and there hastily attempting to create a demonstration. If Sophia doesnt interfere the paper will burst into flames and explode into the air harmlessly save for leaving a charred spot on the counter where it used to be.,Magnolia_Town,ctxgmcd,1,t5_37pcj
4831998,0,t1_cu2634u,Saint smiles and waves!Keep safe! And no problem! Just dont get in too deep trying to find anything! Saint goes back about his business...Good kid He thinks to himself. Hope he stops running with the shady crowds...that kind of lifestyle makes you end up dead in an alley somewhere with your throat slit...OoC Thanks for the RP! Fun as always!,Magnolia_Town,cu3m2vl,1,t5_37pcj
4844082,0,t1_cu54lxh,You wanna help us? Any names you want?Grace to the baby in a joking manner. The baby yanked her mothers finger making a small noise. Grace patted the bed next to her.She wants her daddyGrace said with a smile as kissed the top of the babys head.You dont look like a Summer what are we gonna name you? ,Magnolia_Town,cu54sta,1,t5_37pcj
4948865,0,t1_cuibs3i,Thats an awful lot of questions Miss...Jack shakes his head contemplating his odds here. She didnt know his whole name and probably wouldnt be able to find where he lived with his siblings. After all he was very meticulous in keeping his very existence off the record.Still something told Jack that this lady wouldnt let him walk away without answers so he simply spills out the truth to her. At least most of it was the truth.The other two are eight and ten. Theyre by themselves but the oldest Jacob knows how to take care of his little brother and sister. I cant stay home with them all day I have to work. Yknow to buy food and pay bills. Just cause were kids doesnt mean we live for free.He frowns visibly upset by the fact that this woman had the nerve to get mad at him for working during the day. It wasnt like hiring a babysitter would be any more effective than just having Jacob look after the others.I... I snuck out cause I was bored... Little Henry admits full of shame for causing so much trouble just for a little bit of fun. Jack doesnt want us to leave the house alone... He says something bad could happen to one of us.,Magnolia_Town,cuicf2k,1,t5_37pcj
4955440,0,t1_cuive98,Tasty? Huh What did Tousen mean by that wondered Sophia when she smelled a whiff of some street vendors food. And another mystery was solved by mere coincidence. After having waved Tousen and Zohui in the seamstress herself followed after closing the do her bare feets steps being louder on the wooden floor than her friends. Ill remind you to let me touch your biceps then. she sighed and rolled her eyes in fake irritation. Its kind of a trick only the living room and bathroom are really spacious which makes it look quite big. she responded already wandering off to what was presumably the kitchen and getting Tousen some of the promised water. While she was away in the kitchen Tousen would obviously look around in the room. Sophia didnt lie her living room was quite big and featured a lot of small oddities. For instance Tousens seating accommodation was right under one of three smaller windows which flooded the room with much needed sunlight. Right next to it there was a gap where  judging by the different shades of wooden floor  Sophias couch was standing originally. Now it just kind of sat there in the middle of the room facing a bookshelf filled with a variety of huge tomes bound in leather newer and older paperbacks. Not all of them were in the shelf though and some were lying on the ground the only book Tousen could make out without standing up was a big tome bound in pale leather that read Dark Ecriture and its basic uses.  On a weapon rack in the corner across from Tousen rested a duo of pole weapons one being an ornate doublebladed black scythe which slightly resembled a dragon wing and a smaller less imposing glaive with a broad single bladed head. Right next to them was a scarcely used fire place with a few pictures placed on top of it. Right in front of Tousen was a small table that could double as dining table in times of need but was probably merely intended for playing cards or placing drinks on them. Despite Sophias enthusiasm when it came to clothes there was only a neatly folded leather outfit hanging over the edge of the love seat where Tousen resided. Which was sort of odd considering there was a folding screen placed in the other corner of the room for the sake of dressing. Three doors were in the room one next to the roomdivider was closed one could be easily identified as the bathroom by the tub and tiled floor in it and through the third came Sophia with a cylindrical glass of water. Not enough to consider getting them murdered based on your choice of words. she simply retorted bending over to place Tousens glass and a saucer in front of him inadvertently showing the younger man a bunch of cleavage. Theyre a bunch of noisy dickwads sometimes but theyre good people. So unless they really do something to piss me off theyre safe. With a raised brow she chuckled to herself amused by two particular things she was about to say. Youd think I could off their heads myself without involving a poor mechanic. Sophia clearly alluded to her now secondary career and the weapon rack in her living room was a good example for it. Also. Do me a solid. Youre sitting on something I need so can you take a look and hand it to me please? she asked donning a pretty smile and holding out her right. Now if Tousen were to do such a thing hed find two objects of cloth namely Sophias bra and panties she had sorted out for the day. Both articles were white and adorned with lacy details and a tiny golden bow. She didnt tell him what it was Tousen would figure it out by himself.,Magnolia_Town,cuj69a8,1,t5_37pcj
