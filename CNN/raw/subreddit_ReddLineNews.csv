Kelly and Kim Jeongah.The show The Adventures of Mina amp Jack consists of only one short episode at the moment though another is in the works. The characters names have been changed but their images are unmistakable and the episode features a brief tribute to the viral moment that brought it into being. So far it can only be seen on YouTube and no major or minor outlet has signed up to distribute it.Marion became a favorite of viewers the world over when she strolled into the room where her father fated to be known forever after as the BBC Dad was conducting an interview about South Korean politics. She was closely trailed by her infant brother who was in a walker. Mr. Kelly chose to continue the interview at the end of the clip his wife dashes in sliding across the floor and almost falling in her effort to remove the kids from the room.Lauren Martin who used to write for Elite Daily and is now a producer who helps create content at Complex pronounced herself obsessed with the clip in an interview on Thursday saying that she thought she had watched the video like  times.I just love Marion Ms. Martin  said. I just love her.She and her boyfriend Jarryd Mandy who live in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn decided that the world needed more of the Kelly kids. Originally they had planned to write a childrens book but decided the project would be better as a cartoon. The couple contracted a studio Raxo to make a pilot episode. Here it is.The Williamsburg couple decided not to seek the familys blessing before they had a finished product and sent the first cartoon to Mr. Kelly with bated breath.But he declared himself a fan even retweeting the video from his Twitter account amid posts about French politics the South Korean election and the nuclear threat posed by North Korea.Mr. Kelly and his family are still using Skype as he was when the original interview mishap took place. They used the platform to talk to the Brooklyn couple on Wednesday night Ms. Martin said. Mr. Kelly is now officially a consultant for the cartoon and the family will have some creative control.If the show manages to make money Ms. Martin said the Kellys will also receive some of the royalties though she admitted we havent really gotten that far.Mina and Jack the names for the Marion and James characters in the cartoon have so far only had one adventure in North Africa where they accompanied their father and helped foil a gold thief. Marion is the star of the show James is her sidekick and her father is portrayed as a clumsy but lovable idiot.The pilot lasts just over three minutes. Ms. Martin said that she and Mr. Mandy have spent a significant amount of their savings on the second episode.NY Times articles have  tracking cookies and  tracking scripts.
