173230,0,t1_cey5pwj,Well it isnt bad but it doesnt hold my interestMy personal taste is stuff like cormac mccarthy but thats my personal taste I can put that aside to analyze writing in different genres and styles,WritersGroup,cey5wf3,2,t5_2rh95

695325,0,t1_cgedyu7,Me too i think its because the emphasis is on beat rather than off beat. We can change it by adding a syllable lets see if it works.

758183,0,t1_cgpuflg,Yes I wasnt sure whether to post on there or on here as this was specific to writing groups and that was specific to the genre but there was no specific subreddit to incorporate both. I took my chances PAre you a fantasy writer?,WritersGroup,cgqgnb2,1,t5_2rh95
775406,0,t1_cgscyp3,Thanks so much for the feedback! Mutant Cat Baby made me laugh way too hard. Your point about the characters being too perfect and there being no conflict is spoton. I did this because the conflict is coming in a big way and the characters very big flaws will be revealed because of it. Ill try to work in more foreshadowing of these things. Also unrealistic pregnancy because uncommon baby... maybe too unrealistic? Again thanks a lot your comments are super helpful.,WritersGroup,cgsf231,2,t5_2rh95

1445132,0,t1_cixedfn,I agree on everything this is exactly what I wanted! Ill change the inconsistencies immediately as well as shorten my description of the painting. And giving them some sort of anxiety is also a great way of portraying it adding that too. This was exactly what I wantedneeded. Also I didnt even know that atleast was two different words I have no idea how I could have missed that. So thanks for that too!Im writing in English because I want to get better at it but also because my mothertongue sounds dumb. But I think a lot of people can relate to THAT feeling. And no I have not read Attack on Titan! But seeing as its kind of popular I think I should. Thank you again! If you want to read the updated version then just tell me and Ill send it over when Im done.,WritersGroup,cixf9f6,-2,t5_2rh95
1505455,0,t3_2b3ddy,gtWhat started as a few police cruisers directing traffic away from square soon evolved into a contingent of officers mounted on horseback.I wouldnt use evolved here. Its too fancy for the purpose. ...soon grew into a contingent... is fine. Go for directness rather than flourish.I would also start in with the SWAT team. Sets up the scene much better you get a better idea of what is going on start to wonder what is at stake. A town that is hot isnt the most exciting thing in the world.You could sprinkle how hot it is throughout the scene. Sweat on the policemans brow. Uniforms adding to the discomfort of a sweltering night. A cop that comments on the heat. Etc. Try to avoid dumping description on us very few writers can pull that type of thing off and most of them have the last name Joyce of Zola. And besides this is an exciting scene so these kind of descriptions only slow you down. ,WritersGroup,cj4ze1k,1,t5_2rh95
1844663,0,t3_2fifni,Take everything with a grain of salt.  Its your writing so you have to decide what advice you accept disregard et cetera.gt It was the sole relic from their first home together but now it along with the house was his alone.Are we in the abovementioned house?I enjoyed the melancholy your story gave me.  However I was a little confused toward the middle.  I was wondering too many questions.  Who Clare was is someone dead?  At the end I got it.If Id written it Id have brought attention to the piano earlier.  Maybe the FedEx box is on the lid.  Maybe he uses the business cards as a coaster setting down his scotch and opens the keytop.  He might try to play a little something but only hits a couple notes when he hears a bed creak upstairs? He remembers Clare and he goes upstairs and the rest follows as you wrote it.Thats how Id have done it.  Do what you will with that knowledge.I did enjoy the implication the business cards had of him sacrificing his marriage? for his career.  Especially with the stationary looking duller than he had imagined.  I read this as a very nice parallel for how he subconsciously feels about his life.Well done.CheersArtisticvanity,WritersGroup,ckbh7ka,3,t5_2rh95
2949436,0,t3_2s9guj,The steady strop of sneakers on asphalt echoed through the predawn air. The shrill chorus of birdsong that should have accompanied the noise was absent stifled under the blanket of death that draped the world. Milling about a Maple gone to seed  sullen and silent  Claire wondered at the birds. Had they any understanding of what had befallen their kin? Did they know they were among the last of their kind? Did they care? It seemed to Claire that some species should even if it was just the birds. She stubbed her cigarette out in spatter of fresh droppings and mused. Not even the apocalypse could slow lifes endless production of shit.,WritersGroup,co3d56p,1,t5_2rh95

4742732,0,t3_3ftcz3,My topofthehead suggestion would be to focus this piece. There are some good humorous turns and ideas but its difficult to discern the purpose of the piece or a unifying theme. If the title for example were simple and clear then it would lay the foundation for the rest of the piece and orient the reader.,WritersGroup,ctsd6tw,2,t5_2rh95
5420124,0,t1_cw4djd4,Thanks for the feedback! I was trying convey a kind of discrepancy in the relationship bw Bill and his wife...probably going to make it into a longer piece try and make what I was going for a bit clearer and add on to what I already have. Just wanted some feedback on style of writing etc.,WritersGroup,cw4h84c,2,t5_2rh95

10441954,0,t3_5pf6up,As a standalone poem i dont think this quite works for me. The language lacks a vibrancy a demand for attention that i prefer in poems. I can however see this as being a very effective song lyric.,WritersGroup,dcrob2h,1,t5_2rh95
