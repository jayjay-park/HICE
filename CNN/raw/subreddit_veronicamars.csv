552159,0,t3_20g4fa,Logans entire storyline was unconvincing to me. If he really was reformed and a military officerpilot what was he doing dating a druggie pop star who he went to high school with? And he had a great year dating her and theres no mention of him being deployed during part of that time although he leaves the moment the movie drama is ending? That entire premise seemed completely contrived.,veronicamars,cg31cl8,14,t5_2tn8f
554532,0,t1_cg36e7g,I feel like the spanning continents line near the end might have had  meanings. Obviously Logans job but also the big outcry from fans to extend the kickstarter campaign to Europe and Australia as well which the eventually did.,veronicamars,cg3b27v,3,t5_2tn8f
558807,0,t1_cg3s6we,I like to think its just a few obnoxious ones that stick out. I dont want them in my fandom anyway! Its like anything else.

578805,0,t3_20r45o,While we would all love for more people to support the movie in theaters or on VOD I have to agree with everyone else and say that you would definitely enjoy the movie a whole lot more if you see the show first. The movie was made for the fans so most of the jokes and cameos are more appreciated by fans. It is an amazing series and you wont be sorry you watched it! ,veronicamars,cg62bx2,2,t5_2tn8f
602421,0,t1_cg8f95z,Not really.  Veronica Mars started off on the UPN...which not many people had.  After season two UPN combined with the WB to create the CW.  I know I started watching in season  when I actually had VM.  My guess would be that more and more people flocked to the show once it was widely available and rated those episodes higher.  That being said I think both seasons one and two as a whole are much better than season three.  And the series finale is far from what I consider to be the best episode of the series.,veronicamars,cg8qymi,5,t5_2tn8f
651150,1,t3_21fa88,Im only about  chapters in and while Im enjoying it Im hating the writing. I cant be the only one hoping they fire whoever edited this book can I?

2524306,0,t1_cmnzro8,I Have WeeVer tattood on my right wrist  it symbolizes so much more than a non cannon ship on a TV show. Through my love of the show I have had the opportunity to meet much of the cast and even become friends with them I also started going to conventions because of a UK company bringing over the cast and that introduced me to my family and a group of girls that keep me sane on a regular basis one of which also has LoVe tattood on her wrist and I also run a WeeVer fanfic site. The show has meant so much to me from cloudwatchers and donating dvds to libraries and sending mars bars to the network and then the movie after so long proving that the fans never stopped caring  It has become so very important to how I view myself as a person. And yes six small letters contain an awful lot to me. ,veronicamars,cmo2b92,0,t5_2tn8f
3306271,0,t1_co34bnt,Just finished the book...I agree with most of what you said. I like Leo and really enjoyed their friendship until the last part of the book. I feel like everyone just forgets that Logan is a nice guy!! He has always been incredibly patient and sweet with Veronica despite all her accusations against him. Yes he has his faults and a questionable past but shes always kept him at a distance even to the point where in this book she didnt want to say she was scared to lose him. I though we were past that! I know hes away and its gonna be hard but its been a week and shes already thinking about another guy. Not fair to Logan or Leo.I thought bringing the mother in the first book was a bit of a stretch  but the Grace Manning story worked really well knowing her history made us understand the character a lot more and it made me really sad to find out what had become of her. The Sinclair thing was also unnecessary but I guess it gave Mac a reason to obsess over the case and more importantly the surveillance footage. I also thought it was pretty obvious from as soon as Veronica spoke to the bar tender that Grace was an escort. But I did not expect the Weevil plot twist. When Rob Thomas finally says goodbye to Neptune I hope Weevil gets justice. I know he doesnt quite deserve it right now but Ive wanted this since he got arrested at graduation in season .,veronicamars,cp5538u,3,t5_2tn8f

9494926,0,t3_5att79,When I first watched it it was easily the best pilot Id ever seen. Granted that was nine years ago but it still ranks VERY highly for me. How did you like it? Would it make your top five pilots? Can you tell Duncan from Logan? Most cant at this point! Have you seen Buffy? The character dynamics in both shows are very similar I wont explain too deeply since I dont want to spoil you but I think every Buffy character has a counterpart in VM save maybe one. I think being aware of the similarities might cheapen VM slightly for you. Anyway enjoy! Easily one of my favorite shows. ,veronicamars,d9jgavi,3,t5_2tn8f
9503655,0,t1_d9k7m4p,True. They play reruns on a SJW type cable channel and use it as a way to demonstrate inequality and privilege. I also remember the haves vs havenots being a big theme throughout.,veronicamars,d9kj0q1,1,t5_2tn8f
