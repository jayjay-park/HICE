681760,0,t1_cghq3i7,The RFC spec requires only one SPF record More than one record is off spec but it looks like BIND has started including an actual SPF type DNS record rather than just having it as a TXT record so you need to have both for situations where there are servers that only look for actual SPF records or a TXT record. If you have one but not the other you might end up in a situation where the SPF entry is either ignored or rejected. Most public DNS providers Godaddy netsol etc. only allow for TXT records in their DNS zones at the moment.

1961185,0,t3_2gv2t5,Very helpful stuff.After reading and absorbing it looks like you could utilize a DAC in a stretched AD environment that extends to the DR site. So you could have the same example as in the Original Post and if there was an outage and of course you have CAS servers on the DR side you would manually bring the databases on the DR side online.After repointing the MX records manually then after replication you could have a small contigent of users utilize the DR side while the primary is being rebuilt or eventually put online.Then when the primary comes online it will check the bit for DAC and the DR site will report the bit as  and the others at the primary will be able to mount after truing up the information in the Databases in the DAG?My understanding is also with it being an uneven number of servers an FSW wouldnt be required as there is a place that has more servers and can achieve quorum from having a majority.So say we have Exchange   sets of CAS servers one set at the primary and another at DR DAC setup and all servers members of the same DAG with the setup of the Mailbox Servers like they are in the first post it should be able to have HA at the Primary and Data replicated to the DR site with the ability to activate in an absolute emergency?,exchangeserver,ckpiw9w,0,t5_2woeg

2375688,0,t1_cm5bm8x,I think its just a stylistic writing choice. It gets some peoples attention while it may put others off. I think the main point being presented is that we cant ignore the cloud with Exchange on the whole. I have no doubt many customers will be running Exchange in the same way they always have for another  years. Trying to predict anything in IT further out than that is very difficult.But if youre not in one of these shops that have no intent of ever moving to the cloud amp youre either a consultant or looking for work youll need to add a new skillset to hope for continued employment. Knowing identity amp hybrid will be important skills for an Exchange expert who wants continued employment over the span of the next decade.But this isnt anything new. Ive worked with Notes GroupWise Exchange . admins who werent interested in learning new technology. I knew one older guy who had zero interest in learning autodiscover when  came out. The same guy had no interest in learning Hybrid when  came out with it. That guy essentially went into forced retirement because the industry left him behind. I think there will be a place for onprem exchange admins for the next  years but only if theyre willing to adapt amp learn. I think that was the general message of the article.,exchangeserver,cm5cdoo,4,t5_2woeg
2379892,0,t1_cm5cdoo, years ago we a large fortune  would never have considered the cloud for email for security reasons we have given it a few serious looks not just O but others as well.  Fast forward to today and we now have an O tenant as well as utilizing AWS that talks to our internal Active Directory things that were show stoppers back then.  Now were not using O for mail yet but more for the Office suite and OneDrive but none of this was even approachable back then.  A large part of our move is the deals MSFT has been offering that has made it crazy to not start moving to the cloud.Ive been working with Exchange as my sole role since Exchange . early just after . in both small lt to large gt and all I could do was shake my head a few years ago when I went to a conference and MSFT was pushing offpremise really hard.  It was hard to believe they were pushing something that larger customers didnt want or need.To be honest I agree with the Tony at this point to a degree.  I dont do Exchange like I used to I spend easily  of my time with PowerShell these days but youre right about needing to be willing to adapt and learn.  The landscape is starting to change to where certain things are slowly shifting to the cloud whether the business wants it or they are lured by crafty license savings and Exchange and Lync are in that boat.  I literally sat in meetings where I repeatedly saw our director of IT security say fck no the moment someone brought up cloud stuff and today his tone has changed to a degree.Besides its always good to have something to fall back on and to be learning new things.  In our industry you cannot let yourself fall into the trap of getting stagnant...you will niche yourself into something that will eventually disappear or that will be really hard to find a job if you should need it.,exchangeserver,cm5v2se,3,t5_2woeg

If the organization your friend works for has policies against this its not worth losing his or her job over.  I would suggest the user contact his or her manager if there is a business case for having access on a mobile device.  Depending on the nature of the data pushing it to a rd party could make things even worse.As for the technical side its typically something like autodiscover.domain or mail.domain.  Note that even though ActiveSync is enabled for accounts by default in Exchange  it is likely restricted or disabled if a company has policies against using personal devices.  Syncable data email contacts calendars tasks notes etc all comes over the ActiveSync connection.,exchangeserver,cnbyhl4,3,t5_2woeg

The usual method is to move the current SSL certificate to the new server along with the host names within DNS etc. Then use another host name legacy.example.com is the usual format for the old server. That is handled either by a cheap single name SSL certificate or by adding the name to the existing certificate. That is done before any mailboxes are moved. All clients then initially hit the new server and Exchange will sort out whether they are proxy or redirected to the old server. As the mailboxes are moved the traffic continues to flow to the new server making the removal of the old server very straight forward. ,exchangeserver,cu4powp,2,t5_2woeg

Lastly Are you keeping your onprem domain around? I always recommend using ADFS or DirSync so that users dont need to remember a new set of credentials. ,exchangeserver,dbzzfas,3,t5_2woeg

10269592,0,t1_dc7t3pw,Id bet it is the storing mail in un altered form. With just archiving and no legal holds a user could theoritcally alter the message before it reaches the archive or hell even alter the message in the archiveOther than that naive archive would work I think. ,exchangeserver,dc844r7,1,t5_2woeg
10325024,0,t1_dcedftd,My understanding is youd only be able to create mailboxes in the domain that Exchange is in.  Theres a few options on how to handle this in the kind of migration youre doing.. When you migrate a user you transfer their SID history as well.  This gives them access to resources in the old domain until appsservers are moved as well.  As I mentioned there can be some small problems.. Stand up a new Exchange server in your new domain and do usermailbox as the migration step.  The viability of this option may depend on your current Exchanges versions and the quality of its setup in my case there was an initial push for a new Exchange because  acts as a constraint on the use of newer Outlook versions. Move towards a resource forest model.  In this model you have your user objects in  forest and Exchange in another with linkage between the user and mailbox.  It is a supported model according to Microsoft but it does increase complexity and can cause possibly cause problems.,exchangeserver,dceed1q,1,t5_2woeg

11052891,0,t3_5wk0kk,I had this exact same issue. Most likely the host that the mailbox is sitting on is too busy. The managed folder assistant is a low priority process that gets throttled if there is any resource contention. If the host is very busy this can mean that it constantly gets throttled and hardly does anything. You can verify that it is getting throttled by using this script and looking at the user  MRM Component Diagnostic Logs.txt file. Search for something similar to Microsoft.Exchange.WorkloadManagement.ResourceUnhealthyException. This means that MFA was throttled due to lack of resources. But you can pretty much assume this is the case based on the lack of data moving.SolutionMove the user mailbox to a different database. Simply run NewMoveRequest user. You can monitor the move with GetMoveRequest user and GetMoveRequestStatistics user.You can check to see if the target server is different from the source server it probably is. Once the move has completed run StartManagedFolderAssistant again.You can check the progress with GetMailboxStatistics user Archive | select itemcounttotalitemsizeYou should see much faster progress after the mailbox move.

11188736,0,t3_5zqqj8,Thats not going to work. DKIM adds s signature based on the message headers. As soon as the message travels through Symantec.Cloud the headers are modified which invalidates the DKIM signature.gt Ive called MSFT and DKIM isnt supported with any onprem version of ExchangeI think this statement is not correct. DKIM is not a feature of any version of Exchange but that has nothing to do with supportability. Youre absolutely right there are rd party products that can add the DKIM signature on Exchange.Im not exactly sure what Symantec product or service youre using but if your message hygiene solution does not offer a DKIM feature then its time to consider switching vendors. ,exchangeserver,df08ah0,2,t5_2woeg
