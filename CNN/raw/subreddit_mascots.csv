1895914,0,t3_2gc6so,I like his look and from the little Ive seen of him in action he seems like a good character.  I think overall his look would fit in more with MLB mascots but he should do well in the NHL too.,mascots,ckhnc8a,1,t5_2wg7k

2970818,0,t3_2u4ejt,So how is business?  Its been interesting watching you build up your company over the last couple years stalker much? over social media.  Ive always wondered how hard it would be to get a mascot manufacturing company going especially since there seem to be so many established.,mascots,co5sp7i,1,t5_2wg7k
3804380,0,t3_33zdba,Welcome!  Will this be a onetime or will you be doing it as the regular for games?  The advice Ill be giving here will be in general but if you are doing multiple games Ive got additional tips.  After reading what Ive written below it seems like a daunting list.  It turned out a lot longer than I intended.  Number  is most important the rest are just bonuses that could make you better.. Always have fun.  If you are having a great time then most likely the people watching you will be too.  If you are hating it I guarantee the people watching will know.. Remember what you are doing this for.  If you are trying to sell something then be eye catching and dont let them look away.  If you are doing ingame entertainment then be entertaining but not at the expense of the game.  If you are trying to educate or raise awareness be respectful above all and express your message clearly.  Set your level to what you are meant to do.. Dont ever stand still.  People are always watching you.  Even if you have to stand there and listen to a presentation or something subtle swaying or head motions will keep your character alive.  Its an animation principle called keepalive or moving holds.. If you have access to the costume before the event try it on in front a full length mirror or camera if you cant find a mirror.  Try different walks or poses to see how they work.  Try to tell a story through pantomime.  Try to tell someone you lost your keys and you need them to drive you to the airport.  Try something stupid.  Pretend you are a dinosaur.. Does the character already have a defined personality?  If so what can you do to convey that?  If not then come up with one.  Always do everything in character.  You arent a person in costume you are a character.. How are your dance moves?  Depending on your market you might want to learn what the kids are doing now days but there are always classics that everyone expects you to know try to pick up as many as you can.  Ive been trying to do that for years and I still feel inadequate so dont sweat it. Pace yourself.  If this is your first time then you wont know what your limits are.  How long is the event?  How long are your sets?  When will your breaks be?  How will you know you cant wear a watch or look at your phone?  Where will your breaks be?  Can you get there by yourself and get out of costume by yourself in an emergency?. You mentioned you have about a month.  When done right this is a very physical activity that will exhaust you.  Make sure that you can do cardio for a good amount of time.  If you need to get in shape between now and then.  Running is a good method and is easy.  I know a guy that soaks a towel then wraps it around his head and tries to breathe through it while running on a treadmill.  You dont have to go that far hes crazy but remember that your airflow will be restricted in suit.. Hydrate.  Hydrate.  Hydrate.  Start the day before and keep it up.  Not trying to be crude but you should be peeing clear before your event.  Yes that means going to the bathroom about every hour.  Once in suit you will sweat it out rather than pee it out.  Lots of people talk about loosing  pounds or so in a night from doing this that just means they arent drinking enough.  You shouldnt loose any weight.  Anything you sweat out should be replaced.. Dont eat any foods that give you problems the day before.  You dont want any gastrointestinal issues to distract you.TLDR Have fun and everyone else will too!,mascots,cqpxhjh,5,t5_2wg7k
5370515,0,t1_cvy4tsc,gt Oh OK. So if I say that Im willing to do the suit bit then Im likely to get it?Thats often been my experience yes.gt I understand what youre saying but Im not interested in going pro... Just really want to try it once or twice!Yup that makes sense. But once youve done it you might get hooked. Or you might decide you really really really dont want to do it ever again. Or something in between.,mascots,cvy56ki,1,t5_2wg7k
7947419,0,t3_4o1421,Wow...just how many of those mascot suits does Houston have? Thats like  worth of costumes in that picture,mascots,d49d4z5,2,t5_2wg7k
