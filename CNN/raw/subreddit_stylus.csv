3224350,0,t1_cow5nvl,Im really pleased to hear that!  is a great price especially given that its more difficult to find units these days. I think Acer made a mistake with the new R. Not only did they switch away from NTrig to the inferior Synaptics pen the hinge mechanism is a major step backwards. The R hinge is far better and more stable for drawing in my opinion.I just finished a drawing session on my R just now and I thought I should mention that Ive replaced the battery in the pen the other day for the first time since I bought the R back in August. Considering I use it so much Im not going to complain about the battery and I have a spare sitting in my drawer. The performance with the SSD must be quite nice! Im not really brave enough to open mine up to do it and Im satisfied with the nice big GB drive thats currently in it. I hope youll enjoy drawing with the R as much as I do. It did take me a few weeks to adjust to the pressure curve but Im completely comfortable with it now. Manga Studio is fantastic with its pressure curve options although I mostly use Paint Tool SAI and Photoshop. SAI is also fantastic on the R. ,stylus,cow7hbb,2,t5_2yf96
