482100,0,t3_1zlkfz,Youre well within weight standards and youll only lose weight at boot camp so that part is fine.  pullups will set you apart from everyone else but thats about as far as physical strength will get you. Work on the running and general cardio. Almost everything in boot camp is body weight so the weight training will only help you to a certain point and then its just endurance.And enjoy your muscle while you have it  youre gonna lose a bunch after  weeks of limited highcarb nutrition no periworkout nutrition and almost no resistance training.,USMCboot,cfv2gfb,8,t5_2xmbn

1471190,0,t3_2azqqg,I see a lot of people in here accusing the recruiter of lying. And as a recently former recruiter i have to say this is not the case. In all honesty its just bad timing on your part. There are most likely active duty spots available but their ship dates are going to be for the primetime for HS Seniors JulyOct. Somewhere up the chain someone decided to hold those spots for seniors which pushes you into a different time frame and therefore a different pool of jobs. Since it is so late in the fiscal yr its very likely that the only jobs they have available at this point are Reserve jobs. Now you can still do the two yrs and then go active but as a former I and I Marine as well ill tell you that of the ten or so reserve Marines ive seen try only one was accepted.Take a look at the reserves and since you are a grad you can go talk to other recruiters as well... but im willing to bet money he tells you the same thing.

2303404,0,t1_clwdti1,Oh gosh. It depends on your platform meaning your type of aircraft. If you are not on the flight schedule that day then you will be a mechanic and work on the aircraft. You will also most likely do aircraft inspections called DampTs. You will maintain your maintenance qualifications by either studying getting signoffs and taking tests. If you are more senior like a CPL then you may have a shop program and will have to make sure it is up to date and everything is taking care of. like you may be in charge of making sure everyone in the shop is up to date on their hazmat qualificationstraining or many other things. Also you will be testing helicopters meaning track and balancing the helicopter blades to make them more smooth. If you are going to be CH or a UHY crewchief you will be pro at this.Some things that could be platform specific is that is you are a Huey Crewchief you will concentrate on guns more. You could be coached more often about the various crew served weapons check a gun out form ordnance and break it down and reassemble and learn more about it.If you are on the flight schedule then that is your main priority. You will know the time of your brief take off and landing and what the general type of mission will be and who you are flying with. You will know the day before also.You will go and inspect your aircraft yourself unofficially to make sure its set up the way you want it for your mission and so you can get anything taking car of. You will then report to the briefing room with your pilots and go over all the technical data on how the weather is and what is going on in the air that day. You will then have brief with your crew and the main pilot will talk about the ins and outs on whats going to happen. It is always most likely a training mission and someone on the flights will be qualifying for a certain type of flight either you another crewchief or the copilot. After you land you will inspect the aircraft if you are a Plane Captain which you should be and that can take however long depending on your type of aircraft or if there is anything wrong or not.,USMCboot,clwf197,1,t5_2xmbn

Youre a boot and youll get bitched at if you dont have a good shave at all times. Just wear the boots you were issued. Once you get to the fleet or even your Aschool youll have an opportunity for better boots. I never had a problem with the boots I was issued. Only boots I liked more were the RAT boots you get before going into country. The humps really arent that bad but I personally never had a problem with them. Thick legs and a strong base made me great at hiking and shitty at running. If you made it through the crucible youll be fine here. Youll see an absurd amount of females fall out of them though. Hotel is a good idea but make sure you are at your point and place of duty in the appropriate uniform Service A the next morning. Enjoy your last night before training. This is basically th phase of boot camp. You wont get straight up hazed but the combat instructors can and will fuck with you.  Youre a PrivatePFC now. Recognize that you are literally at the bottom of the totem pole and will have to do a lot of shit duty. Dont get salty about it. We literally all had to do it. Dont try to mack on female boots. No seriously dont. You should have gotten plenty of poon on boot leave zero reason to jeopardize your career for some boot nugget female Marine. Same goes for the other way around.  Learn everything you can about weapon systems because this is likely the only place youll ever get to shoot anything other than an M. Dont fall asleep in class.

7067369,0,t3_4ce7xu,JFW  erroneous enlistment or medical condition disqualifying for military. Ouch.Youll have to talk to a recruiter however Im going to suggest that you look into the Coast Guard. If you injured yourself so badly in Air Force basic that you were forced out you have a statistically improbable chance of successfully completing Marine Corps Recruit Training. For example when I went through we started with over  and graduated with ish  most of the drops were medical. We lost somewhere between  during the first day of second phase in Camp Pendleton. We got thrashed in uneven ground and a few people blew out their knees and a few had ankle problems. Then people started dropping due to issues with carrying around the rucksack and humping hiking up and down the mountains. If you have knee problems that arent completely healed better than ever more or less you will struggle with second phase. Realistically if youre not  youll probably be a med drop in second phase. Pragmatically youll have to get a doctor or two to say youre OK and that your body knee is fit for military service. This will be difficult. You will need waivers. And you will also need to be prepared to pass the MEPS physical. Id be more concerned about Boot Camp than MEPS though. This is however assuming a recruiter will invest any time in you. I wouldnt. I would seriously consider the Coast Guard due to the physical requirements of Marine Corps Recruit Training. Im not saying its a certainty youll be a med drop but its more than likely. If I was the recruiter you talked to I wouldnt even entertain your request too much bullshit for a probable med drop. In Marine terms if you cant hack Air Force basic you have no business attempting Marine Corps Recruit Training.,USMCboot,d1hg5ys,4,t5_2xmbn

8380492,0,t1_d5p3ilt,Well the overall score is the QT and to be considered a good candidate youll need a .  But other important scores are the MM mechanical and EL electronics.No one really is required to join without a job guarantee except for the really low quality candidate who was accepted and granted a waiver which might have the stipulation that he is to join open contract.  The Marine Corps decided that rather than sell jobs as the other services do they focus on people who want to be Marines first and the job second.  Thats why the recruiters will talk to about jobs only after you qualify to be a Marine.  Its also better because if you only wanted to be a graphic artist but didnt qualify because you can only draw stick figures then you wouldnt be disappointed and leave.Anyway to get the job you want the job must be available and you must qualify for it.  Since jobs are based upon when you graduate boot camp and the formal school for it your ship date is another factor for qualification.  And since the recruiters have their own mission to ship people at specific times theyll only have certain jobs whenever you ship.My advice to you is that if you do want to do a job and you are qualified then wait for it to become available.  The higher quality candidate you are the more you can call the shots.  ,USMCboot,d5p3z0z,2,t5_2xmbn

Also if the OSO gives you the marine gouge guide with the F on the front ... Be aware that this material is basically  years out of date. The reading comp section was very different to the sort of reading comp I had expected like you see on the SAT and the math section was also very different vast majority of questions being about exponents and radicals rather than a ship is moving west at X knots and another moving E at Y knots when will they meet kind of questions. The only thing I can really recommend for the math section is to have algebra  locked down in your head. There are one or two questions that will require you to also show some creative thinking or perform multiple steps to get to the answer required so be careful that you are actuslly providing the answer that is asked for rather than the first thing that pops into mind. Joystick section ... Only advice for this is to play video games or play flight sim. I did the latter and it might have helped. I think this is frankly really something you cant prepare much for as Ive seen candidates consistently do poorly despite extra study effort. I wish you luck here.

Youve done all the right steps and I didnt read too closely but your police involvement IST scores college and volunteer hours are taken into account as well. Think of it as only the top  get these type of waivers. Most recruiters and SNCOICs will push the waiver as hard as they can but you have to give them a fighting chance by giving them all of the good stuff youve done and answering the questions they have.

Theres no need to come up with complex run plans unless youre training for halfmarathons or marathons.Set realistic simple goals and just run. Wind sprints interval blah blah blah is just going to stress you out more than necessary. Besides boot camp is physically easy. Youll see PT as a nice break from the quarter deck and getting fucked with. Its probably the most relaxing thing youll do while youre there. Just get out there and run. Personally I never timed my runs or even cared about it before boot camp. And I had consistent  min PFT times my entire  years in. I was hitting high s my last year in but I also cracked a vertebrae lol And as you can see my level of care also went down the longer I was in. I would run to the point where I wasnt winded or uncomfortable at the end. I would also suggest running on nonroad surfaces a track or other courses designed to absorb shock. Running on a road which youll find out really hurts your knees. Dont stress the joints before you start your Marine Corps fun. Also  crunches is pretty weak.
