Otherwise the ending of About Today could be what youre referring to.Have a rip?edit They played Lean and they dedicated to to Hoffman... thats a special setlist bruh.,TheNational,cf6qab5,3,t5_2sd2r
278825,0,t1_cf9jwiw,Did you say that Matt has little range? Listen to Available and Murder Me Rachael and then go listen to Fireproof and Pink Rabbits and get back to me on that. He may not hit higher notes like other artists but hes got a range like crazy.,TheNational,cf9nvaw,2,t5_2sd2r

1843811,0,t1_ckb896h,Yes and they opened by joking that they were about to play their angriest song .  I think its relatively common in their set lists actually. In the three times Ive seen them high violet tour double headlining with Arcade Fire and last night theyve played Available and segued into the middle of Cardinal Song. Really really fun and gorgeous especially when theyre touring with strings that can tackle the violin solo in Cardinal. The piano version last night was pretty great too though . ,TheNational,ckbdixm,4,t5_2sd2r

3593777,0,t1_cq1rz82,How did we get into the national? I mean once we got into them and got used to Matts voice we had a whole new world opened to us amp you fall in love with it because of his ability of being able to sing about these issues of fucking up not fitting in needing love not knowing what to do keeping a stoic face as youre a man etc. He does it in a reserved sort of metaphorically realistic manner  these are things you keep to yourself and you dont really wail out with a noticeable chorus. The music accompanies that well. Tbh the depressing thing is a big huge part of why I like them and why many love them right? But that comes laterSo I guess the barrier is getting used to matts voice I actually think listening to Alligator works really well. It doesnt jump straight into the bleakness. Its quite nice interpoly warm rock music with just huh interesting voice. Then when Mr November comes on theyll love it!Then winter time or if theyre feeling sad theyll move onto the other albums and find absolute solace in how it speaks to you and brings the national into its own from other bands where its at its best amp most powerful.Just my take on it anyway.editI meant to add it can come first and you may fall in love with them first if youre in a dark place and you listen to their bleaker songs first.edit just want to add if you guys like the the national check out a recent guy called benjamin clementine also influenced a lot by leonard cohen similar quite emotional stuff he bullied at school didnt get on with his family left home at  was homeless busked and lived in a hostel for  years. Again pretty emotional stuff though so best not watch it on a nice sunny afternoon haha.,TheNational,cq1x1k2,4,t5_2sd2r
4153119,0,t3_385b72,Ok so I searched through YouTube and I found  more acoustic setsI updated that playlist with those  new songs I found.I also found a lot of Notsoacoustic sets where there are electric guitars but acoustic guitars and piano too...So dont know if that really goes in the acoustic category. If you have any more suggestions I should add comment here,TheNational,crto3o4,1,t5_2sd2r
