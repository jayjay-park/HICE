6136455,0,t3_3x1vwd,LabPei mix he hates wet grass and is completely resistant to going outside when it has rained.  However he is pretty tolerant of baths.  He takes a little coaxing but seems to enjoy the water once he gets in.  Nevertheless he hates swimming. Im starting to think it may be a temperature thing.,sharpei,cyn5f7y,1,t5_2sqtp

11669591,0,t3_66h3td,Weve had four . . . and obviously we are devoted to the breed.  All four were rescues.  The first three being older dogs that we did not want to see sit out their remaining days in a shelter.  Ill try to give you an idea of each.  Phoebe was our first.  She was a PeiLab mix and probably the sweetest dog I have every known. Extremely kicked back and mellow.  Loved people and other dogs.  She developed Mast Cell cancer around the age of  and we had to let her go rather than let her suffer.  Next  Drake. Mr Amazing.  Did I say Ms P was mellow? Drake put her to shame.  He did not need to be leashed and wouldnt stray more than three feet from you. Mostly he was happiest sleeping but loved going to the dog park best as he was able to meet and greet both humans and other dogs.  He did suffer from separation anxiety tho and we stopped going out to eat or to a theater.  I attribute this to two things  Pei are totally devoted to their humans and as a rescue I think Drake was traumatized by the abandonment.  Drake developed kidney disease around the age of  so as a bucket list item we adopted Yoshi to give him a buddy since he enjoyed the company of other dogs so much.  Drake actually hung on a year longer than the vet said he would. More than likely he just didnt want to leave the pack any sooner than he needed to.  Yoshi was a huge goof ball.  We actually called him Buford behind his back as we were sure he had a still somewhere and would get into some moonshine now and then. Again an older dog with some fairly severe arthritis issues.  He was very reactive to other dogs when on a lead.  But take him to the dog park and he was a completely different dog once free from his restraints.  His old bones prevented him from running very quickly but he would sometimes surprise us with his ability to find a burst of energy from some hidden reserve.  Yoshi also developed kidney disease which took him faster than Drake. Since we had dealt with the issue before we pretty much knew what to expect so we simply made EVERY day that he decided to stick around the BEST day of his shortened life.  Currently we have Sadie  the youngest rescue that weve saved.  Shes about six and prefers humans to dogs.  Sort of the exact opposite to Yoshi in that regard.  When she sees another dog she basically just ignores it.  But she has to meet and greet just about every human who crosses her path.  She is a little bit of a slut in this regard.  Once you start petting her you will find you have started something she doesnt want you to stop.  Of the four she is probably the most guard dog of the four. Barks at door knocks or door bells.  Whines a little at the phone ring.  Perfect for me as I am somewhat hard of hearing and has become my service dog in this regard.  That said once I ask her to step back she allows me to take over the situation and waits patiently for me to open the door.  Extremely well behaved  she will not jump up on furniture or bed unless invited up.  A little bit of separation anxiety but mellows out quickly and lays down simply waiting for your return no destruction of property.  Over all the are a great breed . . . BUT you do need a good vet in your back pocket.  Because of inbreeding they do tend to have skin and ear issues.  Mostly can be maintained through diet. No grains  we find fish supplements such as sardines to help and we have the Costco coconut oil  pack.  In terms of energy level  they are the perfect dog for an apartment dweller.  They seem to be the exact opposite of a Jack Russel. Spending most of their time lazying about.  Sadie pretty much lets us know when she is bored and wants some play time.  As someone else stated they are devoted to the nth degree.  Bonding strongly.  They tend to be hand shy  especially around strangers  I attribute this to the folds in the skin around the eyes  they can not see a hand coming at them so they can turn away from a hand coming at them from above or the side.  Chest scratches seemed to be the way to go when meeting outsiders.  Hopefully that helps   Oh  lastly.  Shar Pei Fever.  Google it  get to know it.  All three pure breds suffered a bout or two.  It contributes to renal failure and is more than likely what brought that condition about in both Drake and Yoshi.  It is perhaps the one red flag that you want to be aware of if you are considering the breed.  Meat Mouths have more of a tendancy towards it than Bone Mouths.  Again it is more than likely due to the small gene pool in the US Google Law and SharPei for that story,sharpei,dgiridm,3,t5_2sqtp
11670448,0,t1_dgiry1z,Whoa that  for surgery is way too expensive. I had it done by my vet a top notch vet out here in the Hamptons Long Island  and only paid  for the surgery. ,sharpei,dgiv0c9,2,t5_2sqtp
