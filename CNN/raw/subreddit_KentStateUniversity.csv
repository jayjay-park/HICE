2846898,0,t3_2sphil,Hi I would really recommend living in your major or college living learning communityLake for Exploratory Wright for Arts and Sciences etc. If your major doesnt have a LLC Id recommend this any of the Eastway halls. After this summer every residence halls will have AC so dont worry about that. ,KentStateUniversity,cnrowtw,5,t5_2sau4
