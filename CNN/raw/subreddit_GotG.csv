1167576,0,t3_27hlwu,I think thats the only Rocket Raccoon figure Ive seen so far I completely liked. I was starting to think the onslaught of merchandising may not actually get me. But that I would buy. ,GotG,ci0z0mr,2,t5_2yzen
1225428,0,t1_ci78y4b,Oh god nooo! haha Bendis has been doing a terrible job on GotG. I swear to you go back and pick up the Annihilation stuff first and then come back to the current run. Annhilation  War of Kings  Thanos  Imperative are what the movies are based off of and are what really made the Guardians the characters we love today.,GotG,ci7h90k,1,t5_2yzen

4167159,0,t1_crv824i,Hate to disagree but Starhawk is a terrible choice. He is incredibly powerful so it really wouldnt fit with Peter Quills down to earth persona.A much better choice would be Starfox Watch the movie again and notice how many times Peter Quill manages to charm his way out of trouble. He manages to convince Drax not to kill Gamora Rocket not to kill Drax and Yondu not to kill him twice. He is also legendary for his Pelvic sorcery.On top of that it makes Thanos his uncle so gives him a personal stake in stopping him.,GotG,crv9iqi,8,t5_2yzen
