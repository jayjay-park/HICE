128642,0,t1_cese3s4,Its mostly sugarcoated sexnegative BS with a sprinkling of TERF quotes. Most sexpositive people are perfectly aware that heteronormativity and racial fethizisation are bad things.,SRSSex,cet2x4e,10,t5_2tl94
958834,0,t1_chcdzfl,I guess I can kinda buy that. I appreciate you taking the time to share your perspective even though I do hope I can still find some answers for what I should be doing. I feel really embarrassed and ashamed by all my thoughts and feelings around this so its good to get it out and put words to it and get nonjudgemental feedback.,SRSSex,chda13f,2,t5_2tl94

7599433,0,t1_d360jan,Well first off attractive isnt a scale  its a spectrum. For example my partner hates his nose and I love it. Im not weird and neither is he we just have different tastes on the spectrum. So you may believe you are unattractive compared to your tastes while others may not. shrug Just a thought.Second I dont even have friends and Im partnered! Seriously give yourself time to do what you need to do while also paying attention to your romantic needs. If you have romantic needs at all! Its okay if you dont too. However masturbating and fantasy isnt going to set you up for failure in the dating world because you imagined someone you perceive as more attractive than you. Keep a clear line between fantasy and reality and youre good.,SRSSex,d360n0w,2,t5_2tl94
