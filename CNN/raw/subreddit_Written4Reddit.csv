8493977,0,t3_4vyuww,Not trying to nitpick or anything I just wanted to imagine this for a second. The writer talked about a  horsepower motorcycle. Its most likely a chopper from the sound of it. Dirk the savage would only ride something that fierce across an alien desert planet ala Heavy Metal. To put that into perspective the fastest production motorcycle is the Suzuki Hayabusa     Named after the Japanese name of Peregrine Falcon the fastest bird in the world which flies at a speed of  mph. At a top speed of  miles per hour the Suzuki Hayabusa could even beat the Peregrine falcon. It is the fastest yet superbike from Suzuki. The ultimate Hayabusa superbike features a  cc fourcylinder  valves liquid cooled engine that produces  horse power  rpm.Technically the fastest produced bike is the Dodge Tomahawk     At top speed of  mph the Dodge Tomahawk is the worlds fastest bike ever produce. This ultimate superbike was unveiled by Dodge in . It is very limited and reportedly only  bikes has been sold yet. Dodge Tomahawk features . liter V SRT  Dodge Viper engine. It can produce a maximum power of  horsepower. Unlike other superbikes Dodge Tomahawk is a fourwheeled bike  two front wheels and two rear wheels. Surprisingly Tomahawk bike could cross  to  mile in just . seconds.Now to ramp it up a notchDrag racing is already crazy enough. Can you imagine doing it on two wheels? Thats what Ten Time Top Fuel AMA Motorcycle Drag Bike Champion Larry Spiderman McBride does for fun. The U.S. drag racer went . mph for the official fastest quartermile on two wheels. I lowered the AMA Dragbike elapsedtime record to ..The bike weighs  lbs uses  gallons per run and is made of carbon fiber. The Engine is a cc PumaKawasaki with an estimated  horsepower. Now thats fast.So the chopper that Dirk is riding is most likely a literal Bat Out Of Hell.,Written4Reddit,d63ap8t,1,t5_3e2pr
