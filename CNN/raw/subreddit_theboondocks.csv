907018,0,t1_ch7dj9r,I definitely agree.  Their voices would be well suited for tv but I would be reluctant to write them into an episode as themselves.  If they were written in as themselves I feel it would be more We miss McGruder material.  If they wrote a hype man character for Chance maybe a Flav parody he could kill it.  I could see Tyler as a gritty crime boss Riley crosses paths with.  On the note of odd rap voices I could see Danny Brown working if he didnt play himself like the voice of a crackhead or relative of Uncle Rukus.If they got Obama to do a voice any voice I would lose it that would be amazing,theboondocks,ch7dtob,5,t5_2te1o

5103246,0,t3_3kup6i,A Date with the Health Inspector is an allegory of the drum up to the Iraq war. When Gin Rummy Rumsfeld and Ed Wuncler III George W. Jr. turn left instead of right to go catch the xbox killer pay close attention to the dialog for the rest of the episode.I dont have any wraps youre thinking of the Korean store north of here,theboondocks,cv14qcg,5,t5_2te1o
