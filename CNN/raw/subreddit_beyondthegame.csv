8523315,0,t3_4whd2x,Day  Baten Kaitos  is almost memetic in the speedrun community due to the fact that due to one item the  run has to be over two weeks long. I could not find any VODs or highlight reels of any of Baffansthe author and the only guy that runs BK   runs and his twitch page just links to this pastebin page so if you have any video that would be extremely helpful.EDIT Im severely retarded the highlights are at the bottom of the pastebin.Side Note Can someone link that Dark Souls no damage run? I promised myself when I started this project I wouldnt repeat games.,beyondthegame,d66z5jz,2,t5_3cvx8
10179245,0,t3_5lrhb4,Xpost from rCompetitiveoverwatchContext harbleu is using Roadhog a character with a cooldown ability that lets him hook players and pull them towards him. He first faces an enemy D.Va whose ultimate very long cooldown ability is to jump out of her mech suit and send the mech at the enemy as a big bomb. harbleu hooks the bombmech in midair some people dont even know you can do this but before the mech reaches him he interposes a bit of indestructible scenery. That way the mech explodes out of range of his teammates AND harbleu is shielded from the explosion.harbleu then sees an enemys McCree right as he was activating his own ultimate which kills everyone in sight and hooks and shoots him down before the ultimate can finish.ampnbspe rCompetitiveoverwatch has a longer explanation postgt TLDR A player was able to neutralize three very dangerous charged abilities using a basic ability and then his own charged ability.gt A professional player harbleu playing for the uppermid tier team compLexity based in North America is playing Roadhog a hero thats currently considered a bit overpowered but whom harbleu was doing amazing things with before it was such a commonly used hero.gt He used his hook a regular ability on a sixsecond cooldown to neutralize one of the enemy teams ultimate abilities very powerful abilities that charge over time and charge faster when the players are doing well. First he used the hook to drag away from his teammates the giant glowing explosive ball in reality a mech suit set to selfdestruct. That ability can onehit any character in the game unless theyre behind cover behind the giant blue shield that you saw at the beginning of the clip or buffed by one of a few abilities that gives temporary health and even then its usually not enough.gt Six seconds later he used the hook to neutralize a second enemy ultimate from the glowing cowboy. That ultimate is a charged shot that can again onehit anyone not in cover but while it was charging the hook canceled it out and harbleu killed the coyboy.gt harbleu then used his own ultimate a stream of bullets shooting out of his gun that pushes opponents back it can do a lot of damage if the opponent cant move but usually the shots push the opponent back so they dont take most of that damage. The giant guy with the hammer had just been given a nanoboost an ultimate by another character offscreen but wasnt able to do anything with it. Edit The giant guy with the hammer wasnt boosted but he was still trapped so he died to Roadhogs ultimate which usually just pushes people away.,beyondthegame,dbxvgim,1,t5_3cvx8
