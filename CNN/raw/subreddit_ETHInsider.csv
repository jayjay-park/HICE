10862431,0,t1_de0drou,Alright I invited a couple more people. It would be great if we could achieve a healthy mix of skeptics traders longterm hodlers enthusiasts. If you want any people to be invited just post them here,ETHInsider,de0dsvi,3,t5_3j44v
10943389,0,t1_de3m46q,Thanks for this wall of text. It helped me a lot to understand this ETF. How would you rate the SolidX ETF in comparison? Do you think it is more likely to be approved?,ETHInsider,de8qes3,2,t5_3j44v

11053524,0,t3_5wn66n,I hope you bought some cheap eth Sunday its going to be a glorious day and week. The skulls we will be cracking will be fiat. ,ETHInsider,dekwcdm,2,t5_3j44v
11092597,0,t1_depb8rg,Exactly! But the ETH rise was not just EEA pump it was also partly ETF pump meaning we have already established that fiat now follows BTC potentially extrapolating pumps due to superior fundamentals and it makes sense too. A lack of very large ETH sellers makes it very easy to lift the ETH fiat price when BTC rises  as we have witnessed alreadyBut I have ofc thought about your concerns. You have too much downside in BTC it is safer to buy ETH and get a leveraged BTC short as a hedge IMO,ETHInsider,depc3pj,2,t5_3j44v
11116243,0,t1_derzvuv,Yep that blew  sorry gents. Hopefully your eth offset the btc ,ETHInsider,des0m9z,1,t5_3j44v

11350552,0,t3_61yflp,I created this the other day but didnt get round to putting it hereSo Im calling it  . before the end of April.I know this sounds a bit optimistic but I can sort of see the th wave this is ETHBTC Im talking about now not ETHEUR on this chart has some striking similarities with the rd wave.The rd wave had a small hiccup from . to . then a much bigger one from . to .. Remarkably my DeMark D indicator called . a buy and the ratio zoomed up to . in a few weeks before DeMark said sell. The . gt . support line was even more aggressive than the goblintown gt . one.In hindsight the small hiccup was the th subsubwave of the rd subwave of wave  this is getting complicated I know. And the big hiccup was subwave  of wave .I think the ratio is basically replaying that scenario on wave . This time the small hiccup was the price retracing from . to .. And the big hiccup is underway now retracing from . to wherever the ratio sinks down to.So Im suggesting that we are in Wave  subwave  and very close to the end of subsubwave .I have some DeMark indicators on Coinbase that are saying ETHBTC  will soon be a strong buy. The D is at Green . The D is at Green .  The h is at Green .In short my prognosis is the ratio needs to kick out these last  subsubwaves which might take  days I suppose then its time for wave  subwave  where the socalled flippening might occur.If you want to scalp the top thats coming in  days my advice would be to not be too greedy. If you sell and hold out for  EUR you might be disappointed.I may have even been the first one to write about the flippening I had a discussion with ublangbus about it last year and he hadnt considered it before but thought it was an interesting idea. So it was new to him at the time. I wish it had a better name now though.Edit some numbers.,ETHInsider,dfikbkj,8,t5_3j44v

11624831,0,t1_dgc5hzb,If your trading alts provided its a minority of core holdings then leaving on exchange is fine. Youll need to as altcoin trading can occur over shorter sudden timeframes and youll need access to an exchange to do this.,ETHInsider,dgdopvn,2,t5_3j44v
11687307,0,t1_dgkqsi5,Good for you! I am taking a position now thanks again wouldnt have spotted this normally. I am also reluctant to trade since I often screw it up or sell too early  but it is too profitable for me at the moment. I know I am a decent researcher and good at spotting formations so that makes up for the the not so great TA overall. So far I am doing well You can always start with really small positions that would be my advice for people that have been burned before always keep it small until you have more experience ,ETHInsider,dgkrvb4,3,t5_3j44v
