3945415,0,t3_35nbk8,Mob Spawning  Its the lack of caves on this map.  Play on a superflat world and youll see the same craziness.  The mobs need to spawn somewhere on a chunk.  Without caves theyre forced to the surface.  If you dig mines and leave them dark the mobs on the surface will decrease in that area.  Perhaps it was my time with the VAAST server and flatcore before coming here but I love the challenge of the increased mobs.  It actually feels like youre taking back the wilderness this way by lighting things up and building barriers. When the sun rises I venture out to my work site and work as hard as I can through the day.  As the sun starts to set I quickly finish up so I can be back and secure in my settlement before the arriving herd of mobs can overwhelm me.  At night I work within my settlement chat with my neighbors and patrol for any intruders.  Feels much more accomplished when Im able to expand the borders and force the mobs back.  Seriously when was the last time you actually felt threatened by hostile mobs on the surface in Minecraft?  Maybe your first few hours playing the game?  They cant keep up with us as it is why nerf em?I vote to keep the mobs as they are.  HOWEVER Citadel needs to protect against Creeper explosions.

You convieniantly leave out details to everything. Ive been nothing but nice to you and from what Ive seen Obore treated you just like they treat everyone. Orodwen is massive so it would take a while to hold your hand and tell you where everything is. Much easier to wait for them to ask. And most people enjoy getting their own things so I can understand why they wouldnt just throw gear at you. Did you ask for gear? For directions? Because you cant get mad at Obore for not giving you things you didnt ask for.This all just seems like a way to do something different because your character is stale. And thats fine! But dont try and make it all a thing against Obore. We treated you better than we should have and you stab us in the back because of it.

Itd be cool if large parts of the map have very few ores with a whole lot of ores being concentrated in various locations around the map. The amateur prospector in me would love to have to dig and prospect for ores and then have the joy of striking a jackpot of ore itd also be cool to have mining towns spring up in these areas.,TheRealmsMC,cyrhw2b,1,t5_37pvn

7299811,0,t3_4fdqn7,Well firstly from me and the UNR thank you for sticking with this. while we accept it took a tad longer than merely getting as many people as you can to meet up on team speak for an hour to discuss it the UNR method of careful refinement and revision has borne its first fruit. we now give you legislation that while relatively minor in the grand scheme of server politics it is an inclusive and fair piece of legislation discussed by people regardless of the fact they had the time to attend a meeting at a specific time. thank you to all who participated and we hope for far greater things to come.Now on to the resolution itself. the Standards of the Sea formerly named the laws of the sea before it was changed as the main body of the text is regarding specifications and regulations and there is little in the way of binding laws in it is an international standard that sets out common sense rules of shipping essentially dont steal ships cargo while its in your port and protect foreign ships to the best of your ability if you are in a war.it also lays the foundations of two institutions to protect and improve shipping. It creates the Ship registry a new tool similar to that run in sphera which should help allow the reporting of stolen or lost ships. and there there are the standards for containerization. this is a system new to the server which we feel will greatly help the swift and efficient transport of cargo over land sea and air. it allows ships of varying size to carry the same cargo allowing a ships entire cargo to be taken off the boat and onto shore in a matter of minutes or to be effortlessly transferred onto another from of transport such as a hydroline. this system even includes classification of cargo so nations can see what is in them without breaking open the box.If your nation has not done so already please appoint a delegate to the UNR by sending a message to either me or uNOTredtao so your nation can gain a voice in international lawmaking. Each nation is permitted two delegates but only one may vote on any one piece of legislation.so once again thank you and let us go onward and build the future of this world togetherEdit recreated post due to it linking to incorrect and inconvenient place.,TheRealmsMC,d27xt61,3,t5_37pvn

You may want to claim your own land or join a nation. You can protect your land with the citadel plugin. To protect it donlcg Name of CitadelThis creates the citadel. You can name it anything you want.ctr Name of CitadelThis allows you to reinforce blocks. Reinforcements can be destroyed if a block is broken a certain amount of times. You need a certain block to reinforce with each block reinforcing for different amounts.Emerald  Diamond  Gold  Iron  Stone  Just right click the block you want to reinforce with any of these materials after doing ctr and they will be reinforced. Stone reinforces for  breaks while Emerald reinforces for  breaks. You dont really need to reinforce houses as it is griefing to destroy them In same cases you can destroy structures. If they built it on your land you can probably destroy them.,TheRealmsMC,d4858gc,3,t5_37pvn
