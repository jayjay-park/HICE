1453580,0,t1_cix1o6n,So I think it is important to look at what the poster is really arguing and how we can break that down into parts that we can examine. I think they are trying to say  The out of wedlock birth rate is higher than previous generations there is no time limit stated but lets say past  years  Feminism is in large part to blame for this  People have a harder time forming amp maintaining families  Feminism is in large part to blame for this too. My first thought is that we have to be careful not to conflate all out of wedlock births as resulting from the same conditions nor creating the same conditions. So separating out demographics might be useful. Age is one way to do that. Id argue that teenage pregnancies are the most likely to be problematic because they are usually accidental are more likely to cause health problems for mother amp child are almost always out of wedlock are highly disruptive to expected social norms for teenagers in America causing difficulty in achieving education amp career goals and are the most likely to hurt those involved socially shaming financial burdens being ostracized etc. In other words if out of wedlock children are indeed causing social problems thats the demographic where wed see the most impact. If their numbers are declining though that suggests a positive trend rather than a negative. Whether feminism has anything to do with that I think is pretty dubious but it does suggest that in that arena things are improving. Older adults as we discussed above have children out of wedlock for a variety of reasons and not all of them lead to negative family conditions for the child. More and more couples are choosing not to marry but they may still be committed and raise children in a positive environment. Likewise gay couples may not be allowed to marry but may both still be wonderful dedicated parents. In both situations kids still have two engaged parents regardless of marriage status. Some single people are also choosing to adopt or have children naturally and they have the finances or social resources to have strong networks grandparents friends hiring an au pair etc. so that the child is raised in a positive attentive environment. Note that Im not arguing that all out of wedlock children are raised in good conditions or happy homes. Merely that out of wedlock doesnt necessarily tell us enough to evaluate whether the home life is a problem or whether they are having difficulty forming family bonds. We can look at premarital sex as one way of seeing how social mores towards sex have changed or havent changed. Surveys regarding sex are of course problematic. People frankly lie about sex. A lot. Surveys can also be poorly worded. And as you point out sometimes researchers have bias though it is important not to dismiss a study just because we dislike the researcher. Studies do show some disputes about these numbers so Ill share another one. This study suggests Among those born in the s and turning  from  to   had had premarital sex by exact age  and  had done so by exact age  for more recent cohorts turning  from  to  at least  had done so by exact age  it is comparing multiple surveys which is why the age ranges vary.  isnt a huge leap but we do see a large increase in the age at first sex vaginal penetration. Second wave feminism really took off in the early s  many point to the  The Feminine Mystique as a major catalyst. So if feminism is to blame and lets assume he means second wave we wouldnt see that impact in demographic trends until after . But it is hard to say exactly what role feminism played in the larger sexual revolution trend and in fact many feminists critiqued the sexual revolution. But Friedans book did influence the idea that women could be sexual beings and the pill impacted the freedom people felt about having sex.But the larger issue that the poster has isnt necessarily about sex. In fact it seems that he would like premarital sex with women. So feminisms role in loosening closely held ideas about sex actually might not be an issue for him. What he does seem to dislike is the family aspect. So what about out of wedlock births? They did absolutely increase since  pretty drastically. But they leveled off in the s. Again that might suggest that the negative trend he sees might not reflect current situations. The CDC article points out that this trend is also associated with the increase of cohabitation without marriage as well as the fact couples were less likely to marry when they found out about the pregnancy. I dont have statistics for this but marrying due to pregnancy is not necessarily going to lead to a happy home life and positive family bonding. So a reduction in that isnt necessarily a bad thing. And the cohabitation of unmarried parents I mentioned earlier as a situation that isnt necessarily bad. In other words I still dont think that gets at our issue. Nor do I think that lack of interest in marrying is necessarily just about feminism  men are also making this choice because they dont want to be bound to someone just because the condom broke ampor because they dont want to participate in marriage. Now you brought up divorce as one way to look at the issue and certainly no one would disagree that divorce is very hard on children and disruptive to families. It is important though to remember that divorce isnt again just about feminism.  It is a fallacy to think about it as complacent men just holding unhappy wives captive until feminism came along and allowed them to leave. Men dont want to be stuck in loveless marriages either. Changing norms about divorce allowed both genders the ability to escape toxic situations. And divorce is about more than just social ideals. When we look at divorce rate trends one interesting thing we see is a relationship to economic situations. In  divorce rates in the US hit a  year low. That timing corresponds with the economic crash and some have suggested a correlation Of course if you look at the CDC charts youll see that those divorce rates were declining since the s. Dana Rotz at Harvard argues that this is largely due to the increase in age at which women are marrying But she also argues that more egalitarian ideas about parental amp spousal roles in the home have led to a decrease in fighting and more marital satisfaction. If feminism had a role in that more egalitarian approach in family planning and in waiting until after college to marry then it has positively impacted marriages and family formations. Of course this isnt something we can have a clear cut obvious hard number approach to. It is way too complex to just say one thing causes something as complex as divorce or a happy marriage. But I do think we can say feminism  bad marriages is problematic and at least overly simplistic. ,BadSocialScience,ciyhcab,2,t5_31tpf

2735102,0,t3_2rdij7,I read through the old thread on a similar chart and I want to say I disagree.  Ingelharts World Values Survey work is actually really foundational for a lot of the work I do.  His book with Pippa Norris the Sacred and the Secular is pretty amazing for what it is.  Ditto Rising Tide.  Admittedly this chart is as much parlor trick as social science but the underlying research that produced this chart is both phenomenal and groundbreaking.  And the conclusions that can be drawn from this chartthat certain values cluster around certain intuitive supranational cultural groupings and that these are often supranational groupings are often geographically and religiously defined using religion here very broadlyare old ones dating anecdotally back very far but in a methodologically rigorous way at least to Durkheims Suicide.  I think Ingelharts work very carefully points out that these groupings exist while avoiding anything particularly deterministic or anything that even has a whiff of Huntingtons Clash of Civilizations.Its only because international survey programs like the WVS and of which the WVS is both the best and the most widely available that I will easily be able to extend the arguments I make for one country to other countries.Even with this specific chart you can quibble about the titles Confucian could be East Asian or a variety of other things for instance and you can quibble over exact groupings we could break up English Speaking into Catholic and nonCatholic Mali and Malaysia minimally should be Islamic if we accept Islamic as the proper term to define that cluster and Zimbabwe Zambia and Ethiopia are definitely not Islamic and you can certainly quibble with the spelling Ruanda?  Tansania? and you will notice that some countries just arent where youd expect them to be Israel omitted Cyprus inc. North Cyprus? Vietnam maybe one or two others but  or countries in this data are  off whack thats pretty good.  Thats saying that these clusters of countries arent either arbitrary or just geographically defined.  And a lot of those have to do with this whackness of this particular version of the chart.  You can overlay income clusters and find something you can overlay culturalreligious groupings you can overlay geographical groupings which are unsurprisingly similar to culturalreligious groupingsthe color isnt really the biggest deal that you can paint so many logical lines here is also a big deal.  Theres something there whether we can all agree what that something is another thing.  Perhaps most interestingly if Im not mistaken these groupings made more sense and called for fewer explanations with earlier waves of data which makes an interesting case for globalization processes changing regional values etc. But mainly I want to defend the project and data that undergirds this map.tldr fuck all the haters WVS still dope as fuck.,BadSocialScience,cneywb8,4,t5_31tpf

I love diversity and do not seek to label or pigeonhole anyone but in general certain types of people like certain things and understanding these demographics is not the same thing as saying ALL people which fit into a demographic are the same.gt Well girls like different things than guys. Culture has taught us that heroic men save the world while heroic women successfully create families. This is not only in our culture but is ingrained in our biology. Strong women get and keep a mate who helps them raise children. They create a strong family unit that supports and loves one another. Men protect their families nations and world from danger and are biologically controlled by a desire to impregnate as many females as possible. gt So a male power fantasy is to save his family tribe andor world. A female power fantasy is a romance novel in which she secures an amazing husband and they live happily ever after. I use the fairy tale ending purposefully there because that is our culture! The happily ever after isnt a guy who lives alone has great friends different girlfriends and kids he visits once a week to take out to dinner and ask about school before complaining to those same children about child support. Happily ever after is the female power fantasy of safety support love and security for her family.gt Plus even if the female power fantasy IS protecting the world and for some women that is true Bayonetta is hypersexualized. I mentioned this before but do you think guys would enjoy Devil May Cry if Dante were wearing skimpy spandex with peakaboo cutouts everywhere that framed his junk and like boob physics the junk was simulated to become excited and grow as he built combos? How would you like it if during a special move he became naked laughed seductively into the camera and floated into the air artfully obscuring ONLY his junk?gt Youd probably find it funny. . . but then we guys are not girls and our biology makes it so that wed LOVE to constantly be treated like sex objects whereas women whose biology tells them to find a single mate who will support and help her care for their young are not similarly inclined. gt So you know Bayonetta is a fun game and sexualizing female characters honestly isnt that big of a deal because this is entertainment made for men. Its also not a big deal that ridiculous amounts of romanticism and heroic loyalty and sacrifice are major themes about men in romance novels made for women. Women and men are different and art created for the enjoyment of one gender more than the other is fine. gt The next time you talk to a lady who thinks games like Bayonetta are garbage because they sexualize women politiely ask her if she thinks that Stephanie Meyers novels or romance novels in general are trash because they romanticize men. That might move the discussion away from angry activism for womens rights vs. activism for freedom of speech and take it to a deeper and more intelligent conversation about criticizing art for dishonest themes that appeal to one or the other sexes through lies. gt Because thats Bayonettas only real crime that its bad art because its dishonest.

Other geneticists disagree. Current consensus is that if there is such a connection its a unclear it has anything to do with the Khazars in specific and b a minor contribution to Ashkenazi genetics at most and a larger source is ancestry shared with other Jews.As for the what part British Israelism is a fascinating thing and its racist American manifestation Christian Identity is even more so.,BadSocialScience,cqk42fj,2,t5_31tpf

4000237,0,t1_crbe2ym,Youre baking a lot of assumptions into your response but you arent endeavoring to demonstrate why theyre true youre mostly assuming. Why is hazing a healthy way to determine someones aptitude instead of say professionally created and administered aptitude tests? The Russian military has enacted several policies to attempt to curtain the practice of dedovshchina among the ranks a form of hazing that is often abused by more senior military members for an easier life where more senior soldiers will force the junior soldiers to perform their duties and such. When the junior soldiers dont comply theyre typically beaten for it which has resulted in no shortage of suicides when recruits are worn down by the cycle of abuse.No doubt youd say this is bad hazing but hazing by its very nature endures because of societys ambivalent view of it. At the macro level we often look on agasp at its more overt abuses but at the micro level we shrug off what we see happening around as boys being boys. The problem is that those aforementioned serious abuses rely on the permissiveness of the latter. The suggested attitude you have towards hazing is moreorless the status quo no one thinks hazing is good when they see its excesses but everyone ignores it when they can rationalize it as harmless then the more serious abuses occur when the cameras arent on and no one is watching. Few people deign to come forward for the fear of the impact it will have on their social status.Lets return to the subject of dedovshchina theres actually a really interesting paper PDF warning on this topic that makes the claim that the practice of hazing in the Russian military has eroded unit cohesion. One citation in the paper refers to a study that claims the practice of dedovshchina accounts for as much as  of causalities among Russian military recruits in the Chechen area. A consistent note when discussing morale is how much the practice of hazing undermined morale those units with strong traditions of dedovshchina often broke under fire and had higher rates of desertion than those who didnt Russian conscripts captures by the Chechen rebels often reported on how much better the Chechens and fed and treated them than their own units.Targets of hazing are expected to stoically endure it even when the excesses go too far and someone is seriously injured. It can also be used as a litmus test to determine who will ignore the group when they do blatantly illegal things. If you let your college buddies shove something up your ass to prove yourself to them why wouldnt they expect you to turn a blind eye as theyre carrying a woman passedout drunk into a bedroom? If your friends on your construction crew watched you endure their own hazing why wouldnt they expect you to ignore OSHA violations when they cut corners or use illadvised techniques to finish their jobs quicker?Theres actually a lot I could say on the expectation of quiet stoicism in the workplace such as how an expectation like that could result in ignoring all of the terrible hazing practices I just mentioned. Or how it can lead a person to ignore an injury and come in to work anyway for fear of being thought of as weak. In fact I actually fail to see why stoicism would be that great of a boon anyway. It seems to me like stoicism is used more as excuse to force people into accepting the status quo no matter how terrible it is. No one wants to rock the boat for fear being labelled a pussy and emasculated by your peers.gt  Theres much of toxic masculinity that simply needs to go. But we should endeavor to understand why these aspects of it exist and if they serve any purpose.This is coming from a confusion over terminology if its productive and nonharmful by definition it is not toxic masculinity.gt Why is there so little discussion on the causes of toxic masculinity here and elsewhere?Why are you assuming we dont know the causes?,BadSocialScience,crc9bit,3,t5_31tpf

8446977,0,t1_d5valeu,I kind of dont believe postmodernism exists. I think its just a messy set of critiques of bad ideas that dont necessarily have a common root. The critique usually stated is so wide it can essentially be applied to anybody before the nineteenth century even those of supremely good sense like Burke Samuel Johnson and Kant. Its more that the critique is so ubiquitous that people wont take an argument seriously until they hear that term. Even so I think if we are talking about antireality sneering which Camille Paglia and Nietzsche often critique it most certainly applies to Natheism. But personally I think Foucault is wrong and dumb and Dawkins is wrong and dumb. Theyre not wrong and dumb for the same reason but people trotting around the postmodernism for Foucault assuming that that will fully take care of it while assuming Dawkins is safe is really wrong and dumb in itself.Even so Dawkins is clearly shitty semiotics as abusive as Barthes Hitchens is clearly an awful form of speechact theory and Harris perpetually tries to be a phenomenologist under different monikers.,BadSocialScience,d5xer4w,1,t5_31tpf

9740649,0,t1_dadpouh,gtSimple theyre probably still telling the truth. This podcast has a pretty good story on it. Gender fluidity is also a thing.This is certainly a fascinating case study but it really hints at some underlying brain condition. This person is mentally ill by nearly any definition. At the very least if not mild dissociative identity disorder this person likely has some kind of personality disorder or some very odd schemas the testosterone decline could even conceivably be a psychosomatic symptom. The part about finding a great deal of meaning in the discipline provided by the navy certainly suggests this very strongly. I mean what makes a mental illness? You have statistical abnormality clinical distress impaired functioning.Did you know that the internet has people claiming to be multiple? Multiple persons existing in one body? Did you know the internet also has people claiming to be animals existing in human bodies? This may simply be failure of imagination on my part but I dont know how to see these people as anything other than either narcissistic or deluded. I see no reason to validate them. But for that matter and I am probably in the wrong here  I see very little reason to validate anyone other than like your spouse and children and very close friends.gtYour philosophy is throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Sure the typical American individualism is wrong. You cant will yourself out of poverty or systemic oppression but there are some things that are genuinely dependent on selfidentification. You cant go so far the other way that all selfdetermination is meaningless. Thats just as unfounded.Why?gtHeres an unintuitive conclusion you were right each time because like mentioned above gender can be fluid. I admittedly spoke to strongly when I said a trans woman was never a man. Thats mostly because a lot of trans people express not ever feeling like they actually were the gender they were born as so its like that although they didnt begin identifiying as a woman its likely she never really fully identified as a man either.I dont agree. I was confused and a fantastist who had a belief that I was something other than a physical organism inhabiting a physical body. You know what helped? Psychedelics and death. Lots of psychedelics and lots of time to think. I basically retreated from life for two years after the death of a very close friend. And I came to the realization that Descartes was wrong when he said I think therefore I am. There is no me doing the thinking. This sense of selfawareness on some level is just a thought that this body is having.On what is gender To the extent that it actually differs from biological sex gender like any social construct exists in the social space between people. It does not describe an actual property of people any more than grammatical gender of nouns in German and French every noun has a gender describes actual properties of those nouns.

So they figure theyll fight back along the same lines and actually show some biology to suggest opposite conclusions using the logic of the antiLGBTer. But obviously it doesnt tend to work because firstly the antiLGBTers logic was inherently flawed and secondly the antiLGBTers position isnt actually based on biology so contradictory biological facts wont affect them.
