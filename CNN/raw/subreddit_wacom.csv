2034183,0,t3_2hy3rm,Well it depends on how badly you think you need a companion.  Since it was their first product in this field its certainly not perfect.  I believe in an interview the CEO of Wacom said that they learned a lot from building it which would hopefully inspire confidence regarding a version .  I believe weve also just passed or are nearing a year since its release and they recently lowered the price even further.  Of course Wacom doesnt do yearly releases so any assumptions on that part would be a crapshoot.Having owned a companion for a little over six months here are some complaints I have that may help you decide.The screen sucks.   adobe rgb color accuracy is unacceptable for a screen used for this medium.  The resolution is fine but at this point should be higher.  There is light bleed along the bottom that Wacom considers within spec.  Brightness is good however.The power button is in a bad place and is activated too easily.  Just being in the carrying case they give you theres a chance itll get turned on and sit in a thick neoprene case with no ventilation.  This has happened a dozen times with me.  Wacom suggested I turn the companion around in the case which did nothing.  It has reached a point where I dread the moment Im about to pull it out of my bag because I know that if the case feels hot its been running for a mystery amount of time.The power jack has problems.  Many people including myself have complained about this and had to send in their companions for repair.  This gets us to the next problem...Their customer support kind of sucks.  Theyll get back to you quickly enough but are rarely to never helpful.  And if you run into trouble sending something in for repair is  days for them to get it  days for them to repair it and another  days to send it back.  Oh and you have to pay to ship it to them in the US.On a side note I was disappointed to learn that it cant function like a regular cintiq.The portability is fantastic especially being able to draw with it like a sketchbook without having anything sticking out.  For the most part the joint pen and touch works well although I commonly have to turn it off when Im drawing or I get spots all over my work if I lift my pen too high.  If you have or have had a chance to use the HD it functions identically.All in all I love the drawing experience but not the owning experience.  Im sure that on version  they will at least have fixed the power button and jack issues.  The others I doubt.  Hopefully this will help.,wacom,ckye0yc,2,t5_2v5v2

4804867,0,t1_ctxyem1,To be honest I dont notice much of a difference. I use pretty light strokes myself and had to tweak the sensitivity to be able to get some variation in thickness  which I believe I also did with my old tablet when I started to take advantage the pen pressure. Im not the greatest at getting smooth lines to begin with but it seems pretty good to me.I originally had the pressure sensitivity off as when I first started using a tablet it was like I suddenly had flippers instead of hands so for years I was just trying to get actual lines instead of squiggles.,wacom,cu06yyy,1,t5_2v5v2

6686686,0,t1_d0ae3ak,The first one is a newer iteration of the same line of entrylevel tablets. So it would make sense to get that one... except...You might consider the eraser at the end of the pen. Actually the lack of it. Apparently they got rid of that. Now to erase youll have to assign a hotkey to it instead of turning the pen upside down and do it automatically. That said I know very few people that use the eraser end of wacom pens. I for one prefer to use a hotkey.If youre unsure about this get the second one.If you definitely know itll be ok get the latest model.Good luck and happy painting!,wacom,d0aymrs,1,t5_2v5v2

It takes me less effort to make a mark and the pressure adjustability can make it even more sensitive. I dont need it to be that sensative.

10412659,0,t3_5oq2rx,This is the most consistent bug I encounterSometimes when I wake the tablet from sleep the pen behaves differently. If I hovertrace the pen over the screen the cursor drags as if Im physically doing the dragmarquee select on the screen. It renders the pen useless when trying to interact with windows or software because it thinks Im constantly trying to drag objects around. While this is occurring I open the Wacom settings utility and observe that the pen pressure slider from soft to firm does no register pen input as in when I press and hold the pen the pressure bar doesnt animate. That leads me to think that the driver isnt behaving properly.The only solution for this that Ive discovered is to sleepwake the device until the bug goes away or to do a full restart.,wacom,dcocces,4,t5_2v5v2
10453826,0,t3_5pqnpj,That depends on what you are trying to achieve digitally. Painting start to finish digitally? Inking and coloring your scanned pencil sketches? Line work? Keeping sketchy lines but want to add color? Your budget? Working digitally also requires practice to reach the same level as you would traditionally as it is a new medium and requires time to develop the muscle memory for the strokes learn the tools and how to set them how you want etc.Lets hear what you ideally want to be doing and go from there. EditVery generic break down of stuff I am familiar withLineworkSoftwareSketchbook Pro Clip Studio Paint Paint tool SAIHardware Cintiqs preferably. That or draw your lines traditionally and then scan them. It can be done with an Intuous but it generally involves more refinement iterations than on a Cintiq or traditional. Digital PaintingCorel Painter Photoshop Clip Studio PaintHardware doesnt matterDigital EffectsSoftware Photoshop Clip Studio PaintHardware doesnt matterNo fuss sketching and gesture drawingsSoftware Made with MischiefHardware depends whether you prefer aiming for quick clean line work or notYou can do absolutely everything with Photoshop but it also has probably the largest learning curve and setup time as well as being expensive. Still it remains the professional standard for a reason.Clip Studio Paint is a lot cheaper than Photoshop and a lot easier to start getting clean linework done with. Sketchbook Pro is great for drawing Corel Painter is great for painting. All these programs except for Mischief easily import and export into each other.Mischief is an infinite canvas program with really super basic drawing and painting tools. Dont try and do any completed works on it just use it for gesture drawings hashing out ideas en mass and then you export whatever you like into a more feature rich program. ,wacom,dct1lpm,2,t5_2v5v2

10894511,0,t3_5oq2rx,Today my system would not turn on. It had been plugged in all night was working fine the night before. It was lagging slightly on a big photoshop file but otherwise was fine. I dont usually put things in sleep mode I shut it down. Tonight I went to use it and it wouldnt turn on. Tried plugging it into  different sockets. Might be important to note that before turning it on I had plugged one of those USB converters into one of the slots so I could charge my iPhone off of it. Im thinking that had something to do with it? It did eventually turn on when I switched outlets again but the weird thing is when it did finally turn on the battery was at  charge I dont see how it could have been a dead battery it was plugged in all night while it was turned off and I keep it plugged in while I use it.Any ideas what this could be?

11074456,0,t1_degoi5r,Look the MSP is a good investment. I personally know a guy that prefers using his tablet over his companion  and he says that its just not that great of an experience overall. I know the MSP is quieter has the parallax fixed and functionally faster. Now you could literally use the MSP at home AND at school. I dont understand why would you want a cintiq when you could also plug the MSP and use it as a cintiq at home anyway? as far as I know. But why would you? Anyway if I were you and assuming you could afford one  get the MSP for . mobility obviously . generally a nice investment for the next couple of years if youre planning to be making money with it.Not to mention that screen wise Ive seen that the MSP carries more aRBG s than the upcoming cintiq pros meaning a better screen.
