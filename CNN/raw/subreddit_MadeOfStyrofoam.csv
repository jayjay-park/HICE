6724915,0,t1_d0euzg2,gt I feel that nobody else should be able to tell me what I can or cant do with my own body. This includes cutting suicide selfmutilation whatever. Its MY choice and I am not okay with them using various manipulative tactics to make me stop. Its usually the beginning of the end when I explain this.I think this is a reasonable way of thinking. Everyone should have the right to live their life how they want to with the exception of harming others. Its their choice not mine. And I believe that there can be a twisted kind of satisfaction in selfdestruction and I imagine it could be quite compelling to indulge in it. Though I would say its not fair to live by this notion if they had kids because as parents you should be considerate of them too. If someone is not willing to do that they shouldnt have kids.Hm seems like you have quite a dystopian view of the future. If I had kids I would hope that I would be able to teach them things that would help them improved the world amp our communitys. And if many people do this maybe someday this world will be a good place for almost everyone to live on. This is my hope.So you can guess I dont agree with your wish of having the human race go extinct. I dream that with time we will be able to solve all these problems you listed. Extinction of humanity would eradicate the possibility of a better future  ,MadeOfStyrofoam,d0ewxs1,1,t5_35jbl

9723177,0,t1_dabjn01,gtTherapy isnt about fixing an illnessWell then its treating the symptoms of an illness. I still find it stigmatising as long as it has a realation the word mental illness because the word illness itself suggests that the ill state is wrong and that there needs to be a cure. ill is at least I feel like that not a socially acceptable state to be in and therefore creates social pressure to change. And it gives the subliminal message that being a certain way is wrong. Id rather see it like differnt people having differnt types life experiences that cause different challenges not as illness. am I getting repetitive yet?gttreatment is rarely forced upon people If youre underage it can be forced on you by your parents dosent it? And someone of your friends family etc. telling you that there is something wrong with you is a form of force too imo social pressure.  gtI implore everyone ill nor not to visit a mental health professional and get a check up to make sure everything is still good.I guess if everyone actually did this there might also be less stigma. Still no way in hell Im way too paranoid of being put in a hospital against my will at some point in my life to do that.gthelps people be less ostracized for pursing help or keeps people afraid from being labeled different or sick since people that they look up to like celebrities are capable of searching for help. makes me feel like a bad singer in a dark empty stadium who suddenly has to be afraid that someone will turn the lights on and suddenly hundereds of people will see me and judge meAnyway these views amp feeling are probably a result of my personal experience and family realtionships.
