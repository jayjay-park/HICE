8768314,0,t1_d71a2cx,. I havent got much experience in frontend design but Ill try my best to build a demo. It would be great if someone could help implementing the library as a complete game using React and Redux.. I havent measured the difference between ECC and SRA but I have a benchmark suite available simulating a game of  players by running npm start.. It would be nice if there was an acceptable rate of crossbrowser support for WebRTC. Unfortunately most of the implementations are in development and not ready for production use. Until there is a better solution available Im planning to use a nontrusted thirdparty server combined with public key cryptography to bridge the communication gap between parties. Personally I like cryptocurrencies but in order to get a better user adoption rate FIAT deposits should also be allowed. CypherPoker should aim to be the most legal and transparent solution available on the market.. Game verification is already available APIwise if none of the players have disconnected during the game. Escrow and distribution of winnings in a PPcompatible way is a problem to be solved.. Yes dropout handling is not yet supported but  as mentioned on Slack  the best way to do it to date is penalizing intentionally disconnecting players financially or using smart contracts to let the keys of disconnected players be revealed soon after they get disconnected.,cypherpoker,d71pbmn,1,t5_34eev
