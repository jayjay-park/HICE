4558152,0,t1_ct536oa,Thank you! your playthroughs were great too!! I thought of doing that too since is what most people do with rhythm games but I cant play with my fingers like that only with my thumbs  ,ichu,ct569s8,1,t5_38hj2
4576396,0,t1_ct7g7vz,If you have  Twinkle Bell Rs at least one of them matching the attribute of the song you can get S rank on the song AND also net the total  bonus points from the tap score. Another thing I noticed the score bonus on expert actually doesnt give that much... If you get C rank on the song and only have twinkle bell cards you can still net k points from the EX play!Id recommend trying out a team of  twinkle bell members hey even one if you can get a LE guest bonus that has high points in the pop attribute! The tap bonus of  definitely outweighs the  points from score bonus. With  Rs from Twinkle Bell  Pop another Cool I get  points per easy play but the exp from ex songs is still tempting lol... i just play those when Im near leveling,ichu,ct7gn9s,1,t5_38hj2
4600980,0,t3_3dzkpo,is it actually still doing that? because you did miss a couple of patches if you only just started so theres a chance its just downloading them all one at a time though that would strike me as horribly inefficient.,ichu,ctajj80,1,t5_38hj2

6132903,0,t1_cyhjz2y,Ohh do they expire? Would you happen to know how long they last? I issued one when I started playing and I keep it safe in case something happens to my phone but if it has an expiration date then I need to remember to issue another in the future!,ichu,cymqw7q,1,t5_38hj2
6235949,0,t1_cyyge7a,Ill look at the guides and maybe theyll answer my questions. I do want to know one thing though what do the cooking bears do? Ive gotten a few from normal scouting with friend points and I fed them to Rs of the same colour and nothing spectacular happened.,ichu,cyygk2r,1,t5_38hj2

6640384,0,t3_461l2l,Im actually doing fine in this event.Reached the T easily with just  disks and like  candies. I think Ill get Shiki LE by tomorrow.Lol I edited it I wrote tier .Hell I wouldnt even reach tier  in a million of years.,ichu,d0668vw,1,t5_38hj2
7397188,0,t1_d2gducd,Oh my god I feel you.  The same happened to me when I gambled for Touyas event LEGR but oh well my wish was not granted. Are we cursed by Kyousuke because I did get his I think it was the initial LE and...  copies of his readingliterary cards. Drz ,ichu,d2j0fjx,1,t5_38hj2
7568574,0,t3_4izooy,Really interested in that enemy seal thing  even though I could get more than mil in a round I barely got  stars let alone  star lives. So yay more points!Might just tier for that beautiful card. I do need more GRs and Hijack events are my jam. I definitely wont procrastinate and get the LE in the last five minutes of the event in a massive crazy grind like I did with Noahs...,ichu,d32id8n,1,t5_38hj2

7788861,0,t3_4m06yx,Hmm probably i could be able to reach higher but Tour Events are really not my jam and i was still kinda tired from that Idolish event so im happy that i was even able to get my second copy .,ichu,d3riwas,1,t5_38hj2
8053256,0,t1_d4kzse7,I see i see nice! is a bit hurt bc I worked so hard for Aoi but everyone else is chill lmao Its good you got to play for other events v Thank you nyanka!!! ,ichu,d4l9fmi,1,t5_38hj2
8077508,0,t1_d4npu3f,It hasnt been said where the voting will occur I assume it will be on the site but well probably find out once the tickets are given out. Regardless it hasnt started yet  the popup in game is just to notify you that the site is up and you can view character posters.,ichu,d4nzjzr,1,t5_38hj2
8547797,0,t3_4wspr7,Good thing Ive been hoarding tickets been waiting for another chance to try for second copy of Christmas Issei or anyone else from that set,ichu,d6a1okc,1,t5_38hj2
8646705,0,t3_4ybku2,This was my first time going for T. I decided to T as Issei is my best boy and I wanted to be extra sure I could get the second copy plus extra disks are great. It wasnt too bad tbh. I had to put in a fair amount of candies but luckily I had an empty schedule this week so I could be efficent plus I am pretty lucky with Lancelot cards.I managed to end up rank ish as I woke up for the last rush getting war flashbacks of the hour of constant grinding I did for Hikarus group event and it actually wasnt THAT bad... I assume most the last hour chaos is at t and t so I guess thats why I managed to keep my spot.Overall fun event and I got my first GR of best boy yay!,ichu,d6mg6yy,1,t5_38hj2

10026860,0,t3_5j8pks,I was praying for it to be a jack event so I could use the ExcellentMarvelous rate up a bit more I still got like  LEs to idolize and  SRs to idolize RIP me but I guess this is okay as well although I secretly despise tour events because lag. This card looks so good like the art style of FF with dim light just looks so nice like on the Halloween Kanata LE.And those  crowns will be a great help to get the second copy of Rondo Ban and get closer to my goal of having all Bans GRs ,ichu,dbeizx7,3,t5_38hj2
