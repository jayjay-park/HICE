I keep all my music through Play Music in the cloud G Auto Backup for photos and Drive for everything else which works wonderfully by the way. And dont worry about a successor.

1291863,0,t1_ciexe47,I think price per unit is a more valuable point of view on it though. Especially with Motorola trying to solidify themselves as a great value but very high quality smartphone manufacturer. And they could just add the minuscule difference to the end consumer cost to recoup.The price per unit when were talking about  vs Gb is probably like some sub twenty or thirty dollar amount to a consumer. Probably less than ten for a manufacturer. In fact I wouldnt be surprised if having different set ups for building each storage size version eats up the difference.

1299635,0,t3_28yvtf,Its an electronic device with a lithium ion battery.Forceful immersion in water is going to damage it.A dehumidifier is not a bad technique however the rice thing is a very commonly misunderstood trick. Rice is a natural desiccant sure but for a tightly enclosed space such as a cell phone it cant dry it out.Taking the device apart and burying all the individual components in rice could be helpful. However if your able to fully disassemble it you could simply dry it off by hand and use some denatured alcohol to clean any rust  corrosion  lime scale off the components and their connectors.In most cases the first component to be damaged beyond repair is the battery then the digitizer  LCD. If all seems to be working with some slight issues take it to a repair shop as quick as possible.Bring in a phone still wet they have the best chance at saving it. Bring it in days  weeks  months later... damage is done.Liquid is a slow killer and far too many stick their phone in rice and its fine. Then it dies a week or a month later and they are flabbergasted.All that said sometimes liquid just does too much damage and there is no saving it backup as much data as you can while you can and seek out your options to either fix it or replace it.,MotoX,ciftqel,13,t5_2xebt
1306916,0,t1_cigmywg,actually there are  settings on there that will make the phone feel faster.  Basically google has set the speed for the open close animations and switching programs.  you can play with them nothing will break your phone with these three.Settings gt Developer options gt scroll down a little more than  way.  You will see Window animation scale Transition animation scale Animator duration scaleGo from x to .x or turn them off completely.If you want to see how it works throw it on x hit home and just watch how the animation scale works.  You can also select ART runtime to be your standard instead of davlik.  ART is supposedly betterfaster for your phone.  manymost apps are up to date with it already.  It will ask you to restart your phone while it optimizes all the apps. Depending on the number of apps this could take  minutes. To note Android . or . is supposed to have ART runtime as its standard so Moto will eventually throw you in there anyway.,MotoX,cign7vh,7,t5_2xebt

Its the difference that matters.Seems like your reading comprehension skills are lacking I pulled that quote from the same articlealso This is just an early look at Android Ls battery life. The current release is a developer preview but Google has already been able to make a meaningful difference in the runtime of L devices.

2076102,0,t1_cl3f61z,I ended up doing a factory reset last night while on the phone with Verizon support. Prior to the factory reset I was having the following issues  Moto Voice redirecting to Google Now Moto Voice randomly deciding when and when not to automatically read things back to me while I was driving or at home. SMS werent sending most of the time Cell Standby was using more battery than my screen all the time. I mean whether I used  hours SoT or  minutes SoT Cell Standby was always significantly higher than my screen. When I was on the phone with Verizon he decided to have me boot to Safe Mode. Safe Mode was completely fucked instead of just killing all rd party apps it was killing EVERYTHING. I couldnt even unlock the phone because Launcher  kept crashing I tried to open settings and that crashed and the antenna kept coming in and out because it was killing every service.I didnt do the factory reset until last night at about pm. So the only thing I could test last night was the Safe Mode booting worked perfect after the reset.So far today in the first  hours Ive been on my phone Ive observed the following Moto voice seems to be working significantly better now.  Ive sent about  texts this morning and all of them sent perfectly fine. And most of them were sent from the same exact spot I couldnt send from yesterday my desk at work. I have about  minutes SoT and my screen is about  higher on battery usage than my Cell Standby.So yeah if youre having these issues?

3178528,0,t3_2wb7cf,I had some issues with one illinformed chat rep and my attitude at the time was not the best.  Since then Ive had nothing but the best customer service. My Vday promo code didnt work at check out so I am waiting on a  refund and for the hassle they gave me the  off code for an accessory.         Fast forward to today.                      I realize I am just not happy with the color scheme I chose. The ring blends into the back and you cannot make out the engraving due to the gold font that was used. I emailed customer support. Within a few hours I had a prepaid shipping label to send my phone back and a code to order a new one. I now have  days to return the old phone once my new one arrives or of course I will be charged for it. The rep also threw in a free pair of headphones! To be clear there is nothing wrong with my device I just didnt like the colors that I chose...  I am impressed with the service that I received but I also think a little bit of politeness on our end as the customer goes a long way!

Since you want to be a cunt about itHere is my awesome  SOT  after hrs off charger after not touching my phone except to send a couple of texts and play KOTOR on the shitter. Like I said this isnt representative of my usual day. gtLol thats actually a  increase for the X mAhZ mAh. x   more battery life. Neither of us were right on the money but you were further from it and didnt even include a qualifier almost .gtGuess how large the battery in the ZC is? MAh. How long does it last? Longer than the Z.And what generation is it from? The same one as the Z aka the one that came out a year later than the  X. Youre comparing apples to oranges to pineapples to strawberries. If you want to compare the Moto to a Sony phone compare the X to the Z because those both came out within a few months of each other. gtLonger than the Z. And what youre talking about is an optional power saving feature.Its enabled by default. If you compare the two phones out of the box the Z will have a feature turned on that saves battery but reduces functionality.gtHaha that example is too good I dont like it.No you picked the phone with the best battery life of the next generation which also happened to have shitty sales compared to most of the other phones in the generation. You couldve talked about the GS One M or Nexus   all of which are actual competitors from the same generation as the X sold well and have similar battery lives. Why didnt you pick any of those? Because they arent the single outlier in the group. Look at this The X does better than the GS and One M. Like I said point me to a review where they say that the battery life is below average. ,MotoX,coyaiu0,1,t5_2xebt

3405988,0,t3_2z8755,The most confusing initially but best overall feature is Moto Display. The key thing to understand is that its separate from your lock screen. Your lock screen will display your background and notifications and has shortcuts to launch the phone or camera. Moto Display is solely for checking the time and notifications.Swiping rightleft from a notification on Moto Display will clear the notification symbol from Moto Display bit wont actually clear it from your lock screennotification tray. Get . Lollipop right away. Doubletwist to activate the camera is insanely useful but if you run with your phone in your pocket it sometimes has a false positive. Moto Voice is great for some people. Personally the number one use for it personally was showing my friends hey look what my phone can do. Its okay but its not totally  in terms of reliability yet.

3985318,0,t1_crac5kk,Can you pass on a suggestion to your superiors to pass on to their superiors and so on until it becomes industrystandard?  Its a simple suggestion that will help alleviate a lot of consumer ills.  Since youre giving a time range could you just use days instead of business days and expand the range?  It wouldnt be that hard.  It would just be  days for the standard turnaround or  days for the custom.  It would be nice if every company would do this but I guess lowering numbers and using the qualifier of business for the number of days makes something more psychologically salient and therefore more preferable.  In this case the original poster would have seen  days which covers most of the  business days and even being misinformed would have given an extra two days thinking that days means business days.  Another option would be to do what Scotty from Star Trek suggested to Geordi in The Next Generation episode Relics and just overall increase your time estimate.  That way when someone inevitably gets it early they think youre miracle workers and it gives the company more time if they absolutely need it.,MotoX,crak8hz,2,t5_2xebt

5140127,0,t3_3ldg4o,Lets be honest. For those of us using a X the two most important changes from X to XPE are the screen size and camera quality. Fisher who is a Moto X fan said that while he used X his personal phone of choice he used a second phone for his camera. So a thumbs up for the new  camera. But still is the processor that much faster on the XPE than it was under X? I agree with Fisher than while the hands off capabilities is the selling point of the Moto X the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired. And is the software that much better than before? Does it execute better? Difficult to say.Regardless of the questions  a thought provoking review by PocketNow.,MotoX,cv5kszg,0,t5_2xebt

5466635,0,t3_3pwpsr,I like Type Mail you can look at unified acounts and its very intuitive.  For texts I use google messenger and shuttle for music.  If you have issues getting used to the camera app google camera and  Zcamera are both good Z camera come with a very nice gallery app too.  If you dont like Moto display you can shut it off and use an app called gravity screen to unlock the phone with a wave and have it shut off on a table or in your pocket. For FB I use Tinfoil. No notifications but it doesnt invade the phone like the FB and messenger.  I also use Nova launcher which allows customizations like double tap to sleep and gestures to open frequent apps.  Theres just so much to choose from that you didnt have with IOS.  For Exchange mail I use mail.Edit to reiterate if you shut off moto display controls for more apps will show on the lockscreen and you can see texts and stuff. Double tap the entry to go straight to the app.  It will also show charging time on the lock screen.

6135705,0,t3_3zhuxk,Yeah that started happening to me as well on my Moto XPE. My Amazon Kindle App disappeared at least four times off my phone usually when I rebooted my phone. The Microsoft Excel app also did the same at least once. This did not happen with my phone until I moved to Marshmallow and seemed tied to me using an SD card. Not sure if what happened to me was an issue with Marshmallow or using an SD card I didnt use one when I was on Lollipop or maybe a combination of both. Any apps with issues were on the SD card. Aside from that Spotify kept logging me out and that one had been on external storage. My podcasting app Antennapod also on the SD suddenly dumped all my feeds and downloaded files. I was fed up with the issues so did a factory reset yesterday. I resolved to not do any manual moving and see if that avoids any issues relating to the SD card.

9156307,0,t3_55l73j,My quick opinion based on my experience. I bought the x last January and didnt love it. Some things were great particularly the camera but it really didnt do much for me. I decided to buy the X Pure about a week later and used both sidebyside for about two weeks. Ultimately the X Pure just blew the x out of the water for my needs particularly the screen amazing! and speakers. I listen to a lot of music and watch a lot of video on my phone the x just wasnt great in those areas.The only real complaint I have about my X today is that battery life is pretty weak. Its not a huge issue because I have a few Turbo Chargers and can top up pretty quickly but if there was one thing I could change about this phone right now itd be battery life. Regardless I still love this phone and plan to keep using it over the next year or so until I am compelled by something else. ,MotoX,d8cmmcd,1,t5_2xebt

9424333,0,t1_d9akomu,In my experience although Moto does it best there are some pretty reasonable substitutes.  Most flagships already have camera launch gestures for example.AC Display is a pretty good substitute for Moto Display.  Not perfect but really not bad at all.  Especially on an AMOLED screen.  Theres even a builtin wave to wake feature but it doesnt work for me YMMV.The Pixel and a few other phones support OK Google detection with the screen off.  Even though SD  processors are all supposed to support this most phone dont.  LG and Nexus have it baked into the Google App Pixel via Google Assistant Samsung has S Voice and Moto has Moto Voice.  But no other manufacturers do it.  I usually end up double tapping my current phone to wake it and then saying OK Google but I really do miss Moto Voice.To be honest though OK Google with the screen off is fantastic if you dont use a secure lockscreen but if youre going to have to unlock your screen to do anything anyway it becomes less important.  Im moving to a phone with a fingerprint scanner so Ill finally start to use a secure lockscreen.  I originally considered screenoff voice controls to be something I really wanted on a phone but then realized they arent a dealbreaker since Ill have to unlock it anyway.,MotoX,d9alkva,2,t5_2xebt

Ive recently started playing around with custom ROMS and the support seems great so far particularly over on xda. Both are likely to be supported for the same amount of time as they were launched at roughly the same time. I think the G has better waterproofing but Ive used my Play in the rain with no issues a few times. Id recommend the Play personally just for the added speed and size.

10472764,0,t1_dcuj7yi,Ok thanks. Hows your battery and performance with TruPure? It claims to be faster and more efficient than stock but so do most ROMs. If its basically just an optimized version of the stock ROM Ill definitely check it out.,MotoX,dcv7243,1,t5_2xebt

10549890,0,t3_5r1sgf,I always get a little nervous unlockingrootingflashing but I had too. The AICP ROM is incredible. Its flies battery life even with greenify isnt nothing to write home about IMO so far. If anyone is considering if its worth it it is. And if anyone is waiting its worth the wait as well.

10646872,0,t3_5sb5cz,I get around  hours screen on time. I think it may be because I dont have Facebook or Snapchat installed. Some apps just love to drain your battery in the background. On my really good days I can get  hours mostly redditing and youtubing. ,MotoX,dde55q1,1,t5_2xebt
10733799,0,t3_5tiwbx,If you can afford it the Pixel is incredible. I had a  Moto X before my pixel XL and I loved it. Didnt think I could love a phone more until I used a Pixel. Its just like a Moto X but with none of the downsides rd party vendor slow updates mediocre camera etc.,MotoX,ddn406i,5,t5_2xebt

10858839,0,t3_5v7dyy,You didnt recently implement adoptable storage did you? SC goes on the external SD if you do and apps on the SD are usually significantly slower.Ill use this thread to ask as well has anyone had trouble logging in recently while rooted? Ive never had a problem on AICP and obviously since its nougat I have no xposed no plugins no thirdparty anything. But I logged out today briefly and tried to log back in amp got the your login temporarily failed  message. Ive tried everything deleting amp reinstalling and it will NOT let me in.Have they updated their security recently? I mean the absolute refusal to support rdparty anything was bad enough but I could live with it. Now it seems if youre rooted tough shit period.EDIT found it was because the  nightly of AICP included Magisk preinstalled everyones been having problems. Thank god I thought that might be the case.

10863506,0,t1_ddzs1uz,But what will be the price ? I dont want to spend too much. The X play was above my budget but worth the expense though. But now my budget is lower and the G plus is in the budget  around   ,MotoX,de0hsgr,1,t5_2xebt

11162639,0,t1_detzpcl,Actually youre going to want to look for Quick Charge . chargers preferably ones that are Qualcommcertified they have a list on their website. I would highly advise against getting a QC . charger because there have been numerous compatibility issues reported with the Moto X Pure due to its use of a proprietary nonstandard charging scheme. For whatever reason though QC . chargers generally seem to work. However I would research and verify the other Moto X owners have consistently had success with whatever charger you are thinking of getting just to be sure because Ive seen certain chargers with multiple conflicting reports.ampnbspEDIT Actually let me rephrase Some QC . chargers may work so you can potentially get a QC . or QC . charger but just research and make absolutely sure that it works.,MotoX,dex9uix,1,t5_2xebt

11491531,0,t3_63zrc7,The fact that they are using that area to currently guide people towards a newer phone isnt some kind of automatic sign that the Moto X line is now the Moto Z. In other words no it doesnt mean anything really aside from that currently Motos marketing team considers the Moto Z Play to be companys closest current offering to the Moto X Pure Edition which was released about a year and a half ago  fairly old in phone years.,MotoX,dfykb5m,18,t5_2xebt
