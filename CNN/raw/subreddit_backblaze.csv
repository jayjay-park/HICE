8542561,0,t1_d69czbh,Yeah  it is misleading and in my opinion deliberately so. All they market is the cost per GB to store data  but then like you say  when anyone actually wants that data back theyre quite frankly ripped off.It doesnt matter if it costs .TB to store data  if it then costs a fortune to download it then it defeats the object. Theyve said that this is a service that youd use to build your own Dropbox like service  well thats a load of crap. The only use for these services with crazy bandwidth costs for the average user is archiving infrequently accessed data or backups that you plan to never restore unless in absolute emergency.If they cant make the cost model work then they should up the price of the storage  not hide the costs in the bandwidth.It like me offering fuel for . per litre but then charging litre for the transfer of the fuel down the nozzle at the petrol station.,backblaze,d69e15g,2,t5_2ttis
