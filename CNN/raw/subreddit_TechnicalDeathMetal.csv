4134680,0,t1_crrjpkq,the fuck are you talking about lol. im legit asking a question trying to have a discussion here you arent making any sense at all. what could i possibly be salty about? you are the one downvoting me for some reason. seems you are the salty one here....for some reason...which once again i have no idea.,TechnicalDeathMetal,crrkp0f,4,t5_2s8ge
5061137,0,t1_cuw1f33,Im just trying to understand your thought process. This subreddit isnt that well known so how you even managed to find this before you found rprogmetal rmetal rdjent or rdeathcore which are all much more relatable to your question than technicaldeathmetal I mean you mentioned Tool for fucks sake. Theyre not even metal theyre like heavier progressive rock at most. I dunno man youve managed to confuse me haha,TechnicalDeathMetal,cuw23yy,2,t5_2s8ge
5457693,0,t3_3ps0uo,I definitely recommend this album. Pretty straightforward death metal in my opinion nothing too insanely technical about it but it does have its own unique flavors to it. Very solid release. My CD and tshirt should be here this weekend!,TechnicalDeathMetal,cw99sxs,-1,t5_2s8ge

5560596,0,t3_3ra7ao,This was the highlight track for me mainly because of the bass solo. I felt the first half was really strong but felt the second half left a lot to be desired. I was also disappointed to find out Temple Aflame was  minutes of ambient noises with recorded voices. If it were an atmospheric black metal album Im all for that but it felt out of place here. ,TechnicalDeathMetal,cwmccq3,1,t5_2s8ge
