6471631,0,t3_446686,Well it depends on your fitness level I guess. For me it has shown increase in size for glamour muscles but thats because I was eating the right amount of calories. My chest got bigger my arms  which are kind of genetically enhanced to get bigger because they are the first to grow and shoulders too. I will say as you get heavier in x it will become increasingly hard for you to work out on those in between days. As the weight gets heavier the workout gets harder than it seems. I personally need those extra days off to recover for the next days heavy ass lifts. Unless you think you can handle it I wouldnt do it. You wont be able to reach your full potential on lifts with those extra days no matter what. If you wont those muscles you are gonna have to eat right. Now they may not be definite but you can get the mass then cut later with a different program.,SL5x5,czopngi,2,t5_3b34e

8661267,0,t3_4yf9qg,When I did my run of xSLs I ran on my offdays.  The first two weeks were brutal but then I found myself getting stronger on my runs and over all it helped me.  Not sure what I did to make a difference but I just powered through it. ,SL5x5,d6o9xl0,2,t5_3b34e
