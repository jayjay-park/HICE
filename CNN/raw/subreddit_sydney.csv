36256,0,t3_1uitqo,As a former car insurance claims handlerrecoveries officerall rounder I can provide the following information!The reason they ask you about existing damage is that the duty of the insurance company is to restore the car to the pre accident condition in the event of an accident.  If your car is carrying significant existing damage its impossible to restore it to a pre accident condition.Scuff marksminor scratches are usually ok.  Significant dents may need to be referred to an assessor prior to insurance.  Existing rust heavy panel damage or hail damage will usually likely need to be repaired prior to insurance being issued although hail will likely be accepted under TP fire amp theftIn your case Id suggest Third Party Fire amp Theft as your car is not worth a comprehensive policy.  A minor crack in the headlight and light scratchesscuff marks should be ok to tick the no option.,sydney,ceik5b0,1,t5_2qkob

Only reason I waited was because I was catching the train to central to get a connecting train so I had no reason to be there early if itd taken another  minutes to start printing tickets I wouldve had to jump the gate as well or risk missing the train and having to wait an hour for the next one.Well done Cityrail.,sydney,cf9aotr,1,t5_2qkob

If the Koi fish were to make it to the top of the Yellow River they would be transformed into an almighty Dragon. Similar to Pokemon. Magikarp a type of koi carp fish turns into Gyarados. Hence you see a lot of people with a tattoo of the Koi one arm and a Dragon on the other.Pretty cool aye?It has other meanings as well like money and luck flowing upstream towards you.

There might be maintenance trains rolling stock test runs or just regular carriages being shuffled between places. These would be timetabled internally but to an outsider without access to this information these trains would indeed be coming at random intervals. All this equipment would run you over and kill you just the same as a regular timetabled train.The OTSI website on Rail Safety has examples of this for the morbidly curious e.g. the fatality at Kogarah from a am passenger service.,sydney,chtoec0,2,t5_2qkob

The universities and colleges can only reasonably do an upgrade of their ID cards at the start of a new year so expect it around this time.There is the ability to setup a function where ifwhen a student stops taking classes the student ID Opal can be automatically changed from concession to adult cares.

No press release has been sent out  maybe political because they dont want to have too many announcements in the Eastern Suburbs?For others following along the following is the full list of STA buses for which Opal is legal if the bus is marked with Opal bus stickersgt                                          L LMX X X X X X XXgt   LMX X XThe first group is Waverley and Randwick routes the second apaprently adds on some Port Botany Routes,sydney,cieqjwf,1,t5_2qkob

1365001,0,t1_cine2re,gtTo get the most out of a lithiumion battery you should try to keep it north of  percent as much as possible. For the most part going from all the way full to all the way empty wont help in fact itll do a little damage if you do it too often. That said its smart to do one full discharge about once a month for calibration but dont do it all the time. Running the whole gamut on a regular basis wont make your battery explode or anything but it will shorten its lifespan.gtBut! You dont want to have it charging all the time either lithiumion batteries can get overheated. Luckily for you your charger is smart enough to help with this and will cut your phone off for a spell once its full. And to complicate matters a little further your battery doesnt particularly like being all the way full either. In fact your battery will behave the best if you take it off the charge before it hits  percent and leaving it plugged when its already full is going to cause a little degradation.gtSo if youre really particular about optimizing your batterys life you should try to go from around  percent to around  percent in one go and then back down whenever possible. A bunch of tiny charges isnt as bad as going from  down to zero all the time but its not optimal either.,sydney,cine4xa,5,t5_2qkob

This requires a lot more sophistication than just issuing cards preprogrammed for a concession fare.   And there are a lot of types of tertiary concession entitlements  unis TAFEs apprentices etc  its not a simple job.I have to agree that its pretty stupid they havent released pensionerseniors cards yet though.

Unless the former owner had a number of the same violations already the maximum fine would not have been imposed and totalling  in fines is an incredibly hard thing to do for a one off party even if all the maximum penalties were included.

People here claim to have invented the adage Ps make degrees since back in the day they allowed a Partial Credit Pass  is a pass grade for core subjects. It is a massive campus and there is alot of stuff going on. Which faculties will you be mingling with? The EFS or whatever the economics and commerce fac is called now is pretty weak in social events as far as I know.Most of the exchange students are North American and Asian living on campus or near campus but the great majority of students are from NSW. North American crowd that live in the village can get pretty rowdy. I live nearby and walk my dog through there.UTS Best location being in the heart of the city. On campus facilities are ok. Not so much of a party hub as Club Mac but overall the feeling I get from being at UTS is that they are much more social with each other.

I guarantee that your guess will be inaccurate. From the stairs you have an unimpeded view of about  or  seats. How exactly is one supposed to deduce the numbers of available seats upstairs based on a sample of  or  seats at one end of the train? Sure you could stand up after every stop and take a look but then a people like you will bitch and whinge about the weirdo who is pacing up and down the aisles b whos gonna go to that sort of effort when there is a perfectly good seat available on the stairs?Sitting on the stairs is not lazy and its minimally obstructive. And heres the thing there are two options either I stand horribly uncomfortable major loss and give you a marginally easier trek up the stairs minor gain or I sit major gain and you have to squeeze mm to the left as you exit minor loss. I think the utility adds up Im gonna sit on those stairs.Try not to step on my jacket as you have to bend mm that way gt,sydney,clzam9s,-1,t5_2qkob

Metro fabrics in Tempe is run by a guy who lacks any personal empathy whatsoever youll browse alone in the giant shed and then have to yell up the stairs for him to come out but the remnant bins are good for rummage if basic fabrics is what you want. He also specialises in lingerie items. The website is encouraging because it was written by his kids to entice customers. I like going there he stolidly ignored me for twenty minutes once while he vacuumed his office you just dont get quality grumpy service like that anymore! The Fabric Shop in surry hills when they have a sale is good. I like the little place on Cleveland Street  because nowhere else has Italian designer remnants.

2543109,0,t3_2orc5z,Just a reminder to everyone that you should be super truthful on your insurance policies. Pay the extra hundred dollars now and avoid having your claim rejected by providing misleading info. Most of the time this is unintentional and not much thought goes into it. But it seriously does matter and there is no way out of it later on. So please next time you do any sort of insurance policy sign up be truthful. For the sake of any future claim that could decide your fate financially or otherwise.Edit also I highly recommend getting at least  unit of income protection insurance from your super while you are healthy. Upgrade it when you can. The  unit will come in handy if you ever fall Ill and need support.,sydney,cmqis8w,3,t5_2qkob

Try googling directions from place to place at the time you would start work for an accurate commute time. If you are going to be driving to work you wont need a place too close to the train station these will attract higher rents from people who commute to the city. Loosely the farther away from the city center the cheaper of course. There are also a heap of brand new apartment buildings opening in Wentworth Point. A lot of the owners are Chinese investors getting a start in the Aus market and are open to haggling down a bit on price. Because they are new they paradoxically can attract a lower rent.

2800272,0,t1_cnmdlik,Thanks for the info yeah my boyfriend asked a few times about replacing the battery but he kept saying the battery is fine its the alternator. The car pretty much did the same as last time I needed to get it replaced a year ago... We jump started it but it just wouldnt last very long and the power steering wouldnt work. The guy that changed the battery last year said that the car runs pretty much everything off the battery e.g. power steering so its pretty hard to get the battery to recharge if it goes flat because it tries to use any energy the battery has for all of that and just runs out of juice again before it can be charged. Like I said Im clueless about this stuff but it sounds a bit weird having a  model car that has parts fucking up. Its only got about km on it. ,sydney,cnmdp82,1,t5_2qkob
2800307,0,t1_cnmdlik,This is the right advice. The alternator charges the battery but when you stick a new battery in it it is already charged and you will be able to drive it to the garage to be serviced alternator checked. Just look up your battery on the internet or take a photo of it on your phone and go over to repco across from the  petrol station in camperdown. New battery will be around  depending on type. They will help you choose one. Install it easy instructions for changing battery on internet. Youll need a spanner to get the bolts off amp on then head straight to the garage.Personally Ive never been ripped off by plain old Kmart auto in the bowels of Broadway. They try to upsell you like crazy but their work has always been fine for me  different cars over  years. I was picking up my car there one day and heard an employee tell someone who was enquiring about tyres to go somewhere else to get them as they only sold  types of tyres really shit shit and still pretty shit.

But for the minute its on the same route as the ParramattaOlympic Park services and doesnt require a detour to stop at. Bayview Park on the other hand was right up in Hen amp Chicken Bay and was a fiveminute detour off the river route and only ran during peak services anyway. Made sense to close that one off while KP is not a detour.I do agree though Rhodes would be a better spot. Mind you a new ferry wharf before you look at purchasing land is quite a few million bucks and I believe theyre also looking at building additional services in other areas that need it sooner. New areas from what Ive heard  these are rumours only include  Blackwattle BayWhite Bay especially when the redevelopment of those areas is underway Barangaroo theres even talk of moving the transit hub over that way from CQ in the medium term! Balmoral BeachSeaforth areas as these are a very short distance from the CBD but take forever via public transport!Now in regards to no people at KP  the wharf has roughly  people get on for different services in the AMPM peaks and many more on Sundays when the river service is backed up substantially.

I had cooked beef cheek in a slow cooker multiple times before but it never turned out as well as when I got a sous vide machine. Melting tender and the meat juice in the bag got thrown into the gravy for maximum heft of flavor and richness full of collagen and the good stuff that makes it gel. Same thing with beef and veal shank. I actually only use my round slow cooker these days for when I need a bain marie to whip egg whites and stuff like that.

Apparently using detergent to wash it is discouraged but that after every meal you just need to scrub it a bit in water then reoil?  It just doesnt seem hygenic to me! What about if you dont cook that often does the oiled pan go bad?I know people have been using cast iron for centuries without an issue but arent they the same people who cook a lot?

4012609,0,t1_crdnoxf,Thats a common misconception about how bank lending works. They dont borrow at variable to fund fixed at least not directly  where they do they will swap the variable exposure to a fixed one. They are going to offset your fixed rate loan with fixed rate money  either from a customer deposit ie a TD  around bps or a wholesale rate which is around bps atm.So they dont really miscalculate fixed rates at all because they arent trying to make them moreless expensive than variable.  Which is why its a bit funny when people talk about fixed rates and trying to beat the banks. The bank already locked in its bps and moved on they couldnt care less what happens to the variable rate.,sydney,crdo2lu,1,t5_2qkob

4282230,0,t1_cs89feh,Yep I agree.  But jsut to be sure you understand one thing  theres nothing wrong with debit card purchases as your primary vehicle.  You wont do better than the  fee when getting your cash in fact unless youre really savvy the cash exchange rate will be considerably worse than that   spread is more common.  So the cash should only be for emergencies or cashonly vendors again extremely rare in the US.  Use the debit card for most everything although do be aware of the issues with temporary holds as mentioned elsewhere.Note  if you want calculate exchange rate spread manually since this is almost never published directly  Take the buy and sell rates add them together and divide by .  The result is called the midmarket rate for the pedants thats not always the case but its close enough for this discussion.  Then take the buy rate the higher one and divide by the the midmarket rate the result from step .  You will get a number like ..  Subtract the  and multiply by  to get the percentage in this case ..  Compare this to the foreign transaction fees charged by your bank for debit card transactions where the actual exchange rate is processed by Visa to the midmarket rate.Edit clarify formula.P.S. While were on the topic of avoiding exchange rate scams NEVER NEVER NEVER allow a foreign merchant to charge your AUDdenominated card in AUD as a service to you or whatever other bullshit they might say.  You always want to be charged in the local currency of wherever you are.  This is the only way you access the midmarket exchange rate from the Visa network.  If you opt to be charged in your cards issuing currency AUD you are falling for a scam called Dynamic Currency Conversion where the bank and merchant collude to charge a usurious exchange rate on which they each keep a cut to line their pockets.  You may still pay the  foreign transaction fee too just as insult to injury.  Be warned.   Note that this scam is most common in hotels and large tourist shops  places that have lots of international visitors.  It probably wont happen at say a local supermarket.,sydney,cs8bram,2,t5_2qkob

4576206,0,t1_ct7feps,Go read through the rubrics. It wont take you very long.English at a HSC level is about the relation between context and concept and how thats expressed through language. You need to be able to explain why an author is expressing a concept in a particular manner which is often because of the context within which they are writing  so if youre comparing texts they express a similar idea but do it differently because they exist in different periods of time. I view it as a historian because thats what I did at uni. A text is a piece of evidence and it gains significance because it comes from a particular moment in time. So I need to develop an understanding of what the text is expressing and also of what the values attitudes and beliefs of the period of time from which it came were.,sydney,ct7fsh2,5,t5_2qkob

Youll probably find that real estate agents wont take you as a tenant for an apartment at that price anyway since most of them ask for some form of proof of income. Remember that the cost of living for everything in Sydney is a lot higher than Adelade so factor that into the price of things. A general rule of thumb is that your accommodation should be no more than about  of your income.As for the suburbs  the post you link to is for someone thats literally on the opposite side of Sydney and further out. Youd have terrible commute times. To get some idea of the commute time Use Google Maps Transit Directions to pop in various suburbs and the address of the company remembering to set it for arrival at am Monday.

4697149,0,t1_ctmld2n,If people had to buy their own driverless cars I would agree. The thing that changes this is that they dont need to buy their own for driverless cars to make sense. Driverless cars are perfect for a subscription based service where you summon a car on demand and then just get out and the car drives off to serve someone else.Given how much of the time the average car spends just parked somewhere around  is a figure that gets thrown around a lot the cost of hiring a driverless car on demand for all your trips could easily be less than the operating costs of owning a car rego insurance depreciation fuel etc. If that happens it will literally make sense to scrap your car and go driverless only. The lower the price per km for driverless falls the higher the annual mileage at which scrapping your car and using driverless only will make sense.The reason I think youd have to be mad to be building new car parks is you only need a small proportion of people to switch to start killing the market for parking. Unless UWS or WSU now is happy to build a car park that they are only going to need for a  years at most it is a crazy choice.

4847891,0,t3_3ha2js,Yep and sort off.I bounced around a lot and I think my final degree is actually in Advertising but I dabbled in Journalism and may have had my heart set on it coming out of high school... however I wound up working in PR and when I finally went to get a piece of paper UTS was the best so to UTS I went.The comms courses are good and as much as I rant that my degree is a useless piece of paper the reality is had I not worked and continued to work in the industry I would have found it invaluable  in the end I enjoyed doing it despite myself.Journalism is notoriously hard to get into and has an extremely high attrition rate. There will be like  something bright and fresh faced boys and girls in the  class with UAIsATARS? in the th percentile with a handful of mature aged students. The kids will drop like flies as most are wrote learners and worse is the harsh reality that there are no jobs and what few there are often require you to sell out any moral and professional ethics  unless you wind up at the ABC but theyre almost at the point of locking the applicants into a room and chanting TWO GRADS ENTER ONE GRAD LEAVES!The mature age students typically have worked in the industry in some capacity and have studied at Macleay or the like theyre the ones most likely to make it  at any rate last I checked on Linkedin theyre the ones with jobs.In terms of the uni itself... well if all you want to do is rock up for your lecture and tute then fuck off there isnt a better uni for it.

There are also plenty of higher end salons that use the better unnatural coloured dyes like Pravana. I would suggest you try out Stevie English or Comb Hair in Glebe or New Do or Head over Heels in Newtown.

I think in general people would largely be quite supportive of having specialised areas suited for different purposes whether they be commercial industrial residential or entertainment. Ultimately a large part of the divisions we see now come about due to restrictive zoning laws which ideally would be greatly relaxed but I dont think the idea of CBDs is no longer compatible with modern Sydney.Ideally there would be upwards of  or  CBDs around Sydney perhaps with generous tax reductions given to those businesses and firms that chose to relocate from the main CBD to other areas cutting down the strain on roads and public transport to have so many people moving from all over the city to the CBD each day. ,sydney,cxmiqpg,2,t5_2qkob
5850768,0,t1_cxlluat,gt In many developed coutries the standard to connect big cities is trains at about kmph. Look at the KTX in Korea Shinkansen in Japan TGV in France etc... kmph is only slightly better than the car. At that speed of course the train cannot compete. So then you agree with my comment that its not worth electrifying the existing lines when the speeds cant be noticeably increased right?   That was my main point  the lack of electric lines is not the limiting factor right now as the trains average much slower than their top speed of  kmhr already.  Electrifying the lines would only allow you to run a different type of slow train like the existing electric lines to the Blue Mountains Central CoastNewcastle or South Coast.There are some other justifications for electrifying the existing lines that could be brought up that the article didnt really go into the ability to access green power in the future if we ever signifciantly change electricity generation from coal the shifting of pollution from local sources diesel rail cars to centralised sources coal power plants where it perhaps can be better controlled reduction of emissionsair quality problems in tunnels and at stations reduced maintenance and consolidation of fleet by standardizing on a single electric train type faster acceleration of electric trains versus diesel trains this only a very minor point in the regional areas with few station stops but its more important in urban areas.The problem is all of the above points while favourable to electric trains simply cannot be justified by the huge cost of installing the poles and wires  the fact that electricity may actually be more expensive than diesel to operate with NSWs high electricity costs the costs of purchasing new electric rolling stock  the increased maintenance costs along the right of way and  fundamentally very little improvement in travel time and thus economic benefit.

Most screen protectors are hokum  snake oil  junk sold to people who think their screens are still from  years ago when the plastic would scratch at the slightest provocation. Grab a key and try to mar any part of your modern smartphones screen. Even a light drop of keys or other sharp objects will do nothing. Gorilla Glass and similar ion reinforced glass is resistant to this kind of stuff. Its still brittle for edge damage and thats why having a case is a good idea especially one where it extends past the front edge of the screen to give a little extra cover to the face.Putting on a screen protector for superficial scars is likely to make it worse for two reasons chances are the screen protector is softer otherwise it wouldnt be that cheap or easy to apply and so more likely to scratch and because it puts another layer on top of the screen and makes your touch amp viewing experience worse.tldr dont bother fighting the battle for a product that does little for your phone.,sydney,cy0l1t1,1,t5_2qkob

Beyond the ANEF  threshold noise levels are getting to a point where residential development really isnt ideal. Basically the government doesnt want to get into a situation where they end up having to pay for soundproofing andor buying out the worst affected sites like they had to do around Kingsford Smith. I think the article is jumping the gun a bit as AS has been under review ever since changes to the current noise measurement systems were mooted in early .

From there the psych evaluated me popped me on some meds and suggested a psychologist in the same building for therapy sessions. I had about  med changes till I found one that worked well for me and the therapist helped me a lot. They even had me speak to their GP for blood tests to check my diet sleep remedies etc. So theyre very thorough.I know antidepressants can make you feel absolutely terrible initially but youve gotta stick with it. Eventually your body will get used it varies but took about a week for me. Dont go off of them suddenly either.

Most people work because they have to because they need money to live not because they chose to or love it. Even those of us who are lucky to pursue a career we love have endless mindnumbing tasks in our jobs. Youll still have deadlines at work youll still have hard slog at work youll still have stress at work youll still have difficult personalities and jerks at work youll still struggle for motivation at work. Difference is at high school they give you lots of chances and try to help guide you at many workplaces youll just get fired. Try to stick with high school. An HSC opens a lot of doors not only for the year after but for so many years to come. Unless youre going directly into a trade apprenticeship stay with high school...

7486620,0,t3_4htz0u,As a publican my opinion will be obviously biased. I think that there were issues that had to be dealt with but I do not think a blanket style approach is the right answer. I think the  am closing times are fine for pubs but I am opposed to the . am lockouts. It just does not make sense for me to be able to trade and still have to turn people away at the door when they are clearly not intoxicated. I think that since we are apparently a  hour city it is unfair to shift workers who are not able to have a drink after work. Their body clocks do not register it as being nighty night time so I think that there should be something available to them but I do not have a solution other than letting some pubs stay open who  have a good track record  will accept tough guild lines like a minimum amount of security not run stupid binge drinking promotions and only let shift workers in.At the end of the day there was a problem with a small proportion of the community and punishing everyone to solve the problem is like making everyone in the classroom do  lines because little Jimmy keeps talking in class. Why cant jimmy just be expelled or punished?There are venues that I think are run with the aim to get people as pissed as they can but it is these venue operators that need to be bought into line not all of us. I have had one incident in seven years and it was a patron from another hotel who had been turfed out who decided it would be a good idea to punch one of my customers as they left the venue but regardless of my clean sheet my good business model and great offering I am forced to close earlier than I would like.It all comes down to the government deciding it is easier and cheaper to put restrictions on our lifestyles than increasing police levels and really punishing the offenders and the rough pubs. It might be easy to say that you dont care that the government is controlling you on this issue because you see that it might solve a problem which it hasnt just so you know but what do they start trying to control next?,sydney,d2t6s75,7,t5_2qkob

Receipts are to be provided  to the office. this is for a lease with no petsSo my problem is  I want clean carpets and  I dont want to pay for a professional clean twice during the tenancy.And the agent is really not being honestcooperative.

7601021,0,t1_d366qo1,Firstly understand that depression is a lot more common amongst people than you realise. So remember you arent alone and there are various sources for help. If you need help Google is your answer. If not see a therapist.There is no clear cut solution for depression. A lot of people live with it but what you can do is work on yourself. Once upon a time all I did was go to school study sleep eat repeat. Thats it. It never occurred to me that my lack of a social life deterred my happiness. By trying new things things I have never done before and things which scared me really broadened my perspective. Whether its a part time job or a new hobby or sport or making new friends or something youve always wanted to do but just never have DO IT! Months after trying new things I actually forgot about my depression. Which is why a lot of elderly people say having a routine is very important.Disclaimer Im no expert and Im not qualified for giving psychiatric advice but this is simply my opinion in my experiences. Hope that helps mate.,sydney,d3674d1,7,t5_2qkob

Thats both good and bad.  On the one hand they probably require no or only nominal notice to evict the month period youre thinking of for tenancies is for nocause terminations there are other grounds that require less notice but on the other hand you have to get your eviction orders from the Supreme Court rather than NCAT so it costs a bit more.Obviously nobody go buying this property based on my semiinformed postings as I could be wrong.,sydney,d42y9kd,2,t5_2qkob

8408799,0,t1_d5smhic,gt theres the little fact that donating to a church is a tax deduction and PR move.In Australia donations to churches tithes and offerings are not tax deductible. In the US they are.gt How much money do you think Sanitarium makes? Thats one of their businesses.According to Wikipedias entry on them they had a net surplus of m of their m revenue after expenses and donations. Which can only be used for their nonprofit ends. Note that if they pay it to their staff as wages the staff pay tax on it.gtWallets open when people think they can buy their way into heaven.I dont know of every church but Christians generally believe that you cant save yourself through your own actions. And that God saves you by grace once you believe. Ephesians  paraphrasedgtWalk into any church modest or grand and know that the organisation that owns it ultimately didnt pay a cent for it barely pays to keep it and can sell it at any time for a giant profit if you give me something worth  and I immediately sell it for any value then Ive made a profit for doing effectively nothingEither you count donations as money the organisation earns or you dont you cant have it both ways. The people donate to the organisation in good faith knowing believing that its going to be used for whatever purpose. Sporting clubs also work in this kind of way.gtYou dont appear to have been exposed to what goes on in businesses larger than your own. Good financial controllers are some of the most suss people on the planet.I know how its possible to evade tax completely. I dont do it because . Its immoral. . Its expensive shell companies in tax havens think Facebook Ireland Apple Ireland etc.gtChurches start right out of the gate paying zero tax so even if they did nothing at all theyre  more profitable than private enterprises of equivalent size. Then as mentioned above they can carry out all the financial activities of private business provided they allocate their profits appropriately and this can be as simple as writing a budget document for next years activities.Correct.gtAll of that is before they start exercising shady options. The legal avenues available to big business to dodge tax are significant.Havent seen any churches funnel money offshore unless you count Mission work in Africa and whatnot. gtif everyone does it including many individuals then what does that tell you?Tax Evasion is not as rampant as you believe. Most of it is because transnationals can shift tax. Tax Reduction through stupid loopholes is alot more common but only saves a few  off the total tax bill which still comes up to several million for some businesses.We are talking about businesses here though.gt Consider the wealth of that dinky little cult called scientology. Theyve a tiny number of members and theyre rich as fuck.I watched the Going Clear doco and am looking forward to the Louis Theroux doco on them and it seemed to me that they targeted and go after the wealthy. Selling them course after course ranging from  to  to achieve the Clear status.Its best described like this imagine joining the Catholic Church but not being told about the crucifixion and the resurrection until you have reached Operating Theological Level III which can only be attained after many years and tens of thousands of dollars in churchrun coursesAt the end of the day if you approach it like a cynic Churches exist to make money and make money only. Then thats all you see. But all churches temples and mosques exist to convert and reach more people. Be they Islamic Catholic Christian or Buddhist.

If you cause damage to someone else and pay them compensation for the damage .. they are quite entitled to treat the compensation as they wish.For example they may simply keep the damage as is and then just use the compensation to offset the reduced value when they sell the vehicle in a year or so.  Its a perfectly reasonable thing for them to do.  The important thing is that theyve accepted the money as compensation for the damage youve done.  The guilty party doesnt get to also insist how the damaged driver spends the money  even though it does determine the amount of money owed .... MacIn an obvious example  if the car is written off you owe them the amount the car is worth.  You dont get to insist that they spend it on on a similar vehicle.  They are entitled to spend half of it to get rid of their credit card debt and buy a cheaper car with the other half.

8561469,0,t3_4wvz6i,Ok heres random ideas off the top of my head.In cbd picnic in the royal botanic gardens. shangrila buffet dinner in the hotel w. a cocktail in blu bar view of harbour at night is nice o bar has a nice rotating restaurant in Australia Sq. Very expensive but good for sharing a bottle of wine and enjoying the view  check out the new precinct down past king st wharf in barrangaroo. Its all new and a little trendy! theres two nice restaurants next to Argyle but keep an eye on costs as theres some pricey items. Theyre the cut and sake. I like both. Very different styles. You can grab a drink after if you want to or just wander around the quay. theres a funky bar at the back of the Sydney Theatre Company on the wharf. Not really much good for food I dont think tho. theres a rooftop bar near qvb called the rook. Inexpensive and pretty funky. Theyre known for their crab rolls but they serve other yummy food and drinks. Can get busy.If you want something with more character you could check out whats around surry hills tooThose are mostly food ideas. For activities those old sydney ship cruises where they give u a bbq on board. Kinda crowded but still fun movie at the cinema near the opera house actually go see a show or something at the casino opera house capital theatre sydney theatre co. go on a rocks guided tour  museums are fun. My fav. is the Australian Museum and the Art Gallery of NSW. I dont like modern art much. go and check out the Barangaroo park. Not much shelter but you could bring scooters or something and have some fun meandering around get a ferry to the north side have a coffee and get one back  visit the acquarium and see penguins and stuff Thats it. I lived in the city for years and now it just reminds me of work! I would recommend a National Park instead for myself. Like the Blue Mountains or Royal National Park. But I am on the top floor of a high rise so I see the whole city everyday right out to the outskirts and now completely take it for granted. ,sydney,d6brel0,3,t5_2qkob

9758565,0,t1_dafv9q8,I think I explained that the problem is that she is surrounded by people without my pragmatism.Theres a reason the aphorism The road to hell is paved with good intentions exists. Talk is cheap. It wont put food on the table clothes on the baby or return the  year delay from career that my niece is going to get.Have you ever been poor? Did you grow up without and always aware of the risk of going under? As a person that grew up with significant financial stress I can tell you that has a cost. Even when I was earning serious money I could barely spend it. Even today after decades of conscious effort to deprogram myself I still agonise over minor purchases buy the cheapest go without. Always because in the back of my mind I understand that every dollar I dont spend might be a dollar that keeps me off the street for another week. That kind of fear never goes away. I was hoping that her child wouldnt have to have that experience.The simple fact of compounding interest like the kind in your super is that the earlier you start the greater the gains.  years of not contributing to your super is a big deal at any time but the worst time you can do it is at the front. The additional discretionary investments that you should make to ensure against financial disaster will also be severely impacted. As stated before  years less vocational experience will reduce earning potential even further by acting as a negative force multiplier on both those essential investments. No amount of everything is fine attitude will change those financial realities.There are logical outcomes to having a child that are bad enough for committed couples with solid incomes and full preparation. Teenagers doing so without any preparation increases the risks for negative outcomes exponentially. If everything is going to be fine then why do the objective outcome statistics not support that? Fun fact pregnancy in a woman  years or younger is automatically reported to DOCS. Why do you think that policy exists?You want things to turn out right? Then you get off your arse and you make it so. Thats what I do whilst everyone stands around talking shit and as in your case criticising my attitude and doing nothing to help. Ive already got plenty of unhelpful people in my life your uninvolved moralising is entirely redundant here. I dont give a shit about whether you or the Pollyanna members of my family like me or not Im going to ensure the welfare of my niece and her child. Peoples feelings can take a fucking back seat to that.,sydney,dafymoh,3,t5_2qkob

9781549,1,t3_5f8wvr,Analysis of that mapEastern Sydney doesnt have much density and could increase its density. So the NSW Liberals should reconsider their plain of putting almost every new home in Parramatta and build in Eastern Sydney. Remember that Turnbull is from that area as many other rich people and they probably want to keep it an exclusive area where only the rich live. So I think that instead Sydney should be developed in a balanced way building everywhere and allowing poor people to live everywhere which means building public housing everywhere and not only in Parramatta as the NSW Liberals propose. ...

10042414,0,t1_dbgj8by,As someone who lives west of Parramatta I dont mind creating housing for people.  What I do mind is creating lots of low density housing for millions of people out west without any thought to infrastructure to support these people.  That and the shear amount of freight terminals that have been built within a couple of kilometers of me without a single upgrade of the roads around the area.  My local onramp to the M has become a choke point in the mornings.At the moment the solution to the housing issue seems to be slap another suburb out west.  Theres no flats or high density housing being built but everyone who gets a block of land out this way instantly builds a granny flat or townhouses on it.Add to the fact that the airport is being built with no train line just many more cars and trucks on the road. ,sydney,dbgjwlc,16,t5_2qkob

I fell in love with the place and went back quite a few more times. Qubec City was nice enough but much more traditional. I liked the busyness of Montral and actually found the people there really friendly the opposite of what many Canadians say.

Ive never seen one of the older apartments on Hill Street near the station for sale for example and Ive lived in the area for decades.That said that part of the North Shore RosevilleLindfieldKillara is going through a rapid phase of development and demographic change. Quite a lot of  year old fullbrick California bungalow style houses are being torn down in favour of the glass and gyprock McMansions that are in vogue at the moment.Lindfield in particular seems to be getting built up massively with plenty of apartments and townhouses either under construction or having been approved in the area around the school and post office.

Give strata a call alerting them of the situation. No matter what they say it IS their problem.Still there after  hours  call strata again. give it a paint job or a lowkey keying.

Its fucked because some of the cars in there have DEFINITELY been in the visitors spots for more than a few days. I have now resorted to parking only in visitors spots when theyre available so as to make my spot available for my friends when they come over. Am I a dick?

10559504,0,t3_5r6m49,Im in much the same basked you are.A bit over  months ago I split with my wife of  years. A few people here will say dont hit rock bottom and whilst I agree with that you do need time to mourn. It took me three months of almost constant drinking and binge watching some of the best TV Ive ever watched.My ex rejected my offer which was incredibly generous given we had no children and she hasnt had a full time income since weve been together. Most of the years of marriage she earnt nothing and was at tafe. Having sought legal advice Ive been advised I was a fool to offer her what I did just to take it and walk away. As it turns out going through court shell be lucky to get  of what I offered. Court is shitty and painful and the lawyers will sting you hard for money. Your ex will likely do things just to spite you. I dont know your side of the story nor hers but make sure you take the time to mourn properly. Work hard and earn the money required to settle this. Make sure your financials are in order and no matter what happens dont fall for any bait she may set for you to loose your temper itll only bite you in the ass later on. Keep in touch with your mates theyll help you get through it. Dont be bitter towards her either the resentment can grow and make you a grumpy person to be around.If you need to chat im happy to. Its a seriously painful process.,sydney,dd51f1e,7,t5_2qkob

The GP then points you in the right direction alongside a mental healthcare plan. Perhaps a close friend  family would tell the person they need a specific therapy but it would still start at the GP I would imagine. Edit There is no way I would ever go to a counsillor when Psychologists are regulated with proven education. I dont want to waste my time and money and want the best possible treatment I can find  particularly when Psychologists are so easily accessible through Mental Healthcare Plans. It sucks that you personally need to go through more study but thats what I personally expect when Im looking for treatment this goes for any sort of treatment of course. ,sydney,ddsrpuj,3,t5_2qkob

From there if no agreement then off to Tribunal. Its worth it. Just follow the process of timelines and such. You want to see final exit report. Was someone given a chance to be present for that? You want to see property inspection reports from throughout tenancy. You want original condition report. Take into account length of time in property number or tenants and original age of everything. Do you have pictures? Get all paperwork lined up. You should get a few of your own quotes on the work done too. Basically you are arguing two strands are some of the issues fair wear and tear? If so you shouldnt pay. OR if they are fixing stuff you broke or ignored then are quotes reasonable. And is the stuff they are charging you related to your tenancy or not? I have been to Tribunal once before and it is a simple and fair thing  kinda like going to the principals office where they get a bit annoyed at both of you for not being able to work it out then they look at all evidence and paperwork and huff and puff and make a decision on balance of probabilities. ,sydney,dfwacrc,4,t5_2qkob

11635659,0,t3_661rkl,Someone crying in the train or in public anywhere can be a tricky situation. How to act depends on how much you canwant to offer to help and how much that person actually wants people to help. Some people will stop and ask someone crying if theyre ok when they had nothing to offer apart from that are you ok and run off when the person crying needs some proper help. Sometimes the person helping wants to help a lot and will not take no for an answer or will insist on offering much more help than needed. Some will get a bit physical hugging and such without making sure the crying person is ok with it. So if youre going to reach out to someone crying you should make sure that you have some time to do so or a good way to hand them over to someone police for example who could help them better and you should be very aware of their body language and what they are saying. Offering tissues to the person crying on the train is a great move. Tells them that youre around to help and leaves it up to them and if they need more than you can offer then you can back up easily because you were just giving tissues. For someone facing domestic violence if you dont have the resources to hand the best thing to do is to encourage them to call a dv hotline. The hotline will know of resources and its a googleable number. You could also encourage them to the police but such a thing can be scary for a victim. ,sydney,dgewxxg,85,t5_2qkob

11676415,0,t1_dgjgusm,You are right once complete the Sydney Metro wont ever be able to run regular doubledecker trains  but that doesnt mean the system cant be operated by the government in the future. Theres no reason why we cant have two separate divisions of Sydney Trains one for the standard commuter network and one for the metro.Regardless I dont think it would be desirable to run doubledecker trains on the metro particularly the Epping to Bankstown section. It has been designed as a metro so trains can run fast and at high frequencies. Youll find that journeys between Chatswood or Bankstown and Central will be far quicker with the new system faster boarding and better accelerationbraking even if passengers do have to stand.In addition the government wants the new metro system to be more resilient and not impacted by delays on the rest of the network. At the moment if there is a signal fault at Redfern the whole network basically stops  that is an awful design flaw. If you look at other railways around the world they try to separate lines so that delays dont cascade across lines  and hopefully Sydney Metro will do the same.,sydney,dgjjdq5,2,t5_2qkob

Force people to change at these suburban stations where there is much more space. ,sydney,dgpt7b4,1,t5_2qkob

11747851,0,t3_67msck,Yep... Ive been pretty much a shutin for a couple of years now... and Im not exaggerating that at all.I work from home and very very rarely go out socially. The only thing that gets me out of the house is having to shop which I mostly do online anyway and whenever I have to pick up my kids when theyre coming to stay with me a couple of nights each week and one night a week during university semester when I have to go in and lecture for three hours thats normally a Monday but sometimes its on Tuesday.So... I spend a lot of time watching TV shows on YouTube or downloading whole series to watch backtoback lots of movies lots of time here on Reddit which actually forms part of my job because its a good place to figure out which stories I need to cover for work  I write  news analysis pieces for a Londonbased news outlet essentially doing their night shift during the afternoon here.I do travel down the coast to my folks place every  months for a week or so... but when Im there we mainly only see each other at dinner time and Ill follow the same routine as I do when Im home.I used to play my PS but it broke about  months ago and I cant be bothered buying anything to replace it. I dont really miss it all that much.Having said all that my lady friend who comes over from time to time to hang out has bought me a ticket to go and see the Swans play at the SCG in the Members Stand which I am really looking forward to.I havent been to a footy match in about three years ,sydney,dgrnckk,4,t5_2qkob
