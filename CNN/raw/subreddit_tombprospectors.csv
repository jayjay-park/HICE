9865373,0,t3_5gmyuu,Taken from the sheets dwhikg FRC Pthumeru Ihyll  theres Rom the Vacuous Spider as boss on L rare and very difficult boss in depth  FRC and most importantly roaming Watchdog! If you havent seen this rare occurrence with your own eyes yet I definitely recommend to descend to the deepest layer of this dungeon. Its a glorious sight.,tombprospectors,dathbgx,7,t5_3fokg

10279621,0,t3_5n7hkx,The dungeons IMO should be used to create your game build.  Go through the dungeons naturally and you will find certain gem types of shape and attributes that cater to different stat. builds per dungeon.That being saidPthumerianradialHintertomb triangle Loranwaning  moon shapeIsztriangle  much higher grade but more elemental basedCircle gems are for guns and are not specific to any dungeon.Radial gems fit in any gem slot and have a chance to drop for any other gem but are very rare.This is a very general guide.  You can look up more thorough posts on rbloodborne for the best chalice path and how to.  My advice is make a straight shot for Loran as its depth  and you will level up like crazy.,tombprospectors,dc9923d,2,t5_3fokg
