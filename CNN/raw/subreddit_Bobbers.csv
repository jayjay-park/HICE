845599,0,t1_ch0ce54,Lurker here this is the exact correct sub for your question. I have a duel carb sync tool you can have for cost of shipping if you like. I only have one and youre the first person to mention needing one so its yours if you like. It has gauges instead of using oil. Once the carbs are synced it should run fine as long as you used the right jets. One question do you know the new and old jet sizes youre using?,Bobbers,ch0ecxg,2,t5_2sxtt

2257762,0,t3_2l0mhv,I have had a couple Bell Custom s. Fit and finish is great on them. My favorite one protected my head when it bounced off the concrete this year. Some other options not mentioned yet are the Daytona  and the Fulmer V but Ive never tried them.EditSpelling,Bobbers,clqs3xp,4,t5_2sxtt

3088631,0,t3_2vgyfe,I would get a rear fender I know it looks rad but you fuck yourself up if you get sucked into that void not as bad since it isnt hard tailed and chance of hitting a bump and you sliding into the wheel and frame arent as high but still.I also think it would look slightly better without a front fender but instead a back fender with a small sissy.Edit Meant to say you have a spring course its hard tailed.,Bobbers,coi4v4o,2,t5_2sxtt
3199793,0,t1_coti45o,Sorry youre not getting much of a response. Many people seem to like blue collar bobbers for your kind of bike. They have a pretty good model by offering tailored packages for Japanese bikes.,Bobbers,cotnpbm,1,t5_2sxtt

3508556,0,t3_30elh9,Came here to say that like you I have recently fallen in love with the forty eights.  Ive ridden for a while and cant afford a full size harkey and honestly I like the look of the forty rights more than any other.  But your post is making me consider going with my older idea of buying something similar to what you did and doing my own thing.  Thanks and really really awesome job!,Bobbers,cps77xn,1,t5_2sxtt

6239475,0,t1_cyyuvp7,Ahaha not at all! Its good!Hardtail  No rear suspension. Provides a neater more stripped down look but on a long ride youll soon realise why bikes come with rear shocks.Chuck around a corner  Im Aussie by the way so maybe a few of the words I useway I use them arent what youre used to but this means to basically go fast around a corner with confidence and ease.,Bobbers,cyyv04t,2,t5_2sxtt
6697905,0,t1_d0bh0ml,Thats a carb hanging off the side. And it looks to not be a rubbermounted engine. So no not a .Its just a pre Evo sporty with lots of work. Cant even tell if its a  or  or .,Bobbers,d0c4dke,1,t5_2sxtt

7486962,0,t3_4hw3j5,Love the design taillight location fit and finish. Personally the colors and textures dont work for me that is highly personal though. My taste would have been towards a more simple greyblack combo on those two sections. Looks like you do really nice work. ,Bobbers,d2t86pf,2,t5_2sxtt

8902438,0,t1_d6l5jwx,Hey just wanna say I have a xs as well and if you fully Bob it out it will suck on the freeway. Stock it spins way too much for the style of motor rpm mph and on a motor where the pistons travel together and the motor has no counterbalancers and its hard mounted to the frame? Literal pain in the ass. It will do freeway especially with a lighter guy but only with a nice cushy seat. ,Bobbers,d7hy119,1,t5_2sxtt

11447702,0,t1_dfszgt9,gt Naturally aspirated gasoline engine like the shadowIts not because its an NA gas engine its because the carbs are tuned to provide the correct mixture with a certain back pressure. What happens when you remove the back pressure from the exhaust side you free up the breathing of the engine to the point where at certain RPMs too much air is drawn through scavenged and it leans out the fuel air ratio because the carb only allows for a certain amount of fuel to be added. EFI systems can make up for very small changes like going to a higher elevation or slightly opening up the exhaust before computer modifications are needed.As to the horsepower increase its mostly a seat of the pantsnoise factor. With everything tuned precisely for newly freer flowing engine a bit can be gained but it will move farther up the RPM band.,Bobbers,dftl5be,2,t5_2sxtt
