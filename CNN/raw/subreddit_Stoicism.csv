587834,0,t3_20q4lr,. Focusing on virtue instead of happiness helped me achieve a more elevated state of mind. It helps me grow as a person and attain to a more durable happiness as a byproduct. Moreover I dont get jealous of other peoples happiness rather I get inspired by others virtues.. My attitude towards hardships changed. When confronted with a difficulty I inwardly declare I accept the challenge. Its a very empowering attitude.. Being mindful of what I can and cannot control helps me keep my presence of mind under stressful situations. It makes me more resilient. When unfortunate surprises occur I can quickly recollect my mind and focus it on a productive end.. It helps me dealing with procrastination. When I see my inner resistance as something beyond my control as impulses from my lizard brain and when I realize that whether I do whatever is necessary or not despite the inner resistance is within my control that my neocortex can ignore my lizard brain I attain to a useful perspective. So I can exercise my rational will and act despite the procrastinatory impulses.. Many people criticize Stoicism saying that a nonattached attitude impairs relationships especially the intimate ones.

915158,0,t3_24lhc3,Some of these I found flipping through some of my books are in the context of your own death rather than the death of someone else but I still feel as though they hold weight in reading and that I ought to include them. Anyway here goesgtFor it isnt death or pain that is frightening but the fear that we feel in the face of death or pain. That is why we praise the man who said To die is not dreadful but to die with dishonour.gtIt is towards death then that our confidence should be directed and towards the fear of death our caution whereas in fact we do the opposite taking flight in the face of death while showing carelessness neglect and indifference in forming a judgement about it. Socrates rightly referred to such fears as bogeys. For just as masks seem horrible and frightening to children because of their lack of experience we allow ourselves to be affected like that too by events for just the same reason as children are frightened by bogeys and in the same fashion. For what is a child? Ignorance. What is a child? Lack of knowledge. For in those areas in which he does have some knowledge he is in no way inferior to us. What is death? A bogey. Turn it round and youll find out look it doesnt bite! Sooner or later your poor body must be separated from its scrap of vital spirit just as it was formerly. Why be upset then if it should come about now? If it is not separated now it assuredly will be. For what reason? So that the cycle of the universe may be accomplished for it has need of what is presently in existence and what will come to be and what has completed its course.Epictetus Discourses ... To die . . . dishonour a verse from tragedy of unknown authorship Nauck frag. adesp. .. bogeys a reference to Plato Phaedo e. gtSo come on then now that you recognize these things and consider the faculties that you possess and after having done so say Bring on me now Zeus whatever trouble you may wish since I have the equipment that you granted to me and such resources as will enable me to distinguish myself through whatever may happen. No but you sit there trembling at the thought that certain things may come about and then you cast blame on the gods. For what else than impiety can result from such meanness of spirit? And yet God has not only granted us these faculties that enable us to endure whatever may happen without being debased or crushed by it but has also granted them to usas befits a good king and in truth fatherfree from all hindrance compulsion and restraint placing them entirely within our own power without reserving any power even for himself to hinder or restrain them. Possessing these faculties as you do free and as your own you fail to make use of them however and fail to perceive what it is that you have received and from whom but sit there grieving and groaning some of you blinded towards the giver and not even recognizing your benefactor while others are led astray by their meanness of spirit into making reproaches and complaints against God. And yet I can show you that you have the resources and equipment that are needed to be nobleminded and courageous while it is for you to show me what occasion you have for complaint and reproach!Epictetus Discourses ... Bring on me . . . may happen the human capacity to endure misfortune is presented as one of the distinctively human capacities provided by a divinely shaped universe .gtIt isnt the things themselves that disturb people but the judgements that they form about them. Death for instance is nothing terrible or else it would have seemed so to Socrates too no it is in the judgement that death is terrible that the terror lies. So accordingly whenever were impeded disturbed or distressed we should never blame anyone else but only ourselves that is to say our judgements. It is the act of an illeducated person to cast blame on others when things are going badly for him one who has take the first step towards becoming properly educated casts blame on himself while one who is fully educated casts blame neither on another nor on himself.Epictetus Enchiridion gtKeep in mind how fast things pass by and are gonethose that are now and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river the what is in constant flux the why has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable not even whats right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before usa chasm whose depths we cannot see.gtSo it would take an idiot to feel selfimportance or distress. OR any indignation either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.Marcus Aurelius Meditations .Also check out Senecas letter Of Consolation to Polybius.gtThis Consolatio addresses Polybius Emperor Claudius Literary Secretary to consol him on the death of his brother. The essay contains Senecas Stoic philosophy with particular attention to the inescapable reality of death.

From what Ive read the dosages were probably too low to be of much interest recreationally. If I recall correctly it was part of a probably misguided complex treatment for some physical problem not intended to affect the mind at all.Theres a section on this in Hadots Inner Citadel in which he is fairly dismissive of the idea that it significantly affected his writing. Specifically Hadot claims that arguments that opium addiction is required to account for the tone of the Meditations completely ignore their context in Stoic education and practice.I cant remember if the Hadot is where I read the descriptions of the dosage information or not. editIt is mentioned in the Inner Citadel but I dont think this is where I first saw it.edit See here for some of Hadots text in this section.,Stoicism,chzqpmr,4,t5_2r4kq

1744175,0,t1_cjyya9a,Explain my thinking nails it. Stoicism is technical jargon in a sense and no need to bring it up. But you need to go deeper. Your brother in law was surprised by your reaction. He was surprised about the person dying young and  he might be surprised when he discovers who the killer was in his latest crime tv show. People expects a certain outcome and when it does not follow the expected path their brains have trouble keeping up with that.You are more focused on reality and what is in front of you. At least I am. So when your brother in law says he was surprised by someone dying so young you understand that a whole bunch of people will agree with him. Young people dying breaks the expected outcome and its difficult for people to process this. That is why instead of saying no its not you start by saying I understand where you are coming from and then you can follow up with basically all you said. It is less aggressive in a way. I think its key to take into account not only the specific incident but also how a lot of people tend to react to it.,Stoicism,cjz0jha,3,t5_2r4kq

1802623,0,t3_2f6bzt,Its strange I was reading Seneca yesterday and came across this passagegt The mind should not be kept continuously at the same pitch of concentration but given amusing diversions. Socrates did not blush to play with small children Cato soothed his mind with wine when it was tired from the cares of state and Scipio used to disport that triumphal and military form in the dance not shuffling about delicately in the present style when even in walking men mince and wriggle with more than effeminate voluptuousness but in the oldfashioned manly style in which men danced at times of games and festivals without loss of dignity even if their enemies were watching them.The thought of Seneca comparing newfangled effeminate dancing with old fashioned manly dancing that you could do even while your enemies were watching just struck me funny and Ive been giggling about it off and on for a day. Its nice to know that some things never change and that men have felt selfconscious on the dance floor since at least the Hellenistic period.Remember Seneca also saidgtWe should make light of all things and endure them with tolerance it is more civilized to make fun of life than to bewail itand gt All things considered it is the mark of a greater mind not to restrain laughter than not to restrain tears since laughter expresses the gentlest of our feelings and reckons that nothing is great or serious or even wretched in all the trappings of our existence.And I dont recall the reference at the moment but I do recall one Stoic describing sailors on a sinking ship philosophizing about their imminent death even as the water washed over the deck.

2127102,0,t3_2jb0xd,I am a white straight cisgendered  year old male.That being said looking at the founders of Stoicism all seven of the Scholarchs of the Stoa were foreigners. Zeno was from Cyrus of Phoenician descent Cleanthes was from Turkey Chrysippus was from Turkey and was said to speak terrible Greek Zeno of Tarsus was from modern day Turkey Diogenes of Babylon was from modern day Iraq Antipater of Tarsus was from modern day Turkey and Panaetius was from Rhodes. None of the scholarchs in Athens were from mainland Greece. All of them would have most likely picked up Greek as a second language with the possible exception of Panaetius. Then this Greek religion went to Rome it was foreign in its new home. Then we must remember that Seneca was from Spain and Epictetus was Turkish slave.Stoicism can definitely thrive regardless of racial barriers. Gender we can only extrapolate from Zeno of Citium who being Crates pupil would have great reverence for Hipparchia Crates wife. Their Cynic marriage cynogomy was offensive to modern day active because they treated each other as equals and Hipparchia dressed like a man to show that she was equal to her husband. The founder of Stoicism Zeno being so influenced by Cynic thought that his Republic was thought to have been written by the tail of the dog would certainly welcome women. I believe a later thinker perhaps Chrysippus also reasoned that because men and women reason alike they are the same metaphysically. Thus men and women do not differ. We can expand this into any genderssexs in between these two points. If they can reason there is no barrier in Stoicism.Stoicism can definitely thrive regardless of gender barriers. Sexual orientation is slightly more complicated. Musonius Rufus writes against homosexuality and his influence to Marcus Aurelius cause Aurelius to be the first to band pederasty. Now Stoicism as a Greek religion  philsophy would have been totally ok with these actions because it was part of their culture. Thus the stigma of sexual orientation or behaviour falls into the cultural realm  the social norm. Diogenes asks the Cynics which Zeno was influenced by to deface the currency to challenge cultural norms. Early Stoics would have accepted this perspective in part. Stoics move with society to change society. At the same time since Stoicism operates in regards to our reason only reason is essential to the self all is accidental. Having accidentals like blonde hair or brown hair being tall or short being from the West or East male or female or straight or gay and everything in between falls into categories the Stoic needs not worry about for it is up to us to cultivate good reason first and foremost. If that is the aim all else falls to side. Stoicism can definitely thrive regardless of the barriers of sexual orientation.,Stoicism,cla791a,2,t5_2r4kq

2610532,0,t3_2pp3a6,This is particularly interesting having just finished rereading Julian Jaynes The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind.I think we can assume that Chuang Tzus writing harkens back to a time when these true men were fully bicameral. This means per Jaynes theory that they lacked metaconsciousness. Stoicism is born of reflection on the self I think. Chuang Tzus true men were naturally noble in one way  but also so in a way that is unachievable by us as we are not bicameral. Modern humans with selfawareness of the metaconscious sort cannot grasp what that ancient mindset was truly like.,Stoicism,cmzc180,3,t5_2r4kq

I dont think you have to be as harsh as others suggest.Admit that its a terrible thing to lose a loved one for starters. Emphasize that the deceased individual doesnt benefit from the continued suffering of their loved ones. Focus on how they can make the best of their lives by admitting that the death of even our closest friends amp family is out of our hands and by moving on to live a good life without them as hard as it may initially be. Encourage them to live a life those we left behind would be proud of a life they themselves could be proud of. Focus them on the present and the immediate future rather than letting them dwell on the past and the impossible future.,Stoicism,cnzvzcc,1,t5_2r4kq
2924288,0,t3_2tmjq5,I wrote something about dealing with haters using philosophy Stoic philosophy. You can check out my website if you like but Ill copypasta the whole article here.gt People are going to hate you. Deal with it.gt gt You cannot be loved by everyone  its just not possible. If you try to be liked by everyone youll end up suffering the opposite effect  youll be hated by everyone for being such an obvious people pleaser. If you start to better yourself  losing weight working on your lifes passion raising your confidence breaking out of depression  the people around you that suffer from these same issues will instead of cheering you on try to pull you back down. This happens because you make them look bad by comparison but thats not your fault its theirs. If youre living according to a philosophy of life then the people who dont live the way you live will assume youre judging them for not living up to the same standards that you hold yourself to. If you become more successful then the people who wish they were as bold as you for not fearing failure will hate you because they are envious of your ability to overcome that fear.gt gt Success is sometimes a hard thing to navigate. You are virtually invisible if you arent successful in some way and you think incorrectly that when you do attain some level of success the attention youll get will all be in the form of praise for your accomplishments but it seems the opposite happens  people start talking more shit. They may even challenge undermine or try to minimize your accomplishments. Long story short no matter what people are going to hate on you. Now how can ancient philosophy help with these modern day haters?gt gt Well in a previous post I talked about the foundation of Stoicism which is knowing what is and what is not in your control. One of the things on the list of things you dont have control over is the opinions of others and thats the first thing you should realize when you find out someone is hating on you  you have zero control over their opinions about you. Yeah you can try to be a good person but like I said theyll just hate you for making them look bad in comparison. Do the things that make you happy and fuck what other people say. I mean unless you want to fail. Ask yourself do really successful people go with or against the grain? Do they listen to the people in their lives that try to minimize what theyre doing? Or do they go out there and do it?gt gt The next thing you should do is to take the advice of Epictetus  a Stoic philosopher Remember that what insults you isnt the person who abuses you or hits you but your judgement that such people are insulting you. For example say that youre starting to go bald or that you have already gone bald and someone makes fun of you for being as such. Is this really an insult? Are you in fact bald? Seneca  another Stoic philosopher and politician  asks us Why is it an insult to be told what is self evident? So the next time someone tries to mock you on something that is obviously true  being overweight hopefully your working to improve the things you can control though being bald or having some other physical abnormality  you can just respond with something like Wow youre so observant arent you? or you could say as Epictetus says You obviously dont know me very well because if you did then you would have mentioned my other much greater faults and not something so blatantly obvious.gt gt Another tactic in dealing with insults is to yet again listen to what Epictetus saysgt gt  Remember that he is acting or speaking in that way because he regards that as being the proper thing for him to do. Now it isnt possible for him to act in accordance with what seems right to you but only with what seems right to him. So if he judges wrongly he is the one who suffers the harm since he is the one who has been deceived.gt gt This is kind of a hard thing to master. Heres an example of this I have a friend that is upset with me for not working a normal eighttofive job and instead putting all my efforts in to my dream this blog. He thinks Im making a mistake Im going to end up broke this blog is going to fail and Im going to be worse off than I am now for doing it. I think hes wrong he thinks Im wrong. Its hard to not want to argue your view but you must realize that some people cant or wont see things the way you see them. And you dont have time to care youre too busy succeeding. Not to mention it is out of your control.gt gt Heres yet another thing to consider about insults  who exactly is doing the insulting? What kind of person are they? Do you value this persons opinion? Do you not? Are this persons opinions on the matter educated opinions? Seneca mentions that some of these people are nothing more than overgrown children who differ from children only in the size and shape of their bodies. So the same way a parent would dismiss the insults of their young child so should you dismiss the insults of these overgrown children. Also you should realize some of the people that insult you have severely flawed characters and should be pitied instead of becoming angry with them. We should regard insults from others as just a barking dog take note that the dog apparently doesnt like you but itd be ridiculous to let a dogs barking at you ruin your day.gt gt Now sometimes your haters could be valuable sources of information. If the person who has criticized you is a trusted friend or family member you should listen analyze what was said and determine if it holds any weight. If it does  fix it if it doesnt  dismiss it. But really you should listen to and analyze all criticisms because even haters will tell the truth in trying to hurt you. You need to be selfaware enough to not just think you are the most amazing person ever but you also need to be confident enough to stand your ground against the hate. This isnt easy thats for sure but it must be done.gt gt Okay I explained how to deal with insults and haters internally but how should  you respond to them?gt gt Well your instinct is to return fire in the form of a counterinsult but returning fire is out because that shows your hater that they rattled your cage. The best way to respond is with humor but this requires quick wit and skill to pull off. This post would be way too long if I covered all the ways to use humor and wit to deflect but I would suggest watching how comedians handle hecklers as a starting point. I already gave an example of using humor specifically light selfdepreciating humor earlier in the post Epictetus response to a an insult You obviously dont know me very well because if you did then you would have mentioned my other much greater faults and not something so blatantly obvious is a good example of using humor to deflect haters and its one of my favorites.gt gt You can also just laugh off insults in an amused manner. You cant laugh it off angrily or nervously but be amused by the insult or the hater giving the insult as if they were silly and beneath you or like mentioned before as coming from a child.gt gt If all else fails and you find yourself reduced to a stupor about an insult you just received and you arent quick witted enough or confident enough yet to respond in jest the next best thing is to just ignore the insult also in an amused manner. Now just because I listed this as the last resort doesnt mean it cant be used first instead. Like I said some of you will never be outgoing or quick witted enough to respond with humor so ignoring them can often be just as effective if not better because ignoring insults can be very aggravating to the insulter and just by saying nothing you end up making your aggravator the aggravated robbing the person of the pleasure of having upset you.gt gt One last thing  another gem from Epictetus If you want to improve be content to be thought foolish and stupid.,Stoicism,co0i1dw,4,t5_2r4kq

The outcome doesnt matter because it wouldnt have changed their actions at all. They do what they do because it is the only thing to do.EDIT Stoic tranquility is more liberating than hope.

Arguing against monogamy because it isnt natural opens the door to a whole host of behaviors that we consider to be unpleasant but are arguable from the vantage point of violence.Apples to oranges. Rape is intentionally harmful to others which is immoral making an appeal to nature for it is easily refuted. Polyamory is not intentionally harmful or inherently immoral so  an appeal to nature for it is not so easily dismissed. All appeals to nature cant be lumped into the same category otherwise we would be dismissing beneficial things like a natural diet just because rape is also natural.Polyamorys existence as a  year old evolutionary construct should not be taken lightly.

The perfect Stoic Sage is happy all the time because he is perfectly rational and thus perfectly virtuous.So I wouldnt say that Stoicism teaches you to do things you dont want to do because they are virtuous but rather to want to do only things that are virtuous.

I feel something important is missing. It seems to me that a teleological view of nature goes well with stoicism. Maybe that was their best understanding but maybe it was also a very usefull representation of the world for their philosophy. I feel that its desirable in order to accept difficulties to have a metaphysical conception in which things could not have been otherwise. More than that I guess that if some sort of a plan is followed then amor fati becomes even stronger. One could object that this philosophy was usefull giving this conception of the world.

I think the Stoic answer is that should be excellentvirtuous in all things or every aspect of your life.I am wary however of your use of the word passions when talking about Stoicism. You write that Stoic passions are more constant cultivated etc. I suppose this is true but I think more of an explanation is required.Going by Epictetus a stoic should consider what are their obligations before they consider what their passions should be if they should do at all.Knowing what you obligations are requires you to know the world around you and know your place in it hence know yourself.I think once you know this you can pursue your passions from this foundation.This was based on my reading of Enchiridion a month or so ago so everybody please feel free to criticize.,Stoicism,cwdlcrk,2,t5_2r4kq

Both of those philosophies advocated disengaging from politics whereas Stoicism said that citizens should engage as informed individuals with reason and a sense of duty. Thats why it was so appealing to many Latins later on who were very much engaged in the matters of state. Psychology has shown that unfortunately political inclinations are not as tied to the reason and logic centers in the brain as many believe. The challenge to the Stoic is to separate your views from the facts think critically as to why you have those views inform yourself if you find ignorance and then act as a citizen with your refined ideas.

I guess formalised the argument would beP A is Human.P A wants to be virtuous. P To be virtuous A must do what humans are designed to do.C A wants to do what humans are designed to do.I suppose the issue is premise . From what I understand ancient Stoics arrived at that conclusion by making the logical assumption that to be virtuous one needs to follow their function and left it at that.

You ask a question from Nature Can we function as a couple? or Does she have the same attraction towards me? and then you will get an answer.  You should never take any rejection as a personal failure. A rejection is just an experimental result which is dependent on  the current brainbiochemical states of the participants  the weather the lifesituation in which you are at that moment her period her personal past etc...So very few things you are responsible in any dating situation. The result of a dating experiment says how you two are compatible with each other and says very little about you personally. Of course you should behave as you think is right. Directed dating is a paradox situation because if you behave directly as you think she likes then you are giving up your true self to impress her. Of course there are certain behavioral patterns but if you just act as confident person then you are just an actor... You should behave as YOU think is right.I dont think that the PickUpArt narrative alphabeta male etc... would be useful in a long term because it teach you how to ACT and not how to be happy in your own skin. You would be with a female who loves You and not your alphamask which you wear to hide your needy nature...... True success when you can transcend these alphabetamale games and you can date without even bother about the endpoint of this experiment. I think Stoicism is a perfect alternative philosophy for dating. OF course you can prefer some results but you can be HAPPY in any case. She is NOT your key to happiness. None is.

8173010,0,t3_4r8xsb,gtHow does a proper stoic address a severe and long lasting lack of will brought on by chemical imbalance?At the time the Stoics were writing depression was widely known called melancholia but nobody knew the cause. Seneca attributed it to mostly something that arises out of our own thought pattern. Obviously now we know much of it is caused by chemical imbalance but Seneca wasnt entirely wrong. Look at the concept of the cycle of depression. What begins as a small imbalance in brain chemicals is made far worse because we label those things as bad. So I might have a not that bad imbalance but if I say wow this is really awful that makes it way worse which worsens the imbalance which worsens the reaction and so you have a vicious cycle. It is important to be clear though this does not mean that our thoughts and reactions cause depression just that they can significantly contribute to and worsen depression.So the Stoics werent entirely right. And who could blame them since they didnt have the science of our age? But still we need to do some imagination to figure what they would have thought had they had that information. And the first thing which might not be what you want to hear it isnt bad insofar as it is outside of our control. Virtue is the only and sole good. And virtue means living according to nature. Living the best life I can given the restraints that I have. If depression makes it harder for me to do things and so I dont accomplish as much Im not immoral as long as I still put as much effort in to living according to my nature as I possibly can. If anything though this would challenge the Stoic belief that virtue is necessary and sufficient for happiness. Insofar as brain chemicals are ultimately outside of my control it would technically be possible for a sage to be unhappy because of severe depression. But of course Stoicism teaches that happiness is ultimately not a good virtue is.Obviously this answer isnt entirely sufficient because as noted above depression is partially within our control. It is worsened by our thought patterns. The method of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been shown to be pretty effective at fighting depression and its based on Stoic teachings. So I think were the Stoics alive today they would direct people towards it. And additionally theres nothing wrong with medications. Antidepressants can help people and so they ought to take them as far as they are able to. Theres nothing wrong about that.Additionally I would note if you search depression in the search bar here youll read plenty of stories from people experiencing various mental illnesses especially anxiety and depression and noting that even if Stoicism could not completely eliminate it it vastly improved their lives.gtId imagine each of the big  had their own inner demons. How did they treat the crumbling of their own Inner Citadel?You would imagine correctly. Epictetus was a slave Seneca was exiled by one emperor and assassinated by another and Marcus Aurelius was emperor over an absolutely awful period of Roman history. For brevitys sake Ill omit details on Epictetus and Seneca if you read their works you can see more of their views on suffering. I would especially recommend Senecas essay On Providence in which he argues that it is impossible for bad things to happen to wise people because only virtue is good and nothing not even depression can take virtue away from us.Marcus Aurelius has a really interesting case. As emperor he faced multiple invasions attempted rebellion against him potential disloyalty from his wife disease in fact the worst disease in Romes history hunger financial collapse natural disaster dangers of the mob... And as a Stoic he didnt particularly enjoy all of the extravagance surrounding the imperial title. He was also forced to leave Rome and he spent his later life the time period he wrote his Meditations along the northern border rather than the city which was his home.All of these factors combine for a pretty dark picture. If you read Meditations youll see this its definitely the darkest of the Stoic texts Marcus is consistently reminding himself to cast out anxiety and fear and hes constantly thinking about death and disloyalty. Even though he was a philosopher he could not continue free from harm he struggled tremendously with what he faced. But I think only a Stoic could bear that much pressure. He constantly reminds himself that he has a duty that as a virtuous rational being he cannot turn his back on Rome. And he continued to face his challenges challenges which as the Stoics believe allow him to become virtuous. Marcus probably wasnt depressed but I think he still faced considerable hardship.Two quotes from the Stoics are excellent explanations their position first Seneca said As fire tries iron so adversity tries wise men. Adversity is the test of our virtue if being virtuous requires a strong mind a strong will adversity is what allows us to practice that to work towards that.Second Marcus saidgtOur inward power when it obeys nature reacts to events by accommodating itself to what it facesto what is possible. It needs no specific material. It pursues its own aims as circumstances allow it turns obstacles into fuel. As a fire overwhelms what would have quenched a lamp. Whats thrown on top of the conflagration is absorbed consumed by itand makes it burn still higher.The obstacles we face allow us to keep going. And we have to really because its our duty. As rational beings we cant abandon reason. As social beings we cant abandon society. We have to rise to our potential even when that may be challenging. Certainly it is more impressive to climb a  foot hill than a  foot hill likewise it is greater to overcome great difficulties than mild ones.Now Im not as eloquent as Seneca  I would recommend if you want something more in depth than this that you read On Providence.

8511697,0,t3_4wb38r,Well a few things. First I think its wonderful you are already seeing tangible benefits. Just a month and a half! Thats impressive no? But surely it takes more time than that. You mention social anxiety. Thats a serious condition. I dont know how severe yours is. But certainly that wont go away in a month. And likewise you wont start living perfectly in a month either. These things arent easy and they take time. The fact that youve already made some progress is great. Keep up what youre doing.Second you appear to be focusing more on your own personal happiness I could be wrong this is just what I gather from your post. Stoicism is a complex ethical philosophy. It will lead to personal satisfaction yes but that is not the goal. In fact if you emphasize personal happiness youre probably less likely to get it! If you read Senecas essay On The Happy Life which I would highly recommend he makes a compelling case that we should pursue virtue alone and for virtues own benefit. Happiness might follow but that is a secondary benefit and not the leading motivation behind it. Third you appear to be focusing on things beyond your control. What does success even mean? Success as defined by who? If its success defined by others thats outside your power. Its irrational to focus on it. And it cant be good anyways since only things within our power can be good. If its success defined by you meet your definition. And if thats not possible well change your definition given that it is irrational to worry about things outside of our power and nothing outside of our power can be good. Fourth be careful not to overthink. Seneca actually advises against constantly repeating Stoic maxims! Whats much more important is simple reminders. If you constantly watch over yourself and try to rebuke every mistake you turn one kind of anxiety into another. Rather you can gain much more ground by reframing. That is change the point from which you view a situation. Say someone is rude to you. You might initially think how can I get back at this person but you can reframe that thought as how can I show this person kindness given they most likely havent seen it in a while? Or say you are worrying about an upcoming event. Instead of thinking this event will be really bad if it happens you could think how could something outside of my power be good?. And after a while thinking in a more rational fluent way will just come more naturally.,Stoicism,d65ipb6,15,t5_2r4kq

If so this too would not necessarily be stoic. If you have done your duties for the day or dont let it hinder your duties than I think it comes down to being a preferred indifferent. Sometimes smoking a little can give me a new perception on things and lead me to a new insight. Sometime I use it just to relax or as a creative tool.

I want to be an investigative reporter more than anything so I try to do muckrackingtype journalism and it has mixed results. If you stir things up too much in a small town people get mad.Anyways I wrote a pretty controversial story about something going on here and got accused of misquoting a public official. He still hasnt explained specifically how I misquoted him although Ive gone from trusting myself to doubting myself and back and forth. The other newspaper in town one I quit writing for a few months ago because I didnt like its ethics or lack of mentioned me misquoting this official in their story.I was stressing out over it thinking Id lose my brand new wellpaying job worrying my career is over etc. Very unstoic like behavior. I was listing endless scenarios on what I should have done whats going to happen how my life is going to be ruined...you get the idea.I actually saw this post while I was spazzing out and trying to get my mind off of it. It reminded me that the past is gone and theres nothing I can really do about it. As for the future theres no need worrying. I only have control of the present and so I need to focus on being virtuous and learning from my potential mistake.tldr stop whining and picking your own brain apart. Just learn your lesson do what needs to be done and keep going.,Stoicism,d7xjwz9,1,t5_2r4kq

9183956,0,t3_55zsyn,Two frameworks come to mind. These are things I actively pay attention to when dealing with my family  it makes the interaction smoother and keeps me calm having some game to focus on. Have fun with it! I mean to the degree possible. Its hard realizing that you are more adult and mature than your parents. Its a little lonely. And thats ok.  . Level of escalation. This is the easy one  my goal in our conversations is to prevent escalation no matter how much they bait me. Obama is a secret Muslim? How interesting  have you had dinner yet? Oh really lemon cures cancer and they are keeping it secret? Yeah its been a while since I had lemon! . Try to be aware of what raw emotion they are acting on. This one is a little harder but so worth it. My mother acts out of fear constantly. Listens to tons of Fox news constantly afraid loves to argue about how naive I am. All I have to do to shut it down is change the topic to something that makes her feel safe and understood like talking about her garden or her last visit. If I then bring up bills source of fear she will launch back into the Fox news shit. She doesnt WANT to spend her time feeling afraid and angry if I give her an alternative she will take it. So... I do that. Of course keep in mind that these are for YOU to make the interaction better for YOU. We cant control others crazy but we can keep from being dragged down with it wholesale.Good luck. EditJust remembered my favorite raw emotion response story. Whenever I leave at the end of  a visit my mother will start crying and guilting me REALLY bad about leaving her alone etc. Solution? I pick a huge fight with her about an hour before Im set to leave. By the time I have to go shes practically throwing me out! D,Stoicism,d8g4tw2,5,t5_2r4kq

9529182,0,t3_5bco61,It depends on you different introductions are best for different people. . If you are currently in poverty imprisoned suffering from a major disease or suffering other similar hardships I would recommend starting with Epictetus. Incidentally if you want an accurate understanding of what he is talking about I recommend reading the Discourses before the Enchiridion. The Enchiridion was intended as a set of reminders about topics covered in the Discourses and the most natural understanding at least in English translations of a some of the passages in the Enchiridion is probably not what Epictetus had in mind and the longer discussions in the Discourses make Epictetuss views clearer. . If you are physically comfortable but have a high pressure job or are otherwise stressed out by responsibility Marcus Aurelius would be my recommendation.. If your circumstances are generally comfortable you are not suffering any major hardship and stress from responsibility is not a major issue for you but rather a general sense of meaninglessness lack of purpose or low selfesteem then Seneca is probably your best bet.. If you prefer something in a selfhelp style with modern easy to understand instructions inspired by historical Stoic works but with modern influences as well I recommend Stoicism and the Art of Happiness by Donald Robertson.. If you are more interested in a systematic understanding of the philosophy on a theoretical level so that your interpretations of the often rather cryptic statements by Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus can be improved by the many additional lesser known fragments and accounts of Stoic thought as a system Id start with an academic overview. The Stoics A Guide for the Perplexed by Andrew Holowchak Stoics Epicureans and Sceptics An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy by R. W.

9626188,0,t3_5cv0b8,gtMy point is this wouldnt the more appropriate stoic response be in how to deal with such a situation respect your emotions grieve as you should but remember to be virtuous and happy at the end?Generally emotions are considered to stem from moral judgments of the world some believe them to be judgments themselves but I find that unlikely for reasons I wont go into here. These judgments are generally wrong and thus most emotions are incorrect. There are a few emotions based entirely on internals iirc joy caution and wishing but I might have screwed one of those up. gtIts almost like walking outside in freezing weather and Epictetus telling you that you should not feel cold instead of saying you will feel cold but youll be okay and sometimes taking comfort in something uncomfortable will only help you grow as a human being.Kind of. If youre walking in the cold you would get an impression that tells you I am feeling cold. this is a perfectly valid impression.If the impression you get is I am feeling cold and this is a bad thing. that is a judgment based on an external and should not be assented to. ,Stoicism,d9zmjkb,3,t5_2r4kq

10386220,0,t3_5oqwp2,Im not the best person to offer an opinion but in my novice understanding of Stoicism this article paints an inaccurate picture right?gt On the surface this approach might seem practical. But Holiday fails to see how emotions are directly tied to our actions. We are angry about Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood so we call our state representatives to object we are scared about encroachments upon the freedom of speech so we join the American Civil Liberties Union.Cant you call a representative because you believe something is wrong without being angry?  Or join a Union because we believe encroachments would be wrong rather than out of fear?This seems to imply that Stoics are less likely to act morally than others.Edit I should clarify something.  I dont mean to imply that feeling anger is wrong and that it should be stifled.  In the above example one could feel angry and use that as a trigger to their thinking Ok Im really angry about this.  That usually means I should calm down until I can think more rationally and decide what to do.  Of course there are some times where that luxury isnt available like defending someones life from attack.  But in the above examples I dont believe any valid case is being made that holding on to the emotion provides some advantage or leads to a morally superior act.gt But we shouldnt stop there. The point is neither to stifle our emotions nor to simply share them and console one another. Instead we can channel our feelings toward grassroots struggle. On Jan.  the day after Trumps inauguration womenled marches in cities around the world will protest Trump and his values. This is a mass movement of affective dissent. It is ardently lifeaffirming and mobilizing passionate angry and bold.What about Stoicism prevents protests?  If one believes that a protest might sway someones opinion or make a statement and that it would be good for the opinion to be swayed or the statement to be made is not a Stoic free to do so?In Epictituss society protests might have led to futility punishment or death I dont know.  But applying Stoicism in our day shouldnt mean an end to protests that Im aware of.This article had more a feel of reactionism to me than an enlightening or educational piece.

There is no point being anxious as you are a wonderful complex human being. You will learn as you go along. Anxiety is the worry that one of a pair of opposites will win over the other.

Nature capital N is more along the lines of depending on context the universal reason Logos Zeus or your ideal naturewhich distinct from your overall nature is not according to Stoicism hedonistic and instead consists of rationality and social behavior altruism.,Stoicism,dfvytkx,3,t5_2r4kq
11468906,0,t1_dfjlmqd,I can answer this.Yes his being better makes everyone else worse. He or any other perfect person is a living embodiment of why youre a bad person. If he didnt exist there would be room for you to be loved admired and to have selfrespect things I assume Stoics wouldnt understand. Instead theres an objective marker that youre worthless and bad. You are competing youre competing in life. Superior people hate and are disgusted by inferiors. Theyd have us exterminated if they could. They look at us with the disgust we deserve. And since theyre perfect their opinions matter more  theyre more qualified they have more value. They will have more success. They can be loved for who they are. Inferior people dont have that luxury. If you think people are all equal youre deluding yourself. Envy and feelings of inferiority are completely rational and part of stoicism seems to be rationalizing them away.,Stoicism,dfvztdy,0,t5_2r4kq
11521302,0,t3_64gc6k,The Stoics were opposed to complacency see this FAQ question and there is very general instruction concerning when contribute to society as well as you can act justly but not much on specific concrete situations. The closest is in Ciceros On Duties Cicero was not himself a Stoic but was influenced by Stoicism and On Duties in particular was a paraphrase of a now lost book by the Stoic Panaetius. The advice there is in the context of an absurdly primitivereactionary society from a modern point of view but I think it gives some idea of how the Stoics thought their general instructions could be put into practice in concrete situations.edit Senecas On the Happy LIfe On the Shortness of Life and On Tranquillity of Mind are also at least somewhat relevant.,Stoicism,dg1xwc7,2,t5_2r4kq

One part talks about duty with many of Marcuss quotes. Other parts talk about not letting others control your thoughts and time . . . Nothing is perfect. I remember a quote of Ryans from Obstacle.

Instead of becoming a sage thinking that when you do it is all done think of becoming the man that every day evaluates his actions and is constantly working to be more virtuous. I use the sage as an idea to guide me in this What would a sage do? is a good way to help me figure out where to improve. I feel good when Im improving even if im not there yet. And when i fail i take that as a good teacher that tells me where I need to work on.Become a person that constantly evaluates his actions mindfully and improves constantly. This method in itself is very powerful.,Stoicism,dgpx7z8,1,t5_2r4kq
