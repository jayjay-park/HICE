I agree that the more RP the better but do not think it would be good to shut off all OOC talk. Side note its also nice to see people kindly reminding and educating people on how IC chat should be happening. Some of us are new and could use the help. An example of this is when I was looking for Lily a few days ago. I was asking if Lily was online as I was interested in the adoption of a Quetz to add to my family. Someone kindly said Lily is currently asleep but we will let her know you are inquiring when she awakes.

Want to kill me and then justify that with saying it was all RP. Stop being salty.? That I am not ok with.

Every time I hop on my fastest bird and hope there is someone there without a good reason so I can drop them from the skybox to appease my frustration. But there are somethings it is pretty much unavoidable for. Basically all giga and quetz tames end up in that area because the games pathing system takes them there when they start to run. Same thing with alphas if you cant kill them fast enough. Sucks but you cant expect me to not finish killing the alpha rex I have been whittling down with my ptera for half an hour.

7425098,0,t3_4gx3m3,Ill hit on a couple items here as there seem to be several in discussiongtYou may not have turrets on your passive pen. Only plant turrets that defend from wilds. If you have normal auto turrets your pen does not fall in the passive pen guidelines.This is correct. Passive pens are just that  a place to put passive dinos so they cannot be accidentally killed during raids. That does not mean they cannot be stolen from  but anyone doing so should realize the risk associated with it. Killing a passive dino in a passive pen by accident is no excuse and will be handled as if it had been done deliberately. Fair warning. And just to make sure it is clear if War is formally declared once the cooldown time is up  passive pens ARE fair game. War is War and everything goes barring anythng that would violate specific server rules ie racism hate speech etcgt If you leave the area for any reason you cant go back. Back when I played we were warned that if we left to grab anything from back home we could not come back to a raid. If you leave youve left.The ever elusive Mickey is correct here. Raids are a hitandrun activity. You cannot keep a chain of people theregoing back and forth to increase your loot. You go raid  you succeed and book it with your loot or fail and decide if you want to try again tomorrow. gt As long as one person remains in the area I am pretty sure its okay to send someone back to base for something. But maybe thats because I just dont see anything wrong with it. Plus there really isnt anything in the rules about it. shrug ive looked lolThe once per  hour rules is specifically there to prevent ongoing griefing. Anyone who dies or leaves the location of the raid for any reason is out and needs to stay away. Anyone found trying to skirt this will be dealt with harshly. Play fair or dont play.gt The rules say that raids can ostensibly be about denying resources not denying the means to make things. If your fabricators industrial forges and chemistry tables were all unlocked I would not interpret it as legal to blow them up because you wanted to deny the tribe the ability to craft things. That is an extremely liberal interpretation of the raid rules that basically permits destroying anything except the shell of the base.The key word in regards to destroying things during a raid is resources specifically in relation to denying them from someone else. If a structure is locked and likely to contain things  breaking it open is acceptable. It is a choice to have things locked after all. Deliberately destroying a noncontainer structure because it has usage? Rather dickish. If you want to deny someone resources then take them for yourself. In the examples listed in the conversation if I wanted to deny a rival breeder resources I could steal their kibble stash or even raid their refrigerator and take their stored eggs fertilized or otherwise. Destroying their ACs for the purpose of denying them functionality is not necessary and just serves to set people back in terms of playing the game. IF you want to go that far  just fucking declare War. If not just rob them and run away. It is really that simple.,jurassickingdoms,d2m6oqu,1,t5_39qrd

7599835,0,t3_4jdgrm,I was just making sure I didnt miss something and everyone left for good. Ive been using this time to experiment with engrams and various items I didnt normally pick. I can say that I think Im addicted to having a shield now. Ill be on if anyone hops on for a bit. We can go on Dino hinting quests for the hell of it.,jurassickingdoms,d362a5a,2,t5_39qrd
7607678,0,t1_d36y5ul,No no no I just wanted people to discuss where they wanted to be so you could work out a peaceful agreement instead of everyone just trying to get to one spot and claim it. If you dont want the thread its fine I just thought it would be helpful D,jurassickingdoms,d36ybzz,1,t5_39qrd
7618198,0,t1_d381enf,Another problem is that folks who wanted to do the RP shenanigans were dishearteneddiscouraged because everyone fell off the face of the Earth. Going around and RPing with folks requires folks to be online so it built off itself. ,jurassickingdoms,d385e7k,2,t5_39qrd

7772052,0,t1_d3plwle,I dont care about brontos and paracer  they are not going to be used in offensive scenarios.An armored quetz operating as a fob  is not a problem in my eyes. They wont have offensive powers outside of troop movements which I am again fine with. Without turrets it will not be hard to rocket a quetzal down armored  or not. Also as far as I am aware the devs have recently made it so you can not box in a rider cant confirm as I have not tested but everyrhing Ive read seems to support this but with no offensive powers a driver on a quetz is essentially taking a manwoman out of your fight so again I feel that is fine. The power of the quetz was always in its complete destructive capabilities. With those gone they are lame ducks for war purposes. There is little reason to remove platform at this point and at the very least I felt these changes warranted an open discussion something that never happened before on the issue. ,jurassickingdoms,d3pmbih,3,t5_39qrd
7772594,0,t1_d3pjtne,Ive started reading many a webcomic only to have that happen. Sure its a huge fuckin bummer when it comes screeching to a halt midarc but id rather have gotten to enjoy some of it as opposed to none at all.,jurassickingdoms,d3pojex,1,t5_39qrd
7780561,0,t3_4lvvzm,Really wish I had something to say to change your mind but I dont think words will work at this point.I really have no words to describe the grief that I am feeling right now I love the JK community Ive met  of my steam friends from server alone. Since most of you know Im not good with out of RP emotions.The long end of it all I hope you find a stress free server game life whathaveyou. If you ever want to game or anything Lict just hit me on Steam Im here for ya.To say what everyone else is saying Excluding Tom. Its very sad to see you go and the server to stop being around but I do hope once again that you find peace and eventually maybe JK can be revived.,jurassickingdoms,d3ql2ua,7,t5_39qrd
