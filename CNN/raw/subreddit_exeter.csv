9085095,0,t1_d83mtwr,Just take the Sidmouth Road out of Exeter  Follow signs for Crealy Adventure Park and drive straight past it towards the Halfway Inn. Take the right turn at the Inn and follow the road for a mile. Youll soon cone across a left and right turn opposite each other. Left is the fort and a great walk right is the view called Top of the World. Best at night time. I spent new years with my Girlfriend up there with a pizza and watched the fireworks. Edit About a half an hour drive.,exeter,d83vpko,2,t5_2s3cs
