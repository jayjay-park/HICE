I was raised in a christian family went to church every Sunday until I was  often attended Sunday school spent multiple years in private christian schools member of awana like a christian boy scout for a couple years baptized twice once as a baby once later in life by my choosing even attended a christian bible camp once. Although the more I learned the less sense a lot of it made. Eventually I starting looking up science outside of what I was taught by christian academia. Wow it was a big eye opener. Everything I was taught were either malicious lies or ignorance. A lot of these people were smart people its hard for me to accept they were all ignorant. I dont think they were only lying to me though I think a lot of them are lying to themselves trying to hold together their beliefs. I know my dad will occasionally try to argue against evolution morals or whatever he can and I think my mom just tries to not believe that Im an atheist. I know what I went through the brain washing and the personal struggles with belief and guilt.

Dollar draft all the time . long necks  every day and all day Tuesday and  imports on Friday.  It is next to Superiors Steakhouse. Ivans is another good smaller bar. The best steak in town is at The Cub which is also a bar. If you want water with a Louisiana feel I would suggest Lake Bisteneau. Edit apparently a couple of folks have had bad experiences with the Cub.   That sucks.  It is the only restaurant where I will order a steak.  Otherwise I would prefer to just cook one at home.  They also have amazing potatoes au gratin and all of their dressings are made from scratch daily.  I recommend the red wine vinaigrette.  I also get an appetizer that isnt on the menu.  Fried shrimp with the soft shell crab batter.  It comes with rebounded and it is amazing.   I usually put a little lemon on it.  I also dont know what steaks these folks have gotten and not liked but I always get a filet.  And Brad is one of the best servers ever. ,shreveport,cj6fgho,3,t5_2sd75

Ive only been a handful of times but each time it was great and they have poetry night Thursdays and an adult game night Fridays so there is that. Check out the Robinson Film Center if youre in the mood for indieforeign films and the restaurant above it Abby Singers Bistro. There are usually things to do if you stay plugged in like we have a few concerts coming up fashion and art show standup comedy music and vendors fair symphony orchestra etc. All that within the next week or two so yeah when people complain that there is nothing to do it is usually because they dont take the time to search for local events.
