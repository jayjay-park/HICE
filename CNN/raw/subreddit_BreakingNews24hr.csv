8122907,0,t3_4qh824,Unfortunately the USA has a seriously vested interest in Saudi Arabia so you will not see such changes.  Yes this prince is a fool.  You can never trust a fool prince born into entitlement whom has never had hardships to even remotely think of the people he leads or actual strategic military campaigns because he has been tainted by too much money and too many weapons.  You will see Saudi Arabia slowly fall from power and eventually become a new Syria.  Especially because of oil.  They will become more assertive and aggressive as the fool prince sees his own money dwindle and has a meltdown like any privileged children.  Expect Saudi to fall and expect to see them wage a lot more completely stupid campaigns in order to assert their dominance.,BreakingNews24hr,d4t35we,1,t5_3e84d
