Seth plays some deep underground techno music. Its chill its relaxed. When people come to his party they know what to expect some drinks deep conversations and  deep house.Now Seths neighbor throws a party.  people show up. Neon teens with pacifiers glow sticks and bro tanks show up. All of the current in your face music is played by the biggest DJs. Big room trap electro house dubstep you name it. Its fucking crazy. Lasers pyrotechnics confetti and paint is everywhere. The crowd came and got exactly the experience they wanted. Now Seth comes out of his house and sees his neighbors party. He takes in what hes seeing and starts to yell over to his neighbors party.What are you doing?! That isnt real music! Everyone who is musically enlightened is at MY party! Youre doing it wrong! You wouldnt know a good time if it smacked you in your face! All your DJs are dicks!

However one could argue that he was experimental in that he was an innovator in early electronic dance music. Synthesizers are experimental in nature and he was creating pop music of an imagine future. Just because its pop music doesnt mean it is not experimental sure its not as far out as the less assessable industrial music of the time. He was a pioneer and experimentation comes with the terrain.If you listen to that Daft Punk song Giorgio by Moroder he claims to synch a click track to the moog modular in s.

It was everything i expected out of it. The bieber song was probably top three on there actually. The whole part of theirs just seemed extremely sloppy and was a last second effort to take the show above and beyond the greatness that it already was. Diddy needed to do his part and go home.

Plenty of subreddits our stepping out of this fight its just not our problem. We are here with one duty and one duty only.

4482541,0,t3_3cc56f,Im gonna throw in a couple songs that blow me away and are from different genres. Psytrance The Tribe  Vini Vici Some of the most powerful current psytrance I know.TechTrance The Evil ID  Mark Sherry The God of TechTrance. A serious banger saw him in Toronto and was BLOW AWAY by his set. Drum and Bass Full Colour  Spor Hes also known as Feed Me which you might be more familiar with. His newest Spor album is DnB goodness with a splash of Dubstep. Full Colour is one of my favorite tracks on the album a really good DnB track with a melody that makes me want to dance. Hardstyle I was stuck between Release  Atmozfears and Fck EDM  RanD so heres both. Release is some seriously melodic Hardstyle with catchy as vocals. Atmozfears is slowly becoming one of my favorite current producers in the scene. Fck EDM is epic stomping Hardstyle that makes me want to scream FUCK EDM! and jump around. Good times. Vocal Trance Satellite  Oceanlab If you havent checked out Oceanlabs trance stuff and you like trance DO IT!New Trance Satellite  Tritonal Some people dislike the slower booming trance stuff but I still love the melodies and vocals in it. Tritonal is dope one of my favorites Ive seen live and that was before I knew who they were. ElectronicaDowntempo Prophet  Pretty Lights Just like dim the lights close your eyes and get in the zone for something that will take your breath away. I wasnt a huge fan of Pretty Lights when I first heard his stuff but now its my ideal relaxation music or driving music with a bassy twist. Drumstep Spooky Jack And His Living Dead Symphony  Varien amp Razihel Ever been like Dubstep is too slow bruh. Well this is like BOOM fuckin hype Dubstep with a faster Drum amp Bass style beat. Techno B  Eekkoo Groovy as hell with a really sick bassline that makes you bounce. Upbeat Techno at its best. Also Glow  Cirez D will always get my vote as the greatest Tech song in existence because its bomb dot com. Uplifting Trance Battle of the Barrels  Ferry Tayle Ever wanted to close your eyes and get swept away to a land of beautiful melodies and trance waves? Ferry Tayle delivers this experience. Hardcore Stronger  Stonebank Dont let the genre name scare you away its melodic its catchy its like  BPM greatness. Dubstep Buckshot  Datsik Its like a wall of bass in the best possible way. Also I just realized the fucking backwards F and P together that everyone wears at Dubstep shows is FirePower Records. God damn thats why my basshead buddy was decked out in FP gearProg House I Think Sweet Escape  Alesso Its a really nice song that has a drop that makes me want to dance and escape with nothing to stop me now. All seriousness though Swedish producers tear up the Prog House shit and if you have somehow not heard it check out any and all of Axwel  Ingrossos stuff. TechHouse Rebel XX  Pryda It was also known as Shrine ID until like yesterday when it was officially released. Eric Prydz does some amazing work under his alias Pryda some really deep techhouse stuff. Eric Prydz is his more mainstream music and Cirez D is his techno stiff. Really cool guy has about a million and a half aliases and each release totally different music. Mad talent and groovy songs. Melbourne Bounce Yee  Deorro Anything Melbourne Bounce is pretty hype but this is a banger of a track so if you like it then awesome check out Melbourne Bounce cuz its pretty hype. Electro House I Think The Electric Dream  Mord Fustang So I actually dont know what makes a song Prog House or Electro House but this song sounds super electronicy so Im calling it ElectroHouse even though its a pretty Progressive song and I actually label it in iTunes as Prog House. Either way Mord Fustang aside from having a weird name is a really dope producer whos entire new album is solid and Taito and this song are two of my favorite Electroy songs out there. Hope you enjoyed my MultiGenre Banger list! ,EDM,csvov9i,1,t5_2qm8v

4792065,0,t3_3giup2,I think you answered your own question.  The remix means they remixed the song.  They took the original sounds called stems and modified them in some way while adding their own sounds and spin on it. Sometimes the remixer tries to keep the main riffs and melodies the same while changing other parts of it.  Other times the remix is completely different from the original.To find the original just look for the song titleartist without the remix part.  For example Ivan Gough  In My Mind would be the original version of the track you mentioned.Edit link,EDM,ctykul3,1,t5_2qm8v

8504456,0,t1_d6440hl,gt I love other genres as well but nothing delivers that massive festival sound like big room does its the lifeblood of the mainstage.I dunno man.  Big room is definitely festival mainstage bangin kind of music but I remember before the mainstage was nothing but bigroom and IMO back then people rocked out WAY harder.  This is what I am thinking of.  Armin closing the mainstage of Ultra in  playing a straight up trance set probably the last time well see a real trance set on the UMF mainstage at night.  I was there and I was just starting to get into modern electronic stuff at the time.  I went into that weekend knowing nothing I didnt even know who Armin was.  Still to this day that is the best set I have ever seen in person and a big part of that was because people were DANCING.  I mean people were going fucking nuts by the end of this set.  I didnt know much about different genres at the time but even in my EDM noob state I could feel the difference between David Guettas set prior and this shit. I remember just being absolutely blown the fuck away by this Armin fellow.  I love to rage out to a big loud bigroom drop as much as the next guy but something like this is on a whole nother level imo and I really miss that.To me I dont think the problem is that big room is stale its that thats ALL there is on the mainstages.  I was at Ultra again this past year and while I saw some awesome sets on the mainstage Armin Steve Angello it seemed like every time I walked by there it was just the same fucking big room beat over and over and over and over and every now and then MAYBE somone would play a little bass house or trap.Thats the problem for me.  Its the oversaturation of big room.  Its like a cycle all the guys who want to make money make bigroom because thats whats on the big stages and since its such a basic sound to begin with theres only so much you do creatively.  I dont dislike bigroom I just dislike how prevalent it is.  When a set is nothing but bigroom drops one after the other it loses all the power.  And when you have hours and hours of it being played on a stage inevitably the crowd is going to start zoning out and losing interest.,EDM,d64m0kg,2,t5_2qm8v

8686587,0,t3_4yivhw,Techno seems like a good fit in terms of fast pounding BPM and general sound aesthetic. A lot of other genres of electronic music including trap and dubstep sound far too clean and computer processed for me even when they are playing dirty bass sounds with the tearing and wobbling that is common to those genres. There is a sheen to the music that is offputting to my ears. Certainly some techno has this problem too but these examples are a little more raw sounding. Like most electronic music techno is meant to be heard mixed with tracks layered on top of tracks so listening to all  minutes of these samples isnt really the intended use caseSilent Servant Ansome Blawan Ancient Methods Kangding Ray Zenker Brothers ,EDM,d6rg810,1,t5_2qm8v

Also the vocals in Time to Say Goodbye by Mr. Fijiwiji Direct and Aruna were written after Aruna the vocalist went through a rough breakup. Lastly Seven Lions  A Way to Say Goodbye is pretty somber.

10711509,0,t1_ddkslz3,gt Also I am more of a producer than a Dj so when I release songs theyre obviously the highest quality they can be but thats fair enough.If you are into production than you should definitely be looking for a pair of reference headphones like the DTs or a nice pair of studio monitors. If you dont have one already. Having that neutral sound is key when producing music. or so ive read amp been told I have next to no first hand experience here And yes there are plenty of deck options out there for under . I used the Serato Novation Twitch which was around . I like the compact design for traveling around doing gigs here and there. Its far from professional grade but I was more referring to the full spectrum of gear that youll collect eventually Headphones Speakers Decks Mixers Amps mics.... etc well maybe not Im a gear head. Ill close with a reminder that almost all of what Ive discussed is the ideal way to do things as far as audio quality goes and the vast majority of your audience will be oblivious to the imperfections. I hope I didnt make you worry too much about your event but I wanted to give you pointers for the future. ,EDM,ddkt8kw,1,t5_2qm8v

Swedish House Mafia is always a go but hey I havent been to Belgium in a few years and I think oldies are always goodies. Anyways ZHU is really fresh too I would say Working For It is one of my favorites by him. White Lines by Disclosure is a pretty good dancing song.

Hes put out some really great tracks in the last year.
