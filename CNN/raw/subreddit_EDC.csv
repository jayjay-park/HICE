92665,0,t1_ceoyfb7,Well this isnt everydaycarry.com is it? This is rEDC which is a different community with its own values and rules. I believe this subreddit is a welcoming and openminded place where everyone is free to share. Sure maybe real EDC is what you said but lets face it this subreddit is a LOT more casual than those dedicated forums out there where everyone carries five guns and seven knives in their camouflage cargo shorts every day. Not that theres anything bad about that kind of EDC but I think rEDC is for more than that. rEDC is about people from all walks of life sharing the gear that they live with. Yeah I can acknowledge that EDCs roots are about preparedness and practicality but it can evolve cant it? It can change grow and mix with other philosophies. The sidebar says Everyday carry EDC postings are really popular all over the internets. So Reddit... what are your essentials that you must carry on a daily basis? I see nothing about how a good post should only consist of useful stuff or emergency preparedness.  And so what if this is modern day pop music? Whats wrong with pop music? Do you think everyone should always listen to classic rock? Thats the way I interpret your comment criticizing this post. Just because you dont like what OP carries and think its useless doesnt mean its useless to OP or that it is a bad post or that other people shouldnt like it.EDIT Heres something from the new here? link on the sidebargtredc is about learning about what different people with a multitude of backgrounds from every corner of the globe value. Its about what things people perceive are so important that they feel the need to carry them daily.Again looks like this subreddit is a lot more casual than the site you quoted. If the stuff OP posted is truly important to him and has value to him and he does carry it every day I dont see how this is a bad post at all.,EDC,ceoz9q2,1,t5_2reni

419002,0,t3_1yvosd,I usually carry a separate knife and either a small SAK or a small Leatherman for their scissors.Today Im carrying a Benchmade Mini Grip complemented by a Leatherman Style for its scissors.And in the US knifelaws are some times covered under state and also municipal laws so this usually makes it inconvenient to travel through the US with a knife. I would stick to not carrying a knife or carrying a simple Swiss Army knife.,EDC,cfo71bz,5,t5_2reni
421823,0,t1_cfo679p,The previous pants I used LA Police Gear had a Dring and mag pocket on the front just below the waist so I clipped it on there and secured them in the pocket. That worked great except occasionally a ring would fall off the Sbiner into the pocket. Unfortunately that was the best feature of those pants and Ive since moved on.My current pants dont have the Dring so I keep the keys in a cargo pocket in the interior mag pocket if Im not carrying a spare mag which I often dont. I havent had any rings fall off this way yet.There must be a better way to carry the keys but I havent figured it out yet. Letting them hang freely from a belt is not an option because I dont like the noise they make and I suspect the rings might fall off this way. I lose a front pocket to my CCW because thats my preferred carry method by far. Maybe hanging from the belt and restrained by some type of sheath would work... anyone know of anything like this?,EDC,cfohjxy,2,t5_2reni

536799,0,t1_cfzpyf8,I recognize that not all cops are bad guys. I also recognize that cops are human and make mistakes which when combined with the ability to exercise deadly force occasionally results in tragedy. An American in the United States is  times more likely to be killed by a cop than a terrorist. Plus sometimes the rules and regulations of their jobs requires them to do silly things. Like when my friend had an exgf show up uninvited and literally break into his house back door in the middle of the night and attack his thencurrent gf while they were sleeping. Upon realizing what was going on he used reasonable force to defend the gf and put the exgf out the front door she got nothing but bruises from the handling. The exgf called  complained loudly about injuries made them load her up in the ambulance and they arrested HIM for battery while she grinned evilly. Go figure. Charges were dropped etc. once someone had time to investigate it but it cost him k and a night in jail and worst of all a permanent stain on his record. Every background check he has an infosec job requires him to relive that horrible night.  Oh and since his town is recently allowing CCW hes thinking about getting one but this is going to make that difficult if not impossible.,EDC,cg1ahhh,1,t5_2reni

I just keep a fan going in it and ive never had issues with fumes or anything. also if you dont want to pull the trigger quite yet you can get started by simply chaining batteries together. before my variable output supply I just used a bunch of those batteries you find in lawn mowers or scooters they looked like mini car batteries. Had three around combined well mixed and matched for different power that with some vs and I could get some cool colors.More importantly READ up on it. I started out with a crappy bath and copper wire. then went to steel wire and was still getting crap result though at least I was no longer copper coating my cathode. Eventually I learned to use Titanium wire. This trial and error was cause I was kinda figuring it out on my own. when I finally researched it I found a PLETHORA of helpful info. also dont use a diet coke bath Ive seen them online and the results are terrible. anyways before this becomes an essay PM me if you have any questions.,EDC,cinlnz2,1,t5_2reni

I would recommend an Israeli Bandage and quikclot if you have the room. The thing some of the people in this thread need to understand is that none of that with the exception of the Israeli Bandage is going to help with a gunshot wound. If you carry a gun or are in places where a shooting accidental or otherwise may happen youre going to need some specialized kit to have any real chance of being able to treat a GSW. Tourniquet is top of the list followed by quikclot chest seal be it a bag and tape or a commercial unit and nasopharyngeal airway. Youll need proper training for most of that but it doesnt hurt to have it maybe somebody else there knows how to properly use it but doesnt have it. I refer to the above as a blowout kit and I have one on my shooting bag I also know how to use it. Accidents happen. Build to what youre likely to need but I keep an Israeli Bandage and quikclot in my bag in case of major trauma booboo kit for everything else. ,EDC,cjt9lmm,1,t5_2reni

Phone is always front left knife is always front right and my keys on an sclip attached to a belt loop. My wallet Ill keep in my front right or a cargo pocket when its not in my bag and if Im not carrying it in the front right my pen light and pen go there and if I am they go in my backpack.Ill improve otherwise as my penlight can easily clip onto my backpack knife can go in my back pocket for a spell ect.,EDC,ck3oddz,1,t5_2reni

I actually carry the one in the picture since I like to see how different products wear over time. I currently have  cards in mine and could fit a decent amount more. The bigger gussets allow it to open further more depth but also take up a bit of the interior room as you mentioned when its half closed. So its a trade off. Last few I have made the gussets have been smaller so they take up less of the interior compartment and makes the wallet a bit slimmer.,EDC,ckshw8e,4,t5_2reni

2009292,0,t1_ckv9mqj,Well Id love to see a credible economist show the lowered costs this early in the ACAs lifespan. Frankly you cant state that a program works in its infancy. Hell who knows it could possibly be an amazing work of legislation when we look back on it. However it fundamentally is flawed in the fact that it attempts to stabilize the market through government interference. It needs to be reformed to allow more freedom to the citizen and to the business.As I said in another comment you are assuming that the U.S. has a free market economy when it doesnt. It has a mixed economy. The mixed economy is really tricky because it creates such a massive gray area. You and I can agree that based on Lockean theory all citizens are granted the right to life. A free market economy like Robert Nozicks would say that this means that they have the right to not be murdered. Marxist theory says that they have the right to have all of their needs met by the state. Is there no middle ground? Of course there is but we cant seem to agree on where that middle ground is.So please dont call me a moron because I believe that I have the right to the products of my labor even if it disagrees with your beliefs.

2186255,0,t1_clhp9h6,Man it is the best knife you will ever have. They made three sizes in that series they all look nearly the same Largest in descending order are First Responder and the Investigator Steve Tarani the designer of these knives is crazy. Hes a edged weapons expert and an instructor for multiple Federal Law Enforcement agencies. The steel used in the First Responder SV is commonly used in fixed blades. When he designed it he jammed that knife in one of those metal shipping containers used on semis and trains and barges and jumped on it to make sure the blade or lock didnt fail. It didnt. My Dad owns one of each of the  with a backup TenEight and I own a TenEight and a backup. And any time we find one for sale we pick it up right away.TLDR I love it. It is fucking incredible. IF you can find one of the knives in this series pick one up ASAP. They are discontinued and are nearly impossible to find. They are pricey but way worth it.EDIT Apparently Im a dickbag when it comes to steel usage in pocket knives. My apologies.,EDC,clhq5bt,2,t5_2reni

2228232,0,t1_cln0b99,Not the OP but why do you think an unclipped knife is likely to fall out?  Ive carried unclipped many times without issue just like I carry my cell phone or keys or carmex or whatever.  Things dont normally just fall out of pockets unless you work as a trapeze artist or something.  In fact its pretty easy to get your clip caught on random stuff you brush against maybe pulling it out of your pocket in the process so maybe carrying unclipped is more secure.Personally Ive only lost one knife my entire life and it was pocket clipped.,EDC,cln27y7,2,t5_2reni

Feels pretty durable though  it certainly hasnt scuffed or stained in that time and I did accidentally dump a jug of water on it today with no harm done or leaks!.My impressions so far mirror this Carryology review minus the lowlights as this is the updated but not the most recent redeisgn version with more secure straps and better leather lash points. It doesnt feel like its going to fall apart any time soon and those giant zippers have spoiled me on any other bag. Also the laptop sleeve runs high enough so that a Macbook Air feels well protected too.My one bugbear is that it could do with a sternum strap when carrying heavier loads. Topo sell an optional one but it feels like it should come as standard.,EDC,cloo40n,2,t5_2reni

2328393,0,t1_clzf5ey,Not OP but I will give you my reasoning. It was more affordable than say something like a Sig or a Glock but nicer than others. It seemed like a good entry level sidearm for me at the time. I also like how it had the two safeties but most importantly the firing pin indicator and the chambered round indicator. For a noob it gave me a little more comfort. In hindsight I might have done some things differently but I can say that I love that gun for what its worth. I have put well over  rounds through it and never had a FTF or similar. Its a little squirrely in the  sub compact version but thats likely my stancegrip and not its fault.

2750129,0,t3_2rkf6w,I recently bought a . rush  pack so I would be able to carry all my stuff with me to work and back and on my days off in case I was called into work. I realized thats not really what I wanted... The bag is really nice just too large for me to EDC in my opinion. I will stick with my sd. Instead Ive decided to set up these little kits to leave in my two vehicles so I can cut down on some of the things I carry in my pack like the civilian clothes and less cables it really does free up space and takes off the weight. Now my sd only has the essentials I need daily and in case I get stuck at work for an extended shift or the base closes down for some reason and I will always have these kits in my two cars in case I need anything in them any other time. Best of both worlds. Its amazing what you can pack in these small MOLLE pouches and they still have such a small footprint. It will work great for my Dodge Dart because it has the underseat storage in the front passenger seat. Ive also decided to quit carrying my pack with me on my days off because its been a while since Ive had to do overtime without having at least a few hours notice so Im pretty much always able to come back home and get ready. Its kind of a drag to carry everything around all the time. I purchased a maxpedition micro organizer to carry on my days off to store my extra vape charging cables small bottle of e liquid and few other things I use daily that I used from my pack. Those were really the only things I would use from them daily. No point in carrying a liter pack for a few small items. Thanks to rEDC I think I have minimized my EDC setup and will start to carry smarter. Now I just hope I dont get called into work on short notice when Im an hour away from home with no work clothes lolThe pouch contains black tshirt pair of socks pair of underwear feminine hygiene product hair tie micro usb cable lightning cable usb port charger iclear  tank small band aids PNY mah  external battery  food bar daynight of meds small bottle of mouthwash,EDC,cngof73,1,t5_2reni

I also do technical theaterstage crew most days after school so I use them both constantlycutting ropes opening stage lights to repair holding something to solder. When Im out camping fishing or hunting thats a different story and Im sure you can imagine all of the uses that  I would have but thats not my EVERY day carryas much as I wish I could go fishing every day. Ultimately most teenagers dont NEED to carry knives or multitools. It just comes down to what you want.

4660921,0,t1_cthtvr4,I was given the st Surface Pro by my employer. The main reason I cant get into it is because of the weight distribution. Its all on the back. Its top heavy and tipsy. The keyboard has no weight. This makes it almost impossible to use on your lap like I typically use a laptop onthegocouch or when Im not at a desk. When it comes to needing something to sit on your lap and type away at nothing beats a ThinkPad.With that said I try to look at what purposes the Surface can succeed at and all I can come up with is that it has a nice screen and accurate digitizer pen. I could see it great for people who draw or maybe take written notes. I dont do either of those things and if I have to hand write notes Id rather use paper.A typical Android tablet or iPad is lighter weight than the surface and does a better job at lightduty tablet tasks such as content consumption. The surface tries to do everything but does most things poorly. Id rather have a laptop and tablet for their separate purposes each of which will do their job well and are both affordable for the price of a Surface Pro. ThinkPad X series with a  screen isnt much bigger or heavier I think the Carbon is lighter yet feels much more solid in the hand and stable in the lap. Also has the best quality keyboards style vary by generation ever seen on a laptop.Seriously put a Surface on your lap and try to type on it Fail. Hold it in one hand and try to type in the other Fail. Count the seconds it takes to go from folded carrying to typing You have to hold it a certain way to unfold the keyboard adjust hands flip the back kickstand down adjust hands again then set down on table Fail.I think they call it a Surface because the only way to use it is to set it down on another surface.,EDC,cti2d8s,2,t5_2reni

Some people are more comfortable and accurate with revolvers others semi It really is personal preference. For me even though i love revolvers i prefer semi autos for self defense simply because of ammo capacity. Handguns despite what the film industry portrays are quite low powered I think the statistic is  of people shot with them survive or something of the like.

Do you chase after them or try and save your friend?  Just carry a bag if you need to.

Its really well done the fit and finish is perfect there are no hotshots on the hadle its perfectly sized for my uses and the recurve keeps the meat of the cut while the tip absolutely glides through anything. The hidden parts are really nice too the lock bar stabilizer and the clip screws are internal. Its a ceramic ball bearing and you can tell. The weight of the blade will close it the second you disengage the lock. Its as smooth as butter even when gunked up. Its really easy to take apart and there isnt any need for fiddling with it. The list goes on... but I love mine. Not afraid to use it either. Its really amazing at opening boxes and tape gunk doesnt stick to the cnc mill lines as much as I thought it would.

5199712,0,t3_3m7411,Seems like you got a good answer to your first question. Ill add one other thing that might not have been mentioned. The nd amendment and the Heller and McDonald rulings among others that proved that the right applies to individuals are almost unique in the modern world. Nowhere else are the peoples instruments of rebellion and insurrection against an oppressive government explicitly protected by that government. Its a point of pride for me as an American that I am allowed such liberties. So II exercise that right amongst others obviously partially just because I can. gt Abother question! Dont people notice that you have a gun strapped to you? Does that every affect social interactions?Not really. People are generally oblivious to others and their surroundings. Where I live youre not required to inform LEOs that youre carrying unless they ask. Ive had long conversations with police without them noticing. And theyre trained to specifically look for that and to cultivate a healthy skeptical mistrust of basically everybody. Normal people just arent looking. Heck I look....and either very few people in my city carry or Im bad at seeing them.

They cut things well and the lack of a locking mechanism never bothered me I just never used more than one of the multiple blades at a time. For a similar size and weight I could have a SAK and get five times the functionality with the extra tools. I have also moved away from the dedicated tactical folder category in favor of SAKs and multitools.

6526388,0,t1_czud7d5,Its not really a big deal at this point  Its been  years since I had my eye removed. The first few times was a little tricky. They make a little suction cup thing you can use to grab a hold of it but I havent used one in years. I have one around here somewhere....Now I just grab the edges and pull it out. Putting it back in is a little more tricky but not hard once you get the hang of it. Just pull your upper eyelid out a bit put the prosthetic under it then hold it in place and pull the lower lid down until it goes back into place. Some prosthetic eyes have a post on the back of them that allows for better movement  not sure whats involved in those but I imagine it wouldnt be much more difficult. I get it professionally polished about once a year. Otherwise I rarely have to take it out or clean it. The only time I really need to remove it is if I somehow get something behind it or I have occasionally irritated my eye socket by rubbing my eye in my sleep or something,EDC,czudpnx,8,t5_2reni

6649715,0,t1_d02j3ow,See my post above. I do agree with what you are saying but there are situations where you will think that a folder is faster because it snags less on thick clothing.Say youre wearing a decently long peacoat its probably winter because you needed to be warm you even have gloves on. If the cray cray attackermight even be a dog is just pulling on it you might not get enough up movement clearance to just have enough room to pull up on your fix blade to clear the sheath if youre carrying it IWB. Even cops had trouble deploying stuff from iwb a lot were taught yo just drop a bit their bodyweight center down to give the gun a bit more extra room to clear the holstersheath. Grabbing something pocket clipped from your pocket seam it might be actually slightly faster in that scenario.Also in case of some folders they either have a flipper which acts as a guard if it does accidentally close it might hit your index finger and Not actually cut you. Same thing for a finger choil the finger choil might hit your index finger. But what if you dont have a finger choil??? Well theres always the option of EDCing a decently large stylish index finger ring which might protect from a cut but not all the way. Another thing you might not have thought you needed for edc right? Damn rings haha take care.,EDC,d074zda,1,t5_2reni

Automotive glass is surprisingly difficult to break. The whole point of a designated glass breaker is to apply a lot of force on a tiny point that is much harder than the glass. Google provided this pretty decent explanation  I would say that what I would do personally is get a solid knife with a glass breaker on it Benchmade has a few I believe or a dedicated rescue tool like a  Resqme I have several and like them. Then carry which ever multitool you like. I also dont think that a multitool glass breaker would be  reliable. Dont get me wrong I love my multitools and theres a ton of things they can do well...

They happen to be the most important ones to match but there are  others that are also important to match to prevent a transfusion reaction. So if someone needed a transfusion emergently it makes the most sense to just start with something you can give to everyone no matter what. At the same time the lab is checking to see which of the units of blood they have on hand is the best match for the patient not only ABO and Rh but all the other minor blood groups too. Its not that we mistrust either your word or the patch it just doesnt make sense to risk a lifethreatening transfusion reaction when there is really no need to. ,EDC,d1q81g6,4,t5_2reni

Within ten yards I can do the same thing inside the  ring with most shots landing in the X ring. The gun just works for me.

7721163,0,t1_d3j2dpq,While helping a friend who had recently started EDCing a knife repair a house I had to remind her several times when it was applicable to some task you have a knife. I think its something you tend to overlook when youre not used to it.I mostly use knives to open packaging but sometimes to reshape various objects that could just be shaped better. I could get away without one most days but life is just better with one.Also having grown up in Alaska I have an ingrained belief that if I leave the house without a knife a light and a way to make fire I will probably die.,EDC,d3judgq,3,t5_2reni
7721803,0,t1_d3hpetk,Im a huge Opinel fangirl now. Totally hooked. I just bought another one to put in the emergency bag in my car trunk. Id recommend Opinel to pretty much anyonethe lock is solid the weight is great the blade gets and stays sharp theyre customizable with some sandpaper and patience and the low price is just a bonus.I dont feel its fragile. I used to use it mainly for food when out of the house but lately Ive been using it for whittling on more Opinels!. I feel like I could hack a branch off a tree with it if I needed to. Yes the blade is thin compared to some other knives. But I think traditionally they were like countryside knives for farmers and shit in the s so they are supposed to hold up well enough to heavier or outdoor types of use. Heres pictures and descriptions from a guy who batons with an Opinel No. The one downside of Opinel is that if you dunk the handles in water the wood can swell until its dried out properly. So theyre maybe not for people who plan to be soaking wet a lot.

8654092,0,t1_d6ncpqm,As someone whos EDCd a Benchmade Mini Grip with partially serrated blade for nearly  years Im ready to move on to a straight blade. The area that is serrated the lower  is really the working part of a knife. If youre carving or cutting anything of substance that lower third is the area that really gives you control over what youre doing. When that area is wasted on serrations its just going to cut all jagged at best. People claim serrations are great for fiber but a sharp straight blade is just as good and easier to achieve than a sharp serrated as you noted. Besides I dont cut much fiber if I did Id carry a fully serrated blade just for that. Serrations hold their sharpness longer than straight blades because theres more surface area to take the wear and tear of each cut this is the actual only true benefit that Im aware of in serrations.My knife has basically become a glorified package opener since its useless at anything requiring proper cutting. Which is why Im switching to carrying a Gerber EAB for boxes tape etc and an Opinel No.  for food proper cutting and delicate tasks. Hope this helps!,EDC,d6ndjj4,6,t5_2reni

It was created with the idea in mind held just as high that no tyranny should exist be it of the minority or the majority. Its perfectly fine if you dont like guns. What does not become fine is that because you dont like them you stop others from trying to or owning carrying them as well. You are either for all civil liberties or you are not.

I would wager knife violence is higher than gun violence almost everywhere. Easier to use easier to acquire. Theyre pretty much everywhere. Its not about the weapon its about intent. I could carry around a pen and kill people with it. Theyre not going to take away my pen. Hell military trained personel could potentially do more damage quicker with their bare hands than any civilian armed with gun. What is your ideal world? No one has access to a gun? At all? So the only people with them are those that have stolen them? That sounds like a terrible situation. What about all guns in the world are destroyed and they stop being made. Would that be enough? Theyd find other means. Perhaps death by knives would make a rise. Do we then ban all the knives? People could make their own. Sad reality or not. Its reality. You can try to change the world to be safer or you can arm yourselves with the means to defend yourself in it. I live in Canada. I have only handled guns at firing ranges. But if someone comes at me with a gun Im going to do my very best to try to kill them. Because their intent was lethal. And I think I am far more willing to take their life than they are mine. I dont carry anything for self defense but many tools can make good improvised weapons. The reality is the world is dangerous. At any moment someone can decide they want to kill you and attempt to do so. If someone broke into your house right now how would that go? Hopefully that never happens.

If you only care about gun homicides then you dont really care about safety.gtThat statement doesnt declare that guns arent a problem it only declares that the current draconian gun laws are ineffective. That is a large difference from what you are stipulating.I never stipulated anything. You are arguing a strawman. I dont think gun laws make society safer.gtFurthermore I have the largest issue with your stipulation there is more evidence. Do you know this for a fact? Have you read a meta analysis of recent gun studies that makes this conclusion? Could you link it to me please? Id be happy to eat my words I am a reasonable person. I love it when a more advanced or better study comes out in a journal that contradicts my research it gives me the opportunity to learn.I have posted  studies and you have posted none. Further more there are many countries with more gun laws and less gun than the US that have more homicide. Their gun control didnt make them safer.gtThe only assertion I really made was that people are getting shot and its a problem.Its not really a problem and you also asserted that its on gun owners to fix it.gt They are Americans like you and I and the law should protect them like you and I.I dont believe in collectivism. it is really only ever used to fulfill one small groups agenda under the guise of being good for everyone.

People end up getting killed because of negligence or malice involving cars all the same and I find it hard to believe that the victims are at all comforted by the fact that oh at least it wasnt designed to kill me. Does the fact that the truck wasnt designed to kill change the fact that one was used to kill  people in Nice? If the best youve got is arguing over the philosophical designed purpose of an object rather than how theyre actually used and what their actual effect is in reality then youve truly lost sight of what this is all about the fact that peoples lives are at play.If you seriously think for a second that somehow pointing out that something that precisely as you pointed out arent even designed to kill managed to kill far more people than these guns that were all supposed to be scared of because of how dangerous they are is somehow taking killing lightly youre being disingenuous or obtuse.,EDC,d9qs3gl,2,t5_2reni

Having six therefore means the LED is being driven at .A. Six is the usual recommendation because its a good balance between heat brightness and battery life. The reason its in the body color section because AliExpress doesnt seem to allow custom fields.Second the usual emitter recommended is the T B due to its neutral color K which is close to that of noonday sun.I have two S lights with eight driver chips.

Having a second magazine gives me both a more rounds if I need to use my firearm in self defense and b the ability to correct the situation if the firearm jams. I dont know how much you know about firearms so I apologize if you already know this but some jams can be fixed without removing the magazine and some need the magazine to be removed to clear.The smaller mag doesnt take up too much space in my pocket so I dont mind tossing it in along with my multitool and keys.

10340225,0,t3_5o2aje,Pictured Regular EDCLux Pro LP Flashlight  I love this flashlight. Its big enough to throw its  lumens nice and wide telescopes for a tighter beam and has an end button. My only mod will be taking a lathe to the tail end to make the button proud. Fits well in my back pocket. Used daily or more since I got it for Christmas and is still on the batteries it came with.iPhone  gb  This is a handmedown. Already two years old it has served its time and is still serving me well. I expect it to continue to serve me well for the next year until I get upgraded to a new android.Kershaw Brawler Knife  This is my second one of these knives. I absolutely love them. This is not my second because of any kind of failure but because I lost the first. It can easily be sharpened sharp enough to take off arm hair which is how I keep it. Its the perfect size to clip onto your pocket and not be felt and the assisted open is awesome. I use this multiple times daily.Alpine Swiss Thin Wallet  I keep a few dollars student ID Drivers license debit card and credit card in it. For the last couple months it has also had a prepaid debit card as well as my old expired debit card. It has been in my EDC for two years now and continues to serve me well. I love how thin it is even with everything in it. I will be removing the old debit card and prepaid card soon which will make it that much thinner.The Keys!  A bottle openermultitool which says Night Ize on the side. Handy for prying and such. Chip on the end is from being hit with a lawn mower. Also on the keychain is a key to a  Chevy Silverado Z New Body two tool box keys just realized that box isnt in the truck right now pad lock key for the  ton jack in my pickup bed very old masterlock key office key I work part time as a child mentor spark plug gapper  Wendys frosty tag  Wendys frosty tag Harbor Freight tag and my dorm room key.Woolrich Hat  I wear this any time I would wear a jacket or coat whether it be because of cold or because of precipitation. This originally belonged to the now deceased grandfather of a very close friend of mine. I inherited much of his grandfathers dress clothes and hats because unlike my friend I shared a frighteningly similar build to his grandfather.And finally the skateboard  The setup is an  Superior deck with Jessup grip angled silver trucks pics below Spitfire Cheapshots bearings and mm duro Cadillac Wheels. This is my commuter board. The deck and bearings are both brand new within the past couple weeks. The trucks are angled both to accommodate the larger wheels without wheel bite and also to allow me to turn tighter. The setup is a little heavy but is a good size for me and rolls very well on rough roads and sidewalks which is much of what I ride on. Im also not shy about getting it wet from riding in the rain. I typically urethane my decks though this one hasnt been yet. Anywhere that the urethane wears off I just coat with vegetable oil every so often. This makes my decks last quite a lot longer than they typically would when ridden in the rain. Frankly I dont like this graphic nearly as much as the last which was the Superior . with the floral pattern.Image of trucks angled and wheelsNot Pictured I totally forgot to include my Fitbit Charge . Its on a  stainless steel magnetic wristband I got on Amazon. Added a little weight but really much nicer than the band that came on it.Extended EDC year old Oakley Backpack  Modified to fit a penny board on the back grommets and rope this backpack has been through it. From me being thrown from the hood of a car and sliding through the gravel and mud on my back to me eating it on my skateboard and rollingsliding onto my back while containing my laptophard drivescamera it has served me well and will continue to. When it starts to get bad I will most likely mend it or have it mended instead of replacing it. I have yet to find one that I like nearly as well even made by Oakley. It is just a basic single pocket backpack without even a laptop sleeve inside with one small pocket on each side.USB Portable Battery  Just a cheap chinese eBay unit. I actually like it better than most because it is in a metal case and has a button on it which turns on and off an LED which allows it to be used as a flashlight. Hasnt failed me yet.Magic the Gathering BlackGreen Deck  This is my favorite deck. I am a pretty cheap player only ever spent about  cumulative on the game but this deck was put together with extra cards I had and will beat a lot of my friends  decks. Also pictures are my dice.Bluetooth OBDII Scanner  This is just a cheap  amazon piece that works with any android phone. I seem to have forgotten my old Samsung Galaxy S at school that I typically use it with. Been a solid worker for almost two years now.Asus NJKDST Laptop  About two years old now this has been a great laptop. It runs pretty much anything I throw at it very well has an HD touch screen which is beautiful and is very tough in its anodized aluminum casing. This is the laptop that was in my backpack when I ate asphalt on my skateboard. The casing is dented and scratched but this machine just keeps ticking. Ive only had two problems out of it since I had it First I had to replace the wifi card after the skateboard accident.  later I was perfectly back in business. Second the AUX port it awful. Mine mostly stopped working. I have since switched to using a USB to AUX adapter which Im actually going to integrate into the internals and add new ports on the side of the laptop which will also add a mic port which it didnt have from the get go. I have made two modifications to the laptop. One was to upgrade to a gb SSD and move the HDD to the CDDVD tray using an adapter. The other was to double my ram which now puts me at gb. It is also currently running Windows . It came with Windows  which was immediately replaced with Windows  but I upgraded when Win  came out. I have also dual booted Ubuntu  on it and I plan to again.Zune   Ive had this thing since new and it is still kicking. Great piece of hardware lovingly nicknamed The Brick. Its not always carried since I now have Pandora and Amazon Prime on my phone but it is still used relatively often in the vehicle.Panasonic Ear Buds  Not sure exactly what model but I paid I think  for them on Amazon. Theyve been really good little earbuds. Pretty solid sound for earbuds and they stay in my ears plenty well.Wireless Mouse  This is just a cheap generic light up wireless gaming mouse I found on eBay first. Ive probably had  of them not because they break well one did but because I lose them or keep a couple extras around different places. Very ergonomic and I like the forwardback buttons at the thumb.Nokia Lumia   I loved this little phone. Great and super tough hardware. The back of the phone was practically a case. I actually really loved the software too but ultimately had to switch over to the second hand iPhone because of the lack of Snapchat and recent removal of Amazon from the store. I hope that a Surface phone is released and that they can get more widespread app support for it.Sketch Pad  for notes drawings ideas etc.Canon Rebel SL  The smallest DSLR on the market and the cheapest with continuous autofocus for video. Shoots mp images in JPG RAW or both and shoots p video. Has a touch screen and I did have a small Rode mic on it which I need to repair and put back on. The mount broke but the mic itself is fine. I currently have an adapter on it for a Pentax screw mount lens and a mm prime lens installed which was given to me. Great little camera and I am really enjoying the lens.Ray Ban Glasses  These are my perscription glasses. Nikon transition lenses with all of the scratch resistance and everything that I could get. Theyve still been scratched some. I only carry them sometimes because its a pretty minor perscription. Mostly when Im going to be doing metalworking.EpiPen  Im allergic to bees. This is important.USB power brick  I also typically carry both micro USB and lighting cables with me but for some reason they werent in my bag.Speed Stick  My deodorant of choice. Pro tip its cheaper per ounce to get the double pack of small sticks than the larger single stick at WalMart.Blistex  Honestly the girlfriend uses it more than I do. Nice to have once in a while though.Generic FloNase  Hello Seasonal AllergiesNot Pictured Prilosec  The heart burn is real.Probable New EDC EditionsiPad  gb  This one has been around the block a few times and is starting to show its age with dents and scratches but the screen is intact and it functions fairly well. I may make it a dedicated Netflix device and carry it but it will likely stop being carried again within a couple weeks just like the last  times.Memo Pad  Honestly could be very helpful. I am pretty much in constant need of one.Pilot G  The classic. I used to carry one all the time but for some reason it has fallen out of rotation.Old Acer Netbook with extra battery  Could be handy sometimes whether it be for setting up a temporary server or for allowing someone to use a computer. Will likely run Ubuntu.If you all have any questions let me know!,EDC,dcg4g8u,4,t5_2reni

11047890,0,t1_dek72ji,Not really actually! I was unsure at first but it is definitely a good one to carry. I got this after searching for a knife to carry everyday so this was the first of the  knives in the picture that would become my EDC knives. I usually just push it off to the side in my pocket and it fits comfortably there. ESEE has great products and this is no different. I like how small it is because its perfect for carrying in your pocket like I do. It might be a bit odd to get used to at first but I have no real issue with it. Its very handy and useful and I would definitely recommend it for anyone considering acquiring a smaller EDC knife. Part of me wishes that I had a different sheath for it but it really doesnt need it. Its nice and small and fits in my pocket with ease. The paracord handle in my opinion is almost needed at least for me. The handle is thin on its own which is nice for pocket carry but that also makes it hard to get a grip in order to take the knife out of the sheath. This might not be as big of an issue for those with smaller hands but I would say a handle of some kind is definitely well worth it. I havent had to resharpen it yet but I would like to soon. Overall its a great knife and I would recommend holding one and checking it out for yourself at the least. ,EDC,dek9cik,1,t5_2reni

It seems like she did exactly the right thing in getting to a safe place without escalating the situation. With regards to the law where would you stand if for example you are the driver who is being harrassed and you had shown your gun they had drawn theirs and you were forced to shoot them? In my eyes you have instigated the escalation of that confrontation. They can claim to be acting in self defense in raising their weapon and you are then the aggressor not the defender.If you are in a car the reasonable and proportionate response would not be to draw a gun on someone who is harassing you it would be to do as your wife did and get to a safe place breaking the rule of the road if necessary.,EDC,df02owc,5,t5_2reni

11268423,0,t1_df8hpnl,Id use isopropyl alcohol whatever percentage you can get your hands on to clean the bearing. Just apply it directly to the bearing and spin the spinner. Use canned compressed air to dry or better yet a hair dryer to avoid condensation. Soap and water also works great. I often do both and soap and water leads to better spin times in my experience. You can use lube if you want itll make the spin quieter but youre right that it decreases spin times Id keep it dry if youre looking for a long spin time.,EDC,df99c1j,1,t5_2reni
