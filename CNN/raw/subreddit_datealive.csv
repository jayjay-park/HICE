4966128,0,t3_3ix0cw,Hmm... I would recommend Kore wa zombie desu ka? Is this a Zombie its a nice good harem anime. Way funnier and enjoyable than Date A Live to be honest. Just watch the episode  beginning scene youd laugh uncontrollably lol.Next would be Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai The World Only God Knows is very similar to Date A Live. Except the main character of this show is an otaku and his mission is to capture girls with kisses well basically Shido with an otaku personality. I mean he got an adopted sibling like Kotori who helped his mission so basically Shido with way different personality.Oh this one is also funny. Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru Noucome. The main character have this curse where he have to make a choice and he cant deny the Absolute Order. Almost the same way on how Kotori and Fraxinus ordered Shido around when he is dating except more painful. A very fun harem anime.Here are some of the links for you to check my recommendation ,datealive,cukiov9,4,t5_2z8yl

7042448,0,t1_d1elktf,I do agree with you that Bryn Apprill does a good job. I admit that I prefer the English dub a little over the Japanese. Heck... I think that the delivery of the dub better helps the comedy of Date A Live.,datealive,d1ema6q,2,t5_2z8yl
