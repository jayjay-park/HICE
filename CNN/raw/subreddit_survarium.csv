2411280,0,t3_2n1xiq,IMO I think its good that one of the starting weapons is a solid choice even in later stages of the game especially in a free to play game. If you look at the dps of the PPSHKiparis youll see that they compare pretty well to the AKu AKM etc. Of course you sacrifice a little accuracy range and armor penetration but theyre still pretty comparable. The other reason simply might be that the players using them were just broke and couldnt afford ammo or their main gun that they use was in the middle of being repaired. Who knows.,survarium,cm9qrdx,2,t5_2tzb2
