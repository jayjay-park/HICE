4462564,1,t3_3c4h5y,TOMBSTONE IS OP! NERF IT! NERF IT!!!!!! If he wanted to he could have ended the fight in just five seconds. There is just no strategy there. Just shred and next opponent. The other fights had something more interesting to watch.Sorry that is just my gamer drive telling me something is just too unfair.,BattleBotsRaw,cst6o9w,0,t5_38ym3
4465961,0,t1_cstlpa2,Tombstone seems to be the tourney favorite but I like Bronco to win it all that flipper is crazy strong and its so solidly built. ,BattleBotsRaw,cstm0tg,14,t5_38ym3
4471690,0,t1_csu050d,The tested videos they released online were really cool couple of the builders were talking about how for example they had to switch motors last minute and what the implications were on the design. Unfortunately ABC has zero faith in its audiences intelligence so well get like five seconds of that for every twenty minutes of reality show bs on the actual show,BattleBotsRaw,csubvu0,2,t5_38ym3
