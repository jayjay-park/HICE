330525,0,t3_1xlcr9,I used to hate avocados as well. Turns out I just prefer Californian over the Florida variety. I guess that means more for the rest of us and you have no problem getting the sofritas at Chipotle.It seems the cardinal sin of veganism is to hate hummus avocados and nutritional yeast. ,vegproblems,cff139z,3,t5_2t2ag
334051,0,t1_cff76uz,I tend to think of foods in their vegan versions. Ill think I want a latte not I want a soy latte or I want a taco not I want a bean tacoIt definitely depends on the waiter. I tend to frequent restaurants on retro row in my city where even if they arent vegan theyre vegan friendly. At the very least it couldnt hurt to ask.,vegproblems,cffe7yt,2,t5_2t2ag
339886,0,t3_1x3wvv,It was awkward and weird for me to at first but after a few years of incorporating it in my meals I have become addicted to the stuff.  Also it is nice to get it for the price of polenta. around  bucks for a pound,vegproblems,cffzzic,3,t5_2t2ag

1485005,0,t1_cj2105l,Maybe say why you dont want those spring rolls? They might feel like giving free complimentary items is always nice but if they know you dont like them because you do not eat meat they might remove them. Or if they have vegetarian spring rolls on the menu ask if they could include those instead...,vegproblems,cj2f5dk,8,t5_2t2ag

2208082,0,t1_clkh3bk,I think the spoon went with the tofu tray to be cleaned.  Unfortunately the chicken still didnt have a spoon which means the problem could have perpetuated.  I dont think they do the cilantro tofu at our Whole Foods.  My husband hates cilantro and he is already frustrated with how many of the tofu dishes have cilantro.  At our Whole Foods they have a nonvegan tofu dish that I really want them to make vegan.  Ive asked but today I was told that they have to stick to the recipes that are used throughout the region. Ive never been for breakfast but we go almost weekly for lunch.  The local Whole Foods has a taco truck with vegan tacos as well and I often go there instead of to the salad bar.,vegproblems,clki1zb,1,t5_2t2ag
2636658,0,t1_cn11yj2,I think a better analogy to veganism in the way that the founders of the term define it would be like people who refuse to travel to countries with severe human rights violations and give them tourist money. For example many people do not wish to give North Korea tourist dollars so they do not visit that country. There are many viable alternative countries that will provide beauty joy and diversity to your life that will not support heartless regimes. To value your own taste preferences over the lives and well beings of others is quite selfish when so many viable alternatives exist.,vegproblems,cn2qsyf,15,t5_2t2ag

8603793,0,t1_d6h1bpi,Yeah that and its one of those selffulfilling things. If someone doesnt tell you theyre vegan then youre never going to know so you may meet many people who are vegan and not realise. The only way you find out if someone is vegan is if they tell you so it seems like all the vegans youve met have told you that theyre vegan.But yeah I dont really talk about it at work because theres no real need to then today we were supposed to be trying to meet certain targets to win prizes and every single one was either milk chocolate or gelatine sweets.
