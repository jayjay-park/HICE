2321038,0,t3_2ludug,First off its a temporary revival drink. It lasts until you log off. Also getting revived permanently isnt that hard anymore since Nisovin just mass revived at spawn and Queen Shay will revive you if you ask her nicely. Secondly its not that rare of an item. It may be new yes but the bar owner will probably continue to give more out when she comes on. Right now there are not many of her special drinks on the market but thats subject to change. For now assuming no more stock comes out I would put the price around  bars.,LoMTrading,clylehn,3,t5_33sde
