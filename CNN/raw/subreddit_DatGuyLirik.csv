I personally enjoy SubSunday but I do understand that it breaks up his normal routine which is a bigger problem than the games that are played.There will always be hate for specific games especially for as many as Lirik plays but if he could integrate upvoted games into his normal block schedule a couple times out of the week instead of dedicating an entire day it would give him more flexibility and not limit exposure to new awesome games AND it lets viewers look forward to his more standard content.

In theory we should all be able to do this but alas its easier said than done for many of us. Edited to add I was actually laughing tears whilst watching this. Sadly I was watching the Vod because this was one time I really wished I could see chat and the reactions. How Lirik remained composed at all with that character he created Ill never know.

5310683,0,t3_3npmhb,Ill leave the comment I made in rNRDFUSION before the thread got removed.gt It seems like every other month he takes like  days off to go to various conventions. Now dont get me wrong everyone needs a break Im not giving him shit for that. Im certainly not one of those viewers that demand him to stream nonstop like a performing monkey. But it is disappointing and I only mean that because Im such a big fan of his.gt Lately it just seems like hes totally disinterested in Twitch or playing games like he used to. I like the night streams but only so many before they become repetitive. He doesnt interact that much with chat anymore. Hes constantly looking down at his phone texting. He then shouts at and berates chat for asking him not to text Which Im a bit meh about chat telling him to do stuff in the beginning. His reluctance to go to the NRDFUSION studios is worrisome.I dont know. I just miss the geekynerdyMinecraft Waffle  I know its selfish of me.,DatGuyLirik,cvqi29p,33,t5_2yrza

8752005,0,t3_4zgwkw,Gf and new schedule but is anyone even surprised.  Ive been watching lirik and waffle for  years now and at first they way lirik acted was funnycool.  Now I see him as a dick to his friends and needs to be more considerate but I mean isnt that why we watch him at the same time for his humor style.  Lirik is actually the unreliable one for night streams they only happen when he wants them.  My real guess is that waffle got tired of including his night steam in his schedule and just decided to move on.A perfect example would be when waffle invited dizzykitten and lirik was giving that mood like he didnt want her there even though he treated her nice. If you were following dizzy then you saw her stream where she pretty much figured she would become a regular and changed her streaming schedule to fit the nightstreams. What did lirik do?  For some reason and Im guessing he didnt like dizzy around he stopped doing night streams for a while and it fked up dizzys schedule since she thought she was gonna be a regular and so she had to end up going back to her old schedule when it was clear that lirik didnt want her there.  Then she stopped coming to his channel all together as a regular and lirik started night streams again.  Dont get me wrong lirik is still my fav streamer but he has a very entitled personality and Im guessing waffle finally decided to stop counting on daily nightstreams.,DatGuyLirik,d6znome,2,t5_2yrza

Just like him spending his birthday with his mom was a load of shit.Im not sure why he keeps trying to be mysterious about it. We already know who she is. His comment about seasonal depression is frankly insulting to people who truly suffer from it.,DatGuyLirik,d9fhb23,61,t5_2yrza
9467846,0,t1_d9fnsu2,Well its probably that he wake up or realized that he dont feel to stream. You cant plan this like  day before the stream.. If he like  hours before stream feel he dont want to stream he wont streaming or you want boring angry lirik who not enjoing anything on stream ? ,DatGuyLirik,d9g476m,2,t5_2yrza
9752545,1,t1_dacd2vq,Thats not exactly true. Waffle has a schedule and he streams a lot has constant viewer counts and stuff like that. If it works why not? This whole thing is business after all. Streaming at the same time like the big guys isnt really beneficial Tim and Cohn are both streaming way earlier than Lirik Shorty usually streams way longer than Lirik. At some point you just have to admit Twitch is still not about you. Everyone depends on money and you gotta live somehow. ,DatGuyLirik,daf7v5m,0,t5_2yrza

Youve got to run a stream like a business being able to watch all of his VODs for free has been really nice but if he went to subonly availability Id probably sub again to have access. I dont find it shameful Tim does it and Tim makes even more than LIRIK does. He already makes X isnt a good argument when it comes to trying to make more.,DatGuyLirik,dbcrok5,2,t5_2yrza

11766138,0,t1_dgth24y,I actually like the surfer dude his RP is great he really gets into his character and goes with the RP comparing him to Zoe is bad. Just because its their server and their rules doesnt mean I cant criticise at the same time Im not pushing anything on them whatever floats their boat. As for Zoe events are not really RP theyre shit honestly I wouldnt mind it if the server had like  people. But like I previously said events limit the RP especially when theres only  people on the server theres no situations not much character just a boring af bike ride with some small talk. Also I find their protectiveness of their rules rather stupid since only whitelisted people can enter I would get their strict behaviour if it was open but the guy didnt do anything wrong his RP was great and no one had a problem with it. Sometimes people have to look at the situation from a perspective of a human being not someone who has a stick up his ass.,DatGuyLirik,dgtq041,1,t5_2yrza
