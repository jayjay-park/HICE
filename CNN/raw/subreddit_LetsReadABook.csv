3789571,0,t1_cqk2teu,gtHowever the expense to being blinded by their passion and being taught how human they really are is the reason Krakauer even wrote the book. He admits early on that the accounts in the book may contain many inaccuracies as he couldnt write the book from lucid memories as his brain was depleted from oxygen when the events occurred...I didnt catch these important details on my reading so Im glad you mentioned this. I should think itll greatly color how Ill be interpreting the book going forward. Especially the latter statement will Krakauer be informing us when moments are fuzzy or will he be fleshing in details for dramatic effect? Either way the story has me going...,LetsReadABook,cqo8oy8,2,t5_36p9q
3910401,0,t1_cr1ywbp,I like to highlight the books Im reading especially if theres a particular phrase paragraph etc. that I liked. Some of the used books I have had markings in the margins but I liked reading what other people thought versus whatever my thoughts are. I never really took it as being drawn to someone elses thoughts affecting my own. ,LetsReadABook,cr20rfg,3,t5_36p9q

9318278,0,t3_56s2gv,II finally got to start the book! Im traveling right now so my opportunities to read are sporadic. But thanks to jet lag I read the first section of the book while laying in a hotel bed while my jet lagged baby crumpled up a pamphlet for an attraction I have no intention of visiting.Im definitely drawn in at this point. The story has my attention and I find myself comparing Hannahs experiences to my own. Obviously this fictional teenager is better able to articulate her discomfort and the reasons than most young girls would be able to. So it seems so far to be a dissection of the experience of sexism and sexual objectification of young girls. Since we already know she commits suicide we know the the jokes shes subjected to have a serious impact. But I have a hard time believing that someone so able to dissect her experience would not see the possibility of a light at the end of the tunnel. It does almost seem like the fantasy of the bullied to kill yourself and ensure the bullies are forced to confront their guilt.The writing style  alternating between two monologues  is a bit tricky for me. Its getting easier as I read but it slows me down since its not a smooth narrative.Also... why cassettes?,LetsReadABook,d8x5rjm,1,t5_36p9q
