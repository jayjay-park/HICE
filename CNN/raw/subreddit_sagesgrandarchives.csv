8010073,0,t3_4nir38,This is awesome! I would love to try and get involved in any way needed! I also think your whole idea would make an amazing DampD style indie game. But that may just be wishful thinking lol! Either way if there is anything I can do to help let me know!  ,sagesgrandarchives,d4geo3b,1,t5_3ep6n
11291019,0,t3_612xdf,Just as an additional minor note in exploring other crap I came across this. Subjectively to me it sounds like names like Lud and Zallen could be Welshish. This isnt that far of a stretch given names like Gwyn and Llewelyn. I havent been able to glean much from online translators  Welsh dictionaries though. Anyone know enough Welsh to comment?,sagesgrandarchives,dfbtjyk,1,t5_3ep6n
