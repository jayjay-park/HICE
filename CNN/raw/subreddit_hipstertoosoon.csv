Bowen s description of this scene is one of my favorites I ve ever read. Brut built them up into something they really weren t as Portia did with Eddie. He didn t have a lot else to grasp in a world that has passed him completely by. Sometimes what we hold onto to get by is tenuous at best.Not much more happens then this really and yet i find myself giving it four stars encouraging you to read it an Happy that few of us are aware of the world until we are already in league with it Not much more happens then this really and yet i find myself giving it four stars encouraging you to read it and then standing in the breach against all the rest of my bookclub chums here in Poole and say that i loved it in the face of their almost universal dislike of it or at least severe boredom. It is because Elizabeth Bowen has constructed a novel of quite heartbreaking simplicity. Portia the young girl is innocent and naive and thus Bowen would have us see supremely dangerous. She has none of the protective apathy of Anna her horribly selfish sisterinlaw none of the vicious disregard of some of the more worldly wise young people none of the selfabsorption and miraculously preserved lack of selfknowledge of her admired  none of the hard cynicism of Anna s writer friend and sadly none of the beaten down acceptance of the perenially ignored Major Brutt.She is what happened after Bloomsbury.. And although Bowen is really good at observing characters she is not very good at making them interact. You listen quietly or laugh low as shadows play on the drawing room walls. So Portia is set as a work in progress in amidst.Quentin a writer and frequent visitor to the Quaynes s home. One cannot fault them for their level of erudition or impressive command of English and French but their discussions at tea are desultory opaque and even worse duplicitous. Bowen has her characters thinking and reflecting and whereas some of these streams of consciousness type excerpts work well Matchett s extended soliliquy in the taxi towards the end of the novel being a good example I sometimes struggled to work out whether it was Portia or Elzabeth Bowen I was listening too. Disconcertingly vulnerable Portia is manifestly trying to understand what is going on around her and looking for something that is not there. It demonstrates how a jaded older woman can resent a young girl s innocence with inexplicable venom.Here in a superb sublime novel of manners etiquette Bowen takes out her artistic chisel and plies it ruthlessly into what is easily the most breathtaking vivisection of Great Britannia I have come across. But when Eddie follows Portia to a seaside resort the flash of a cigarette lighter in a darkened cinema illuminates a stunning romantic betrayaland sets in motion one of the most moving and desperate flights of the heart in modern literature. In this book place is home  the idea of home as sanctuary being another theme of this novel. In  she was made a Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature Elizabeth Bowen died in . She has a kind of snaky prose style that starts a sentence one place and ends it somewhere else but not in a way that baffles the reader only in a way that turns them pleasantly upsidedown..   ,hipstertoosoon,cx9bbcg,1,t5_2ttm2
