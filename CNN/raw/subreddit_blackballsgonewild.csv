6683293,0,t3_3kfu7v,Car Insurance Renewal?Dear Mates I have been driving for a yearThe car that I have got is Micra  litre. Just received a letter from my current Insurance Provider. Letter says that my car insurance is  for this year if I pays Monthly. Which is about  more than last year. Even this year I have got  year No Claim Bonus. What you guys think is that OK or is it too much on this car? How much do you pays at the moment? Many Thanks,blackballsgonewild,d0am072,1,t5_2uf5o
