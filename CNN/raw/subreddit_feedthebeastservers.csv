Started with FTB Mindcrack and worked my way to Unleashed and lastly Monster. Ive been playing off and on for over a year.. How much time do you estimate you might play per week? When? I work a lot but I spend way to much time playing video games on my days off. Um most likely  hours or so.. What do you like about a community run concept like this? Power to the people! Really I think its a neat way to meat others who enjoy playing modded mc with no griefing mutual respect and mature players.. Describe your gamestyle. Are you more technical aesthetic a bit of both? My gamestyle is simple build an elaborate system of tunnels underneath Razines base and steal his stuff when hes not looking. Srs. Im more of an aesthetic builder but I do enjoy dabblying in technical aspects. Isnt that what modded mc is all about? . Use this prompt to add any additional information you think helpful. I enjoy plagiarism. I mainly enjoy the multiplayer aspect of FTB. I am not afraid to jump on voice chat and work together to build awesome things. I have personally not ran a small FTB server for a few personal friends so I kinda understand where lag comes from and how to avoid it in my builds.
