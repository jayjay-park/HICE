6858111,0,t3_3uqv86,Hi everybody sorry my English is not perfectRespectfully I think this is a stupid question. Everyone can dance tango. The important thing is what and how it is taught. Because to learn to dance tango very well a good foundation is essential.The examples of Argentine dancers as Osvaldo Zotto Javier Rodriguez and Gabriel Misse are not valid because the average height of the Argentines is . mt ft. Are few the high dancers in Argentrina because the average is not very high.My height is . ft and I dance from  years with all kinds of women of course Im much more comfortable with tall women this is common sense. Although if the woman know dance with a tall man the dance can be a extasis. As well in my experience the usually men dont know to dance with tall womenPerhaps the discussion should be what are the qualities of high dancers. For me tall people get movements more stylized and elegant if you know how to dance of course.I invite you to watch a videos of me in my web sitie www.miescueladetango.com.arVIDEOSE.html,tango,d0toc5t,1,t5_2qjmq

9876513,0,t3_5bzr4q,Man here  I like my partner to put her left hand on my left shoulder. Thats right she puts her left arm over my shoulders with the left hand falling on my left shoulder. Since you are relatively tall I think that should be comfortable for both. This is for close embrace by the way.This hand placement is decidedly oldfashioned at this point  I learned in the late s and womans arm over the mans shoulders was standard practice. About  years ago the style changed but frankly the arm over the shoulders works so much better.,tango,dauxkym,1,t5_2qjmq
10214868,0,t3_5m59od,Ive had a similar experience lately also just over a year dancing tango as a follow. Ive come to recognize that experienced leaders in my community are in high demand especially when the milonga is followheavy and some will even need to take a  tanda break to save energy and keep up the quality of their dancing. I try to remind myself that their dance card is absolutely packed  and they are probably prioritizing follows theyve known for years. Theres no one reason why theyre not asking me to dance so I try to not take it personally and to focus on enjoying the dances I do get. I can sympathize that its a frustrating and sometimes isolating feeling. It sounds like youve made a good connection with your community  Ive cultivated friendships with several more experienced students from my group classes and this has been key in dealing with the loneliness aspect. Im more introverted so it is additionally helpful in discerning which interactions and non interactions with leaders are worth noting. Besides word travels and people can see your progress even if theyre not dancing with you  with time Im sure youll get those dances. Im patiently waiting on mine and in the meantime reconnecting with the reasons I started learning tango in the first place. ,tango,dc1wvov,7,t5_2qjmq
