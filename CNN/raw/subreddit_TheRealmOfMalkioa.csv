You Live In BROOKLYN? Tiptons Megan impulsively hooks up with Tellers Alec hostilities and misunderstandings ensue after the deed is done and shes looking to make a getaway but the getaways impossible because a blizzard has socked New York City and the nowresentful duo is snowed in. Michael Showalters TVscreen bit part as a wacky weatherman is broad but not undiverting. This is where the movie settles in and gets interesting as the two discern an opportunity for complete honesty in the current situation.When Daisy returns she finds a note that Megan had scribbled and she and Alec exchange the notes that they had found and they break up. At a New Year s Eve party Megan is arrested because the same note was found in Alec s neighbor s apartment which the two had broken into earlier. Alec arrives to the prison with flowers and balloons. He pays bail but Megan refuses to see him or even leave the holding cell. Later when her roommate comes to pay bail Alec apologizes saying that he didn t know her last name and that this was the only way he thought he could see her again.The characters are smart and funny but the story digs much deeper.It reminded me of comingofage stories from my youth. Nichols read the script which appeared on the Blacklist in December  and pitched his vision of the story to producers Beau Flynn Ruben Fleischer and Adam Yoelin. I was shooting a Willie Nelson video in Austin TX in May  and got a call that I was on board said Nichols. We immediately started casting the film and were lucky to have a lot of talented actors and actresses who were interested but there was something about Analeigh Tipton s Megan that caught my attention. Nichols said it was essential that her characters date Alec understand that hes never met a girl like her and cant let her go. Miles Teller joined the cast soon afterward as Alec and the rest of casting was completed in late summer.When a blizzard traps them in Alec s apartment they are forced to get to know each other beyond the confines of a onenight stand. Two Night Stand has its moments. But moments are all this movie has  and all its characters are likely to get. Two night Stand may turn into a permanent love affair if these two witty millennials have their way.well written this glimpse into the lives of this underserved rom com demographic makes the time..   ,TheRealmOfMalkioa,cx7uh0h,1,t5_2vdqm
