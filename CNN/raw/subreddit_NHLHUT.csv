38335,0,t3_1ujs5h,Was wondering that myself.  Also thought I read that having a stacked roster toptobottom affects the matchmaking mechanic  i.e. will pit you against similar topflight rosters... seemingly no matter what division youre in.  I thought I read that putting together a scrub th line probably dont want to go complete scrub on rd line as well and a scrub backup goalie will generally get you matched with weaker overall competition?  As the mechanic takes an average score from your lineup ratings and finds a like rated opponent.  If you weight it correctly and the other team doesnt do the same thing theyll have average players and youll have a superstar top  lines.Kind nice to know if thats true for someone like me still getting used to playing online against human players who saw crazy lineups last night and was lucky to go . or maybe . depending on how OTLs are factored in.,NHLHUT,ceisn90,1,t5_2yp50

301226,0,t3_1xjnvm,I run overload or behind net as my offensive schemes.  I pass back and forth between my D a lot and at the half boards.  User players will almost always chase the puck so for instance if you have the puck on the halfboards but are about to lose it a quick give and go with the D will almost always open up some space to the middle.  Overload is really good for getting high slot deflections too.  I think probably half the goals I score with Duchene and Vanek end up coming from low shots from the point getting deflected in.If you run behind the net as your scheme just be patient and look for chances to walk out in front with the whoever you have behind the net.  I like running a PWF type line if you want to run this scheme and just cycle until you get Burns or Neal or whoever behind and try to walk out in front and beat the goalie or dish to the high slot.,NHLHUT,cfbzkuh,1,t5_2yp50

1349868,0,t3_29j7g3, Boosting players. I like HUTs game mode because its your ultimate team so you should be able to use anyone to have a good team. But holy when ALL of my players feels like theyre skating in cement its so frustrating. You cannot get anything going because they will catch up to you no matter how much you hustle and how fresh your line is. I believe this is an effect of your opponent boosting their players. However correct me if Im wrong. It has to do with the game more than the game mode. But skating animations are so bad. It feels like everytime I pass it to a player in neutral zone or my defensive zone it feels like theyre skating backwards. Your player takes forever to turn and skate forward and its so easy to be bodycheckedpoke checked. Especially tough in neutral zone because you lose all your speed. Offsides. Damn those offsides. It can be a  on  Ill be skating full speed just to have my wingers go offside. Penalties. It may be because I have LShitting on but my computer goes ham on charginginterferenceelbowing penalties. Ill be trying to slow down the opposing player then my CPUAI would be skating all the way from the offensive zone taking a pretty good run on a player whether if its a guy thats in their way of path or the puck carrier. Ive even gotten  minute major for these instances but at least I injured their player. Delayed offsides. My defenders are too dumb to realize that there will be a offensive  threat once the opposing players tagup. They will skate up to the blue line just to get blown past leading to a breakaway. I try to manually control  to stay back though.,NHLHUT,cilhxa8,4,t5_2yp50

StammerDuchene Jagr for example would have one guy slowing down that line immensely. People have expectations of high OVR players they dont have of low ones leading to a lot of frustration and disappointment.... and posting to this sub with your exact message People tend to feed the puck to their star players leading to them playing poorly. If I feed my LW the puck all game Im totally flipping my play style. Good or bad people play new stud players differently.

Goalies are way different then skaters when making overall comparisons. But like you said the way goalies are programmed in general are off. In my experiments I found boosting goalies will do you no good in the long run. Theyll have too many attributes in one category and will try to overcompensate foregoing the puck in the back of the net. If you have a good mix of high low  rated attributes for a goalie unboosted or boosted theyre generally more consistent.,NHLHUT,cnhvj6d,1,t5_2yp50

Booters use a program that grabs your IP and they IP flood you. Theres nothing stopping them because you basically directly connect to each other.Even with servers through PSN and XBL booters can still grab your IP.Source I play a lot of competitive COD and its a prevalent thing in that community as well and some COD games have had dedicated servers however like I said through PSNXBL connections you connect via gamechat etc theyre still able to grab your IP.Overall its just really shitty.

The nav drawer contains all the leagues with icon and a count. Clicking one of those brings the main activity to a team list in recycler view. Selecting that brings you to another fragment with the roster and team info in a simple list with check boxes. Leagues teams and cards are listed in an XML layout.

Before I went and made the trade he then noticed that one of the guys I was trading to him now had multiple cards up for a much lower price so we altered the deal again last second because I wanted to be fair to him as well!I think it all depends on how you go about your negotiations.,NHLHUT,cqcce59,1,t5_2yp50

Voracek is fast can pass extremely well set up Ovi for a lot of one timers and can score equally well not very realistic but he has a hell of a one timer from the right slot...I scored a lot of goals on the rush either Ovi to Voracek or Voracek to Ovi and the other guy finished with a one timer. Just saying think youll like him. Hes also very solid defensively either on the forecheck or back in the defensive zone.As far as price I think Voracek might be selling for slightly less than TOTW Tavares now so Im not sure how you wanna do this.,NHLHUT,cqtiim4,1,t5_2yp50

3898138,0,t3_3534ta,I play a lot of solo to refine my gameplay and first I would suggest playing Great Britain on Superstar. Their team is awful but its a decent challenge if you use the time wisely to practice your passing and playmaking. Like some of the others have said work the puck around. Practice plays. Move your guys behind the net and try to setup a play in the slot. Put your defenders in formation and play a tight defense. If you use the time effectively and dont just take advantage of their team and pound in goals then you will get a lot out of it and notice a difference when you move back into division play. Hope this helps!,NHLHUT,cr0me0w,2,t5_2yp50

3910975,0,t3_357tdv,So if they are parking their forward in the slot what does that eliminate? Cross crease and walk ins. So alter your strategy to work around it. Keep it up high in the offensive zone and take point shots and crash the net.  If they are just sitting in the slot that pretty much eliminates one player to screw up passing . Move it around and cycle the puck. You will have to take shots from farther away but its nothing hard. Keep the shots low and go for deflection.Does it take action away? Only if your only way to score is cross crease and walk ins.  Seriously most of the people that complain about this are the types of players that think the only way to score is cross creases and one timers.I dont use skill zone but its something Ive never been fazed by as I always change my strategy up against players that use it. I think the players that use it do so because they are bad in the corners or in the slot which open too many cross crease pass opportunities.   If they make too many mistakes by using defenders and making themselves vulnerable its a completely viable strategy to stick to forwards. I believe they arent being cheap by doing so as long as they are in fact moving a little bit  but even then its nothing you cant work around. Is it less fun for you? It might be since you cant score on a cross crease. Is it more fun for them? Since it increases their chance of winning probably yes. Its not so much them using dirty tactics as your unwillingness to change your play style.,NHLHUT,cr234j1,3,t5_2yp50
3913502,0,t3_359mne,Its pretty hard to discuss the defense rating when you dont know what factors into that stat. You cant view the detailed stats of a player on current gen can you? On old gen and on NHL you can see the detailed stats of each player faceoff stats etc. The problem is that we dont know the formula for calculating the card stats or what stats are a part of that formula for example defense. Take Fifa for example. In Fifa you can view the detailed stats of every card including special versions in the game. Here is a picture of which detailed stats are part of each card stat and how much they affect it. As far as I know this formula with the detailed stats and the percentage is not known in NHL and as long as EA keeps us in the dark it will be very hard and pretty much pointless to discuss different card stats. My hope is that they at least will add full stats for every card in Nhl .,NHLHUT,cr2dhii,2,t5_2yp50

4524588,0,t3_3d16nk,I always enjoy playing against people who have reallife linesd pairs. I personally used MuzzinDoughty for a while and it worked fine. Currently icing as my rd line the HBL line from few years back aka HartnellBriereLeino and having tons of fun. Once I faced a guy who had HuberdeauBarkovJagr as hisher first line and man did I get beaten I think Hube scored  and Jagr scored few as well. So I would recommend building lines of currentpast reallife lines!Another idea would be to go back few years drafts and pick one draft year and build a best team you can get. For example  you could pick up really good guys like DucheneTavares but also a lot of other guys like Hedman OEL BSchenn Silfverberg Lehner Barrie etc.National teams are also fun you could go with European team each linedpair consisting of one nation?,NHLHUT,ct0yopm,1,t5_2yp50

5368947,0,t1_cvxv6go,in NHL they added gold cards of players who already had a bronze or silver card in the game such as Filip Forsberg silver card at launch and Aaron Ekblad bronze card at launch but there were several others as well.But they did add Legends some time before Christmas if I am not mistaken but those could have been in the database at launch only not released until certain date but I dont think anyone can confirm this to be true or not I mean whether Legend cards were in the database at launch.I certainly do hope they add the likes of Eichel Larkin etc to HUT as well when they add them in other game modes but based on NHL and Johnny Gaudreau missing all year unfortunately I think its unlikely.

5403481,0,t1_cw2bckm,This might be true I suppose I notice it less on other games or on regular versus. In HUT the purchased advantages are so noticeable that it affects the games fun. It is really frustrating to outplay someone but their goalie is borderline unbeatable and they score on  of the  shots they manage in a game. It just seems like a wasted opportunity for gamers that want to build a team GM style and compete but arent willing to shell out  on packs. EA obviously wont do it because they love the money but Id love to see a HUT mode where everything remains except boost cards. It would reward game skill over deep pockets.,NHLHUT,cw2cs19,1,t5_2yp50

5408076,0,t1_cw2xhs6,Yup. Spot on. Twothree years ago there were packs with double chance of rare or guaranteed special items. I remember once they brought back all previously released special cards. People loved those packspromotions and just waited for them instead of ripping packs all year. I think in the end they actually hurt overall sales and thats why we have never seen them again. Notice we havent even had a double coins day this year and barely any last year?  Id say we have a  chance of seeing auto upgrade movember cards again.

5962927,0,t1_cy15szu,Yeah I set the buy now max to  and camped out at the  minute mark. I altered the resale range based on if I wanted to sell quickly and use that auction spot to sell something else vs if I was going to bed and didnt mind if it took a full hour to sell. Also different teams have vastly different popularity.I also made a ton of coins on the change position cards because lots of people were setting the buy now to lt and the RDgtLD LWgtRW and RWgtLW would sell for . I wasted a ton of time trying to turn  coin profits on  attributes.  alls were a little more worthwhile but still too much of a time sink to be worth it. I work from home so I was able to keep  auctions live  hours a day. After awhile you get to know the values and the buysell process is muscle memory and you fly through it. It was useful at first but that process is not sustainable or worthwhile beyond building a coin base to be able to afford   players at a time. Once I had that base it was wayyyy easier to buy Subban for  and sell for . ,NHLHUT,cy19qzs,1,t5_2yp50

Its the players that are the problem. In todays NHL defensemen need to know how to skate well and move the puck not primarily block shots. The reason Erik Karlsson is the best defensemen in the world is that hes never in his defensive zone he move the puck with speed and controls the play in the offensive zone.

Sometimes there will be several TOTW or MS cards that will create different versions of certain players but the only ones that will get a ratings boost while you have them are MOV cards.,NHLHUT,cyr0aqa,2,t5_2yp50

6176996,1,t3_4064e7, Im a big hockey fan typically I use hockey which has my number in it but I went a different route this time.  I was born on the naval base in Connecticut when my father was in the US Navy. I love hockey and the NHL franchise. Have played since the original NHLPA game on Super Nintendo. My favorite NHL game is NHL  with Stevens and Yzerman on the cover. Plus the allure of always trying to make my team better is a nice challenge.  The last company I worked for had a long time employee get really sick terminal cancer. He passed away and the company paid for some of the funeral expenses and then some. It was around October when he passed and every year we did a company Christmas party where wed go to a fancy restaurant and have open bar for around  people. This particular year they still got everyone together but did it more cost effectively and then gave the money they would usually spend on the company party to the family to help them out.  I just couldnt believe the generosity that they showed to this man and his family.  My favorite team is the Bruins and I will put up the Nose Face Killah himself Brad Marchand. My team name is Broken Wing.  Will do kind sir thank you!Wow a down vote? Thanks anonymous person. ,NHLHUT,cyrrdq0,3,t5_2yp50

6308596,0,t3_420xe3,i say go cheap where you can th line amp rd pairing so you can get some killer players on your top lines. Gaborik nyquist and mackinnon have lots of speed and are only k ish each right now. Burns would be sweet with Keith. Suter with ekman Larson. Letang and giordanonever played with him as your third could pick up Myers to play with letang hes super cheap and under rated I seam to score a point shot with him every game. Taylor hall and Rick Nash To play with mov backes on your rd. I like big bodies who can win face offs in the middle and for k you can get jordan staal for your th with mackinnon and gaborik. Now you would still have tons of cash for your top two lines which if I was in your position I would have to use to try bure even if its cheap junior flashback bure.

6596795,0,t3_461ame,EA will argue that it makes the game more realistic. Which unfortunately it does. I want the best players to play better than the average ones but I also do not want to spend k to buy that team. If EA cracked down on selling coins through other outlets it would be extremely difficult and extremely expensive to have these stacked teams. Its impossible for me to side one way or the other on this but at least they are trying to fix the game. ,NHLHUT,d01nvd8,2,t5_2yp50

How to use the multiuser data profiles feature Pro version TB .. or aboveCreate the data profiles you want    In the Overview screen hit Switch profile then Create a new data profile.    If your goal is to have separate Angry Birds high scores repeat the previous step to create one profile per player.    Click on Switch profile and activate the profile that matches your current data. For example if you played the game already youll want to activate your own profile now so that the current data gets assigned to that profile in the next step.    Switch to the apps list    Make the apps multi profile aware. For each app    Longclick on the app    Click on Enable multiple profiles for this app. Your current data for that app will be moved into the profile you activated in the previous step.    Create a profile switching widget optional    Hit the HOME button    Longclick on the background    Click on Widgets    Choose Titanium Backup Data Profiles.    The widget is on your background now.

6783732,0,t3_48o9ln,After what I see from the answers you provide we play a similar if not the same style. I also go for the logical best method to score dependind on where Im on the Offzone and where is my opponent Im also a decent DIV  player  ish I also run my player at their natural position which is pretty rare in DIV  lol Actually I only have one offside winger and its Hossa so its hard for T We have a similar team No big superstars but a Okish teamThe only thing I do that probably not many other people in Division  do is that I shot a lot on goal... I average between  shots per game. Of course theyre not all high  shots but every puck going toward the opp net is a chance.If I have a chance to take a shot with  player in front of the net Ill take it even if its not the hardest. Deflect screening whatever can happen.Cycling the puck in the offzone is a great option also to open lanes. I found this more funny then doing circles with  player. Yes its more risky from getting intercepted but after a couple of games youll know where and where not to cycle the puck.Dont know if this will help you let me know ,NHLHUT,d0l802s,1,t5_2yp50

I would be interested in either just purchasing the card for  or possibly trying to get it on a loan to open the collection packs. However I dont have much to offer in ways of collateral as the only things of value I have is Petro Backes Shatty and like k coins and give those as collateral would ruin the point of trying to complete the set for the packs. If one of you vets could give me some tips how the buyingsellingloaning works I would appreciate it. Also if someone is willing to work something out with me let me know as well.

7432453,0,t1_d2n0oex,Agreed. Its almost amazing to me that people honestly dont recognize just how good Doughty is defensively. People can say whatever theyd like but there is a reason why a lot of people think he should win. There is nobody in the NHL better in clutch situations on defense right now than Drew Doughty and I say that not as a kings fan but someone who watches a lot of hockey. I concede that offensively both Burns and Karlsson are better in the offensive zone but defensively it just isnt close. I hope he wins. If they want to create a best offensive defenseman category than fine he isnt in the running. But that isnt what the Norris is or should be.,NHLHUT,d2n0txx,0,t5_2yp50

All black  This team I play whenever I want to laugh and have a good time  some challenge. Iginla is the whitest boy in this lineup and they all just look amazing in simple white jerseys with only Maple Leafs logo. Its nothing racist it just looks so unnatural and funny. People message me laughing after every second game.Line for example  J.Ward  Colin Smith  W. Simmonds  M. Fortunus  J. Subban Nr.I call them the Lumberjacks. In this team there are only GRN  only other exception is ENF John Scott. I run them also as my defense they are lost clueless but its so fun. Injuring  players a game is fun. I dont go around and hit I try to play as usual but those guys hit pretty hard haha. Line example  Roussel  Ott  Scott  Reaves  Clutterbuck I have so much fun playing those lineups playing with my favorite guys and creating nice plays in lineup  trying to win with those low OVR players in lineup  or flying around clueless grinders in lineup .

Make it so that you play best out of  in each series.  So you have to win  of  first to progress or youre out until you reach the Stanley Cup finals and if you win that you win the cup get like K and with each playoff series win you get a free playoff pack.  So instead of just D finals you get Stanley Cup titles.  I think this will make it more interesting.,NHLHUT,d34cj0c,2,t5_2yp50

Is this guy going to sue for ingame currency? So you wouldnt get anywhere in any type of lawsuit as  the cards have no real world value and  nobody can prove anything at all.

Yes the kid was in the wrong for doing what he did but why is nobody thinking that he person who built the hut rep throughout his time in the game did not have this planned as a long running scam attempt? Take some responsibility for your actions of not using the game the way its meant and trying to shortcut the system for your own benefit. It is majority the fault of the people paying and getting paid by others for virtual items. Is it right to scam people? NO! Every needs to understand that whenever you commit to breaking the rules buying selling coinsplayers you are automatically taking the risk of losing your money. If he was selling his cards to pay bills he should not have put money he did not have into this game in the first place. I have empathy for the victim but cannot feel sorry for him not being able to pay bills when he had time to plan for those expenses other than illegally selling his players. Long story short if you do not want to get scammed dont participate in events that can cause you to! Sorry for the rant but I just feel that nobody looks at the other side of the story and only focus on the people committing the crime. ,NHLHUT,d3a6h8n,1,t5_2yp50

The card doesnt actually get the synergy boost until it has been filled so  bronze or  silvers or a gold and a bronze or a platinum to boost the card and anytime you sell or trade it resets it back to  of  sides filled. Then instead of change position cards you would have change synergy cards. ,NHLHUT,d4jc9gi,1,t5_2yp50

8202825,0,t3_4rp2j0,So sick of people whining about skill zone. If youve ever played against the computer its essentially the same thing. The best part of online hockey is how different everyone plays. If everyone played the exact same  it would get boring. Go ahead skill zone I dont care its challenging sometimes when they do it well but I like challenges. Ive played  games and instead of crying about computer controlled defense I just learned to play against it. Sure if they make it so you cant do that in   then great whatever. Doesnt matter to me. People will still find other ways to complain they cant win hockey games all the time. TLDR its a game keep practicing ,NHLHUT,d52wnsx,9,t5_2yp50

8434742,0,t3_4v6p2p,Personally I love the game. Maybe because it seems to fit my play style better I dunno. But I truly feel like this feels more like a hockey simulation game than ever before. There are very few game mechanics that can be used and abused to all hell like in years past defending isnt useless anymore and scoring takes more time and effort involving  more cycling and passing than speed to the outside cross crease goal. Personally I think its a change for the better and that it feels the least arcadey it ever has. ,NHLHUT,d5vvrmj,3,t5_2yp50

In the coming days once the demand is still high for the players and the supply is low you can resell them for higher than what you paid.Plus you can always play the longgame and hold onto players and sell them when they meet requirements for a limited set thats going on.,NHLHUT,d6wl8bx,1,t5_2yp50

But in every other way the AI is just incredibly bad.

9053391,0,t3_549w23,I had lost my  preorder packs also opened a ticket and waited the  hours but finally got them back.I opened the ticket on Friday and had to call them on Monday to see where progress was. I told my story of having  packs and that on Friday night after seeing posts in Reddit checked my acct and had only . He told me that there is a scam going around on Reddit and that there is no such thing as  preorder packs and that according to what he sees I opened my  weekly packs which I did scared of losing them also. I said there are  preorder packs and I wanted them back. He said no and I shouldnt scam him. I asked for supervisor he put me on hold for about  sec and hung up on me.I resumed case again a different guy called back said he can see where I didnt open but   starter  rub and  packs so yea I didnt have my preorder and it took him just a few minutes to get them to me. He said also that the packs shouldnt expire just the weekly. The person I talked to on Friday when I opened the case said the same. Which may or may not be true since EA support seems to be confused about their productpolicy.You will have to prove preorder with receipt or some kind of confirmation and basically hope to get a rep that knows what they are talking about or thats willing to help. First experience with EA Support and hope its my last.After all the trouble was so pissed I packed a Taylor Hall and Zuccarello which are now  of my best cards and a Weber from last weekly.Good Luck.,NHLHUT,d802n3h,3,t5_2yp50

9086801,0,t1_d842khu,Its not a matter of rich people getting richer or poor people remaining poor. Its a matter of perspective. Its completely destroys the market. Let me give you an example. I purchased a Getzlaf at the start of the game for k one week later he was at k now you can get him for below k and that is an  OVR player who is a favourite to many. The market is incredibly volatile and all of these packs being released one after the other is incredibly detrimental towards the stability of the auction house.For example. You can now pick up premium players I.E Crosby Ovi Kane for chips this year half of what they were the previous  titles and while that makes them more attainable to the casual gamer. I feel that it takes the reward from more serious gamers grinding to earn the rewards of a premium player that will be alot more common due to its availability at such a low price it kind of ruins the game everyone owning allstar teams IMO. While Im by no way a serious gamer I do put a few hours in here and there streaming and the such and Im fortunate enough that I get my teams by payingplaying for it. Just my . on the situation but I strongly feel that the constant stream of new packs and the sheer attainability of premium players this year is a little ridiculous. I understand it is called Ultimate Team but you should not be able to achieve an Ultimate Team of Superstars for chips. Destroys the whole concept of the grind and takes off the excitement. Pulling an  in previous titles was like seeing tits for the first time a little scared followed by excitement swiftly followed by elation. It was magical now its just common practice. It ruins it IMO. Sorry for the spool!,NHLHUT,d84353i,2,t5_2yp50

There seems to be as many holes if not more the usual players skate right by pucks with out picking them up but theyll swat a slap shot down or a clear from  feet away. Not to mention its impossible to switch to the player you want so you end up dragging people way out of position cause your headed the wrong way. Hold the stick hit to long and your player just clears it the auto switching isnt even consistent. All in all I wish I had bought madden that is a well put together game where a player with a better catch catches more balls the faster player out runs the slower player there isnt any mention of ice tilt which is very real btw what do you think ea means when they say feel the momentum when you play nhl it feels like the game is pre decided  of the time the match making is terrible and way more pay to win then any of eas other games. All in all fuck nhl but I spent  plus another  on packs trying to be competitive with nothing to show for it and pissed off after every game no matter if its a win or a loss cause it doesnt feel like my actions had anything to do with the out come of the game.  ,NHLHUT,d95w9y4,2,t5_2yp50

Or to change for MOV with potential e.g. OVI for MOV Scheifele Crosby for MOv Backstrom again more synergies plus in a few weeks those players will have higher or equal ratings. With the extra money you can upgrade other weaker roster spots.Third Looking on your roster the frist think comes to my mind is MOV Sedin. He is neither fast nor he has a big body.

If not Ill most likely wait if I think Ill be able to sell it in the coming days for the price I want. I was saving up for a mov Burns a few days ago and he was going for  upwards. I was trying trades but no one bit. At the time I only had k so I wasnt that close. All of a sudden someone listed him with a bin of k. I raced to the AH and posted a mov staal k under the cheapest one on the market. It sold immediately and the Burns was still available.

10056116,0,t3_5jqvkq,I finally just got over this hump and won a D title . The one thing that I notice is the lack of pure opportunities you get. I routinely play games in d where me and my opponent do not even have  shots. I completely changed my game and went to a possession style game and focus on T shots or passing up a shot and skating to a better shot. You have to capitalize on your opportunities because there are not many. Defensively well a lot of this depends on your opponents play style. You have to adapt your defense and cannot play the same defense every game. Hope this helps,NHLHUT,dbic47z,3,t5_2yp50

Theres a bot that messages users to add flair then removes their post if they dont. I love it. The issue is that some mobile apps even the official one doesnt let you flair posts and like half of the people here are on mobile. They plan to enhance the bot so I can add custom PMs and inform users how to add flair using the bot itself but its still in the works. When thats in I plan to test it again.gt I dont know if this is possible new users should have to lurk for like a week or so to get the idea of the sub and after that theyd be able to commentpostThats an interesting one!

10189247,0,t3_5lvsas,Said this and Ill say it again...EA needs to start banningaccountwiping people who purchase coins from third parties. People should not have the ability to purchase the best players but only the chance to pull them in packs. Its become far too mismatched for free to play players at the highest divisions.Tighter regulations alongside more ways to earn cards through playing like they did with the title packs will really balance HUT and make it more about skill and time invested and less than just money invested.This is obviously in the best interest of EA as more people would be buying packs except that they would lose a portion of their player base who are frustrated they cant buy their ultimate team with coins.,NHLHUT,dbz0aec,2,t5_2yp50

10208456,0,t1_dc164d3,also your mention of not having enough players in your time zone....In div  or  I have never had to wait more than a min to find an opponent with a good connection. if your having trouble I assume this is because you are in Div  and there are only a couple thousand players in that Div. So removing some Div  or lower opponents is not going to affect your ability to match up. Its simply going to take them away from having to play the stacked teams that are only beating them because some of their player ratings are better. So then good players iwth stacked teams still win their games and good players with an average squad also get their wins.Also this will stop people from deranking just to get div titles playing lower end teams.,NHLHUT,dc16ok0,1,t5_2yp50

10317256,0,t1_dcdi3po,It depends on your playstyle a lot. Teamwheel is always a great one but the cheap players are really bad. I like Cycle Game and Team Shotblocking quite a bit because both give Agility which makes players feel much better if you like to spin around in corners and make quick turns. Trap is also always nice it makes an average defensive player into a decent one and a good one to an elite one more or less. If you check out base players with say  def awareness and stick checking and compare the to the ones with  in both the difference is fairly clear.  in both include the likes of Burns Backes Josi Oreilly and s are Barrie Irwin Voracek Kucherov.,NHLHUT,dcdimaq,1,t5_2yp50

I could only assume before because I would only play either all common teams that would beat me and my AI felt wrong and rare teams that were better but still something felt off.

10398589,0,t1_dcmpzd2,gt in that screen shot you can see both points are coveredLook again the left point sure as shit is NOT covered.  That guy has a blue sweater on and is skating out of the zone.  If any blue player can skate the puck into the upper right circle there is a wide open breakaway pass lane.gt In no level of hockey is it okay to leave your assignment to cover for someone else Have you ever played hockey?  I do.  I suck but I do understand the fundamentals of positioning and defensive responsibility and your statement is absolutely false.  Schultz is the furthest D back and is therefore responsible for the ice behind him either side.  Note that when he moves to cover that open man the breakout hasnt happened yet.  How was Schultz to know that YOU were about to blow YOUR assignment?Anyway even before you go for the bit hit overplaying your assignment you have already pulled players out of position.  I would normally presume thats your left D down near the top of the left circle and FACING AWAY from a streaking opponent however if you watch the clip right at the start hes much closer but actually TURNS AWAY and skates toward the net.  That tells me hes actually a forward and thinks he should be low  why the hell else would he do this when you DONT have the puck?!  This situation likely arose because you skated a D down low forcing a forward to move back to cover.  Now Ill give you this  the forward should know better than to just drop the guy at the point but this is part of HUT that you have to be aware of  the AI is not too terrible unless you pull them out of position then theres no knowing what theyre going to do.This is why some dont believe in icetilt because people blame their own mistakes on the AI presuming that their better team should be able to just bail them out of every mistake.,NHLHUT,dcmqvtx,1,t5_2yp50

Its a matter of executing it correctly which is controlled by the user in the game.

10498836,0,t1_dcxz2mb,I see the desync glitch as an incredibly hard issue for them to fix. From what I understand hut games are hosted PP peer to peer basically meaning you have a direct connection to your opponent. They have no real way to determine that you are being desynced since its an attack directly against your network  in other words it appears to them as if you have disconnected  quit. Their only real options are removing the loss if you disconnect and as you can imagine that would be a disaster since anytime anyone is going to lose they simply quit or the  only real solution in my eyes is to enforce obvious desyncers more strictly by banning them. ,NHLHUT,dcy5jkf,4,t5_2yp50

10689347,0,t1_ddi5kr8,Havent played a Madden game since like  so i cant comment there but Ive always had FIFA or MLB as my nd sports games. I agree with the other things you say about hockey being a sport wellsuited for video games. FIFA and Madden have so many players on the field so the input lag really screws people some games.Only thing they can really improve on in NHL going forward gameplaywise is detailed collision detection like in FIFA. NHL has definitely improved in that aspect over the years with the new physics engine but FIFA is still superior there IMO. Since like  Ive practically seen no clipping in the FIFA games. Every part of every players body can collide with other players and the ball in any wayspeed. It effects gameplay significantly when it comes to blocking goalies freeform deking shouldertoshoulder battles etc.In NHL its there to an extent but we still see sticks clipping through everything puck clipping through skates players slippingsqueezing by the board impossibly invisible stick penalties etc. It gets easy to exploit once youre decent at the game at it adds to the online cheese.Another thing that I think isnt really fair in NHL is CPU teammate penalties in online games. Its not too big of a deal for me but I cant remember much of that happening in FIFA.But anyway one more thing I can add to what you said   if you took the one of the best online players and a good online player from NHL FIFA Madden MLB or NBA k or EA and you gave the best players a decent base team and the good players a stacked team I feel like in every series the good player would win a lot more except for NHL. I too feel like skill and selfcreating luck are more significant in NHL.,NHLHUT,ddiizs3,1,t5_2yp50

10692361,0,t3_5sxj4c,I tend to agree with most of what the other guy said. Havent tried that many of the iPotg cards but Gauthier is good if you like his synergies and can play center. If youre comfortable trying out ASG Smith at starter you should consider picking up Carter Hart for your backup hes not that expensive and it would go a long way towards getting TW active. Alternatively if you have many collectibles accumulated and havent done the hero sets Id do at least one of those as probably the cheapest way to add impact players. Heres my team if you want some idea on ways to add synergies on the cheap if you dont go the TW route most of my cards were cheap when I bought them not real sure what their market is like now.,NHLHUT,ddiu6nb,2,t5_2yp50

10767691,0,t3_5u0sdp,My TeamAlthough the top  lines are stacked my favorite is the rd line. LW MOV Wheeler Big body great shot can hold the puck and lay the body with ease. C MOV Toews Great FO just a pure center fights in the corners and in front of the net for position better than anyone.RW MOV Backstrom Where do I even start? Speed hands awareness both ends and his dekes are just smooth as can be. Hes the perfect playmaker and always incredible with the puck.This line plays so well together with Behind the Net strategy. I cycle a lot and like to use the boards when passing. Wheeler with the RH shot on LW loves to play on the boards protect the puck walking in to the top of the circle and fire a wrister top left corner while Toews is screening the goalie. On the rush I like to send a soft sauce pass into the right corner and let Backy use his wheels to get to it once hes there its either back to the point to start the cycle or fire it around for Wheeler Toews just causes trouble in the center of the ice and usually draws  or both defenders out of position.,NHLHUT,ddqlvrr,1,t5_2yp50

10839523,0,t3_5uz1s2,I agree with uScruffsMcGuffs on this one. Reminds me of the McSnipealot crosby he got from anon. My idea would be something like positive sub contribution where the mods give a score for every nice and helpful postcomment. There would be bonus points given if a member of the sub submitted a screencap of the person being awesome. Then every nice or helpful thing would get some score and the one with the most points wins and second place etc... could be a lot of work but there are many people here who do great things and go unnoticed all the time and unrecognized in the way they should. Whether its circlejerking about Brent Burns and having some laughs or complimenting someone on their skill or making a post about card upgrades and synergies i think a lot of good stuff goes heavily unnoticed.Thanks Scooty uScooterThis was a great idea,NHLHUT,ddy0qa3,1,t5_2yp50

The user with the most points at the end of the game is victorious. Scoring is fairly straightforward but keep a pen and paper nearby to log results. This game is about integrity!  Period  DominoesThe objective in the first period is to rack up as many hits as possible without bending the rules. Keep your hands off the elbow button!    hit   point  penalty minute   point Tally points at end of period using the stat tracker at intermission.  Period  Iron WristNever will the ping! off the iron sound better. The objective in the second period is to hit as many posts and crossbars as possible. Youre all too familiar with the sound queue needed to be heard to score points in this round so get high volume shots off towards the goal!    postcrossbar   points Must be opponents net to count. Goals scored off the iron are to be counted.  Tally points as the period progresses keeping an ear open for the ping it is hard noise to miss!  Period  Light the Lamp  Prepare to snipe. The objective in the third period is to score goals without missing shots on goal quality over quantity!    goal   points   missed shot on goal   point If youre going to miss go wide or high of the net to avoid the penalty.   Tally points at the end of the period using the box score stat tracker GoalsShotsGoals.  Notes Add up the points from the three periods to determine the winner. Any tiebreaker will be broken by time on attack after regulation. If an overtime period is forced the result does not impact scoring.

11068023,0,t3_5y1zzk,I am the one that bitches about it being a glitch all the time. I will own that. Basically to me it breaks the faceoff system. Because why ever setup forehand if you can do basically every single win from the backhand setup? At that point why not just see who can pull down on the right stick and trash the whole thing? Because aside from RB variations here are your options normally on the backhand Win back backhand Tie up Stick lift backhandand forehand Win back forehand Tie up Stick lift forehandIf you do the glitch method you can Win back backhand Tie up Stick lift backhand Win back forehand Stick lift forehandSo you basically do everything you can do from both setups from one. It becomes  options vs.  options. And if you are both glitching it is v which is completely pointless because it is just random chance at that point. Just pick something and then hope it works. Removes really any skill aspect to it.Oh and generally to beat that particular win the stick lift is best until they start just winning it straight back or tying you up.Sorry for the novel this is without a doubt the most rage inducing thing about the game for me.,NHLHUT,demjt1z,0,t5_2yp50

11093946,0,t3_5yf11y,Whether you like a certain seasons requirements or not you cant overlook the huge upgrade in one year on longterm playability of this game. People bitched and moaned all the time last year about how theres nothing to play for other than division titles for a handful of coins. This year both with division title rewards playoff rewards and CS theres a lot more to play for and players are playing more games and staying with the game longer.  The easiest way to see that thats the case is the fact that theres been no Happy Hours and no Golden Tickets this year. Happy Hour is a tool EA has to increase coin supply  theyve needed to do it in years past to keep the market in check. It was cloaked as a Thank You to players but it was really an economic stimulus at their disposal.  Golden ticket was the same thing with a different package  drove pack sales but really was there to increase coin supply to counteract a dwindling player base.Remember the only ways new coins are created in this game are a playing games and associated rewards  b quick selling items and c the daily bonuses. With all the trade in sets and the use of carbon for jerseyslogosarenascoaches I am willing to bet the amount of coins coming from quicksell this year has plummeted drastically. So were left with one significant way coins come in  and its healthy enough that they havent needed to goose it yet.  ,NHLHUT,dephlxz,22,t5_2yp50

11190173,0,t3_5zrfe7,Good review man.  Im considering the Stammer and I actually liked his synergy stack. Heres why  HH gets his body check from  to  his Strength from  to  and his DAW from  to . Relatively these are three areas he needed to have beefed up for an elite card.  CG Not worried about this impact on him but a  pointer helps potentially take some less desirable guys in the lineup out. CG is pretty common though so this is fairly low impact.  CS Maxes out SSA WSA and OAW. He was close already but this seals it at  for all.  TK Maxes his DAW moves stick check from  to  maxes his passing and gets Poise to . Very impactful.  DC DAW is redundant as its already maxed with above lit up. Faceoffs get a buff to  obviously should still be a winger and moves shot blocking up to .  On paper these synergies really shore up Stammers statistical weaknesses. Add on a couple team synergies TWSBT would be great for him and hes really much more well rounded.  Proof is on the ice though  thanks for the insight.,NHLHUT,df0e5mi,2,t5_2yp50

11220526,1,t3_605s59,So I feel like I should address the elephant in the room which is obviously which moderators? are to blame for this whole debacle. The Placement of BlameLets start off with uEASPORTSNHLs official statement on rNHLHUT titled An Update From Us.ampnbspEA starts off by praising the community to get on their good side and then begins to throw us moderators under the bus. gtWhen first starting up we granted the mods weekly packs as a thank you for the work they do constantly moderating this sub. Unfortunately it has recently come to our attention that there are moderators that have continued to break our Terms of Service while receiving these items. sourceampnbspSo for starters apparently the moderators is plural meaning two or more moderators have been breaking EAs TOS. This was also brought up again in a comment from their own subreddit. gtWe already figured out who was at fault. It was unfortunately multiple mods. sourceampnbspDue to the fact that EA never told us or anybody for that matter which specific TOS violation took place and by which multiple users it leaves us all guessing.The ProofYesterday was a shitstorm. It started off as a witch hunt and eventually became more civil. I personally had a few users down my throat trying to play detective and stating how theyve lost respect for me. ampnbspThis image has been posted all around the sub in the past  hours.gtLooking to buy coins in bulk PM me if youre interested in selling to me.ampnbspSo here this user is simply looking to violate the TOS. The same way Saad was looking to violate the TOS buy inquiring to sell his cards to uanonmarmot.  ampnbspuFixTheDesync sums it up perfectly here sourceampnbspgtI do have four HutReps and am willing to share them in PMs upon request. P.S. I may be a prepubescent child from outer space.Although I do understand this point that this may look like its me literally anybody could have posted this in their comment. ampnbspContinuing the theory that I am at fault Mr. Detective also found a user posting to my personal HutRepgt Bought k from him fast and reliable as always.  month ago sourceampnbspIt does happen quite a lot that users forget to confirm a sale or just ignore it all together. Not saying that uafmjh just forgot and gave the rep comment later than the transaction but it very well could have been the case.The Verdict  I can confirm that I have not made a sale or bought from another user on my Xbox account. Simple as that. ampnbsp uhutcoinsalesmod hasnt been actively looking for coins for over a month now not sure if that matters but I thought Id point it outampnbsp Which two or more users violated TOS? I am not sure.ampnbsp Why didnt EA back up their claims? I believe they didnt have sufficient evidence and that it is mainly pure speculation.ampnbsp I honestly believe the main reason for this was that EA wanted complete control. I could be wrong but thats my thoughts.In conclusion I may or may not be a prepubescent child from outer space.,NHLHUT,df3tzf2,1,t5_2yp50

Why do you think people were so pissed at the movember rereleased sets? everyone that did it the way they were supposed to got screwed because they paid out the ass for the movember collectibles and everyone that came in late still got the reward but for a fraction of the cost.

11650674,0,t3_6687k4,With the right synergies activated he is a very useful player and he offers a good priceratioperformance with the addition of  synergies. With his speed and agility he can be a game changer in lower rated teams where most of the other players have similar ratings in the  overall range. With SF and X activated he also offers good shoting skills.However when you have an ultimate team with several highend TOTYs or MOVs his impact is limited and he is maximum a fourth liner. Compared to left hand players for the right wing like Malkin Marchand Benn Pacioretty Kane etc. there is of course some kind off difference.However I use him on the second line of my second team and this guy really makes fun and scores on a regular base.I think K is fine. lately Steel usually costs a bit more so you did not overpay. However. I would not say this is some kind of investment. He will may rise bit within the next  weeks but soon or later his price will drop and at he end he is just a  overall. HUT players always looking for higher rated options. ,NHLHUT,dggm99z,1,t5_2yp50

11667142,0,t3_66gsdr,I use SCE Allen. With that said I have yet to find a goalie in this game that I enjoy playing with  all goalies let in the same type of goals for the most part...I cannot compare him to Kolzig or Hextall  its been awhile since Ive used those goalies but Allen can definitely hold his own.  I use an AllTime Blues team in Division  and I can say that he makes the saves I would expect him to make while stopping some crazy onetimers as well.His weakest point in his game is aggressiveness.  Much like Patrick Roy he will be very aggressive on shots and breakaways which is good for stopping the initial shot however this leaves rebounds in front of a mainly open net.  If your opponent picks up on this you could be in for a looooonnnggg game.I would rate him at an  overall.  That is over  games played with his  overall card.

11687448,0,t3_66rqox,Ill do  hero sets as opposed to the  I did this year. Every time I think about my  unused hero collectibles its infuriating. There is no possible card that could come out at this point that will have made those sets worth doing when there are   ovr cards coming out next month that will each cost K each to make. Then Ill invest very heavily in MOV. This year I invested in most midupper tier MOVs which was pretty profitable but it seems like the elite MOVs like Malkin Tarasenko Kane etc are the ones that shoot up even higher in value. Will definitely keep this in mind when I decide which cards to invest in. ,NHLHUT,dgksg1c,3,t5_2yp50

I aim towards the side the pass is coming from that way my guy isnt winding up and being forced out of position by me pressing up on the left stick too early bc obviously the left stick is to aim your shot. Same reason why some may whiff on a slapshot that isnt a one timer. You are skating up and move the right stick down to wind up but u still hold the left stick up to aim high and then he whiffs. Have to let go of the left stick when winding up and move up both sticks at the same timeaim and shoot at the same timeor maybe aim slightly early.,NHLHUT,dgvaiyt,1,t5_2yp50
