1528189,0,t1_cj7qi7e,Its from Egghead!! I almost forgot about you today. A sizable spill of coffee shot me to my feet holding up my mochasoaked notebook like an unclaimed child. A dozen eyes found me at once a security measure meant to bring shame to a klutz breaking his social contract. Attention for shit living. When the pain receded I stood in place and imagined you brushing your teeth.,boburnham,cj7u391,3,t5_2smrh

7486723,0,t3_4gx2az,I was there! For future reference I planned to get there an hour before ended up about  minuets before by that time the line wrapped around the first second and third floor.

7812842,0,t3_4mbvb8,Personally thought the live show was paced a little better. The special seemed to lack a lot of the audienice banter between bits which made the sequencing really feel rushed to me.That being said I still loved it. The closer still moves me every time and all the sections translate well to a TV special. Bos specials always feel like theyre more than just a traditional comedy show and I really hope he decides to continue in this medium because these last  specials have been truly spectacular.,boburnham,d3u87r7,27,t5_2smrh

7886314,0,t3_4n9dsf,I thought this as well while watching. I could just see in his face the disdain when he farts into the mic and everyone laughs.

7903036,0,t3_4nimo7,He means that you simply are or arent happy.But then he realizes it is more complex than that. So he says on a scale of one to two because happiness isnt a yes or no. ,boburnham,d44dkb3,11,t5_2smrh

8010234,0,t3_4ofjvv,Mike Birbiglia isnt musical at all but he shares a lot of the more serious heartfelt moments that Bo does a lot in his specials. Id say that both of their most recent specials Make Happy and My Girlfriends Boyfriend respectively are more oneman shows than standup specials they both know that they dont always have to go for laughs and inject a lot of meaning in their acts.,boburnham,d4gfbfw,2,t5_2smrh

9552902,0,t3_5bjtg2,I saw Make Happy pretty early in the tour so there was a song or  that wasnt written yet. I know he mentioned the show wasnt done and therefore he played is Gods Perspective. My friend who came with me said we had another verse of Pandering about Taylor Swift but I dont really remember. He also made tons of jokes about the venue because he couldnt get over the acoustic paneling. I hate to say this but I kinda wish I had sound recorded it just for my own sake so I could remember the difference between what I saw and the special. Also because the opener was hilarious and I cant remember the guys name.,boburnham,d9qlcc3,2,t5_2smrh

10604977,0,t1_dd9tdtw,Similar melodies exist everywhere and I think that its to be somewhat expected especially with a country song that was written specifically to sound like every other country song that exists. Also. The definitions and guidelines of what plagiarism actually is are so vague and undefined that its really hard to determine what is plagiarism and what isnt but as long as it was significant and was taken with the intent to pass it off on ones own then yes that is plagiarism. I dont know what touhou is but bo has always written his own music and I think its probably more likely that you came across a song that just to happens to sound like his intentionally generic country song. I am pretty confident that he has more integrity than that. I also am not certain how serious you are about this plagiarism thing? Is this just supposed to be like a check out this song that sounds similar? or do you actually think he stole the melody from this touhou song?,boburnham,dd9tmd9,6,t5_2smrh
