You need to be doing speculative applications and expanding your network doing voluntary work amp letting others know youre looking for work.        You have sales exp and a degree. I suggest you send a cv and cover letter to every estate agent or car dealer and tell them how youve always wanted to be an estate agent or car salesman and how your skillsexp is relevant.       You say from being a bin man as if its the lowest job youve went for.

8350818,0,t3_4trw56,Fellow Irish expat to Newcastle here!Ive lived in Heaton for  years. Its  metro stops from Manors metro Northumbria unis metro and  stops from Monument the city centre metro. Its  minutes on the metro to Tynemouth area BEACH! Heaton is full of delicious restaurants and cafes its got a big gym and Asda and a park and its walking distance to places like Jesmond. Theres also a smaller Tescos and Sainsburys you really dont need a car if you live here.Jesmond is nice but expensive. Closer to the city centre. And much more studentfilled than Heaton.Gosforth is nice posher than Heaton. Slightly more suburban feel but its not far from the city centre by metro.Letting agent wise Ive not had any terrible experiences and Rightmove is really  good here pretty much used by all the big letting agents.,NewcastleUponTyne,d5lelsj,3,t5_2s4zy
