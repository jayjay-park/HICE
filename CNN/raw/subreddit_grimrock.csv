2184850,0,t3_2jreas,There are a few methods for this Once in the secret room area stand at the hidden button with your back to the statue.  Back up and click the button while moving as quick as possible toward the furthest teleporter.  Youll get there barely in time. Someone already mentioned that you can get there immediately after the first teleport.  I tried this a dozen times and never had enough time.  YMMV The other method gives you much more time to get to the teleporter but you have to enter it at the exact right moment or youll end up right back where you started. When first activating the teleporter to the secret room drop something on the pad and immediately pick it back up.  Enter the teleporter. Use the hidden button and instead of entering a teleporter fire an arrow or something with decent range through the second one.  The teleporters will activate again since your arrow just landed on the original pad and youll have plenty of time to step left and forward just dont do it too quickly. ,grimrock,clhjq13,1,t5_2ssew

2204407,0,t1_cljq7i6,My actual experience with playing a farmer is different than what you are describing.The instant you have beaten the first boss you can rush for the river amp Sleet Island. By emptying both of fish youll be at least level  while everyone else is still at  or . Energywise my farmer had over  energy by level . The stat gains are equivalent to that of a battle mage and you can get Orb of Radiance  a staff  a energy cape within the first hour of the game no problem possibly even the  energy amuletnecklace I cant remember where I got it.There is immense value in being able to have both Fire  or Air  and Alchemy  before entering the ruins of Desarune or Pyramid of Umas. It means you can delay spending any alchemy ingredients until you have stronger potions because the game prior to that point is easy and requires no potions per se. And you will have very strong damagepotential from your airfire spell. The starvation matters less or more depending on your party. I mean Ive played the game four times and every single time Ive had everyone starve by the end of Ruins of Desarune whether I had a farmer on board or not. So if theyre going to starve anyway its not a big deal. And my frontrow tends to be supertanks with literally zero skill points invested into dealing damage and doubleshields who later use bombs made with Alchemy  for tough spots. I dont think starvation affects whether Frost Bombs will proc freezing. The lack of resting is a nuisance since I need to return to save crystals far more frequently but from a minmaxing perspective you actually have more gains than loss from a mage farmer. Its just annoying to have to spend the first hour emptying the rivers of fish then backtracking to save crystals every encounter. Though by the point you have the levels you need you can start feeding the rest of your party. And of course its lategame potential is not the greatest. But mages in general have diminishing returns in the lategame. By the point you have   Concentration and  in a damage element your returns on leveling up are far less than they were going from  to  in said damage element. I probably would not play Farmer on a hard playthrough but this is only because the battle mage  resistance and  protection is so much more appealing on hard since you will not be able to completely avoid having your backrow get hit by attacks.Edit I just had a realization. Areas in the game scale according to your level. Thats why I saw Summon Stones in Twigroot forest at the start with my farmer but never on any of my other playthroughs until exiting the Crystal Mines. This kind of does limit farmers to challenge runs since overleveling them will just make areas significantly harder. Would be nice to know at what exact levels an area will change some areas seem to have at least  different variants of mobs depending on your levels.,grimrock,clk185t,3,t5_2ssew
