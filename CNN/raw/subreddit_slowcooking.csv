I posted a recipe for lamb breast not long ago which I braised in water onion garlic and rosemary. Five hours later the water had turned into tasty lamby liquid.If you dont want to substitute chicken stock with water how about switching to veg stock?

2252835,0,t3_2kz0mt,I use cooked chicken every week in either a slow cooker lasagna or Mexican taco lasagna. I highly recommend both. Pretty much the ingredients you expect and even if you cheapout on stuff they come out amazing with plenty left over for lunches or dinners for the week.  hours on low with all the fixings. Both recipes and variations found online. Im on an iPad right now so bit tough but Ill try and find a link to good ones and edit this. comes out to . or less per serving. Either one. Found! Ignore the branding on this one but here is a starter for slow cooker lasagna just use your chicken instead of beef and I added one large onion to the mix and had some turkey pepperoni that I layered in... was amazing. We are still eating it off and I have several lunches for later. I also did not add an egg.This looks very similar to what I do with Mexican taco lasagna I buy stewed and diced  ounce cans when theyre on sale and use those in a pinch to make the whole thing more cost effective. Also freezes like a dream. Instead of sour cream mixed in with the chicken layers I use Greek yogurt fage full fat as an extra kick. Also I add canned chilis.

Your shopping list can just be the ingredients for the recipe. Especially when you are starting out you wont have a lot of different spices or other ingredients yet. Normal recipes might call for four or five different spices and the cost really adds up if you have to buy them all for one recipe. The  ingredient recipes let you start making delicious food without a big initial investment.

3245039,0,t3_2x9vs4,In my experience and understanding no.Im not entirely sure if what Im about to say is technically correct but my way of thinking is that you marinate to get flavor in. Cooking it basically submerged in liquid is going take the marinade out and replace it with the cooking liquid. So instead flavor the heck out of your liquid. Slow cooking of any kind not just crock pots require more herbs and seasonings in the goo youre cooking in liquid or in a rub if youre dry slow cooking. If a recipe calls for a tbs of garlic powder or whatever and youre slow cooking it it will disappear. Ive found you need x more herbs and seasonings than normal cooking methods.Salt and fat affect the flavors the most so always make sure to salt well at the end last  minutes and if youre slow cooking something very lean add some sort of fat to the process olive oil butter coconut oil whatever.,slowcooking,coycu68,1,t5_2s64w

I went from being freaked out by these little alien structures that bear no resemblance to any other earth plant to needing them inside of me at all times.

5037796,0,t3_3jvpnc,Gumbo is my specialty! My job requires me to move to different cities countries every few years including UK and I have made gumbo all over the world.  I am originally from Houston TX and there is a heavy Cajun influence in my family.  I know This subreddit is for CrockPottype recipes only but you are not doing yourself any justice cooking gumbo in a crock pot.  First the roux this website explains the process very well. I usually do the stove top method but I have had great success with the oven method. My mother just sent me a bottle of Jar Roux  in the mail. I used it this weekend... and it was good.  Ive made better roux myself but I usually spend at least  hours and sometimes I dont have that time to give.  If cooking roux on stovetop  low heat add your bell pepper onion and celery to the chocolate colored roux.  Wait for veggies to cook down and get translucent then add to a gumbo pot with a big can of chicken stock.  Mix in some Louisiana hot sauce  some cajun spices I use Bays and Tony Chachere saltpepper garlic parsley and I like to add a handful of chopped green onion.  Ill the add the sausage and chicken and cook for .   hours. I wish I could type everything I want to say about cooking gumbo because I take it very seriously but Ive had a few beers and its almost midnight.  My family would disown me if they every found out I burned a roux I have twice but thats our secret.Edit To answer your question on roux measurements... I use  cup of Flour and . cup of oil.   A little less oil than you have flour is the perfect amount.  ,slowcooking,cut8v2y,1,t5_2s64w

For instance we are looking into a Jamaican month to shake things up a bit. We are in talks with a supplier from the island to put some special seasonings rubs and sauces in the box. From there we build a couple recipes for you to try. Then you have the leftover specialty products to continue cooking and tinkering with long after Jamaica month is over. After a few months youll have tried some new dishes flavors and products.

Yes there are gazillions of variations and Ive tried a great many of them.But the beans thing is more fundamental. Beans cooked in the chili just dont taste anything like beans cooked by themselves. I prefer the Threadgills recipe but there are many variations on that too. And a certain amount of bean taste also leaks out and changes the chili as it cooks.Mixing the beans into the bowl just before consumption is simply a quite different taste. It would be the equivalent of cooking the rice and the gumbo together.,slowcooking,cxgqgxe,0,t5_2s64w

Likely i bought it from costco and had to portion it ahead of time into friendly  pound slices so i dont have to eat it for weeks.  . run hot water over the shoulder for a bit so the very outside gets thawed out. pat completely dry with a towel.  . get your favorite dry rub i use kinders and rub it thickly onto all of the pork.  . into slow cooker on low. maybe cut an onion into there if you really want but why bother?  . pull shoulder out after  hours or whenever you damn well please. shred.  . mix with bbq sauce save for later use as you see fit. whatever. ingredients the shoulder the rub and the sauce. thats all it takes man. and maybe cheese on your sandwich if thats how you roll. ,slowcooking,d0yy6df,-2,t5_2s64w

7073370,0,t3_4cgpjs,I like making Thai Red Curry. Very versatile so you can tailor it to what your family likes.Thai red curryBasically you will load your slow cooker with veggies amp spiced meat and cover that with coconut milk. All amounts below are very variable  depends on size of your cooker and such. The sesame oil and rice wine vinegar go easy on those or leave out if you are not experienced with those.  little jars of red curry paste  only for mild  tb of sesame oil  tb rice wine vinegar  tb soy sauce or fish sauce Salt amp pepper to taste  tb sriracha leave out if you want it milder   cans coconut milk can replace some of this with chicken broth if desired  lbs chicken cubed   lbs misc cubed veggies of your choice Potatoes daikon makes a nice potato substitute if you cant eat potatoes mushrooms little pearl onions or just diced onion broccoli zucchini carrot bell peppers parsnips etc are all good. The last one I made was chicken onions carrots mushrooms and red bell pepper. My favorite so far.Salt amp pepper the meat amp cook it in a pan until you are not seeing much pink any more then toss in the red curry paste to get it fragrant. Dump that and all veggies in crock pot. Make sure to really get all liquid out of that pan. Cover everything with coconut milk and chicken broth if desired. You can skip the pan browning step if you prefer not dirtying another pan. But I really recommend it. If you dont make sure to stir in the red curry paste into the coconut milk well.Low for  hours usually does it. I usually open it once in the last few hours past when chicken would be safe obviously to stir once and check the salt and spicey level so I can adjust if needed.

Its right around  degrees. On the low setting the time it takes to reach the simmer point is around seven to eight hours. For the high setting it takes around three to four hours.The food will cook a little differently by starting on low and moving to high eventually because the temps would be different over time. This also implies cooking for  hours on high then moving to low for  hours like uruok mentions below would be slightly different as well. You wouldnt quite reach that simmer point in the first  hours on high but then changing to low would increase the amount of time youre keeping it slightly below that simmer point.TLDR Temperature control over time.,slowcooking,d3rei7w,27,t5_2s64w

7945044,0,t3_4o25p0,Ive made this a few times    Cooking chicken low amp slow typically allows the chicken to break down from the liquids in the pot. Ive done this recipe on both high and low settings  the high setting typically allows for more cutting into fajita strips and the low setting is better if you want pulled chicken it will be very wet and fall apart if you try to cut with a knife.  Also you dont necessarily have to let something sit in there for as long as the recipe requires  keep a closer eye on the chicken and pull it out when its been fully cooked.  Also try draining the meat through some kind of strainer after youre done instead of taking directly out of slowcooker and placing on to your plate.,slowcooking,d493igb,5,t5_2s64w

8388488,0,t3_4ugtbn,The biggest problem with slow cooking is that is gives pretty much everything in the pot the uniform soft mushy texture throughout. The best way to counter this is some sort of postprocessing after allowing the slow cooker to make your food tender. One of the best ways to do this is to either sear on the stove or broil in the oven. This will give some caramelization which will give whatever youre searing  broiling a more distinct flavor since the temperatures in the crockpot are too low and slow to quickly caramelize most foods well but more importantly a different texture. Too many recipes result in a uniform texture and taste which is pretty gross for multiple meals so finding things to add later to give some texture variations will go a long way. ,slowcooking,d5q3x51,1,t5_2s64w

Chicken Meatballs in Thai Coconut Curry the meat was bland and I dont think I trimmed the lemongrass properly because it was kind of crunchy? Sticky Chicken Thighs with Apricots really tasty maybe our favorite... Honey Mustard Pork Tenderloin the brussels sprouts were kind of soggy meat was okay but I wish I had braised before putting it int the slow cooker. Sesame Chicken Wings these were really good I put them on a baking sheet and braised each side for about  minutes which MASSIVELY helped the flavor.So three successes out of five!

We tolerate some extremely messy and cross contaminated meat processing practices in exchange for cheap meat because we assume the inevitable pathogen contamination that occurs will be minimized through refrigeration and eliminated in cooking.Yes the risk is far lower in steaks vs ground meat were bacteria are spread throughout the product and for very competent butchers who prevent most contamination through safe processing.Finally once you are informed of the risks its up to you if you want to take risks you feel are worth it! The FDAs job is to minimize illness from food borne pathogens and again they manage a significant portion of that through consumer education getting us to fully cook meat rather than trying to totally eradicate contamination in processing which would be expensive. ,slowcooking,deov74d,6,t5_2s64w

We have made bulk meatballs pot roasts carnitas chicken tacos steak fajitas curries sweet and sour chicken etc. we plop the bagged contents into our slow cooker to cook. We always have a stash of frozen veggies. The only things we dont freeze are potatoes pasta and rice.

11532057,0,t3_64k9eu,I find that if I dont drain somethings it adds unwanted liquid later in cooking or can create a different texture.For example drain fat. Unless you want all of it in there which sometimes I do too much can make something feel slick or too rich. I tend to drain any dicedcut vegetables but only if the end result will be too liquidy. If not I will leave it in. ,slowcooking,dg35spa,2,t5_2s64w

11541746,0,t3_64qrsd,It really depends on what cut they came from be it loin or shoulder or whatnot.  Most times the country style ribs thing is a generic name for x strips of random pork cuts they needed to get rid of.When I find them made out of shoulder I just marinate overnight or as long as I wish in cheapo zesty italian dressing and then drain and throw them in the crock pot with seasoning til shreddy.  Usually takes about  hours.If its loin then Ill do the same marinating but grill em instead.  If I recently did the zesty italian or feel fancy then Ill do a bourbonbrown sugarcider vinegar marinade,slowcooking,dg49bjj,2,t5_2s64w

11599263,0,t1_dg9l9cl,The danger zone? Ahhhhhhh i get enough fearmongering on CNN and Fox News I dont need it in my food. The food was cooked. It was fine to eat. It was then kept on warm. It continued to be fine. At what point would this food go from safe to unsafe?A huge colony of norovirus or staph or salmonella did not grow on this food as it sat on warm. These food poisoning statistics would come overwhelming from food that was never fully cooked in the first place. The entire salmonella category would be uncooked food. This crookpot of food was cooked. Norovirus is spread by feces mostly unwashed foods or by unwashed hands. Right there  of your CDC illness stats dont apply to this situation. I dunno where you get your thousands of Americans die from food poisoning stat. The CDC site looks like roughly  not thousands. More fearmongering. And btw the top two causes of death from food poisoning according to your own site are salmonella from uncooked food this situation doesnt apply to that and Toxoplasmosis which is caused by a parasite also would not apply to this situation.Stop spreading the fearmongering. ,slowcooking,dgas9v1,2,t5_2s64w

Not only did I get my smoked paprika for a steal I also discovered how good most spices can be when fresh. You havent had sage until you get the good stuff. Its fluffy almost like brittle cotton.
