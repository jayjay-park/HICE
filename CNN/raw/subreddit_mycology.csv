419451,0,t3_1yugmj,I think the crux here is defining the quantity to consume. As Paracelsus has been quoted to say All things are poison and nothing is without poison only the dose permits something not to be poisonous.This can be best illustrated by the fact that there is a safe dosage amount of arsenic that a person can consume without noticing any ill effect although that amount is tiny. Hells a miniscule amount of arsenic is actually needed by the body to maintain function.  And on the other side of this coin there is a dosage of water that is deemed poisonous and Im not talking about drowning.So by this logic you can actually eat ALL molds. Its just a question of how much.,mycology,cfo8pl5,1,t5_2qu6q

1074829,0,t3_26f6mj,I took these photos today. The first four photos are a collection found in grass under a maple tree at a farm. The last two were found among what I think are liverworts in an urban area. Im fairly sure the first collection is a coprinus species as evidenced by the last photo which was taken about  minutes after picking and they had already begun to decay into ink. Their smell was very sweet and buttery. The only thing similar I could easily find in an ID book is C. micaceus but while the texture and coloring is similar these caps did not have folds so its not micaceus. Any ideas what the ID could be? The second collection had white gills. I was unable to take a spore print. I dont have any guesses as to genus. Thanks reddit! ,mycology,chqgmus,1,t5_2qu6q

2325231,0,t1_clybcpj,I wrote up a really long description of this once but I cant find it in my history. Here we go again!Step  Pick up some gladware containers. Grab some corrugated cardboard cut into pieces that will fit into container. Put cardboard in gladware pour boiling water overtop and fill the gladware container. Put something with weight on top of the cardboard so they get submerged and are pasteurizedsanitized by the boiling water. Let sit for  minutes. Id also recommend submerging the lid in a shallow try and pouring boiling water over it so that all parts get pasteurized.Step  Pour the hot water out of the tupperware set the pieces of cardboard on top of the newly pasteurized lid you want to prevent them from touching contaminated surfaces and begin separating the cardboard. The cardboard comes apart like a weird papery lasagna. You basically only want the wavy layer in the middle. However youre going to take the first couple sheets of the smooth layer or however many are required crumple them into lightly packed balls and put those on the bottom of the tupperware.  Their purpose is to provide a spacer in between the wavy layers of cardboard which the mushrooms will be on and the bottom. You want this because excess moisture will collect in the bottom and you dont want the stem butts sitting right in the water or theyll go bad on you quickly.Step  Take your kit and cut a flush of mushrooms off as close to the base as you can. Theres healthy mycelium here that were going to run on the cardboard. Step  Take a layer of wavy cardboard and place in the tupperware. Now cut up a few pieces from the base of your mushroom and put them on the cardboard put another piece of wavy cardboard on and repeat. Youre making a weird cardboardstembutt lasagna. Step  Once youve ran out of mushroom pieces seal the container place somewhere dark. Dont open for the first couple days. After a couple days youll want to open the container briefly to exchange CO for oxygen and then close it back up. Do that daily.Step  Once youve fully colonized the cardboard youre going to transfer it to coffee grounds by making a lasagna of coffee grounds and cardboard in another clean container. Check other sources for how to prepare and store grounds for use.There you go. My results with fresh mushrooms from kits were really good. My results from store bought were spotty. Maybe  worked. Freshness is key. edit In case anyone is wondering why you start on cardboard and not directly on coffee grounds I looked that up once. Its because the cardboard isnt nutritious. It takes longer for mold to grow on it because theres not much there to eat and theres not too many molds that specialize in cardboard. The mushrooms are much better at eating the cardboard so they colonize it before the mold can. You need to transfer it to the coffee grounds because there isnt enough nutrition in the cardboard for it to produce any significant fruit,mycology,clz41xa,3,t5_2qu6q

2705935,0,t1_cnbma4m,I see the last two are the same now.If youre trying to identify them then its sometimes necessary to pull them up. Most mushrooms go unnoticed due to their small size and will be beyond recognition in a week so I wouldnt worry too much about spoiling it for everyone else. In certain cases like if that bright A. muscaria popped up in a public garden then I would leave because it looks nice and people are going to see it.When taking pictures of mushrooms  stay zoomed out and try to move the camera closer or further and  dont shoot in direct sunlight. When you zoom in one thing is usually in focus and everything else in front or behind it is blurry. Direct sunlight is too bright and washes out your picture trying standing so your shadow covers the mushroom and there should be enough ambient light to give you a clear picture.Going out and finding them is the best way to learn and its a lot of fun. You learn the characteristics of certain families genera and species and before you know it you can land a pretty accurate guess on most of your finds.Ill update my original post to include some of the characteristics that helped me ID some of your finds.,mycology,cnbnkob,2,t5_2qu6q

Lepiota unqualified is a trick name  has two meanings distinguished by extra letters. One is Lepiota s.l. sensu lato  the broader definition a stillstanding synonym of Macrolepiota amp other segregate lepiotoid genera proposed later  often for species already known originally called Lepiota. Newer names are often preferred but  Lepiota procera older name of Macrolepiota procera  remains a valid synonym still a good name in mycologese.Lepiota sensu stricto Lepiota s.str.  is the narrower reference whats left of Lepiota s.l. the fewer species remaining  after others have all been removed reassigned to segregate Macro and Leuco genera etc.. Your mushroom and reference implied above distinct from Macrolep  Lepiota s.str.The concentric scaly cap however macroleplooking is typical in some Lepiota s.str. other lepiotoids too. The form of the annulus is perhaps the most important feature and your picture shows that key detail nicely.  Its very different in Macrolepiota and Chlorophyllum thick with unique structural detail edge especially.Its a good mistake for learning not to make. Your picture could be one of the worlds deadliest mushrooms from what Im seeing. Good thing there arent as many poisoning cases by that thing as by death caps or destroying angels. Because survival rates for the latter so famous for being so deadly  are pretty happygolucky compared to Lepiota s.str. cases few as they are    mortality. Same toxins.

3934921,0,t1_cr4q5mi,Its unlikely someone will die without special circumstances but when talking about if a mushroom is toxicpoisonous we talk about the mushrooms ability to cause poisoningintoxicationdamage though damage might not result directly from the psilocin alone or without repeated exposure.When people do get really sick from psilocin psilocybin is not psychoactive it is a prodrug for psilocin consumption it is often because it results in serotonin syndrome. Many chemicals can cause serotonin syndrome and serotonin syndrome is primarily harmful because of a release of endogenous chemicals stimulated by something ingested or a lack of their elimination.Psilocin does not strictly act like serotonin it acts like psilocin in an environment where none occurs naturally. If it were the same chemical your body is adapted to handle it would not cause the cascade of neurotransmitters and symptoms that it does. The ingestion causes the improper function of normal systems. This is poisoning enjoyable or not.,mycology,cr4tdzc,1,t5_2qu6q

6674045,0,t3_471zat,Im also a coder and a fan of foraging for wild edible mushrooms.  Ive thought about this many times...The would be great to have a mobile app that would allow you to record your finds capturing GPS location allowing you to find the same spot next year datetime weather data for that location at that date and time and also the preceding couple weeks of weather data for that location.If the data location and weather were cross referenced with types of mushrooms found and their known fruiting triggers temp humidity etc it would allow for a predictive analysis in the future.  So the app could alert with things like Highly likely that morel patch  is currently fruitingFurther with lots of users the knowledge gleaned from the data could flow in the other direction improving what is known or thought to be known about what makes which mushrooms flush for the mycological community at large.Of course most wild edible foragers will take some coaxing before they enter the GPS locations of their best spots into an online database so youd have real work to do building trust before youd have too many people willing to use it...,mycology,d09nk0m,5,t5_2qu6q

6734844,0,t1_d0fsus1,Depends on the fungus but in this case they grow towards the light so that they can disperse spores away from the dung pile. For many dung fungi they need to get spores on or into plants so that they can complete the lifecycle. Many herbivores have what is called a zone of repugnance where they wont eat within a certain distance of dung for obvious reasons. So many dung fungi send sporodochia up and out away from the dung pile and then eject spores violently so that they get far away enough from the dung to be ingested by the next herbivore that comes along. Other fungi have similar strategies like some from the Sordaria genus which form little cannon perithecia on the surface of dung and then eject spores towards the sun. Good BBC program about the Mucorales has some more info. You can read and I think watch some here  ,mycology,d0fxwnr,6,t5_2qu6q

Also Panaeolus will have dark mottled gills which are marginate these are solid brown also the gills will be adenexed to adenate rather than adenate to subdecurrent.

8663602,0,t3_4ykpm7,Fellow alaskan mushroom hunter here!disclaimer i am not an expert and  are definitely amanitas The red one is an immature amanita muscaria or fly agaric. Tons of info on these guys out there very common. The white one is a different amanita im not sure which. Beautiful mushrooms DEFINITELY DONT EAT them though. Fly agarics wont kill you but will not make you feel good. They do have some psychoactive properties not psilocybin generally not worth it likely will make you sick. Some amanitas will kill you. is a bolete i believe its a boletus auripes or butterfoot bolete. Boletes generally are edible especially in alaska as we dont get the poisonous varieties as far as i know. Boletes tend to get bugs and maggots in them once they get big so always check for that. Boletus edulis or King boletes are the best boletes for eating and we do get those up here. is some variety of puffball you can eat those when they are young and their insides are still firm and completely white those pictured look like they have already begun to mature. the insides will start to turn yellow and then olive green get mushy and finally turn into a powder of spores that puff out when you squeeze it. is known as iqmik by indigenous folk here in alaska they burn it and mix the ashes with chewing tobacco which enhances the nicotine absorption.Not sure about everything else i am fairly certain that  is angel wings which are edible but bland from what I hear. a couple things pictured are lichen i believe which is technically part fungus.Always make sure you have a  positive identification down to the species and thoroughly cook anything before eating it. Also start by sampling a small amount as some people react to fungi differently and may get sick when most people dont or have an allergic reaction. Avoid mixing with alcohol as some mushrooms become poisonous if alcohol is in your systemedit to be more helpful in the future if you continue to hunt make sure to get good shots of both the cap and underside and take note of any color changes which occur when the flesh is cut or bruised. Take a sporeprint as well if you end up taking it home.,mycology,d6okgxk,2,t5_2qu6q

11480773,0,t1_dfxa7gm,Yes.  I encourage you to look at images further but the two basic requirements are that your morel is going to be actually honeycombed rather than wavy and also is going to be hollow inside rather than solid.  As for the latter I encourage you to slice them in half longitudinally anyway just to make sure you empty the center of debrisbugs.,mycology,dfxcclv,11,t5_2qu6q
11528222,0,t3_64h5as,OP is this from an old grow you tossed outside or did you find this in the wild? Because those look pretty young to be so determinative of a psilocybe.Can you elaborate your reasons for ID?,mycology,dg2q54q,4,t5_2qu6q
11531945,0,t1_dg2ufpm,Surprisingly enough I had a similar experience that forced me to change up the way I build.I did the go outside pick local plants and fauna. Sadly my terrarium got bad spider mites! I grow Cannabis for medication after my chemo treatment spider mites will kill cannabis!The thought of starving because of my love of bringing the outside indoors made me switch up to domesticated bland sterile components and it sprouts mushrooms Im just lucky I guess!,mycology,dg35c9b,1,t5_2qu6q

11686053,0,t1_dgkel3e,These truffles develop a strong aroma when ripe that is similar in some ways to some of the Tuber species despite being a basidiomycete.  Thats so that animals can find them when their spores are ripe in order for their evolved spore dispersal scheme to happen naturally. Its unlikely that youll accidentally find one when its ripe  and once detached from its mycelial body  they can no longer grow  and the unripe spores are never going to germinate.  Once you remove the truffle from the ground youve effectively interrupted its life cycle because it involves animals seeking their scent in order to spread the spores via scatpellets. Its not that big of a deal  but something to think about. ,mycology,dgkmqz2,20,t5_2qu6q
