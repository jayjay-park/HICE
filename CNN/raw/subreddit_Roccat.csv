5787857,0,t3_3uelpv,I had the same problem.  This is what I did and it got fixed.  In advanced setting there is a reset to defaults option click that.  Then I close Swam from the system tray.  Next I deleted Swarm Folder in DocumentsRoccat. After i reopened swarm the Game Profile section was populated.  I would backup that Folder first just in case.  Not sure if this will work for you.,Roccat,cxejdva,3,t5_2tete

6665757,0,t1_d08qzjx,I have the Kone pure not the optical. I know how to get the drivers specifically for the one that I have. The driver that populates when I search for them on the site is this one.... ROCCATKonePureDRV.FW..zip which I believe to be the right one. If you come up with a different suggestion by all means let me know.,Roccat,d08spbm,1,t5_2tete

9836269,0,t3_5fij2b,I am the one that recently bought Kova and had problems with Talk in combination with my Ryos Mk. So besides still having the problem that EasyShift only works in one direction now Talk stopped working completely as in the tray icon flashing between blue and red. I am pretty sure this happened after I installed the latest version of Swarm .. Is the previous version available somewhere?,Roccat,daposfr,1,t5_2tete
