Also make sure the clothes you are wearing are from goodwill and scratch the serial number off the gun you have a friend purchase for you. Then walk up to his front door knock and shoot him twice in the head then walk awaydont run get in your carfalse license plate and drive away. Reach a distance of  miles away from the scene and bury the gloves and dump fuel all over your clothes mask and fake license place. Then burn them with a lighter. If police come you immediately invoke the th if arrested or request an attorney if they just wish to question you. As illegal advice cannot be offered in this subreddit this is all a complete work of fiction and I obviously would not or could not endorse the murder of another human being.

4428430,0,t1_csolr2s,He plead guilty.He is saying in his appeal that he did not know what he was pleading to and first that his attorney did not explore the options with him. Then later he said that he brought up entrapment his attorney said it didnt apply and that was reason for ineffective assistance of counsel.I get it IAC is something everybody serving time in jail tries  because they have a whole lot of time to read books about law without a basic understanding of how to read laws or check with cases to make sure theyre even still good. And thats their right. Also they have nothing better to do. That being said the bar for IAC is pretty high. Its not enough to say that your lawyer is an idiot you also have to say that the case would have turned out completely different if your attorney had been an idiot. Maybe his public defender was an idiot  but if he was it was because he didnt cover his ass. If his client is that adamant that this was entrapment let him have his trial. Its a loser everyone knows its a loser because this isnt even close to entrapment but ultimately you do have to defer to your clients wishes. The best you can do is try to talk them out of it.

Either the servers accept less money than they want or the restaurant goes out of business.  If the business can afford it but doesnt want to I think its reasonable for the servers to ask for higher wages within the framework of how the restaurant treats them.  I think its also reasonable for the restaurant to counter with an offer of guaranteed hours.  But I think its more reasonable for the servers to request a raise than for the servers to request that the business change the way they operate.Fundamentally I agree with you that the optimal solution is probably for the business to change the way they operate but I dont think thats the best request for the servers to make.,bestoflegaladvice,ct0tv40,3,t5_34iym

Even the worst asshole  year old boy will know that that was abuse unless op explained it really really badly. Also the fact that she even had a boyfriend for a year with a dad like that is highly improbable. Tons of normal dads dont let  year old girls date let alone abusive ones. Usually abusive people are extremely controlling and would never let someone get that close to the person they are abusing especially not if they were potentially stealing sex from them. Granted op could have hidden the boyfriend from her dad but I find that also hard to believe with an abusive person.

5212571,0,t1_cvdw2qk,Any reasonable person would certainly perceive the threat to publish private nudes as a threat.The subjective ambiguity is more like whether for example a participant in a business negotiation should take seriously something like say I swear I will crucify you if you try to backdoor me on this deal. Nobody literally believes a colleague will nail them to a cross the questionsubjective ambiguity lies in how we interpret the statement which being figurative is vague ambiguous and situationdependent.There is no such ambiguity in the source. The threat to publish nude photos was a literal and explicit threat to do exactly what it said. No reasonable person would think otherwise and the harm is the release of nude photos no reasonable person could conclude that he was offering to publish them as a favor for example. ,bestoflegaladvice,cveb3e6,6,t5_34iym

6074643,0,t1_cyfv797,gtYou have now responded at least ten times and not once have you offered even a guess as to why the mother would take the father off the list of approved people while failing to notify the teachers. Im starting to guess that you have little to no experience with children and schools. Most schools have hundreds of children. Even if they only had prek to  they probably have at least  students if not more. Thats assuming one class each year with  kids.The teachers cannot be expected to remember all the fiddly little details of who has custody and who can see the kids who has a peanut allergy and cant go to a friends house who has the mother who doesnt want her precious baby going home with Uncle Joe who hasnt been to church in ten years etc etc for all  or whatever. So the schools came up with a simple solution make a list put people on it who can take the kids. Thats it thats all.There is one required step here make sure father is not on list. This step was completed. Thats really all thats necessary. On top of that OP said in one of his comments that the guy told the teacher that he was in a hurry and would go to the office on the way out. All she had to do was say that she would accompany him and all of this would likely be avoided. But she didnt because she was slacking or oblivious who knows. She is still at fault no matter how you try and twist the situation and harp on and on and on about the restraining order that is irrelevant to the release policy of the school. ,bestoflegaladvice,cyfveh3,9,t5_34iym

9813916,0,t1_damotzo,gt Im referencing the American Academy of Paediatrics position that ATVs are dangerous for under s. Also from your source The CPSC industry and many consumer advocates recommend that children ages  through  not ride ATVs with engines larger than  ccs.In other words other prosafety organizations including the federal government in the form of the CPSC believe that its okay to let children younger than  ride smaller ATVs.gt Contrary to popular believe one does not have to provide a link in order to reference a source.Its also bad form to say that the peak medical body agrees with me and fail to elaborate. How the hell was I supposed to know that you were referring to the American Academy of Paediatrics rather than for example the AMA or the New England Journal of Medicine or some other source?gtAs to your second point no I dont believe that is the case seeing as if you look at the statistics whilst overall injuries and deaths associated with ATVs have declined those related to children riding ATVs have risen.First of all your source notes that the change in injury rates is not statistically significant. Second if the injury rate of children playing baseball goes up while the injury rate of adults playing baseball goes down does that mean baseball is inherently too dangerous for children to play? Of course not. It could mean that kids are playing baseball differently and there could be steps available to mitigate the risk. In fact your source includes a statement by a representative of the Consumer Federation of America which says that ATVs should be constructed to be safer not banned for children altogether.gtWe dont even allow kids to ride the bloody things down here and they are still involved with . of all non intentional deaths in AustraliaThat figure doesnt refer to kids at all its actually . percent of all nonintentional traumatic deaths in Australia of thosewhose occupation was farm manager or agricultural worker between . According to your source only  children under  were killed in ATVrelated accidents over a  and a half year period . Lets call it . deaths per year on average during that time range. According to an Australian Bureau of Statistics spreadsheet there were  and  deaths of children age  in Australia in  and  respectively. In other words ATVs are implicated in about . of all childrens deaths in Australia.And Id appreciate a source for the fact that its illegal for kids to drive ATVs down there. The most I could find was that your FCAI mandates warning labels saying that they should only be used by people  not that its actually prohibited.gtdont kid yourself that letting them ride an ATV is fine all the evidence shows otherwise.The evidence shows that there is some level of risk to allowing kids to drive ATVs and that the risk is decreased with certain safety measures. Different parents are okay with different levels of risk.As a final note I notice that you didnt address a few parts of my post. Do you think its possible that the AAP is erring on the side of caution? Do you think the AAP should recommend that yearolds not get learners permits or otherwise learn to drive cars at that age? ,bestoflegaladvice,damrwn3,4,t5_34iym

Attorneys cannot testify and thats what youre suggesting.On summation the attorney  having laid foundation  can draw inferences for the trieroffact for all we know she made this all up... but not introduce complete alternative scenarios.You also seem to think that the OP could get through a civil case  where there is no right not to take the stand  without being put directly to the question  Did you have sex with her in lieu of rent?OP would either reply honestly or take the th  not by refusing to take the stand but on the stand openly in court say I am unable to answer that question on the grounds that it may incriminate me or however the cool kids do it these days.AT THAT POINT the attorney who has been insinuating that shes lying loses all credibility with the trieroffact.  Defendant gets whatever favorable outcome she can.  In California for example if she claims that she refused and hes evicting her only on the basis of wanting it to continue OP could conceivably get dismissed with prejudice and a  day bar on refiling.I think the winning play  cheapest in the long run  is Heres  in relocation assistance.

10431979,0,t3_5peh1l,OPgt At a store I was at LP thought I was shoplifting and grabbed my arm as I was leaving. I reacted not thinking and punched him and that made him bleed from the mouth heavily. He was plainclothes so I thought he was some random dude trying to jump me and I drew a utility knife. I work in construction.gt By this time the other LP were there which I had not notice. They saw me with the knife and saw blood on first LP. I still didnt realize they were LP for some reason so I ran and tripped because panicking. They thought I cut the first LP and thats why he was bleeding so cops were called saying I was knifing people. The guys chasing me caught up because I tripped and started kicking me in the face and stomped on my arm that was holding the knife. This actually broke my arm. We heard police sirens so they froze for a second and I thought the police were called because someone saw them assaulting me and reported them so I picked up the knife with other hand and got up quickly. As I was getting up the knife scraped one guy on his side. Im talking like a cat scratch. But it looks and now because police see me with blood on my hands and my face and holding a knife. I almost get tazed when I try to explain the situation to them. And I was so confused because I still had not realized that they were LP because I was not shoplifting.gt This was interpreted as arguing with the police because I was very upset because they assaulted me and I was getting arrested. So along with assault second degree I get resisting arrest and menacing police because I held the knife towards them. And also my knife it turns out was illegal in my state or area. Im not sure. There werent charges related to that.gt Yeah so this is a clusterfuck of being extremely unlucky but I swear to you that this is what happened and that I am not embellishing or downplaying any of these events.

10482014,0,t1_dcw78gf,Yeah exactly. Assuming that the cops would try and hunt down a  year old and charge him with a felony because he pushed one of them is kind of a stretch. Definitely could happen but unless the thing they got called out there for was pretty heinous in the first place I imagine they would be more likely to try and cut the kid a break. Even the kids friend who he said was throwing punches might not get the assault charge. Kids do stupid shit and cops were all kids once. My brother just became an officer and he was a crazy son of a bitch when he was younger. Hate to say it but when the kid said something about nobody in the sub having any actual experience dealing with cops he might have had a bit of a point.

10564343,0,t3_5r97hl,When my mother lived in a rural part of California she had a cat adopt her.  Apparently the neighbors  mi away moved out and abandoned the cat.  He was a badass  likely part maine coon polydactyl long thick hair big square head and about lbs of lean body weight.He disappeared for a month and came back with a shattered hip.  Xray showed a . cal bullet.  Had to have the leg amputated but he never really missed it and was still the best mouser ever.Word got back that he was seen once too often in someones chicken coop.  Thats legit.There would be no hard feelings this is going to sound strange if the shooter had finished the job.  But there is no way this cat ran away from having his hip shattered by a bullet.  You left it there to die motherfucker.My point is that if OPs livestock is in jeopardy hed be morally and most likely legally justified in just shooting the dogs  after warning its owners.   A pellet gun or potentially nonlethal bullet is a horrible idea. Kill it.  Or dont shoot it.Cats name was Tweety which was a dumb name.  After being gone for a month he scratched at the door meowed when I opened it  like hey bro.  tsup?  Hopped over to the couch and cuddled up to my wife and started picking the burrs and stickers out of his fur.  My wife noticed his leg was wonky and could feel bone fragments.  The cat was seriously like What THAT?  Thatll buff right out.  Got any food?  Wife decided that he needed a new name in honor of his utter badassery.  So Tweety became Teddy as in Roosevelt.  About  years later he went missing and we figure a coyote got him.  And before anyone asks there was no chance of this guy becoming an indooronly cat.,bestoflegaladvice,dd5l65p,82,t5_34iym
