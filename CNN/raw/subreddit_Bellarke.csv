If it was still bad maybe she was just doing things wrong!gtBut like.... wouldnt you end up making your hand ache? I mean assuming you have staying power etc and since this is fictionland OF COURSE Bellamy has staying power I think with everything practice makes perfect. Have you seen Bellamys forearms? I also like to imagine Bellamy as an intensely sexual being who likes to practice. Like A Lot.gtP.S. If anyone is wondering what mine and Bubbles PMs look like... see above.PM stands for Porn Messages right?? JK. I should be ashamed of myself. But Im totes not.,Bellarke,d67zsac,3,t5_3ez0y

11019421,0,t1_degb1ad,Yes! Bellamy is the only character who has had to earn his redemption to this extent and its getting really annoying. I dont think any of the other characters have come close. I didnt like how Bellamys decision in x was mostly framed by what he did last season. There are a lot of other reasons for him to save the slaves and its not all about his guilt.I also hope the fake death wasnt just the writers way of getting the Blakes back together. We already know how Bellamy feels about Octavia but it would be nice for Octavia to see how important Bellamy is to her. ,Bellarke,deh0r8y,5,t5_3ez0y

11396426,0,t1_dfleuuf,I really felt the same way about it honestly.  I needed more and throwing the blonde girl in there made me roll my eyes.  Like come on show really?  I mean yeah I get it there are only a few days left before Armageddon and lots of people point out its realistic that people would be boning like bunnies but it really just does nothing for me.  I cant help but feel it takes away from the stories emotional beats.  I guess thats just me?  I swear Im not a prude or anything! LOL  ,Bellarke,dfnrpxh,3,t5_3ez0y
