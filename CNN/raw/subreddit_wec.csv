2996645,0,t1_co8l92d,I think you have to overlook things like the backwards CoTA.  A lot of that was making it up for the average audience and for better camera angles.  The cars arent machinery the LM Nismo will race against either but rather subtle Nissan branding hints.  You can show a fullblown racing stadium that the drivers are entering into from atop the turn  hill like you couldnt coming the normal direction at least definitely not enough for casual watchers to get it albeit with some CGI tweaks.  Which actually makes it more like LeMans than CoTA and is a good thing for their story as becoming World Champions. I felt like the story was told really well and came across pretty clearly despite the cuts.  Felt they were just long enough that you could understand what was happening in each section.  That being said there were a lot of people that seemed to not do so which is surprising.

My brother in law tried a career and he had skills but did not have the money while on the other end weve seen guys with money getting a wheel in F and having no skills at all.,wec,cqdeggh,6,t5_2tr3a

4118166,0,t3_37skgp,Minus the fins and wheel well cutouts I think they look pretty good. And some of the liveries in P arent reaklly that great.The multicolored Porsches look good this year and the retro Nissan adds a good mix. Toyota isnt bad but itd be cool if they split liveries. I would love to see an orangegoldwhite Eneos Toyota. Audi is the least good looking I think. Should have added the red yellow and black highlights of the old factory Rs on a more silver base like the R Ultra with maybe some two tone like the R Plus. Really going to miss the spyders when they go too. Not to mention only four different Ps. The best looking P IMO the Strakka Dome is going to go bye bye. Still dont understand why if an individual constructor wants to make their own chassis they cant do it. Mostly any extra single car cost comes from not being able to split RampD costs between multiple cars.,wec,crpp3i4,2,t5_2tr3a

4132022,0,t1_crr8cf2,I have marshalled a number of amateur rallys. Fuck me do spectators have a death wish. People just dont understand how quickly sit can go wrong but the most surprising thing I ever saw was at a tarmac rally. An Evo nailed the chicane flatout and went wide put two wheels in the dirt and span. The spectators scattered and got out of the way. The car came to a stop where the crowd had been. The moment it moved off everyone went and stood where they had been before because they decided suit doesnt happen twice. As for the spectator area that ended up being a car park... On a rally stage the only safe place is about a mile away from the stage. A car will find its way anywhere. That cant be helped. Thats why spectator areas are not marked with signs to say to stand there only to say that motorsport is dangerous. We will only ever tell people where not to stand. And even that can be a problem. People having a nice day out dont like to be told what they cannot do. If they want to try and stand somewhere that will. Though Portugal and Pikes Peak are notorious for people getting too close. There is footage of people at Pikes Peak laid on the entrance or apex to a corner reaching out to try and touch the car. I believe one year Seb Loeb got to the end of a stage in Portugal to find a severed hand on the front of his car. ,wec,crr9vzs,66,t5_2tr3a

Theyll definitely not be coming back with the current design that seems very certain. I was really hoping to see how that car would develop over the next  seasons and it was nice to see another big Japanese company in the mix alongside Toyota but they apparently do not think theres enough room for improvement to be worth continuing with the current car.On the other hand the company has a really consistent history in Sports Cars with the Z and Z and then with the Skyline.

6869354,0,t1_d0uj205,Nope it was slower than the Porsches lowdrag configuration at both Spa and Le Mans. At Spa the Porsches were averaging  through the trap and the Audis averaging  the Porsches reaching a highest of  and the Audi reaching a highest of .At Le Mans the Porsches averaged  at the first Mulsanne chicane trap while the Audis averaged just over . However the highest recorded trap was  for Porsche and  for Audi which is perhaps more representative of where they would be if they werent lifting and coasting.The Audi would technically have a higher top speed if allowed to accelerate long enough just due to its higher ICE power since it has more fuel flow from being in a lower hybrid class. On a shorter straight where acceleration matters more the Porsche has the advantage from its hybrid power.The Audis aero was more efficient in that it generated more downforce from a given amount of drag but I wouldnt necessarily say it had less drag in absolute terms.,wec,d0uyalk,1,t5_2tr3a

7896485,0,t3_4ng3s6,This will be my th year going to Le Mans and it is awesome! Bring some good shoes because from Beausejour its a long walk to the startfinish line amp the village. Also bring a radio because you have radio coverage the whole weekend on Radio le Mans in English.  On Friday you have the opportunity to go for a pit walk. Every team is working on the cars which is nice to see. Friday is also the day you want to take a taxi to the town centre of Le Mans because of the drivers parade. we always take a taxi by the front entrance of the circuit  also pubs beer and football P For food bring a bbq or something. For groceries we go to Arnage where u have a Super U. With your campsite you are pretty close to the Porsche corners so i would recommend you check that out. We usually watch the start of the race near te Dunlop Bridge. At night we like to go to Tertre Rouge. Thats just past the Dunlop bridge. Other than that just have fun.

7994541,0,t3_4onw9k,He may have not been someone I followed very closely but I knew of him enough that he was quite a race car driver.But regardless of who I know of or dont it was painful to hear of his fatality.  was the first race where I had been witness to an actual loss of life. Most cases where there had been a loss of life of a series I was following most times due to situations beyond my control Id have to watch a race later or find out about things after the fact.It has come close but not for want of seeing a fatality such as Spa  when the first thing I tune into is Tomas Enges wreck and me being reminded of Senna even though it would be years until I had a chance to see that actual video but read enough on the incident to be concerend if there would be a repeat. Never mind that at least three other drivers had died either in testing or during an actual race that also hit me hard including Dale Senior. Prior to his passing I was looking forward to the GT Pro and AM battles hoping everybody gave their all And again Im a vette fan BUT I like competition and Im fully aware that while the vetttes dont always win or even perform well I give them props for keeping at it. After that part of me was hoping Aston Martin would take the win but in another sense...part of me wasnt sure if it would be right among other conflicting feelings.I do hope this years race does turn out safely and its something how you were able to meet the guy.

8378850,1,t3_4udz8f,Is it just me or was Race Control a little AntiPorsche biased in this one? It seems Porsche got penalties for every nittygrittyshit while Lotterers dick move was not even considered for being under investigation?I love Lotterer he is the best sportscar driver in the world right now but that move in the tight left hand corner against the  Porsche was pretty shitty in my opinion. He would have never made that turn if the Porsche was not there to be used as a bumper. And this was not even under investigation.Yet the Porsches got penalties for absolutely everything. What was it with the BlackOrange flag in the end for coming in to repair the rear end? Are you kidding me? There was just a small cable hanging loose no body parts at all. Jesus this is endurance racing all the cars look like shit in the end. BlackOrange should be waved if you are loosing fluids or if carbon parts are hanging loose thus being a danger for other cars on the track. So Race Control took away a potential fight for third place between the Audi and the Porsche in the last hour. Thank you very much.And what was it about all those full course yellows for every little incident somewhere on the track? Since when do we have FCY for a single car sitting in the gravel somewhere?Too much influence by Race Control on the total race outcome for my taste.,wec,d5owle3,-1,t5_2tr3a

The issue is when youve pitted just before one comes out and unless they force everyone to stay out until the track goes back to green I dont see what they can do. The only other option would be to introduce a slow zone policy like they have at Le Mans and never use a safety car or VSC although even that would have an effect on gaps depending when people pitted.I dont buy that it lost Audi the race at CoTA either reliability cost them that.,wec,d8ouyt9,7,t5_2tr3a

10197986,0,t1_dbzrrsy,Im curious to see these numbers and conclusions in the light of the tracks used.  I suspect that the FIA had a more difficult time due to the greater variability in tracks as far as what they cater to.  I cant imagine IMSA had to balance cars around anything as extremely top speed oriented as Le Mans for example.  The result may have been that the WEC tracks were not only more varied racetorace but some also amplified certain types of advantages like outright speed total downforce or pure mechanical grip.   I dont know but I can see these having a big impact if the variation is as much as I think it is.  ,wec,dbzzy9b,1,t5_2tr3a

10228550,0,t1_dc3ekza,gt You do understand that all teams agreed upon letting Ferrari getting a bigger slice. I assume you mean they all signed the Concorde Agreement with this provision. This doesnt mean they agree with or like it nor does it change the fact that Ferrari get this payment only because they threatened to form a breakaway series in  in reaction to costcapping measures which were the only reason teams like Manor joined the series in the first place.gt On top of that the payout system works out pretty well. Its to prevent a team from showing up winning prize money and then leaving.Id argue that F vetting teams before allowing them entry and delaying yearend payments by a year do an effective job of that already.What the payout system succeeds at doing is putting teams out of business Manor twice both Lotus teams and HRT with Sauber in dire straits as well and increasing the number of pay drivers who get race seats ahead of more talented drivers who also bring funding but less of it.,wec,dc3gozi,7,t5_2tr3a
