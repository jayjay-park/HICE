2901067,0,t3_2sl2zl,I wonder what if your bf just considered getting a bachelors while in Korea? I know its more than likely meaningless to his field and he may never use it. However theres a good chance that as an international student most of his tuition would be covered and he may ever receive a living stipend. He would then be on a student visa. He could study do remote programming and then thered be no issues with visas.edit also waygook means foreignalien placeland. waygookin is foreigner.,teachinginkorea,cnxuv2k,2,t5_33pt1

If she wanted to work she could just get a different visa when she finds a job. Depending on how old your daughter is a lot of hagwons will let the children of teachers attend the school for free I know POLY does that.  It shouldnt be a big deal. ,teachinginkorea,cq1q093,1,t5_33pt1
3822754,0,t3_344cff, Ive known multiple people who have had horrible experiences with The Arrival Store in regards to phones. Its incredibly convenient but suitably expensive. Another problem is that they are resellers obviously another store is providing them with the phonesSim cards. This becomes an issue when you need support. You have to use The Arrival Store to help you but they refuse to connect you directly to the store who sold the phone. So you end up waiting ridiculous amounts of time as they try to figure things out. tldr expensive poor supportNo idea on the plane tickets.,teachinginkorea,cqs0ya0,2,t5_33pt1

People have been saying for the last three years that EPIK is becoming smaller and smaller but theres still a market for it.

Also notice that you are required to work overtime if another teacher is sick or absent.You should have national health insurance and government pension contribution  employer amp  employee.What is two weeks vacation? Is that  business days or  business days? Do you work on National Holidays?You should at least have  paid sick day in a contract.Be wary of housing deposits as high as  won.

5422961,0,t3_3papit,Good post.  This reflects everything that other English teachers have told me about Korea.  But I think these same problems can be applied to most asian countries.  I got a CELTA cert a couple months ago and thought all that hard work was finally going to pay off.  Then I start applying for jobs in Hong Kong and no one has any idea what the CELTA is.  I even had to get a letter to go along with the CELTA stating that the course was done in a classroom and that the cert was a hrs course .  Very maddening when I could have gone online for any English cert and applied to these same jobs.  Also all that teaching theory learned in the CELTA has to be thrown out the window when your classroom needs to be taught according to the teaching standards parents that expect.  Trying to explain to a parent or even a school owner a lesson plan is pointless when in the end they can dictate how your class should be taught even though they dont speak English or have any teaching experience.  ,teachinginkorea,cw4u8un,5,t5_33pt1

5802358,0,t3_3ulelq,  I just had a quick look at the csat it seems... not really very good.  Some of it was ok but yeah...  multiple choice questions should not be used at this level at all.  Please look at the equivalent UK English Literature exam examples and UK English Language exam examples and compare the type of questions and answers wanted from the student.  You can see they are fundamentally different.I can not really see any benefits in the CSAT exam system.  I use them obviously not usually in normal conversation but when writing something or maybe when I am explaining something.  They are just words to be used when appropriate.  If you are describing some thing abstract then use the word abstract Im not sure I understand your question.  Again same as above I use when needed like when writing a reddit comment or an email I barely use any punctuation but when I am writing an essay or official letter or whatever then correct writing punctuation is mandatory.  Are you trying to prove grammar is not needed?  Because it is but having exams on it is just insane.  Konglish nonsense shows a total lack of attempt to communicate or shows any empathy I would probably go further and say it is rude especially if you know their English level is high.  You are just saying I cant be bothered to even make a small effort in talking to you even though you expressed interest in my well being because Im self obsessed or belligerent.,teachinginkorea,cxgc5vb,1,t5_33pt1

6607020,0,t1_d01spcv,Its not a bad area per sae but I think itd be a really stressful area to work. The parents there are super controlling of their childrens education and complain if they feel their children are getting what they want. When I came to Korea to teach with GEPIK I interviewed with a school in Ilsan a new highly affluent city and in Bucheon a regular middleclass city.  When I interviewed with the Ilsan school the lady was like Ok youre going to be required to do this and this and this... and then she asked me to come up with a complete lesson plan for a certain topic on the spot. The interview with the school in Bucheon however was completely different. The lady was like oh! Were just so happy to have a native English teacher!I chose the Bucheon school and they really appreciated me there and had a great couple years there. Ive known a lot of people that have been fired from hagwons because the kids complained to their parents who in turn complained to the hagwon director that the teacher was boring. Believe me In Korea you can be fired for being boring or having too soft a voice as a teacher.,teachinginkorea,d02pzcf,1,t5_33pt1

As for recruiters they are all connected to certain branches and areas.
