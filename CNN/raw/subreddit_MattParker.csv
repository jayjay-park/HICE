Number L will be low number B will be the number of the second guy and number H will be high.So you can have LBH BLH or LHB. If B is the highest the first guy says L. If B is the lowest the first guy says H.If B is in the middle you say B.So if we have  of the chances that B is gonna be either Lowest Highest of in the middle and then  of those  times you get a  of living by choosing L or H you have that the first guy can live  of the times.PS notice that if the first guy chooses L or H has a  chance of living. I made it so  of the times he gets that  but  of the times he will de anyway so that he can save the rest .Its easy to save  the problem is to get the closest to  for the first guy.Regards.,MattParker,d0vrmu3,2,t5_3ch47

But Either way the rd always knows which number is the one missing so he knows he own number.If you say that you cannot repeat then the second guy would die  of the times thats the only change.You can still save   of times.,MattParker,d0wad8h,1,t5_3ch47
