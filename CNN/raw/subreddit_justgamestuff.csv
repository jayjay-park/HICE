You can even set it up for a DnD campaign and download the different games from the Steam workshop. It can be a little tedious to set up at first but after its pretty easy to do. Also if you are bored while other people are playing you can flicklaunch stuff all over the place XD,justgamestuff,cyd1w7j,1,t5_3bgjt
