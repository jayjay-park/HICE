11079529,0,t3_5y603k,The problem is witch hunting. Its never  certain whether the person intentially logged or not.Of course if its combat situation someone is getting their ass kicked and suddenly they dissapear its  a combat log but you can never be certain.Rinlzer himself combat logged in one fight but managed to get back in quickly and explain to the people he was fighting that his internet dropped so all was cool.Imagine if he hadnt got back in due to a total internet blackout in his area for several hours. Elitecombatloggers would have had a new submission which Rinzler IIRC runs and the community would have all been bad mouthing Rinzler for being a dirty combat logger. The extreme PvEers would have had a field day over a technical glitch.This is why combat logging videos should always be treated with an ounce of possibility that it wasnt intentional.... unless its someone who has done it more than once.At the end of the day if someones internet is so dodgy that it happens frequently accidentally during combat then they probably shouldnt be playing in open.,Elite_Dangerous,denurxb,4,t5_35fwv

11099313,0,t1_deq263z,Yeah now I have the old girl all a rated and junk. I did a little looking at your build so I tried to improve some things with it. Boa snake by swapping burst for pulse we get lots of power back at a cost of a little dps which we can then put into boosters and if you upgrade the scoop class to a  since you werent using those slots it scoops faster and is cheaper.  And finally by setting up power prioritys we can squeeze every last drop of power out of that power plant also by setting up power prioritys you wont lose control when you ships powerplant gets shot out cause that reduces your power output to  hence the vital modules being power priority  below  usage.Also on live youll have more sheilds than In Coriolis because Coriolis is using the nerfed booster stats.Edit put the kws in power group .,Elite_Dangerous,deq3ity,1,t5_35fwv

11122294,0,t3_5ys6zt,gt I read somewhere that a A prismatic is equal to a a standard shield. So once upgraded my A prismatic will be better than something like an d shield?Its not that simple. Each shield has an optimal hull mass which scales your shield strength based on your ships hull mass NOT total ship mass. In addition each ship has its own multiplier built in. Just think of it as an extra A rating. Long story short depending on how your ships hull mass compares to your shield generators minoptimalmax mass a Prismatic Shield will be between  and  stronger than a standard A shield however you should always get the same number of extra MJs compared to a standard A shield  of your ships base shield before the shield generator multiplier. This does mean that ships that are on the heavy side of the shields optimal mass benefit proportionally more from upgrading to a prismatic shield.,Elite_Dangerous,despbfq,5,t5_35fwv

11735188,0,t3_67fyo2,Engineering really helps too. if you dont have time and resources for all of that just try to be tactical with your builds. NPC Shields are strong against explosive weapons and weak against thermals when Shields go down the resistance are basically opposite. Plasma accelerators are hard to use but they eat through Shields pretty fast. I would start with some gumball multicannons and  or  plasmas practice manually aiming your gumball guns until you are confident enough to upgrade to fixed... Side note fixed multis are harder to use then fixed plasma because you have to keep on target to sustain damage but with plasma you just have to sweep the target and shoot.
