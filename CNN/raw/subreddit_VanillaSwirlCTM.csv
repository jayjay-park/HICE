7062861,0,t3_4btdb9,Hi Brian  Just saying that if you ever need to translate this map into Chinese or promote it in Chinese community you can talk to me about it. While I am not perfect at English yet I think I can do a somewhat decent job on translating. It would take some time. And I also know that theres a huge appeal of Minecraft in Chinese community though people might not know this map exist since reddit is probably blocked there. Pretty sure a lot of people would be interested in this kind of map especially if it is translatable. So if you ever need some promotion in Chinese website and stuff I would be more than willing to help ,VanillaSwirlCTM,d1gxpwb,1,t5_3cv32
7807957,0,t3_4gvelu,Update to say that I finished the map may  bI liked it all except for the last dungeon. The last dungeon was boring. The number of mobs and especially witches eventually forces you to tunnel into the wall. I made a bit of progress tunneling under the redstone trail. When I got to the cave before the ravine my game was lagging from all  entities that were spawned. Couldnt break any spawners because zombies walked in front of them and trying to go literally anyfuckingwhere means you would be met with a zombie conga line. Wahoo.If you broke a block in the wrong spot it would fill with  zombies within seconds and youd have to waste time making a throwaway stone sword to clear them all out if you got hit by a witch youd have to waste time waiting for the poison to wear off if a creeper blew up youd have to waste time backtracking  blocks and killing the silverfish. You cant leave a x hole to attack from because out of the  not kidding I checked F zombies at least  were babies which everyone knows are fucking broken in ..I switched to peaceful grabbed the sponge and walked home. Looking at the amount of spawners on the walls of the ravine I dont think I missed out on much.Really fantastic map other than that besides the purple beacon I think its my favorite minecraft map. And I love your commentary series and if I decide to make a minecraft map ill be taking notes ,VanillaSwirlCTM,d3toe6g,2,t5_3cv32
