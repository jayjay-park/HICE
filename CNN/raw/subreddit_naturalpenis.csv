3787804,0,t1_cqo0rt1,Holy crap you wrote back fast! I was just about to turn off my computer. But I see what you mean about the piercing.I just finished reading norms website. Restoring is not what fixed the issue number . I have a feeling it was more psychological or quality of erection is lower which occurs as we age. Have you spoke with them about it? What makes you think they were trying to define you?Correlation does not imply causation my friend. Also your Erectile Dysfunction sources are outdated more recent studies have shown otherwise. But thats a topic for another if I still remain interested in the issue. But I can understand how you would feel that way. In your case you were one of the cases that people say never happen. I am shocked your physicians never mentioned anything to you or your parents especially during physicals.I will check out the other communities sometime...probably...maybe...It depends. I really hope they do not hit me with wikipedia logic   or sources from biased blogs.I will admit if you were one of the people attempting to speak to me during my awkward encounter you would have had a better chance convincing me to support your side of the table than they did. Im still not convinced that the procedure should be outlawed and is mutilation but I did enjoy our chat. Im going to sleep now I will check this thread in the morning.Important note Im not sure how you did the cool guy quotes but I will Google how to do that soon. ,naturalpenis,cqo1g0k,1,t5_2sw7y
