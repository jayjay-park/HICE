7746023,0,t1_d2xbfjk,Eh. He threatened to ban me because I said I was a happy hapa and he went through my post history and saw that my father was a sociopathnarcissist something Id already mentioned to him before. I told him that some people can get past their own issues and be happy but he said I was in denialhiding skeletonspossibly in the closet.I just decided it wasnt worth arguing and stopped going.
