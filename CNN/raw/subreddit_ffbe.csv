9678859,0,t3_5dn9a4,I think high HP  def and spr are needed to get through some of the turns. Provoke can help with the single target attacks too.,ffbe,da64fz1,1,t5_3f815
9845372,0,t1_daquybr,Ahhh. I was wondering. So if a character gets their TM you can assign it to anyone? Didnt know that. Thanks.,ffbe,daqviaj,3,t5_3f815

9990729,0,t1_db9swcx,I dont know why the nox recorder records off the microphone ignore the couple seconds of talking This is an Elza unit with dual wield!  Loads of fun!The first round I run the dual wield version and then the standard madness rush to see the difference.And after that I just basically clear the elt version of the event by using my Elza to debuff the defenses of the bosses.  Very OP thats the TM I want!,ffbe,db9tiii,1,t5_3f815
10054086,0,t3_5ihuqb,Dont forget that you can set a helper team so that your leader wont change while playing or grinding. Its a must during events you put up bonus giving leader and play with whatever you want. On another note i used Garnet as leader for over  months until i got Kefka and now i have Luneth as leader.A quick question btw anyone know if doublehand stacks with chizurus blade mastery?,ffbe,dbi2lt7,1,t5_3f815

10197148,0,t3_5m0d45,I think I fought you in the arena. Good times. Only Mercedes I have seen.Really. If someone was injecting I dont think Mercedes would be their unit of choice no matter how beastly she can be.,ffbe,dbzwiuv,1,t5_3f815

10404499,0,t1_dcnevv6,I see I should have added a caveat of from the perspective of a new player since people have no ability to perceive the vastness of the playerbase that isnt whales or rolling in s. ,ffbe,dcnf0xv,1,t5_3f815
10516694,0,t1_dczzmov,Oh rippppp. I see. Interesting thanks for the heads up! I thought maybe it was just magicmagic not Black Magic. Thanks for the clarification. ,ffbe,dd06i1z,1,t5_3f815
10546275,0,t3_5r017h,For FP units finish levelling them and sell them for  gil.For other units keep a handful of them to help you farm things like megacite and sell the rest,ffbe,dd3jdrb,1,t5_3f815
10585621,0,t1_dd7iq6x,I fucking hate Noctis.I want him.,ffbe,dd7tq6k,3,t5_3f815
10631921,0,t1_ddcli6c,Dual wield is obtained from Zidane? Is that the only way to get it on Noctis?,ffbe,ddcloet,2,t5_3f815
10649839,0,t1_ddcnutd,Both are good. We still have mog king event running. You can get as many  star awakening mats.  But in order of priority to awaken of course Noctis should go first hes a  star base with good all around stats with higher chance of survival in any content. Exdeath is good for elemental chaining. Although he doesnt have high hp so youll need a good supporthealing team to keep him alive. ,ffbe,ddeg5zx,1,t5_3f815
