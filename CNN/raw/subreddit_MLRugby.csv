11382271,0,t1_dfm4nwj,I guess they made the deal with the TWC local channel for you old fogies to watch on your old fashioned cable TVs....lolI did just watch the hype video for FloSports. I have to say its pretty legit. From first impressions it looks like the video quality will increase to a more professional level which definitely gives the team more of a professional atmosphere. I wish they had soccer on FloSports tho something like the USL. For some reason I feel like getting minor league soccer fans to watch the MLR would be easier than getting fans from other sports. ,MLRugby,dfm5t8h,2,t5_3j3bl
11424440,0,t1_dfqxzef,CEO was at the match yesterday his mom is going thru chemo and he is at the end of surgery rehab. We talked for  minutes or so. He did not state dollar amounts but he did say that the contracts he and Frenchy discussed were enough to make him consider coming home to play. Nothing is in stone yet. But the Huns have been talking to CEO since I made intros between the two...,MLRugby,dfqy61u,4,t5_3j3bl

11739586,0,t1_dgqowwz,Based on how I read it he has to hold a season every year and failing to hold a complete season in  is automatic termination which is year three.  I would say that failing to hold a second season would cause automatic termination.  But if you read the Congress Notes Chairman Will Chang is pretty clear that its in litigation.  By Dan Paynes comments PRO is still within their rights to hold a second season and USAR still wants to see it happen.  So again screw Doug.,MLRugby,dgqpn58,3,t5_3j3bl
