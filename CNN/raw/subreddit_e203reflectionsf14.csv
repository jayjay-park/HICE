2321158,0,t3_2lq3t5,I chose to discuss a journal article titledGender Discrimination at Work Connecting Gender Stereotypes Institutional Policies and Gender Composition of Workplace written by Donna BobbittZeher. I found this article interesting because it discusses an important issue in many societies that involves every individual. It also grabbed my attention since I am interested in knowing the main reasons behind gender discrimination in workplace. This article tries to understand how gender stereotyping and organizational factors may contribute to gender discrimination in workplace by analyzing  discrimination narratives constructed from sex discrimination cases brought before the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. I find this article scholar because it expands our knowledge by providing  us with reasons behind a serious issue in our society.,e203reflectionsf14,clylxth,1,t5_33bmn
