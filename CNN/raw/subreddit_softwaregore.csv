57877,0,t1_cekss4f,To expand on that Given the restricted character policy there are a bit less than  possible passwords .  is all possible valid characters on an American keyboard that would comply with the password policy.  because of the  requirement for the first letter and the double letter rule for everything elseStill at  billion passwords a second Probably somewhat optimistic but some computers can probably do it thatd take a bit less than  hours to exhaust the minimum password requirements. Not that much time.This isnt necessarily relevant but I stumbled across it the other day and find it extraordinarily interesting. Heres a quote from Bruce Schneier about how we could utilize all of the energy of the sun and still not get close to brute forcing the whole key space of AESgtOne of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. Stick with me the physics lesson is almost over.gtgtGiven that k  . ergKelvin and that the ambient temperature of the universe is .Kelvin an ideal computer running at .K would consume . ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.gtgtNow the annual energy output of our sun is about . ergs. This is enough to power about . single bit changes on our ideal computer enough state changes to put a bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for  years without any loss we could power a computer to count up to . Of course it wouldnt have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.gtgtBut thats just one star and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like  ergs. About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos but let them go for now. If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation a bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.gtgtThese numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that bruteforce attacks against bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space. ,softwaregore,cel0q2u,39,t5_2w2ea

2323049,0,t1_clyqgff,Since you seem knowledgeable about this perhaps you can explain something that happened once.I wanted to take a screenshot of something in a movie.  I played it in VLC afaik and paused it where I wanted my screenshot I took the screenshot in a window. When I minimized VLC and pasted my screenshot to paint I just got a black box as the video.  Somewhat discouraged I tried a different approach this time I kept the video next to paint and it worked! I got my screenshot and it looked as I wanted it to however as soon as I saved it afaik it returned to be a black box for the video.  Trying a third time I now wanted to test something I took my screenshot as before but then I resumed the video playing lo and behold it also played in the screenshot in paint I think might have been only updating when paused?. Any way I wanted to document this but I didnt want to bother with taking pictures of my monitor so I have no proof.Is that caused by something similar? I can see how you might get a black box but how it can work while the video is open and then go missing I am clueless about.,softwaregore,clyuccr,6,t5_2w2ea

4158985,0,t3_37zklm,Yes.Why is the installer inside the Program Files directory? That directory is managed by the OS and should not be edited by a user.Im assuming you created the Scrolls directory in Program Files and put the installer there. Unfortunately Scrolls MSI installer is userlocal and installs to LOCALAPPDATAMojangScrolls  so it never requests elevated permissions to install to system folders. This means the installer cannot modify Program Files and therefor cannot find itself.Run it from someplace like your Desktop or Downloads folder and you should be fine.

During that time we never really cared about the security of the forum since we were planning to do the rest of the websiterelated stuff when the project was nearing completion.A few months after the project got scrapped my cousin decided to check the website again to see if it was still online it was a free server. He then immediately messaged me on skype telling that I should take a look at the websiteThere were literally thousands of spambots registered on the forum and together they had already posted millions of spam posts. Every time you refreshed the page at least one of them had written a new post by then.We didnt use the site nor the server anymore so we didnt mind it but we were still amazed at how badly a website can get messed up if you dont put any effort in security.,softwaregore,czcrmk7,1,t5_2w2ea

All raw hash functions are way too fast to be good for password hashing by themselves. If you use something modern like say bcrypt with a good number of iterations  is fine. According to these benchmarks of a GTX  it gets  Mhs with sha but only  Hs with bcrypt. At that speed youre looking at  years to crack a  entropy password hashed with bcrypt.Even if you use this password on a poorlywritten website thats still using raw SHA thats still  days on a GTX .

The developer dun fucked up. Your carrier sucks and you should find a new one ASAP as a stab at myself for missing a response condition.  Well the first client to use the API was an airline carrier and sales decided to use my test app as a sample app.  Which their devs used as a starting point to develop their app...

Once this is received the app wakes up and fetches all new data messages statuses profile pictures etc and then creates a specific notification. Sometimes when the connection is bad or background data usage is forbidden the first part happens but the second part cannot happen until you open the app. In those cases you see this message. One silly side effect of this is that you receive notifications for messages in a group that youve actually muted. ,softwaregore,dgs39hx,14,t5_2w2ea
