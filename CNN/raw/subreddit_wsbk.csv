6688396,0,t1_d0b301c,Interesting. I knew Crescent switched but it sounds like perhaps Suzuki doesnt want to devote the resources to WSBK right now probably because of what theyre spending developing a MotoGP bike. I assume well see them back in a few years when theyve got a new bike.,wsbk,d0b5042,1,t5_2t23e
6889271,0,t1_d0wrdi4,A lot of people making mistakes in this one. Surprised Rea managed to catch Sykes with the mistakes he made. Quite ominous for the rest of the year I think.,wsbk,d0x7sjr,2,t5_2t23e

8265295,0,t3_4s8qi9,Ya not a fan of this at all.  I understand what theyre after but I think its ridiculous.  I would think people who watch WSBK and who are in the market for a superbike already know what brandsmodels theyre looking at.  ,wsbk,d5apwtq,1,t5_2t23e

10954549,0,t1_de8rc4i,I brought the video pass for the season I cant see on there where it has a no spoiler link to the videos like the motogp one does can you see one? Pleased the quality of filming has got better think that was why I lost interest a few years back. ,wsbk,de9vtsc,2,t5_2t23e
11133184,0,t1_deth0pr,At the front of what pack? The ancient old Honda last year was more competitive than the new machine... Im sure Ten Kate will make up for it somewhat throughout the season but theyre having a tough time of it. ,wsbk,detxphr,1,t5_2t23e
11162979,0,t3_5zcwjg,Absolutely Another race to watch. Why would anyone not love it. As much as I love watching the big boys a lot of the times the best racing is in the low classes. Look at Moto  this season It was insanity! I love Supersport since I ride a zxr  and will gladly watch these s too. ,wsbk,dexb8l9,3,t5_2t23e
