6130625,0,t3_3zi5ym,If you post an application in the Applications Thread before pm GMT on th January then you are safe to log in. As long as you log in at least once onto the server before Hardmode starts at roughly pm GMT on th January then your account is safe and you can log in and play at any point across the round. The applications were made as a way of keeping track of players as we bind your Reddit account name to your IGN that you choose.If you account receives strikes then you wont be allowed to play in the next round and upon getting  strikes you are banned from the subreddit permanently. Dont worry though you have to do something fairly serious to receive a strike and we havent had anyone get one yet as our community is pretty good. There is no real goal other than to try and complete the daily Quests given on the subreddit. Each Guild can complete the Quest and on doing so your Guild is rewarded with free Crates the ones you can fish up.Rounds have lasted  days in the past however now that we have worked on a proper schedule we may be switching to  day rounds from now on. Round  which goes live today will be us testing the new  day round schedule.If youd like me to explain any more feel free to ask but I am currently hungry and want some breakfast lmao.,elfVSdwarf,cymhl6a,1,t5_38a2n
