7156921,0,t3_4arcgq, Hanging outside reading listening to music geeking out on stuff being on the computer coding  I think would prefer something akin to Skywalkers lightsaber for melee I like the blue compared to in the original movies although I would prefer a bow with plenty of spells and magic to augment my abilities..
