It sounds much hotter and aggressive. Flowmasters sound really deep but kinda flat and one dimensional like the same note constantly just with the volume turned up or down.With Cherry Bombs on this particular engine you really get a much wider vocal range as the engine goes through the RPMs from an aggressive baritone at idle all the way to a racing scream at full throttle.Just a difference in tastes is all nothing wrong with a great set of Flowmasters.An example from near idle to half throttle just as kind of an idea,classiccars,d40b88e,0,t5_2t1di
