9848753,0,t1_daqpwmc,Are the furi episodes DVD source? Do the frames match up ie same frame  results in the same frame? If so I may have an idea to combine themedit nvm they dont overlap. ,RemasteringATLA,darbd1h,2,t5_3g70f
10030127,0,t3_5hr9w2,Yall are amazing. Fully downloaded and seeding as much as I can for the next month or so.    One thing for potential downloaders to know  iTunes .. doesnt play any of the files. . is fine I think but ..x or at least mine anyway looks like it cant adequately handle AC. It should be playable since its in the proper h.  mp format but does funny things when loaded into iTunes. This isnt the first time Ive run into this so no biggie  but I figured Id let other folks know in case they use iTunes as their primary media management solution. Ill need to reencode later no big. Works fine in mPlayerX and VLC though the file seems to mess around with my audio output switches to Internal Speakers whilst still outputting through optical to my Zs. Weird behaviour but I can live with it   Mad props to ubobie for the subs. I actually reused the subs from the DVDs so if anyone else wants those SRTs just holler.,RemasteringATLA,dbeybi5,4,t5_3g70f
