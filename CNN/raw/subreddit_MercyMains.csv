10506886,0,t1_dcz1nbv,Ive had a few people tell me to switch to Lucio during a match.  out of  times I will just to see if it will change the pace of the game. I dont really have many people ask me to switch heroes. As long as youre a good mercy you should be fine. ,MercyMains,dcz2f19,6,t5_3e8bz

11398025,0,t1_dfnxwj3,Im sitting at low Diamond right now due to queuing with a friend and going down a few hundred but Ive had teams where Ill make a call no one listens and then another person makes the same call. That person then gets mad when they die and says why did no one say something? I wouldnt say reacting to a flanker is protecting someone I see it as you take out the person who is trying to tear your team apart but flying around helps. Constantly changing your position is a great thing because it makes it harder for them to get you. Lets say youre defending the point on Numbani and your team has the high ground with a teammate on the other platform. When the flanker goes to kill you fly to that teammate and then fly back to your team. Or cancel your flight half way through or drop down then fly to that one teammate. The less predictable you are the longer youll stay alive. ,MercyMains,dfny9g8,-1,t5_3e8bz
11593368,0,t3_6588ev,In terms of rezzing tips Rez is arguably the most powerful ult in the game so dont waste it. Ideally you always want to try and Rez two or more people at a time occasionally one mostly if you really need to keep a tank in play. Otherwise you should really just practice with Mercy and find your own stride. Like uryanmcmuffin said just look up some general tricks and add a few to your own strategy.,MercyMains,dga47ef,2,t5_3e8bz
