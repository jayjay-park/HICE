9541783,0,t1_d9p70f2,Justification for Markakis trade Fuck Matt Cain he took my money. Because I am set for the future at Christian Arroyos positions and he commited  errors in  chances at B I was willing to move him to give me some kind of flexibility this year to make other moves. Joan Gregorio was added in because hes almost  and had a FIP of . with an ERA over .

9653963,0,t1_da2dxup,aight so heres the thing i know i lost thats fine i have a bigger margin for error than any other gm so i wanted to buy the biggest lottery ticket possible. worst case scenario i give up two all star years of puig and seven above average years of maeda. best case scenario puig continues to be a pumpkin maedas  was an aberration unlikely but i do not think that hes going to hold up that performance long term. oh and i have an mvp candidate for two cheap ass years. it could really come back to bite me. thats cool. but im taking a shot that cutch can be  of the hitter he was when he was an mvp and that he can be a defensive plus in left. ,BaseballOffseason2017,da31vfa,2,t5_33mk1

9790858,0,t3_5ffxtq,I still have some interest in acquiring a young major league regular. Just check in if you have somebody youre shopping.  Adam Eaton Im not gonna sell you on Eaton anymore Im just going to say that Ive been closing in on an Eaton trade for about a week. If you want to jump in youll have to be ready to give me a serious large offer. I expect Eaton to be traded soon it would take a lot of things falling apart for him not to be moved.  Jose Quintana Im less certain Quintana will be traded. Im absolutely taking offers but given he has four years left on his contract I dont think hell have much less value a year from now so Im happy to keep him if i need to. Hes probably the most valuable pitcher left on the market so if youre in need of pitching you have no excuse not to at least make an offer.  Todd Frazier If Flava Fraz is still on the team in April Ive failed as a GM. If you need an impact bat at B B or DH send me a message about Frazier. The asking price may drop to a point where Im accepting a deal I dont love just because I feel like he needs to be traded this offseason. He is a very good hitter.  David Robertson Its not a foregone conclusion that Robertson is traded but Id be surprised if hes not. Chapman Jansen and Melancon are gone and all got paid more money than youre comfortable with paying. Robertson is on a  year deal and is a good closer or setup man. Im willing to eat some money if you want to give up prospects but dont have budget room. Message me about David Robertson.  Nate Jones Unlikely to be traded but potentially available.  Brett Lawrie If you trade for Lawrie he will be the bargain pickup of the offseason. Costs very little. I just have young infielders who need playing time.  Avisail Garcia Was a serviceable bench outfielder in . Costs nothing just message me that you want him and hes yours.  JB Shuck Bad. If you want him just take him. ,BaseballOffseason2017,dajxpuf,1,t5_33mk1
