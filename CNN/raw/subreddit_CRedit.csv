370377,0,t1_cfj42zf,Thanks for the info! The credit agency is called Grant amp Weber. Im currently a student and could potentially take out a federal student loans to cover the amount.     In your experience is this a good move? Unfortunately for me this is compounded on a mountain of student loan debt K I know it just keeps getting better. It seems like since my ultimate goal should be to get out of debt I should just walk away from this and any sort of rotating credit should at least be utilized to pay off debts at higher interest rates than those at which I can currently borrow.     I feel like at this point loans which are fixed by the fed at a manageable rate need to be used wisely. Due to my horrid credit score Im not going to be able to refinance any of my debts in any way thatll be a help to me after graduation.  Thanks again.,CRedit,cfj5l8g,1,t5_2qph1
784690,0,t3_234jyp,Just pay off the card and try to develop more responsible spending habits. No secret tricks here. Youre still young. Your credit score will restore itself naturally when you start making payments on time and get your balances low.Now is really the time to put your best foot forward with student loans looming around the corner. Its going to be nearly impossible to get approved for anything with a sub  score  in debt with a nearly maxed out credit card.Pay off your CC balance every month and look into getting a report on your credit. You can do this. The key is awareness.,CRedit,cgth1ch,3,t5_2qph1

1833523,0,t1_ck9iitj,Just thought Id let you know that I looked more into this and apparently its mostly people with subprime or near prime discover cards that benefit from this trick because they arent eligible or so they believe anyway for auto CLIs after  months etc. You can tell if you have a prime or near prime discover card by the amount of minimum interest that discover says they will charge in their terms and conditions. If its . then youre prime if its anything above that . . . etc then youre near prime and may benefit from this trick. I dont know how accurate that is but that seems to be the consensus on the FICO forums. Prime members seem to think they get auto CLIs from a heavy usage andor b when another one of their cards raises your CL and discover tries to match or beat it. Hope that helps. Of course its mostly speculation and nothing is set in stone. ,CRedit,cka4u3p,1,t5_2qph1

2184615,0,t3_2k360k,Credit cards are a tricky thing. I myself have  credit cards.  AMEX  CHASE  CITI. Since no one card gives you all the benefits you need the way I use my cards is that I spend on different things on different cards. i.e. I play to the benefits of each card. Amex  costco so I can spend on credit as opposed to debitChase preferred  so I can get entertainment and dining rewards Chase Freedom  amazon gas Citi  I barely use that shit cause its worthless going to close it soonTo answer your question about opening more credit cards?Well theres upsides and downsides UP you get more credit and so theres more flexibilityDOWNyou have one more statement to worry about I hate all the times per month I get statements you could be irresponsible about spending since you have it use it unless youre prudent and strong willedMy advice if you dont need it dont get it.One more stupid questionis it easy to pay off a credit card thats not tied to your checkingsavings bank? Yes. I do it all the time. Certain banks dont let you pay off using external accounts on the mobile apps though. TLDR  dont do it unless theres a benefit of a reward from your credit card else its an extra headache.

3088590,0,t1_cohczxg,based on what you are saying accounts that are never delinquent should never be on your credit report because there is no delinquency date.Just because the debt is old doesnt mean it isnt valid.According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA the legislation that governs credit file information the date a negative account drops off your credit report is seven years from the date of your last activity on the account.

3279617,0,t3_2xl8uk,I would highly suggest looking at the Chase Slate if that options available to you. Its  APR for  months with a  balance transfer fee. I wouldnt put much worry on  new hard inquiry for the chase card since you plan of going through your credit union for the car loan. Your credit union is much friendlier than a bank and the credit score for car loans is a bit different than that of one for credit loans. Your application is also reviewed by a board of members who likely volunteer their time and take more into account than just your credit report although it does still play a large role. A bank is the complete opposite. If you have a well maintained relationship with them it helps all the more. Remember you are a member of the credit union. They are not for profit owned by the members only and you were accepted because you meet their criteria to join. Youre not just a customer like with a national bank who is owned by shareholders and make decisions based purely on profit. ,CRedit,cp23pn8,2,t5_2qph1

Perhaps Walt Disney J.C. Penney and a few other icons of capitalism were total idiots in using their policies to not only start or keep afloat their empires but the very large number of Fortune  companies and C  suites who are partly compensated via permanent life products. Source The Pirates of Manhattan by Barry James Dyke page . There is a reason why permanent life insurance is considered a TIER  asset by all major financial institutions including the Fed. More secure than real estate and precious metals. Look up BOLI and COLI! Some of these behemoth financial houses SELL tons of term life but BUY tons of permanent life. Their action speak loudly. In our fiat currency system that speaks volumes.

4535318,0,t3_3d5vqo,Heres what will happen Opening a card requires a lender to pull your credit report which results in a hard inquiry. Your score will take a small hit for every hard inquiry but only on the Bureaus that the card company pulls.  Opening a card will add an account to your credit profile on all  bureaus reports once the statement closes. This may increase you number of accounts which is good but it will also lower your average age of accounts. If you currently have four cards and lets just say each one is    and  years old respectively your AAoA is currently  yrs old. Opening a new account will decrease it to . years. It will take time to build it back up.  Opening a card will add to your overall credit. This can lower your overall utilization if you carry a balance on any of your cards or let any of them report a balance from month to month. If you dont the increase in available credit wont really help your score since your utilization is already low. Its a general consensus that a below  is good but keeping it below  and as low as  is best and can actually improve your score. Having it report at  is generally not good as anyone who pulls your report will only see that you dont use your cards at all and may affect their decision to give you a new card if you dont use your current ones. An increase in overall credit may be able to help you get approved for higher limits on new cards in the future with card companies youre currently with since the bank pulling your report will see you manage your current limits well.  Youre scores percentage relating to on time payments will not be affected as long as you continue not to have any late payments. Overall from the info youve provided opening a new card will not significantly improve your score since you dont carry a balance have a few accounts already and dont have late payments. In fact with those marks it will only hurt your score. But this is only a small amount and temporary. It will bounce back and increase over a couple months as the inquiry affects it less after  months then  months then drops off in  months and over the following years as your AAoA grows again and is stronger overall. All that said I would encourage you to open a new card for this purchase but not to help your score. If you have the cash to pay it off thats perfect. Find a credit card that has a great sign up bonus or great cash back percentage put the purchase on that card pay it off and gain the benefits of your bonus or cash back. Its even better if you can find a card that will benefit you by using everyday for all your purchases this is the best way to use a credit card after allA few examples of what you could do. Only you know your situation spending habits and can decide what card will be most useful to you in the long run.. You could get a cash back card like the Citi Double Cash. It gives you unlimited  cash back on all your purchases after you pay the balance in full. Thats  back for your  ring purchase. It has  APR for  months and no annual fee.. You could get a card that gives you Airline Miles. Do you travel home to see your family? You could get a Citi American Airlines Card. You can earn  bonus miles after k of purchases in the first  months and  mile for every dollar spent on normal purchases. Thats  AA Miles for your ring purchase.  miles can get you a round trip ticket in economy to anywhere in the US.  Miles can get you a one way economy ticket to Japan Korea or anywhere in Europe. Thats worth a little more than  Cash Back if you want to go somewhere for vacation or travel back home often. Ohh.. youll also get your first checked bag and up to  traveling companions free each flight as well as priority boarding and  off in flight purchases like internet food headphones etc.. This one has an annual fee which i dont typically recommend for people new to this but its waived the first and cancelling it after a year if you dont use its benefits enough isnt going to hurt your credit. I put this in as an example of the benefits you can get from simply opening a new card for a large purchase you were going to pay for with cash for anyways. You could also get a card with Hotel Points. Coincidentally mainly because they have good bonuses right now another Citi card you could get is the Citi Hilton HHonors Visa. Youll get  Hilton HHonors points after k of purchases and  points for all your every day spending. Thats  points after your ring purchase. Thats enough points for  nights of free hotel stays in a category  Hilton or partner hotel. It also gives you automatic Silver Status and has no Annual Fee.What makes the most sense for you? Check American Express Chase Citi Barclaycard BoA Wells Fargo and all the other banks to see what intrigues you most. Avoid the cards with annual fees that way everything you earn on it is free. And put all your everyday purchases on them BUT DONT SPEND THE MONEY SITTING IN YOUR CHECKING ACCOUNT AND PAY THEM OFF EVERY MONTH! If youre responsible and use them as if the money is coming out of your checking account they can be a great tool. Youll earn points miles or cash back and credit cards come with a slew of benefits that debit cards an cash dont. Purchase protection free monthly credit score extended warranty or insurance coverage and partner specific benefits just to name a few.just do me one favor above all else. Dont get financing or a credit card through the ring merchant. You dont need a card from them with  months  financing and that can only be used in their store. There are TONS of other cards out there that you can use anywhere in the world gain pointsmilescashback from and even give you months or more  APR financing.,CRedit,ct2b4xa,3,t5_2qph1

If the dispute is unsuccessful Id contact both accounts in writing and request a Debt Validation. Theyll need to prove you owe it. If they do provide information then perhaps the payment was made to the OC and not transmitted to the CA? You should work hard on getting these two off as it will provide a nice boost to your score that you really need at this point.gt Closed Collections ... Should I just wait the  years to falloff?I would. In fact if these are taking  years to drop they might not be negative as that is  years. Insurance paid the debt I dont think its a negative for you. Regardless should be gone soon enough.gt is this worth paying Ive read it wouldnt be worth payingA couple answers here    If you owe a debt it makes sense to pay it. But at this point the company has taken its asset back the vehicle and the debt is a write off so the morality of the situation is something for you to work out on your own.  Next answer  Id find out when the account is due to drop from your report. Its actually  years for collection accounts with negative information. That is usually  years from the Date of First Delinquency.  Regardless a call to the credit bureau NOT the Collections Agency! will get you the answer of when it is due to drop.

Thats me but not where  in medical bills is easy to just pay off yet.  When you say lt less than  you mean for the month? Does this mean the balance that I carry over?ExampleBob has a  credit line. Bob buys a  television but pays off  the same month the credit card statement is due. He now owes  on the credit card and has less than a  credit utilization for this card.

Coming up i will rent a car on the card in September. This will push this to OVER  of course but I will still plan on paying it off after the charges appear on the card or after the statement gets mailed to me to be certain it appears right?.so then does this damage me? the other question was whether or not I should keep a  balance or less which sounds like a stupid question but maybe not. Is it better to never pay off the card ? I was told once a long time ago that a card that is paid off suddenly shows no responsibility just a possible windfall of money on the consumers behalf..

I dont like the card very much  but Im willing to out up with it in trade for helping my score,CRedit,d8l9vi1,1,t5_2qph1
9272914,0,t3_56tjit,This happened to me this month. I dispute an transaction on my discovercard and they sent me a new card. I didnt do anything and my credit score lowered  points overnight. My guess is the old account is report as closed and the new card bring down my average age of credit history,CRedit,d8reprm,3,t5_2qph1

And I think that credit card companies would take serious issue with this use of the line of credit.Youre a guest. If you act like a guest youll walk out owing nothing more than the charges you expected. If you break or steal stuff youre going to get nailed for it.I dont see an ethical legal or moral or credit problem anywhere in sight.,CRedit,d8sgiez,5,t5_2qph1

9928107,0,t1_db1mrp1,The wise thing to do is to get a card you dont mind keeping forever even if you dont actively use it much. This improves your average age of accounts rating. You want a card to PASSIVELY help build your credit. All it takes is  a month  got Netflix? Spotify? Link your new credit card to your checking account and set up autopay. Boom... instant credit booster. You would literally never have to touch that card again and it is continually working in your favor.Closing accounts do more harm than good so consider that. Banks value histories with their customers.Give Discover IT secured card a try. No annual fee or foreign transaction fees has decent rewards for a card to rebuild credit.  cash back on groceries and gas unlimited  cash back on everything else first year of cash back is fully matched by Discover. Free monthly FICO score and the possibility of review to upgrade into unsecured card after  months of activation.They are very lenient even with minimalno credit history and that says something. ALSO have you tried applying for secured CC with any local credit unions lately? They are usually pretty willing to work with people looking to rebuild.,CRedit,db1nojq,6,t5_2qph1
10012822,0,t3_5j18vk,Creditors have to actively report debt to the credit bureaus.  For some reason that debt wasnt actively reported.  This could be for a number of reasons bad bookkeeping the debt was sold off to a different company that hasnt reported yet etc.  Up until the  years pass it could reappear again.  Also starting in January September  paid medical debt will automatically be removed from your credit report.  In the past Medical debt stayed on your report for the  years therefore paying it off did nothing for your report.  This only applies for Medical Debt all other debt still remains if paid unless you negotiate a pay for delete.  Edit  became confused when the new rules for medical debt would be in effect.  ,CRedit,dbcp72e,1,t5_2qph1
10186927,0,t3_5kxvqj,I did the same thing when I got my first place. I dont know your situation and Im not going to assume but back in those days the line between needs and wants were blurred. Its nice to have nice things but the one piece of advice I wish someone had instilled in me is that if I cant afford to pay for a place to rest my butt in full I probably cant afford it all. Like the other guy said its worth spending a few hours checking out local thrift shops and craigslist. Those few hours could save you thousands of dollars.,CRedit,dbyqt6g,1,t5_2qph1
10219798,0,t3_5kx77y,Check out selflender.com. It is basically a savings account that you pay into each month and they will report the account as a loan on your credit bureaus. I saw a  point jump in my credit score once I started using them. The fees are negligible and best of all youre actually saving towards your future rather than racking up debt.,CRedit,dc2gznv,1,t5_2qph1

10381611,0,t3_5omcnz,You are already on a very good track  your scores are not too low to have not paid any attention to your credit in years just use your cards  pay them BEFORE the statement closes and only let one card report less than   percent utilization every mth  you will maximize your scores this way. Also dont app for anything else for a while just grow what you have been approved for for  mths to a year and you will be over  in no time. Also on the collections accts did you offer a Pay for delete?  If not you really need to try to get them to delete these from your files otherwise they will be there there for  years . And paid or not paid its still gonna show as a derogatory mark .,CRedit,dcktiww,2,t5_2qph1

10854712,0,t3_5v6gid,Okay a couple things A credit card might help your credit but probably not if youre putting all purchases on it then paying it off in full. Unless you get a huge credit limit your all expenses will probably be a high percentage of the credit limit. You want your utilization to be below . For example if your card has a  limit you want to charge less than  to that card at the time your statement cuts.  Besides that based on your explanation I would say that you are most certainly not in a responsible position to purchase a home at the moment  let alone a SECOND home. Why are you buying a second home if you can only put k down? What is your reason for buying a second home in the first place? What kind of emergency fund does your family have in place? Is your first home paid off? The whole premise of this post feels like a financial disaster waiting to happen. ,CRedit,ddzl4qi,2,t5_2qph1
