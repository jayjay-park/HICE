425932,0,t1_cfowk9t,I can see where you are coming from. Regarding seeing banners everywhere stating We Accept Mintcoins you have to remember this coin has only been out for twenty days. Sure in the crypto world that could meen years but it is still a very very new coin.As more and more people find out about Mintcoins then it will be accepted. It takes a lot of time to get programmers on board to write the proper codes for POS systems and such for a retailer to decide if they are going to accept a coin.I think as time goes on and more things are developed for this coin you will see a far greater interest as well as value.The way the wallet is designed is that the coins have to reside in the Stake section of the wallet for twenty days to earn the interest. So you have ten thousand coins in the Stake section knowing you will be payed X amount of coins in twenty days.The coins in your regular balance are free to be spent you could spend X amount knowing youre not really losing anything what youre buying is actually free. This will most likely mean a lot more spending than one would expect.The interest aspect of the coin is a very big selling feature to retailers because we all know their banks are not going to be giving them that kind of interest.,MintCoin,cfowvnu,1,t5_304uj

639743,0,t1_cgcze0l,. of all Mintcoins are held in only  wallets.The rest of what you say has no relevance on the  million Mint the devs premined and is no proof that they premined more.The fact is the premine was  million and has been stated as such from the very beginning. Myself I see no problem with a coin having a premine it is no different than a company having an IPO before going public they never release all the shares to the exchanges for sale.Look at Facebook they pre sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the company long before they went public they do this for the same reason coin developers do so they have some sort of funds to promote and maintain the coins. The quicker the crypto currency communities get away from this premine issue the better for all cryptos overall.,MintCoin,cgczmol,2,t5_304uj

693563,0,t3_221pvo,I have been looking for a proper changelog every time I update. A github commit doesnt really tell me much.It would also be nice if the official site actually listed the version number and not just the date because I usually dont remember when I updated last.And what do you mean by has removed PoW? I thought it was supposed to be a combined PoSPoW coin. Did the devs decide to change the one of the fundamental aspects of the coin without mentioning it anywhere? That seems like the kind of thing they should advertise in every possible Mintcoin community before even considering it. Did I just miss it? Or does the title just refer to some behind the scenes cleanup that wont change how the coin functions?EDIT It look like that might not actually be the case but I have been hearing a lot of people going on about how its more secure because it uses both PoW and PoS.It would be nice if there was another way to download the binaries.

The issue seems to be that the developer claimed the reason for the existence of such a generous premine was for coin development and infrastructure  okay you made the claim back it up and show the community where the coins have gone. not where they might be going based on hypothetical outcomes  where are they NOW.Simple really.But we all know this isnt going to ever happen.Either the developer is working on something so big there needs to be a veil of secrecy and non disclosure or theyre running an elaborate long drawn out pump and dump.
