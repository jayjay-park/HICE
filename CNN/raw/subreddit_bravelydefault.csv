351571,0,t1_cfh6egw,I would suggest just trying out both setups and see which one is doing more for you.  Right now my setup is actually heavily focused around Pirates with that Axe I havePirateSwordmasterPirateSwordmasterPirateThiefSpiritmasterWhite MageWith Pirate and Swordmaster both maxed you can use the ability Free Lunch which makes MP cost for everything  for  turns and you can use the Pirate ability Amped Strike which costs  max mana and deals x damage.  With this setup I can actually deal  damage a lot of the time while using a shield even so thats how my setup is I havent tried it vs bosses I might need to use handed instead of a shield to get max damage on bosses.  But I expect you will deal more damage with dual wielding those axes due to all the agility the downside is youll need to use  more passive point to use dual wield instead of handed.,bravelydefault,cfh7hqz,1,t5_2u1oz

3140614,0,t3_2w16tv,I just beat it a couple hours ago using arguably the most cheesy but effective combo I could think of.Tiz and Ringabel both max level thieves with as much P Atk items as possible and both using end game bows with bow lore and as much speed abilities as possible. This is part is critical because you want these two to always move first on a turn. Use whatever secondary class you want. It wont matter since the only thing these two do is Godspeed Strike.Edea was a TemplarSinger. She did nothing but buff P Atk with songs the whole time. In retrospect I could have used her as a rd damage dealer so think about that as an option. I think her damage would have outweighed the buffs she gave in the long run.Agnes is the lynchpin of this whole operation. She needs to be a Spiritmaster with the Stillness skill available and the Hasten World ability equipped. Dont give her or Edea any speed boosts or theyll fire out of turn and wreck the whole plan.Everybody needs support skills or accessories that nullify death as the boss has a onehitter than can cause a little pain and force you to waste turns resurrecting instead of charging up and attacking.So this works on all the final boss forms. Default with Edea Tiz and Ringabel while Agnes goes for Stillness turn . Use the turns while you have Stillness up to stock up on BP with everyone which should be fast with Hasten World. Then  when stillness fades unleash two Godspeed Strikes each with Tiz and Ringabel. You can throw in a buff with Edea whenever youre ready. Finish it up with possibly a quick damage spell with Agnes followed by Stillness again.Basically alternate using Stillness to recharge BP and then unleashing as much damage you can get away with on the turn Stillness wears off and capping it off with another Stillness. If Tiz and Ringabel dont swing first you run the risk of letting Agnes cast Stillness before they strike which nullifies the damage. I got an unscathed bonus against the boss with this technique. If you throw in a couple SP toward the end you can really jack him up for k per hit on criticals. This kills the boss.Not classy. Not elegant. Totally effective. Have fun!,bravelydefault,conisbz,1,t5_2u1oz

What this means is a photo translator will invariably lack the information required to produce anywhere near a decent translation. However it is great if you use it to supplement your own understanding of the language. Its especially good for quickly searching kanji though I find the handwriting portion on the google translator app to be fantastic as well. Unfortunately the DS resolution is so shit sometimes that it isnt uncommon for a photo translation app to just not be able to read the text at all.Of course this only really applies to conversationsdialoguestory moments.

4079999,0,t3_372o4d,Beat the game a while back but this was my endgame partyall classes maxed everyone at level .K Damage ClubBuilt specifically to cause as much damage as I could while surviving big hits from bosses. Only really has trouble with magic heavy bosses in the boss rush at least it used to right up until I swapped in a few choice abilities. Ringabel and Tiz To hell with you default! Dealers of  damage!Job MonkFreelancerAbilities Natural Talent Maximize HP flex choiceI think I went with Angelic WardEquipment Nonebecause Natural Talent.Agnes BP BatteryJob FreelancerPerformerAbilities Maximize HP Angelic Ward Hasten WorldEdea HealerJob SalveMakerWhite Mage. Abilities Maximize HP Angelic Ward Steady MP RecoverySummary Basically I wanted to design a team that I could set up on turn one and then laugh as it tore through everything. I think I succeeded with this setup.Basically I have Tiz and Ringabel Brave X on the first turn then use Pressure Point which bypasses Default and X Mimic which means I dont have to pay  BP for each subsequent Pressure Point. Theyll both run out of BP. However since their physical attack is something monstrousif I recall correctly its over  with this setupIm practically guaranteed K damage on turn . I have Agnes Brave X and use My Hero followed by X Mimic again negating the BP cost. Edea as a healer is kind of an odd choice but her slightly higher natural defense made her a better selection for the slightly more fragile SalveMaker. The SalveMakers innate Healing Lore which doubles the effectiveness of all healing actions negates the groupcasting nature of the role shes in on the team and is a good compromise for Epic Group Cast. The Steady MP Recovery also means that I can burn off two Curagas each turn on healing the party. And because of their higher HPthanks to teh appropriately named Maximize HPthey have health around K which is nearly double the damage cap. In order to kill the party a boss would essentially have to party wipe me twiceonce to get me below the damage cap then again to actually kill me. And I wont have to wait for Edea to concoct a Giants Draught like she would with a team lacking Maximize HP so if I get my two heals off its going to be hard for the enemy to do sufficient damage. And theyre going to have a hard time lasting long enough to do anything when Im nearly guaranteed to deal  damage in the first two turns and  every turn thereafter. This setup has a few strengths that I believe make it better than the traditional Pirate Free LunchAmped Strike strategy. First the nature of the Pirates Amped Strike and Free Lunch demands that you spend every other turn activating Free Lunch to avoid running out of MP. If you try to auto battle youll need to run it every turn. That means that even with two pirates youd be doing a max of  every two turnsand thats assuming that the target of these attacks isnt defaulting to lessen the damage dealt. This team overcomes this deficiency by boosting physical attack to insane levels with Natural Talent and ensuring that no passive strategy by the target will reduce damage taken. Past two turns into the battle my team begins to outstrip a piratical setup. The only downside is that Im not sure how the team would fare at lower levels. ,bravelydefault,crlcg81,1,t5_2u1oz

7397327,0,t3_4glxo2,Since she pierces default with Condor dont worry about default to protect yourself from her attacks. Just brave down to about  if you need to default only if you want to avoid going negative completely. The main dangerous attacks she uses are Sidewinder which hits everyone but costs her  BP and Maverick which hits the weakest person at the end of the turn for extra damage. Sidewinder deals less damage if the damage is spread among more people so try to keep everyone alive or itll serve as a strong finishing attack. But if it doesnt kill outright you can easily use the turn after to revive and heal people.Thief and Summoner are great choices for this fight  Thief gives you a high damage attacker who can heal themselves before Aimee gets to attack and with Catmancy and White Wind can then also heal allies. Summoner is ludicrously powerful when Spellcrafted into single target attacks  Dart Needle Blast and a few others double the damage of Spellcraft just by being used so pop some Good Measure Darts or Hammers at her and you can rip her open pretty effectively.,bravelydefault,d2j0zze,1,t5_2u1oz

7647811,0,t1_d3bel8n,I personally prefer a Catmancer with a Staff equipped for BP recovery  Cat Mastery skills count as  items used for the purpose of item trigger specials. You can thus use Rejuvenate then use any Cat Mastery ability times  and you can repeat the same thing next fight. Just have Rejuvenation ready to go before the grinding can officially start.Cat Mastery also gives you Vigor Tonic which is itself a BPgenerating move. If you set it up right you can pretty much get a max streak going with Autobattle  especially since Catmancy has actual offensive capabilities. Death Spiral in particular is just sexy with  attacks each of which has a  chance to cause instadeath.,bravelydefault,d3biisg,2,t5_2u1oz

Either have one of the ones that dont die in  or  turns revive the team block it with Astrologian Status Guard make a White MageBishop revive mist.

10678195,0,t3_5sqovd,Level lots of jobs rather than a few jobs a lot. Early in the game Prologue early chapter  I take jobs no further than level . Then level  later in chapter  and early chapter  and level  for late chapter  and chapter . Getting jobs above level  takes a huge amount of time and isnt really worth it until slightly later in the game it takes considerably more JP to get a job from level  to  than from level  to .Similarly dont try and go in with a specific party plan. At different points in the game different kind of things work so being flexible is more important.Dont worry too much about character stats or differences. Theres differences but theyre pretty minor. Edea is marginally better at physical damage Tiz is marginally the most durable Agnes is slightly the best mage and healer Ringabel is slightly faster. But none of these differences really matter beyond the Prologue so just do whatever.Do the sidequests in chapters .,bravelydefault,ddhdidk,2,t5_2u1oz

11379009,0,t1_dfln8fp,cool!! so obviously theres a few setups out there that are commonly used for their loopholes of game mechanics like BP batteries and such and these are awesome and effective but Ive always been a fan of building my own teams so heres what I went with DMagnolia NinjaFencerMagnolia is the main physical attacker. She has very high attack and speed and has the support abilities dual wield and muscle memory. Utilising the Fencers stances and the commands which deal boosteddamage attacks while swapping stances allows her to constantly have raised attack and defense and dish out heavy damage with each attack almost always moving first Yew YokaiSummonerYew is the magic attacker which is always my favourite kind!! Travel around Luxendarc to pick up all the Yokai abilities from the sidequest bosses and youll find yourself with lots of high level magic most notably tier  black magic spells the ajas. Summoner is excellent at group casting offensive spells too and now also has the invocation that Conjurer had in Default allowing them to cast buffs. Useful support abilities include Echo and anything that regenerates MP as these two jobs have quite costly spells. Now this part of the build can be replaced with any other strong synergetic pair of caster jobs such as Black MageWizard another fantastic combo but I used a Summoner build just to mix things up since I used Black Magic in Default DTiz White MageAstrologianTiz is the support character healing and buffing the team. You want to equip the prescience support ability to make sure your stat buffing spells are always cast first. You also want to get the Black Mages Group Cast All so that you can cast spells like Raise and Dispel on the whole team at once which is incredibly useful. When you arent healing youre increasing everyone elses attack magic attack and other stats to help you dish out the damage Edea KaiserGuardianEdea is a high stat character that specialises in boosting herself or the whole field. Kaiser has a number of highrisk highreward commands that will do things such as healing all combatants or maxing attack for everyone party members and enemies alike. If youre confident you can counterheal boosted damage or wipe out your foes before they can move these are great choices in combat. Otherwise you can utilise the Guardians possession ability. Possessing Magnolia will drive her attack stat through the roof and will have you hitting the damage cap with ease and if you use your SP youll see some crazy numbers  Shell also has high HP and defense and you can use Mangolias Kairai ability to redirect attacks to her.So thats the main setup I went with and it was really strong and really fun!! Which is my main two criteria  Both individually and as a team my characters were very powerful and had great synergy D So I hope you can take something from my advice whether you use the full team or take some individual setups play with it however you like  Best of luck and have fun!!,bravelydefault,dflsi9v,1,t5_2u1oz
