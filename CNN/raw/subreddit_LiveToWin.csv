9625779,0,t3_5cfjbc,Good question. The answer is precisely understanding. Understand what they did to get that thing you feel insecure about. Were they born with it? Did they get there by random chance? Did they had to make any sacrifices? Do they have some skills that you dont? Not only you have to dig deeper in questions but you also have to make the correct questions. If you see a person with lots of money you may wrongly assume that having money is enough to be sucessful. Thats wrong. Even people with money struggle with life.Ask the correct questions.Also read a book about self steem. The one that I like the most is The Six Pillars of SelfEsteem by Nathaniel Branden.,LiveToWin,d9zkqd0,1,t5_3f2x2
