2078997,0,t1_cl4296a,It still slides down in the door about Ian inch. I didnt notice until I was watching all the different versions hundreds of times to try and pick the right one  that I void Ive used that paint ripple above the t to align it . It s visible again I  about the th frame then extended the line from there. But I was done . Also I set the delay to ms to make it last alitle longer to be readable but when I look at it through the browser instead of directly it looks really choppy.
