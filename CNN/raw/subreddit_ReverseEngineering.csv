337064,0,t3_1xy1jc,Its difficult to respond to your question.  Programs that communicate with remote servers pose a special challenge for reverse engineering.  For example consider the related problem of wanting to play a video game that you did not purchase on an online server where the game itself ships with a code that allows one to activate an account for online play.  In order to break something like that you would have to have some way to forge a credential and that may well be impossible without invasive hacking depending if their online activation scheme is implemented reasonably well.Its not possible from your description to determine what parts of the program are governed by the types of factors listed in the last paragraph.  Its likely that the  discount is.  As for the restrictions in the trial version they may or may not be.The description you gave of your troubles in reverse engineering the application seem to boil down to your tools giving you error messages.  You described one error message and attributed it to three separate tools so its not clear precisely what the situation is.  If youre referring to a message given by OllyImmDbg this is just a warning that the tool is giving you telling you that it will not perform autoanalysis since it detected that the program is packed.  PEiDs message is not very illuminating here as to what the true situation is.  An experienced reverse engineer would try to determine at this point whether the program was indeed packed and likely try to unpack it as a first step.To respond to this question is to read tea leaves.  Its not clear what youre asking or what the highlevel situation with the programs protections actually is whether the program is packed etc.  The concise version of my advice would be learn reverse engineering and then reevaluate your question.  In all likelihood that will take several months at the least.  In this scenario for fastest results I recommend simply purchasing the program if you want to use it.,ReverseEngineering,cffpgm5,4,t5_2qmd0
343619,0,t1_cffwrhz,From my AntiUnpacker Tricks  paper part one The ntdll NtSystemDebugControl function could have been a very nice function for detecting debuggers.  It has existed since Windows NT and its capabilities have been increased in subsequent versions of Windows.  It supported a SysDbgQueryModuleInformation command which was an alternative to the SystemProcessInformation class of the ntdll NtQuerySystemInformation function.  Windows XP introduced the SysDbgReadVirtual command which allowed reading virtual memory from anywhere in the system.  There were other commands for writing to virtual memory reading and writing physical memory and MSRs among others.  Alas in Windows  SP and later all of these functions are disabled.  The functions that remain are for enabling and disabling the kernel debugger and querying and setting some minor behaviours.,ReverseEngineering,cfgdvz9,2,t5_2qmd0

1322190,0,t3_297wdg,First off its nice to see a familiar nickname from the good old aiw times here. I am also really interested in a broad discussion on this topic which is why my reply might be a bit longer than I first wanted it to be p    gt As consumers should we have the right to modify the product weve bought in this manner without any permission from the publisher and as modders should we improve even if it goes against the wishes of the publisher?  We should definitely have the right to customize and modify software we paid for. I dont see any ethical problem with that Note I am talking about ethics here and neither about laws nor EULAs as far as we arent doing it for money.  gtThe obvious downside to this is that we cant verify if the user owns the game or if the found it somewhere.  Although we are discussing the ethics of such a modification here I have to disagree with this. Its completely possible to ensure that people who play the modification have bought it on Steam the best example for this type of auth is the Just Cause  MP mod which makes it impossible to play on a completely selfwritten and added multiplayer mode without having bought Just Cause  on Steam. IIIRC it is using Steams oAuth implementation which is really a fantastic way to check it thus making pirated versions unusable for your mod.gtAs you know running servers can be quite expensive. Would it be ethical to run ads on the forum to cover the costs seeing as that would be making money off someones work?  So I think this is the most difficult question to find an answer for regarding ethics. I dont think there is a universal answer to this question but I will try to share my opinion anyway I already mentioned somewhere above that I dont see any ethical problem as far as we arent doing it for money but if we start to include ads or even sell the mod it becomes really difficult to draw a line between what counts as only for the server costs and already making money off someones work. Are ads okay? Is it okay to let people donate to the project? Should there be premium features? I mean didnt you also work hard for your mod why shouldnt you get some money too?  You see in the moment you decide to monetize your mod in any way these questions suddenly start to appear. In my opinion publicly released modifications should be OSS. It is the best way to make a modification persistent and durable because usually there are always interested people and these people will try their best to keep your mod alive even if you arent interested anymore. Which leads me to the next point Such a mod should be somewhat decentralized if possible in any way. Even if you decide to not keep your project online for example a masterserver having your mods source code published as OSS will allow other people to reactivate your project even if it wasnt decentralized in the first place so it is kind of poor mans decentralization. I also think that ads and donations are okay if the project is OSS and you need the money for the server costs because it gives users an option. If they dont want to donate or see ads they are able to setup their own server which is a winwin situation for everyone in my opinion.  Of course you should be aware that in the moment you make your mod public you have to let go of the thought of being the only person in control of what youve written. We have already seen a lot of this drama happen because people thought their work will always stay in their hands and control and I think you will agree.  Anyway thanks for reading this far.

They had something like a LDS whose resistance would change as another layer of security sensing the ringmicroscopy light or any light Id imagine and nuke the data.Have you tried to use anything like Heaq  LOX  liquid nitrogen to physically slow down vibration of the crystal to clock out data?

10353170,0,t1_dchdi04,I dont know but would the most popular apps be the prime places where backdoors would be ? Like if the governement demands they install backdoors they would probably put it in facebook if they cant insert into the underlying OS.,ReverseEngineering,dchlc33,-2,t5_2qmd0

10690034,0,t1_ddih2xo,Absolutely. I figured as much.This is really cool!Beyond the scope of RE I could see some netsec applications as well Detecting modifications to system binaries without using signature scanshashes. In the case of a hash match but a reasonable amount of suspicion you could use something built on this instead of something like fuzzy hashing. I know collisions are rare but every tool the blue team can use might help. AV pretty much the same as above but you could also go to layer  or  and have deals between AVgovernment and developers to provide the needed information for comparison. Microsoft even releases their source to organizations that submit a worthy application so I dont see why theyd keep their toolchain a secret from approved organizations. For open source OSs this would be trivial. Detecting network changes? I dont know enough about bigO  so I dont know exactly how quasipolynomial time compares to say linear time  but the ability to graph a network via something like SNMP and then compare that to your known footprint could be useful. Obviously things like mesh networking or wireless clients would screw this but you might be able to code a specific knowhow subset. Parting from netsec for a second intelligence analysis could benefit from this I think. Sometimes you might think you know how persons or items are related but youre completely wrong. Sometimes youre right but think youre wrong. This could help clear ambiguity and help narrow down possibilities. Obviously this wouldnt be  certainty but Its another indicator and indicators are helpful. Again parting from netsec organizations like Facebook could use this to do a number of maybe scary things. They could use this to perhaps correlate connections between persons like my previous...uh....guess. Or maybe between a person and advertising subjects. analysis of search engine algorithms for SEO.All of my suggestions are just wild extrapolations on shit I dont know about so I cant say I really stand by this comment. I do think this is all really neat stuff though. Thanks for your reply uDjuzuh,ReverseEngineering,ddiljkf,1,t5_2qmd0

11090847,0,t1_dep4pkz,I should probably note that the creators of the game thoughtfully left a .map file in the GOG and PSX releases of the game. With some spooky trickery and some scripting to fix the broken names I managed to deobfuscate a large amount of it.,ReverseEngineering,dep4z6q,2,t5_2qmd0
