587149,0,t1_cg6um9u,Yeah its hard to say about the getting into groups things...I think it may be different since just about anybody can tank andor heal regardless of class.  I feel like having a couple hybrids is just as good as a dedicated tank and a dedicated healer.Can spread out mobs amongst everyone its probably possible to do most dungeons wo a swordshield guy.,ESObuilds,cg70h4f,1,t5_30no2
595185,0,t1_cg7swl4,Thanks so much for your input when I get back on my computer tomorrow ill definitely be having a move around. Have you played this style in beta?,ESObuilds,cg7xd44,1,t5_30no2
603914,0,t1_cg8v2ov,Well the idea is that none of the abilities that scale of magicka are there for damage. As far as actual allocation That depends on how gearingsoft caps turn out.For instance lets say that I soft cap stamina. And one point of stamina goes from  point of dmg increase Not actual numbers just using an example to . at soft cap. And  point in magicka increases the weapon damage bonus on critical surge from  to . Then Im going to start building some magicka. So itll mostly depend on that.For instance the charge is just that its a magicka charge I can do that without losing out on my stamina to use ExecutionerWrecking Blow.Boundless storm when Im taking too much damage and then Critical Surge to heal up when I need to.The reason for pets in the werewolf tree is that I wasam not sure it would be a third bar or not. If it is yes thats going to be an Archer tree with kiting skills and then the pets. The reason for the pets is more as a Hey hit that instead of me. Plus with the added benefit of them taking a percentage of my magicka off the top you lose less than a character that specializes in magicka. I also read that overload changes your bar too not . If it does then I might change it unless my weapon dmg still applies.What will ultimately determine my ultimates pun intended will be how they breakdown. If werewolf is a new bar and overload is too and it doesnt scale of stamina from my attacks anymore then I will swap my H ult to werewolf and use that for burst dps. If Overload works the way I hope it does and werewolf is an ultimate Which I do believe it is now I will still use a bow in my off hand and its ultimate will be werewolf.Hopefully that answers all your questions and is accurate. I havent done real theorycraft since Wrath in WoW when DKs DW Tanking was discussed as being viable.,ESObuilds,cg8x2tg,1,t5_30no2
606408,0,t3_2102wo,I would suggest putting Power Surge on your healing bar.  Weapon Damage affects resto staff heals.  Other than that it looks pretty good.,ESObuilds,cg979rx,1,t5_30no2
608799,0,t1_cg9f3ge,I always thought the  attack speed was not a straight up dps increase because you get a lot of your dps from usable abilities which do no go off faster due to this stat. If I was to be swinging my weapon a lot then maybe it would be a straight dps increase. ,ESObuilds,cg9h1la,1,t5_30no2
624691,0,t1_cgasnjd,I was thinking about selecting agony. I tried it during the last beta and it had a few problems the worst of which was that you could only hit one enemy at a time with it. So it cannot be used for DoT purposes when fighting a bigger mob. Thats why I thought that Id only take debilitate.I skipped siphoning strikes because I already have healing springs. Just one go can give me  extra magicka easily. And in a group it would give me even more.Soul strike sounds great though. I was thinking about taking it too. I just thought that my build was already quite singletargetoriented so I chose not to pick it up. But I guess youre right maybe I should take that one.I also like sanguine altar. I think Ill take it.So heres build,ESObuilds,cgba0yw,1,t5_30no2
649953,0,t3_21lbh3,gt Can I survive in leather how much damage do you lose when you put on heavy?I think its more so your stam regen you need stam for your resto staff but I dont have experience in that. gt Would I be useless as a healer without light armor?If you are efficient with resto staff and class skills probably not. I wouldnt recommend heavy either go medium or light until you see how your regen is doing no one really has much experience except PTS players. I think youll survive just fine with leather are you solo mainly or will you go to dungeons as a healer? Healers will be staying away from damage for the most part.   You may want to consider bow instead of dual wield but that is  a personal choice of how you want to play and your pop into invis will be very valuable to escape from melee so maybe not as bad as I think...,ESObuilds,cge5ee9,1,t5_30no2
793481,0,t3_237lwx,EDIT Ive swapped Green Dragon Blood for Draw Essence in the DW skill set. This I feel is a much more effective heal while attacking your enemies allowing you to continue damaging them while you heal yourself as well as quickly restore magicka.,ESObuilds,cguh0k4,1,t5_30no2

1575186,0,t3_2c1gry,I find that theme builds make me happy. A twohanded Nord templar an Imperial sword and board DK. My favorite if not most effective is my Altmer Lightning Star Wars Emperor build for sorceror. My advice is try things out amd aee what works. Many people find that having a balance of magicka and stamina abilities is good for levelling. Mixing armor classes helps build all of them. Try all the skills and respec later in the game  Cant really go wrong. ,ESObuilds,cjdq3y4,2,t5_30no2

7629116,0,t3_4jqprq,Heres a guide The guy goes into great detail.Also Altmer would be my goto choice for a Magicka DD Templar so Id be remiss if I didnt point out that your healer could make an excellent dd as well. But if you absolutely want to keep your Dunmer you can make it work.PS. A Templar tank was my first VR char. I loved it and struggled very little with it.  Hope this helps!Edit Im sorry just now it occured to me you might have been looking for something more specific. P Take a look at this ,ESObuilds,d39e17a,2,t5_30no2

9966396,0,t1_db2e5jm,I really like this idea and looked into it myself when I first started a couple weeks ago.  Stumbled across the same lack of stam morphing storm calling abilities as well I still havent really decided on a class yet bouncing around all the options but at this point I am half tempted to just toss out conventional wisdom split the attributes  for magstam and make a Thane. thanks for the post!,ESObuilds,db6nbka,1,t5_30no2

10528452,0,t3_5ovy1d,Radiant Destruction will still be the best execute in the game.And thats exactly what it is an execute. Do not use it as your main dps use it as a finisher when someone is at  health or lower.Puncturing Sweep Dark Flare. Vampires Bane Blazing Spear all have good damage hell even Ritual of Retribution an aoe heal has some nice passive damage.Plus Im pretty sure magicka Templar dps actually went up in the PTS but take that with a grain of salt.,ESObuilds,dd1ijdz,1,t5_30no2

10947675,0,t1_de7awc1,On the SampB bar you actually are casting enough skills streak to repositionAoE stun Twilight to heal refreshing Empowered Ward Restraining Prison that it is up when you need it. I mostly use it in chases and to CC priority targets such as incoming bombers. I find it procs often enough that I feel its always up when I need it. Keep in mind that on this bar you are basically a support character that can heal and not necessarily a healer. Your main goal is to snare opponents. You actually dont want to be spamming Cfrags left right and centre as it can interfere with a DPS who is attempting to time their burst with a CC. Furthermore if you are snaring youre in range to Streak which is often the better choice anyways as it is an AoE. You only want to Cfrag priority targets who are at rangesomewhere you dont want to go. If you are trying to save an ally popping a heal is often better and works fine since it does prioritize low health allies.,ESObuilds,de96bgo,2,t5_30no2
11170492,0,t1_dey4ogu,Thats probably because youre looking at magicka builds. Try looking for stamina dps builds. Youll probably find either hdual wield and bow as the weapons of choice.,ESObuilds,dey5w4z,1,t5_30no2
