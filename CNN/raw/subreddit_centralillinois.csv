3721194,0,t3_32z5vo,Welcome to Decatur OP! The job situation isnt great here but try ADM. Were almost always hiring. Youll find friends quickly. Really. There are some incredible people here from all walks of life. Spend some time over in Mt. Zion when you get the chance. Its just south of Decatur. If you want a good place to actually get a tattoo Springfield is your best bet. Just FYI. Decatur is just like any other town. Walmarts theaters McDonalds and everything else. Just drive around and look for things. You find the coolest little places around this town.If you have any questions feel free to PM me. Being in a new town sucks but I want you guys to feel welcome. ,centralillinois,cqgfxr5,2,t5_2sblo
