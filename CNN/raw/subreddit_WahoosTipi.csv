They explicitly list Indian as one of the nonoffensive names which they CALL THEMSELVES. Give me a fucking break. I get that you want the Chief caricature out but now theyre trying to say Indians is offensive too? Even as someone who has embraced the Block C changeover this really fucking pisses me off.

1312396,0,t1_cih80rt,Context is either relevant or its not. So the cultural context  the differing status of white people and Native Americans  that context is irrelevant. But the context of Chief Wahoo  that hes not bad  is relevant for no other reason than it supports your argument. No. You cant have it both ways.  Im not surprised at the complete lack of empathy and willful unwillingness to imagine your culture distilled down to a mascot with a goofy grin could be offensive to someone. When your culture is the predominant one this kind of caricature isnt painful. Homer Simpson does not for anyone represent white people. Beyond the fact that hes yellow there are a million other positive smart successful representations of white people in the media. If I asked a hundred people to pick a character who represents white people Id get  different answers  Captain Kirk Archie Bunker Sheldon Cooper Lena Dunham. Some Native Americans are offended by Chief Wahoo ipso facto Chief Wahoo is offensive. White people dont get to decide whether minorities get to be offended by their representations.  Whether or not he is offensive enough to the American culture at large is as yet an open question.,WahoosTipi,cih9f4y,1,t5_2sd82

1376644,0,t1_cionz4o,Youre right. I said dont develop pitchers. Our whole staff is just reclamation projects. Look at the Rays. How many of their pitchers were big name signings? They did go drop millions on one starter? How about the As of years past? No. They build within. Maybe you dont watch baseball. Do you know what the biggest concern is in the MLB? Its the constant injuries to pitchers that shelve them for a season or more. So you know whats a bad investment? Spending  million a year on a pitcher...especially when trying to keep your payroll under  mil. Do you know what Kazmirs history is? Injury and ineffectiveness because of injury.Like I said in hindsight not signing Kaz wasnt a good call. But I understand why they passed. Had they let Kaz go and resigned Jimenez...what would you have said? Or had they signed Kaz and he got injured? People bitched about Chiz because they dont think long term. Hes  and not hitting  HR a year? Toss him! The FO has to think long term. Im an Indians fan that understands the realities of baseball. If you sign a player you are on the hook for every penny.

3652652,0,t1_cq89uz2,I hate to trash fanbases but Detroits is truly classless. And Im not just allowing a rotten few to spoil it for me. I have been to countless Red Wings games Tigers games and Pistons games in Detroit as an opposing fan. My dad works for US Steel  Great Lakes Works which is in Detroit so he gets a lot of free tickets to Detroit games. When I go I never badger the home fans. Hell I hardly even cheer for my team when Im there. I stay in my own lane. But without fail I always get treated like shit. Their fans always have something condescending and insulting to say. Ive had beers thrown at me and douchebags try to fight me because IM WEARING AN INDIANS JERSEY. I never retaliate I just take it and enjoy the game. Ive also been to a Wings game where an opposing player got injured and the home crowd cheered. Turned out the next day said player suffered a season ending injury during that game. Keep in mind this is coming from an exBrowns season ticket holder. Ive seen my fair share of opposing fans being treated poorly but nothing comes close to a game in Detroit. Any sport any venue. Theyre assholes. I didnt even mention anything about their demeanor on reddit. Thats just icing on the cake. Sorry to rant but I just really have a sour opinion of that fanbase. ,WahoosTipi,cq8mndp,-1,t5_2sd82

5564766,0,t1_cwmuozg,Schwarber is the possible sticking point here. As much as people want to cast him as out of place on an NL roster the team is absolutely in love with his bat and his athleticism is a bit underrated. It seems like the team believes he can handle left and catch on occasion in the short term at least. As Ive said a couple of times before Id be shocked if they parted with him. Hes their guy basically.I guess if a package centered around Baez or Soler isnt going to be on the table for Carrasco the focus then shifts to Salazar. And yes Baez does have the strikeout concern but he has shown an improved approach even hes still a guy whos kinda boom and bust. Hes made some progress in shortening up his swing particularly when he gets to two strikes and his defense and baseball instincts drew high praise from Maddon the metrics though very limited support that praise...the guy played really well at third and second in his time up here.,WahoosTipi,cwmuyl0,1,t5_2sd82

I have some questions for you that Ive been really curious about.its no secret that the injury to Yan forced your return to the Majors at a faster pace than Im sure the staff would have liked. What was it like being in a position where you are forced to come back from an injury before being able to complete a full rehab assignment and how do you mentally keep yourself focused given the struggles you had at the plate during the first few months back and how youve managed to rebound and start driving in more hits and RBIs?Also when Yan went down a lot of people attributed the pitching struggles to having you and Gimenez behind the plate more thus messing with chemistry and rhythm. Do you think there is any truth to this and how do you build chemistry with the starting pitchers?Thanks for doing this!

9416683,1,t1_d99lz00,That study doesnt do much to change my opinion. Mine isnt based on some percentage of native americans taking offense to either the redskins name or the indians logo. What would the magic percentage for you be?   ? I am just wondering. Also I wonder if you are concerned with the polls accuracy. Its not really self guilt. As i tried to say in my post there are some people who are offended. I think a lot of people fall in the middle though and are more concerned with the image of the city and the team rather than it being offensive. People who are personally offended often try to get the people they disagree with to try and understand why they find it to be offensive. I think that is the wrong tactic some might be convinced but others will just dig themselves deeper into the other camp. It doesnt have to be offended vs not offended people have different lines by which they judge offensiveness. However outside of opinion if it can be shown that chief wahoo is acting as a liability costing the team potential revenue and limiting brand growth is that more convincing to you? ,WahoosTipi,d99moxo,-4,t5_2sd82

Hoffman threw  more innings than Nathan but a big part of that was that the Hoffman washed out as a starter in AAA at  while Nathan was thought highly enough of to be kept as a regular starter until he was .

Could he have matched a  ERA in  innings from  like Hoffman did? I dont see why not.Papelbon and KRod still might have some years left in them. They could move up the save leaderboard they could move down the ERA list.Hoffman racked up a lot of saves but a lot of that was racking up a lot more save chances than anyone else. He was basically only as good as the nonRiveras on this list which is why his WAR total is in the s like the rest of them while Riveras is .
