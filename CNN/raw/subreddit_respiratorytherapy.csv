227205,0,t1_cf4801y,Pretty much this. When youre first starting out it may be difficult but you just need practice. Feel the artery with two fingers and press until you feel a good pulse. You can track a good few centimeters and feel the width of the lumen if the patients blood pressure is high enough. Just ease back the pressure with one of your two fingers as you focus on a concentrated point and then stick with swift confidence. Dont be afraid to redirect but know which way you are going first. A good place to start to feel the pulse is right at the end of the radial bone where it sticks out anatomical name escapes me. If you dont get it right away reassure the patient everything is okay. In the beginning practice on comatose patients if you can though it takes the pressure out of it when they arent paying attention lol.SourceIm an ICU therapist at a busy metropolitan trauma center. By working the night shift I have the responsibility to draw all the morning ABGs so I get a lot of practice in. I consider myself a sniper at them . Once you get good enough nurses will ask you to draw their bloods as well and then you can challenge yourself with using butterflies to draw! Good luck young padawan!gtYes. You have to take a deep breath and take your time. Imagine hitting the artery think positive.  Feel around take your time.  Once you locate the best place to stick imagine the artery beneath the skin.  Then stab.  Its a confidence thing I believe. In the beginning when I would try I couldnt even feel the artery. I doubted myself and I started to miss time after time.  Once I started to think positive I was able to hit it. You will get there. Everyone freaks in the beginning. Good luck and happy stabbing ,respiratorytherapy,cf4apro,1,t5_2ve1a

1559175,0,t3_2c3u4b,PRNs are usually the shifts you get when you are introduced into working on your own. Depending on where you were hired you may have a limit to the amount of hours you can work within the year. Its more likely that you get unlimited hours. With that aside the theory from management perspective of that position is you are a space filler. When the schedule is made an there are empty slots they go into the PRN pool call around ask if anyone can take the shift and go from there. As a PRN you give your schedule people your available days and certain days you may need off. They work around you. This includes your preference for night or days shifts. From the management perspective this is also a warm up shift. It allows them to see what kind of work you do and what your work ethic is before they decide to commit to you by giving you full time. Be aware you are making an impression more often then not. If you say hey Im available at all times then they just schedule you when they can and if you wont like something you see in the schedule and you let them know. Just know that when you come to them after the schedule is already on paper and set it tends to make things difficult so its kind of frowned upon. Usually PRNs will get like a  increase in salary cause you dont get benefits so figure that out. Also with some unions if you take a PRN shift and there is a wage ladder some labor unions give you raises that are Dependant on total work hours worked other unions give you raised based on actual years youve been with the company so figure that stuff out too. Im not gonna lie when I started I loved per diem PRN or whatever you want to call it. Its heaven on earth if your management is awesome. It can be hell if though if your departments management team is chaos and disorganized. Log in tons of hours. When full time positions open up then just apply to them. Good luck and congrats!Edit forgive my shitty English and grammer. Im too lazy to edit,respiratorytherapy,cjbps8e,2,t5_2ve1a

2778992,0,t3_2rt1ub,In my area its not uncommon for the hiring process to take a while and depending on the job market applicants and orientation schedule they may not be starting the new hires until after youve graduated anyway kind of a long shot there but possible. OR if you get a hold of them and express your interest you may find out they have more positions opening later in the spring that may line up better with your timeline. I think your biggest obstacle is actually going to be that you arent from that area. I know in the  states Ive worked in the RT community is super tight and managers are very comfortable hiring people they have seen in clinical rotations. Thats not to say no one will hire you just make sure youre putting your best foot forward and it might be a good idea to outline some of your clinical experience in your resume for example they dont care what sort of tasks you did as a fast food worker as much as theyd be very interested to know what types of clinical sites youve been to ABC hospital is a level  trauma center experience in Medsurg ICU Neuro ICU and Emergency Department. Skills practiced there arterial punctures intubations managing Servoi ventilators etc. Its hard to judge how well a prospective employee might perform not knowing anything about the program they came from. If its a job market thats saturated with well qualified people it can make it tough. Best of luck! I dont see any harm in applying and including your expected graduation date and date you expect to take your boards.,respiratorytherapy,cnjyn6y,1,t5_2ve1a

Score above passing but below registry youll be given the CRT credential. If you score above you will be made registry eligible. Once you pass the multiple choice test and score as registry eligible you then must pass your clinical simulations to earn the RRT credential.,respiratorytherapy,crbn3c2,1,t5_2ve1a

6287198,0,t1_cz3wzbo,Check this link out  and this as well.Bagging prior to intubation isnt prohibited per se but keep in mind that it does increase risk of vomiting and aspiration if the technique was not performed correctly. Ensuring that the patient has a full or close to it reserve of oxygenation through denitrogenation of the lungs buys the airway manager time to intubate. The first link I provided crunches all relevant numbers for you in terms of physiological responses.Like you I do disagree with your physician but for this reason for a very broad variety of patients that come through the ED utilizing one technique and sticking to it as an absolute is poor clinical judgement. RSIDSI isnt a one size fits all approach it HAS to be tailored specifically for the patients current presentation. Intubating a  lb patient in septic shock requires a vastly different approach compared to an  yo  lb. in acute respiratory failure from the nearby SNF.  ,respiratorytherapy,cz4a7rd,2,t5_2ve1a
6812451,0,t3_4927mf,Im on mobile right now but this was a recent discussion between uphastball and I regarding HFNC. Just expand the comments further Im on mobile and cant figure out how.The opinion I hold regarding use of HFNC in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is that the pressure exerted inside the chest however much that is given how variable the CPAPlike effect of HFNC by the device is most likely not enough to reduce the preload therapeutically for the pulmonary vasculature to get a break. There are far better evidencebased therapies to treat CHF at your disposal namely BiPAP and CPAP.Unless the patient is very intolerant of NPPV and you need to oxygenate them by any means necessary sure go for HFNC as a stop gap. It wouldnt be the best course of action however.  Mind if I ask how your facilitys use of HFNC on acute CHF patients came about?,respiratorytherapy,d0ohle8,6,t5_2ve1a
