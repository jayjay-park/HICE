3104411,0,t1_coj01yb,Its better I think although youve spread yourself too wide right now. Your goals should be about  dice in your chosen area of expertise and thats very doable with your sheet so heres a few suggestions BOD and WIL work best at odd numbers. Strength doesnt need to be  so you could drop that one point to improve BOD to . Reaction is nice to have but it mainly influences initiative and piloting skills. The latter arent a priority for you and you gain the former in equal measure from Intuition which is otherwise the superior choice since it supports a lot of skills. Consider dropping some REA in favour of INT. You will also gain more knowledge skills out of that exchange. If you are serious in your plans to pick up decking later I would not start with a Logic under . Warning  a cyberdeck is expensive and it may be months before you can afford even a mediocre one. One problem youll have is your initiative since you have access to neither cyberware nor magic as a pure mundane. Theres a way around it but it involves using drugs and that could lead to eventual addiction. Being limited to one action pass per combat phase is limiting but its not crippling as long as you are aware of it. Your skills are spread a little too wide. Lets tackle them section by section! Combat You have pistols and automatics which is fine but you dont own anything that uses the automatics skill. Consider dropping automatics entirely and sticking with pistols. The Savalette Guardian is a pistol with burstfire capacity so that would be a good complement to your Light Fire which is also a nice gun. Social looking ok but not really good enough for a dedicated face. Negotiate is your secondmost important social skill after Con so increase that one one way or another. Leadership is stylish but can be sacrificed for the time being. Nice to see Impersonation  its a better skill than many people give it credit for. Subterfuge Escape Artist is a luxury you dont need. Palming is fun and good to have but it could be lowered in a pinch. Lockpicking can be improved if you have the points. Athletics Gymnastics could use a boost since its important to your job. Swimming can be removed with zero adverse effects. Technical and such Computer is probably a must. You dont need a ton but you need some. Hardware would be a nice complement to your BampE skills but it can wait.  Knowledge skills looks good. The Engineering makes for a neat hobby and can give you some potential hints when it comes to BampE. Picking up a skill in Gangs knowledge or Organised Crime or an extra language could come in handy. Augmentations consider moving the lowlight vision to contacts andor gogglesglassesballistic maskhelmet. Consider moving the audio augmentation to earbudsetc. Consider picking up another level of pheromones if you have the cash. Mnemonic Enhancers would also be good in your line of work but hardly critical. Maintaining Essence at a decent level is a good thing for a face so staying mostly mundane is a solid choice if youre smart about it. Gear The DocWagon contract is a bit of a waste of money since they dont operate in the areas where youre likely to get shot. Otherwise nothing major. Contacts Have you considered picking up a contact or two off the stable ? Armand could replace your armourer for instance.,hubchargen,cojrrld,1,t5_35llh

Currently Ive called Corporate Culture as a street skill Corporate Security as a professional skill and Small Unit Tactics as a street skill. Considering that Ares trained me as security I thought those made sense. Do you agree? Im open to any suggestions you might have for positives.

9024565,0,t1_d7urkbb,Thanks for the feedback.Heres my revision  Fang v.pdf  Fang v.chumLegalities Changed one language to nonnative.   Fixed the double attribute boost now level .   Revised skills and grabbed some etiquette now  dice.  Technical Issues  I hope this is better.Rest In your opinion would I be better off going with a different character to get jobs? I wouldnt mind too much but of course it would take me a while and someone would have to review the sheet again. In general is there an archetype that is in demandrare? Please let me know if the current revision is reasonable. If its not then I might just make a normal mage.   Spent some karma on money to get a better SIN and licenses.   Picked up combat sense but will probably stick with improved reflexes . Mysad progression being what it is it wouldnt be easy to pick up later and this character is kind of vulnerable to drugs.   Johnny Cab it is!   Yeah I am aware. Will probably buy it off in time but fine with it for now.   Needed extra Karma for creds so picked up Albinism.   Dropped control thoughts. Out of curiosity why is it frowned upon? It was mainly intended to deal with NPCs as a partial substitute for social skills.   Dropped the mentor spirit. Karma is just too thin and getting high composure dice rolls is tricky too. Maybe later with an adept path or something.   Grabbed a better commlink.   Dropped astral combat. There just isnt the karma to be good at it without making larger changes.   Streamlined the skills a bit more social more specs. Bought some low level skills with remaining Karma to flesh out the character a bit.   Im looking forward to using shapechange!Thanks for your effort! I appreciate it as it seems like a lot of work.While revising I realised that I have very little edge. For an outandout fighter Id definitely avoid that but it still feels kind of dangerous. Its kind of hard to see how to find another  karma though.,hubchargen,d7wm0me,1,t5_35llh

9359056,0,t1_d92akx6,Thank you. LEGALITIES You appear to be rules compliant. I can very tentatively stamp your sheet as is. However I have a number of recommendations like ranks in ettiquete for both thematic and mechanical reasons.Recomendations You have no ranks in etiquette.  This both is EXTREMELY dangerous in many places and does not seem to fit the character narrative.  You have might want to shuffle a point of willpower into charisma as this doesnt drop your stun track or drain dice and gains you  contact points freeing up  karma. These might productively be used to up Alycs connection as it is currently extremely low for her importance in your backstory and the place in the world she is put. Mind probe like all mind magic is a potential opening for your team to put a bullet in your skull. I dont recommend using it openly and if you have another spell you want almost as much the change might be worth it. The genetweaked dog embryo would need expensive support gear to keep viable and so probably died as your story is written. A puppy is much more likely to work out. Taking your skills to  is cheaper with skillpoints than at any other time by a significant margin while edge is the same price in play as at gen. It might be worth dropping to  edge and putting that karma into skills currently at rank  with skillpoints to let you get s in your most core skills. Astral Combat is infrequently done on the hub and is horrifically deadly. It is a niche which is filled but most mid and high force spirits will hurt you badly if not kill you outright as you stand.Asides Nifty character concept. Autoupload is flaky,hubchargen,d92btet,1,t5_35llh

10601057,0,t1_dd9d8f7,Thanks very much for the feedback. Reuploaded. Fixer fixed to  initially  due to shit CHA. Ammo reduced and some could be left behind ofc. Some con added  rank for statistically  success the skills D toll. Fixer background was in notes added to contact. Easy breakdown removed. Sensor tag sensors added motion sensors to scatter behind her if needed. Pepper punch moved to gas grenades left behind until needed then smuggling or as a PI used when in the barrens etc. SlabNarco are listed as injection vector.  Throwing syringes are indeed the thing.  Other changes as per discussion.Thanks again for the help and the quick turnaround!,hubchargen,dd9f24a,1,t5_35llh
