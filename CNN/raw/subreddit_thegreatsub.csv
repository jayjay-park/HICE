In TV particularly theres a marked tendency of lazy writers falling back sooner or later on the pregnancyrape schtick. This comic while not perfect does at least lay out most of the reasons for it.gtgtRape in particular is seriously overused as character development in fantasy and its rarely done well. You want to show how brutal and evil the bad guy is? Rape. Need to reveal that a strong female character was once weak and overcame that? Rape. Need to establish the goodness and strength of a male character? Have him save someone from rape. Honestly I can pick up a random swordsandshields fantasy book from the shelves and have at least an  chance that at least one female character is either going to get raped or face the direct threat of it. gtgtAnd frankly its a bit weird how fans of the genre jump to defend their favourite works from this criticism. They start to cry realism! thats how it was back in the medieval period!  for fucks sake youre reading a story with wizards and dragons. The author controls every aspect of the story and this is a lazy and at least mildly offensive copout of trying to build believable characters without falling back on outdated tropes. I wasnt aware of just how pernicious and farreaching the rape trope was in fantasy until a friend of mine asked me for recommendations of fantasy books without rape in and I started to come up blank after female authors like Ursula K. Guin and the occasional Mormon author like Brandon Sanderson. Not that Mormon authors are immune to this either  David Weber seems entirely unable to write a female lead without rape in her backstory.gtgtSorry rant over.The top comment has  upvotes and  downvotes totalling  points.Original Post | This is a generated response. | Found a bug? | Bot created by uToofifty,thegreatsub,chvld4h,0,t5_31amu
