If I recall correctly it had to do with the artist only be contracted for so many books. I keep hoping they will finish as well. All I want is to see Patchwork Girl as well stylized by Skottie Young.

He seems to have gone into this looking for the alleged political underpinnings only to come away with the conclusions that there arent any at least not meant on Baums part. He looks at it from several different interpretations. ,wizardofoz,dfybcla,2,t5_2ucgi
