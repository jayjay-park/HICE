1438752,0,t1_ciwm5o2,They arent doing what you suggest because blacklisting his address would destroy  of the current VRC and it wouldnt give back MP the stolen coins. What they are doing is reversing every transaction since the approximate time of the hack not sure of the exact timeits in the official announcement and I am on my phone.By the way AC did something similar to what you suggested but its hidden premine was coins that werent supposed to be in the supply in the first place.,vericoin,ciwmh7x,2,t5_3198h
1460725,0,t3_2aw4xc,Since all the coins have already been minted you cannot solo mine for Vericoin Blocks. If you still wanted to solo mine a coin I would suggest picking a new coin that shows some profit on coinwarz.com and then converting them to Vericoin via exchanges. However this is essentially what the multipool does to begin with. Solo mining requires setting the localhost as the payout location and some videos on that can be seen on youtube.,vericoin,cizdlj5,1,t5_3198h
