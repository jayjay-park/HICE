50688,0,t1_cek5h9g,So Im reading here that they actually played two shows but yes I was referring to the live show.  If I remember correctly he contributed to more than just A Certain Shade of Green but not in the form of lead vocals. You can hear him humming along with a lot of it and Im sure hes out there playing a drum or tambourine. ,incubus,cek7934,1,t5_2qrsm

1973360,0,t3_2h96k2,Actually what he said was that he hopes they have material out BEFORE those shows so people know the new songs theyll want to play at the festival. So thats even better news. Maybe an early  release!,incubus,ckqznox,2,t5_2qrsm

A Kiss to Send Us Off    I kinda threw the last  or so in randomly I couldnt really rank them easily.  S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is by far my favorite album.  All of the songs are so amazing.,incubus,cobrruf,1,t5_2qrsm

3363837,0,t3_2ymez0,I really like the song a lot but the spoken word at the end is kind of lame. And I usually love spoken word stuff over music but I cant figure out what the hell Brandon means by it it just sounds like pretentious big words strung together ,incubus,cpbpb0n,3,t5_2qrsm
4192175,0,t1_crxn299,gtwith regards to Dance Like Youre Dumb... Im gonna go ahead and call the lyrics socially satirical.Im inclined to agree due to the fact that the music itself still sounds like Incubus.  Its not like this ungodly abomination,incubus,cry3usx,3,t5_2qrsm

4924505,0,t3_3iarjb,it was a pretty good show i agree i was bummed they didnt play at least  more songs i had a good time but i wish they played more Make Yourself and i was bummed Deftones and Incubus didnt do something together ,incubus,cuf9trr,0,t5_2qrsm
5199756,0,t1_cvcqf2c,I actually didnt know that. Thanks! Ill check it out now..edit now that I hear it I did know that.  I dont listen to anything after Light Grenades much..so thats why I was surprised to read your reply,incubus,cvcri78,1,t5_2qrsm
5213727,0,t1_cveb498,Yeah I see your point. I guess saying it was a HUGE reach isnt fully correct. I should save that for the next time someone claims megalomaniac or beware criminal was about dirk. I think we can agree to disagree on this thing. I bet the band WANTED that song to be a topic of debate between fans. But theres no tension between any of them so its hard for me to imagine any of them being angry with each other.,incubus,cveg43i,2,t5_2qrsm
6454677,0,t1_czmwmew,ok...I think that tumblr is a website that it lure to lighthearted style of pics...even and  is in that way!Anywaylots of girls have a crush with Brandon and lots of blogs that I follow on tumblr are full of Brandons pics its hard for boys and I understand it.its true that I have a special love for BB but believe memy love for the band is stronger...my interest is not about Brandon as solo singerbut as singer of Incubus.Incubus are over all!,incubus,czmyf2r,1,t5_2qrsm

10706256,0,t3_5sy04u,I want those lyrics that make you feel something on a different level. Ive seen a lot of bands i enjoy recently sell out with poplike sound and it hurts. Genuine lyrics from a genuine band are all I want. Some albums took me time to grow into recently accepted INNW after actively listening through the CD about  times. Time is not an issue but listening to music only to stop after a handful of plays because it lacks depth is.,incubus,ddk9qz1,2,t5_2qrsm
10772158,0,t3_5u2y0d,I honestly hated Black Heart Inertia when I first listened to it and didnt give it a chance.  I have since recently grown to love it.  Look Alive always friggin rocked. Though I did really like Light Grenades when I first heard it.  It is now my rd least liked album ahead of INNW and Fungus.  Still some really awesome songs though like Pendulous earth to Bella.  What I think was a truly terrible decision was leaving Surface To Air and Rebel Girls off of INNW.  It would have saved me from disliking the album as much as I did.  I could maybe understand Rebel Girls but DO NOT want whatever they were smoking to leave Surface To Air off.,incubus,ddr2i6q,1,t5_2qrsm
10798006,0,t1_ddtq7mj,I hope youre right but Island so far hasnt impressed me with their handling of the band. I mean theres all this hype and we still have no clue when the album is dropping. I guess before July but where is the album?,incubus,ddtqjom,1,t5_2qrsm

11398786,0,t1_dfnjxhv,I dont have an issue with Brandons vocals here but could the musical theatre sound youre hearing be an effect of him having starred in Jesus Christ Superstar?,incubus,dfo1dav,1,t5_2qrsm

11749719,0,t1_dgruc35,Oh I know theyre nothing new. I mean just look at how repetitive Are You In? is and yet it is still a fantastic song. Again I dont mind the repetitive one lines so much as I do that almost every song on the new album follows this structure. It wasnt until I heard  as a whole that I started to notice the emptiness.,incubus,dgruz0c,5,t5_2qrsm
