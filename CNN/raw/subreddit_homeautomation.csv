One of the locks I was looking at I dont remember which one at the moment didnt have a drive motor to turn the knob only a clutch that allowed the user to lockunlock via the knob.

891516,0,t1_ch5frqe,I have used Homeseer for  years and Vera for maybe .  Homeseer can do alot but now that they are porting to HSthey left alot to be desired mainly for X.  I will know more when I start using HS but as far as HS its very good except as uBalls states its double the price of a Vera system.So in response to your questions.... I agree VeraLite with an Insteon U will get you ZWave Insteon and X control.  Veralite is selling for about  right now with  off.  We also sell the U and S modems.. I would recommend Linear over GEJasco for three reasons one they are better quality we are starting to get alot of returns especially for defective way terminal on the masters.  Two they are wire dimmers so you can use them to dim dimmable LEDsCFLs Jasco is not selling a wire dimmer that is for sale to consumers until later in the year.  Their wire dimmers are only for Contractors use.  Three GE devices only come in white for sale to consumers the light almond is not available only to contractors and will not be made in the GE line until later this year so white only.  Linear has White Light Almond Brown and Black colors for all their switches.  OK a fourth reason is that they are cheaper at least in the white for the comparable GE product.  Just my opinion as one of the older GEJasco retailers in the US when they first came out there were like . returns nowadays its more like  in over  years.. Yale are great so is Kwikset.. Insteon garage door sensors are at a better more complete stage right now although I must admit I dont know much about them yet we do sell them but I havent tried it or hooked one up yet.  ZWave is kind of a mess imo  really until Linear comes out with their integrated true garage door sensor later this year.  The solution right now for zwave are the Mimo which isnt too bad but you still need separate sensors and it wont communicate in terms of responding when the door is open or closed you still need to rely on the units laser beams.  Or you can go with the FSZ and some doorwindow sensor but you still do not get any feedback.  Quite a few people use them but they arent the best in my mind because they use a VAC switch basically so it requires some hardwiring.  MIMO is better I think although never used it yet.. Nest is up to you although there is a plugin for using it through Vera I personally prefer a one controlled totally through my Vera zwave compatible.  I program everything exactly the way I want my heatingcooling to be using Vera scenes events and triggers plus have remote control with my phone or battery operated room remotes.  I am using a Current Innovations thermostat which is zwave compatible but its way too cheap and keeps losing zwave radio status better of to go with a Honeywell ZWSTAT.  Thats what I am switching too!For AV thats the only place HS is better IMO over the Vera.  Vera is oneway IR transmit only so you can only send commands to your AV stuff not receive it.  That may be of for you though.  For example you can make a scene that will turn on your AV equipment when Vera gets a trigger from a wall switch but if you want to use your IR remote to send a movie time scene and turn on your AV stuff PLUS dim the lights and lower skylightsclose blinds you cant do it with Vera alone.  Homeseer can.  You would need to add Square I think thats the name? or EventGhost to do your IR triggering and integrate with Insteon or X or via your PC.Anyways enough rambling....Hope that helps you somewhat! ,homeautomation,ch5mbdf,3,t5_2s8wn

1523876,0,t1_cj727en,Youre exactly right about not being able to query the state of the Insteon openclose sensor. I confirmed this by adding it to my ISY and this is discussed in Universal Devices forum threads like Sensing when Garage Door Opens  In short the ISY is event driven not state driven.I can certainly see how this could be a serious deficiency for strict security use cases. It essentially introduces some chance of a false openclosed status. But it still might be adequate for me.For example our house has  windows and we almost never open any of them. So the chance of a false status for my windows seems quite low. Any time there is a window open event Id like to be alerted via email or SMS and Id feel comfortable basing an alarm trigger on it.Essentially to me the value of spending an extra  to reduce the false sensor status probability from say  to  seems doubtful.,homeautomation,cj7amg1,2,t5_2s8wn

1650270,0,t1_cjn218a,I am a long time Homeseer user with  zwave devices  Homeseer devices and  events in my setup.  The upgrade to HS will make me rebuild everything from scratch so why not look into other solutions?I am going to switch to OpenHAB.  It has more it can do builtin BUT i still need my HS system for some things.  OH also has a very steep learning curve but once you get it it offers so much power and flexibility.OpenHABs zwave implementation has some fatal flaws.  First is initialization.  If your devices are not in OHs known product database it will requery on startup and with lots of battery devices it takes over  minutes for my zwave network to startup.   Second is around dead nodes  A dead node is one that failed to respond to a ping  times in a row.  Once a node goes dead no command will be sent to it rendering it useless for OH control.  This issue may be solved if OH supported multiple controllers because my zwave network works fine in HS.I am solving this by having HS control the zwave network.  It will call OHs REST API to update status updates from motion sensors.  OH will then use a HS plugin called Rover to have HS issue zwave commands.  Testing so far has shown no noticeable delays.The other major reason to keep HS for now is its integration with my Elk security panel but I have gotten the communication specs and could make an Elk binding for OH.Homeseer is more user friendly but OpenHAB has more flexibility.,homeautomation,cjn6hpq,3,t5_2s8wn
1716513,0,t3_2e2vvj,Same here. Ive been looking into this for some days now.. So far Im pretty convinced that zwave with openHAB is going to be my system of choice. I think water smoke movement sensors are available for any system now. Sure is for zwave. Around  each or so? You could group all the lights into one group and turn that one off in openHAB. Of course if one of the security features senses movement at a certain time or something like that you can turn on all lamps and send mails and stuff. Google led me to this   Im sure there are others too. What I havent found yet is something to open and close windows but thats another story. DIY would be the way to go.Depends on if youre willing to tinker with openHAB. If youre somewhat of a programmer its pretty simple. Also there are quite a few samples out there so you could copy paste a lot. Youd need a zwave stick or something like that plus something to run openHAB on I think they still have some issues with ARM based solutions so maybe avoid those  or investigate some more.,homeautomation,cjvj1yk,1,t5_2s8wn

I guess it means that there was no point in getting a programmable stat but whatever.The annoying thing is that scheduling is eitheror.  Vera will not set the thermostats schedule and if you schedule it like uthishereandthatthere does Vera has no idea what the schedule is and cant edit it.  In my case if Vera goes down for some reason the Stat will simply stay at whatever setpoint Vera last sent to it.  The advantage here is that manually setting the temp either through vera or locally only remain in effect until the next schedule temperature change then it goes back to automatic.UI basically just makes a cute schedule app which provides a level of abstraction from what the controller is really doing Making a series of timebased scenes that change the thermostat setting.I suppose you can run both schedules and have them coordinate but I dont see any reason for it at this time.,homeautomation,clbkgw2,3,t5_2s8wn

Or did you want to control those plugin modules individually?To control them all at once using a standard Zwave switch with no load might work but you can buy Zwave virtual switches that are designed explicitly for this scenario. Here is one example Theres no available wiring for a load it just takes power and a neutral and sends commands to other Zwave nodes. Read descriptions carefully before you buy  theyre often confusing and they look like regular Zwave switches.To control the plugin modules individually or do anything else really you could install a fullblown controller.

4090757,0,t1_crmeqi8,The Nest is not designed to control either HRV ERV or other air exchange systems.When the Nest changes the temperature automatically there are three features that go into the change any or each can be turned off.AutoSchedule is the feature that learns from your previous temperature changes to develop a schedule for you. It factors in previous temperature changes at that time if its a weekend and previous changes on that day of the week to figure out what temperature you commonly want at that time. It functions the same as if you manually put in the schedule and you can see and edit the schedule on the Nest or in the app manually. Early  On named True Radiant for radiant systems uses historical rate of change data to determine how long it takes for the Nest to reach a temperature and turn on early so it gets to that temperature at the time set on the schedule. So if the Nest is set to get to  at pm Early  On will activate before pm so that the Nest reaches  at pm rather than the ACFurnace activate at pm.Lastly AutoAway is the feature on the Nest that determines if you are home or not. The Nest has activity sensors that determine if there was activity near the Nest and uses current activity and historical data to determine when you are likely home or not. When it determines youre not home it goes into Away mode which reduces the ACFurnace use based off of the temperature you set during the Nests setup. AutoAway can have problems determining if you are or arent home if the Nest is setup in a low traffic area. My Nest is in an infrequently traversed hallway and I have a very regular schedule so Ive programmed in my Away temperatures when Im out but people who have their Nests in more prominent areas tend to like the feature.If you check on the Nest appweb app you can see what causes any of the temperature changes which would help you determine which feature may be causing some discomfort.If you have any other questions let me know and if youd like to read any more into these features Ive included the links below.What is AutoSchedule?What is EarlyOn?What is AutoAway,homeautomation,crmkko5,2,t5_2s8wn

6965278,0,t3_4b3ozq,There are a few advantages of the regular baby cams..  It is a standalone system so its easier to travel with.  You can take it on vacation or to a friends house more easily and have it just work without internet..  Its sometimes easier to just carry around the monitor with you and have it be a dedicated machine compared to having to pull out a phone wait for an app to loadconnect etc.  Baby monitors are always connected and realtime so if your baby is crying you can see why much quicker..  My baby cam Infant Optics DXR has a volume meter on the side so even if you have the volume muted you can see if the baby is making noises and how loud those noises are crying vs babbling etc.  This is great for just a quick check while you are watching TV or doing something where you can see the monitor but not hear it.The downsides are basically what you stated  you cant really reuse the system when your baby grows up and the quality of most IP cams is better.  Our baby cam at least has some different lenses and the ability to pan around the room so it serves its purpose pretty well.Good luck with your decision! ,homeautomation,d15ulxu,3,t5_2s8wn

7060431,0,t3_4ca3ny,The ones commonly used in automation installs are typically the Elk Omni and DSC IT units. Those are well proven and have extensive serial andor TCP interfaces.The DSC unit has the least best protocol but its acceptable. The Omni is binary and encrypted AES if memory serves which some folks might prefer. The Elk is ASCII and unencrypted but it supports both serial and socket connections so you can use the serial connection to make the encryption issue irrelevant. You dont lose anything by using the serial connection since the TCP connection is just a box that the external world talks to and it in turn talks through the serial port so you are always ultimately talking serial to the Elk.Both the Elk and Omni protocols are extensive and solid. ,homeautomation,d1gnsdc,3,t5_2s8wn

8291679,0,t1_d5dylwh,There is nothing wrong with adding the lighting to the rest of the homes touch screens but my point is that it should only link to an existing lighting system rather than being the only control for lighting.  Ive seen some AV companies tell the electricians to hide all the dimmers smart dimmers and put their little touch screens all around the house which controls everything.  That is a disaster waiting to happen.   FYI I only deal with the lighting and sometimes shadesthermostats side of things My systems are all the offerings from Vantage and Lutron.  I work with a Cresteron dealer from time to time as well when they get a house that has a Vantage system and they need to integrate with it via RS and I help them troubleshoot problems with lighting. We have a couple of houses where they have a  year old Vantage Qlink system on the back end and brand new Cresteron on the front end.  As far as the customer knows or cares they have the latest and greatest.   I think thats the better way since Im a master electrician and focus almost exclusively on lighting and can do all the high voltage stuff in house and the AV guys can do their thing and just pull out the lighting stuff out of my system later once everything is running and programmed.  That way if the lights dont work I get the call. Although on some jobs there are multiple electricians...current house has the original electricians who wired the house us who put in the lighting system AV guy who is integrating everything and the landscape lighting guy we were bummed that we didnt get that part but it was a packaged deal.

But you should strongly consider the optional outdoor keypad and run power to it if possiblereviews say the battery life sucks  Siri works fine but using her or the August app to lock the door takes longer than using a key only  seconds but its still a pain   The keypad will allow you to quickly lock the door from the outside   The keypad also will save you from being locked out if your phone dies or you dont have it,homeautomation,d64lqn5,4,t5_2s8wn

Coverity releases reports on this stuff and open source continues to release less defects per lines of code than proprietary software.gtI mean one of the worst bugs on the net was the Heartbleed SSL vulnerability in a very widely used hence how bad the problem was open source software product that had been around for a long time and so would have had countless eyes on it by the time the problem surfaced.Interesting you point this one out. The reason this was so widespread was because so much of the web was powered by OpenSSL. It didnt affect all versions of that library but many shitty vendors who use open source software dont update their libraries when new releases come out. This is the problem that plagues open source. Bad actors read that as money sucking vampire squidlike corporate entities will build whole products on open source. Then they dont update their own products when new releases for the libraries that power their own product come out. That leads to HeartBleed vulnerabilities.You mentioned it before that its hard to get it right. No one is perfect open source or proprietary. But at least in the open source world we have the option to vet the technology. Proprietary solutions cant even allow that. Choosing one over the other is choice and thank goodness we have the choice.Lets agree to disagree friend and I dont take any offense to the Open Source Warrior quip but I appreciate and accept the apology.

Tell Alexa want it cooler in the house? Tell Alexa. Sure you can have things like the Wink Relay not much faster than a phone or a tablet on the table next to you but to me the difference between a cute smart light Look I can dim my lights with my phone  and home automation is convenience. My lights dim automatically. Directly to your question I run a wink hub but dont know anything about home assistant. The wink hub is powerful enough to do most everything I want. Where it falls short is on the Boolean side of thing. If this and that are true if this and not this is true. Here is my advice list Echo  switches  may need three way slave switches GE link bulbs Nest Thermostat  motion sensors Then either a door lock like the Camelot Or garage door control like MyQ.

9692636,0,t1_da7qepx,All due respect how can you design a system when you know next to nothing about how this all came to be?  It matters. You cant put this in a neat package to fit the area of expertise that you have.  Its not like that and there is no one system that unifies everything.  Its the wild wild west.  I personally have installed systems for  years and even then there were many installed systems going back to  years before that for people who could afford them so you can choose to ignore all that if you want and think that this is just something that got started by the tech companies of the day if you want but the history is important. The majorty of the systems prior to smart phones become the norm were closed systems  there was a processor which was a bridge between the devices and the controls and they communicated either through hardwires RF or some other likely proprietary system.  All of these systems also had a way to talk to other systems with a published integration protocol so the AudioVideo system like Cresteron could talk to the lighting system Like Lutron and Vantage TV Camera system etc.   If you wanted remote access youd use a web interface and use old fashion port forwarding.  From the customers point of view it was seamless but all the heavy lifting was done on site  you had to know the integration protocols of all the systems involved make sure you had the RS or ethernet connections etc.  The benefit was that those systems are bullet proof and as long as the equipment was in tact they all worked for decades.  They are all also developing cloud based interfaces to link their systems to the new voice command systems.  Lutron for instance has it.  The more recent trend is to move all the integration on the cloud side and only have the physical devices installed on site.  Pretty much every single one I know has a hub of some sort.   You want lighting? You get your system of choice and it talks to the hub and the hub talks to other hubs in the cloud.  In other words you get a Caseta system set it up and register it on the cloud and then if you want it to work with your comcast system you have the comcast system connect to it in the cloud. You want it to work with Homekit? same thing it connects to it and your other devices in the cloud.  For some things you need to have a hub but other devices like a Nest are their own hub.  Again the reason why I mentioned the dealer systems with the oldschool vendors is that the biggest difference is that you are at the mercy of the the cloud. If google decides tomorrow that they no longer support nest your devices is dead.  If your internet goes out you wont be able to control the devices locally in many cases.  If there is malware somewhere you are at the mercy of these companies for security.  Last styles and selection are quite limited in the cloud world.  The localdealer installs have had decades to improve their user interfaces like physical keypads and come in many many designs and colors.  In most cases the cloud based stuff have an App. So again you have to make a choice about which way to go.  If you want to do things yourself your only choice is cloudbased systems. And youre on your own.  If you have some money to spend and just want to get the finished product and have some control over the scenes hire a dealer. ,homeautomation,da7tn5s,1,t5_2s8wn
9696600,0,t1_da8araw,I was quite surprised by how simple this was. Been using the Hue API for quite some time but I guess I only recently realized that if I could live with hardcoding the bridge user and light ID changing the state of a light is a oneliner with curl. Guess thats true for most REST APIs that dont employ any fancy authentication scheme. Setting it up to run reliably amp indefinitely is trivial with daemontools. Changing the trigger condition to something on the GPIO pins or something scraped from the web is not much harder either.

I was wondering the same thing a few days ago as I was planning on building a home automation system at a fraction of the cost and expensive bulbs didnt seem to be the way to go. I deceived that because I cant mess with the wiring I would make an elegant solution and work with the already installed light switches by simply hooking up a servo to the switch to flip on on and off along with a batter powered esp chip so it wont be intrusive. Then all the automation would take place on a raspberry pi server. Might not be a solution for everyone but it could give you an idea about different ways of going about it. You cold also make your own smart bulbs with some relays and the same esp chip snd some LEDS just depends how easy you want it to be and how much DIY you want to do.  Edit  to ad to that if you have access to the wiring you could also use a sonoff device and intercept the light switch wiring? Just be careful and know what youre doing as you would be dealing with high voltage. ,homeautomation,dbnpxdm,1,t5_2s8wn

10217511,0,t3_5ma12i,I have the same issue  would love to get it resolved!Wink   GE Dimmers using Alexa to turn off  on all the rooms. I find that using Alexa will slowly start decreasing the brightness and for lights that arent dimmable yet  waiting to replace they start buzzing which is a clear sign its not at full power. Other dimmable LEDs are noticeably dim and checking the app and you can see the exact dimness levels its being set to in the Wink log. What Ive done lately is Alexa turn the XX light to  but that will only work if you have Alexa not simply setting from the Wink app. Ive read that with other HA platforms you can send zwave parameters to the GE dimmer to change the ramp settings and remove the delay when turning off  on although I havent been able to confirm that. I have HomeAssistant that I may get a zwave dongle to test if I can send these commands and overall it would be nice to not have the long ramp on  off although it may have nothing to do with changing dimness levels.Would like to see others input as well. Let us know what Wink support comes back with. Usually I dont find them too helpful for issues that dont relate to pairing or really anything advanced.

10220364,0,t1_dbzc98c,. No because ULlisted lighting appliances hanging on a wall are not the same as a wire penetrating a wall. Furthermore they are protected by a a circuit breaker or fuse feeding the receptacle b a fuse in the plug of the light set and c the separation of the appliance by a plug and receptacle.. Again the cables behind your TV dont penetrate the fire barrier wall and while unsightly and possibly unsafe they do not violate a building or electrical code.. Replacing a light switch receptacle or light fixture does not require a building permit nor is it considered a modification of a buildings electrical system by the NFPA NEC IBC nor CSA Furthermore as a homeowner you are permitted by the NEC and AHJ to do anything to your house an electrician can do provided the work you perform meets building codes and is performed under building permit and the final work is inspected as required by said AHJ.

Even better the mechanism already supports limiting which topics are permitted to propagate in which direction so it is possible to reduce your external exposure to just your OwnTracks events.Amusingly to me anyway one of the first two google hits for mosquitto bridge was   Other hits include bridging mosquitto and AWS IoT.  Fun.It may be worth pointing out that one broker mosquitto in the above case is effectively a client of the other and the connection is initiated only from one side.

10400566,0,t1_dcmyo6k,Right I forgot the very beginning. You wont have a huge delay with manual pushing of the switch or with the minimotes just with any action tied to the light turning on. So if you walk up to the linear switch and press on the light that its wired to will come on immediately but if you had a rule that turned on the lamp when the switch is turned on then the lamp might not come on for a few seconds. On the other hand if you had a rule that when a button on a minimote is pressed to turn on the light and the lamp that should happen near instantly.OpenHAB is pretty cool and very powerful but it does take some time to get familiar with.

Sometimes I have to tap it a second time but usually it works the first time.I can also confirm that the door will not unlock if the fob is on the inside. It can detect that its inside the house and will not activate the lock. If you touch the lock while the fob is on the inside it will glow red rather than green meaning it wont work. I often leave my keys in my coat which is hanging about  feet away from the door and it wont activate the lock.
