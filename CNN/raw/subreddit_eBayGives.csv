He woke up the next day afraid to eat or drink or germs or to hold things in his hands.  He was  and lost  lbs in a month and couldnt function.   The OCD stuff the rages the mood swings....  so manic he cant reason out what will hurt him.  Then he swings back to normal and leaves us all reeling. There are definite times he get so manic he hurts his little brother but we take them all to a counselor when we can afford it  not lately so they understand it isnt him its the disease.  He gets ragey and mean but not at people at himself.  Its so hard to watch as a mother. Thats why I really hope they get this wish so he can interact with his siblings.  I hold out the hope that one day his body will outgrow the worst of this  I have heard it can happen just as fast as it came on  and that he will have kept a close relationship with his sibling into adulthood.  He will need all the love and acceptance he can get when I am gone. ,eBayGives,cmrlopc,2,t5_34i02
