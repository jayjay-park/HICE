7037683,0,t3_4b72nm,Sorry for such a late reply. Ill tell you whats happened since the start.The first big thing that happened is that we took over the ERC. Lurking like the coward he was surrendered all his lands to us save for Venice which went to SHADE and Dvin which went to Mallock. We then invaded Dvin killed Mallock or so I thought and attacked SHADE so that I could burn Venice to the ground. The war with SHADE amounted to nothing with no side being able to get an advantage. We then formed the Glorious League with the Don Mongol Khalasar and Funland and together we attacked the Bearpunchers at this point the Don also ruled the Grand Alliance. While we got some gains the Don and the Mongols were less lucky. Reformer and Lungora got married and fr the rest of the story in detail you can read my Speak of the Devil series.The game has crashed by now so unfortunately its only continuing in OC form.,TheFunlandDictator,d1e2t3c,1,t5_3b0xy
