8617668,0,t1_d6ib8oo,Best thing you can do is ignore them. By trying to fight it theyll just become more annoying and dumb with the accusations so I started to ignore them.When I got the BT tag I started explaining that I was on the dev team had plenty of experience and that itd be dumb for me to cheat on the game Im taking part in. Responses I got from that so far are lol Im a dev too hi and yeah sure lmao. So yeah just ignore and play is the best way to go  Less frustation for you and theyll eventually grow tired.Yes Ive been kicked several times by admins in the past.,goldeneyesource,d6it2z4,2,t5_2s8gx

8995322,0,t3_53hims,We are showing off single player maps because theyre included in our multiplayer with modifications to play correctly on it theyre new on this version so we have to promote them. Im the creator of the trailer and I tried to keep single player recreation shots Like the start with Dam and the sniper rifle to a minimum to avoid these misinterpretations the rest is just normal DM gameplay which you can clearly see by the movement of the players and by seeing stuff like Jaws in Bunker.gtGoldenEye Source is a free online multiplayer arena firstperson shooter ... GoldenEye s multiplayer with refined gameplay ...Thats the start of the description that you should read if youre going to get to the download links then you have the tiny FAQ under that text saying its multiplayer only again then you have the pinned comments at the top too saying it again. On our main website you have the FAQ and About pages as you said which are basically already on the trailers description. If youre going to the downloads page its quite obvious for us to think that you already read through all of it and the downloads page is not a place to add Multiplayer mod only anyways better to keep the installation instructions there clean and simple. Weve said its multiplayer only for the past  years weve been around and on every social page we have. If you thought it had single player after seeing the trailer you didnt pay much attention to it or bothered reading literally the first line of the description.Sorry if I sound rude but it is what it is.,goldeneyesource,d7t3jv0,15,t5_2s8gx
