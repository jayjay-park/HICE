45790,0,t1_cejlmm3,There are two definitions of the word dietgt . the kinds of food that a person animal or community habitually gt eats.gtgt . a special course of food to which one restricts oneself either to gt lose weight or for medical reasons.The verb form to diet or going on a diet almost universally refers to the second definition. The first definition is almost always the noun form because we are talking about a state of being not a course of action.So returning back to the original point of the discussion the worst thing you can do to lose weight is go on a diet because you are changing what you eat to chase a goal on scale something outside yourself. Would you normally eat a paleo keto or vegan diet? Thats why the effect is rarely permanent. But if you change something about yourself your perceptions and attitudes towards food you achieve a personal breakthrough which is as rewarding as it is more permanent.,GetMotivated,cejn71e,2,t5_2rmfx

You and I are the same. When you lose even a small piece of yourself to tragedy you feel as though you can no longer stand on your own. But you must preserve. Soon your roots will run deep you trunk will grow thick and you will serve as inspiration to all those saplings that sprout up around you protecting them from the strongest wind and the coldest rain.

Every week when I would go to the farmers market I would pick up one thing that I had never tried.That was how I found kale eggplant all shapes and sizes of squash and really so much more.

418404,0,t3_1ytqwn,The top panel was my life from . For six years I drank most of my life away at parties because it was expected to be accepted in my peer group. All these people attending the same party weekend after weekend for years trying to create these memorable moments they wouldnt remember. I wont lie I had some really great times and some not so great and I think it is important from time to time to put yourself in these social scenes just be smart about it. I wasnt smart and this became my life. I had no outlet. Most of the girls I dated I met at these parties. But they werent the kind of girls I should have been going after and I learned that at a heavy price.  I was depressed for a number of reasons and these superficial evenings being my only escape only made it worse.Then around  I started going hiking on the weekends. It was just a spontaneous thing some friends came up with to start losing weight and I rolled with it. This turned into a ritual every Sunday we would find a new trail. Each one longer and more secluded than the last. I got into the best shape of my life. I could run  mile mountain trails at the peak of this period of my life. And I loved every part of it. Walking in the rivers in summer jumping off of cliffs into pools climbing rocks and relaxing under the shade of the tree. With no freeway noise. No groups of people checking their phones. No billboards no television no commericals. Just nature. Just you and your thoughts. You really start to listen to everything around you. You hear birds singing in the trees as the wind rustles through the leaves. The way the stream sounds rushing over the rocks. All these little miracles of nature you take for granted and you realize somehow you are a part of it all and all these little problems that you find pestering you in society you realize are really quite trivial in comparison to the grand scheme of things. Id come back from those hikes and nothing bothered me anymore. I loved this comic thank you so much for posting.

No matter what you do nothing changes and you feel down. But in fact youre just earning XP to get you to the next level where the skills are evolved there are more abilities to add to your arsenal.Its not a foolproof comparison but I like to imagine that the grinding and practicing is indeed doing something and adding up and that the lack of noticeable change is not necessarily a sign that Im just spinning my wheels.When it comes to music specifically  I think the best thing to do is to just keep on continually learning new things and listening to new things and of course practicing the things we already know.

823754,0,t3_23iex8,Rough translation when I google an English version Peace of mindOnce Buddha was walking from one town to another town with a few of his followers. This was in the initial days. While they were travelling they happened to pass a lake. They stopped there and Buddha told one of his disciples I am thirsty. Do get me some water from that lake there.The disciple walked up to the lake. When he reached it he noticed that some people were washing clothes in the water and right at that moment a bullock cart started crossing through the lake. As a result the water became very muddy very turbid. The disciple thought How can I give this muddy water to Buddha to drink! So he came back and told Buddha The water in there is very muddy. I dont think it is fit to drink.After about half an hour again Buddha asked the same disciple to go back to the lake and get him some water to drink. The disciple obediently went back to the lake. This time he found that the lake had absolutely clear water in it. The mud had settled down and the water above it looked fit to be had. So he collected some water in a pot and brought it to Buddha.Buddha looked at the water and then he looked up at the disciple and said See what you did to make the water clean. You let it be ... and the mud settled down on its own  and you got clear water... Your mind is also like that. When it is disturbed just let it be. Give it a little time. It will settle down on its own. You dont have to put in any effort to calm it down. It will happen. It is effortless.What did Buddha emphasize here? He said It is effortless. Having peace of mind is not a strenuous job it is an effortless process. When there is peace inside you that peace permeates to the outside. It spreads around you and in the environment such that people around start feeling that peace and grace.,GetMotivated,cgxwvct,1,t5_2rmfx

Set an alarm everyday or you run the risk of waking up a little closer to PM as time wears on. Im a big proponent of exercise first thing in the morning.Im also a big fan of learning  something new everyday but that is applicable to my current situation. When I was gainfully employed I had a healthy interest in Finance and Investing and did that in my spare time. Now that passion has shifted to Small Business and Entrepreneurship  building the opportunity that I was denied. For you that could be going back to school but you should do it for the learning and social experience  comradeship that comes with school and not under the false assumption that you will have a job once you get your degree.

1063001,0,t3_2699af,Congrats on quitting. Thats the first step. Its also the hardest. The second step is motivation. You seem to recognize this based on where you posted your request for advice. You seem good on motivation since you pushed yourself to do a bike ride that thoroughly kicked your ass. The final step is your mindset. This is where I think you have trouble. You seem to want change immediately. You must remember the change you seek is anything but immediate. It happens slowly over time and eventually you realize that it happened a long time ago. Remember happiness is not something you find behind a tree or rock but something you create yourself. You seem to be on the right track but dont get lost in the desire for immediate change. There can be no good without the bad so embrace the suck and keep going.     You dont want to go on another bike ride because your sore? Sorry to be harsh but buck up. If you want this change than you need to work for it. If your not okay with working for the change you desire than theres a disconnect somewhere inside you you need to personally address and no amount of self gratified advice from random people on the internet can help you. But if your motivated and your willing to be sore and your willing to hurt and your willing to change it will happen faster than you think. But you need to truly want this to happen. I think you do. tomorrow go out and ride  miles. Ride until your so tired you cannot go a single yard further. Than pick a spot a yard after that. And a yard after that. Never look farther than a yard ahead. If you look to far ahead in your ride or in life you will get lost and despair in what you have yet top accomplish forgetting what you already have. Soon you will have ridden farther than you ever could have seen yourself going. Yes you will be sore yes you will hurt. But eventually the pain will subside and it will be replaced by something else.... Then you will get up the next day and you must do it again. ,GetMotivated,chp491z,3,t5_2rmfx

1277167,0,t1_cid9zeq,gt Im doing the pushups thing in my off days.Well I certainly applaud anyone wanting to do a hundred pushups but take it from this old gym rat Ive spent my entire adult life in the gym and a program like this one can do more harm than good.If you only train one part of your body and thats all a single exercise like pushups is going to do for you youre setting yourself up for injuries down the road. Ive seen it a hundred times.Its like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? Youll blow out the drive train the clutch the transmission etc. because those factory parts arent designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.Pushups basically only train the chest muscles and to some extent the triceps. What you really want to do is train your entire body all the major muscle groups chest back abdomen legs shoulders and arms at the same time over the course of a workout. And dont forget your cardiovascular work!Im proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with exercise eating right etc. is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress youll make.But do it right okay?My advice find a good gym with qualified trainers who will design your programs for you especially in the beginning until you get the hang of it yourself and guide you in your quest for physical fitness. Thirty to  minutes a day three days a week is all youll ever need to do I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that especially considering how important it is.And dont worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you walk into the gym. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.Now get out there and do it! ,GetMotivated,cidarhc,2,t5_2rmfx

1391795,0,t1_ciqg0p1,I was the kind of person who thought that my depression would just go away.  In fact I had a couple of year of some sort of remission.  But the depression would always come back and one year I also began to suffer from crippling anxiety. I had some therapy but it didnt really work long term.    What made me go to the hospital is that my boyfriend left me and all aloneI knew I couldnt make it.  Yes it was a luxury to take  months off but it saved my life.  I really needed to see a Psychiatrist.   I have a family Doctor but shes not a Psychiatrist and my  minutes visits every  months were not enough.  I learn that I wasnt alone and that I can get over this.  I had every day sessions with my Psychiatrist which open my mind to how long I have been suffering and also how much I was putting everybody else before me.  You wouldnt believe how many people are suffering from depression.  Normal people with family and kids and nice jobs.  Military men College professor Nurses Students...  We are so good at hiding our pain.Yes it was a luxury.  When I got out I had to find an new apartment and for a while my only furniture was a mattress.  I was also on Welfare for  months.   Sometimes you have to make a fresh start.   I just wish I would have gone there at  and not at  year old.  My life could have been a lot different.  ,GetMotivated,ciqqqmd,1,t5_2rmfx

1393767,0,t3_2a0fh0,I wont say conquered. Its more like Depression and me are kinda working things out and I have had the upper hand for quite a while now.First off I have to give you kudos for seeking help. Keep up with the medical help and look for support in places where you can expect to find it. Depression is a tricky fuck and its okay to gang up on it! Recruit help.At one time over a decade ago the stresses in my life had accumulated to the point where I was unable to go to work. I had time available to me so I called in sick for a couple of days... It was when I stood for almost an hour trying to decide between sweeping the floor and putting away the dishes and simply gave up because I couldnt decide so I just lay down and went to sleep that I realized that I needed help. I was off for a month! Things have gotten a lot better since then!Let me share with you some of the things I have learned from experience from depressionDepression is an illness... diagnosable and treatable! However its probably one of the shittiest ones because of how its viewed from the outside world. No one gives you shit for having cancer or Parkinsons or even for breaking a leg well maybe if you broke your leg doing something particularly stupid but you know what I mean. But if you have depression they all have their opinions on it. Everything from Just suck it up and quit whining to You dont realize how good you have it! Frankly its depressing how people treat the depressed.No one would say suck it up and quit whining to someone with cancer and telling someone that they dont realize how good they have it wont help them walk on that broken leg. I think its because people have a wrong impression of depression.Depression is NOT something that happens because you are not strong enough. In many cases it happens because youve tried to be too strong for too long against too much! Its like the oak tree and the grass. The oak tree is always seen as the stronger of the two but a strong enough wind will cause an oak tree to break. The grass bends and twists and the wind passes through it. The analogy breaks down pretty quickly but you get the idea. Ive talked with a few folks who have dealt with  are dealing with depression and the stories sound similar for the most part. Yes you have to be oak strong at times but thats not the only kind of strength and your branches are broken right now. Find the strength in just letting shit go.And never forget that depression fucking lies!  It is all the lies that you feel in your head... That you arent good enough. That you cant keep going. That everyone would be better off without you. ALL FUCKING LIES!!! AND DONT YOU FORGET IT!and sometimes the sneakiest lie is that when we do move forward the depression tells us weve done well and thats good enough and we dont need to go any further because well just hurt ourselves again. Sneaky fucking lie that one!Anyway... all this talk of depression is frankly depressing! LOL! Lets talk more about you.Learn to appreciate the steps forward that you take. Reward yourself but dont fall into the lie of complacency. You have taken the step to find medical help! Thank you! Great! You are reaching out for support! That too is fucking awesome. And Im not being sarcastic or condescending here! These are solid steps and they should legitimately be celebrated!Dont beat yourself up over the times when you get pushed back. People tend to talk about recovery as a journey so we get the impression that all steps must be forward. There will be times when you get overwhelmed. Learn from the experience. Its not so much a journey... Its more like fencing... or judo... or a dance with some steps moving forward and some back.Speaking of dancing Music has charms to soothe the savage breast! Find yourself some peace! Its a spot where you can go a movie you could watch over and over again... music is my panacea. Just a song or place you can go... even in your mind when you feel the lies start to bubble up and overwhelm you. Take a lift from your spot of peace and it might just be enough to help you carry on just a little farther.Be Patient with yourself. If you are truly suffering crippling depression the dance will take a while. Dont give in to the lies and think you are not getting better. You are and you will continue to do so. Sometimes you just need to look back to where you are now to realize how far youve come.Keep on dancing or fencing or journeying or whatever metaphor helps. TLDRYou get depression from being strong for too long not from being weak. Learn to let things go. Depression fucking lies! Celebrate the small wins. Dont beat yourself up over the backward steps and find peace! Be patient with yourself.Most of all never give up. If somethings not working find another way and keep on trying!,GetMotivated,ciqzn4o,1,t5_2rmfx

1480658,0,t1_cj1rd51,Interesting but its not really very applicable to Get Motivated readers. This is a metastudy that concludes that practice time isnt the biggest factor in improving performance. Interesting to see it studied but I cant say thats surprising. Weve all known people who were forced to take lessons in something and didnt learn a damned thing.The OP quote says talent is a pursued interest. That implies that being motivated to practice is a key factor and motivation is not controlled for in this study. Go ahead and look yourself  the data is provided in the article in a handy highlevel spreadsheet.Note that games see the biggest boost in performance from practicing. They look almost exclusively at chess players to determine that number to the point that calling it games instead of chess is pretty misleading. So what we see is that people who practice at chess DO see a marked improvement. Practice time over a fixed period accounted for  of their performance difference. Thats huge!My guess? Most people who practice at chess do so because they like chess. But even here theres still a fair number pushed to do so by parents peers or inertia. It would be interesting to see similar studies for video games which arent as wellregarded by parents. But sadly no video games were used in this study at all.On the other hand people who practice at computer science dont see much bang for their buck at all. But dig in a little here this is ONLY looking at firstyear students enrolled in a beginning computer science course. In other words this is a socalled weeder course! Weeder courses are specifically used to test your motivation before progressing too far in a career that you may not like. A large number of these people are just trying to find a career that they can make a living at since computer science is well known as a moneymaking career.The most compelling data in this study is for physical tasks. Like the studies of Olympic triathlon times we can guess Olympiclevel triathletes are pretty fucking motivated. But practice only had a moderate improvement in their time. Biology likely makes up a big factor here.So dont get me wrong Im not saying I know for sure that motivation is the key missing factor. What Im saying is the authors of this study definitely dont know and theres no doubt lots of different factors across the  different data points they examined. This is correlational research. It is not supposed to be used to make decisions by the public its main value is to other researchers to help them decide how to do more focused studies.,GetMotivated,cj1vjok,12,t5_2rmfx

1621541,0,t1_cjiyx1v,You must just live in a much cheaper area than me in my county that property tax would be accurate.  Of course in my area talking about a k mortgage and month rent is laughable that would get you a studio at best but I was using the numbers provided.  I work in finance see these transactions all the time and the numbers I used were totally accurate for where I live.  And not just based on one personal experience as you are using but the average of the hundreds of transactions I see.  So no Im not adding over k in costs that just are not there.  In fact I ignored many of the costs that are there.  I hadnt even bothered to bring up the fact that when youre ready to sell youre probably going to sink at least a few grand into updating as by that point all your appliances and finishes will be around  years old and most people modernize a little to make their home more desirable to buyers.  I also didnt mention the fact that most landlords pay at least some utilities as well as trash collection fees and all those other little costs that go into owning and add up over . years.I didnt say you need to settle in for  years so lets not play the game of trying to put words in the other persons mouth it just devalues your whole argument.  And I said that putting money under your mattress is a better idea if youre going to lose money by owning which is of course true.  Saving money without any interest is better than losing money Im not sure how you can argue that.  I also dont know why you bring up me saying an alternative could be investing in stocks and earning ... that actually is an alternative and I was asked for alternatives.  What was your point there?I think everyone should take my comment very much to heart.  Buying a home is a very serious thing.  Our entire economy collapsed because people werent taking it seriously.  But youre buying something that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars and has many other continuing costs associated with it.  It shouldnt be something you just do because you heard you should.  You should sit down and very carefully weigh the pros and cons add up all costs and not just your mortgage decide how you see your life going for the next few years and beyond decide how you see the market acting etc etc.  For many many young people it will be a bad investment because they wont stay in one place long enough to build up the equity that makes ownership worthwhile.  For some people it will be a bad investment simply because rent is incredibly cheap compared to buying in their area and for some people the rent market will be much higher and its smarter for them to buy.  There are a million variables and they should all be considered very carefully.  An attitude like yours being so cavalier and suggesting its a great investment for most young people is a large part of why the entire housing market collapsed almost bringing down the economy.  I hope more people read comments like mine and start thinking more seriously about what buying a home actually means and its more than just a mortgage.,GetMotivated,cjjk77n,1,t5_2rmfx

1646571,0,t1_cjmppab,ampampamp Signalling theory sfw gtgtWithin evolutionary biology signalling theory is a body of theoretical work examining communication between individuals. The central question is when organisms with conflicting interests should be expected to communicate honestly no presumption being made of conscious intention rather than cheating Mathematical models in which organisms signal their condition to other individuals as part of an evolutionarily stable strategy are important for research in this field.gtSignals are given in contexts such as mate selection by females which subjects the males signals to selective pressure. Signals thus evolve because they modify the behaviour of the receiver to benefit the signaller. Signals may be honest conveying information which usefully increases the fitness of the receiver or dishonest. An individual can cheat by giving a dishonest signal which might briefly benefit that signaller at the risk of undermining the signalling system for the whole population.gtThe question of whether selection of signals works at the level of the individual organism or gene or at the level of the group has been debated by biologists such as Richard Dawkins arguing that individuals evolve to signal and to receive signals better including resisting manipulation. Amotz Zahavi suggested that cheating could be controlled by the handicap principle where the best horse in a handicap race is the one carrying the largest handicap weight. According to Zahavis theory signallers such as male peacocks have tails that are genuinely handicaps being costly to produce. The system is evolutionarily stable as the large showy tails are honest signals. Biologists have attempted to verify the handicap principle but with inconsistent results. The mathematical biologist Ronald Fisher analysed the contribution that having two copies of each gene diploidy would make to honest signalling demonstrating that a runaway effect could occur in sexual selection depending sensitively on the balance of costs and benefits.gtgtImage i  Young springbok Antidorcas marsupialis Stotting or pronking may signal honestly to predators such as cheetahs that this is a fit and fast animal not worth chasing.Interesting Signalling economics | Handicap principle | Signal processing | John Maynard Smith Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcjmpplm oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecjmpplm.

1849626,0,t3_2fp0f7,This is good advice. Im not young anymore but I wish I had learnt how to be myself when I was a kid. I was always the quiet shy kid afraid of what people thought of me always doing what my parents told me never having the courage to talk to that girl. Im grown up now but I still deal with this  I still hide way too much about myself I never say anything controversial I avoid confrontation Im afraid to selfishly ask for something I really want. Its been a slow gradual process for me to open up and in the process discover who I really am and what my true beliefs are. Realizing that Im still stuck up on some old insecurities and still unable to be my real unabashed self hiding behind words and humor. Its a slow process and I wish Id started when I was younger. You dont need to follow the exact suggestions in this poster they are only meant to motivate you by showing you what freedom looks like. i.e. you dont really need to go driving around blasting music unless that is exactly your true desire. But yes you do need to do things are equivalently big in your life. Go walk up to that girl and tell her you think shes cute. You like books  well be proud of going to the library everyday  heck start a book club. You always wanted to color your hair but been worried that people would mock you  you know what to do. And start confiding your secrets.. first with your friends.. eventually youll be so comfortable that you wont even consider them secrets any more. You will just accept them as part of who you are. If you have strong opinions about something write an article for your college newspaper. Do these small things now when youre young so that you will naturally have the courage to do Big things when youre older and ready to change the world.,GetMotivated,ckc2qb2,1,t5_2rmfx

1862503,0,t1_ckdkef0,And? Ask a woman what she wants from a man and most likely you will hear honesty and openness however if a man is open with his feelings and complains about whats wrong with him or his life he will be viewed as a wimp. An example Everyone sees relationships where the guy is to open with his feelings I love you so much babe youre my entire world I hope we get married and have kids. Just a month into the relationship. This is almost always followed by a break up. Instead of keeping it light and funny he goes deep and appears needy. Youre telling me you would date a man that constantly told you how beautiful and great you were and sent you hourly updates on how much he loved you? This is obviously extreme but you get my point. It works during the honeymoon stage of a relationship but shortly after that a break up ensues because the woman becomes bored. OP seems like he might have been emotional or came on too strong the fact he vented about his feelings on reddit is what causes me to believe this I may be wrong.

2022304,0,t1_ckwttly,I see the way that dude is dressed and the tools in his hands specifically heavy crescent wrenches for grip and spark free adjustments on large nuts and valves and what Im seeing is the dude that works on your gas pump when someone drives off with the nozzle still in their car and the dude that works on heavy equipment. Those guys unless they are a  man band typically cap out at around k. And dont even get me started on the toll it takes on your body. The company I work for has dozens of positions that require only a BA and relevant experience which can mean anything or nothing that start at k. And we are by no means unique. So good luck has very little do with it. The foresight to take the job in quality assurance when you really wanted that job in informational design has way more to do with it than luck.The oil field worker who can actually make upwards of k btw would have oil on more than just his hands. And the toll that takes on your body is on par with an NFL player.Sure somebody has to do it. But its nothing to put on a pedestal as the model for getting things done. All that guy got done is walked into the foremans trailer and asked for a job. I did it plenty of times in my s. Its just that easy.

2217547,0,t1_cll9tju,gt Our university system is excellent however.This is unfortunately one of those America number one myths. Only English speaking institutions rank US and UK universities that high in reality its all just part of a bias for English speaking universities. I.e the Englishspeaking people devising those rankings probably went to an English speaking university and they have no interest in devaluing their diploma.In continental Europe at least in my field American engineers have a reputation of lacking a solid grasp of fundamental things like calculus and physics while being highly specialized in a bunch of very specific fields. This ends up being useless most of the times as any improvement in technology renders them useless. They cannot adapt and more importantly they cannot invent. Of course you wouldnt hear about this if you only speak English and you get all your information in English.Ask yourself if American education is so good why is the congress and the senate full of such unscientific people? Wouldnt the results of such an excellent education system have shown its effects by now?

Its a common belief in the US.Now I am still successful and happy and have many wonderful things in my life but I am also mentally and physically healthier.Being driven is a type of motivation but I imagine it is a little like being anorexic. Anorexics are certainly highly motivated to eat less and work out. The problem is That motivation can kill you. Its not a choice one makes each morning today I am going to be motivated to do things that will eventually kill me to serve some hidden neediness inside me.I was needy inside so I needed to prove to myself and the world I was better than.

2349434,0,t3_2m4ola,Hey you can get through this. You can get to the place where life isnt shit. I bet you dont want to do anything right now.Thats not true. Do you want to get in better shape? Do you want to be more outgoing? Do you want to learn more about something? Are you motivated now?No probably not those questions probably didnt magically motivate you. Theres not going to be some magical motivator and you arent magically get in shape and you probably wont magically overcome depression but you have to. Because you cant just keep moving through this fog of a chaotic life.So get started without the motivation. Start really really small because you can gather a little bit of motivation from each minor victory. Make a list of acheivable goals like goals that take  mins to acheive then move on to hour goals daily goals weekly goals and so on. And you know what acheiving these little goals might not make you feel better they probably wont. Youre probably still going to feel like shit because your mom died and I think Im correct in assuming thats the worst thing thats ever happened in your life. I think all you can do is wait not for the pain to go away but to get used to it. So you might as well do some productive things while youre waiting. These little distractions otherwise known as goals will not make your life better but they will give your life structure while you heal. I think talking to your friends about how your feeling should be really high on your goal list. They probably wont get it and they might say stuff that annoys you but they have no idea how to deal with the situation either. Work through it with them. ,GetMotivated,cm23ng1,2,t5_2rmfx

Its literally just noise not music No melody or Beat. Its just distorted sounds pretty much.This may work to ease you into it. Its a collaboration between a noise guy and a rock guy. Imagine this song without the instruments or voice and you have a general idea of noise music.This is the same noise guy but his actual solo work. This guy Merzbow is probably the most well know guy in noise. Hes from Japan. This is my favorite guy. You know how in a lot of scifi horrors theyll have that beforetheaction moment where theyre briefing the protagonist on the situation and theyre like This recording is the last thing we heard from them then its just like a whole bunch of scary tortured screams? Yeah thats what this guys whole discography is like. I really have no idea why I like it it might have developed from enjoying hardcore music with screaming vocals.

2517077,0,t1_cmn3rai,I agree with your sentiment but in reality I would argue that youre incorrect.Ill use my own experience as an example. I just finished nursing school took my last final yesterday and we always joked about C  degree. The thing is C is insanely difficult to attain and is not equivalent to an undergraduate or high school C. Hell not only was the material and pace insane in school but a C is actually a  and anything lower then a  is not passing and with a few of them you get booted from the program. I and most of the students I go to school with do not study for a C. We bust our butts to learn everything and try to get  everytime. Sometimes we just cant do it though. No one no one that got through ever only gave minimum effort. Just getting through school is a HUGE accomplishment with any GPA. In my class alone we only had about a  pass rate and if I go back to the prerequisites which incidentally you almost always had to get an A to move on the amount of people that were going into nursing vs. the amount that graduated drops to about . This is kind of standard pass rates in the local schools.Plus a lot of this job isnt about none of that fancy book learnin and can only be taught or learned through experience.Placement in jobs in this area are not heavily dependent on GPA either. Its all about nailing the interview and it really helps to know someone where you want a job.I guess my point is that a C does not mean a doctor or nurse in my case is a poor student or doing enough to just get by or employable only by the lowest of organizations.One thing that I will add where GPA is crucial is applying and getting accepted into advanced practice schools i.e. nurse practitioner nurse anesthesiologists. You have to have a solid GPA to get in and when youre in those schools you are basically expected to get all As and nothing else.This is just my experience locally with nursing. It may be completely different and I may be completely wrong just my two cents and my experience.PS I graduated with a . and aced my final yesterday. YEAH ME! p,GetMotivated,cmn4bos,8,t5_2rmfx

2583988,0,t1_cmvt70d,I think it comes down to the ancient vs modern view of liberty The ancient view of liberty is quite different than what we see today it has nothing to do with personal choice or the lack of outside impediments on this personal choice. Ancient liberty was a moral obligation to the polis which meant being a direct participant in politics and social life. In my mind because society was so small an homogenous in ancient times this moral obligation extended to being in great physical shape in order to effectively defend the polis. It is said that Socrates participated in a war during his life time the Peloponnesian war perhaps?. So because of this ancient view of liberty I think the meaning comes down to a sense of social participation to the greater good of the community if you will.,GetMotivated,cmvv58b,3,t5_2rmfx

But Ive always had a problem with someone saying the universe doesnt give a shit. Thats attributing some kind of inherent disposition to essentially unknowable aspects of metaphysics. For a philosophy professor especially that is logically unsound. And besides WE ARE the universe.

I would say Elgin Baylor or Oscar Robertson was the  guy.Which I agree that it could be arguable although imo Russell definitely anchored the Celtics defense with his pretty insane rebounding. gtYou are confusing athleticism with skill. s players went to college for  years and developed their fundamentals. Skills like shooting off the dribble were commonplace whereas nowadays that is something that would make you one of the better players in the league.Nah I guarantee that shooting off the dribble is better NOW and is taught moreso than back in the day. It is pretty much required to some degree if you are playing in any position that isnt a center andor maybe PF. Basketball is a multibillion dollar industry now compared to then. So colleges bring in the best coaches and talent to develop their players much moreso than back then.  gtIts Tricky To Say What League Had More parity.  team league means less players get in so you would have less spots for bums . Its like making the Olympics in sprinting  slots vs NBA  slots less spots so only cream of the crop. Only a few team could tank then vs now with probably  tankers.This is where I completely disagree. Players back then were FAR slower barring a very small handfull. Dribbling was horrible and was shite until Pete Maravich revolutionized it in the s.  You say  team league means less players get in so less spot for bums but  of players in the league at that time would be classified as bums today. Either due to their very limited skillset athleticism andor efficiency. A guard today could be a pointguard on any given night if needed. Back in those days the positions were far less fluid in the league. gtMvp races were tight then  u just arent familiar with the names. Wilt averaged  points and Oscar put up a triple double in the same year but still didnt win.You named  people I named like  that could win it today. Also Wilt deservedly won it when he scored ppg especially when you consider the FG he did it on and my previous fact regarding Robertsons assists not being as impressive as they seem. ,GetMotivated,cn6qi1x,1,t5_2rmfx

That said there is pretty solid Basic evidence you are on the wrong track  To put it in to cosmic less confusing oddly enough terms.....The only thing that is actually valuable in this universe is energy.   Once it is consumed it is gone.  Everytime it is transferred some energy is lost.   Eventual cold hard facts.  It is the division of this energy which grows infinitely because it is hopefully used more efficiently.   I think you are confusing value with generating wealth which is nothing more than a way of storing finite value over time.   When you put money in a mutual fund you are not creating wealth.  You are trading for promised value it causes a whole run of transactions that may or may not add value to someone but that value was always there someone else just had it before and it probably took some value to get to you.,GetMotivated,cnpaue8,8,t5_2rmfx

But the amount of useful resources to us as people and the efficiency with which we can extract them and turn them into things that are useful can be increased.  New particles cant be created.  But we can create create wealth by turning things that are not currently valuable or less valuable to humans into things that are more valuable.   This does technically mean that wealth creation is limited by the total number of particles in the universe.  But since that limit is so far away and thus irrelevant to human life we say wealth can be created and that it is infinite.

2843123,0,t1_cnr8bks,Woah woah woah. That got out of hand pretty quick. Okay lets break this down. First of all the example of your grandpa isnt actually good evidence at all. Just because he had this tragic experience does not mean humanity is doomed to tragic experiences. I could point you to my own grandparents who are happy as clams and living their lives the way they want. In a few weeks theyre taking their roughly annual trip to Colorado to go skiing. Sure they have to deal with the usual problems that come with old age my grandma having her hip and my grandpa having his back but its just a part of age and theyre still enjoying themselves.Now is that going to be true for everyone? Well of course not. But the point is you cant say My grandpa had this terrible experience as he grew older therefore everyone has terrible experiences as they grow older.gtEventually it becomes pointless lingering because were slaves to our egos.Speak for yourselfgtThe world eventually turns on everyone.In that everyone eventually dies? Because if so thats kind of a given and if not I fail to see how you could reach that conclusion.gtYou dont get anything but survival out of it anymore but the abyss is terrifying so linger you must.Okay you need to specify what youre talking about here. If you mean past your prime then that certainly isnt true. Plenty of people get plenty out of life well into old age. If you mean decrepit physically unable to do anything stuck in a hospital bed then there are a few things issues. First of all people are mostly in this state for a year or less rarely more than a few years. Its not like everyone spends the last  years of their life unable to leave a hospital room. Second of all it doesnt happen to everyone. Some people are relatively healthy and then an issue comes up and they pass within a few days or a week. No prolonged I cant do anything but I feel like I must keep going kinda thing. Not to mention people can still get things out of life when theyre in this kind of condition often from being with family or what have you.gtIf you really want to be remembered as a champion always the best thing to do is blow your brains out once you know youve achieved your greatest success. That way history cant taint you by showing what happened to you due to age.I cant think of a champion type figure that I lost respect or reverence for because I found out they got old. Nor can I think of any such figure that public opinion soured for simply because they suffered the symptoms of growing old. Hell this very thread were talking about Ali whos seriously illdo you seriously think people dont respect him now because of this? Do you think people still dont view him as one of the greatest boxers of all time if not the greatest simply because he had the nerve to grow old?Maybe you personally cant come to terms with these kinds of figures aging but that doesnt mean the rest of the world feels that way.,GetMotivated,cnr9eyk,1,t5_2rmfx

I was seriously the shit. Multiple times throughout my life. Even though I always fucked up. Even though I got my GED at  and moved out. I had many great opportunities to make great money... But I never cared. I always cared about the NOW.  times I had apprenticeship jobs for careers in which I would be making like k. Great for someone with a GED and who never took school too seriously I lost my opportunity for a great job with my TS clearance. Then went to a shitty trade school and got a decent trade... But that got screwed up too. All because I only lived for the now. Now that Im .. Going on . Im forced to watch the retards I went to school with live great lives. Only a handful of people I really considered my friends are now living really great lives... For them... Im glad... But it still hurts. Knowing I could have been so much better.I ended up homeless for like  months. But I was working  jobs. I have this ability to get a job... Even though its for shit jobs... Im gratefulAnyways... I have  part time jobs now. Just got a rd. Shit jobs that just get me by. But its better than being homeless. But I look at myself in the mirror every day and ask myself if the struggle will ever end. Take it from a fuckup that has had life give him multiple chances and thrown them away.

The boys toys include things like action figures but they also have chemistry sets legos hot wheels tracks they can build and customize and so much else. The girls toys are almost completely Barbies and doll houses.Girls arent typically introduced to math science and engineering concepts as something fun to do or fun to play with. When these girls start to grow up a lot of them start having trouble with classes like geometry because they dont have the same spatial visualization skills that boys get playing with blocks and legos. This affects their selfworth and their desire to continue with math and science. I had the chance to present an introduction to programming concepts to a group of middle school girls. These girls had been encouraged to explore math and science by their teachers but only one out of  of them had any interest in doing anything with math or science.

If so you do realize we live on a finite planet and growth forever is impossible.My point really is when does this stupidity end? What is the point of economics?

3146393,0,t3_2w4kkq,I look at motivation very differently. Its absolutely core and nourishing. It is the the fuel that comes from desire wanting to be better than we are. This fuel needs an engine to burn it and produce results. That engine is discipline. With a little fuel and an efficient engine you get good results. With a lot of fuel you can do great things. Motivation is that fuel. Find it. Hoard it. Desire to achieve. And tune your engine of discipline continuously so that even on the down days youre chugging out the effort needed to achieve.,GetMotivated,coo4c8e,2,t5_2rmfx

That is the best motivation I have found to keep improving myself so the next one actually appreciates it.I am going to respectfully disagree with all of that. First just because she badly wanted you to stay doesnt mean she lost the best thing in her life...Ive seen  year olds go off the deep end over really minor things. The best things in her life could still well be her parents or her own life or her dreams or health or a lot of things that arent only you get over yourself a bit.

3347715,0,t1_cp9usmn,But for every Bill Gates there are loads of people who spend hours and hours coding who perhaps make a decent wage relative to the average but thats all.Besides which coding a lot and sleeping little is not hard work  its the exact opposite of working hard for a living.Programming is a cushy job.Spending hours and hours coding is not what made Bill Gates successful. DOS was a product they bought and windows is after all notorious for how crap it was when first released. Similarly with early MS office stuff. The quality of code that MS create that made Bill Gates a billionaire was dire. Some of it got better eventually but they sucked at coding.I glanced at Forbes recent list of young billionaires and a lot of it is really just unbelievable that people would throw money at them  e.g Windows was shit but people bought it. Other young billionaires are people like snapchat founders and so on. Minecraft. Facebook. Uber. Minecraft is not the work of genius. Neither is facebook or snapchat.They are really pretty ordinary things imo. Although some of these things make money from advertising and so on you can become a billionaire these days just based on bullshit valuations without making a penny.Really it boils down to what is popular  and since the world isnt full of geniuses its generally speaking mundane things that become popular. e.g minecraft is anything but the most complicated or sophisticated game. Its just hugely popular. That was down to luck. Steam is full of indie games a few of which make nothing a few of which probably make a reasonable living for their author. One or two might create millionaires and spawn sequels that do well. And then perhaps one that makes billions. But theres really no significant difference between the people that  create these games. Sure some will suck but the difference between making millions with a game or . billion? Pure luck. Notch never expected in a million years that minecraft would be successful.Ive no doubt anyone that makes billions would thereafter struggle with their ego and narcissism convincing them that the things they did were responsible for their huge success.

I understand what you mean I just find it arrogant to assume that you will continue to get nothing from booksexploring other cultures and that there is no reason to continue... Its not really that books are the higher source of knowledge or truth its more about continuing to be open about maybe being a bit more humble and open to the idea that maybe you can learn something where you least expect it. I agree with the idea of learning from our life experiences  of enriching our lives and those of others. But think about that lifetime how short it is in comparison to the ages of human experience compounded in books and literature it sounds rather wasteful to assume that you cant get anything out of it.

My close friend passed away when he was  and I was so overcome by my own emotions at his illness that I didnt know how to be there for him. Im not sure about yourself but he was treated in the paediatric wing.  He was so brave and kept what he was going through to himself to protect the feelings of everyone else around him from worrying. He slipped so fast....I couldnt react. He wrote a letter of thanks that I didnt see until after he passed. It basically evoked the same emotions as youres. Not pity but empowerment. I want you to know how important that is. In his letter of thanks my friend expressed his desire that his life would not be in vain if it were to create a better future for the  other childhood cancer patients at any given time. In Canada we have improved to about an  success rate in pediatric oncology outcomes this is still far too high. His family has rallied tremendously and we host an annual community fundraising event in his honour that goes to support a National Rider in the Sears National Kids Cancer Ride every year Coast to Coast against cancer foundation  donation model. The bike ride goes from coast to coast visiting paediatric oncology centres and families all along the km journey the families and youth affected are always overwhelmed to know that people are out there trying to help create solutions and you should know too. youre not alone. were all here with you and dedicating parts of our lives to see an end to childhood cancer.His brother did the ride last year and raised nearly  I rode this year and raised nearly as much. We did a bike ride this past fall with a young girl !l that swam across lake erie to raise funds for camp trillium she raised over ! our generation will not lie down we will stand up!I wish you the happiest and most fulfilling life you can live with the time you have laugh loud love with the entirety of youre being and continue to spread awareness to this topic.

He failed to stabilize a snatch and instead of bailing forward with the bar falling behind him he bailed the same direction as the bar. if you pay attention to the video you can see the bar hits his shoulders at about the same time his ass hits the ground compressing his spine and causing his injury.not caused by crossfit caused by an accident that happened when he was in the heat of the moment in a competition this happens in any competition in any sport and trying to land a snatch that he shouldve bailed at from the get go.the other athlete was hurt doing something stupid. He and all the other competitors should have taken one look at the hurdles and said fuck no Im not doing that why they agreed to go through with the event is beyond me. Its an easy way to get hurt and its events like that that give crossfit a bad name. My thoughts on the event aside I do still wish anyone hurt from that event has a speedy recovery. accidents and injuries suck.when done at a good affiliate with good coaches crossfit can be a good workout its only when shitty coaches combined with people who dont listen to their bodies and reason that it becomes bad but that happens in any sportactivity.,GetMotivated,cpwcwuv,4,t5_2rmfx

3842136,0,t3_34en9c,This image as well as the other common image that portrays a BossLeader relationship are images that mean different things depending on who you are and what job roles youve had.  If you work in management and look at this image you look at this image as a whole meaning that you see  employees who are all working to the top.  Some employees are able to climb themselves up with little or no motivation represented by the  people near the top on the left hand side.  The  employees on the right represent the employees that have the potential to make it to the top but need help to gain their full potential.  This is why a leader was put in to help bring these people up to speed.  The last employee the one falling represents the hard decisions about having to let employees go or fire them and the repercussions of what the means.  In short this is the boss successfully managing a team. If you dont work in management you look at this image and see an us versus them depiction.  You see two different teams of  employees where the boss looks like hes only out for himself and the leader is the one helping the employees along.,GetMotivated,cqu8k1q,19,t5_2rmfx

You said that crossgender violence proved that women were being victimized. I showed you stats that showed how many more men are being victimized so it couldnt be a gender component. gt Again the link you provided doesnt support a rebuttal to my assertion. Of course you dont think it does youre trying to form an ideological argument.

Mind they arent necessarily without an agenda but I think its good to sample a few before drilling down.Ive of the general opinion that human suffering has just been outsourced very well this century and that raw numbers are definitely not a good indicator of where humanity is going in the future. Were in a lull when it comes to mass death but weve got all the systems in place to make it happen again and again and again. The major criticism of the book is that he provides little evidence of how violent or distant ancestors where he just assumes it.

3931822,0,t3_35exnl,OP sounds like he has a heart of gold something no one can buy and no one can give to another. A little bit about myself I had all the success one could wish for ahead of me. I attended the U.S. Air Force Academy I dropped out because I thought I wasnt good enough and frankly I hated my life there. I fell into drug abuse and after a few years of pills I ended up mainlining heroin. I hid my addiction I hid my life from all prying eyes and one by one cut out any friends I had and lived in utter emotional isolation. After a year long relapse I am now sober three years. But I still dont have friends and I hesitate to even think of reaching out to my old friends to reconnect because I feel like I am a loser.  years old waiting tables and finally going back to school for nursing sometimes I look around and think the battle for all of the stuff I never wanted is already lost nice job nice house nice wife nice children.I turn to spirituality for help mostly eastern stuff like buddhism and Hinduism. I take refuge in awareness in consciousness that never recedes and contains all. But some days are hard and OP persevere and be friends to all through your innate compassion and empathy. You are closer to realization than your socalled friends because you can actually identify with others outside of your ego and so embrace the with an attitude of forgiveness. ,GetMotivated,cr4goi2,1,t5_2rmfx

But to save you the cheesiness Ill just share my experience with video game addiction.Iv been there playing more and more video games while simultaneously not enjoying it. Theres something you have to realize about getting off the computer and trying something new gt it will not be enjoyable at first. Say you start reading a book. You sit down one day and commit to reading for an entire hour. Im not going to sugar coat it it will be the longest  boringest hour. But you gotta push through and just read the damn book. Reading probably wont be fun the next day either but maybe the next day you will get some enjoyment from it. The next day thereafter will bring you slightly more enjoyment and entertainment and ever so gradually reading will become fun.

The thing is society as a whole generally doesnt give a shit about quadriplegics and as Maddox pointed out in his gratuitously shocking article Christopher Reeve may well have fit into that category before his accident.  I know that I had certainly fit into that group before Christopher Reeve brought awareness to paralysis.  Well it might be unfair to say I didnt give a shit but more like I didnt think about it.Paralysis is something that society should not abide and we should be doing everything in our power to stamp it out along with every other disease or condition that looks to rob us of our life and vitality.  It is because of Christopher Reeve that I now think that way and I have become a regular contributor to the fund that he set up a fund which searches for a cure and works to improve the quality of life for thousands of people who arent Christopher Reeve though it is fair to say that he would have benefitted from a cure had he lived.

4450646,0,t3_3c1gwm,So I dont know if this qualifies but the TLDR of my story is I was a success in high school. Good grades even though I under achieved did sports and was going to go to college to wrestle. End of senior year in high school I had career ending injuries. Lost my scholarship well technically t there was only talk of a scholarship went to my rd choice school. Has trouble walking for years after the injury. The forced sedentary life style mixed with drinking and a bad break up with my then gf lead me down a path of depression. I almost flunked out my first year. Scrapped by the next few years. All the while I was physically getting worse from a lack of exercise and alcoholism. Fat sick and defeated I left school... Im not sure why but after about half a year I went back finished my last semester. Barely graduated and spent the next year trying to sober up while working a minimum wage job. Then I moved finally sobered up and found a job in my field at the beginning of this year. Been sober really glad I got this job and started trying to work out again. Things are not great and my lifebody are still shitty from the years of self destruction but if I keep my job for s couple years... no one will care about my shit gpa and maybe Ill stick with working out and get back to a reasonable weight by the end off the year. it gets better...But you can wait for it you have to seek it out and pretend you arent depressed. Crawl outta bed and smile and things might just turn around. And the sadness gets buried. Maybe even goes away....I dont know about that part of have to tell you in a year or so if it does...If I had any advice to give maybe try a change of scenery. The move really helped me. New place means a new you. Go do a meet up or two fund a new hobby that takes you outside. New things seem to make life better and dont look back. I fucked up so many tests. It doesnt even matter no one cares as much as you do about your stuff because everyone else has just as much insecurity as you. Find peace of mind in that its not that you arent important its that people arent just sitting there watchingjudging you... more than likely they are spending most of their time wondering if you are judging them.

Solution  humility respect Hearts and minds and practice whatever youre doing do drills typing then type at home. everyone gets better with experience so go and grind. Get good enough and you wont need guiding you wont be a burden.That research thing is a classic sign of the modern age. you looked online but did you pick up a phone? now I hate phoning people but occasionally you have to get what you need. Point being initiative! remember nobody else really knows what theyre doing either. act like its whats supposed to happen and people will start following your lead. You are the master of your own destiny and it is your destiny to get whatever your current task is done!Everyone hates office printers its a thing.This boss.

Operation Be Direct  tell her you can hear what she is saying tell her you do not appreciate her lack of professionalism and then explain you havent had time to learn enough to be unprofessional but she has my idiot point but nicer.. Operation Rise above it. ignore and develop your work and let that speak for itself if you hear them talking smack try to arrange to walk in on them then just lift your eyebrows and silently walk away effective use of silence makes everyone feel uncomfortable. the second bit is optional but Im Irish guilt is a weapon.Either one will make people look at you differently  is faster but  is safer.

Youre right in that he was simply doing an interview and not espousing himself as motivational but Ill disagree with you that this doesnt have the same ring to it as someone with still a hard life I also disagree with the notion that the fact that he is professional successful means his life is now easy.  Assuming that he is compensated enough that he could live a lavish lifestyle he is willingly choosing not to and relishing in the simple things in life and appreciating his good health.  Now if we look at someone who lives a similar simple life but not out of choice but due to circumstance then the story really then becomes I can only have simple things yet still find happiness in them.  One individual is making the best of their situation which is definitely commendable as many people will take stock of their situation and always want more.

5033624,0,t3_3juesq,Learn to not be afraid of fucking up. The only surefire way to never make mistakes is to never try at all  and thats a habit thats really really easy to fall into without even realizing it.My solution to this was to accept that mistakes and even failure are an inevitability. Once I started to acknowledge that failure was a possibility I could plan to compensate for it  but most importantly I was no longer afraid to try for fear of fucking up. It might not work for everyone but this mindset helped me so much. Six months ago I had a dead end job that I hated but never applied for other work because I was too afraid that my resume wouldnt be perfect. I was so afraid of messing up my applications that I could never bring myself to start writing them in the first place.At some point I started forcing myself to stop agonizing over my resume and just send applications and emails off even if I didnt feel they were just right. I just kept giving every application and interview my best shot and accepting that that might not be enough and that was okay  another position would come along I just have to keep on looking. Fast forward a few months and now I live on the other side of the country I got myself out of a toxic relationship and Im on track to getting a Masters in Neuroscience. I fuck up every now and then and its okay.,GetMotivated,cusqr8o,2,t5_2rmfx
5034479,0,t1_cusua2v,If you have a refrigerator I usually have fruit with a turkey sandwich for lunch fruit meaning an apple and an orange I mean if money is tight there are alternatives instead of Ramen have Campbells or Progresso soup? It may not be the absolute best thing to eat but I know I personally can pop the lid and eat those without cooking. Also if you could hardboil a dozen eggs at a friends house there is breakfast for ish days I usually eat just the whites  eggs a day. The issue with a lot of the quick microwave stuff is it tends to be packed with sodium. You can partially offset that by over hydrating though it isnt the greatest but it is a solid alternative if you cant cook chickenfish. Tuna fish I buy starkist in individual packets but the cans are cheaper is a good alternative for lunch meats.

5122497,0,t1_cv19ign,Its sounds like you have a good job which is nice. Most people dont choose a job and then do it. Mostly they end up having to find a way to pay the bills when a family arrives and then spend fifty years having most of each week spent with their work colleagues and not with those they love. If you were to change jobs or get a new car or start life in a new country you would probably be wise to google the subject to get advice from those whove done it before. Just because people have knowledge of their approaching death doesnt mean they are mentally incompetent and full of gobbledygook. Sorry to be the one to tell you but virtually everyone dies from a terminal disease unless you have a fatal accident or commit suicide. However it is you eventually die will be by definition terminal and terminal conditions tend not to appear one afternoon and finish you off by bed time. Death from natural causes is usually an organ failure from a disease at present its normally heart disease or cancer. Conditions like that will not usually sneak up on you in the night. There will most likely be years of signs and symptoms. Yes some deaths are sudden but most have warning and the individual gets to consider their situation. We have decades of data on the subject. I think the motivation behind what they said was that the most valuable thing in life is time spent with those whom you love. I think the non terminal would generally agree.  To maximise on this often means spending less time with your boss and work colleagues. But nobodys trying to tell you what to do. Maybe your life is simply well balanced already.  ,GetMotivated,cv3gb5p,1,t5_2rmfx

The bad news is that the feeling never goes away  the fear. The good news is that the feeling diminishes the more you get on stage and perform. My two cents would be this embrace the possibility of failure but give it everything youve got. Be  confident in what you have prepared timing material appearance etc.. Best case scenario you knock them dead. Worst case scenario youll learn a ton and knock them dead next time.

For a moment this man is transported back to his youth and is maybe thinking about a girl he was going to see or excitement at first opening his barber shop.

5359540,0,t3_3ofdjl,Day Two  It sucks being in the house alone during the day. Im looking for work and am trying to find anything to distract myself. There is the constant thought of cigarettes back again. As the day progresses I find myself snacking on bits. Not too much as I really dont want to be putting on weight but yeah the appetite has increased. The taste remains the same but Im hungry!My hands dont smell anymore but Ive got sort of sniffles. Not really a runny nose but blocked and annoying. Everything is annoying though!!Im a rational and logical person Ive just graduated from a science degree but I cannot explain why I just got so pissed off at the refrigerator. I closed it and immediately remembered something else on the side that needed putting back in concentration again. It stopped me from opening it how fucking dare it!! The auto seal took a few seconds but the scene was like this. Imagine finding Thors hammer Mjolnir imagine trying to lift said hammer with the determination of a future king of Asgard. Flip it through  degrees and Im my mind I wanted to destroy that fking refrigerator. I had simply forgotten to put the milk away. My partner came home and we went shopping. On returning I needed to make a point that as we are both simultaneously on the defensive and attack that we cannot prejudge every point the other is making as coming from a nicotine depraved mental state. This is tricky as we are both like wtf shit youre moody as fuk tonightAgain sleep cannot come quick enough. ,GetMotivated,cvwqpmk,2,t5_2rmfx

5518955,0,t1_cwh0l3o,Your brain is a soup of chemicals just like mine just like everybody elses and youd be surprised how many of the feelings you experience are associated to that. Even the feeling of not having mental energy to put yourself in action mode comes from low levels of certain chemicals.We quickly categorize people as being depressed hyperactive ADHD paranoid etc... When the levels of this chemicals or behaviors surpass what we understand as the normal value. But its very likely that nothing is really wrong with you just that you are in need of some self love. And the first step is always the hardest step.Dont feel discouraged because you dont have the mental energy to take this first step this is your quest your life battle and the difficulties associated to it relate exclusively and directly to you your story has brought you to where you are and your brain soup is unique to you and your experiences.    The best advice that in can give you is to be aware of this fact you are in control of how you place the sail of your boat but not of the way the wind blows. You can make the best out of your situation now by battling against the wind and putting the little energy you have into that sail. And the changes might be minute but little by little probably without you even realizing your serotonin and dopamine levels will begin to rise and your mental energy will become stronger like a snowball effect.TL.DR Fake it till you make it.,GetMotivated,cwh3hjk,7,t5_2rmfx

I really do need to get out of the house and do other things  but all I can think about now is heading to the beach and jumping off the pier. I was thinking of going there just to remind myself that there is always this route to take  and it would somehow be comforting.The last time I was there it was so terrifying. I dont know if Ill ever muster up the courage to jump but I hope I never do. There is so much more to life. This persist low mood and lack of feeling any pleasure antidepressants have numbed the pleasure centre in my brain just adds to it. All I feel is numbness. I am seeing my psychiatrist next week to assess that and possibly change my medication. The sideeffects have been quite terrible even anxiety feeling on edge. I hate that there always has to be a trial and error with these things and the next one I try could make me feel worse.I just want everything to go away. The pain atleast... The void that I currently have in my life that I previously filled with people who I was unhealthily dependent on. Theyve distanced themselves from me.

There is so much stability and safety in our lives and especially those of our parents that a lot of people find it not challenging enough and attach a stigma to it. Its true that we have the instincts of pushing boundaries thats why our species has literally colonized the world twice. But what is ultimately most fulfilling in life isnt struggling to open a business learning Chinese or trekking through jungles and getting malaria. Its to share your life with family and friends especially a romantic partner and your children. And the best way to have this life is to have a stable job.,GetMotivated,cxu7otu,49,t5_2rmfx

Heres an explanation including a graph with the proverbial pellet dispenser Here would be my suggestions Find a different game or activity that can use up the time that goes to Runescape. Itll be hard to stick to your guns without a replacement. See if you can cut off contact to friends and other people who can get you to play the game again once you quit. Defriend change emails etc. You might need to change your digital social circle to avoid getting pulled in again Remove your own access to the game  obviously not easy for Runescape so youll have to get rid of the account Give it away sell it delete it  take your pick. It might not work the next time or after that. But thats with a lot of compulsive behaviour You need to make a few attempts before youll find one that sticks.,GetMotivated,cxxcjq6,1,t5_2rmfx

6061717,0,t3_3yk1ji,I think its similar to a muscle  you train and that also makes it something youre born with.  Some people are naturally stronger than others but muscles can be trained to become stronger.  Discipline is extremely important.  Motivation is great but it doesnt always come in a positive form and sometimes it doesnt even feel like motivation.  Feeling alone is motivation to meet somebody.  Feeling fat is motivation to diet and work out.  It doesnt feel great though.  Addressing the issue does but it takes discipline to address the issue consistently.  Motivation whether positive or negative is based on emotion and emotion subsides.  Discipline is based on behavior which with discipline can be consistent regardless of emotion or motivation. ,GetMotivated,cye6o1f,1,t5_2rmfx

As you go higher and higher up the performance ladder you can do less and less individualistic expression in poker or chess. I dont play chess anymore but when I did I was known by lowerranked teammates to have a favor for knights. But when I played fairly matched people I could not indulge in my personality or pretentious favor of knights. I had to evaluate knights as fairly as any other piece. I had to work within a smaller space of performant strategies. I had to converge.I dont know if you play Starcraft  but my message implies that one day Slayers Boxer must do more rational plays if he wishes to stay in Code S he couldnt and Marine King and Marine Lord had to stop their marine nonsense they stopped. Now they do conventional strategies occasionally throwing in a fashionable game to please the crowds.Their play converged with the other Code S pros. Are there still differences? Yes. Code S differences. But as you go higher and higher in any performance ladder for any activity the space of good strategies will shrink.The same is for poker. Sure take more risks. Sure be more conservative. But poker punishes both underrisky and overrisky. Poker rewards the optimally risky. So those who stray too far away will get chopped off. What remains is the space of expert strategy which shall be smaller than amateur space.Constraint doesnt obliterate individuality but it does chop off the rough edges. Constraint shrinks the space of winning strategies.,GetMotivated,cyrpbhc,1,t5_2rmfx

It makes an ass of me yeah but if he reads what I typed maybe itll jar him out of his selfpity long enough for my advice to ring half a note to him.that said I draw a very serious line when it comes to having your kid die no amount of get over it can convince a man to get past that.so I tell him quit whining to make him mad and say move on youre better than this to let him know that I do sympathize just not for the sake of justifying his selfpity.I dont tolerate self pity Ive been there and it was awful never wanna be caught in that mire again it pisses me off when I see people so thick with it that they cant even see their feet in front of them.,GetMotivated,cz22vcj,2,t5_2rmfx

There is absolutely a  free projects you could help with such as open source software a tech wiki on something or a quality instruction booklet for a nonexistent product. If you have software QA experience and tech writing experience shown in a portfolio really I dont think its that hard to break into.

Millions of people have also died under Zedongs political decisions. The Americans and the Australians have a long history with the indigenous people of their respective lands.

6418895,0,t1_czj6f2k,Fair point. But I think in this context fixing it is doing what you can which is moving on. The point of this motivational saying is to me to fix whats broken for you not fix the impossible. If its a relationship that has ended or is toxic fixing may mean moving on. If youve got a terrible boss and cant get any resolution at work fixing may mean getting a new job. This is about not letting circumstances dictate your success. Its about making choices to make things right for you not about fixing things out of your control. My opinion. Not sure if that helped. ,GetMotivated,czj90no,1,t5_2rmfx

This is a flash card system that creates a custom schedule of repeated exposure for each card based on your learning progress.  Its a little complicated to set up but once you have your material in there and you follow the learning intervals required you literally cannot fail.  It makes any other flash card app look really dumb.The way it works is you study each card in sets to suit your schedule.  You assign a familiarity rating to each factoid... based on that you are shown that card a certain duration later. E.g. tomorrow next week etc.Its multimedia so can handle text formatting images sound playback.  There are many public decks for free but making your own private deck of cards is recommended.,GetMotivated,czlckft,1,t5_2rmfx
6440977,0,t1_czlit55,Alright so here goes.  This is the story of two brothers born  years apart.  Both share a virtually identical upbringing.  The parents of these two stressed fairness and could never be described as anything other than loving parents.  They werent perfect parents but they did the best they could to encourage both brothers grew to their full potential.  .  Both brothers had these in common  AB student in elementary school  BC student in high school  Barely made it into college  Charming Attractive Intelligent but never worked to increase those qualities.  Both were persuasive and direct.   Both started smoking copious amounts of marijuana at some point in high school.   Both went on academic probation after their first year and were threatened with expulsion.  Both still smoke copious amounts of marijuana to this day.  .   The younger brother is currently exactly as you describe in the OP.  He is lazy and messy and the most probable explanation for him is that because his parents did everything for him he doesnt know how to take care of himself.   He claims he would like to change but can never seem to string any progress together.  The time since his last claim becomes days... then weeks.. and now years.  Hell never say it aloud and is much more likely to put it in a Reddit post but he is depressed and time is only making it worse.  It devastates him inside.  .   The older brother was the exact same as you and the younger brother.  He would wake up every morning and sit down in the shower and cry.  He would ask himself everyday should today be the day I kill myself.  He never understood why it hurt.  Nothing ever made sense.  He knew the problems and the voice in his head knew the solutions.   Im lazy... Well get the fuck up!  im fat... Well go to the fucking gym!  I dont have a girlfriend... Well go the fuck out!  .   The solutions all seemed reasonable and easy even but he could never bring himself to do it.  Once the time came he would say tomorrow and the voice wouldnt be there to argue with him and tomorrow would never come.  .  Fast forward  years later present day older brother is exactly as you claim you want to be.  He turned his grades around sqweeked out a high enough GPA to graduate and a couple years later got a job that paid for his graduate school.  He now has a masters and is an up and comer in his field.  Youd think hes a boyscout but really hes not.  He still smokes weed every day.  Plays way too many video games and doesnt think of himself as an adult yet and has horrible issues with authority.  .   So what the fuck happened?  .   Well the truth is we really dont know.  There is an event that occurred in the older brothers life that the younger brother never experienced and you will hopefully never experience but the outcome of that event may help provide guidance.   .   Shortly before the older brother was to be kicked from college he was diagnosed with cancer.  He was told hed have to leave school and prepare for the hardest years of his life.  His parents were expecting him to be distraught but he wasnt.  He looked the doctor in the eye smiled a half smile and said okay whats step ?   From that point forward he was a different person.  The person he always could have been.   .  Youre probably saying now well i dont plan on getting sick how can this help me?   Maybe it can and maybe it cant.   .  What I can tell you is the changes that the older brother to himself that the younger brother refuses or is unable to make.   .   First he stopped caring about what other people thought and he started caring about only what he thought.  This is difficult for everyone.  Its so much easier said that done and it can feel really lonely at times.   He didnt care what people said.  He used all of his experiences so far in life to decide what was a good thing and a bad thing and started caring what he thought about himself.  He kept thinking if i died today right now what would people say.  Well nothing good to be perfectly honest.  He was close to being a drop out and generally didnt do anything for anybody. Why would anybody care about him?   This turned into.  Well if nobody else is going to care about me then at least I should..   He started pushing away the people that were toxic in his life.  The friends he had that werent really friends.  The girlfriend that was afraid to see him succeed and leave her.  It was tough but it needed to happen.   .   Second he realized he didnt have a hobby... He had things he did when he was bored but never brought those things to the next level.  He tried picking up guitar books and anybody elses hobby but after a few days he lost interest.  He decided to take a new strategy and again reevaluate himself.  What does he actually LIKE to do?  Well he spends hours after work playing video games.  Okay can this actually be a hobby?  For most people no.  But then again for most people knitting is a stupid as hell hobby too.  So he started taking his gaming to the next level.  First he figured he could be good enough to be the best gamer but that wasnt happening.  Some kids are really really good.   .  Well what about a streamer? Streamers just really use their personality and handle all the technical work on their own.  So the older brother learned some basic code and how to use OBS and now has a stream that rivals those of the best streamers out there by looks anyway.  This was effectively creating a hobby out of a time waster and gave him something to be proud of.   From there his mood changed.  He still smokes his weed and hangs out with his friends but hes now more of piece of the group rather than someone in the background..   The older brother needed a kick in the ass to realize his potential.  His was being told he has a chance of dying.  He didnt want to die doing nothing with his life.  Mortality scared him to greatness even if he never showed it.   .   Neither brother was an outcast or anti social.  They both made bad choices when it came to their crew and over time the issues grew and grew.  The older brother needed a wake up call to take a step back and see those issues the younger brother is still in denial.   .   The moral is... I dont know.  Life is hard and when you dont have a good support system its even harder.  Nobody has all the answers and everybody is faking it.  Youre never going to feel like you have it all figured out.  Theres only one person in the world you can ever impact and that is yourself.  Believe it or not you legitimately can be and probably have the entire package of skills needed to do whatever you want.  You can either look at your life now take the good and expand on it to the point where the flaws start to disappear or you can keep with the status quo.   You need to take pride in something.  Something you were doing anyway.  Just look at that thing and make it better.  Then look at it the next day and make it better.   You say you want goals and inspiration just make sure theyre yours.  If you try and take mine or anyone elses youll fail.  Lets say you love making hot pockets.  Well everytime you make another hotpocket do something to it.  Add some olive oil to the top.  Fry it.  Who the fuck knows.  Just do whatever you can to make the perfect hotpocket.   Everyday keep trying to improve on it.   .  Start small.  You are in the same funk that both brothers were in.  Its not the end of the world and youve proven that by showing you know how to evaluate yourself.  Take your time everyone grows up at their own pace.  I know this story doesnt perfectly relate but I know there are some pieces you can use.  .  Dont give up.  Some of the best people in the world have no idea what theyre capable of...   ... yet.,GetMotivated,czljazw,7,t5_2rmfx

6478810,0,t1_czpfyki,Great freaking question.  Im not entirely sure...College I didnt know what I was doing when I was younger... I just did it because thats what you were suppose to do. My Dad wanted me to go to college because he didnt.  There were some key moments I remember in the Junior College where I realized if I didnt step the F up I was going to be stuck where I was in life forever.  I didnt want to be there.  I wanted to have money to do things.  Not ever to be homeless again my mom gambled away our  months of our rent money.  So my motivation didnt kick in until that moment when I realized that what I was doing was to move up in the world.EngineeringCareer I did some research for jobs that I thought were interesting and paid decently.  I tried to pursue those because I knew in the end it would pay off.  I thought Electrical Engineering wouldve been awesome... after some research nope not for me.  Civil has been so far the best.  I enjoy seeing buildings roads etc. being built and being part of a team.  Its pretty sweet.  The motivation to find the job came from wanting to provide for myself and my family.  Not have anyone ever be hungry or homeless.  Ive been pretty damn conservative with financial choices.  So far theyve paid off.FamilyKids I like being around good people... they make me happy.  My wife is a good person.  Im extremely lucky to have met her.  Found her online a couple states away when internet chat rooms were first on the internet.  Did the long distance relationship for  years and got married!  She moved to me.  State was too expensive so we moved back to her state.  Got the house for the kids... and we just popped one out a couple months ago.  Adorable.  Kids are freaking awesome.  Who doesnt love Disneyland!?  Thats actually the goal for the kids in the near future.  There are definitely goals for them.  I find thats what Im working towards now is just being a good Dad and providing them with opportunities I had and maybe more.  Motivation for familykids Disneyland!  That place is awesome!

6663612,0,t3_46vpff,This isnt a bad situation. This is a great opportunity. Try to see the forest through the trees.Worst case scenario You were unable to fix a broken store.Best case scenario You prove yourself.Either way youre getting paid and earning real life experience. The stress is coming from having a lot to do and not feeling like youre making headway anywhere. The key here is to break it down into smaller manageable tasks and focus on one thing at a time. Thieves are stealing food. Guest satisfaction is awful. Drive thru times are bad. Your staff arent very motivated or competent. The store is unstocked. The store is filthy. Morale is low.So instead of jumping from one problem to another as they arise pick one and focus on it. Get that one sorted out and keep it sorted. Once that feels manageable move on to another one. I think the best place to start is probably employee morale.

6687424,0,t1_d0b0aa1,Well I got some one on one training for a few hours with a big expert player and paid for a subscription service to another expert who would evaluate his recorded games then email subscribers a few pages of him explaining why he did things in that game etc.  But what it often came down to can be explained by that expert that i paid to learn from.  He made a few practice scenarios you would load the game and he had created custom battles for people to practice with.  What it was really was an impossible fight that you could not win without micromanaging your units.  So you had to figure out how do I get my  guys to beat the  guys that this expert had set out for me?  Then after I tried it many times the expert said how HE beat it.  And what he laid out was just physically impossible for me to do.  Basically he suggested segmenting the units into groups of  which meant drawing a box on the screen around  units then hitting cntrl  then another  hitting cntrl  etc.  This would put the units into  different groups you could then click your number  key and itwould auto select those first  units. The thing is as soon as the tutorial started the units were moving towards yours you had just a couple seconds to do all this THEN keep track of  groups of units and micro them.  No matter what I did I just could NOT get all that done before the enemy units were attacking mine. The crazy thing is... this expert had said many times that he was only able to keep up with other experts using good strategy and smarts he was very slow compared to the top players.   And I was slow compared to him even when i played every day and was at the top of my game.  Kind of a long explanation sorry but it really just showed me at that time that i was really never going to be a top player.  Maybe it was my age i was in my early s.  In my early teens I had won Street Fighter   and Mortal Kombat tourneys locally where I live was always at the top of a match playing Quake  or Doom etc.  So locally when i was young i was the guy to beat I would often go to an arcade and never lose a SF match in a whole day of playing.  So its not like im a shitty player its just that the top players are THAT good IMO.  One time I got to play a top AOM expert who was sponsored by Intel... it was a joke.  Really it was a level i could never hope to get to.  ,GetMotivated,d0b1dox,1,t5_2rmfx

Particularly among the bar crowd but absolutely extending much further beyond and close knit family ties are only a portion of it.What is it exactly that negates any experiences a  year old has? The years before are our formative years when we are to realize that childhood is not lasting. We are usually in our most vulnerable state then and we learn a lot of lifes hard lessons then some more so than others. The  year old OP in question made an honest and true statement. What was false about it? Heshe even had the maturity to acknowledge that their age may prevent them from knowing if its true depression or simply part of growing up. And who the hell compiles data just for shits and giggles on the comparison of age demographics and their views on how life works?

6746660,0,t3_483vnj,Hey I was in a really similar situation. What really helped me was scheduling.If you already spent the day working chances are you used up a lot of your willpower. Scheduling your chores and using other habit building techniques can reduce the amount of willpower you need to actually follow through on them.As one example I used chaining to make sure I got basic chores done. This is based on the idea that habits are triggered or cued by other actions e.g. toothbrushing is cued by it being morning and you being in the bathroom. So as soon as I got home from the gym I had a specific unchanging routine to follow . Shoes come off. Jacket gets hung up. Laundry goes in the wash. Dishes in the sink get cleaned. Dinner goes on the stove if I have leftoversI was often pretty tired when I got home but keeping my momentum going through the steps let me get all of it done before I entered vegetable mode.

Your school likely offers free counseling and free tutoring. Go to both at least once. You find its not right for you? See if theres a different counselor or tutor you can try. If you hate it after  times maybe it isnt for you. But chances are these services will reduce your anxiety and allow you to be more productive instead of wasting all your time and energy on being depressedanxiousupset about how your life feels like its flying apart. Or maybe you havent gotten that far yet maybe things arent that bad. But its taken me  years to get to the point where I can petition that academic dismissal so I can even ATTEMPT to get back into a  year university. My GPA is shit I wasted thousands upon thousands of dollars Im rotting away in a community college living at home wondering who the fuck decided being in your twenties was fun and exciting. Im watching my life flash by years running out before me as I struggle just to keep from drowning. My friends have all graduated and are getting real jobs but Ive still got nearly  years to go once I get into a transfer school. They have relationships I live with my parents and selfisolate because Im STILL ashamed of how badly I flamed out  because I thought I was going places I thought I was smart I thought I had worked so hard and given up so much of my youth that I was guaranteed success. I wasnt guaranteed shit. I wasted a golden opportunity so much money and now Im back behind where I was at age  in terms of my options. I might have well have fucked off and had fun all of high school taken art class and yoga instead of AP chem and calf I could have had it easy and I would still be further along and better off financially than I am now. Dont fuck up your life like I did. Like Im still doing if Im honest. People say that once you hit rock bottom the only place you can go is up  but they fail to realize how fucking hard it is to get back on track once youve fallen off. I am having to work double time and Im still not back to where I was  years ago. I will never truly be able to put that failure behind me to recoup the money or time I lost. The sanity selfesteem and confidence I lost. Just please for the love of whatever you hold dearest dont do what I did. Dont wait until its so bad it cant be fixed.

Ive got the packed backpack because I live in a place with earthquakes I work out because I want to be able to hoist my own bodyweight out of danger etc I know how to make shelters and so on. Not because I expect to need that stuff. Im a incidentally born into pretty straightened circumstances upperclass white girl I dont need to know how to throw someone twice my size or make a fire.But circumstances change sometimes rapidly and one of my biggest fears is that I will be unable to mitigate the bad circumstances the way Ive been able to take advantage of the good circumstances.However if I got hit by a bus tomorrow I wouldnt be like Oh man I really failed to react there.

One will view the other as standing too far the other as standing to close. Some people have more inate talent than others at learning body language.

7092578,0,t3_4co05a,Life is a monotonous deal. Usually when we are the happiest it is when there is a break in the flow when there is something new exciting and that drive to discover kicks in. If you find that you are stuck. That the energy to do is gone. The only way to break it is to force yourself and when you do make sure you force yourself in the process to appreciate things. Takes  days to make a new habit. So pick something new to learndo and stick to it for  days. It can be as easy as going for a walk every day after dinner or as hard as learning to dance. You can also just start learning new skills. I currently am i licensed hunter scuba diver sailor first aider swimming coach lindy hop teacher plus a few others which have nothing to do with my Job as a engineer. Every year i pick something new every year i meet new people learn new things and i have never regretted it. I know that when i am complacent i get depressed i loose interest in the small hobbies i stop exercising i stop going out. So i make sure that  or  times a week i have a real commitment. A class a course a social event. It keeps you alive and active. Also if you dont like your apartment fix it. Decide to commit to a change. Paint all the walls change the kitchen buy a new couch donate the things you dont like. You drive your own life. Every day is a day of your own choosing. Sometimes that seems like a overwhelming thought. But it also means that there is no reason you cant make tomorrow different.,GetMotivated,d1kb9ek,1,t5_2rmfx

Rafiki puts it best Change is good. Make a pros and cons list for what the different steps might contain. Find the one with the most pros and least cons. Then analyze if you would still care in a year from now about taking that step. If the feels arent the same might not be for you. Be aware that change can be how others want it unless you speak for yourself. Mistakes are how humans have learned so dont be afraid to make a few. Believe in change and view change as good.

7287704,0,t1_d26jsdf,You are just like me. I procrastinate forever. Im always telling myself just  more game then Ill do my work. I see a reoccurring theme in a lot of these posts which is making a schedule full of things you want to do and do them everyday. Then after Im done with EVERYTHING I can have my gaming time. Then slowly lower that gaming time. ,GetMotivated,d26ka2n,2,t5_2rmfx
7288369,0,t3_4f7hca,I have been working on stopping gaming too I think the best things for me so far . plan out your day with no video games involved if you are a organized person this works very well and often I find that I default to video games when I have nothing to do so schedule your free time with other fun things or even get rid of it. Get rid of one game once you throw awaydelete one game not your favorite one but a minor one it helps you to realize how useless and pointless the time you spent playing it was now that you can never usebenefit from it again. I did this with a cancer game clash of clans and I realized that games in general are useless immaterial and erasable.. power off practice. This is when you join a game hearthstone cod lol etc. and mid game turn it off. This helped the most because it helps build willpower to resist playing games and helps in the process of putting down the games for good. This also forces you to think through how pointless the games are before you shit them off and was most useful for me. . not applicable to most games if there is a table topphysical way to play the video game play that instead.. go cold turkey and throw out games cancel subscriptions delete save files break CDs shut off internet if neccesary it sucks but it will work. read run build something play instruments write cook lift hike camp fish star gaze play the didgeridoo whatever it is it will help and is almost guarenteed to be more productive and beneficial than gaming.Good luck to all of you working to get rid of gaming addiction me included,GetMotivated,d26n005,0,t5_2rmfx

Ive been dealing with a similar struggle and the giving myself a kick in the ass approach has worked for me so I guess thats where it came from.  That said I have to stand by it based on what has worked for me.  Ive recently gotten myself off of a shitty path that led to some serious consequences and left me with nothing.  I still have a pretty barebones life with no real friends much less a relationship but Im happier than I ever thought I could be.  It came down to just deciding to be happy which obviously is much more of a process than just saying it hence my first comment coming off so dickish.  Ill spare you all the little epiphanies Ive had along the way but I will say meditation was a gamechanger for me.

7723148,0,t1_d3jkyvd,What nobody tells you is that no matter if you have someone you are always alone anyway. We are all alone. Even us married folks with families  after a few years it is just you in your own mind with your own thoughts.Only you understand you. And sometimes even you dont understand yourself.We are all walking alone. We will all die alone. Even if you are surrounded by people who love you  it is YOU who is dying. And that is a singularly personal experience and no one can accompany you.Even when you are doing things with someone you love  you are alone in the experience. People who do not realize this  expect being with someone to help them be happy  are looking for happiness in a place where it cannot be found. It cannot be found in the embodiment of another person. It can only be found in our own mind. If you feel any different alone than you do in a relationship  then you have still not found peace and happiness. Once you find it you realize that other people can neither add to or take away from your happiness. Victor Frankl learned this in the Nazi camps. His book Mans Search for Meaning is a testament. No one else can add to or take away from your happiness or enjoyment of life. Joy and suffering are not found in the world  they are found in the mind. Here I sit  I love my wife  I love my child  and yet I am alone. And in my loneliness I am content. Because alone is all we will ever be. ,GetMotivated,d3k2hok,8,t5_2rmfx

That first paragraph put words to what Ive been thinking for my life so fargt The real price of being so analytical is that you see social constructs and situations as the incredibly complex series of interactions that they actually are rather than the globs of simple processes most people see them as it can be very overwhelming seeing all the components and not quite knowing how they fit together.Ive been called kind empathetic any number of things when it feels like all Im really doing is understanding everyones points of view. And just like you said its overwhelming. Theres all these individual people all with their own stories and lives and ways they interact with others and while I can see that I have no idea how to move beyond it. I dont see the next step so to speak. I just graduated high school and while I have a semblance of an for the next year I have no idea what the overall plan even is.So just like you I wish hed have continued because I dont get it any of it.

Plus he gets lifetime healthcare and will be making  of his salary as a pension for the rest of his life and can retire between  assuming he started that job out of high school or college.Plus he as a gov worker has a legally vested interest in his job so if he were to ever lose it on questionable grounds he can sue the statecity and likely win because he was hired through some form of civil service exam.We need more blue collar workers  not more stupid foolish parents who think a  law degree is worth pursuing with no real reasonable way to pay it back.Source  HR Professional gt,GetMotivated,d3uuyy5,3,t5_2rmfx

If we didnt have it how would we as a species avoid doing the same thing over and over again? How could we even do the most basic task in decision making judging a good result from a bad one? We couldnt because we would have no way to compare.History is not only useful its very important.

In the end any job requires more work than just becoming good at your job.I think I partly read your original comment as treating meeting opportunity as a matter of luck i.e. you were saying that not everyone who works hard is lucky enough for the work to pay off but it sounds like what youre really saying is that you have to work on the right skills too not just work hard to become good at one thing.

Extroverts tend to be fatigued by being alone and recharge by being in social situations.Its not a disability. Being introverted doesnt preclude someone from being doing certain jobs having friendships or being happy. The only difficultly Ive had with being introverted is that it can create friction with friends who are extroverted. Our motivations for hanging out are different and my extroverted friends dont always get that I need to be alone sometimes and its not personal when I dont want to hang out or end a get together earlier than they would. ,GetMotivated,d45heu8,18,t5_2rmfx

So yea a couple of FB messages went out today. No phone calls will be made. Since FB saves your message history I quickly realized that our FB conversation between dad and me has been limited to Happy Fathers Day for the last  years. Im not sorry. This year was different than the past  on Friday we got the news that our  yr old dog is terminally ill with cancer. Thats like finding out that one of your children is going to die soon. Fellow pet lovers will understandagree. So with a heavy heart I awoke today with my two human children and one very immobile canine child. Not how I would have written the script but were making it! Great Fathers Day sermon in church and a great meal in town. Making a conscious choice to make the best of it all. Maybe Ill even get laid tonight.Edit  I most definitely did not get laid that night.

Once I arrived at the hospital I was given Morphine to help with the initial pain. Then Oxycodone during Physical Therapy. Then again Hydrocodone when I had returned home. I was hooked dependent on those prescription medications without even knowing it. It wasnt until I woke up soaking wet and feeling as if I had the Flu did I realize I was going through withdrawals from those medications.  After bouts of feeling comotosed on medications while not providing the pain relief I imagined it would and being dependent on prescription pain pills I Google searched regarding varying alternative pain management treatments and found something of substantial usefulness. That single Google search literally saved my life. In every sense of the word. If it wasnt for that accident or my many hardships I would have never attempted to take the substantial risk of opening my own business. So I thank the God the Light the Source whatever for those deadendjobs. For me falling   ft. onto concrete. For my depression anxiety and lack of courage...and for those needed steps of suffering that make up everything that I now am. Moral of the story  Life is exactly what you make of it. Life is all about your individual attitude and perspective. Life should be about your passions. Life is living inside of the moment as often as possible. Life is very very very fragile and short. What you would looovvveee to do simply needs to be altered into your mind attitude and perspective asWhat you HAVE to do.,GetMotivated,d4r91gy,1,t5_2rmfx

These are some of the rules that I live beAbove all be useful this could mean competent timely proactive or more likely a combination of the three.Dont take failure personally.Understand and accept that some people have power over you bosses clients etc and understand that this means you should do your damnedest to try and make them happy.However I disagree with his thinlyveiled implication that we should all abandon our ideals in pursuit of these goals.   He doesnt talk enough about the point where you should stick to your ideals.   People daring to make what they felt was a good thing rather than what at the time was understood to be a popular thing is the only way weve experienced innovation in this world.      Ditto for disagreeing with management.   His assertion that bosses etc are a class of people who are genuinely good folks is particularly weak.  One cannot say that self interest is NOT the primary motivator for managers in the same article that says that the way to succeed is to compete and be self interested.   Are not managers an example of success within a certain industry?  Therefore they must also be extremely self interested and should not be trusted.,GetMotivated,d4sv981,1,t5_2rmfx

Maybe youll feel more like working later now that youve had an initial crack at it.Podmoro Technique This is so simple but so amazing discovered this during the most recent exam period and I find once you get into it you can just work all day. All you do is work your ass of  mins take  min break get up stretch snack meditate dont think about work. Repeat this then after  hours has passed you take a  or  minute break. I take an hour for lunch. I know it sounds like a lot of time spent on breaks but using this I can work  hour days with no drop off in productivity. Whereas before I used to work about  hours straight get tired take  hours off then do like an hour work at night it wasnt productive or healthy.Diet eat your veg eat good healthy meals its good for your energy levels and your brain needs vitamins and minerals to operate at peak efficiency. You can still eat junk food I personally do but if you just make the effort to cut down it gets easier ive pretty much cut out chocolate takeaways readymeals crisps Cookies just by gradually phasing them out over  years. I will say that whenever I tried to make a drastic change and just start eating super healthy with no junk Id always swing back and binge after a few days.Ask why  youve got to ask yourself why you want to be doing this. Personally Uni is for money and I want to be able to buy nice stuff for my family plus a hottub in my bedroom like scarface. Gym is to keep my girlfriend happy.

8315660,0,t1_d5gy9ok,gt Does under thinking really have a higher success rate? Is dumb luck so prevalent that people avoid unnecessary planning?It isnt luck.  People avoid doing things because you can never know  what is going to happen as you do not have perfect information.  You need to accept that and just do things.  Or you still do things but waste time preparing for eventualities that arent going to happen.  This prevents you from doing other things.To be good at stuff you simply have to do it long enough the  hour rule.  The more you are doing different things the better you are becoming.

8459370,0,t3_4vfiju,Ive been wanting to write down these ideas for awhile in the hopes that someone else might find them useful. I know this sub has a tendency toward contrarianism and I certainly do not intend these ideas to be universal  but just wanted to present these things that have personally worked for me and can maybe benefit someone else. If I slip into direct address and say you  Im really just referring to myself. Long story short  about two years ago I hated where I was in life. It was the recognition of these three ideas that kept me going and helped me to turn my life around. I should add that these ideas arent original but things that Ive come across during that time and paraphrased one way or another. . The human being is meant to bear the burden of  hours  no more no less. If you live in the future you will get anxious if you live in the past you will get depressed. Twenty four hours is all that you have to live in. Give up all the other burdens to the universe to god to your cat to whatever  but the burdens of the past are not yours. The burdens of the future arent yours either. Let them go. The day is your material. Its whats in front of you its the only thing that you have the power to change or to shape or to use. Its your canvas. Its your material. So use it well. . Happiness is not something you can pursue  but instead the byproduct of doing the right thing. We get so tripped up thinking that happiness is an end goal  and then get frustrated when it slips through our fingers. Instead focus on whatever the right thing is  and happiness will follow. Feel like shit at the end of the day? Maybe its because you ate a tub of ice cream for dinner forgot to call your mom back blew off homework to play video games etc. On the surface those are all things that should make you happy  but Ive found that when Im feeling most depressed its usually a factor of actions I either did or more likely did not do. If youre passively waiting for happiness to wash over you like a wave  its not going to happen. Instead take action do whatever the right thing is and that feeling of warmth and fulfillment will follow of its own accord. . The worlds idea of success is total shit. Dont get sucked into it. On television on the street when talking with friends or family  it seems like everyone confuses the concept of rewards with success itself. Whether its money fame recognition praise sex the rewards are not up to you  they are all dependent on someone else. Instead think of success as sustained effort of will. It begins and ends with YOU and no one else. Think of any fantasy or goal you may have  say youve always wanted to be a great artist. Imagine it. What does that look like? I guarantee youre thinking about palling around in paris with beautiful women and having your art work admired in galleries and being given the nobel prize  basically youre fantasizing about having been a great artist and not actually making the art. That way of thinking can totally mess you up because it once again puts the emphasis on passive recognition over active sustained effort. The more you shift focus onto your own actions the more you create sustained effort and the more likely it is that the rewards will follow.Lastly as a bit of an addendum  its good to remember the difference between stopping and quitting. This helps me when Im feeling a bit lost or down on myself  or during those times when Ive just chucked these three ideas to the wind and sat on the couch all day instead. If youve ever strayed from what you feel you were supposed to do or who you were supposed to be  remember that everyone has to stop. Whatever it is were doing whatever our grand ambitions are in life we stop. We have to stop. We have to take a piss or go to bed or go on vacation or we have a kid and not have much time to ourselves etc. But quitting is stopping without ever beginning again. So as long as youre here as long as youre alive and pulling air through your lungs you can begin again. And if you begin again then you havent quit. So fucking begin again. Hope this helps someone out there. ,GetMotivated,d5yyfhq,1,t5_2rmfx

8472216,0,t1_d608wqb,Its definitely very unBuddhist though Id question whether being Buddhist is itself an end. But speaking more towards personal happiness and mindset desire and motivation go hand in hand. I maintain both happiness and motivation when my expectations are low and my desire is high. However I am always teetering on the balance of keeping expectations down because my default is to feel high expectations and commit  of my energy into reaching them.The curse of ambition to me is the constant fight to keep expectations reasonable. Ambition lets me summon motivation when I need to but the flipside is a perpetual internal struggle over expectations.

Its cathartic to become physically or verbally abusive in retaliation but how do you feel when you say or do nothing? When you stop yourself from sinking to the level of your aggressor? It sucks! Its far tougher to walk away than it is to retaliate in any fashion. Thats why Ive always found it ironic that people perceive toughness as being an aggressor or physically imposing.

It took me a long time until I finally realized that my habits had been distracting me from the inevitable and it was only going to get harder every time to finally just surrender. I was involuntarily committed to a hospital and my phone was taken away on the first day. I felt like they had tore a part of my soul out and I was so terrified at first.

I still smoke more than I should and sleepin quite a bit but I decided that if I couldnt stop those things immediately Id take other things on board to make sure that I had other passions. So I gym it every day now play football I read again write music make youtube videos. Its all little stuff but its little stuff Im passionate about and work at then if I have an evening of smoking its like a reward Im not as guilty.

When hippomom got home from work she asked whats wrong and hippo said the lions were being mean to him. Hippomom remembering how painful the adolescent years can be sighed heavily not everyone will love your gapped smile your witty sense of humor or that curly little tail of yours! Some animals are just that animals. They stick to their pack and cant handle seeing a single hippo fat and happy such as yourself enjoying the sun without trying to ruin their day. You must distance yourself from these types. They only want to harm you because their happiness isnt real. Their happiness depends on their friends and putting others down. She smiles and gives him a playful bump with her rump. Hey let me see that smile! Lemmie see... There it is! Now look theres some fisherman in a boat coming over to have a look why dont you go give them a playful splash and see if they will play with you! As he floats towards the boat hippomom sheds a tear knowing she cant protect him forever. As she has herself he will be mocked all his life. He will be looked over as an uninteresting fat... Water cow. How she hated that term. Hippomom turns to the lions standing near the shore panting and speaks to no one but herself you will pay. ,GetMotivated,d7fvbem,173,t5_2rmfx

He didnt express that he was antiSemite.Take his statement and replace it with any other nationality ethnicity cultural subgroup and it still makes sense. Its not a condoning of prejudice but an acknowledgement of one of the excuses for prejudice.There is a trait in the Irish character...There is a trait in the American character...There is a trait in the Filipino character ... There is a trait in the Mormon character ... There is a trait in the Baptist character ... There is a trait in the Atheist character ... We can all fill in the rest of those statements. He is simply acknowledging this facet of the human condition.An acknowledgement of what differences whether falsely perceived or totally real are used as the basis for prejudice is simply an choice to exist in reality. The choice to ignore these differences or forgive the frustration that they might create in conflict with our own idiosyncratic behavior is tolerance.From other comments below regarding Dahls close association with other Jewish persons it sounds like he was rather tolerant.,GetMotivated,d7vy1co,29,t5_2rmfx

The boy takes the quarters and leaves.What did I tell you? said the barber. That kid never learns!Later when the customer leaves he sees the same young boy coming out of the ice cream store.Hey son!

Unfortunately being British you may not fathom the idea that people across the US are taught a different science curriculum based on where they live. Some of these places in the south still teach creationism alongside evolution. The goal of the show is to inspire young Americans to pick up scientific critical thinking and run with it. The entire first episode sets that tone. We dont have the luxury of being able to present actual science here with a David Attenborough narrative. That wont fly here.

9568062,0,t1_d9ra920,This was at my job too.  I have done more research on it and thought it was odd that a few words and phrases could be responsible for changing a mindset.  I could see how telling a student good effort versus good work would have a difference on how students would feel valued but felt there had to be more.  Growth Mindset is more than just a few seminars andor one presentation and emails sent out.  It should include actionsactivities where you experience your mind doing something beyond what you thought and going through this for about a year.  Once youve experienced it and truly understand how to share and build the foundation of a growth mindset in yourself then you can help others.  At my job it was used as a slogan or a way of pointing out the dissenting or negative views or both of those who were not part of administration.  Maybe you should have a growth mindset about it and try  or something similar was a familiar phrase thrown at anyone who didnt agree.  It was being used as the positive mindset of a few years ago that was essentially bullying and threatening people to do things they didnt agree with and to go along with the status quo.  Which really isnt what a positive outlook or a growth mindset is supposed to be.  They are not just slogans or words to motivate but are part of a process to be experienced and cultivated before there can be a real change in how you think and perceive the world and challenges you face.  People are looking for the quick fixes and want things to be handed to them in something like a five minute tip on how to improve your day.  It may improve a little but you will not have the results you are truly looking for without time and effort.  I was told to have a growth mindset about what I thought I could accomplish when I suggested we truly understand and take the time to setup a new program by starting from the bottom and slowly implementing instead of jumping right in the program.  That even if I fail I learn from the failure and I shouldnt be afraid to fail.  I explained that I wasnt afraid of failure I saw it could still be a failure taking the time to understand and go through.  But that is what is missing from the positive outlook and the growth mindset I have seen in action outside of studies is the time effort and mindfulness of actually attempting to do well and strive for success.  Not perfection on the first try mind you but success in a larger goal overall complete with the failures along the way.  This is not what employers want from my experience.  They want a quick fix.  Words alone do not change work habits.  Actions do.  ,GetMotivated,d9sgjdy,1,t5_2rmfx

Hes made the mistakes so I can learn what not to do. And very simply put hes the best of the best and hes my model.I have other models too but Jordan is the main person I model.Grant Cardone is my  wealth building mentor for investing in Real Estate and building wealth. Some sales stuff too but his sales training is mostly garbage compared to Jordans. So mostly wealth creation and hard work.Eric Thomas is my  model for motivation and hard work and uncovering what true success means faith in God and having a great relationship with your spouse.T.D. Jakes is my  faith model because hes just unlike any other preacher out there. His in depth knowledge of The Bible helps me incredibly to understand it and apply it in my life.And Jesus Christ is my  life model because He shows us what true life is all about and what you need to do to have the most fulfilling life possible and how to do anything in life.I didnt really choose my models they just kind of floated into my life and I find myself mostly influenced by them and desiring to learn more to be like them.Hope that helpsS,GetMotivated,damcp1p,1,t5_2rmfx

9865136,0,t1_dat9wex,Come by rstopsmoking . I quit over a year ago in July last year.   Biggest tip I can give you Interrupt your habits or take advantage of interrupted habits. When I quit I was moving out of the house I shared with my friends had just gotten a new car and the campus I work on had recently gone full no smoking and I was going on a month long work trip. That killed pretty much every smoking situation I had. No more friends to walk out to on the back porch to light up with new car to not get smelly work became a no go and then I left all that anyway and was working in clean room conditions for a month so I couldnt smoke anyway.   Not saying that you need to move buy a new car hire people to harass you when you try to smoke and go on a long trip to quit but take advantage of changing habits and dont reconnect the new ones with smoking. Breaking that autopilot I smoke here normally so Im going to smoke now reaction is very important.  ,GetMotivated,datg7f5,8,t5_2rmfx

After being thru everything i wouldnt give it up but i would of liked to do more when i was young but just get married and have kids also which is only possible if you have a partner whos fully on board to working together to do great its not in most peoples nature to do so.  I feel the exception in my personal case i did exactly what i set to do given my constraints like everyone we have constructed artificial constraints based on a lot of issues.  You cant tell a teenager not to do something or to do its futile in most cases thats why average college and vocational graduate at roughly  percent because many get into the fun excited feeling of doing what is not normal in the conventionally led. I knew at  what i wanted and by  i was on the fast track to being the typical  to five dad with a stay home wife taking on the homemaker and children raising roll.  Which was amazing being a  year old dad with money meeting  year old with money and at similar levels just starting with kids after doing me for  years.  I may be one of the  percent or less doing what my grandparents did but most didnt believe in so caused disfunction and backlash of the free love free living culture and hard wired to be monogamous and a provider no matter what.

Eventually the right woman found me  shes not perfect but shes way the fuck out of my league lookswise and weve been together for  years.The difference in your situation is that a skill like pool is just you against an inanimate object.So much of dating or romance or whatever has to do with the other person. When we meet someone and it doesnt work we often blame ourselves and the effect of the letdowns is cumulative on your psyche. It shouldnt be though because each new person is like a totally different universe. You can get ground down and feel like nobody wants you but I truly believe that there is someone for everyone. What you have to do is realize that with every new person its really the first time  your previous failures mean nothing....youre trying for a fit try not to get too invested right off the bat.

10141607,0,t1_dbt2zxp,Agreed.  After my mother died nearly all of my close friends abandoned me but would often appear to tell me to stop being so selfish and to count my blessings and understand that yes yes its so difficult watching your abusive mother die after having to look after her through her last year and losing all your life savings because you inherited her legal fuckups and you almost lost your apartment because she comitted benefit fraud in your name but there are real problems in the world like.... having your boyfriend cheat on you!  I eventually fell out with my friends because I got fed up of the way they kept letting me down over and over when I needed them the most and then demanding that I acknolwedge all they had done for me and to support them through their anguish over relationship breakups and disappointing tinder dates.   They just dont get what its like to grow up in an abusive home or to grow up poor and when I point that out to them they fly into a rage and tell me that Im being bitter and need to understand they have it just as hard.    Right now I went out on a date with a really hot guy... it went so well and then went sour so now I feel even shittier with a major case of blue balls guy was doing the whole open relationship thing and then felt guilty about it and now Im sitting here wondering why nothing in my life ever goes right now matter how much effort or not I put in i always get the same results.   I just really cant stand people anymore and always seem to make everyone hate me from my family to my friends to anyone I go out on dates with so I think Im not going to go outside anymore.   I really wish I could be normal and get to go to parties and go on dates but I think I have to accept Im meant to be alone and should put the void left by my former social life to good use though I need to figure out how to do it so other people are not involved.   I hate being alone but other people just dont like me.    When Im quiet people say Im boring.  When I talk people say Im annoying and tell me to shut up again.  I just hope one day I find people who will love me for who I am and dont make me feel ashamed to be myself every time I open my mouth. ,GetMotivated,dbtgf2t,2,t5_2rmfx

Before anything else make a list of things that are going well why theyre going well and how youll continue to prioritize them. So then  Make an incremental change. Set your alarm  minutes earlier and get up stretch and prepare a healthy breakfast. Make small changes and dont expect results overnight.  Clean one small area a day. A shelf. A cupboard. Nothing big. Then cultivate a habit of doing the floors etc.fairly regularly.  Go on a date and talk about your concerns. Communication is everything. My wife and I renew this ritual every six months or so and it always makes us feel better about our relationship especially when its hard.  Video games are great for blowing off steam and its healthy to have hobbies. Can you put on a timer and limit your gaming to  minutes a day? Very best of luck to you.

And I suspect that rather often success is a short lived source of happiness  at least that has been my experience. Id like to add what I like to call the air mask principle On airplanes you are adviced to put on your own mask first in case of an emergency. Ambulance workers are required to ensure their own safety before that of their patients. The same principle goes for every day life When having to choose between the well being of others and that of your own choose the latter unapologetically every time. If you are miserable it is unlikely that you will be a resource to those around you. Only by being content can you hope to make a positive difference.,GetMotivated,dcj7vsx,1,t5_2rmfx

10507840,0,t1_dcz3wtn,I have been there and it is really tough! Only recently I have seen the light at the end of the tunnel. Over the years I have learnt not to define myself by just my thoughts and feelings. Although I still have these thoughts sometimes I see them as just thoughts from me in the past and they no longer have the power they once did. I did this by being aware of my thoughts and not judging them or myself so harshly. It took a long while and was definitely  steps forward and  steps back. I found meditation helped me to calmly watch my thoughts and feelings. I am now just beginning to enjoy life again and learning to love myself and others too. Life is better now and more sincere. I also have more compassion for others and more patience too. I would not have this without my suffering. Hang in there try to be calm and things will eventually get better than you can currently imagine. ,GetMotivated,dcz6b0w,4,t5_2rmfx

10637674,0,t3_5s4kb2,Its been said before but starting business with your friends is very difficult on the business and especially your relationship. Its like working with your parents or siblings you see them as coworkers and no longer in the light of how you used to see them. Its especially true for friends that are already the type to party like your friend does. Not that its inherently bad but did you really expect for him to change his habits just for the sake of the business in the starting up process? People dont change quickly and the more you do for him the less he expects to have to do. I say have a serious sit down with him put up real numbers on expenses and time invested so far. If he still doesnt see the issues hes causing he probably never will. Put yourself  owner legally and let him know that that is your plan moving forward. He can be mad all he wants but he will have no recourse. It sucks but if he cant be a coworker and he cant be your friend then why are you keeping him around?,GetMotivated,ddd70ip,1,t5_2rmfx

10650221,0,t3_5sejif,Oh man. I wanna help you dude but idk how much I can. But here goes.Im in a similar situation as you. I have no motivation to do anything even things I care about. What Ive found is that motivation never just appears on its own. I have to really push myself to go out and do stuff. But when I do its almost always worth it. Its much easier to do stuff with other people than by yourself. So find some people who are doing something youre interested in and go to their next meeting. The Meetup app is fantastic for this. You can also find out about local groups by going to coffeeshops and other community spaces and reading their bulletin boards. When you find something that piques your interest make yourself go. Whatever you have to do to make that happen. Try to foster a sense of anticipation and excitement about it. I know that sounds lame but if you find something that you are interested in you should be able to get at least a little excited about it so nurture that feeling. Then go. Keep an open mind. Listen to people. Ask What can I do? How can I help? Whats a good way to get started? Whens the next meeting? If you like whatever the activity is tell people youll be there next time. Learn some names make new acquaintances who want to help you learn whatever it is theyre doing. Im not gonna sugarcoat it  it is hard especially at first and especially if youre chronically shy like me. But it does get easier. You learn a little more about relating to other people from every interaction.Thats my approach so far. Just repeating this process. I have already started meeting great people in my community and finding ways to do stuff that Ive wanted to do for a long time. All Im doing is looking for things I want to try showing up helping out asking questions and sticking with it. I really hope you give this process or whatever you find that resonates with you in this thread a shot. Life is too short not to live it the way we want. And please PM me if you wanna talk more. Like I said Im going through a similar period of selfrealization and attempting to grow so Im more than happy to keep talking about it.

It was a random drawing I was one of the few and the only one not fired that didnt put their name in the hat.From what I heard and saw its a huge cult experience.

It is a state of mind that can arise when meditating but it is not meditation itself nor is it necessarily the ultimate goal of meditation. It can even be a hindrance for many who taste it the next time they meditate they want it back and that actually it makes it harder to achieve again because it subtly clouds your mind with desire. On the other hand it can be a powerful experience and is a stepping stone on the way to a more fully realized enlightened state. I dont mean to argue in the end this thread is useful as a series of pointsrs to expose more people to this aspect of life but it can be unhelpful for beginners I think to chase this state of mind that may not be immediately realistic for all practitioners.

What do I NEED to do?What is ENOUGH for me to be ok.I had dentists who told me that it probably wont adjust anymore due to my age. It may create issues later but the surgery is unnecessary and the success rate is not . So the best option for me was to leave it alone.I had another dentist tell me that it could ruin my teeth in the future and tried to book me an appointment to get it fixed as soon as humanly possible. It was urgent.I then asked my uncle who told me that no one should go to dentists because they are a rip off.So which version is right? What is ENOUGH care for my teeth? Are we usely purely survival because I guess we dont NEED dentists at all. However severe teeth and gum problems can lead to issues that kill you if unchecked. People with bad enough teeth pain could end up being severely malnourished for eating.Again the word enough is complicated. It is not like a number.

At first I honestly thought this couldnt be the cause of my problems but after doing the research Im feeling pretty stoked about what getting my vitD up might do for me. My doctor said it could take several months or up to a year of taking a supplement to get back into normal range from ngmL so Id urge everyone to keep that in mind. Initially I was expecting to see results within a week or something and was very disappointed when nothing changed.Also I was taking a multivitamin supplement before this and it either wasnt enough vitD for an already deep deficit or I have some other issue thats prohibiting absorption.

Eventually you stop looking at them and in time theyll begin to fade. Youll forget places events and people. Youll forget who you are.

10917562,0,t1_de5z62g,Sure.In  hurricane Katrina hit the coast line and caused major damage this is widely known.  But what isnt widely known is that before hitting land it also caused over  oil platforms to disappear.  We knew where they had been but not where they were.  We didnt know if they were  feet below the water line or  feet below the water line just waiting to rip the bottom off of a ship full of crude oil or something equally as horrible.So the government called up the US Navy minesweeper fleet that was out of Ingleside Texas at the time.  I was stationed on one of those boats and our specialty is finding things under water like mines or in this case oil rigs.So as soon as the storm cleared we set sail for the shipping lanes in and all round the coast of New Orleans.  Our mission was to basically go back and forth with out sonar to make sure there was nothing under the water that would damage the large shipping boats.  We scanned X for weeks and weeks.Minesweepers are some of the smallest boats in the Navy and rough seas truly are rough to deal with.  During our work we encountered some serious storms where we were taking  degree rolls and you were walking on the walls because you were rocking so much.  Over  of the crew became sea sick and if you were not sick you just worked and helped out everyone who was. It took a true team effort to stay on mission and keep scanning but the longer it took us the longer people in New Orleans had to wait for supplies and things that were coming in via ship.It wasnt fun but it was needed.Similar things happened off the coast in Iraq in  when I was on the USS Kitty Hawk.  We had some bad storms and even stand storms that would shut down operations when we were over  miles from land.  That is a crazy thing to see a sand storm in the middle of the Persian Gulf. ,GetMotivated,de62idk,3,t5_2rmfx

11035076,0,t3_5xiqel,Hey I live in Canada as well. I think there is a ton of great advice on here the first being getting professional help to deal with your mental health and overcoming social anxiety. Just ask your family doctor if you dont have one ask at a walk in clinic. They will be able to direct you to a mental health professional in your neighborhood. Here in Ontario I have had about  sessions over the course of  years absolutely free of charge and they have provided strategies that I use daily to manage anxiety.Next you MUST finish highschool. You are not getting jobs because of a lack of experience at your age and because you have no educational certifications. You must demonstrate to an employer that you are trying to improve yourself through documents granted by the state such as a secondary school diploma. That said this is no easy task. Im not sure of your province or region but just google adult learning center and you will find a free provincially operated center in your region. You will be able to learn with other adults to get your secondary school diploma. None of that high school bullshit. Many people in similar situations trying to get their lives together. The program is free usually flexible with online and correspondence options do it from home with or without internet access at your own pace.I think if you can set  attinable goals get professional mental help and start an adult secondary school program in a few short years you will be able to find some decent employment and help your family as best as possible.Last but not least I hope you have just one friend in this world that you can share a cup of coffee with and try to figure out this life with. If not I hope you find one maybe at school.Anyway good luck sending courage and strength to take those next steps.,GetMotivated,deisuez,1,t5_2rmfx
11035902,0,t3_5xiqel,For me I just try to remember to break things down into simple forms and tasks just to get by each day when everything feels and becomes shit. I never even had the slightest idea of the mental state I would now be in and different shit I have to deal with. On the days where I cant really even feel that Im alive or where I dont know why I keep going I keep in mind that Ive gotten this far despite everything having become worse than before and I remember that if I keep going one day Ill look back and be proud of myself for what Ive gotten past Ill have happier days and a better life eventually but its guaranteed that none of that will happen if I give up already. I also will break down anything I feel I cant begin to tackle into simple tasks all a piece of the puzzle. This is probably all clich but fuck it it works for me and its probably become clich because it works for a lot of others. ,GetMotivated,deiweq8,2,t5_2rmfx

11050236,0,t3_5xpbtt,Why do people go to the extreme ends of the spectrum? Its going to be either...Work you ass off.  hours a week! Do not have free time. And youll succeed! or How to become a billionaire in  weeks?. I think the key lies in balancing between the two. You have to work towards your goals but you also have to be smart about it. Always! Or youll end up like all the unknown people that work like bulls all their lives only to end up miserable and bitter. Check out the  principle. A lot of the successful people were very smart about their work and often decent amount of luck was involved in their success. Most also have tunnel vision about their goal which helps them focus into one specific thing while disregarding everything else. This allows them to keep their goal in sight which in turn helps them being motivated more often. Im personally not such person. That is why I admire greatly Leonardo DaVinci as he was great not in one particular field but in many. The only true genius in my opinion.        On the topic Im very much like that myself. On top of that Ive spread myself thin on dozens of different things. Its hard but Im accepting it slowly. What helps me stay focused hence motivated is planning scheduling and writing everything down. Writing down every goal then splitting it into smaller tasks. Creating weekly schedules with everything I want to do during the week. Eventually everything becomes a habit.   Personal example Im web developer and one of the most demotivating things is when youve had experience with something and youve just started to feel confident about your skills and a problem or a brand new technology comes out that sends you back in the kindergarten. Or the steep learning curve. You dont learn the programming alphabet by starting from A then B C until you know the whole alphabet. No no no! You have to first start with C and take for granted how A and B work. Then you go to Y because you need it to understand B. Itll take you quite a bit time to actually see and understand the whole picture. Im just accepting that its part of the job and its normal. I know that if I dont constantly improve myself as a developer and as a person for that matter Ill become obsolete before I get old. You just have to love the negative aspects of the undertaking.      Well that became about  times longer than expected. I hope it makes sense!,GetMotivated,dekiwwl,1,t5_2rmfx

11318762,0,t3_61gzkf,My biggest issue in getting over the hurdle of not knowing what you want to do has to do with committment. There are many people who know they like one thing more than the other for example liking chocolate better than liking vanilla. Sure you probably know what you like better but have you ever committed to being a person that likes it? It sounds dumb with chocolate and vanilla instead of say choosing a partner in marriage but I believe it is just as important in terms of committment. Once you make the change in your head that you commit to being a chocolate lover you change the way you think about it. You know you chose chocolate you committed to it and that is part of you and you know it. If you dont do this with simple things then you will never know what it feels like to choose a situation or a person because you commit to liking that instead of just going with the flow because youre pretty sure its something you like.Commitment will show you what you truly enjoy even if you have to commit to multiple things to see if it truly is for you.Good luck!,GetMotivated,dfeyobc,1,t5_2rmfx

I set my goal higher than I have ever set one before worked my ASS off for more hours than any one of my peers know about and achieved it. Berklee is the only school I applied to as it is my dream school so this acceptance means everything to me!

11417509,0,t1_dfq52x9,I also suggest to try weight watchers  I would recommend checking out a meeting in your area and learning what it is about I have used their system for over  years to lose weight and maintain my weight I originally lost  lbs on it and when my weight starts to creep up again I will follow it again. It teaches healthy food choices and proper portion sizes. If you have a hard time with emotional eating then I highly suggest going to the meetings and not just using the online version as you will get more support and will likely meet other people with the same problem. The meetings keep you accountable and you learn a lot from the other people there. It is also very affordable  a month here in Canada and you eat normal everyday food. And nothing is totally off limits. It takes a lot of discipline and time to lose a significant amount of weight and there is no quick fix. Good luck! ,GetMotivated,dfq5vjt,5,t5_2rmfx
11420407,0,t3_62z9cr,Used to have a similar story but I was just slightly over weight where I was though demanded perfection. I took a photo of a celebrity I idolised and put it on my mirror as a goal to work towards. I started walking more even for  mins a day its  mins more than youd usually do and it does help. I also cut down sugar took about a week before the cravings for sugar stopped and now when I see a dessert I cant think my way out of eating it like a mental task I weigh up the effort taken to burn it off and I decide Id rather chill out than spend and hour and a half doing cardio. I also cut carbs slightly not massively stopped eating red meat and started eating half a plate of veg with nearly every meal. It took me about  weeks to notice a substantial difference in my size. All with minimal effort its all about your diet sadly  is exercise. Keeping an honest food diary and working every day to improve on the day before is also a top tip from me. I know the cycle I know the mind set. If you keep a track of your progress you can use it as a time capsule keeping going back and thinking wow I used to eat so much as you improve your relationship with food will change. Im happier healthier and better since I changed good from comfort to fuel. Peoples hurtful comments make it harder they dont motivate you to lose weight.

I know people who chant USA are still critical of their own government it happens to each side when the opposite leadership is in power.

Judging by the percentage of black students who currently drop out its a pretty fair assessment to say theyre less inclined to school.Dude your entire thing is a perfect way for more discrimination to spew forth. Just put black people in jail from the start theyre more likely to commit crimes. Take away babies from mothers because theyre more likely to kill them. Dont let white people come to a public school because theyre more likely to shoot the other kids. Jesus fucking Christ man do you know how easy itd be to discriminate using your logic? The way forward is to look at each person and treat them like any other person. If theyre good at sports theyre good at sports. If theyre smart then theyre smart. You shouldnt look at a persons skin tone and then put them in a box based on that. You shouldnt expect something whether good or bad about someone based on something they had no choice in. Caring about racial differences is the reason racism exists. Thats a fact. How does continuing to care about race fix that? I know you mean well thats very clear. I think at the end of the day most people will agree that something needs to be done about racism. But reading your post I saw all the reasons why racism is a thing. Why sexism is a thing. Why homophobia is a thing. There are differences no doubt. Most of those are superficial and have no bearing on that person and who they are.Dont take race into account.

Sure there will be a couple rehearsals and some travel time but most weeks I just wake up and try to find something to do. ,GetMotivated,dgy9ste,4,t5_2rmfx
