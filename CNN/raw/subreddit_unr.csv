3831940,0,t1_cqt1kbz,I know you think that you think you got me in a ahha moment but no I dont.  Plenty of European countries get along with law enforcement agencies that dont arm their officers.  Furthermore the police officers in these agencies dont shoot citizens on a daily basis.  As it stands our police are in an arms race with our citizens so therefore people get shot.  ,unr,cqt2o7g,-4,t5_2srmo

I feel like your experience differs based on what you make of it. Make sure to get out and do things. I didnt my first semester and it sucked but since then its been pretty amazing.,unr,cszzc0s,2,t5_2srmo

6306054,0,t3_41wnum,I graduated Chem E from UNR with a . GPA and as president of AICHE chemical engineering club and another club. Overall I made time to volunteer TA classes participate in hobbies  hours a week and have time for friends and video games.That said junior year I did very little of the extra stuff. I spent probably  hours or more a week on school that year. Its probably a little easier now with the changes they made to the Chem E curriculum at UNR two semesters of thermo one semester of P Chem IIRC.It is one of the very hardest majors at UNR and unless other changes were made several of the professors especially Vasquez only give one or two As per course making it very competitive for the top students.The  rule definitely applies to grades in Chem E. I had classmates with a .. cumulative mostly Bs in engineering classes who had a lot more free time. Some of them simply had to work to afford college or wanted to have even more of a social life and the time it would take to ace our classes was not compatible with their priorities. Most people dont need to get a superhigh GPA in engineering honestly. The main reasons are if you want to go on to med  law  PhD after school. ,unr,cz6fe6f,5,t5_2srmo

6775987,0,t3_48khkq,They will all be social. Go for argenta. You can always make friends in nye if you want to be around constant parties and juvenile drama. This is the perspective of someone who didnt live in either dorm but spent a lot of time in both with friendsgirlfriend. Its also potentially outdated.,unr,d0kcb63,2,t5_2srmo
