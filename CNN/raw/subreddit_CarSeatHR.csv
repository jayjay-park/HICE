7485700,0,t3_4hw4ee,I think most of the album is breaking ground for some new themes but with that said Unforgiving Girl Shes Not An is the most thematically twin fantasy track on the album. It comes across in my opinion as a song about finally getting over a relationshipgt Four years I hadnt had a clue suddenly I can look through... your eyes again and a relationship that never worked well in the first place because the affection between the couple was more one sided in its naturegt shes not my ex we never met but do you still think of me more examples can be found on Twin Fantasy gt I wanted to put my arms around them the shoulders of the one he is affectionate towards but the conductor looked at me funny his advances are rejected.also some lyrics from his older collection of work also share this theme gt I know we were never quite lovers as such  gtIve never slept next to someone who wanted to sleep next to me. These are all very similar to the theme of twin fantasy and Wills earlier cannon which highlighted the feeling that things would never be the same after a relationship for example gtBehind every great love story lies a great suicide. You cant give yourself completely and keep the man inside  There are some tracks that make use of Wills talent for wordplay such as some lyrics in The Ballad of Costa Concordia gt I have lost and I always will be which is similar to play on words at the start of the Gun Song gt Im not hung up on you but heres why I hung up. Destroyed by Hippie powers has the line in classic introspective and intimate CSHR fashion gtwhat happened to that chubby boy that .. and smiled at everything and loved the beach boys Similar to how Will mentions the influence of Michael Stipe from R.E.M. in his previous album he does it again here. Will has said time and time again that the Beach Boys are a large source of inspiration for him and its not the first time he has incorporated that fact into his songs. In How to Leave Town he has a track about Brian Wilson of the beach boys.The last track on Teens of Denial is an obvious homage to his interest in anthropomorphic animal subculture the track is basically a reworking of Joe gets kicked out of school for using Drugs With Friends but says this isnt a problem which he referenced in album  my fingertips are burned off from touching the too hot touchpad of my macbook pro as I casually scroll through fetish based forms of which I am an active member and I think that its great that hes putting that out there and not backing away from just because some people think its strange.In conclusion I think Teens of Denial is more of a pivot from How to Leave Town than it is from Twin Fantasy Twin Fantasy is sort of a stand alone and completed piece of work making it harder to really use as a place to move from. Thematically I think Nervous Young Man Monomania Starving While Living and My Back is Killing Me Baby are more closely related to Twin Fantasy than Teens of Denial.,CarSeatHR,d2t309t,3,t5_3ambn

7525632,0,t3_4iet8v,This has to be up there for one of my favorite CSH albums. The layering is amazing and it kind of makes me miss Wills solo days. Up All Night is one of my favorite tracks on the album because I listened to it at  in the morning while maybe under the influence of some substances. All in all its a solid album that I think all Car Seat fans should give a listen.,CarSeatHR,d2xml14,2,t5_3ambn

7776078,0,t1_d3pyimo,His analysis was way more in depth than I thought it would be and I dig it. Not only does he discuss the music itself but the concepts and lyrics that really make this album shine. Also Will earned another .,CarSeatHR,d3q2s12,1,t5_3ambn
7833522,0,t1_d3wc9ps,you are right about the costs of distributing digitally being relatively minimal. However it doesnt end up as pure profit because there are a ton of costs that go into creating an album that this money will go into paying back. In his book Donald Passman gives a range of kk for an advance out of which a new indie band would pay recording costs. Recording costs are also a lot more than you would think and probably suck up most of an advance. On top of this theyre having to eat a  loss that they werent expecting. They are also going to have to pay for rush delivery probably included in that k for the repress because there arent that many presses left in the world and most of them are overbooked as is.  All in all it is hard for any record let alone one taking a loss like this to even make back its advance aka breaking even. Record companies take a lot of losses and bank on at least some of their artists hitting. While its an incredible album its hard to see it selling enough to even go gold just not really a thing in the indie rock sphere anymore . That being said the band is an investment and with the critical acclaim theyve been garnering I think the hope is that the payoff comes on the back end and they can keep making money off of them as is the case with Pavement and The New Pornographers.Im sorry if it seems like I am ragging on your response or just in general going overboard but its important to realize that this situation has a huge impact in a fragile industry.     ,CarSeatHR,d3wk0n9,2,t5_3ambn

8043246,0,t3_4pcol5,I was pretty confused about this too. Im pretty sure Wills exboyfriend is a mtf transgender so it might make sense that its about her. I figured that hed stop singing about her at this point though Monomania was the breakup album to that relationship and that was  but maybe not.It only gives insight on tiny details and references instead of the big picture but this song has a genius entry with verified annotations by Will.,CarSeatHR,d4k4xo0,5,t5_3ambn

8748168,0,t1_d6z12dy,Take note that this isnt necessarily his nd band. This is Leos project which Will is in. Four Ways To Say Goodbye was grossly neglected IMHO and I hardly find anybody talking about it outside of this sub. That EP is one of my favorites. Give me a few mins and Ill get copy another comment where I linked all of the Leesburg gangs bandcamps.Edit This comment was posted under a video where Will brought them all up to play one of Degnans songs. The video can be found here Here is a list of all the guys that went up.gtDegnan on guitar a.k.a Naked Days gtAmanda on trumpet a.k.a Pelican Sister gtLeoI didnt see a clear shot but Im almost certain its him on keyboard a.k.a American Holly I seriously recommend checking out all of their music. Degnan just dropped an album and is working on a new one. Leo is dropping something soon. They also all have an album together called Withered Oldies  ,CarSeatHR,d6z6c6g,5,t5_3ambn
