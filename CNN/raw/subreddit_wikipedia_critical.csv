9580901,0,t1_d9t7s0n,The discussion at ANI is fine I pointed to it as just a general overview of the issues I probably shouldve posted a textpost for more context as to what I was thinking of discussing. I  find the deletions in general rather concerning especially from a former COI editor. Things like this indicate Light has a somewhat kneejerk nomination process and it looks like theyre not holding up well going through the usual edit wars. Im mostly thinking about things wrt to how people with clear CIR issues should be best dealt with before ANI it seems theres been more ANI cases regarding that than usual largely because nonadministrative resolutions are only so effective and even moreso when you have a poor grasp on policyEnglish. I worry by the time an ANI case comes around the damage has already been done and several editors have to clean up after the mess. I hope maybe the TBAN will have a positive effect on them. Well have to see.I was initially worried the quick transition from COI editor to deletionist makes me worry they might have been planning to establish a good reputation by deleting several bad articles in order to mask more cryptic promotional edits thats probably a little too cynical looking further into it given it was restricted to an obscure company whose article is now salted. ,wikipedia_critical,d9u1ijg,1,t5_3hfv4
