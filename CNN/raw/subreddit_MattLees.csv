4151991,0,t3_34ipej,So this is interesting but I did want to offer some feedback on the Bioshock Infinite issue.So to me Bioshock does with politics what the Daily Show did in the run up to the  election  made it seem like its all meaningless and is all equally as bad.Now when one side is a racist patriarchy you have to do some serious gymnastics to get into that position.Infinity manages it by first showing us the Founders ascendent and making us hate them then showing us the Resistence ascendent and making us hate them as well at least it tries pretty hard to preach to us as Dewitt preaches to Elizabeth that they are both equally as loathsome.Ultimately I think this was done as you posit as a way to avoid taking sides but at the end of the day all youve done is set up a false equivalence between the two sides.,MattLees,crtjh4f,1,t5_30ozw

4467140,0,t1_cstqxdd,Foucault wanted freefloating discourse for precisely this reason! Perhaps it comes of the stillpresent myth that friendship which has become a far more murky concept online is about permanent mutual agreement. Habermas said that successful communication requires among other things that the meaning is agreeable which always seemed a little sad to me. For what its worth I think the hate is mostly reflexive  like the various meme responses on Reddit. No less virulent or pervasive for that of course. If he were working solo would you feel less uncomfortable? Is it really ? Fuck sake whats happening to the day?,MattLees,cstrc6t,2,t5_30ozw
