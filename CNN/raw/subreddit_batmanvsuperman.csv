7024715,0,t3_4br2mj,There is one broken arm in a fight but there is nothing I would call gory.,batmanvsuperman,d1clqxo,1,t5_31vp8
7027584,1,t3_4bvhl3,I dont see how anyone thought that it was great. A lot of parts in that movie made me go like what were they thinking when they filmed that. Batman killing people Doomsday is created with Zods body  Lexs DNA people needing a Superman trial after an incident in Africa when the end of Man of Steel destroys half the city Marthas your Moms name? Cool were friends now. shoehorned in cameos that they told everyone about and finally the movie being the exactly what we saw from the trailer. All of these things are huge flaws in my opinion. I went in with low expectations but the movie still disappointed me.,batmanvsuperman,d1cxheu,-3,t5_31vp8
