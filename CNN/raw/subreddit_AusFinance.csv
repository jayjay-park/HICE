The CFMEU has a lot of leftists who drag the union into political issues anti Iraq war etc and the antizionist boycott divestment and sanctions movement lobbies these guys very hard. Another issue to look out for is armaments manufacturers whos subsidiaries may make cluster bombs or small components for nuclear ICBMs.I recall during the Maritime strike in the late nineties that the Maritime Union were holding up the retrenchment by refusing to sign off on the final payment of superannuation funds as the union officials were also on the board there.IIRC may not have happened.I should note however that there is a sound economic argument to ethical funds management decisions like this. It says that companies have activities which have a negative effect on the community international or local are in themselves an unsound investment in the longterm as their operations are usually not sustainable either due to resource depletion litigation or legislation  e.g.community outrage resulting in a ban.  I recall in my job at a fund manager in the mid s that there was a lot of correspondence form both investors and the general community to divest from Gunns Ltd which was a pretty awful company. The standard response was that the funds first duty was to enable to a financial return to the unit holders and as such the policies would not be altered to avoid companies like this. Later down the track the company went bankrupt due to various things. There is a long lobbying campaign going to ban all coal exports from Australia so theoretically if this happened it would not be wise to invest would it?Edit I should add that an opposite to ethical funds made a debut several years that specifically targeted sin stocks which follows a theory that in times of economic hardship the population tends to drink smoke and gamble more so would invest in alcohol manufacturers cigarette companies and gambling eg Aristocrat.,AusFinance,clp5gq1,0,t5_2uo3q

Capital gains isnt as tricky but I would let an accountant fill you in on the variety of options that can happen depending on how the holding is structured. For my  cents worth and based on a few assumptions I am making about your situation. I would have you purchase  of the property your mum could gift this is a requirement for lending purposes you her lump sum for the house deposit. this will have an impact on centrelinkgovt super if its a factor for your mum and assuming you have the borrowing capacity in the first place.Then have her pay you rent for the property it should be at market rates to keep on the safe side of ATO but the lower end of the market is still market....

3337794,0,t1_cp8pcnm,Splitting my reply into two this is a practical explanation of offset and why the stock market shouldnt be feared.Offset short version a savings account where the amount in the account is considered to have been paid off of the mortgage. Interest is generally calculated daily. Something to note because youre effectively reducing the amount of interest you have to pay as opposed to earning interest money invested into an offset is taxfree. I hope that makes sense. Say you put k into a stock that pays  dividend you need to pay tax on the  you earn. If you put k into a term deposit and your home loan is  interest you pay  less interest that  is not reduced by tax. So offset accounts are great tools to manage your money with.gtMainly I have a inherent distrust of the stock market.... What would you say to dissuade me?!Stocks are the highest returning asset class in the long run. I cant find the studies right now unfortunately and I cant remember how much higher the return is but I remember it was a significant amount. So basically every investment you make needs to be tempered by your risk aversion. If you really dislike risk you have to accept that you will earn very little. Lose money even  as holding cash is the least risky thing you can do but if you factor in inflation you generally lose money by holding cash. If you can stomach an unlimited amount of risk youd be buying random speculative stocks like oil exploration or tech stocks. High risk  high return.How would I dissuade you? The stock market is very  dimensional in terms of investment. You can adjust according to your knowledge and risk tolerance. You can buy stocks for growth stocks for dividends stocks that will go up when the market goes up or stocks that will go up when the market goes down. You can invest in sectors get exposure to other currencies and hedge your investments. If youre not knowledgeable in stocks you can buy ETFs which do all those things for you. Because theres so many more dynamics involved the returns you can make scale up very well the more you know whereas you can be a finance guru but youll still only earn your standard interest rate at a bank. This means the potential for returns is vastly superior on the stock market. This is a huge topic so to keep it short the only thing I can say now you is that you have the possibility of making much more on the stock markets and with arguably not much more risk if you know what youre doing.

3457240,0,t1_cplg038,why does a paper trade have to start on todays date? You are missing the complete point of paper trading. Games like the ASX Sharemarket game help you understand the mechanics of buying and selling and limit orders and so on but aside from getting on a leaderboard it is not what I consider true paper trading.     Here is an example of a paper tradePick some US ETFs that look good today VVVTI and change the date you bought them to March . Now compare the price to October .  Thats how much money you could lose even when using the best information available to pretty much anyone at the time.  Once you can accept that even the best ETFs in the world have a massive downside then its a matter of developing a plan or a set of rules that would hopefully see you come out in profit or would have stopped you buying it in the first place.  Now using those rules apply them to different time periods and different ETFs or individual companies.  By doing this you are working out which rules work out best most of the time and which rules end in failure most of the time and how much time it takes for the result good or bad to match your expectation.    The point of paper trading is not to see how much money you can make on paper but to develop the rules by which you will follow.    There are some very smart experienced people who have already written the best rules. You can even test those rules on the same time periods to see which ones knew what they were talking about or how long before they were right or wrong.    In the end the challenge is either remembering the rules you consider the best or following them despite your emotional state at the time.  ,AusFinance,cpmcnee,2,t5_2uo3q

5706155,0,t3_3t9cdl,Differing opinionI think Accountants have no business offering SMSF advice.  Because. When you consolidate your super you lose your insurance cover and from experience the accountants just say whoops... forgot about that.  Setting up insurance for many people is hard because of preexisting medical conditions.. Theres a conflict of interest. The accountants often do it often because its an extra entity to do a tax return for each year.. How is it in the best interests of EVERY SINGLE client who walks through the accountants door to roll into an SMSF?  It clearly isnt.  These accountants should be doing proper research and looking into whether a cheap super fund would be more suitable.. Too many people are uneducated about SMSF and stuff it up all the time.. Too many people have no idea why theyre even in one.  Usually the wife has rolled her super over on the husbandsaccountants whim.  Shell be the one left holding that fund when he dies.. Investment Strategies Death Benefit nominations are often paid only lip service by the accountants template.   cash or shares is not a strategy.. People screw up buying a house through super all the time.  I had  calls in a month asking me to give them advice that it was a good idea to buy an investment property in super.  Each one of them had  days to get the paperwork back to westpac and the loan acceptance was now unconditional.  Not ... going... to happen!  Unfortunately financial planners can be sued by the smsf owner or pretty much any one of their beneficiaries ifwhen it unravels.The only people who should be giving advice are. Financial planners who have done specialist education on the topic past the mere regulatory requirement.. Undergo continuous professional development on the specific topic of SMSF. Can provide holistic advice about the SMSF not just the tax structure itself.  That means  What happens when you die  how to invest  appropriate analysis of Life insurance levels  asset structuring so there is enough cash flow to pay pensions   analyse full benefitsdisadvantages of holding investment property in super depending on clients age and tax bracket including analysis that compares holding it in clients own name important for negativepositive gearing.  educate client on their responsibilities  educate client on common nonos.A professional should know when to walk away from a client who is going into SMSF for the wrong reasons Examples . MLC are wankers may well be the truth but it is not enough justification to roll into an SMSF.. Ive read some great stuff about Vanguard index funds may be true but you can get into Vanguard at wholesale rates via some cheap retail platforms and avoid all the crap involved in running an SMSF.. Im going to trade Forex  Ive been a trader myself in shares and forex and personally known dozens of forex traders since .  Not ONE single forex trader made money consistently despite subscribing to all kinds of newsletters and live feeds of watching others place trades.  Every single one lost pretty much all their money.  The only forex traders who make money are the ones who are trading with imaginary money.,AusFinance,cx4ejwz,6,t5_2uo3q

This isnt really a yes no question more of a what do I value more right now question Having a place to live that I own which may change in value in the long run? Or do I want to save my money for when I am likely to get a better deal. Either way a cost is likely involved either in timeemotional distress or money. Finally this Would you rather your money go toward paying off an asset that you then own or to a landlord never to be seen again? Does waiting really save you anything in the long run if you need to pay rent in the mean time? I believe several people have already linked to the below rent vs buy calculatorgt Though I want to point out again that the financial cost needs to also be weighed against the emotional cost.

Why not do it the right way and have more money rather than pay the bank to lose some of it?? Get an account at another bank put the login details in a safe or give to your mum so you cant take it out. Then as soon as you get paid transfer x whatever figure you decide on into that account so you never see it and learn to live with the remainder. Even set up an autopayment if your pay is Wednesday night do an auto transfer on Thursday. Then your mum can give you back the logon details in a year and you have however much you planned to save.Ill answer your question  the cheapest loan youd get for that amount would be through ratesetter.com.au and set you back at least  per annum after fees and interest. Now I can guarantee that you wont make more than  on the share market and in fact to compensate for the extra risk and tax youd really need to be making  to be ahead.

9998406,0,t3_5iq3u6,The manufacturing sector in Australia definitely has had a role in the economy historically but it has never been as significant as it was in the US. Its easy to rally around the cries of they took our jobs and play on our patriotic tendencies to blame our Asian trading partners but at this point in time even if we didnt have mass imports from China Korea et. al. Id argue that  of those manufacturing jobs we shipped overseas would be automated anyway and the jobs still wouldnt exist. This is what we need to be concerned about and preparing for in our political landscape  the growing power of capital as income becomes increasingly attached to owning things rather than doing things. I love trade and capitalism but growing income inequality is part of this frustration and drive behind political change.    Deleted income inequality analysis Sorry got distracted. If you look at the raw numbers in your ABS source its hardly clear that those who used to work in manufacturing now work in retail although being inspired by s analysis I can see why youd take that angle as a starting point. There has been far greater employment growth in the Health Care and Social Assistance field which does have lower weekly earnings on average but not nearly as significantly as retail trade does it basically would fall on the mid point in between the two lines of your chart. Additionally there has also been an explosion in employment in Professional Scientific and Technical Services which has seen much greater wage growth over the last decade and placed it well ahead of manufacturing in terms of average weekly earnings and similar growth in education which is about lineball with manufacturing.    So whats driving the employment growth in these areas? Not surprisingly its tied to your point about manufacturing jobs going overseas! As we got rid of the barriers to trade we realised that there are a whole heap of people in Asia able to utilise economies of scale more efficiently than us and willing to be paid much less than us. This left those unskilled labour participants in the economy without a job to go to but thankfully Australia had a great strength in its education system. Accordingly many of those formerly unskilled participants used those services and became skilled much to the benefit of us all as we now have more engineers teachers and health workers ready to play to our economys strengths rather than wasting their time working on making inferior electronics in dangerous manufacturing environments that we can now get from our trading partners overseas. This also had the side benefit of giving access to much bigger markets for those firms who were really good at doing things which they could export mining agriculture the remaining manufacturers.    All in all I just want to say its easy to look at manufacturing and feel all doom and gloomy but that is only one of three industries in that entire data pack that is seeing employment declines over the last decade. The other is agriculture and automation is targeting both of those sectors pretty heavily media is pretty flatin minor decline yay internet?. The other  industries are seeing growing employment while mining has decreased in the last  years it is still well above  levels. Australia has handled globalisation quite well and transitioned much better than other countries. I just dont know whether were positioned to handle automation as well as we handled globalisation but maybe Im just in a bad mood today.,AusFinance,dbatk4m,8,t5_2uo3q

Properties in every suburb closeish to the CBD are selling like wildfire in Hobart at the moment thanks to rentervestors buying up everything There are even good suburbs with damp dark pockets in them South Hobart so Id say local knowledge is a must there. If the markets slows and buyers can spend more than the open home thinking about if they want to buy there and then or not those properties would be so hard to sell because they are lucky to get a few hours of sun at one end of the day! Rental returns are also better in the slightly further out suburbs I have found MoonahGlenorchy because the inner suburbs are so saturated with rentals already I guess renters can be a bit picky?Also lots of dodgy tactics by many agents here at the moment pushing you into unconditional contracts no building inspectionspressure you to get an inspection before you put the offer in while telling you offers will be presented in a few days and that will be it sold so youd better hurry and get a contract in ASAPWeve put offers on three houses in the past year and missed out to cash buyers every time who then put it on the rental market the next week. And from following realestate.com religiously Id say thats happening with maybe half of the houses sold in Hobart in the past year and a half not including apartments!. Aside from being incredibly frustrating its also probably a blessing in disguise because what happens if all these investors decide to move their money elsewhere all of a sudden? Maybe we will finally be able to buy a home!Also the university is planning to move into the city in a few years so buying near the current campus is also a huge risk as there are so many shitty student houses there currently that sell vastly overpriced because of the guaranteed student renters,AusFinance,dca6uvc,1,t5_2uo3q

Usually there are steep fees for breaking with the fixed rate but you can shop around to remortgage at the end of the fixed rate period without penalty.gt Why would a variable rate be higher than a fixed rate?Lets check anybody on the Internet. My first search came up with ING Direct| Variable Rate | Fixed Rate ||||| . |  yr  . | | |  yr  . || |  yr  . |As you can see the revert variable rate is higher. And heres the thing. Its variable. If you get stuck being unable to sell your home and your mortgage switches to the variable rate because you cant remortgage then youre at the mercy of whatever that rate is.Oh and the revert variable rate isnt directly tied to the RBA rate. The bank can make their variable rate whatever they want.Sometimes banks offer tracker deals which are variable in nature  for a fixed length period say  years  and these are sometimes cheaper than the fixed rate when the banks assess long term risk of a rate rise. I have one such tracker mortgage myself right now. And it will revert to the more expensive revert variable rate at the end of those  years.,AusFinance,ddq6tf5,2,t5_2uo3q

Have the new  interest only. So far its still a secured home loan so ought to still get the best interest rate.. Make a lump sum repayment to this loan  from the offset account leaving it at zero.. Redraw the  back out and transfer to your investment platformbroking account.If you have a good banker you should be able to do all this on the same day.You now have a separate investment loan with a good rate interest only that is super easy to work out your deductions at the end of the year. The offset account is still linked to the home mortgage. If you want to be extra effective you can get the investment dividendsdistributions directed into the home loan to pay off your mortgage quicker.       ,AusFinance,dfpnv3d,2,t5_2uo3q

11444436,0,t1_dft5ysl,Dont know if youre missing my point. Im pretty certain people have lost all or even more than all of their money on property. You just dont hear about it. Enron was huge and a scam fuck even one tel and that airline I cant remember its name these two were just bad businesses. A  drop in a property that youre  lvred against means youve just dusted all your capital. Also if you spend some dough to put a few garden gnomes etc. you are fucked. A lot of the capital improvements arent counted in property since is ppor and doesnt carry any tax burdens. An NTA is a fucking NTA. If theyre having shit like goodwill on balance sheet and its billion and their assets are comprised of K use the K... Enron was bullshitting and speculating on the energy market whilst booking their losses to subsidiaries see how Nick Leeson fucked Barrings I dare say same story. Bottom line is you cant protect yourself  against anything...I feel youve made up your mind and Im not going to argue so lets agree to disagree on this.

11444452,0,t1_dft5ysl,Thats true for your own residence...if you own it.  In that case it always has value as a roof over your head.Other property? If the price collapses and the value is less than the mortgage? Nope. Thats not safe. If the ripple effect means people lose jobs and investors cant cover interest payments because people are moving back in with mum and dad so rents fall? Safe? Hmmmm.  If someone has an investment loan and the bank refuses to refinance?  Safe is if people own their properties outright and can ride out falls in property values and periods of lowno rental income. The concern expressed by the regulators is that housing for people with mortgages especially investor mortgages is now unsafe.,AusFinance,dft7ves,2,t5_2uo3q

For example some countries count garages balconies basements attics etc. in the floor space calculation. Others completely leave these areas out.Its a mess and very very difficult to compare. This myth that australia has the biggest homes has been floating around for a while. Its completely false. You only need to spend a short period of time overseas or talk to people from the US to compare house sizes and see how false this data is or talk to people from europe to see how false it is with apartments.,AusFinance,dg3stxe,3,t5_2uo3q
