7577201,0,t3_4id6pl,Hi!  I am a woman and an aerospace engineer.  One thing that I discovered was that my schooling UCLA and my work were VERY different.  Engineering tends to be more practical and hands on.  Some of the best engineers that I met did not have straight As in school.  Another thing is that I worked at NASA for a while and then I worked at a defense contractor.  My days differed greatly with each job.  At NASA I had a pretty even split between handson work control room work and computer model work.  I LOVED my job there!  If it wasnt in the middle of the desert and if I wasnt young and having babies I easily would have stayed.  For handson work we would go to the airplane hangar and do testing on a certain project.  These projects would probably happen about every three or four months.  As I worked at a flight test center my control room work was described as Hours of boredom interrupted by moments of sheer terror.  That was really kind of true.  While it seems glamorous monitoring flights in the control room could get kind of boring.  Finally my work on the computer was actually quite interesting.  I would create models of the part of the airplane that we were concerned about and run it in software that would show whether or not it was safe.  I also made a lot of presentations and wrote reports on research that we were doing.  Overall because of the mix of things it was very interesting work.My second job with a defense contractor was very different but really no less interesting.  I actually did mostly computer work.  There I modeled entire systems of satellites and determined things like whether or not it would burn up in the sun during the time that it was in the sun during launch.  Thats just one example but its a good one.  As I rose again through the ranks I started to be able to take on more responsibility which meant going to more meetings and making more presentations.  At the defense contractor at first a typical day would consist of getting to work making myself a cup of tea sitting down and checking my schedule and email to make sure that I was on the right track and then working at the computer until lunch.  Lunch with friends and then computer work until I left.  But keep in mind that Im very social and I found the work to be very interesting.  I often had to interface with other people in order to understand it and so I would get the social interaction that I liked.Id recommend it because it can honestly be a LOT of different things.  Good luck!,Career,d33hp5y,1,t5_2qusi
