1195031,0,t1_ci3zzeq,I said if we draw with Italy and Uruguay then we are almost certain to go through providing we beat CR which is true. That would put us on  points and no team in the history of the WC has gone out at the group stages on  points. ,ThreeLions,ci425ns,2,t5_2u7e6
1221698,0,t1_ci71xtp,If England and Brazil both win their groups they couldnt face each other until the final. If England wins their group I think theyd have a good chance of facing Spain or the Netherlands in the quarters. Germany in the semis seems quite likely though assuming the teams involved continue to advance.,ThreeLions,ci725fa,1,t5_2u7e6
1327011,0,t1_ciivirm,Not a whole lot of shame in that as weve played fairly well in what is arguably the toughest group  one which is much more difficult than the group of death your media has been playing up all tournament.

8101068,0,t1_d4qmoak,Im not sure. But I think youre just being reactive. The England job is one of the biggest jobs in world football. If the FA was intelligent and had been putting out feelers for the past couple years then they should have some credible and impressive candidates lined up. I mean Mourinho has spoken about his desire for the England job so it still clearly carries weight.,ThreeLions,d4qmsuw,7,t5_2u7e6
