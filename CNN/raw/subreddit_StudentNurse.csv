I usually put the disease in the middle of a piece of paper then make categories around it like pathophysiology ss diagnosis treatment nursing interventions medications. Under those categories I put bullet points others may draw lines and bubble out if you know what I mean. Ill sometimes draw pictures or include charts.I find this super helpful because I can condense  powerpoint slides and tons of pages from my textbook into one piece of paper. That way Im not flipping through a lot of information to understand the big picture.

On the other be prepared for any of the possible outcomes even bad ones. Im not sure if there is a third option for you like doing ADN now and a BSN  years down the line or if a new field will open up in  years that you can go into for growth while having an ADN.Ultimately it is your call.

3371191,0,t3_2yqaou,My last placement in nursing school was in theatre for  weeks. We were rotated in different theatres. So one day I was in a general theatre the next I saw a caesarian neuro ortho etc. I recommend just making an effort to see everything and step out of your comfort zone. I made a point of asking to scrub into a big burns debridement surgery and it was actually one of my best times in nursing school. I was really overwhelmed at first at all the instrument names etc. Dont expect to know everything on the first day. And know why your patients are there having that surgery.

3682748,0,t3_32idkn,I never used test banks but that said... I would always Google search NCLEX fluids and electrolytes or whatever the unit was. I had many repeats of these questions on tests.So is it actually cheating to use a test bank? Im on the fence. A student can learn and retain through doing as many questions as they can pack in. They always told us to do as many questions as you can and didnt ever tell us that any source was off limits. Most NCLEX study plans are based off of doing many tests until you know the material. Memorizing the proper answer to a question means you recognize the right answer and can apply that right answer to similar questions even if you do not know the material backwards and forwards. Your professors are also apparently very lazy. It is also true that using the process of elimination by identifying opposite answers one of these is usually right the odd answer and just identifying the questions stem can often yield the best answer even if a student doesnt really know the material very well. ,StudentNurse,cqc234s,5,t5_2vqzl

3956467,0,t3_350hyp,Are you me? Im in the exact same boat and I need to make at least an  on the HESI. One thing I feel like I realized too late is that its beneficial to study practice NCLEX questions so you can learn how to rationalize the answers. I never understood why it was recommended or how it would benefit my learning until now I dont know what youve struggled with but my problem all semester was that even though I was busting my ass doing the readings it wasnt teaching me how to critically think in the tests. All the information is so new to me that I felt overwhelmed enough studying all the disease processes and trying to keep up with meds but that was all I was prepared for... being asked to explain processes and meds which is probably why I did well in clinical... but when it came to the unit exams I would bomb because all the questions seemed so tricky to me I kick myself for secondguessing when my gut was on the right track... As if I knew I was going in the right direction but fell short many timesIm pretty bummed out right now final in a couple of days but am making an effort to do practice questions appsevolve practice and reading through the rationale. I still feel overwhelmed now with this new information... that is learning HOW to approach the questions on top of trying to review the semesters material. I hope the lightbulb didnt click for me too late I dont know if anything I said helped you but I hope you do well in your final. I saw another comment mentioning seeking out successful classmates my school doesnt allow sharing grades and I understand that many people dont have study groups but if its not too late now or if you have the opportunity seek out some classmates to study with. That may help alleviate some of that anxiety.Good luck! ,StudentNurse,cr79rkw,1,t5_2vqzl

4551501,0,t3_3dbxxe,I agree with everyone recommending the official ATI book I got the package that included the online tests too. Here was my study method.. Take first practice test.. Go through sections of the book in order of worst scoring section to best scoring section I had limited time to study so if I didnt get through everything I wanted to be sure I at least focused on my worst areas.. Take second practice test. Review rationales for what you missed.. Take the two computer practice tests space them out before the exam.. Get good night sleep and good breakfast before actual test.The TEAS is really not that difficult. If she passed her prereqs English is her first language and can do BASIC math it shouldnt be too much trouble. Id hold off on buying the extra books until you take the second practice test. If youre still struggling maybe get another book but its also one of those tests where the best thing to do for your score is just practice taking the test.Good luck!,StudentNurse,ct4c8nj,1,t5_2vqzl

4628385,0,t3_3ed4xy,ABSN or BSN or LPN?  Do you receive study guides for your tests? ADNRN. We didnt really receive study guides. We were given the course syllabus and an outline of the modules.  Instructors rarely provided their power points depended on the professor. Do you ever receive bonus points or extra credit? Bonus points were a very rare occurrence. If there was discrepancy on a quizexam points would be issued back to us  that sort of thing. What is your minimum grade for passing the course?  No rounding up. Do you have a separate Pharmacology course or is it blended in? Had pharm during first semester of nursing school. It was only a  credit course if I remember correctly. How many people started in your program vs how many people are left? What semester are you currently in? Im a graduate licensed ADNRN. About  people started some quit had personal issues that resulted in taking a semester off and some failed along the way. Other people were added to the class people who had failed or taken a semester off would come back and be added to our class. From our original class Id say  made it without any issues. But thats not an exact number. How many hours do you typically study per week? It varied. I dont know exactly.. Between completing course assignments studying Im going to guess anywhere between  hours a week depending on what was going on. Bonus Question What if any tricks have you learned that has helped you do better on testsretaining material? Definitely get an NCLEX book Saunders Comprehensive th Ed. is fantastic..  Dont try to read every chapter wordforword and dont highlight everything. This is where the NCLEX prep book comes in handy it basically breaks down and simplifies all that information in your big text book.  Also do practice NCLEX questions and make sure to focus on the rationales..  Dont assume the exam will be like the lecture. Lectures are basically an overview of the info. It is imperative that you understand NCLEX test taking.. there is a difference in knowing the information in the book VS taking an NCLEXstyle exam. An open book exam would practically be useless because NCLEX requires critical thinking skills.Edit corrections..,StudentNurse,ctdz9hl,2,t5_2vqzl

If Im really strapped for time I will go through my readings and read what is in the boxestables since those are generally important highlights and then go to the end of the chapter and read the key points if book provides them.

L is for Lates it indicates P for placental abruption. This mnemonic makes more sense visually if you write VEAL vertically in the left column and CHOP vertically in the right column.

6647234,0,t3_46mmzq,I had my interview at Dundee for the Adult course but I imagine theyll be quite similar.The emotional test is basically just a list of statements you have to tick your initial reaction to from strongly disagree to strongly agree. No biggie.The mini interviews are actually quite good fun if you can get over the anxiety of the event. Youll probably get one on you who you are and why youre applying. This is your chance to talk yourself up prove and support your statement. So make sure you remember what you wrote.Theres one that gives you a scenario where you meet an old man outside on the street whos lost and confused. What do you do? Theyll adjust the conversation depepending on how you do. Mine ended up adding a head injury so I had to start talking about basic first aid. The third I had was a moral dilemma. Your friend is cheating on a test and you know about it. What do you do? Theyre looking for your moral core here that you understand the NMC code and know that you have an obligation to report this event. But they also want to see if you have a heart so youll obviously try to help your friend as they clearly have some trouble etc.The last one was emotional reactions. Youre given pictures of expressions and asked to match them to a list of words and explain your rationale. Theres no real wrong answer here just try to make sense of your reasons. Then there was a rest station. I interviewed for adult health so it might be a bit different for mental health. Just take your time and think before you speak. Its all over so fast but its not a race. Go and have a pint after and unwind. Youll be awesome. Good luck future nurse. X,StudentNurse,d06vrcz,2,t5_2vqzl

8602101,0,t1_d6guby2,I feel like I could have been successful at the college I started at. A community college was my choice due to the fact that I couldnt continue where I was at because I was dismissed from the program. Like stated I appealed meaning I wrote a letter stating the reason why I think I should be given a second chance but it was denied. Having me make the decision to try again at another school community college. I failed AampP due to procrastinating and making poor decisions as to when I should study.I do feel capable of passing the class this time and Ive learned from my mistakes.If I start community college It is a possibility that I could get accepted into the curriculum im not in nursing school yet im only in prenursing so yes I would have to pass AampP and then a few other classes before being accepted. A little more info This is my very first time as a nursing major.I declared this major in the spring  semester.I had to sign a academic contract due to the fact that I had failed other classes in my other major and had to retake them.The nursing rules states that you can only fail  prerequisite non nursing courses and  prerequisite nursing course.I failed math about  times in my other major. amp then I failed AampP during nursing. which was pretty much my final straw. Which was the reason why I appealed.If I would have stayed at the college I was I would have to change my major.Which is why I chose to go to a community college and continue the path I am on.,StudentNurse,d6guuiy,1,t5_2vqzl

I also followed up with my treatment team to ensure I was stable enough to go.  You could try making a list. I also recommend weighing them. So nursing is job security that would be like a  nursing involves a lot body fluid exposure. Give that a negative value. Add the totals. See if it is more positive or negative and make your decision based on that.You can learn to have an iron stomach with enough exposure.  If it is truly something you dont want dont do it.

9057841,0,t3_54947t,Wow your school has about  less hours in clinical than mine did also in Florida. Interesting to see how things  differ from one place to another. Do you research a place before you appy or do you just send out the generic cover letter you posted? Employers know as a new grad your skills are limited. They want to know are you just applying everywhere or do you really want to be there. If you dont already throw in something that says why you want to work at that particular hospital. Look on their website and incorporate their values into it. Tailor it to each job. Edit The color isnt doing you any good. Employers arent looking for someone who can play with pretty colors. They want someone who can get the job done. As I said above about the cover letter you need to tailor the resume to each posting. You cant just have one resume. Each resume you submit should be related to the job posting. Make sure you have some of the key words in the posting incorporated into the resume for that job. ,StudentNurse,d80lveu,1,t5_2vqzl

Thankfully my classroom dynamic is students who are eager to help each other out. I would hope its the same case for you Were in school to be nurses its in our nature to help each other Can you identify where the problem begins? Are you overthinking the steps?

9318555,0,t1_d8w6xt9,As an ED Tech I spend my day basically cleaning up rooms changing sheets wiping down equipment etc rooming patients and takingcharting vitals doing blood draws getting EKGs and any other random thing the nursesdocs need fitting braces stocking carts etc. Its nice because I get to be involved in just about every interesting thing that goes on since I act as an extra set of hands for the doctors when they do stuff. So when they need to put a temporary splint on a patient that has a deep laceration I would irrigate and dress the wound and then assist them in splinting it. Because of this the experience is almost as good as being an RN in the ED.

Im one semester behind and Im not even graduating with my BSN like I once envisioned. One the other hand the debt is scary. I currently live in Reno NV but Im from the Bay Area. I would love to move back another reason I lean away from the ADN and live with my parents for the first couple years. Nurses there start out at about  an hour from what I understand. It comes out to a little over  per year so from that calculation I would definitely have some wiggle room. Im also graduating in December of  and Ive seen a lot of programs that start in Fall so having those  months to pay off at least a couple thousand in loans would be really nice.Ive noticed that more programs than I thought dont have policies on repeats!

Ok so what I hear you saying is  but my understanding was  was the expectation. or Just so I understand your expectations let me explain to what I think youre asking . Is that correct? and then they can address any miscommunications.  Or It seems like youre really frustrated with me right now but Im not sure what I did.  Ways to kind of point out the emotions that are being expressed identifying when expectations are unclear and therefore communication is super key with someone who is negative and not a great communicator.i hope this helps.  get through it learn as much as you can and honestly if anything youre learning how to deal with bad communicators  there are PLENTY out there  and its especially challenging to deal with when you are caring for patients.And dont forget to gracefully communicate this on evaluations after clinical is complete ,StudentNurse,ddjv2x4,4,t5_2vqzl
10715066,0,t1_ddl5zb4,Dont worry yourself too much about it. When I applied for mine they were very upfront that they dont give a crap if weve done stupid stuff in our past they want us to be good for the future and of course none of the disqualifying offenses. And just because one or two programs near you dont allow you in doesnt mean you cant ever be a nurse. Look at all your options check accreditation and reputations carefully lots of bad nursing schools out there and look out of state. Im sure moving wouldnt be the most ideal thing in the world but if nursing is really what you want and you find a school that will work for you you should go for it.EDIT For your benefit this is the list of disqualifying offenses that my own school uses. Notice that it does include felony theft but that it includes a time limit meaning they do eventually ignore those offenses. It doesnt say it requires a conviction so I dont know but a school administrator could tell you.,StudentNurse,ddl6gw6,1,t5_2vqzl
10717475,0,t3_5t5v9c,Im doing my final semester in a very busy ICU. I was an average ICU student but I feel like I will learn the most there as I can feel like a real nurse and practice the most skills. My second choice was LampD which I would hardly get to do anything except start IVs insert foleys and monitor contractions. Im glad I went with the ICU.

10957020,0,t3_5whqx1,Gonna let you know now that little voice doesnt permanently go away even after graduation. I think its part of what draws nursing students to the profession in the first place  we want to know everything and we want to be sure that were helping our patients. Were also constantly questioned by instructors and encouraged to question ourselves when we practice in order to provide safe and competent patient care. That being said do what works for you. I like to review material regularly like skills or medications talk to other people or dissect an interesting case with my SO. Ive heard other nurses say fake it til you make it  but to add to that I find that it helps to put yourself in a role models shoes. Like your favorite clinical instructor or a stellar nurse you worked with. What would soandso dothink likeprioritize? can help get into the headspace of a successful nurse and therefore you will act like and be a successful nurse. Also in the workplace find your formal and informal clinical learning resources. Attend inservices from all professions if available as well as find coworkers who are knowledgeable and help you towards your learning goals.,StudentNurse,dea503n,13,t5_2vqzl
11004893,0,t1_def8a94,I think if you already had IV access it would probably be more comfortable and have a quicker effect to the patient than a suppository.

11008445,0,t3_5x5r1n,Actually...I would do ICU.  And this isnt because you will have more access to psych patients because you wont not in the same way you would in the ED.  It is because you will have access to interventions illnesses patient scenarios and medications that will help you prepare for the NCLEX.  You will gain incredible assessment skills.  You will be a stronger student for your experience.  Note Im definitely biased.  I  originally wanted to do psych but then I ended up with an ICU internship and now I love it and want to stay here forever.  Not saying this will happen to you though ,StudentNurse,defryot,5,t5_2vqzl

11275904,0,t1_df9yuag,Im also an ICU nurse. Youre not expected to know much. Follow your nurse ask questions.Vents regardless of all the parameters they run on Most alarms are simple actually. Most nursing interventions around the vent add up to checking connections including is there a ETT cuff leak? and suctioning. If those dont work usually the nurse will disconnect the vent and manually bag the patient until RT can fix the vent.Some basic thinking about vent alarms  High Pressure Is the patient coughing? Usually not a concern but suctioning may be needed. What is blocking the tubeairway? Sputum most likely? suction possibly lavage. Is the tubing kinked anywhere? Is the patient biting the tube? Is the pts head in a good position? Did someone leave the inline suction too far in and its blocking the airway?  Low Pressure Is there a leak in the tubing anywhere? Reconnect it. Is there a cuff leak in the trachea? Usually RT will add air but an experienced ICU nurse may add air to cuff.  Low Volume Whats blocking the tube or is there a leak? could be either.  High RR  Is your patient acidotic? Are they anxious? Pain? Are they sedated enough?The is hardly a comprehensive list but this is a common list of problems with vents to show you that most solutions are just practical troubleshooting. ,StudentNurse,dfa3vj1,2,t5_2vqzl

11602733,0,t3_65js5e,Short and round person here! Heres the lowdown for me Honestly I wouldnt worry too much about pant length. Its so much more important to get the waistbuttthigh regions fitting correctly. For me that meant understanding what kind of waistband I need elastic instead of drawstring bonus points for yoga knit style. Also STRETCH is a good keyword when searching if youre bootylicious andor thickthighed like me. Otherwise youll end up needing to go up a size which just means the waist is too loose. If I have to choose between a good fit around vs. length its good fit every time. You can always do a very quick temporary hem as needed. Shoes  fit and cushioning. If you need wide fit shoes for the love of God get wide fit shoes. Im not saying you wouldnt but it happens often enough that I cant not say it. I dont know much about flat feet or PF but if you know what you need to keep them painless for a day of hiking stick to those basics. Maybe talk to your doctor or orthopedist or physical therapist? Aside from that a ton of cushioning is good. Some people go straight to buying Dansko clogs or similar. If you like clogs and have the budget for them go for it. For me running or walking shoes work just fine. I love my Skechers Sport with memory foam. Lightweight great cushion and keep my feet from overheating. Theyre also a decent price for students. Depending on how many clinical days you have you may even want to buy two pairs and rotate them.  I like UniformAdvantage.com aside from a high minimum to get free shipping. They do have some physical stores though. Obviously Amazon is a good goto. Sorry for the novel! I just got so excited that I can finally help with a uniform question rather than being the one asking lol. Im also happy to talk more here on in private. Good luck!,StudentNurse,dgb6gfr,1,t5_2vqzl
