7793961,0,t3_4lbyk5,I think we are probably ready to handle a Tier  raid especially given how fast we completed the last Tier .  Ive personally gone from  characters that I could use to  characters just in the past  and a half weeks.  During our last attempt we were getting about  a phase per day.  If our strength as a guild has at least doubled then we shouldnt have any problems completing it in under  days.  Everyone just would need to be aware that it is going to be slightly painful but with that pain comes a lot of rewards ,FrozenInCarbonite,d3s3lc7,1,t5_3ecmw
