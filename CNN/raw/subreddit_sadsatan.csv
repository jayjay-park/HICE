4551161,0,t1_ct4a8y0,I just had a major breakthrough and I think you are right about all of this. My problem has always been chasing the details thinking it will lead me to the big picture. I think we are at a dead end because this game has got us so focused now on the details that we are losing sight of what its for. I think I know what its for now and if Im right we should be focusing more on that question than discovering that Franz Joseph married a child Sisi instead of her adult sister that Franz was intended to marry or that Franz Josephs Wikipedia page top picture strongly resembles the drawing of the king in Disneys Cinderella. I mean all of that stuff is pretty interesting but it probably really is coincidence. I watched PI last night and it was very therapeutic for me and helped me a lot. I also think I finally understand the difference between being a numerologist and a mathemagician though Im probably wrongheaded to think so.,sadsatan,ct4apbt,1,t5_38wu2

4858942,0,t1_cu0vysz,What worries me is that kidsll start seeing some sort of allure in the deep web and might try accessing it just so they can find something to be Sad Satans successor. Except they wont find anything remotely close just buckets and buckets of vomit inducing cp and gore.Ive been to the deep web quite sparingly in my life and I spent the entirety of my time there terrified that someone was going to exploit any vulnerability they could find in my system or moreover that they were going to try hacking my webcam to exploit ME as a young woman I do believe the deep web isnt necessarily a very good place for females to be to the point of where I had to just quit sit down and breathe. as someone who enjoys things like blood guts and horror. I consider myself a pretty strong person but even I am disturbed by the sheer outright display of depravity on the deep web the fact that deviants hide behind seven proxies with no shame or remorse for what theyre doing and that i cant do anything to stop them from committing heinous acts over and over and over. It just makes me angry for lack of a better word. I dont want kids stumbling upon any of that corrupt filth since the deep web is chock far fuller more of that than content that much piques my interest. Id rather look for banned books on the surface if it means not running into weirdos left and right.Kids are ballsy young teens anyway theyd have no idea what theyd be getting into going on the deep web and randomly click on whatever seems to pique their interest. That could lead to potentially catastrophic consequences if not for their hard drive or their computer when the hacker is done with them but the charges that can be racked up against them for even stumbling upon things like cp. not to mention the psychological repercussions one faces after going on the deep web and coming upon something unsavory imagine this hoard of kids doing that multiple times its just not good. Not good at all. Not a good scenario.,sadsatan,cu70842,6,t5_38wu2
4861651,0,t1_cu72vwd,Im using the Terror Engine to make the game as I wanted to be as authentic as possible. If you are thinking about learning Terror Engine Id say go for it as it only took me about an hour to learn it and reprogramming features. but thats kinda my job so I dont know how long itll take youIf you want to use Unity go ahead I havent taken the time to getlearn it because Ive never done a serious project with it and the one time I did try to get it to see whats its like to use something happened with the download so I didnt bother to try again make sure that if you can add a pixelation and edge detection effect. The pixelation adds the disorderly effect the edge detection makes it edgy and black and white and make the FOV very small. also make sure the only source of light for black and white sections as OHC used outdoor segments too is a lantern to replicate the need to explore in order to see walls.Hope this helps this is what Ive learned so far from looking at the clones code and making the remake keep in mind its only been  days since Ive started and  days since Ive discovered Sad Satan,sadsatan,cu7cjab,2,t5_38wu2
5036401,0,t3_3jrt7t,Like uwhitenoiz said something will most likely come up in the future.Someone could find something else about the images audio etc more youtubers could play it andor another remake comes out OHC or the clone creator could do something else with the game the list goes on...Well just see what happens first I guess ,sadsatan,cut2t80,1,t5_38wu2
