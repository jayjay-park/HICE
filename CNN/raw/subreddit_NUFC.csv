But as most people here have said its nonsense.I kind of blame UEFA and FA for whats happened to the Premier League. With the energy and time absorbing Europa League now clearly having a negative affect on teams whats the incentive for us to push on in the league or cup competitions? Champions League football? We dont have the squad or money unfortunately and if we went for it this transfer window bought a bunch of players and didnt make the CL  wed fall back into the Europa and it would be last season all over again.

Directly your statement that most of the money is reinvested is just WRONG.  Come on lets see your ego find an answer to your lack of logic there. And you STILL havent addressed the fact that our commercial revenue is being siphoned off to Sports Direct. I think your ego is so big that you will ignore anything that contradicts your certainty that you are right. I dont have that problem. Ive readily agreed with you when you are. SO let me be clear if most our our transfer income is being reinvested then how come the club is making substantial profits of transfers every season?

634742,0,t1_cgced0z,gtI was willing to bet that we would sign at least one player for the starting  and made that clear several times you claimed that we wont but didnt have the resolve to back what you said.Check the very first comment on this comment tree. It wasnt even me either!gtI bet we sign  first team quality players.The likes of sammy are already placed in the first team and the likelihood is well see him more and more next season for him to cement a place in our squad I dont really view him as a quality player. I highly doubt well be spending any significant money to find replacements or fill in positions and the reason like I said before is because of how expensive spending in this summers window will be with the WC. Quality would be someone of equal or greater ability than a player they are replacing. You bring up starting  but when I ask you wouldnt even name who you thought they were because to be honest Id definitely put Williamson ahead of Mapou I probably wouldnt even start Santon.gtYoure supposed to be a supporter of the club fucking act like it.Yep Ill just turn up shut up and feast on the shitfest we have been shoveled and in  years time I will say. Boy that Pardew was a good lad we finished th  years ago!. Ill pretend like all the decisions in the past few years have been brilliant and Ill constantly boast how good our scouting is because we got players like... Cabaye? for cheap and we havent wasted ANY money on flops like Marveux Amalfitano Obertan. Its not like its taken us to start playing Anita in a way he can be played hes a total short arse and for the majority of games he played prior to this season the ball was mostly inIm a fan life long but Im fucking sick of seeing us getting absolutely fucking raped at home and people just brushing it off as if its nothing or just a blip a series of events leads to these sort of performances. You can see how bad it is when Cisse scores one goal in I have no idea how many games it is now since he last scored a goal in open play and starting asking whether this will give him confidence. Were clutching at straws when it comes to our squad as far as I see it were relying on other teams being shit rather than actually putting any consistent performances. The fact is the season finished in January we have absolutely nothing to play for other than final cash rewards but that doesnt really reward the fans. No intention to play in any of the cups blame the europa league but want to be top table? So our aim seems to be be at least th but dont push for european qualification. As a fan Im not happy.,NUFC,cgcf5iz,1,t5_2s6ya
691753,0,t3_220ha7, Moyes doesnt seem like he is up for the job of managing such a big club and the fact he inherited a prem winning  team doesnt matter. I feel like Ferguson didnt care about Man U after he left so he didnt prepare the team for  after he left. That mixed with some bad transfer windows has left Man U in bad shape. As seemingly everyone else on the internet I love Kagawa but I worry for him more now you bought Mata. He could be a starting player at most other Champions league teams but yet he chooses to stay at Man U. I like Welbeck too he has a chance to become very great.Honestly there isnt anyone else I like at Man U I feel like you have mostly unlikable players.  It might sound silly to blame it all on the departure of Cabaye but its obvious now that the entire team was built around him and not getting a replacement killed the ambition for the season. It also doesnt help that Remy is our only reliable goalscorer and he isnt even a Newcastle player. I blame the lack of consistency more on European football then anything else. Look at other teams like Swansea and its clear to see that you need a good large squad to compete in both the prem and Europe. But Europa league money just isnt good enough to fund that. I do feel Pardew isnt the man for where I want the club to be but he is for where Ashley wants to be. Only two things would give Newcastle a chance to legitimately challenge the top  spots.The first is money the current chairman is happy with getting the money out he put in to save the club from debt. Once that debt is paid Newcastle would surely be one of the next clubs in the league that would be bought by people with silly amounts of money. Im not too sure if Id be happy with this though.The second is to have a class of  esque golden generation of players. Although the current teams emphasis on buying cheap foreign talent instead of growing talent stops this instantly. Id at least like to see some young English players break into the first team. Although from what I have heard the Newcastle youth system is one of the worst around. Its only really the fans that annoy me. Chelsea fans act like they deserved the money Man city fans tend to be more honest about the clubs luck. I want Liverpool to win it but I wouldnt mind Man city to win it too. Man U and Newcastles positions wont change. As it stands Bayern have the advantage. But as shown Man u stand a chance if they score more. I think conceding against Bayern is an certain. unless something major changes in Newcastle its a win for Man U.,NUFC,cgiwkay,2,t5_2s6ya
692227,0,t3_220ha7, I like David moyes hes a good manager but he hasnt really been tested with Everton he didnt really set the world alight apart from Europe. I feel for moyes I really do. Hes inherited a very poor squad I think fergie knew it was coming to an end and was right to get out while he did. For some reason a lot of people love to see united fail I guess its part jealousy as theyve been the dominant force for nearly  years I on the other hand like to rib my mates about it Man U supporters but really Ive always admired their squad after all most of them are or have been England internationals. I think moyes will still be there at the end of the season give him time to rebuild in the summer and see how he performs then. I wouldnt say dislike. I think theres a lot of players that are no longer good enough or never have been. The old players Ferdinand Vidic Giggs They are pretty much past it now cant really keep up with the pace the premiership demands Giggs can still do a job but I doubt hed get in a top four club at present. Welbeck is still young so hes got time to improve but I dont think hes good enough to play for United. Young is absolute tosh I wouldnt even want him playing for us! The stand out players for me are De Gea I think hes an awesome goalkeeper Rooney hes a workhorse always tracks back and gets the team in scoring positions hes the best player in the squad IMO. Rafael is another player I admire against liverpool he seemed the only player up for it! Always good to see a bit of passion.  The sale of Yohan Cabaye hit us hard he was the heart of the team has been for a long long time. Not only can he see a pass he scored goals as well. By not replacing him with an equal MFA basically put an end to our season. Remy is another factor when he plays we score and we mostly win hes been injured quite a bit and lets not forget the stupid suspension. Ill be sad to see him go.  I dont think pardew is right for the job but then I think to myself who would be? He has some poor tactics sometimes but he has to work with what hes got unfortunately for us MFA doesnt seem to want to spend any money on good players it worked out a few times for him cabaye demba so he thinks he can pick a gem from the dirt but unfortunately good players command good money which we dont have or more MFA doesnt want to spend it. A good manager a lot of money patience and to stop selling our best players. Number  is the most important if we didnt sell Demba if we didnt sell andy Carroll and if we didnt sell Cabaye we could of easily been a top  team thats what I believe anyway. You dont see any of the most successful teams selling their best players so there must be a colleration somewhere there. Yes and No I like Chelsea because they have some great players and they now have a great manager but I hate the owner. Despise Manchester City they are the pinnacle of everything wrong about football these days too much money to compete with and ridiculous wages to contend with teams like this break up harmony in smaller successful clubs if they want a player they pay over the odds if they have competition they pay absurd wages. I dont know where it went wrong really. Id like to see Liverpool win the league god knows they deserve to. Theyve been entertaining this season and its nice to see a different team at the top once in a while having said that I think Chelsea will eventually be the winners. I think we will both stay in the position we are in currently. I didnt give you a chance on Tuesday night and I was very surprised when you went  up but it should of been  at that point. On current form Id say no Bayern will probably win  but United always seem to have luck on their side in big games and anything can happen so lets hope! I always support the english sides in Europe apart from Man City. and underand! If Remy is playing Id like to think wed give it a go and we are more than capable of beating you but if he isnt playing we dont score and if you dont score you dont win matches unless its a draw but I cant see Rooney not getting at least one.,NUFC,cgiyi67,1,t5_2s6ya

1408006,0,t3_2a91lj,He likes his runs behind the back line so the opposite of Giroud who comes short and brings your midfield into play. Very direct great at counter attacking decent finisher quick as balls good at anticipating balls in the box likes to cut inside if you play him wide.However hes incredibly greedy. He just gets tunnel vision and tries to go alone too much. Could be because the entire time we had him he was using as a shop window but if not its a massive contradiction of Arsenals style. When hes wide hell always come inside but if you force him wide he cant cross. Hes poor defensively too and offside a fair bit but I cant think of any other major weaknesses.He wasnt bad centrally or anything played there pretty much all year only shifting out wide when we were on our losing streak and throwing everything at it but only for a few games. Hes definitely much better through the middle as the main striker.Personally I wouldve thought hed be a horrible fit for Arsenal. Maybe as a plan B for Giroud because he offers something so completely different but for an incredibly indirect possession based passing side he seems like a weird choice. But he really is an amazing player and we only won one game without him.,NUFC,cisrucb,2,t5_2s6ya

1694976,0,t3_2dt79d,I thought every new player contributedColback was excellent neat and careful passing and harassed their players. He will be a good signing. Unbelievably he played at least  good dead balls one of which Dummett contrived to spoon over the bar when it was easier to score. Janmaat looked very much like Debuchy did when he started. Slightly out of sync but careful defending one excellent tackle in the box. Looking for him to settle in. Rivire was given virtually nothing to feed on and his halfchances betrayed nervousness. But for someone who is quite fast and not a big lad I thought he looked promising. He fought to hold the ball up against their countless thugs and acquired himself ok. More to come. Cabella is far from a shy bairn and is full of stepovers. He danced around their players several times and I thought looked extremely promising. I fancy that he will be a big hit just lacks that bit of pace. Aarons and Perez werent on for long but should be a step up from the dross coming out of the academy recently. It is crap not scoring or getting a point on the opening day but I am cautiously optimistic. The only caveat is that we will need a hell of a lot of coaching and training ground work and Im not sure Pardew is good enough to do that. Well I know hes not just trying to be upbeat. ,NUFC,cjstcyg,4,t5_2s6ya
1700769,0,t3_2dutz1,Krul  . Looked a lot more confident than he did last season especially dealing with corners and he seems to have worked on his distribution over preseason. Will be disappointed with both goals  one through his legs and shouldve parried Agueros initial shot further away  but you cant blame him too much.  Janmaat  . Played a little too narrow for my liking and wasnt helped by Gouffran as much as you expect. Was happy to hold his ground and stay on his feet where Debuchy or Simpson wouldve dived in to the tackle. I cant remember him ever sprinting even when they were countering. Seemed to panic every time he got the ball in an attacking position.  Coloccini  . Seems to have improved on the end of last season but hes nothing like he used to be. Made a couple of good blocks but was at fault for both goals.  Williamson  . Did what you expect of him. Made some tackles won some headers looks for an easy pass if possible and if not hoof it.  Dummett  . Too scared to go into tackles that he was likely to win on multiple occasions. If someone made a good pass for him to run onto he wouldnt bother. If Clichy can leave him for dead imagine what Navas couldve done. Pathetic performance and not fit for the shirt.  Colback  . Gave a very tidy performance winning the ball back and moving it on well. Lacks the strength or work rate of Tiote but is more disciplined.  Anita  . Pretty much the same as Colback but not quite as good and didnt get forward as much.  Gouffran  . He didnt track back as much as he usually does which is a shame as hes pretty good at it leaving Kolarov in acres of space on numerous ocassions. Didnt really catch the eye going forward. Had a chance from a corner but needed to take it first time.  Sissoko  . Looked very threatening running at the defence but no end product because he didnt know where the support was. Hopefully thats just because the new signings havent bedded in yet. Didnt notice him do much defensively.  Cabella  . Our only real creative spark. Looked very good going forward but also won some tackles and looked like a team player as well.  Riviere  . Didnt have much support but didnt do much either. Made one good run holding off  of their players. A better option than Cisse and could be good given time but Id rather go with Ferreyra or Perez next week. Didnt put pressure on the keeper or CBs when they had the ball.Obertan  . Came on and didnt really do much. Went in for a few tackles that he previously wouldnt have bothered with and Perez had a chance to put him oneonone but passed to Cabella instead. Could be a useful player but will never be a key player.  Perez  . Came off the bench and nearly won us a point on his own. Looks good technically but might need to bulk up a little.  Aarons  . OK so its his senior debut against one of the best teams in the world and hes clearly extremely talented but that was awful. Hopefully this wont make Pardew drop him to the reserves or Scotland for the season.One of my main criticisms of the team under Pardew even when were doing well is that we give the ball away cheaply and frequently and that the players dont seem to care too much. I was very happy with how we played yesterday especially against City.I noticed we were sitting deep in defence and letting them come at us. On the whole this worked very well but there were a few times where DzekoJovetic were up on their own holding the ball up surrounded by  of our players and noone closed them down.,NUFC,cjtjlzb,2,t5_2s6ya

1801210,0,t3_2f5wac,I appreciate your optimism but the fact of the matter is that midtable shouldnt be an aim. Theres a reason why we have a relatively young squad  high sell off value. Imagine we do get th place this season and lets say SDJ and Cabella do well theyll more than likely be sold next summer then the cycle repeats itself with other youngsters. My main problem is the fact that we aim to just stay in the premier league and sell our best players because we have no ambition. We play quite negative football and we havent improved upon the areas we needed which should have been implored at the start of the transfer window. ,NUFC,ck674vp,3,t5_2s6ya

If you invest invest in the team and you start competing at a high level you are going to be more profitable than you ever would be otherwise.Seriously if NUFC was at the top of the league for a few years not even winning outright just being competitive going to Europe etc their name recognition would go through the roof. More people would become fans. And that means more merchandise sold more people scrambling for tickets more people saying to their friends Hey have you seen this team? How do these businessmen not see that investing in the team and making them good will return their investment way more than midtable mediocrity ever would.Also youre not always going to hit where you aim so AIMING for midtable means youll have seasons like this one where youre threatened with relegation.

4127579,0,t3_37y139,The article states weve pulled out of Mitrovic due to wanting to improve the character of the squad and he doesnt fit the new approach. For me the character of the squad is mainly down to the manager and how he operates. Even the biggest characters or complete bellends in football can fit into a team if managed properly. So how can we implement a new approach without a fucking manager. I assume that perhaps the strong links with Veira is in fact a signal that we are indeed looking to get a strong respected manager who can mold a strong team. Or perhaps were looking at someone with a strong philosophy to build a team Laudrup and his style or Garde with his successful youth team stint at Lyon.A new approach to change a teams character and identity will never happen with a McClaren or Carver at the helm. ,NUFC,crqrob4,6,t5_2s6ya

He has to play. Which means we have to pick between Sissoko and Colback for the number  spot seeing as neither can anchor a defence.Colback keeps us ticking over in that he doesnt lose the ball much. If all you require from your midfielders is to not be a liability in possession then thats fine.Cabella played  in Ligue  but doesnt look comfortable there in the PL. He likes to run with the ball and cant find the space to do it in the middle in this league. If you look at his heatmaps he always drifts wide in search of space anyway when hes played as a .

Sunderland and Aston Villa seem much more disciplined and organised than they were previously and they have been performing better. Similarly  Liverpool have been flying under Klopp after performing pretty below par when Rodgers was still at the helm. We wont perform until we follow suite and get a new manager who can at least breathe some life back into the players organise the team and get them wanting to play once again. Once you lose the dressing room like McClaren has there its almost impossible to turn things around. Honestly the fact that there isnt really that much pressure on him is baffling to me. Hes been as bad as Carver was with M worth of additional players.

If that extra time itself was timed the crowd would be pissed off when the referee inevitably cuts it short or extends it.  I always think it would be good  now we have the technology.

9055220,0,t1_d809jua,Correlation is not causation. Just because Spurs can get more money in sponsorship in  than Newcastle in  even from the same baseline does not mean it is due to Newcastles owner or the owners ownership elsewhere.Tottenham have been in European football every season since . Apart from one season they have been in the top  in the premier league since .In that same  year period since  Newcastle have been relegated twice in Europe twice and only been in the top  twice.It may be a crude measure but Spurs have almost twice as many Twitter followers than Newcastle too.So which shirt would you rather have your company name on the front of between the two? Spurs are going to get you far much more exposure. I say this even as a Newcastle fan.Yes maybe Newcastle should have done better in the league. But having a rich owner even one with extremely deep pockets so obviously not Ashley does not guarantee the team will do well and therefore be able to charge more for sponsorship.And as an aside. Newcastles owner is using the club to promote his other business. If Sports Direct was actually paying for that coverage all over the stadium itd be a massive increase in revenue. But Mike Ashley clearly decided to use that space to promote his own business rather than charge somebody else for the space. And hes a better businessman than me so Im sure he did his sums before making that decision.,NUFC,d80ajud,1,t5_2s6ya

SO somehow Janmaat has a better overall complete perecentage than Sissoko I cant find Sissoko passing to Janmaat on the list The n appears to the onetwo pass of JanmaatgtSissokogtback to Janmaat not the individual pairs. Without data on total number of passes JanmaatgtSissoko and SissokogtJanmaat we cant really tell who was better or worse. Ultimately in raw numbers this data is almost meaningless. Its annoying as it seemed interesting at first glance. Edit After reading usammyarmy s post all the data is twopass sequences so not quite as I thought.

Charles NZogbia even followed Given out the door towards Wigan Athletic of all clubs  the ultimate insult to Newcastle fans.gtRelegation followed.gtWithin  months star striker and homegrown talent Andy Carroll had been sold to Liverpool  admittedly for an astonishing m  as Ashley once again showed a lack of ambition.gtIn the next few January windows that followed United sold Demba Ba to Benitezs Chelsea for m in  Yohan Cabaye to Paris SaintGermain for m and Hatem Ben Arfa on a free to Nice.gtYear after year Newcastle fans dreaded losing their best players during the midseason window as clubs offered inflated January prices for Uniteds prize assets.gtTrue the Magpies recruited Andros Townsend and Jonjo Shelvey for a collective m at the beginning of  and did not allow anyone to leave but the proven Premier League striker and centreback they so desperately needed did not arrive.gtSeydou Doumbias loan spell proved to be a disaster too.gtBut this January window will be oh so different.gtIn  its all about incomings and not outgoings.gtOn Friday Benitez made it clear that he is not interested in selling anyone.gtAleksandar Mitrovic has been linked with a host of topflight sides but Benitez even made the unusual move of namechecking the gameshy Serbian as one of the players he is desperate to keep hold of.gtJamaal Lascelles and Paul Dummett will also remain on Tyneside unless a Premier League club really is willing to break the bank for either of them.gtInstead Benitezs focus in on recruiting another midfielder and a winger to reduce the creative burden on Jonjo Shelveys shoulders something which was made to look all the more pressing following the directionless display against Sheffield Wednesday.gtRuben LoftusCheek Robert Snodgrass and Fabian Delph are just three players United are looking at while they have put in a number of enquiries about taking Premier League players on loan too.gtInstead of agonising for too long over Boxing Days shock defeat Newcastle fans should actually be relieved as New Years Day fast approaches.gtFor once they look set for a positive January window rather than the firesales they have unfortunately become accustomed to during the Ashley era. ,NUFC,dbpilc8,13,t5_2s6ya
