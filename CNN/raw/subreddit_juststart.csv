6250472,0,t3_413d6c,Good score on grabbing . I know it may feel like shambles but reddit traffic is notoriously difficult to monetize. The average user is lowincome savvy males aged in their midtwenties. The first taste is the best. Its like a holy crap its not just a myth... I did this myself! Its an awesome feeling.If I had a dollar for every drone site I saw pop up in the last few months I would be rich. High value items that are constantly in the media. It is a license to make bank but it draws the competition too. IMO if you were not going to physically review the drones yourself then it was a good time to get out. You cant begrudge the new owner for making money. He bought the site with the intention to make back his investment  more. Dont dwell on it push on with your other sites. This is something I had to recently overcome because my sites grow month on month the owners are always going to earn more back than I am getting for the site and in my head it is a fool proof investment. But you have to remember to them it is a huge risk on their part and in reality any site can tank at any time.Heres to your success in !Also interesting tidbit.. I always find it is near  amazon items shipped vs rd party items shipped and your earnings report was very similar. ,juststart,cz040m8,3,t5_3bvyi

6291039,0,t1_cz4o4m9,I completely agree. My overarching goal when I started this particular hobby was first to learn how to create a website that people wanted to visit and if it makes money all the better. I love learning new topics and figuring how to make things and making affiliate sites has that in spades.My first couple sites were real stinkers and after a short amount of time I could clearly tell that. I made a couple spammy sites using ClickBank and a couple poorly chosen high competitive sites after that. The topics were too broad and ranking them was way above my skill level.After reading the case study by uhumblesalesman I started following his suggestions and have seen limited success. I made one site that gets me about  a month but is very limited in scope and I dont see much room for growth. Its an exact match domain that sells one specific guide to one specific MMORPG game.I then made my most recent site and I have lots of great I hope ideas for it. Whether or not it ultimately succeeds monetarily isnt that big a deal to me I will have learned a great deal from the process. What I am really looking for is a rough metric on when I should take that new knowledge and apply it into a new site giving the new site the bulk of my time.Ideally this site will be a monetary success and as soon as its financially feasible I can start learning the automatedVA side of things.If its not that successful though.... knowing when to cut my losses is also something I would like to learn. Money isnt my big goal but it is a great metric to measure the site by.Im not sure I am properly communicating the distinction Im trying to make. My end goal is the knowledge of how to make money with affiliate marketing. I cant tell if I am on the right track and actually gaining that knowledge unless I start making sites that make money. If I continue on with a site that will never make any decent money how do I know I am getting the right knowledge?When do you determine for yourself that you need to move on and refocus your efforts on a new site?,juststart,cz4py14,4,t5_3bvyi

6339124,0,t1_cz9k7m4,Ok so I dug around a little bit and think I figured out what you are saying.  Lets see if I understand this.I find a product or service on clickbank I want to promote.  Lets call it spammyspamspam.  I then buy a domain I want to use that relates to spam.  Lets call it theultimatespamguide.com.  I then install it on wordpress and get a plug in for affiliate cloaking.  I cloak my hoplink to make it look something like theultimatespamguide.comebook.  Then I start a Facebook ad campaign and anytime somebody clicks on theultimatespamguide.comebook they will automatically go to my hoplink and I will make sales.

6383680,0,t1_czf7ds6,Thats exactly the plan right there.  One thing I forgot to mention was how my perception changed since last year as well.  When I talked about the competition I was looking at I didnt know what I was looking for then.  Now I see who I am actually competing with and how I can do head to head with them.  Theres one site that is on the first page of every keyword we share.  Hes doing  views a month and his site is not great.  Not bad either but his pictures are nothing special and his content is nothing special.  He is giving the information people are looking for and thats it.Im not knocking him but I am already beating him in the rankings with  of my posts.  He also does barely any promoting and has almost no backlinks.  His views are  google search and about  direct.  He doesnt have any way on the site for people to share the content.  And I think the  of us can collaborate.  I have a bunch of infographics that I will offer to share with him to share on his social feeds with the stipulation that he give me a shout out.  Anyway my plan is to get the site rolling and then just dedicate one day a week to it as you said while I work on another site.,juststart,czf9806,1,t5_3bvyi

6900252,0,t1_d0xxm5o,Thanks for the reply Wizz. I do go through and check all the negative reviews too I should have clarified better. For each level star to star I read all the ones rated helpful by other people. I also try to softly explain these widget hiccups in my pros and cons section and say why a lot of them are avoidable or fixable. In fact I got that tip from you in a previous comment you gave way back when somewhere. Question  do you ever just go nuclear on a widget review saying the widget sucks entirely and direct them to other widget reviews? Some of mine have a decent number of reviews but for example if one has  reviews and a . star rating its hard to spin in a positive light. Social media honestly intimidates me so that definitely means I need to address it. I just need to figure out how to make my widget reviews sound engaging enough to garner clicks on the right platform.,juststart,d0ygnb8,2,t5_3bvyi

9041981,0,t3_543lpi,I cant see the website but general tips would be to build an email list and start blogging. I am a firm believer of providing value before a sale.If you build a brand and a network then you will make a whole lot more than k. I would start writing guides and insightful advice maybe do some QampAs. After you have build a relationship with your audience they will be more likely to convert and you will have better data on what type of customer to target. Also I wouldnt shy away from social media. There are some untapped popular platforms that with the right strategy can attract a lot of customers. I dont know what your target demo is but I would imagine it is older professionals. Even though IMO Snapchat is a money faucet for the internetmarketer it doesnt have your target demo. Facebook on the other hand has aged and allows great targeting. You could start by promoting on Facebook. Since you are beginning and the ebook market is tough one to crack especially for older demographics I would do the following.  Provide Value webinars QampA insightful posts first chapter free create a brand around you as a person Play the long game Dont try to sell immediately create a relationship become an expert in your field Untapped media Advertise also on places where your competition is not advertising. For example go for print and provide a meetup or something. Build an EMail list from day one. This is your greatest source of income especially with older professionals who have higher open rates than younger people.  Dont only go for kindle. Try to sell direct to your customer. ,juststart,d7yp9ry,2,t5_3bvyi
9111766,0,t3_54xw13,I think theres a kernel of truth thereyou can create a great site and get visitors only through social media and PPC. Plenty of people do it.

Formatting a post correctly and having it indexed quickly and accurately will always be important because no matter WHAT your site is youll want to get search engine trafficeven if its a small portion of the visitors to your site. ,juststart,d8734sb,1,t5_3bvyi
9139519,0,t3_55h1u9,Ive personally tried writing content for more than one site at a time and found that it was pretty hard.Having ideas is great but the grind is the real deal. If you havent started yet you cant know how much of a pain in the ass it is to write more and more quality content for a single website.I think you should write your ideas down in a nice doc and let them stay there. If you havent even started yet  of those ideas might be trash. You never know until you do the full keyword and competition research.As to how long you should wait before starting another website that is something very specific to the website youre making and to your personnal preferences. Some people like to stick to a niche and cover it on all its details and some prefer to cover the major keywords then move on to another. Both can work.As I said if youre in the content writing period for multiple websites at a time youll find that its very hard. Writing for one niche is hard enough already if you dont outsource.So overall I think right now you should be focussing on doing the full research for one niche and start writing content for it. The more you advance with this website the more youll learn. If at one point you think that youve covered all the necessary keywords for you site to be successful then you might move on to another niche.,juststart,d8ai0pb,1,t5_3bvyi

I only made a fraction of that with my site.I reinvested  of the money back into my business ventures and its really paying off. I highly recommend doing that if its possible. I think I saw uWZZRD mention that not too long ago. Shit moves fast when you do.Good ideas on the YouTube thing. Im ok with temporary nonorganic traffic as long as it drives sales. Plus I gain my own followers along the way which can be further marketed to. I just need to figure out how to attract buyers with this method.My writer either has the product borrows it or goes out to a store and checks it out. I suppose I could look into the unboxing videos but Im not sure it would work well in my niche. Of course that could very well be my prejudice talking because I think unboxing videos are dumb.Thanks for the ideas!,juststart,dd7a7fm,2,t5_3bvyi

Im in a mastermind group with some other website owners one guy who use Amazon affiliate to monetize his sites also got a scheduled for a call from Amazon for the same reason. They didnt call them yet but he did say that its about the commision rate change.  But for the same reason you could say that Im or hes lying or whatever.

10892298,0,t3_5vlh91,I reached out to a nicherelated product manufacturer who has an ecommerce presence and asked them if they had an affiliate program. Depending on what niche youre in they might not even know what this is which is what happened. The first company I reached out to werent interested.When I reached out to a second company different product same niche I was very clear about what I meant by affiliate program I would earn a  of sales generated and provided my monthly traffic stats which were pretty substantial and very targeted to their product.They were immediately interested but didnt have an affiliate program that used cookies and were hesitant to set one up. As an alternative they provided me with a coupon code and a for deal on their specific product. Now whenever someone buys using this coupon code I get a  commission on the sale.Like uBOOGYDOG said you dont know what you dont know  so find out.If they dont have an affiliate program there might be ways around it that work just the same. Plus an email doesnt hurt and a no now doesnt mean itll be a no in a years time when youve got more traffic. At least if they say no because you dont have enough traffic you wont be emailing cold next time.,juststart,de3goth,7,t5_3bvyi
10892983,0,t1_de3goth,The two of you have shared some very interesting thoughts and suggestions that show me there are more than a few options available for me to offer value to these retailers. Speaking of the fact that you arranged a relationship with the company wherein which you earned revenue and they tracked your contribution to their bottomline by giving you a coupon code actually opens a potential avenue for me to gain brand exposure and consumer trust by offering a very direct form of value. I agree with you both in that you dont know what you dont know and that no now doesnt mean anything about the future but I can clearly see that if I incorporate these suggestions into my business plan I need to be clear with my desired outcome and the benefits I can provide when I first introduce myself to these companies.Thanks for your advice and thoughts. Im glad that somewhere out there are other people who have a mind to actively improve their situation while also being willing to help improve someone elses. ,juststart,de3j8bj,1,t5_3bvyi
