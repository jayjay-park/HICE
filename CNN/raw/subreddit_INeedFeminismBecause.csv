337436,0,t1_cdqz6nq,I think the point is that many women for example Rihanna are criticized for staying in an abusive relationship because people dont realize how difficult it is to leave. Its not helpful to her or anybody to criticize her and say shes a terrible role model because she stayed in an abusive relationship. Early in the relationship when people saw the warning signs they could have said Hey this guys a nut job. You should stay away from him. And that argument can still be made she should have stayed the holy fuck away from Chris Brown. But to say Well just leave! is to completely misunderstand the situation shes in. If it were that easy she would have. But hes emotionally manipulative and she is probably really afraid of the violence he may inflict on her if she tries to leave. I cant remember the exact statistics for it but I know a lot more domestic violence murders occur once the victim has left the relationship. Even if she were to leave she would be in danger probably more than if she stayed. So asking her why doesnt she just leave him? is very ignorant and ignorance about domestic violence is a problem. ,INeedFeminismBecause,cffqulj,1,t5_2whtf

395934,0,t1_cflsvwz,I didnt say it was a Ponzi scheme I said it was similar.gt In a Ponzi scheme the investors are entirely unaware of the scam.Most literature majors are also entirely unaware of the scam until they try to find a job.  Their choices are then twofold  accept the loss of their investment or  try to find new investors i.e. students to bring into the scam.gt...the incentive for a Ponzi scheme is return on investment.Just as it is for a literature degree except the expected return on such a degree is not purely financial.,INeedFeminismBecause,cflsz4w,7,t5_2whtf
