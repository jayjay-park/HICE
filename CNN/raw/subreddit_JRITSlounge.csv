2534610,0,t1_cmocn51,I dealt with a diagnosis like that last week. Idling rough told the customers to start with the throttle body then retest since its throwing out codes for the air and fuel injectors. Which turns into me arguing with the customers whose grasp of English is shaky about why it needs to retest along with the daughter and her boyfriend. This wasnt just one day it was over the entire week.,JRITSlounge,cmperov,2,t5_2xd8j
