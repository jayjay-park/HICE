401305,0,t3_1yo4i0,I dont think the problem is with the bolt you could always switch bolts with your brother just to check.  It sounds like you brothers ejector assembly has an issue. With the bolt pulled back look for a flat piece of metal sticking out of the inside of the receiver.  It is spring loaded you can push it into the receiver and it should pop back out.  This is the ejector notice that a channel in the bolt slides over it.  This is the piece that forces the cartridge off of the bolt and out of the receiver.  I would guess that your brothers ejector is either missing has the tab broken off has a broken spring or is dirtyjammed into the receiver so that it isnt sticking out far enough.  Since you have a rifle with a working ejector compare the two and try to determine the root cause.  Im referring to part  here    ,MosinNagant,cfmd094,2,t5_2rpia

After shooting spray it in the chamber liberally before leaving so that it runs out of the end of the barrel and clean as soon as you get home. Makes sure you clean the bolt as well. The surplus ammo can be hell on that as much as the barrel. The will be cosmoline EVERYWHERE. expect for it to seep out of the barrel bands for the first few times you shoot it unless you fully disassemble and clean. Cleaning thoroughly before you shoot it. Some clp aught to do the trick. Take the bolt completely apart including removing the firing pin and give it a good clean and oil. Take off the mag spring on the bottom as well and give it a good cleaning. Use a tooth brush for those hard to reach places. Get a . bore snake. Have fun!

3176104,0,t1_cor5wqj,Finnish capture generally refers to rifles manufactured in the Soviet Union and captured from same during the Winter War and Continuation War.

The Finns mixed parts from many different manufacturers when rebuilding these rifles.The Finns generally didnt scrub the manufacturers markings off of rifles they captured. Also this isnt a Soviet receiver you can see the Imperial EagleoverPK proof commission stamp on the upper flat surface of the receiver ring which shows this receiver was made under the Czar. The OEWG stamp just above that is AustroHungarian arms depot Ostereichische Waffenfabrik Gesellschaft at Steyr Austria indicating the rifle was captured by AustriaHungary during WW and went through an inspection or refurbishment at that facility.

The Classic batch appears to have been sent to Romania after the war in one of the pics you can see Instructie stamped on a stock so they missed the most recent Soviet refurbishment process. The JampG ones are probably more the standard ones that came from the former Soviet Union so they have been aresenalrefurbished. They will be prettier but possiblyarguably less original in the sense that their factory finish has probably been stripped off and a new one reapplied back in the ss.As for which one you should thats a total toss up.

Its shown more accurately at Not the first time Ive seen the hammer amp spike mark but Ive never been able to determine what it means.
