5716433,0,t3_3tfie6,Theres not much to farming them because theyre in limited amounts from the story getting  total from all S ranks on every difficulty. Events  from dailies and  currently  from login bonus are the other sources once story is finished.However craft weapons and use the shards on character gacha instead. Weapons barely make up  of a characters overall attack stat. Each extra  sub would make up a  of every stat on a character. If youre on a budget a low level note weapon on a  main with three level   subs would hold over fine for a while.That is unless youre already using three  subs on a character but even then theres them cute outfits. Weapon gacha is very much a sinkhole for currency and a luxury at the moment.,battlegirlhighschool,cx5ogze,2,t5_387kl

7060499,0,t1_d1gkf6q,RodCharacter | Notes|Idol Renge main |  attack. Passive autoreloads and  damage to gunsrods.Sirius Haruka main |  attack. Passive autoreloads and  SP heal to all. Shell deal more damage if the enemys defense is closer to your attack value.|Tiara Group Miki sub | She can be compared to a slower Rod type Animal Renge shell deal x damage if all of her hits land. Her utility aspect heals the whole party  and makes everyone immune to status effects. stat sticks |Usage Most of your damage goes from spamming Miki but shes pretty expensive to use. Rods arent exactly in a good place currently so getting a rod with a charged attack to drop meteors would be a good idea.GunCharacter | Notes|Idol Sakura main |  attack. Passive autoreloads and  combo to all.|AB Kokomi sub | .x damage to a large area. Also has  skill burst so subsequent uses makes it .x damage. Hoshimori Maid Subaru sub | x damage multihit area skill if every hit connects. Skill bursted would make it deal .x damage at max. Shes optional since her active isnt as reliable as Kokomis. stat sticks | Usage Get skill burst up from using Kokomi and then either keep spamming her skill for reliable coverage or go for Subaru for potentially higher damage.HammerCharacter | Notes|Valentine Kaede main |  attack. Passive  dodge rolls and  attack to all. Really low base attack but attack passive patches it up a little. Using her as a main would free up a sub slot for an extra stat stick.Sirius Subaru main |  attack. Passive  damage and  SP heal to all. Higher attack but active skill is pretty useless.|Valentine Kaede sub | .x damage over a decent area if all the hits connect. If shes not your main shes your sub. stat sticks |Usage Spam Kaedes skill to clear things. If you can get Animal Renge shes a better option but new cards are coming soon so who knows. Your hammer side isnt that great.SpearCharacter | Notes|Tiara Hinata main |  attack. Passive  attack and  dodge rolls to all. Active deals  hits totaling x damage with the last  hits covering a very large area at x damage each.NY Kurumi main |  attack. Passive  combo to all. Active deals .x damage and enchants thunderbolt so shes still usable despite being powercreeped out by the other two thunderbolt spear users.|Tiara Hinata sub | If shes not your main shes going to be a sub for her skill and nice stats.NY Kurumi sub | If shes not your main shes also a sub for the thunderbolts. stat sticks |Usage Hinatas skill would wipe the field of the weaker enemies but she has some problems dealing with the tougher types. Kurumis thunderbolt buff allows spears to deal with resistant enemies and shreds bulkier ones.SwordCharacter | Notes|Valentine Asuha main |  attack. Passive  combo and  damage to swordsspears.|Bathing Anko sub | .x damage over  autotargeting hits and also poisons.Christmas Kurumi sub | .x damage with decent area coverage and invulnerability buffs. stat sticks | Usage Mostly spam Ankos skill over and over to kill things from anywhere. Kurumis skill is for the buff if you find it necessary and it also covers the area around the user although with low damage. If you can get Sirius Group Asuha from the Hoshimori Idol gacha shell replace Kurumi in the set as a sub.As for teams your spears and guns look to be your best weapon types. Heres a few I can think up of NY Kurumi Spear Valentine Asuha Sword Idol Sakura Gun. Youll mostly use Kurumi as the main killer since thunderbolts ignore affinities and resistances.  combo to all and  damage to swordsspears. This is more of a speedy skill spamming set. Tiara Hinata Spear Valentine Asuha Sword Idol Sakura Gun. Similar to above Hinata carries the team with thunderbolts and area coverage but with a bit more power in comparison.  combo  attack  dodge rolls to all and  damage to swordsspears. Valentine Kaede Hammer Tiara Hinata Spear Idol Sakura Gun. Kaede would deal with the Valgands and Adamas which block bullets and Sakura handles dragons resists spears and raptors resists hammers.  combo  attack  dodge rolls to all. This is even more offense oriented and allows character switching. You can also use this the same as the other two using only Hinata to carry.Theres more combinations that works so itll be finding the balance between speed power and type coverage if necessary.,battlegirlhighschool,d1go2d4,1,t5_387kl

7503479,0,t1_d2v3aye,Well theres other things that hint to there being more to the Idol Debut series but at the end its all speculation Event title says Chapter  Princess and Rouge part. This would hint theres at least a nd chapter and maybe even a rd because they wouldve used First HalfSecond Half if it was two parts. The Star Compass has  stars and only a maximum of two are lit up currently. Permanent gacha with  characters in the pool is a bit too lenient for SakamotoP. This is just a personal expectation though but I believe hes a bit more sadistic than this.This is all of my speculations but Im thinking that the next two idol groups would be at mid May and in the beginning of June. At mid June Im totally guessing that they can make a June Bride set or something. Might as well guess that theyll finish it off with Swimsuits in July. Only SakamotoP knows.Edit Im probably wrong and this is all a ruse so dont get your hopes up.,battlegirlhighschool,d2v3u8n,3,t5_387kl

9996296,0,t3_5ilyrf,Sadone is  Irous and had the ability to control Irous. She was being used by evina to control irous. AFAIK they havent told us about the irous evina and sadones story much where they came from etc.At the end of chapter  Evina stole Sadones ability and left her. Mimi feels bad about her and bring her into their base. Surprisingly only Kaede highly aginst helping Sadone because of her status as former enemy of humanity. Kaede then tried to bring Sadone back to earth but had a fun outing with her instead buying her taiyaki which is why taiyaki is one of Sadones preferred gift. Shit happens after that and in the end Kaede accepted Sadone and they lived together in Kaedes house.Sadones a first year because of her almost zero knowledge of humanity.

11459032,0,t1_dfuqe5n,I dont agree with you there ....Its true that we only have  gems per stage but ... there is fourth time the amount of stages than a normal event. So about twice the number of gems won in the end !If its true that we dont have  a guarantee gatcha for that one it aint the first time either almost all events of this sort are not guaranteed ... why I dont know but well ...The only thing where Im really surprised is that they didnt added a guarantee with purchase but well I dont care.Last of all try to remember that this game is probably the most rewarding for gems or whatever they are called in the other games and most of the time without purchasing you dont have enough to roll on gatcha for the events. And they dont even have a guarantee !!!So if BGHS is dead then all the games are ...The only problem that I see there is that maybe they spoiled us way too much in the past !,battlegirlhighschool,dfuvgkk,2,t5_387kl
