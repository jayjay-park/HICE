I remember seeing and immediately recognising the town gazebo whilst watching an episode of House M.D and Pushing Daisies so Im guessing its used a lot by many shows and its appearance is changed quite often.,GilmoreGirls,ceq4768,3,t5_2sria

2081518,0,t3_2iinb5,Im just restarting the series and I can kind of see what you mean but its worth remembering that this isnt supposed to be a show about the perfect Lorelai Gilmore surrounded by idiots. Its about the imperfect kind of immature Lorelai Gilmore trying and sometimes failing to be a good mother and later on daughter etc.Among other things. Obviously its about Rory too and to a lesser extent other characters.But my point is it wouldve been a very different and not as good show if any of the characters were absolutely perfect and never shallow or petty or just an all around ass.Thats how most people are honestly.

2494000,0,t3_2nfhvq,I sympathize with this I always have this issue too. As avid of a you must watch from episode  to the finale as I am with all series I think it is key to pick a strong episode since GG is definitely a slow burner in season . A few suggestionsThe Bracebridge Dinner  one my favorite episodes particularly from season . It may take a little explanation of the characters but its a great expose of the Stars Hollow dynamic mixed with a little family drama from the Gilmores as well as a touch of boy tension with both Lorelai and Rory. Application Anxiety  Not even one of my favorite episodes but I recently watched it with a very very casual GG watcher and it made me realize how hysterical this episode is. Also doesnt require too much background info other than Rorys applying for Harvard. They Shoot Gilmores Dont They?  Another one of my favorites anything eventrelated is always pretty great on this show. The Dance Marathon is just a classic. If you do want to show a season  episode I say go with The Lorelais First Day at Chilton as opposed to the Pilot. Honestly aside from the revelation about the parents paying for Rorys school and Lorelai having a distant relationship with them youre not missing too much from the Pilot. The dynamic is stronger in episode  in my opinion. ,GilmoreGirls,cmk3qwz,1,t5_2sria
2606395,0,t1_cmypkmo,Well fine I guess Lorelai didnt cheat on Luke.But consider this Lorelai and Luke went to her parents weddinganniversary thing together. Christopher shows up and wants to get back with Lorelai in front of Luke? Imagine that happening to you. I would be filled with blinding rage at the guy and a little sensitive about him.Then you find out that the woman you want to marry goes off and sleeps with him? The day after you guys break up? Sure shes not technically cheating but at least have some respect for the relationship.Then Luke finds out they got married by noticing Lorelais ring. She couldnt even tell him that they did.

He has some rough moments but overall hes my favorite...He really works hard to improve himself for Rory and even when he has to say goodbye to his cushy life... he still works hard to make it right and finds the best way to provide for himself and Rory... I liked Jess... but not for who he was as a boyfriend to Rory... I think however she really helped him reach a much higher potential than he would have without her. I agree with you on him being melodramatic... that is a great way to describe him!Dean was by far my least favorite. He was dull and he cheats on his wife with Rory... I also feel like he spends his whole life jealous of her and angry with her. He was a real jerk afterwards. He played this Oh poor me Ive been divorced and Rory loves rich guys...my life sucks now i gave everything away but HE made those idiotic decisions.

I mean Emily was never so frank and forthright with Lorelai. The thing is Emily sees herself as being Richards equal and cant fathom anyone  thinking they shouldnt be together. Meanwhile she sees Luke as being far below the Gilmores and she can rationalize doing this for Lorelais own good. The fact that Emily did this after she finds that letter really makes her a hypocrite. I love Emily but thats definitely the worse thing she does.,GilmoreGirls,cpe4a5z,13,t5_2sria

4839387,0,t1_cu4besb,As an Asian myself I do think its inherently racistand by saying this I dont mean to call you racist personally or pick fights I just think its an important conversation to have and important to think about. The problem with saying Asians look bad with dyed hair is that its based on the ideal of white being prettier which Asian cultures are actually a big perpetrator of. For Americans being tan is supposed to look nice Asian girls wear makeup to look whiter get plastic surgery to make their noses more European  the grass is always greener on the other side. But the issue with that is I do think Asians especially on TV often get portrayed as asexual or incapable of having romantic interests and when they do interracial ones are rare. Its way more difficult for Asian people to get jobs as models or actors because Americans arent interested in seeing them. So as a minority in a country that rarely gets treated as pretty as white people I think it is harmful and untrue and does in fact come from the roots of racism even if you dont think so.Sorry Im done now I could literally talk about Asian representation on TV for hours... especially when it comes to Gilmore Girls.,GilmoreGirls,cu4jjyg,6,t5_2sria

Rory and Paris also grow closer back in Stars Hollow. Overall just a great episode of relationship development between RoryParis and LorelaiEmily. . Bracebridge Dinner  This episode is just super fun. We get to see all of the main supporting and minor characters interact during a snowy evening at the Independence Inn.

6631370,0,t1_d0583oa,Yeah I have to admit that conversation intrigued me. It seemed like maybe he was actually becoming more mature in that sense. But then he ruined it all again with the taking off to Vegas and the proposal which was manipulative in the extreme. Control is abusive so saying hes not abusive just a little controlling is an oxymoron. I dont mean he would be likely to end up as a total wife beating thug I dont see him that way at all but he has a manipulative streak where he arranges situations in order to get what he wants or reacts to things in just the right way to make people feel like they are changing their mindsactions out of their own free will but surprise it ends up being beneficial for Logan. Its a totally natural thing for him I think and growing up with Mitcham it makes sense. But I think after several yearsdecades Rory would find it hard to deal with especially as I think shed figure out the pattern and confront him which hed then totally turn back on her and then promise to change but actually just slightly change tack.Also I never got the sense that Rory and Logan were a team until the conversation where he says hell factor her in and the post proposal speech although even then it isnt quite right  he doesnt even tell her he has the job until afterwards hes already accepted it hes already mapped things out. He hasnt discussed it with her like a team effort or really thought about what she wants which as she says is freedom and options hes just thought oh there are papers there so she will be happy. I know shes at college and he is working  but they have totally separate lives for the most part.

Hes plainly just an emotionally stunted Neanderthal. He pines for Lorelai for years without telling her and acts like an asshole when she dares to date other people. Hes a constantly miserable downer. He has no interests or passions in life. Hes incapable of having normal romantic relationships. He hid a child from his fiancee for months. There were times when I wished Luke was actually killed off the show his hissy fit upon hearing Christophers voicemail and subsequent pouting his acting like a total idiot around Emily and Richard I thought they had a point about seeing their daughter date a guy like that his Neanderthal behavior in Vineyard Valentine a good preview of a life with Luke all of his rants never funny to me just annoying when he hid April from his fiance who DOES that? and his tortured logic why he did so suckerpunching Christopher and a thousand other examples. It always seemed disconcerting that affection seemed to be connected with aggression to Luke. Even their stupid first kiss in Raincoats and Recipes came on the end of him yelling in her face about how she was leading him on and he was doing everything right.

When I was little a girl from my neighborhood got killed by a rottweiler while playing on my favorite playground. Thankfully I did not witness it but all the blood that was left... just awful... after that I became scared of big dogs. Dont get me wrong I know that most big dogs are not dangerous. I know a few that are just delightful and wouldnt hurt a soul. But to this day I am scared when I see a big dog because I know that if it wants to it could attack me. Especially when you see a tiny skinny woman holding the leash...

7231537,0,t1_d1zu9oa,I honestly dont get this perspective.  I think Rory worked hard for the editorial position at the YDN. Yes they spontaneously decided to consider her when they couldnt agree on anyone else. But they did so because she singlehandedly took a newsroom that had resigned itself to failure and got it running again.  Whatever helpluck she had in actually getting the paper out it wasnt going to happen at all had she not decided to make it happen which was absolutely not her job at the time.  The entire YDN staff regardless of the fact that she hadnt thrown her hat in the ring could agree that they knew her knew her work knew her dedication and thought she would be a great fit for the job.  That is not having something handed to it its earning it.And following Obamas campaign trail was also not handed to her.  She massaged connections to start writing for an online magazine kept writing for them and then an opportunity arose from that.  Thats how getting a job works.  Yes she had to know someone first but I have to wonder if people really think that everyone who has a job or an opportunity that they used their network to get is doomed to failure or is a precious spoiled child the way everyone talks about Rory here.  I think its a bizarre attitude honestly.Plus her internship at the Eagle or wherever not under Mitchum after that when she was getting back on her feet was a result of her being so dedicated and passionate about getting a job there that even though they wouldnt have considered anyone else they decided to give her a shot.I just think the Rory hate has gotten to such a weird point.  Like were supposed to see her reaction to the Mitchum thing and just shrug and say Chilton valedictorian? YDN editor? psh shes obviously a talentless lazy spoiled child.  I would certainly hope I would handle the Mitchum thing better than she did but lets all just take a step back and remember that we are talking about one of the biggest names in the business telling her she doesnt have what it takes to be in it.  Im imagining as a lawyer the solicitor general telling me I dont have what it takes to be a lawyer.

Also I felt like they did Lane hella dirty with the whole had sex once thinks sex is awful gets pregnant storyline. Was it supposed to be funny? Could they not think of anything else for Lane to do?

To even suggest they go out to dinner with them is pretty astounding.Had Rory not been so insistent on making it a day for the two of them I dont think itd be quite as bad.  But she pressured him to hang out and then lightly pressured him to hang out with people she knew he didnt like.

Rory and Paris are hilarious together. Im just surprised so many people are pushing for Rory and Jess when it seemed by the end that he didnt have a strong history with her. Then again Im probably bias because I think SammyJaredDean is cuter than Milo and Matt.On a nerdy note the structure of the story reminds me of Henry the VIII and his wifes. Dean is the steady first wife who gets dumped for Jess the interesting second wife who eventually wears down Rory and lands her with Logan the not as dramatic but comes from a similar background third wife.

I mean hed pined after her for years and always been a steady force in her and Rorys life so I just dont see him letting that go so easily. I also think that maybe if ASP had been on season  I wouldnt have been so anti season . One of the Gilmore guys said his guess was that in season  asp wouldve had the LukeLorelai storyline be Luke being mad at Lorelai for cheating but it being a sort of I love you so I can get past this sort of thing which I totally see happening.

8705476,0,t1_d6tpltd,Thanks a lot and thanks especially for adding your thoughts to several of my posts. Looking back my favourite season is probably Season  i think it slightly edges out Season  for me because i appreciated how the show grew and broadened its identity i think Ss appeal is in how neaty it ties a bow on the first three seasons but S is more ambitious and thus gets the nod from me. My favourite episodes are mostly the same but narrowing it down to a few id go with Rorys Birthday Parties Those Are Strings Pinocchio The Incredible Sinking Lorelais Raincoats and Recipes Wedding Bell Blues and my favourite Friday Nights Alright For FightingIm excited about seeing the three generations of Gilmores at a crossroads in life the different facets of womanhood those three represent has always been my favourite aspect of the show and imo its greatest strength.

When she was annoying the hell out of him he still came through She loved the security she felt with him. She could trust him which isnt something she can do with just anyone.

8801830,0,t3_50lnux,I think its inappropriate personally. But not surprising coming from Lorelai and Chris who had a notoriously inappropriate relationship during various relationships either of them had during the series. ETA I mostly dont like it because she hid it from Luke because she got trashed and because she easily could have gone WITH Rory actually its weird that Rory went stayed a while and then L pulled up right afterwards. I never understood that. Because of the circumstances around how she did it I think it was totally weird. Not bad to help comfort him though. ,GilmoreGirls,d75uzec,2,t5_2sria

Kids get attached to people child or adult and sometimes those people leave after you get attached to them.I agree that its a bad idea to allow someone to take on a parental role and then that person disappears.  But Lorelai would have been introduced as Lukes fiancee not as Lorelai is your new stepmom starting immediately. Just acknowledging that she exists would have been appropriate.Ideally Luke would have told Anna that he was engaged and introduced her to Lorelai. Then even if he agreed to abide by Annas stupid rule Luke and Anna TOGETHER could have talked to Lorelai about keeping her distance. While not the most reasonable way to handle things all the adults would have been on the same page and Lorelai wouldnt have been frozen out.,GilmoreGirls,d77rqos,2,t5_2sria

8946099,0,t1_d7n6fkf,I think you have a point about the deliberately openended nature of the series finale. Interesting that it worked out in opposite ways for the Gilmore girls never really thought about it that way before. Rory and Logan break up but leave a lot of room for reconciliation Lorelai and Luke reconcile but leave a lot of room for separation. Rory and Logan had a very solid foundation for their relationship and they actually communicated. They broke up due to being young and not wanting to sacrifice career opportunitiesa future of endless possibilities it wasnt due to a bad relationship or fighting cheating or lack of trust. It was just circumstances. Luke and Lorelais breakup was solely because of the shittiness of their relationship  zero communication no trust jealousy issues hiding a secret daughter not even being able to properly move in together or plan a wedding. It was screwed up through and through. Sure Luke may have had some epiphany about his compartmentalization issues and Lorelai apologized for banging Christopher...but nothing else about them changed. Theyd still run into the exact same problems asshole loner whos bitter all the time and a stubborn kind of exhausting quirky woman dont exactly scream MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN.,GilmoreGirls,d7n6tfe,5,t5_2sria
8960552,0,t1_d7ows8j,Well I mean I dont know if they necessarily should have been together but both of them seem to really want that. For what its worth I just rewatched it because I couldnt remember the specifics and Chris doesnt give Lorelai an answer when she asks if he is going to move out so I can see why Lorelai assumed he was going back with Sherry but then he tells her I dont know what to do and while Lorelai is certainly too prideful for this she could have easily said something that signified they could work it out together and that they can figure out how he could be involved without actually marrying her.I dont blame Lorelai for that but she seems pretty heart broken about the whole thing and something so simple could have made their whole situation easier.And of course I guess regardless of what Lorelai could have potentially done Im just baffled that Chris cant figure out that he has the option of being with Lorelai the woman hes waited for years to be with per his speech anyway and still be involved with his daughters life. Especially because him deciding to marry someone he was basically done with just because they have a kid together is pretty stupid too. I mean I guess he really could just want that perfect nuclear family but I find it pretty gross that hed rather chase that fantasy than actually deal with some potential messiness to do right by the people he claims to care so much about.,GilmoreGirls,d7ox9oo,1,t5_2sria

I really love this episode for the bit we get to see of Logan and Rory but I do think everyone is just a little over the top in terms of where their character should be. Rory and Logan can be well adjusted but they are just too cozy and the amount of times they could have been to the vineyard just seems bizarre. And Im not exactly sure why Luke is so mad at everything from the get go.

Her hair is Irish curled and it can be a pain in real life so I imagine for TV it is awful to keep it the same.      At one point season ? they have her in anew almost jerry curl.   Good cut but way too much product.       Her part is difficult too.  If you notice her part is very white on film.  Some times they powder it half way.    Later on they start to straighten it but you can so it is straw.     Hair like hers is beautiful in person and awful in print.     The shades that Lauren went thru are minor in reality but annoying in the show.   Black brown Auburn?   The colors often felt off like they missed her skin tones.    Laurens hair is beautiful and they wasted it.    ,GilmoreGirls,d88ydvd,1,t5_2sria

Nobody you used to date shows up in your bushes at am because they have platonic feelings for you.  She pretends to be aloof but she knows the score.When Logan showed up he wasnt entirely sure what this guy had been to Rory and he doesnt know about the bush skulking... but he does know that his gf was going out to what feels like a clandestine dinner with the guy and the guy doesnt know shes in a relationship.But if Logan had  right then  acted upset with Rory what then?  This newcomer wouldnt know all the factors.  And if Logans right about what he says were his immediate impressions of Jess Jess wouldve exploited Logans irritation with Rory as an opportunity to kick Logan while hes emotionally down.I think he treated Jess rudely I dont think it was right but I dont think he had many other options besides shitting rainbows after a long day of travel.,GilmoreGirls,d89btdi,1,t5_2sria

9176508,0,t3_55z6my,I think Lorelai has no problem helping out with Gigi now that Sherry isnt around and she has mostly? moved on to someone else though Im not sure which of those two things was more of a factor.I think she would have done it even in season  when shes still not totally over Chris but in season  she doesnt seem to have any emotional hang ups with it. I also think she would do this for anyone she even remotely cares about.I also agree with other people that Lorelai had an entire towninn to help out with Rory so I dont think its really unfair for Lorelai to spend one day helping Chris. I dont remember the specifics either but doesnt Lorelai offer to help?Side GripeMy issue with the babysitting is that Lorelai has this crazy intuition about whats actually going on with Chris based off of the fact that hes said the preschools are hard to get into and they require tests and the fact that Gigi was a bad listener for one afternoon. He doesnt even say that shes been rejected from the preschools so its weird that she uses that in her argument and while Gigi being awful during the day is probably a good indicator of her usual behavior its a bit of a stretch that Lorelai automatically assumes its because Chris feels guilty about Sherry leaving. I mean Chris is kind of a pushover isnt it totally plausible that he just doesnt want to deal with the discipline part of parenting without needing a reason?,GilmoreGirls,d8f6u5w,5,t5_2sria

He did say he didnt think the person was a bad person or anything super dramatic like that though he does say theyre a piece of sht but he also retracts this by saying not an actual piece of sht just not that cool.

I thought he was pretty good with Marty other than the Lucy dinner thing where he purposefully brought up how Marty and Lucy met knowing full well it would come up how Rory and him met. Look at that scheming on his face. No one can tell me that he didnt know exactly what he was doing there. The entire time hes looking at Rory looking at Marty wheels turning. Was no accident. But originally all I remember is his for the sake of argument with Rory about whether you can treat someone like help if they are being paid to serve you. And Marty would never know that conversation even took place. Otherwise he complimented his work as a bartender. And he offered to pay for his dinner too. His friends were colossal douches though. Enough so that one could argue Logan not calling them out for doing it would count as being a douche to Marty.Whats his face saying My how quaint annoys the hell out of me.

Like Sherry with Yoga was in my opinion directed at her way of being from crazy work Sherry to Yoga Sherry who clearly chose to ease up. Rorys roomate was obsessed with sports which is in no way a healthy thing since obsession never is. I dont really feel like they go against women who put an effort into being thin or healthy if anything they have something with women who do not look as they do like the fat comments which is apparently perfection for them.

Rory freaking out over a negative criticism to me demonstrates that she cant handle pressure or criticism. Its one thing to be upset and to go home and cry about it but to steal a yacht and then decide to not go back to school because she got a negative criticism is ridiculous. Can she write? Yes weve been told she can. Can she lead? Yes weve seen that happen. Would she be able to handle being a journalist where she would constantly be critiqued by other writers and the public?

For example when Emily comments on Lorelais charitable activities in They Shoot Gilmores Dont They? you realize that Lorelai and Emily are engaged in their communities in similar ways even if those communities dont have much in common on the surface. The way they both know how to manipulate people to get their own way even if Lorelai does it by singing like Louie Armstrong and badgering people with references and baby voices and Emily does it by terrifying everyone into submission You should have a mask and a horse when you do that! And the way that both Emily and Lorelai are deeply invested in Lorelai one day having the whole package and are determined for her to achieve that even if they have very different ideas of how to go about that and what it would look like. Even the way they mirror one another in Let the Games Begin when they stand back to look at Richard and Rory before she goes into the Yale office. Honestly I wonder what would be better or worse for their relationship if Lorelai had led the life Emily dreamed for her or the way things stand in the show.

9654931,0,t3_5d9s8k,I think the most likely scenario is a Rogan endgame. However Im seeing more and more potential for a really obvious Jess and Rory storyline. I get this more from the reviews that talk about how the show seems to want to ignore how much time has passed especially when it comes to Rorys current life situationattitude. And a desire to ignore season  entirely.It goes like this dont read if you dont want spoilers though this is mostly just raw speculationRory is jetsetting around the world living a life that jives with what we know of Logans preseason  lifestyle. Very rootless lots of casual sex without commitment living it up without a ton of responsibility. nothing wrong with casual sex or this lifestyle btw.But she starts to feel like it isnt enough to be just floating through life. She feels like she isnt living up to her golden potential very reminiscent of season  when Jess shows up having written a book while she has become a partyplanner for the DAR.And then Jess comes back in. And he challenges her to be more than a freelancer to write something more impactful that a single article for the NYT. And shes drawn to that again. To that part of her that used to want something more than a golden bubble of travel and noncommittal relationships. So she starts to write a book. A good one. Jess is there as she starts to work on it. And as she writes this greatamericannovel she remembers all the reasons she used to love him. Only now hes not some messed up kid who will disappear on her to find himself. Hes a man. Hes matured. He can be there for her. He can push her to not settle for the easy stuff to stretch herself. But he can also catch her when she stumbles and reassure her when she wants to give up.And suddenly playboy Logan isnt enough for her anymore remember we dont have season  Logan. We just have playboy Logan who never decided to manup and find his own path and work hard at life. But Jess...Jess is there for her now. He makes her a better person.I dont know that Id love that storyline because its a rehash of what almost happened in season . But if ASP is really not giving Rory the growth we would expect in a  year gap it could happen.I still hope she ends up with Logan though because I think when his character is at its best he does push Rory to take risks and expect more of herself. And he is there to catch her when she stumbles. But if he regresses to the Logan we all love to hate? Meh. Man that was long. Dont hate me!,GilmoreGirls,da366bu,5,t5_2sria

Dean is the one who made vows to Lindsay and made little to no efforts to uphold them then broke them several times and lied about it. He is the one responsible for their divorce although they are both responsible for the initial choice to get married before being mature enough.That being said I dont condone sleeping with a married man.

9756102,0,t3_5ewdxw,First off Ill reiterate again cause Ive gone back and rewatched their scenes together Ausiellos comments about the subtle expressions was very true. Like I know people maybe feel that perhaps were reading to much into it but really that was some of the most believable acting Ive seen from them together. There was a constant vibe of things unsaid. I didnt skip ahead but I knew where it was heading from spring. The goodbye scene was perfect in its setup. The Christopher scene and the Gazebo scene  I think now you can really go back and see her struggle. Honestly Ive made peace with the ending now. All Id want is for her to contact him hopefully soon after the gazebo scene and tell him. If hes anything like the Logan we knew from before and a big if hed want to know. Fitting he was introduced in written in the stars and so I guess this baby was meant to be as well. Its not pure love its not entirely realistic it is a show but its difficult love. Theyve been in contact for so long  that they had deep feelings for each other this is why they got upset at the end of summer when it was ending. Its just its  and I wish it ended up differently ETA Maybe because Im still slightly in shock from these episodes and pmsing and being awake for the last  hours but I watched their scenes once again and man the Christopher scene and the Gazebo scene really moved me. Im a wreck. You can see how shes trying to hold it together there. Honestly I think if she had gotten pregnant after season season  if asp was there I could see Logan hanging around for the kid. Revival Logan is an enigma. I always feel like he just say the word and Ill be there but I really think hed be involved in the kids life even if theyre not together. It disturbs me more that Rory would hide it from him. ,GilmoreGirls,dafnp19,26,t5_2sria

There was a time when Jess didnt look too good himself as a contender for Rory but a lot of us rooted for him anyway believing in character development and putting our hopes into who he might be. And boy did that pay off. Im one of the people who saw Rorys attitude completely in line with where her character was going. I adore Rory but shes always been a bit entitled and no one ever called it out except when they were being made out to be the bad guy maybe Logan got away with it that one time. But I sympathize with her a lot possibly because I have friends exactly like her who have done much more damage in a shorter amount of time. She had a lot of big dreams and thought nothing stood in her way. No one was helping in their grand expectations of her. Feeling like a failure in such a small community is incredibly difficult. Its very Nina from In the Heights Not to mention Richards passing Logan not stopping his wedding for her her father not fighting for her. Thats a lot of heartache with the men in her life. These are not excuses for being a jerk but they do shed a little light onto her inner chaos.We also dont know enough about Jess right now to make that kind of judgement call. His scenes were never about his own life. Who knows where he is personally or what hes thinking. All we have are the hints and that might be all we ever get. I dont think its fair to disqualify Rory from Jess because shes having someone elses baby. Life is messy like that.

I think I will have to watch it all over again because a lot of my stress during the first three episodes came from the idea that time was running out. I was thinking things like everything is depressing! why is there a  minute musical interlude!? please stop this Logan mistress thing already you are better than this. Why is Luke so angry? I was so worried about everything not being wrapped up enough that I couldnt fully enjoy the episodes. I didnt think I had any expectations about what I wanted this to be but for the first three episodes if felt like something was missing.I REALLY liked fall though it wasnt perfect at wrapping everything up of course but it met the expectations I didnt even know I had. It was the RIGHT kind of emotional. I forgot to worry about how much time was left when I was watching it. I wish all the seasons could have been like Fall was but maybe they had to stress me out like they did for Fall to have the good impact it had on me.EDIT woops I realize now that you are looking for probably actual response pieces and not comments haha sorry! ,GilmoreGirls,dah3o9b,3,t5_2sria

9771229,0,t3_5f4nk5,I know this will upset some people but I thought Logans growth was perfectly human.   He grew into being the core person he was in college.   He was always lazy and reveled in his privileged.    He was always egocentric in his actions.    These characteristics manifest differently in college than they do as an adult.       To me it makes perfect sense that Logan would want Rory as a chippy on the side as an adult.       Rory also clarified as an adult.   She didnt want anything more from Logan than a crash pad and fun times.    Rory treated Paul and Logan the same except she kept forgetting about Paul.   Rory wasnt interested in a marriage or a family and she ran her life in that manner.   Its OK she has that choice.   I dont think she was in love with Logan but rather in love with how easy and free it was to be the part time gal.      Imho,GilmoreGirls,dahiqm5,7,t5_2sria

9772263,0,t1_dahhcx5,gt But with Rory it seemed like ASP ignored a lot of the story if season . Perhaps this is one reason it hasnt bothered me how Rory was in the revival. I hated season  and checked out partway through only coming back for the final episode. Im not sure I even watched all of the episodes. Id say love of the revival was also helped along by not rewatching the series first. My memories of the show are from  so theyre hazy and not perfectly detailed. Makes it hard to nitpick what revival details dont  fit etc. Im going to do my original show rewatch now though I will likely still skip season  if not  and .,GilmoreGirls,dahnbvx,2,t5_2sria

I dont know how to respond to you other than to tell you that i just genuinely did not like it and dont think I can even watch it with a sober mind. ETA also just to make it clear i never thought ASP was a good writer before this but I thought  years would give her time to do better. In my opinion it didnt and almost made her worse. Everything I disliked about the original series was x worse for me in this revival and therefore I dont like it. To say I should be grateful to ASP for creating SH is to overlook the fact that I feel as if she has disrespected her characters. I also have lost respect for the original show knowing this was always her intended outcome for Rory. I find it cheap and lazy and I dont like it. Im sorry that I dont like it I WANTED to like it. I got up at AM and couldnt contain my excitement only to feel disappointed let down and disgusted.

9774259,0,t1_dahv1h9,I dont perceive Chris or Logan as the villain either. There were no villains in the series just seriously flawed characters who always had a shot of redemption or needed major growing up. Ive mentioned before Logan had so many opportunity or chances to leave Odette for Rory but he did not do that! We saw him in many instances dining at fancy restaurants willing to throw a hotel or house there to keep the secret affair going but ultimately that does not mean it was exactly the best decision ever. I think at some point in the  years gap Logan caved big time to the pressures of the high society and got comfortable with the idea of it all in the end agreeing to the engagement solidified this and to the point where he was going to marry Odette anyway. With all that happening and him knowing about Rorys baby I dont believe he would walk away from that in an instant. I agree that Revival Logan is simply too settled in his lifestyle and wouldnt even change his decision about the engagement since ASP did some major character assassinations. Whereas Christopher just settled for the bed that he made and that was sad to witness yet he seemed to be okay with his decisions. He knew Lorelai would be the better caregiver and he just stepped aside. Lorelai and Chris have tried numerous times to make their relationship work but life just doesnt go that way that easily sadly.,GilmoreGirls,dahw6o6,13,t5_2sria

9775752,0,t3_5f74gq,Thats a nice call back between the two of them and where they are respectively. I always found it weird that Rory was the valedictorian instead of Paris tbh and during things like debates or speeches Rory never struck me as the super intellectual that wowed others and was definitely Harvard bound vs. Paris who was so confident and well spoken albeit abrasive. Though I sort of chalked that up to Alexis Bledels acting and went under the assumption that the audience is supposed to buy into Rory being special at least at the high school level.But Im glad to see Paris has done well for herself. She was consistently ambitious and had a tremendous work ethic and was never coddled or put on a pedestal and as confident as she was she was also under appreciated and invisible to boys vs. Rory. She earned everything she got. If nothing else thats a nice message for younger viewers out there.,GilmoreGirls,dai2sq3,31,t5_2sria

There was a story in the news a while ago about a woman who was unable to carry a baby for whatever reason but her mother in her s carried it for her. Daughters egg grandmas  year old uterus. So unless Lorelai has a problem they havent mentioned she could carry a baby just fine if she wanted to. But those  year old eggs would be hell to fertilize.

9782166,0,t1_daioiic,Nope no Yale. Lorelai herself said she was meant to go to a college like Vasser or Smiths and marry a Yale man like her mother did. I found that interesting because by the time Rory grows up to be a teenager full of potential is accepted at Yale etc. Richard obviously changes his views. This can be seen when Rory is on her break from Yale. Richard realises he wants more for Rory than Emilys life being a socialite DAR darling etc. causing Emilys breakdown.

Hes loyal to his family... but he doesnt even like his father. And he doesnt seem happy with his work or any of his other relationships besides with Honor and the LDB.

9811587,0,t3_5fqc2c,In my mental reedit after covering Obama Rory went overseas and reported on the Arab Spring.

Yet it also left her in the mood to ignore the world and become more selfcentred. She writes think pieces for various cultured journals and tries to pivot her career in a new direction. Her grandfather dieswhich leaves her with a substantial annuitybut she begins to question where shes headed and what shes doing it for. The Revival catches her at a low point in her life.I think the concentration on journalism in the Original Series was simply because its hard to make studying literature dramatic. But really Rory was always much more interested in literature than journalism. Yet she falls into journalism because she wants to be cool. Rory ought to have been a woman of letters majoring in English literature and going onto a doctorate in modern feminist authorship. Writing literary studies of Virginia Woolf and Maeve Binchy.

You dont want to worry us about the guys she date but her life is a mess theres nothing interesting about her in the present situation except she seems uncapable of being a decent journalist seriously its hard for journalists right now and therefore it has to be like that for her???? ASP you dont know shit! I AM a journalist! I know its not easy! But this is not about being easy or hard this is a about a character you are writing as a completely useless being for her CHOOSEN profession!. You dont want us to worry about the guys? Then you make her single lesbian a fucking nun! Make her married make her being cool with sleeping with a guy whos engaged jealousyanyone? dont make her a useless girl who depends on her grandmother mother and boyfriend to pay for her traveling and dresses and stuff.

It is insulting that she consider us being idiotic morons who have nothing in life but to measure a girl for the guys she dates... I really loved parts of the new chapters I seriously see Lorelai and Rory as my models still  years later and I could completely relate with Rory and her struggle because I am in ways in the same path.

9867737,0,t3_5go7ju,I agree. It doesnt fit the overall tone of Gilmore Girls at all. Lorelai took charge of her own life at  and never wavered. Rory ends the series turning down a proposal from a guy she loves just because she wants the freedom of choosing her own future. Logan breaks away from his fathers firm and joins a startup in Palo Alto. Jess improves as a person and ends up an author with a publishing job. Lane moves out of her mothers house and marries a nonKorean. Hell even Emily learns tax software and realizes she owns windmills. The show was about moving forward. Or rather realizing you can move forward without necessarily cutting off your past Lorelai and her parents make peace Rory reconciles her Stars Hollow past with her Yalehigh society present Lane makes peace with her mother and becomes a mother herself etc. etc.. The revival was just a grim Life is a circle. Youre inevitably going to turn into your parents and repeat their mistakes downer.

They would only likely cover a few grand per year but it might be enough to make up the difference....And as an edit when I started school  directly before Rory I knew so many people who themselves or their families thought their financial aid was a scholarship package that it was almost comical. My roommate even showed me how much better she was than me via her financial aid package and that her scholarships were bigger than mine. No dumbass that was a federal loan and we are in our mid s and she now lives in another country from her husband and is still trying to pay it back.

As a teenager I had some trouble seeing Rory and Deans affair as incharacter for either of them partly because I really idealized Dean which sounds like how you see Logan but over the last decade Ive come to see that as totally plausible depressingly so. In life people you thought of as noble and strong are totally capable of doing disappointing things that you never would have predicted no matter how well you know them. And sometimes people you despise surprise you in a good way. There isnt anything I see from the characters as implausibly inconsistent. People are generally good natured and try to do right but theyre also prone to weakness and screwing up in unexpected ways.

10196147,0,t1_dbzrwt5,The fact that he is nice to the pretty girl was not my main point. It was more that she could convince him to do nice things for other people. The toaster thing for instance was after she screamed at him and told him how badly the town was treating Luke because of him. I think he felt genuine guilt at that and reached out in a small way. Its hard to deny his earlier jerky status. He was mostly a jerk with a few redeeming moments thrown in. Its really seeing his development even as early as season  early in the season hes angry and mean and rude to everyone. By the end hes thanking Luke for trying to do right by him and taking the sappy love textbook to heart. We dont see him again until season  when hes moderately successful insomuch as hes doing what he wants and seems to have found peace not so much in that hes making a lot of money and he and Luke have a very positive relationship. As for Liz I guess well never know for sure. I read a compelling post here before as to why she may have been into darker stuff than we ever concretely see and that she really cleaned herself up by the time we actually meet her. Remember that we dont meet her until two and a half years after we meet Jess when she ships him off to Luke. Its entirely possible that with the right motivation and people in her life since then that shed have cleaned up before we meet her. Even if she really was only a hippydippy chick remember that shes also moved from guy to guy their entire life and never seemed to have given Jess any kind of structure. People blast Lorelai from time to time about a lack of parental structure but she was a Catholic school nun compared to what we see that Liz did for Jess. Long story short if we had never seen Jess again after he left in season  or even  I dont think Id be team Jess. But we get to see how far he comes and so much of that change comes from within. That has to mean something. ,GilmoreGirls,dbzsfkt,1,t5_2sria

While I do not support him and Rory as a romantic ship I would really like to see them as a real friendship one. In season . I felt Jess was being a true friend to Rory by telling her everything everyone else was thinking but not daring tell her as they all feared shed shut them out just as she shut out Lorelai.

I would do my best to ensure my daughter is prepared to date someone like that and I would tell her about the kind of support compassion and love someone like Jess needs even in the hardest of times. As an adult I would not take his anger personally and I would do my best to help him no matter how rude he may be.If I had people who had just ignored me for my life hardships growing up I wouldnt be where I am today.

10443241,0,t1_dcrrmbg,Yep but my school had a very theoretical approach towards everything thus we studied the physic of the electronic components more than we studied their actual application which led to issues later on. You can blame the school other schools taught differently. Those were the concepts I had the hardest time with as I found them completely abstract and it caused me many issues on laboratories afterwards hence my comment stating physic is hard. These also were those I butted my head for hours long trying to decipher. I have no doubt higher level physic than what I did is extremely hard I consider it to be one of the hardest studying fields so kudos to you  I have a lot of respect for people who can go through with it as I suspect I wouldnt have lasted.Did all the math you mentioned though.And yes I absolutely agree with you on how bad the teaching was... It wasnt so much the teachers were bad but the whole University approach as I said it had a reputation for it. I heard it is better now they changed many things since I was there so hopefully for the better but they did make you sweat for your grades.I had terrible lecturers and there were classes were I decided not to attempt to as my time was better invested reading the material than listening to the teacher. The problem were the classes were said written material didnt exist... You kinda of had to try to get something out of the bad lecturer we would group together and try to make sense out of it. Other endless hours of pleasure.Classes with complete set of notes were OK.  I had one class where all I had to study for the final were three half filled out pages with two drawings... Gee.

Of course there are some points that I enjoyed like Emilys storyline and the Life and Death Brigade showing up but overall it wasnt canon to the OS and because of this everything that happened didnt fit andor was a waste of time. We saw Luke and Lorelai get over their communication issues yet ASP brought them back. Logan changed for the better but now hes back working for his dad and in a relationship he doesnt want to be in. Emilys story arc was the only worthwhile one to watch and I feel that was only because ASP had to work with the death of Richard.If this revival happened five years ago then maybe I couldve believed it and then they couldve built on the story another five years later on or something.

10796304,0,t1_ddta9rj,I agree with you that the ChrisLorelai thing probably shouldve happened at some pointbut they didnt need to get married. And I actually think that her sleeping with Chris in season  episode been enough of it happening. ,GilmoreGirls,ddtk8fs,1,t5_2sria

10943405,1,t1_de8pq7c,If youre going by that logic every crazy bitch whos poked a hole in a condom is a rapist. But I bet youre not willing to call them that. I bet youre one of those crazy new age feminists that cries rape when a guy looks at her too long. The scenario you described is vastly different from the one in the show and youre crazy if you think theyre alike. You know what else is crazy? Demanding your husband get a vasectomy basically without his consent. What about bodily autonomy? What about his rights? Whats truly insane is thinking hed actually do it without sitting down and discussing it. If the shoe was on the other foot and he demanded she got her tubes tied youd be in an uproar over that. ,GilmoreGirls,de8qgx5,1,t5_2sria
10965118,0,t3_5wbm57,Honestly I thought it was better than S and AYITL. The new writers did the best they could with ASPs mess. I barely noticed a difference in feel of the show.,GilmoreGirls,deaz3k7,5,t5_2sria
11026924,0,t3_5xc3bi,Ive watched GG all the way through a good  or  times and several times more just having it on in the background while doing other things. Still love it just as much as I did the first time I watched it in fact Id argue I like it even more. There are so many references and small details in GG that its impossible to catch them all with only one watch through! Definitely recommend watching it again to anyone.,GilmoreGirls,dehvkty,1,t5_2sria
11030726,0,t3_5xid5q,I love the scene in Rorys dance when Emily is taking care of Lorelai and she puts the blanket over her and pushes her hair out of her face and Lorelai whispers thank you mommy. I just love the look on Emilys face after she says it. ,GilmoreGirls,deib34j,29,t5_2sria

11040259,0,t3_5xn6r9,I honestly dont know how I feel. Emily and Lorelais storylines felt so final bar the whole kids thing with Luke and Im not all that interested in seeing what happens with Rorys pregnancy. I can see why others would want more conclusive answers though. ,GilmoreGirls,deje6x3,12,t5_2sria

11080649,0,t1_demp2p7,But we look at intent for crimes all the time. If you hit someone with your car and they die you get a different charge and sentence if it was an accident than if you intentionally ran them over. Intent matters in many areas of law. ,GilmoreGirls,denzcl1,2,t5_2sria
11098319,0,t1_depwwi2,It was in the AOL build interview and others. Things like the fans shouldnt be greedy wanting more. I understand wanting to talk about current projects but he could have said it without almost sounding condescending. ,GilmoreGirls,depzgq6,3,t5_2sria
11098346,1,t1_depyd3w,It just gives me a bad vibe and that he does not care. He does not seem to care about the fans and the fact that a show he did years ago is one that people still care about. Especially since it was reasonable brought back with a cliffhanger so of course it is on the public consciousness now. It makes me not want to support the things he does even if something actually looks interesting to me. ,GilmoreGirls,depzkpa,-1,t5_2sria

11171940,0,t1_dexs1r5,During the first season I kept expecting to see Mr. Kim appear because Lane kept referring to her parents. By season  I realized we were never going to see him lol. The pilot portrayed Rory in a way that was OOC for most of the seriesas a petulant teenager willing to throw away the chance of a Chilton education for a boy she just met. We also see Lorelai play the mom card which we dont really ever see her do again.  In the first half of season  Sookie cant take two steps without falling down and injuring herselfIm glad they toned that down it quickly became annoying. In season  the town folk like Chris when he visits Miss Patty was a shameful flirt but when Chris moves to SH in season  they act like they dont know him. The harpist at the Independence Inn vanishes. I guess I watch this too much lol.,GilmoreGirls,deybsif,21,t5_2sria
11181828,0,t3_5zlgn1,I love what Rory wore while tap dancing in Ayitl. Also the yellow dress after she slept with the wookie!,GilmoreGirls,dezg4db,2,t5_2sria
11197303,0,t1_df16ip8,Nice!  It is a great show in many ways it reminds me a lot of GG.  Quirky small town great soundtrack drama and comedy well acted etc.  The downside is that it is hard to find streaming,GilmoreGirls,df178nh,3,t5_2sria
11267026,0,t3_60pecj,Ugh just let the show die with those four words and be done with it. The revival didnt give me anything but hate for the girls and a lot of respect for Emily. Just bring me a season of Emily. ,GilmoreGirls,df93n3z,26,t5_2sria
11279285,1,t1_dfad3q3,gtSo I assume they both naturally regulate their eating. Some people are better at moderation than others. For example if my husband has a big meal for lunch he wont eat anything for dinner.Well Im not sure if that information is very accurate. Im not a nutritionist but mine always says that these kinds of carbohydrates like the ones you mentioned pizza biscuits and etc. are simple carbohydrates of the monosaccharide type which means that they turn into energy as soon as digested throwing high rates of sugar in the bloodstream overloading your pancreas and facilitating the accumulation of fat that is not digested.I would venture to say that the only way to continue eating these carbohydrates eventually without gaining weight would be to balance the diet for the rest of the dayweek without eating carbohydrates or just ingesting the complexes ones like yams oats beans chickpeas soybeans....Theoretically of course even balancing through not eating so much during the day would still require a good daily dose of exercises to counter this buildup IF a person wants to keep in shape.Practically staying too long without eating only accustoms the body to storing fats faster not being an effective method. They would get fat anyway and would probably develop diabetes if they did not change their lifestyle.Obviously this may somehow be working for your husband because peoples metabolism is different Although all of them worsen with age but it is highly unlikely to be effective for someone who consumes the amount of sweets and fat they do.If anyone there is an expert on the subject please correct me.,GilmoreGirls,dfaho2g,2,t5_2sria

11625201,0,t3_65vh79,Chris is the designated spoiler for LampL. Of course fans hate him.I dont think he was a terrible person. I dont even fault him all that much for sleeping with Lorelai at the end of S. Hed been in love with her for  years. It wouldve taken a titanic amount of selfcontrol to tell her no when she showed up. That said Chris doesnt even have a moderate amount of selfcontrol e.g. walking out on her and turning his phone off when he found her letter about Luke in S and was a mostly absentee father both things we can fault him for. The conversation between him and Rory at the very end of AYITL summed it all up really. One of the best scenes in the series IMO.,GilmoreGirls,dgdq8b4,15,t5_2sria

11661355,0,t3_66dwck,I think Lorelai would have ended up doing what she ended up doing having had Roryrunning her own business. She did get a business degree an Associates I believe which suited her purpose. Getting an MBA from Harvard wouldnt have been necessary though she would have enjoyed it. ,GilmoreGirls,dghtvb9,5,t5_2sria
11684729,0,t1_dgj8qhe,If Lorelai hadnt had Rory or run away I dont think Emily really would have given Lorelai much choice but to follow in her footsteps. Lorelai rebelled some against her parents but the kind of money and pressure they would have put on her would have put her Logan was. Lorelai was their only child and of course was going to be expected to be minime to Emily. So she could have ended up married to Christopher or whomever her parents essentially chose and forced her into and being the executive wife like Emily or maybe something their society would see appropriate for a woman like working for a charity or becoming an event planner. The only way out of it would be to turn against her parents and leave like she did.,GilmoreGirls,dgkhc8k,0,t5_2sria
11697637,0,t3_66bj1l,This is actually such an accurate post. When I first found this community I posted about how I think that Jess was kind of written wrong as in I thought that once he was with Rory he would get it together and be good with her. But its so true I feel like theres so many people out there like me who want to believe that Jess could be great but in the end hes a teenager who doesnt really know what hes doing and he hurts people in the process.,GilmoreGirls,dgly1xm,2,t5_2sria
