Walked out of the door some huge Blake griffin looking guy stops Infront of me and some white trash looking woman behind me says excuse me sir I believe you have Walmart property the woman was dressed like a normal shopper but she worked there I forgot what the name for her job is but it turns out she followed me though store. I went to the survalence room . She was lieing to the people there about what I did at least exaderating. But they were talking about prosicuting me because the price of the game is over  and Im over  but they didnt understand what I stole or why I stole it and the one person who knew didnt know how to explain it so they just called my parents and they picked me up and all I have to do is deal with them now.,Shoplifting,clan6vf,-2,t5_2qyxh

Of course It has to be a small amount like just a drink or usually something from the hot and ready section. This one time I was with my friends and I wanted to show off because I was the only one from my school that never got caught. And I did a step by step thing showing them what I was taking. I picked up a full rack of ribs placed a large onion rings on it moved over to the candy area and filled a huge bag of score bites and got a full case of coke.

But if its in a very congested area and gets a bunch of traffic in and out of the store then you better bet they have cameras every where. You need to go some where in the suburbs or where theres a store that had more of them within a few mile radius. Not actually a few I just suck at estimating distance. It depends on what you grab. The more expensive it is the more likely cameras will be there. The more popular it is the more likely there is to be cameras. Groceries NEVER cameras usually. Maybe some cameras that can see into the Isle but not watching groceries. Do your concealment there.

Clearly very far fetched.Scam returning stolen items for gift cards only works for clothes mostly a D not relevant for SteamScam  Jacking a gift card and calling the company for help lying that the codes dpnt work.

Repeated theft is noticed especially if you take the same items in which case LP and surveillance will concentrate on those items. Theft is often noticed before stocktakes now because a certain number of sales triggers an automated alert to restock the shelves when a certain number are remaining if you take items that alert wont be triggered and the empty shelf if you dont take all the stock when the rest are gone will alert staff as to a discrepancy. Lastly the more you steal in the same place the higher your odds of eventually being caught and the more recognisable you become especially if your visits coincide with items missing. ,Shoplifting,d2tm5j4,8,t5_2qyxh

8344262,0,t3_4ti4gc,OP I read through the comments and saw some disagreements. Here is what I know from the Walmart in my area its a poor area and there is littletono LP Small stores nowadays may only have a single manager to alter pricing within the computer systems but larger stores have someone handling inventory per department. Not once but twice I saw someone with an item marked clearance told by a cashier that the marked item was not in fact from clearance. Neither employee called management to confirm. They could both tell flat out that the item had not been marked down. Both times they were pointed to Customer Service.From what I can tell stockers and cashiers do not exchange duties.  All inventory is done  electronically even in the poor south. I even had a conversation with one woman because she had a really neat wrist mount for her little tablet set up.  Information is all sent and stored digitally. This is why most items are not given separate price tagsbar codes. That information is already stored. Employees do not need to physically calculate receipts to currency inregister. They can simply print out a digitized projection of all figures neatly mathed for them. Whether they shortchange or overchange for cash is still on them.So that roll is useless. Maybe the employee responsible wont care. Maybe the manager wont either. I really dont know the particulars of their product waste policy. So LP might not be involved regarding the roll.But I can tell you that unless you produce a recognized bar code for scanning you wont be getting any discounts with that roll.,Shoplifting,d5kl4ru,1,t5_2qyxh
8356815,0,t1_d5lli7f,I found it really hard to stop for the same reasons. It had become a habit but also I still struggle financially and every time I go grocery shopping I have to put things back.

Its always cat gets fed and use tissues etc but just trying to illustrate what happens every time I shop and how frustrating it is. Its really hard to not just conceal the other item so you can get them both. I had to keep on reminding myself every point of the way what the stakes were. I took friends with me every time I went in the shops or made sure there was no way I could conceal no bags no pockets no clothing appropriate for the job. Took me a while. Maybe a year? But now I might feel the twinge every now and then when things are really tight but no chance whatsoever of acting on that urge. Its a beautiful feeling.

9201029,0,t3_56c6ki,yes it is still possible for you to get caught. maybe someone notices that your bag is more full when you walked out compared to when you walk in. maybe someone notices you have an empty hanger or are walking out with a normally foldeddisplay item on a hanger. maybe you just unconsciously look suspicious shifty eyes etc. maybe you go into the same store fairly frequently and go into the fitting room with several items but you never actually buy anything. someone will notice you after a while. this is just off the top of my head there are definitely more ways you can get caught doing this. its generally an ok method as long as you are super careful lucky and dont frequent the same stores all the time.,Shoplifting,d8iaqtg,5,t5_2qyxh

A lot less of a mess than digging through the trash outside.When I was homeless this was my main way of getting money.  In the city they put all their trash outside to be picked up.  I would find that  bag and go through it saving only the cash and debit card receipts.  A lot of stores will give you cash back with a debit card receipt. Im not doing  that any more but I would make day that way.  Used to have a big ziploc bag of cash receipts and wrote everything on a sheet of paper and would get  items at a time.

This allows you to find the back exit then you can park your car where that exit is. Put paper on your plates first and put them back on in another parking lot.

10498595,0,t1_dcxosrw,Yeah its a doubleedged sword potentially.  I always see it as like they give you the benefit of the doubt.  Like for example the guys at GameStop know that I bought an HTC Vive from them because any time they try to hustle points out of me for a pro membership I say something like Nah I paid  for a Vive to get those points Im not gonna waste em on that I dont buy used or trade games.  And I feel like if they know that you regularly drop hundreds of dollars in there theyd be skeptical of thinking that youd be lifting a  blind box or figure or whatever.Same with Toys R Us the other day.  I was hunting Batman Lego movie Legos back in December before they were officially out and that specific store had a set no one else had at the time but it was  more expensive than the MSRP.  I tried to get them to match the Lego catalog price but they said they dont do that.  But whatever I was willing to wait and bring my receipt back when everyone else had it for  less and get them to price match.  So I did eventually do that and when I went in to lift from that store the other day I ran into the manager and was like Hey they did price match that  set down to  so I got my  bucks back and he was like Awesome man or something.  But I feel like that makes them not even take a second glance at you.

10596314,0,t3_5ro579,I have personally never done this. I just live by the rule that if I cannot afford it or lift it I dont need it. It would be nice to get store credit for shit I cant lift but Im kinda nervous about it. I know most places require ID for a return especially without a receipt and Im not trying to hand over my identification to a place that may or may not be watching me from previous lifts. If Im lifting and get a bad vibe I can ditch my shit and get out but if I get a bad vibe halfway through a fraudulent return Im screwed cant really just run out of the store when they are holding my license. I suppose I could get a fake ID for that purpose but thats a lot more effort than Im willing to put in unless Im looking to get like several hundred dollars worth of shit. ,Shoplifting,dd8xfdm,1,t5_2qyxh

11150031,0,t3_5z15b2,I dont smoke myself but from everything Ive heard stealing cigarettes successfully is practically impossible nowadays. Theyre kept behind the counter at pretty much every store that sells them.Your only options really are to either grab them from the behind the counter and RUN and pray that you dont get caught or try to break into the store after hours and steal them that way. Both options are EXTREMELY risky and your chances of getting away successfully are slim to none.Sadly there are some things that are basically just impossible to steal no matter how slick your shoplifting skills may be  and cigarettes are one of them. Sorry bro.Have you considered quitting? I know that quitting smoking can be difficult but if you cant afford to buy cigarettes anymore and you cant steal them then its probably your best option and your only option really. Trust me in the long run youll be glad you quit. Youll save an incredible amount of money each month cigarettes are insanely expensive nowadays  think of all the other things you could be doing with that money! and the health benefits are practically countless. As soon as you quit your body begins to repair the damage caused by smoking. Quitting smoking greatly reduces your risk for numerous diseases cancers COPD and reproductive complications. It lowers your blood pressure and heart rate almost immediately. Your risk of a heart attack declines within  hours of quitting. Your hearing vision and sense of smell will improve. Food will taste better. Your breath hair and clothes will smell better. Quitting also stops the damaging effects of tobacco on how you look including premature wrinkling of your skin gum disease yellowing teeth and tooth loss.Check out smokefree.gov for tools tips and advice on how to successfully quit.Thats my best advice. My husband was a packaday smoker for  years but he successfully quit about six years ago and considers it one of the best things he has ever done. The amount of money he saves each month is extraordinary and he says that he feels about a thousand times healthier and happier than he ever did while he was smoking. The first few days of quitting can be rough but its definitely worth it. Millions of people have quit smoking and you can too. Hope that helped. Good luck with whatever you decide to do man.,Shoplifting,devue7j,2,t5_2qyxh

11545062,0,t1_dg4l6n0,as long as you dont sprint out of the store yeah. In general the less time you spend around after you conceal the tougher it is for me to figure out if you concealed maybe I need to review footage to see if I missed something run out and find a package etc. Also the less time you spend concealing the less time I have to find you. Im either watching you or Im not so if you grab merchandise and wander around picking off tags and boxes and then go into a blind spot to conceal I have ten minutes to prepare you are giving me confidence that I know you are stealing etc. But if you walk straight to the merchandise and conceal it as quickly as possible I only have a few second window to see it.Also this comment is fucking gold advice.

11571161,0,t1_dg7jfl0,This.I lifted a pair of pricey skullcandys from that store only a few days ago. I took them out of the packaging though because my outfit at the time was not suited to concealing a box. I hadnt been to Best Buy in a long while so I was concerned about the man up front checking receipts and the CCTV feeds on his monitor. I ended up going into a restroom to surgically remove what I wanted and ditched the packaging in the waste basket with some paper towels over it to give it some camo Because Im weird like that. After slipping the goods around my neck I was wearing something that could hide anything around my neck I pretended to start up a phone call and stood around for a minute before making my way to the exit hoping the yellow shirt wouldnt bother me if I was on a call. I was right and he made no effort to stop me. Left the store with a  pair of headphones. Best Buy itself does seem scary to lift from since they have so many cameras and employees but I think if you act calm and casual they wont catch on to anything. It could just be my store though. Its in a relatively middleclass shopping district.,Shoplifting,dg7li24,4,t5_2qyxh
