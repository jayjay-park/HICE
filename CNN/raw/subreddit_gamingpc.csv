126283,0,t1_cesskh2,Weve been hitting the ILP wall for a while now and the problem with growing a single core any larger than the ones we have now is that the latency of just communicating something across the core not even the whole chip takes too long for that information to be useful without significantly impacting the clock speed.  You cant simply throw twice the transistors at a core because now you have twice the leakage current double the area and might gain at best  performance improvement. You cant just make the caches bigger because that makes them slower you cant just add more pipeline stages because that hurts branch misspredict penalties just look at the P netburst architecture. You cant just add more ALU components because there isnt any more ILP to extract and branch prediction is already incredibly accurate  making it much better adds energy and can hurt the clock speed.In short one does not simply make a core faster.

I know the  is blown out but without that youre leaving people or maybe just me thinking the inside of your case looks like this when its actually much much more stunning. I have to do photography as part of my job so if youll forgive a little more unsolicited advice there are two ways you can fix it to get the best of both in one photo. If you take two photos from the exact same angle one showing the inside as bright and one showing the  properly. Then if you import them on top of each other as layers in a photo editor you can make a composite of the two by maskingerasing the too brighttoo dark depending on which layer is on top areas of the top layer to get a single evenly exposed image. Kind of like this crude mockup The other way is to look into making a HDR photo out of the two but its a little more complicated so I wont go into it now. ,gamingpc,cisivxx,1,t5_2sq2y

11102305,0,t1_deqbe4g,Didnt read through the whole thing but with backups to HDD the data loss risk is reduced so youre right there isnt much reason to avoid it.Personally I still wouldnt do it because of issues surrounding booting from RAID volumes and the reliability of onboard RAID controllers but my motherboard is really old so maybe these things arent concerns with more modern gear.,gamingpc,deqfqap,2,t5_2sq2y

Why are you assuming that we dont work just because we built our own PCs? Im a complete noob with building PCs and honestly I just followed the  hour tutorial by Newegg on YouTube and it was a piece of cake. You really cant dedicate ONE day to learn and build out of all your free days in a year? Come on bro.You preach time is money and yadda yadda. If you really respect your own hard earned dollars you wouldnt do yourself justice buying a piece of shit prebuilt like that.,gamingpc,dglk6v7,3,t5_2sq2y

Also noise etc etc. Plus you never know what the future holds. Maybe Vega will have insane bang for your buck and provide perfected Crossfire. Suddenly all the hardcore gamers need x GPUs instead of x GPU and W PSUs.In any case the difference between a sufficient PSU and a never worry about it ever again PSU is like  which is nothing in terms of hardware.I would never ever safe money on the PSU.
