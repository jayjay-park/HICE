4668679,0,t3_3ev2rs,Good concept some fantastic moments but overall the themes and the panel layout hold it back. Miller wasnt a bad writer yet and his dialogue in this book is actually really good. Its the clunky exposition through internal monologue that gets old after awhile. The art may be the best Miller ever did but the panelling is absolutely atrocious at points and its very distracting from the story. Much like Hush and Long Halloween its s book I mostly enjoyed at first but subsequent readings have lead to me finding  several problems. To sum it all up its a book that a respect fir its impact and one that I even go back to for some classic moments but its not a favorite and I rarely recommend it. ,DarkKnightDiscussion,ctj1ghe,2,t5_2vvmb
