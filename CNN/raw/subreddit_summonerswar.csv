1498831,0,t1_cj40e2n,Mostmany  base units are worth investing into. Not all but many. I dont have a yellow Phantom myself so I cant say for sure but my red Phantom is pretty awesome. The awakened yellow Phantom has a pretty nice leader skill for Arena. Id suggest putting FatalBlade with  Atk on him to see if you might like him as a . Alternatively you can do FatalFocus or FatalEnergy.Hellhound would probably benefit most with FatalBlade with  Atk runes. Hes extremely fragile but if he stays alive for at least two turns he can buff the entire teams attackcrit then do some really good damage on his own. However red Inugami is a better choice if youre comparing the two. Or both I did both but I dont plan to  Hellhound.. might use him as evo fodder.,summonerswar,cj45ih4,1,t5_324pd

I swap him in as an attacker if the team im facing has a strong fire attacker that he can soak damage from.  Your new inugami is quite powerful too take him to at least .  I use a lulu blue howl on my defense team and in some harder dungeons just because of his healing two heal spells and a normal attack that increases his attack gauge so in my opinion the blue howl is worth it to at least  as well.  ,summonerswar,cjebeiw,1,t5_324pd

Personally Im a bit hesitant in  starring an unawakened anything  their stats are a bit low and are generally missing a skill or  in the rakshas case  eff acc which DOES mean something for her debuff Sadly as I pointed out earlier your only options for fodder atm are fire phantom tails werewolf hound witch and angelmon. Personally I only think the hound and angelmon are worth foddering. Id level up the  stars for more food. As for who to take to ...like I said Id choose an awakened nuke...maybe the hound.

1690882,0,t1_cjsa36o,Im not an expert but your planning looks good for the near term.  I might suggest replacing the Water Inugami for a Fire Inugami if you come accross some.  The fire Inu is very useful in farming so I hear Im building up my own fire Inu now.  In addition to your plans here is my advice no particular order Level the Fire Hellhound to  or  and awaken.  Its awaken skill is a large attack boost.  Feed it other hellhounds to max its skills purchased in shop or dropped from Faimon .  Some poeple like the water hellhound but Ive never gotten into it. Early on many people like the Light Garuda for Arena defense for its resurrection ability.  You might want to take it to  and feed it your other Garudas to improve its skills. That Water Howl is liquid gold.  Awaken him ASAP so that he will have two healing spells.  Water Howl is among the best healers at low to mid levels IMHO.  Make sure you feed him other howls to max his skillswhen this is done he can heal  out of every  turns and debuff to boot!,summonerswar,cjsastd,2,t5_324pd

2070874,0,t3_2ikz35,Im working on fusing a Water Undine right now.  Looking at her skills she seems pretty lackluster and is pulled in a lot of directions.  Her attack is pretty high with an aoe attack and critbased freeze which leads me to believe despairfocus wouldnt be a terrible combo on her maybe with spdcritacc to try to be a CC machine.  I think I would try to count her heal and revive as a bonus not her core role.  You could capitalize on her attack instead runing fatalblade spdcritatk for a bursty aoe and freeze chance but there wouldnt be the accuracy there to accurately land any CC.    Overall I think she lacks enough direction to be good at any one role and instead is okay at a lot of roles.  She would be a CC beast if she had an added effect on her Aqua Frenzy as well.    edit I said Ice Drop instead of Aqua Frenzy in the above paragraph ..

2165875,0,t3_2jto76,Hmmm several points I want to correct you on. . Acc means accuracy. It means how ACCURATE you are at placing debuffs. By no means does it increases proc chance just the chance of that buff actually landing. Since all monsters come with a base  resistance to debuffs debuffs sometimes will get resisted. Accuracy helps negate your effects being resisted.. yeah arena rewards is shitty. I think its their way of trying to compensate with the arena rivals. Someone once did a calculation and completely fp players should make around  crystals per week give or take so not really terrible..PW Well not really. This game is the least pw game ive played ever on mobile. With the abysmal summoning rates Ive actually spent around  with no natural stars while ive seen many fp players with . Yeah paying helps you get s easier with the large amount of fodder it gives but thats about it. You only really need  s for arena anyways so its really not that big of a deal of pw. In this game like most other games you just pay to mainly save time but without the other benefits like clash of clans the VIP systems in most asian mobile games and the increased better mobs. you can literally beat any arena matchup with  ramagos. I challenge you to tell me a defense team that can withstand  ramagos with that stupid retarded AI.. ehh its not that big of a deal having filler in there. . Yeah AI is dumb and stupid but well see how they handle this and improve in the future. If the AI was smarter it works both ways you would get wrecked by dungeons.,summonerswar,clf4spn,1,t5_324pd

OTOH I had some fail matchups where the opponents Megan is super fast but after the ATB boost the rest of her squad is only  through their bar always happen on nonspeed leaders usually its some random nat  where theyre obliged to put it on lead,summonerswar,clsf6mx,1,t5_324pd

This gives her the benefit of procing her passive even if she lands a glancing hit. With the warbear if they land a glancing hit then the ATB reduction doesnt apply.

She can solo Faimon too which is good for leveling.Samurais supposedly hit really hard but I dont have much experience with them.Mystic Witch is a great buffer for arena get her speed high and she will serve you well.Garuda is a great healersustainer for dungeons and ToA.Inferno is used for an imps team to beat higher level Giants dungeons.Ninja is a pretty good damager for arena.Rest are food.FireInugami is a good fire attacker if you dont have anything better but you do and is great for leveling fodders.  He can also solo Faimon  and is preferred for leveling since he can clear the stage a lot faster.I think fire LA is a pretty good attacker but Im not experienced with him at all.Sylph is a pretty good AoE attacker and a speed leader.  Hes considered the worst of the Sylphs but people still use him and love him.  Hes good for arena and dungeons as well.You have a fire Epikion!  So jealous!  Her third skill is killer.  Shes a beast in the arena most highranking teams use her.Viking is basically a onetrick pony used for Dragons B.Aw man you have a fire Vamp too?  Nice.  Hes considered a beast and rightly so.  Awaken him ASAP and get his crit high.Hellhound can be used for an imp team instead of the water Inferno.The rest arent anything to write home about.WindAs I think you can tell by the fact that youve  him Ramagos is pretty sweet.  That Clean Shot.As I said before Samurais can hit pretty hard but I dont know that much about them.Wind Living Armor can do crazy damage when you rune him up right!  Get that defense up and be amazed.Griffon is great for speed teams in the arena that speed buff is pretty awesome.Rest are fodder.LightLight imp can hit pretty hard but dies too easily IMO.That invincibility buff on the fairy is great.  Since you have Chloe Id suggest using the fairy for your imps team and Chloe for the arena.Bearman is fantastic if you get that crit rate and hp high.Inu is a great healersupport for ToA.DarkBoth of your dark units arent anything to write home about sorry Hope this helped!,summonerswar,cm58d22,1,t5_324pd

2424149,0,t1_cmbbl96,Fire Sylph is indeed a useful unit due to his third skill and leader skill. Continuous damage is very useful especially against high HP units in higher level of ToA for example and seeing you didnt have a better speed leader on your team you should go for Fire Sylph. He can be runed with Despair  Focus for added stun effect and maybe it is the best rune setup for him. Regarding Water Phoenix he is a SLOW unit  base speed is slow compare that to the Fire and Wind counterpart with  base speed.Sigmaruss Attack stat is really high though in my opinion he works best on a long fight dragout fight rune setup in my mind has been Violent  Blade with AtkAtkAtk and get as much Atk Speed amp CritRate from substats.I am biased towards fusing a water phoenix currently planning to get him next and thus I suggest you make one and Fire Sylph that should help you go through some harder dungeons.Any further questions are welcome good luck!,summonerswar,cmbbzhs,2,t5_324pd

2425066,0,t1_cmbfypl,I am guessing you dont run B Giants as much as real Giant farmers do Im not dissing you here just stating my assumptions. Cause not only are Despair runes common those stats are extremely common and I have a lot of spares with Atk HP Acc and Crit Rate.Aaaaaaand only one substat will increase to that amount if the user is that lucky actually you dont need to be that lucky since its only a  chance to get both increments on a single stat as it is just a rare rune.If you are talking about good runes  would suit a rare rarity well. But this is a  rune whereby the rarity colour of the rune plays so much of a bigger deal to improve on the substats.Read this as many times as you need to understand.EDIT forgot to mention that the OP got  attack on the rune which is great. Really lucky on his part with the average . increment per powerup. But it is just a rare rune which is  chance to get from a Giant. No big deal.,summonerswar,cmbg1yl,-1,t5_324pd

Such high ATK the ideal is surely go full damage  But then dat speed so low... So at first I tried to make him go full damage No SPD at all with shitty runes cant killmake big damage in anyone in only one turn yet so slow and squishy that he likely died before making next turn... Then I give slot  for SPD dang the damage become so lil... yet works better than before. Now I give him SwiftBlade atk cri dmg atk. The only  is one atk... TvT  I swapped to Swift after getting good swift rune and when I play to my friends island turn out he has Sigmarus too and give him Swift tooSo then I conclude that if I cant give him godly rune yet to support that high atk better sacrifice some damage for speed because hes slow and squishy and Im enough with him killed before doing something notable .,summonerswar,cmfe0da,3,t5_324pd

For an allaround PvE team here is my suggestion but honestly you have a lot to choose from Megan swappable with a healer like Bella Neal or whatever also swappable with Wind Occult depending on situation. Water Werewolf Ahman Fire DK Ramagos for  monster setupsRamagos is a poor mans way of clearing ToA tied with Neal. So you may want to invest into him if youre not into spending too much money.For PvP you should probably go the following Wind Occult Girl  Over k health Wind DK Ahman Belladeon  Fast and tanky one  over k health and k defense needed.  spd,summonerswar,cmrcr25,1,t5_324pd

2557261,0,t1_cmsck7u,. AO is whatever gets you the win i suggest eventually getting a speed lead as you get better runes on megan to ensure a first turn then julie  aoe to just burst as much and kill as many as possible st turn. . Reason being is your megan is slow so any speed team will win against you since that entire team is pretty much one shot u cant do much about this because everything up to conquerer  rank is pretty much win all AO lose all AD. Suggestions would be Darion Acasis Belladeon and Chloe. Or replace belladeon with Ahman i prefer bella for his dispel.. youre better off making y our chloe having a lower CD shield OR making your julie stronger. The shield for acasis is the same just lower CD so its not  necessary since u have a chloe to make up for a turn with fanatic.. Its not that difficult to rune ideally  spd  on bernard  shannon  hp rune on th acc or HP or even def  on th will be fine. As for replacement...probably megan? Its just that the glance as well as speed debuff is really useful against the giant.,summonerswar,cmsde1l,1,t5_324pd

2606860,0,t3_2ppdkh,Conq  to Guardian  is when you will start seeing more nonspeed teams. Conq  speed teams are still there but theyre often CC heavy instead of burst heavy.To fight with speed teams without a chloe or a speed leader for FP youre going to need an all  star and a good amount of HP  star runes. The team is normally something like. A tanky reviver or a tanky support so your opponent must open fire on them. Darion light vagabond could fit in this nicely and hes possibly the only mob in the farmable range that can do so since the revive units you can farm are so poor. Hes very popular for users with bad revivers. For reviver If you have Wind DK or anything better it would be nice. Water Undine cannot fit in because shes water and will be easily killed by Lushen.. A healer with runes strong enough to survive at least one lushens buffed attack. Light bearman can fill this rule if you use Darion and you have good runes. If you have Chloe Ariel etc then theyre better for this rule.. A tanky hko unit or a tanky AOE CC that can cause trouble to your opponents. This is Arnolds rule but if you dont have it the only thing in the farmable range is Copper. Its hard to find meaningful AOE in  stars and in  stars most AOE units are squishy but  stars like Aria Julien Tyron etc can be great help. These  types of units can slowly wear your opponent down even if the tower cannot. The CC units have to have alot of HP to survive.. The final unit highly depend on what you have. You can throw in a CC if your healer is strong enough or if you have a good CC then maybe throw in another reviver.. Avoid water units unless its a good nat and with at least k HP because theyre going to be hko by many lushenkatshimitaejuliencopper teams. Water units are mainly there for CC but theyre better in Speed CC and Speed Burst teams than tanky teams.. A typical team is the full light team Aria Leader  Ahman  Darion  rezzer or AOE CC. There are more farmable teams that can reach this part of the arena with insanely good runes and these teams has mainly Darion and also rare units like Dark Yeti IMO good dark yeti with vamp runes are insanely hard to kill.With a tanky team you are more vulnerable to sustain burst teams like Speed  Megan  Light bearman  Copper or Wind Vamp  Acasis teams but you will get attacked far less by burst teams which is wayyy more popular.I personally run speed at Conq  but top guild members of mine run simple sustain  CC teams at guardian  and I was able to try their team since were all IRL friends. Its slow but fun to play with and can do well against burst CC teams.,summonerswar,cmyur9k,1,t5_324pd

Make sure you bring at least  healer though if you intend to absorb dmg from their fire monsters.You may also notice that most players recommend to first build your support monsters your dungeon teams to clear halls rather than building on specific monsters that you have.

It would also be good to get a wind griffon and awaken to Bernard. You can farm him in the storyline map. Lastly you need a little better healer than water howl. Ahmen is recommended but if too hard to find the SD then keep an eye out for wind yeti. His heal is outrageous.

2681258,0,t1_cn8d6ik,Im going to analyse your monsters that you dont seem to be prioritizing at the moment instead of only . In order Your main monsters as damage dealer at the moment seems to be Water Martial Cat and Wind Vampire. Water Martial Cat is pretty weak on stats and completly antagonic paired with your Vampire. Youre desperatly needing damage dealers so I would recommend you start focusing on your Fire Inugami since he is a great option on this regard and he will boost your progress in the game by a lot farming in faimon . If you dont pull any better nat  damage dealer I would recommend highly him to be your first  You have other options as your wind rakshasa should be work marvelous with your Wind Vamp against bosses specially  B giant. My only worry on this is that your main monsters get too restrict to one element since... ... as supports your best duo to perform is ShannonWind PixieBernardWind Gryphon both being also Wind element units. These two provides you everything you want on a basic situationno heal bomb nor invincibility ATKDEFSPD Buff and GlancingATKDEFFSPDAoE debuff! AcasisWind Sylphid is also amazing supporting and she has great Atk stat. Honestly I would recommend you go ShannonAcasis right now but you definitely should keep all three. As PvP content you have two amazing water units MeganWater Witch and Water Tails. Megan is a core of big part of speed AD line ups buffing her team before the enemy team plays. Tails counters heavily Chloe which you will find pretty annoying on arena specially on later stages.Ramagos is great for AO not so much on AD since you can easily ignore him for last. I personally think Water Priest is useless. Taking this in mind I would recommend you to store your priests to later on skill power up a possible ChloeFire Priest. Keep all fusion materials specially Martial Cat. Notable mention  You can also choose betwen inferno and grim reaper as a AoE damage dealer runed with despair. Inferno has godly atk stats but he is even squishier than Grim Reaper. I dont have many  experience on ToA so I cant tell you which debuff would be better but in PvP I think Grim Reaper looks definitely stronger.  Notable Mention  Lulu will keep being useful for you even later on keep her. About Teon I really dont know if he is worth keeping his revive dont amuse me at all. Since hes a light mon I dont recommend dumping him. Same goes for your Dark Witch but to me she really looks interesting just cant tell you exactly how I would rune her.,summonerswar,cn8k78h,1,t5_324pd

2754993,0,t1_cnh87o6,Thanks for your reply well my Ramagos is already K hp. However I still cant seem to beat TOA  which is only half way to . My main question was I think my arena defense is acceptable at the moment but are any of the monsters I also mentioned worth paying attention to for Arena or Toa.For example I heard that Water Vamp is not that good and also Wind Vamp is not really special. However wind Rak can be good but is she worth leveling since I already have fire Rak and Orochi which kinda of do the same? It seems that Fire undine is fodder and that wind lich is also not brilliant. He can be okay I read when awakened but that is a lot of work for I monster I might not use that often.Finally still wondering if it is worth to Awaken and level the water samurai and water tails since I dont have any good water monsters. However I have great fire and wind monsters so they will be only usefull against strong fire teams in ToaArena which is like a niche.Happy to see your reply,summonerswar,cnh8bop,1,t5_324pd

His cleanse is good and extra heal is awesome too. He is good til late game Id say.Konimiya is awesome. I made my kona later in the game and he basically replaced my lulu. His cleanse is far superior as well because it removes all status effects not just one like lulu. His resurge is also really useful. Go swift energy with hp for survivability on this guy.Who I would recommend both. Lulu will serve you well when you are in heavy healing situations and kona is great for fire dungeon and trial of ascension.

2872984,0,t3_2t08p3,A few comments if you could explain Living armor. I dont think this dude deserves a  for late game. Other than his burst rd skill he doesnt do too much in anywhere other than AO and his glancing hit chances against the fire meta really affects his utility in AOAD. In DG and TOA there are loads of other attackers mainly DOT dealers whom outclasses him for the DPS role so I dont get why hes a  in DG as well. Light Imp. This and wind living armor seems to indicate that you strongly prefer and rate monsters with strong burst for guardian level defenses though you dislike katarina. He does have a strong ignore defense burst but i feel that hes too frail to deserve a  in end game especially for stuff like AD and TOA unless your end game rating is based on AO. His only use is in AO where his light typing allows him to avoid attacks and I dont think he deserves a  for endgame based on arena prowess only unless that was your intention  Ahman. Even though ahman is outclassed by chasum I still feel he should be a  as hes somewhat obtainable for most of us and is still considered a staple unit for most of our end game DG runs. Not so useful in arena though Tyron. Im a supporter of raising him up to  as his end game build is mostly CC support runed for despairfocus. This makes him probably the best CCer in the game bar some nat  like verad and is immensely useful in DGTOA though I understand he may not find guardian arena welcoming due to choles velas and other immunity stuff. Also because water nat  doesnt have anything rated for  P Wind ninja. Ive heard many comments that he falls off drastically late game. I know he doesnt do too well in arena with fire meta and his usefulness in TOA is limited to nonboss stages and hence I cant really understand why he gets a  for late game unless you recommend using him in a wind team with wind griffon shannon etc or if theres some guardian level stuff going on with him that Im missing out Wind sylph. He doesnt one shot any target in late game arena and his CC is weaker than tyron. Only saving grace is his leader skill which adds  over tyronbaretta in arena which is sadly quite insignificant in end game chole ADs. Is he really that strong in guardian PVP? In DGTOA tyron and baretta are much more useful then him Some  stars like the beast monks are crap. If any nat  deserves a  its them JK,summonerswar,cnunqjb,3,t5_324pd

Or you could revive BelladeonLumi if they have their heal cooltime at full and heal up. But other than that the second ability isnt very powerful. On Mikene I rarely use it. I wish the first skill had something different than glancing. I really like glancing hit but I already have a few units that do that reliably.

Then shannon because she can be squishy.Arena you can go wind griffon shannon lushen and water undine your griffon has to get the first turn so you can speed buff your team next should be shannon for the buff and then lushen to aoe shot the enemy team. idk much about water undine but she seems goodedit i saw that you also have water  tails so you should use her instead of undine in AO.

2920692,0,t1_co02zc5,You are pretty incorrect about Lagmaron. He has the following advantages  HP for wind monsters His auto attack has dot so it helps killing giant faster AoE attack with attack debuff help clear trash monsters faster. He can help debuff giant in case Bernard fails Stun chance helps. Its like ppl putting despair on Acasis and Shannon to hope for  chance of stunning Decent dpsI would run the following team for B Lagmaron lead Acasis Shannon Bernard Orochiwind healer Wind E.PriestAhmanBelladeonI am not considering those two units for core team Sigmarus its squishiness and being water element. It is easily focused by all the golems and RNG can screw you up badly. Furthermore his base HP is pathetic so even with HP bonus from leadership its survivability is questionable. Orochi he is actually pretty good for giant b. I am running Orochi team myself. However lack of AoE damage so he doesnt help much in clearing trash monsters. Moreover because he has high base HP but extremely low defense and he is hitting  times with rd skill  star Orochi is oneshot candidate at boss stage. Even my Orochi at  star with k HP he could be one shotted if Orochi has defense debuff and giant has attack buff.OP already had Lagmaron at  so it will be a better choice. However if OP feels there is enough sustain small heal from Acasis Orochi can be added in to kill giant even faster.,summonerswar,co03b9h,2,t5_324pd

2938971,0,t3_2ttdoi,b has been theorized and somewhat experimentally shown by some of the korean players who keep track of their drops to drop about  six star runes. b about  six star runes. b about  six star runes. So yes its certainly not a bad idea to farm b or b instead if you absolutely cant do b.Personally Ive actually beaten the dragons b boss with just a  Megan and  Lulu. The problem though is that its manual and you have to get them to the boss which might be harder than the actual boss. Honestly runes from the dragons are post end game content and arent actually required for anything. Dont get me wrong they are great runes but only absolutely required for high tier arena and even then Im mostly referring to violent and will runesets. Runes from giants are more than enough to beat ToA HoH all the dungeons and get you very far in arena. Also Id highly recommend only farming giants OR dragons at a time cuz your rune inventory will fill up extremely fast and its better to have complete  sets of a couple runesets vs incomplete sets of many runesets.,summonerswar,co269y0,7,t5_324pd

Leo  nukers has the potential to decimate just about everything.  TOA would be pure impossible with this.  Leos team with the double Verdes would get multiple turns before anyone from your team gets a single turn... which means game over.The bug right now isnt really a bug.  Its in effect... but whoever goes first in the fight is based off of what their base speed is.  However everyone still has  speed... which means a  speed Chloe will go first but she will not get her usual x turns before a slower  speed monster moves.

2978550,0,t1_co6o5s7,Thanks for the response. My verdehwa are the only mons that i have who are on   runes so I feel that theyre atm theyre my best chance of getting higher up. Using baretta as speed leader would make my team really fast although then i would be using  dps fire mons which would probably suck on defense. I usually get Acasis her shield up before the enemy attacks but i guess on defense it doesnt do that much good. Might try swapping her out for bella once ive runeded her. The extra heal buff removal and especially armor break might work out on D. Tbh I think briand is kinda worthless in my team setting and i regret ing him. ,summonerswar,co6ode9,1,t5_324pd

3064654,0,t1_cofkv60,Definitely save for the  pack!  FP here as well. For your second week of play I think you are doing well  you already have a Rina  who can farm Faimon eventually and is pretty useful in AD.  SD are very useful  especially the light ones.  See  for the list.     Light inugami vagabond fairy and bearman are all very much in demand  I use all by my fairy heavily and inuvagabearman figure into many many PVE teams.   Theres nothing you really need from dark SD.  Hellhound and yeti have their uses. From water you want garuda howl and maybe bearman for undine fusion and werewolf decent earlymid game monster all around.     From Fire Harpu is OK as are Yeti and Magic Archer.  Fire werewolf is used for Fire Joker fusion.   From wind you want Pixie ASAP.  She is in many many PVE teams and is just really helpful  and easy to max skill too!  You also want warbear hes a good mob in general and can farm Hydeni Hell  cheaply.  I wouldnt suggest  starring your amazon as your first though I did mine and she was disappointing.  Re fire inugami drop rate Its INCREDIBLY low.  Ive been farming normal faimon forever and never seen one drop  I got mine from a mystic scroll.,summonerswar,cofnct0,1,t5_324pd

3074848,0,t3_2vd085,This is actually the same AO Ive used that brought me to Conqueror. I had a TyronShimitae lead Megan for speed and atk boost Velajuel because... Velajuel xP and Liebli for AOE damage and Liebli is still a permanent member of my AO and Im currently in Guardian .However you have to be really careful with this comp. As other people have said anyone with immunity a Will set or dispel buff would ruin your entire attack and the unfortunate thing about entering any battle is that you dont know what rune setattributes the opposing monsters will have. Every unit might have Will runes and in this case your Tyron and bombs are ineffective. If you dont know what stats certain units possess you wont know when to bring Aquila. In addition the issue with these nukers is that theyre incredibly squishy duh!. If you face an AD with an attacker of the opposite element of your attackers then theyre going to be gone the immediate turn without even casting their bombs. Lastly in the higher arena more and more monsters will be built with Resist so your  Acc wont even be able to do its job I would know. I have an  Acc Praha who fails to cast DOTs at what seems like the  vast majority of the time .The good thing is units in the lower arena wont be runed well enough to handle a Tyron with high accuracy and most wont even be able to  shot your nukers. However know that youre going to hit a wall at some point during your climb and once youre there you might have to sacrifice one bombusingnuker to use its slot to build a supporting team surrounding your better bomber.

He is great midgame whether hes runed for PvE Crit and Accuracy or PvP Crit and Crit Damage. He has versatile builds again I dont know what runes you have on him and can even be runed with Swift as well.Soha to me is just an antiChloeBuff in PvP she can provide damage but it pales in comparison to Orochi with his DoTs.,summonerswar,coqim7a,1,t5_324pd

Also ads targeted normally through your personal information.Also if you have a problem with this model  why do you play this game? You can literally just drop this game and never come back to it. Games like DotA  for example have only cosmetic items for real money. League of Legends a game I play could be argued for and Hearthstone argued a little less for. I spent money on both league of legends and hearthstone about  total but Im happy because the devs are good and care about their players but I digress.

You might be right about them not being able to b I was just able to do it with them all level  so their stats would def be higher leveled up all the way but I had to use gems  or  times to beat it aswell as using a friends wind pheonix so idk even if they maxed level if it would be farmable BUT on the bright side from the light and dark scroll for completing it I got a Light bearman which i have been trying to get desperatly for a month so yay so maybe I can factor him into some of these dungeons or TOA maybe more dungeons since toa seems to be more about nuking.

3268232,0,t3_2xjxax,His ATK power is decent. I think its about  at level . But he doesnt have a very big damage modifier so it doesnt feel like  attack at all.His CD are huge. It takes him a long time to get them back and while hes doing that hes not doing anything useful. Barely doing damage either unless fully loaded up with a lot of good rage runes for his first skill.You need accuracy to make the second and third skill work and the second one is a  chance for each attack. You will more often than not not get one of them to proc at all. The accuracy needed to make sure his third skill hits is taking away from damage which means he spends more time doing nothing with his long cooldowns or he does decent damage with his first attack but his second becomes completely useless and his third becomes meh.He sounds great on paper but unless his second skill is a  turn cooldown its mostly useless even with despair runes. He will get both attacks off once then die. In PvE you will be waiting on him to do something for a long time.,summonerswar,cp0szvf,1,t5_324pd

Using Swift however is not a mistake because it keeps up consistent turn pacing.The best thing you can do is well simply put just try it out. Youll be in a better position to see whats happening and potentially whats going wrong through observation instead of asking people if its possible or not without them knowing the more important factors specifically your runes.If a monster is constantly getting instagibbed then find out why. Crystals armor breaking Michelle then Zaiross killing her? Get more resistance. Juno not cleansing effectively? Maybe you have too much resistance and not enough speed. Dying to the boss sub  hp?

3458288,0,t3_2zur87,Im FP like you. I havent been playing anywhere near as long maybe a week and a half but ive been playing FP games for a long time so I know the ruts.I followed the advice of saving my first  crystals to buy the premium pack and my pull was a handful of martial cats and that was crushingly disappointing when you look around and see most of the beginner guides go with the base assumption that you get at least something good.My damage source for a majority of the time was the fire hellhound you start out with and anything I summoned tended to be more and more healers or tanks. Nothing was more fun than waiting through runs with  healers and a tank zzzzz.The only way you get through is with patience. You have to decide if you like the game and understand that if youre trying to minmax shelling out money doesnt guarantee the scrolls you get with money will get you anything good. All you need to do is watch that Youtube video episode  some guy posted here earlier today of doing his premium pack summon of nothing good and then imagine how you would feel if you sank real money and bought x number of premium packs with it and still ended up with nothing to show for it except less real money.I lucked out with some good friend accepts this all elements dungeon event and was able to finish out a Belladeon and Ahman so I have something to build on. And thats what you have to do. To set a small goal and build towards it. The SDs offer several accessible monsters that are worth picking up for FPs that you dont have an excuse not to have.The fact you have a Lushen is miles better than anything I have. My highest quality monster is a Water Pioneer Woosa and the last time I saw lightning on a MS was an awakened lizardman Kernodon.I really dont see what the benefits of doing the reset thing is. Maybe im missing something that someone isnt explaining it to me well enough why id want to waste the  weeks ive already sunk in to do it all over again for no guarantees id get anything good over and over again.,summonerswar,cpmgxxr,2,t5_324pd

I experimented with violent also when he was updated. So he could use scratch hitting defense debuff then violent proc into Scar. That build was SPDATTACC. It would hit for over K with a crit but generally it was just amusing to watch. It didnt do a lot. It did however drop Giants B really really fast with all the  turn DoTs he would apply.

3525803,0,t3_30nvb6,It seems more like they just want to test their program against the system. There is no benefit for them to announce they powered up a rune to Lv. etc. All it does is show that they can hackmod the game. Theyre doing it purely to show off that they can and probably get people to respond to what theyre doing. So theyre likely doing it for attention not because they care to get strong or overpowered.Also  s at low levels could just be people with money. I wouldnt be so quick to judge someone who is just low level with lots of nat s as a hacker.However if a level  enters ConquerorGuardian arena with bad runes on all their monsters and all their monsters look bad then they did it for power. In any case the best people can do is just report them and get them banned.

Wind Undine will always have her immunity down more than its up whereas Veromos will actually remove effects every turn. They arent even close. Wind Undine is completely niche where you can end the battle while her immunity is up otherwise its at best up  of every  turns unless someone is violent and or faster than her on the team then its up less. When you get one i guarantee it will be in storage until you can feed it within a few weeks. and you will have wasted a great HOH opp for the rest of us. Her slow requires crit and acc also for shock so if you rune her for any form of CC you immediately need to do crit on a monster that couldnt damage a puppy and acc for one ability that hits one monster and has limited uptime. You end up with a squishy slow monster.

I use him to farm Faimon Hell as well as part of my main team. His leader skill gives  ATK to everyone no dungeon or arena bullshit so thats fantastic. His st skill stuns at  chance when the skill is maxed out and this is perfect if runed Revenge since youre bound to stun a momster eventually. The AoE is really great because it decrease ATB and if runed Vampire its a really op way to get HP back when you have multiple monsters. Alas the third skill is really nice and helps sustain because it does X limes and turn invincibility..

Pushed all the way to rank  before we started facing extremely good guilds and they got the idea. After that we coasted through the Conq  rank and finished at Conq . This week everyone set their shitty defenses early and although we lost the first offense our rating has stayed down and knock on wood the rest of our battles have been very easy. Our battle log has five records of being attacked so it seems to happen pretty often. The funny part is even at  rating were still a Fighter  guild.

Im assuming you can do about BBish. Bring lots of DoT monsters such as Megan your Grim Reaper etc. and it should go by fairly quickly. I pulled a  around level ish and it took me foreverrrr to farm Highs. If you get no drops than try running magic dungeon to farm Mids and you may have a chance of getting  different Highs and Mids.

3674341,0,t1_cqayuz0,Like what Timodar said up there Darion is still better than Dias even outside of Giants. He pointed most stuff out but Ill chime in on the type of monster.  Dias is a Defense monster generally has more defense compare to HP and its bad for business. Defense break and ignore defense monster is everywhere Bella being one of the common one.  Darion is a HP mon defense break still affects him but not as much and his first skill is based off HP makes him hit hard and tank at the same time.One plus Dias has over Darion is the crit reduction but there is always DOTs to take care of them both.,summonerswar,cqb3kod,1,t5_324pd

3675045,0,t3_32gmf6,Hey all! Yet another request from me.Part  and Part  of my box. Pretty much just spending most of my time leveling and gathering mana. Thoughts on which monsters I should level next? Ill be hopefully doing some more awakening this week I have a TON of energy stored in my inbox from the Cherry Blossom event so Im more just looking who I should work up to max level and then  or  star. Im just mildly overwhelmed with the number of monsters Ive gotten lately and not sure who to prioritize based on what I already have.Any help would as always be greatly appreciated!,summonerswar,cqb6gm4,1,t5_324pd
3675201,0,t1_cqb6vlg,I have Malaka with decent runes so he can usually solo faimon hard although he does get the random failure from time to time since he is a bit squishy. I have him runed fatalfocus spdattatt. To make sure he passes  of the time I usually have to run him  a non maxed  person to help out. I figure its pretty much the same  im still using the experience from  of my slots.

Im currently using Rama to solo farm Hydeni Hell.Any advice on what steps I should be taking past Kona?  Should I put work into someone else as a farmer?

3743390,0,t3_33a3sx,Dartan has a very good post for you. A quick and Dirty guide that I follow for who to  is based on the fact that you only get HP ATK and DEF by levels for your mons. So if the mons skills benefit from having more HPATKDEF like Ahmans heal you may want to prioritze it more than say a Shannon who just gets the ability to survive longer If its all the same you should check the mons you are using a check their total HP and DEF and whoever is the weakest should  so they can survive longer in fights.,summonerswar,cqiyz6b,1,t5_324pd

3747054,0,t1_cqjciqp,Haha yea some monsters just escape you. I first pulled a rina only like  months into the game and its only a  monster. For all the many pulls ive gotten a few nat s still elude me like chasun lushen and arnold.I guess what you have is a water beast monk chandra? His kit is aligned to hp making him a water tank. Defend is good in both AO and AD PVE as well since it helps to divert damage away from the one getting focused down. rd skill aoe reduction in attk speed is good. st skill stuns scales of hp crits and get increased speed means you dont have to rune him for speed he will naturally be faster as long as you crit.Lastly since he is water based fire meta in arena prevents him from being focused by AI and crits are easier.Base hp is very high at k he can hit k hp with end game runes. If you can get good runes for him he can be used everywhere.Just saw this thread on tarans AD with chandra you can take a look.,summonerswar,cqje18s,1,t5_324pd

I basically lived in faimon normal for the whole event and ended around .  This event is no different.  I am in the high s farming normal maps I am not playing nonstop like some of these other guys but at this rate I will complete the event well ahead of time.  Drop rate feels the same.

3824395,0,t1_cqs69ji,Ignoring armor break and ignore defense its totally true. The error you made is that you are thinking in  instead of stats. In the end it is not the  gain but the final stats that matter.If you ever try hitting monsters with very high defense you will see everything hits ridiculously low without armor break. Particularly skills with high mutlipliers this is where you get the most benefit out of defense. One reason why lumi does so well with defense stats against the dragon the multipier is quite high when dots stack and defense mitigates the damage very effectively.This doesnt mean that you shouldnt apply hp just that monster with very high defense stats vs hp benefit alot more from defense . But of course even if ignore defense and armor break doesnt exist you would need to balance the two out due to diminishing returns on stacking too heavily on one stat.,summonerswar,cqs7pdr,1,t5_324pd

He finds uses in arenaguild wars mostly when I need a good tank or damage sponge. His third skill is awesome and really wrecks other tanks but thats honestly not why I bring him. He just refuses to die most times. And with his skill  atb knockback and provoke he helps keep the heat off my softer monsters. By knowing that hes light I can take advantage of that by careful element manipulation. Enemy has  water tanks and  Perna? I can safely bring  big water damagers and Marble. I run mine energy x now because thats what I have. Eventually though I want to get a set of revenge runes on him. With that Im torn between revengeenergyx with hpcritDhp  or revengevampire with all hp.

3920695,0,t3_35cedf,Delphoi LD  Shannon  Bernard  Rakaja  Jultan or Vigor.I would not use your Suri or Gamir to be honest use them as eventual food for a  star unless they become fusion beforehand. That group would be able to easily and safely man the place without either one of them anyway especially once they were made  stars and all of them deserve that.Of your mons going past wind anything that would be treated as neutral in the place Jultan is your best. Hes more for PVP but at least hed be a mon you wouldnt regret putting time into. He has a very fun design IMO. Additionally the fact hed be neutral and golems would go after him would be fine as hes built like a tank with the hp on his abilities. He wont be getting the leadership skill but thats fine. Youd prefer a wind for a th but for right now he at least wouldnt hurt you putting more mons into. I dont know much about the Dark BH you have but he at least has rarity on his side. Never would feel too bad putting stuff into a LampD that isnt from a SD even if their current skills suck fun trophy to play with.Vigor is great with the buffs he received so hed also be a reasonable choice over Jultan. I wouldnt really take Dagorra right now. That group wouldnt need a tank for B and Dagorra is just a wall. I think the water mammoth does that specific job better and while it can be a farmer with crappy runes its... slow and Ramagos fills the slow tank farmer role already. Its handy to have at least  walls for say secret dungeon farming. Sometimes one pops up you need skillups from. Having at least  makes for easy group design   tank thats neutral or weak to the SD and  mons thatre strong or a mix of strong and neutral depending on if the tanks matched or weak to the dungeon. Once your tanks big enough it can handle the place with minimal support maybe a single pure healer like Lulu or one with more group perks like Chasun or Colleens atk buff or instead of a healer someone helping slow or def buff like Shannon thats also giving an atk buff and your group can be tank  MAYBE healer or support   dps. Eventually you could just zerg the place but thats a lot farther off than beating floor  or  reliably using the tank method.Incidentally until that th mon is prepped Ramagos would be fine for throwing into the group as a safety net. Hed probably win even if the rest of the party dropped dead B really doesnt hit hard.,summonerswar,cr371ly,1,t5_324pd

3931832,0,t1_cr4g465,Thanks for the informative reply it sure helps.For skill ups its a huge gamble seeing how my Sig still needs one each for skill amp and  more for rd skill. Skill up Vero is probably more helpful in Giants makes invesment on Delphoi a real pain. I can only do Dragons B reliably so no access to violent runes either and im on a shortage on Swifts.Im comparing Shannon with Luer because Im thinking of the DespairFocus SPDHPACC runeset for luer more on the AOE stun area and possibly be useful on floors like the current . But he dont seem to be a significant improvement overall. My current wipes are mainly caused by deaths of Vero and Bella because the lack of HP runes Bernard survives well even on crap runes but him being   may just cover the weakness I currently have. Im interested about what you said about Darion though I cant find him a place currently mainly because of runes. Where does Darion shine?,summonerswar,cr4gpzb,1,t5_324pd

3940337,0,t1_cr5f47m,This is actually a very good point. Its usually easier to get  extra crit from substats than it is to get   extra accuracy. It of course depends on what runes you already have. But sometimes you can get  total from stray substats on  runes that were never intended as proper cr runes. From a more end game perspective when a monster has  crit bonus and a blade set thats . To get  its just  more and to get  its just  more both achievable through substats. In reality you usually aim for  if you also use a crit rate buffer which adds . That is why end game you pretty much always see the attackcrit damageattack build on top damage dealers.,summonerswar,cr5fkga,1,t5_324pd

You should then focus on a giant team fuse a Barettafire slyphLight Vagabond get a Wind Griffon level up your Light Inugami Wind Pixie Water Garuda and s all of them I can do mine all s on giant b auto  if AI works like it should and to farm for runes.Dont really try too hard getting a s at this point.

3950858,0,t1_cr6cbrk,And then you realize that hes on violentrevenge and he taunts amp armor breaks your BellaDarionwhoever. They both are strong monsters I truly believe Jubelle is better solely because he can keep an attacker taunted. Jubelle is much harder to counter because whoever you use to tank him will be reduced to only using their first skill which means you cant use Bella which leaves your darion to armor break for your team.,summonerswar,cr6mr1s,2,t5_324pd
3952928,0,t1_cr6qtov,IMO yes its easy for farming with Dagora but its not very useful outside of it. If you want ONLY farming for your first six then go ahead and do it but it will drag you in other parts of the game. Lumi is great for dungeons although shes a slow soloer she can solo dragon and she provides more than just tanking in GWArena so shes a better pick than Dagora for your first six IMO. However Soha is a even better package overall. You dont have to solo Hell  immediately. Hard  can be very handy for a long time. Also once you have the runes ready for your Soha to solo Faimon Hell  she solos it extremely fast like you said. IMO speed is everything simply because you can save alot of crystals with your boosters and get your next six up relatively easy. Plus altho soha isnt as good as Lumi for dungeons and arena she is a fine DD for SD and come Conq arena when you have more and more fire heavy  teams on your list.  Since you have your light trio ready its better to get a DD up and running instead of a tank.My vote goes to Soha for these reasons.,summonerswar,cr6v8ic,1,t5_324pd

3963146,0,t1_cr7bwza,True but still a valid point for the OP.  A benefit of choosing Soha is that she is beneficial in AO.

4025643,0,t3_36m95v,I run the exact same team.Here are my thoughtsBella is fine. Mine has a bit less Acc and a bit more HP.Veromos could have more Acc but he should be doing fine.Acasis could have a bit more Acc but she should be fine as well.Bernard has low HP even though mine has only  more and works fine even tho he is the first to die when things really go south his Acc is ok but could be a bit higher. You really need his Att debuff.Shannon is most likely your aquiles heel Her accuracy is really bad Her HP is kinda low and her defense is not enough as well. If you cant get better runes Id star her.TLDR Your Shannon is your weak point. Either get better runes or star her.,summonerswar,crf5ilk,1,t5_324pd
4026103,0,t1_crf6phz,Same here. I build her just because she was my first Nat  I ever pulled from scroll and because it took me less then a day to do so. I build her YOLO cause I do not need just another support. She is very powerful on paper but really hard to pull off. For example I remove Chloe buffs and then Veromos stuns half of my team so I need to wait one more turn to get my combo going. Now I use her like  fights where she is ok. I used her together with Tessarion against Camilla Perna Darion Chloe AD and did OK yestedray.

I mean Copper does massive damage while being extremely tanky as well just on default ofc hes not tanky vs ignore def and armor break but thats another caseIf one doesnt have armor break or ignore defense monsters like Copper would be at the top of everything thats why I think armor break is balanced in its own aspect. There are also ways to counter it and armor break needs to be followed up upon where violent comes into play. Ofc I do understand where youre coming from how it makes a giant difference. That being said I dont think its as huge of an issue as a single monster going  times multiple turns in a row. Theres just no way to counter that. Perhaps I am being a bit biased though as I rely armor break and dont have a single violent runed monster. shocker! ,summonerswar,crhzxbc,1,t5_324pd

4095501,0,t3_37io99,First off it would be a good practice to have your monsters sorted by grade when you post your box. There might be more hidden gems there that we are not seeing. For Giants b I would go with Ahman Bella Shannon Bernard and either an HP lead Sigmarus or Veromos Speed Orochi but use the speed lead when you have an already stable Giants team and you want to speed up your farming. For Dragons B Hwa will come in handy as well as Baretta. Thats all I can suggest given your box.Hwa is really good for her passive. Paired with Verdehile you can prevent the enemy from getting a turn.Continue with Ahman he really helps in ToA and hes a reliable healer with the right setup but work on Bella as well.Any CC DoT team with Pang is good.

Speed nuke comps really only work with Sig as the Water DPS. As mentioned by the other guy Sig has  skills with high damage and utility. Depending on what point you are at in the game fusing a Sig just for more efficient D farming is not a terrible idea. If you have other needs at this time and are able to run D it may not be a priority.

His nd is also nice to keep guys locked down as well.  The squad I place him with is a standard consisting of healing support and DPS.  Typically Vero Baretta Bella Megan and Sig. Sometimes swapping in Shannon Bernard Darion Eladriel and Ahman depending on what I am facing.  Its more of a controlled approach rather than speedburst DPS.  I also dont have many  units or runes so I have to take it slow and steady to find success. I hope this helps.,summonerswar,crvhuuk,2,t5_324pd

4187873,0,t3_38s62y,I rearranged my runes and now feel like I am worse. I have a huge problem with Swift runes and have basically zero Violent slot s. I changed Verdehile from Violent to Swift I feel like its a downgrade although he gained a lot of speed Bella from Swift to Violent. I feel like this is an upgrade but he is a little squishier Veromos from Swift to Violent. I feel like this is an upgrade again but he is a little squishier but a lot faster. He also has Revenge now. Sigmarus from Violent to a slightly worse ViolentI just feel like my monsters are a lot squishier now. I thought for sure Id have no problem autoing DB with the above team and Chasun who didnt really change much since I was so close before. Now Im at about the same point and didnt make much ground on it. I use Sigmarus as my lead and go Right gt Boss. I feel like Accuracy is a huge problem. Both Veromos and Belladeon have low accuracy and its making it difficult when I get a string of resists. I cant upgrade my accuracy or I lose too much HPSPD.I dont know what to do. My options are Work on Chloe and get her in here somehow. Fuse Mikene and see if she can do it at  with no skillups. Do absolutely nothing but HoH and semimanual DB this month hoping to make my Violent sets better. I have a ton of  SPD runes and some great offsets but I just cant use any of them because of a few absent Violents Ignore DB and do a month of GB. I could really use the Swift but that feels like all I really need for my main monstersIm lost EDIT Good news I guess. I just had the same thing happen three times in a row and still finished. Bella got killed by right tower and then Verdehile died shortly after to just damage. Chasun Veromos and Sigmarus proceeded to trio the dragon from full health while he had  turns of immunity left. Good news I guess.EDIT  I just full autod  times in a row! I am assuming I just got lucky since the only person to ever kill the tower was Bella. Bella what are you doing you dont even do any damage.EDIT  I just realized since I switched the team up a couple hours ago I have been using Veromos as leader instead of Sigmarus leader. Throwing away  health is probably not in my best interests....EDIT  Veromos just lived a tower revenge hit for the first time ever with like  health left. Thanks Sigmarus leader skill!EDIT  Its safe to say I am an idiot and may have somewhat solved the problems myself.  full autos in a row all success. Zero deaths on stage  which is weird I think I got lucky there.,summonerswar,crxma10,1,t5_324pd
4189022,0,t3_38tihk,Well its really awkward since I started to play like about Juli  and im now just lvl . I had horrible luck with summoning no nat  and just  nat  wrong attribute tho now after  premium packs lol FP btw I really love this game but im not sure if i want to invest more time in this game because of my luck. Im already not playing that much but i love to go on reddit and read there more about the game since i think its wellmade and it makes fun to learn things even though if ur not playing that active anymore. My neighbour and her sister both started playing at around the time but both got nat  Anavel and Ariel  and some top tier nat s. I can auto giants B haha. Probably I should work on the obligatory farmable mons like shannon bernard light trio but its just not fun to see the girls have so good monsters and are further in the game than me with less effort.Btw I think its really nice of u to give that account away oand dont mind my english lol,summonerswar,crxqz2e,-4,t5_324pd

If you can resist that then you dont have to worry about cleanse or shield.On dragons it doesnt seem to matter as much because the left tower seems to have more than  accuracy. The left tower has a high probability of landing a CD effect on you even with  resist. Just ask any Lumi soloers for DB.,summonerswar,cry40p3,1,t5_324pd

While I love Darion and all I feel hes better off in PVP which comes later. I personally rarely used him in PVE. For B try to have a minimum k hp with  def. You can use the same team my friend uses.

4238721,0,t3_39hgh5,Well youre in luck! Since fire joker and fire sylph are both fusable monsters essentially fusable devilmons do what I am doing fuse many jokers for your Liebeli and Sylphs for Baretta and Tyron. I know this may not be the most efficient method but it is the only way us FP players can get more devilmons and levelling monsters to level  max doesnt require too much energy so I suggest you fuse some nat  fodders and use them to  stardevil your nat s and save the devils for nat s only unless its an amazing unit that doesnt have fodders that can be fused like Chasun.

4253474,0,t3_39oijq,my suggestion is when you are starting out do vero lead shannard bella darion. this is a safe comp that takes into acount passives that lower the rune requirements to reach the stat thresholds you need to survive a full auto run.after you get decent runes and are able to equip your sig with a rage blade set with decent hp substats might be worth going atk critdmg hp if not enough hp subs youd want him at around k hp at least with some def subs as well. you can then go with sig lead vero shannard bella.vero shannard bella is a really good core covering all your bases in gb the fifth guy is usually there to add a cushion of more utility to made the run safer either with a reviverdarionhealer or after you strengthen your team a bit more and they can pretty much  man with the core you can grab a dps like sig to make the runes faster.using that comp i can clear gb within minmin which is a decent time. my current comp is faster changing bernard to copper needs really good runes from db. this setup is really safe. its pretty much my . with lesser runes there might be fail rates but will improve the more you improve them.,summonerswar,cs52zxf,2,t5_324pd
4253508,0,t1_cs4vd4n,yeah thats my point. if its intended that theres no situation where theyd ever be useful remove them from loot tables or replace them with a mana reward for the equivalent sale price.personally i like having as many interesting choices as possible. having flat runes have limited situational use is much better than them being trash  of the time. ,summonerswar,cs534wi,1,t5_324pd

I was talking to some people in chat and for some reason they love bringing up his potential aoe damage as if getting  debuffs to stick on anything was the easiest thing in the world. Have you tried him in toa hard? I had mine runed almost the same as yours but with spdcdatk despairblade only  though.. couldnt bring myself to  him and like you said... he was pretty underwhelming. Ive always wondered if the damage he can put out would be worth it though.... if tehres anywhere in the game he might be useful itd be toa hard but since I mostly run a ccdot team I dont really have a feeling for how much hp everything actually has. My first impression is that anywhere you can stack that many debuffs on and require that much damage you might as well go with more dots and anywhere else you can use pretty much any wind dd. ,summonerswar,cs8b29j,1,t5_324pd

Consequently first skill usage will drop from  of the time to  of the time. Assuming your Veromos has max accuracy he will land dots with his first skill  of the time after factoring in resistance. Hence your Veromos will output . less dots on the GiantDragon each turn which equates to an average of  less twoturn dot every  turns. That honestly isnt very significant and the downsides are heavily outweighed by the advantages of max skilling him in this case. ,summonerswar,csag98n,3,t5_324pd

To add on itll be better to focus on Tamor Desert  Hell once you get him to  since hell do it a lot faster than Ramagos can in Hydeni Hell .I personally fused Baretta before making my first  though. A  Baretta helps a lot for the early stages in the game as he can be used in Arena Scenario maps Cairos Dungeons and ToA.

You are gambling with smaller chances than if you saved for the legendary scroll.The elemental scrolls are even more expensive than the mystic scroll for the same nat nat  rate.Summoning stones are... there I guess. If you absolutely want a very specific nat  or even a nat  for fusion its actually a decent choice but its very inneficient in terms of gpsummons if theres nothing in particular you want.

Its actually a nice detour if you arent rushing so hard for an ifritlegendary scroll.tldr ifrit is the least gamble with the highest likelihood of extremely good results legendary scroll is the second best rendering guild shop mystic scrolls obsolete and having a small chance of giving utterly amazing results much more of a gamble than ifrit summoning stones are ok once in a while for specific cases.

4422820,0,t3_3bohr4,Before I used to make Acasis as lead for GB together with Shannard Bella and Michelle  full auto  safe. After fusing and ing Vero I run Vero lead Acasis Shannard Bella. Still  success full auto. You know what makes it safe?  aoe healers  Acasis and Bella. Sure Darion reduces dmg received by  but he doesnt heal every  turns. The Boss fight with that team takes longer than  turns and I doubt Bella can solosustain your team that long if shes your only healer. Plus Acasis has dots to help slowly deal dmg on boss.

4449839,0,t1_csrkvjj,Bernard with a speedyish team should manage against him. If you have Theomars that would make it pretty easy with the duo. In my roster should I not have Verde Id run BernardTheomarsBellaChloe. Turn order would be BellagtBernardgtTheogtChloe. That eliminates Verde first turn and ends with immunity and invul for their turn assuming you go first. Even if Bella went after bernard but before theo it would work the same might even work fine with Chloe going first because theres a decent chance shell get  turns before they get one assuming youve killed Verde. Tyron could suffice for chloe leader skill  cc is good enough. Any DD who can oneoff Verde could be swapped for Theo but he would be optimal bc he scales with speed.TLDR theres more than one atb bufferEDIT Somehow missed your saying you dont have Chloe. Whoops.

4467984,0,t3_3cb23e,Personally I would NEVER attack any team with an AoE beneficial effect removal with double lushen and I doubt anyone else would either its WAY too risky. So Juno by herself is a lushen deterrent.I think having Juno Anavel AND Chloe is overkill on the immunitybuff removal and Chloe should be replaced with some damageother support.I think a strong defense for you would be Juno Anavel Darion Chasun. Its going to be hard to nuke anyone due to inherent tankiness  darion. Its going to be next to impossible to CC you out due to Juno and Anavel and the potential heals are really strong for obvious reasons. You also have some kill potential on any veromos common tank for darion or any damage dealer.In essence it looks like a really long fight with a very real chance of losing no matter who you bring.,summonerswar,cstv5h2,1,t5_324pd

Over a long period of time it enables a consistent distribution but short term allows for things like many Raoq procs.All of the summoning rituals revolve establishing that you are at a low or high point of the wave form and doing your summons from that point. Summoning when you get a MS in the shop... rare  extreme low  high. Summoning after multiple lightnings when powering up youre establishing that the waveform has droppedrisen and is not just the deviations dipping into the range of change. All the game mechanic rituals fit this hypothesis of the RNG waveform.,summonerswar,ct7ob24,1,t5_324pd

Water warbear will be good for farming later on so you should either start leveling bad units to feed them to warbear evolution or evolve about  units to  stars. So I would  hellhoundgtwarbeargtfairy. Then I would start leveling my  monsters into  and x  star monsters into  those that u dont plan on using. For your first evolution you should feed your fire golem and wind drunken master and some  monster that you evolve. After evolving hellhound warbear and fairy with  monsters that are evolved unless u get more  monsters that are bad I would level taharus to lvl  so he can be used in water dungeons and be fed to warbear later to  him. At the same time I would keep leveling  monsters that will be used to evolve water warbear to .So  monsters to  gt taharus to  level gt water warbear to  with taharus   bad monsters taharus has some uses but he is pretty useless at that point.Edit Oh I forgot new water magic knight.

One tower could not attack at all but give a  or more speed to all your monsters in arena making speed teams more deadly. This would also make the game more strategic and you would have to think about which tower your enemy might have. Other towers could be one that gives like AoE will for  turn to the start of all your monsters but it also wouldnt attack. One that takes forever to charge and your opponent could bring an atb resetter but if they didnt then it could do a massive AoE nuke which would be really good for stall teams or an even binger single target nuke but also take really long to charge.Like I said I really like it and could see a ton of new depth and more strategic teams being formed and you having to find ways around it.,summonerswar,cthfyec,1,t5_324pd

4673469,0,t3_3ey8ni,Yes your first  should be a farmer.  But there are  ways you can go with that.  Do you want A to be able to clear lower level areas very quickly like speed farming faimon normalhard depending on runes or B to be able to get as much exp per energy regardless of time using slow tanky mob like Ramagos to clear Aiden hardhell.For option A your best bet is definitely Malaka.  He can clear faimon very efficiently at s and he can be a primary DPS in all phases of the game and uses the relatively easier to acquire FatalFocus runes.For option B Ramagos is pretty reliable.  With very easy to get Energy runes he should be able to clear harder content and while he isnt as useful all around as Malaka he has very strong situational uses.,summonerswar,ctjn3zx,1,t5_324pd

Ahman is great for topping up DoT damage and healing your squishy DPS monsters but generally for endgame hell be outperformed. If your team is full of tanky monsters Bellas percentage heal will heal for more not to mention providing more utility for the team as well defense break atb boost cleanse. Thats not to say Ahman is outright bad in endgame just that he will fall off. He will still most likely find use in DB GB or ToA.

4722785,0,t1_ctptbm4,Thanks for your answer! Yeah it does seem difficult to rune him as farmer but the problem is I have no one else who can potentially farm faimon or aiden hell. My Gildong can only do faimon hard at the moment and the others can only farm tamor hydeni etc. and those maps are too slow and inefficient to six star anything. So for now Id only use Varus for farming even though I know that he must be great in other areas.With the runes I currently have at least star some stars I can make him reach  CR with some decent ACC for his second skill plus tons of speed due to swift basically I can make him a good enough mon but if he does need revenge to be able to farm aiden then Ill have to farm dragons and sacrifice his ACC or his speed. Idk. Ive already got one  revenge rune from dragons today and will keep refilling until I have a set. Hopefully I can make it work.

4803502,0,t3_3go9za,Therere many reasons but here are the main ones Bad typing for the current meta. Not as good as Theo and Tesa. Who wouldnt want the better Ifrit after saved up GP for  weeks? Requires setup to be good people prefer simple easier wind aoe dps which is Lubrokenshen. Not that everyone had Lushen but its one of the main reason why Amir is less popular. Oh I guess Kata counts too. End game arena is filled with Immunity which reduces his useful ness. Bad skills scaling. First skill scales with Spd second scales with HP and rd scales with Atk. You could build him as a tanky CC but his stats is not good enough you could build him as a fastviolent attacker but that would waste his rd skills amazing potential. His best build is full dps but singletarget nuker is more preferred in the current meta.That said hes fairly good for newbies and a decent wind dpsCCer arguably better than Shimitae and maybe on pair with Julien. Amir just came at the wrong time if we had him at early days of the game then hell probably be the most popular among the wind dps.Anyway just to be clear I fucking hate him. Getting  Amir after  weeks is not funny. Im positive that Tesa or Theo could take me to G since I lack good singletarget dps but trollus said NO.,summonerswar,cu00s3l,11,t5_324pd

4814699,0,t3_3gtpqq,Bring Veromos Bella Shannon Ahman and another CC monster. In my case its tyron L.  I attacked Chiwu directly.  The strategy is to buff only after Chiwu  had already used his rd skill which takes your buff and heals itself so this is very important reminder.  Another advise is to ensure that the other monsters atleast two are stunned so use yours stuns every other turn.  Hope your shannon is on despair.  I am stuck here  days ago after I got help also here on reddit.  Use bella to remove buff of chiwu.  Basically you need at least two healers and two cc units.,summonerswar,cu1fkvb,1,t5_324pd

They arent meant to be end game units which is why monsters have been added to replace them Chasun replaces Shannon Aquila replaces Sieq Veromos replaces Konamiya etc. etc. This is more or less a suggestion to help newer players deal with having to fight runed players by having high damage units at the ready that dont scale with runes as much as they scale with levels and then fall off.,summonerswar,cu6e6ki,1,t5_324pd

Oh Brig was probably introduced as a counter to Theomars ADGDs.    Most already have Tesarion Brig Megan Delphoi andor Lumirecia at high level so making a counter to it isnt really that hard or out of the plan many have.     In addition to this you can always stun him or the partner that is vital for him to survive for a bit longer.  The issue is mostly down to runes when people struggle with him and the reason he is in every ad is because he is farmable to an extent not because he is that much better than other options.  I do agree the endure buff was way more than he should have gotten and i even have it in my posthistory that I was very much against that buff and still am.

5006325,0,t3_3jicbd,Most commonly used team I see is VeroBellaMeganBriandCamillaSigHwa.Based off your monsters the easily to build VeroKonaBellaMeganBaretta.Lowest rune requirement team I see is VeroBellaKonaBriandHwaSigFew things I do notice based off this pretty much every single monster you take into DB should be  level  monsters at  lack the raw stats to complete DB most of the time barring godly runes. Runes should be pretty much a mixture of  most if not all of them should be . If youre failing with any of the above teams its pretty safe to assume your runes arent where they need to be or your monsters arent all  with enough skill ups.Side note Vero needs  speed violent runed or  speed swift runed you solo cleanse the Dragon stage by himself. Going Left tower gt right tower gt Boss is the safest and most efficient way to start off beating DB.If you find that you have the requirements but are failing to unlucky breaks then I would suggest going manual on the boss stage until you pick up a few decent violent runes. I know most people dont want to do that but honestly manually the boss is sometimes more effective than dropping to BB or failing B  of the time. ,summonerswar,cupg8gq,2,t5_324pd

With good runes he is able to heal around  k every round aoe and is great for ToA and every Dungeon. His heal skales with his hp its not like the most used healers that heal  what means he needs good stats and runes to be useful. In my opinion he is the support monster thats needs stats the most so you should  stars his as soon as possible. Was one of my first  too. ,summonerswar,cutkxre,1,t5_324pd

The third set is when awakened two stars no longer could be summoned.Summed rates do not include Legendary summons since Legendaries can only pull s and s it doesnt make sense to combine them in.Also my natural  rate is a bit high for the new set since I was lucky and pulled two since the change.  Im guessing it will fall back into normal over the next few months of continued summons...,summonerswar,cv1rcpm,1,t5_324pd

I use one it worked well as Violent ATKCDATK.

Id like to mention that my original team was sig leader vero koni Bella Briand. That team fell apart almost every time at the zaiross stage. I swapped Bella with Ahman and thats when I started seeing more success his heal is super helpful for the mini boss while cool downs are reset. From there Ive been switching between koni and Bella.

I build mine despairrevenge with hpdefhp. This lets him stay alive as long as possible to keep immunity up. Plus it gives him a reliable AoE stun since no glancing a chance to stun on his basic attack with built inviolent for more stuns and a chance to stun on revenge with another chance for free turns on revenge.

5252854,0,t1_cvj4gkk,gt fuck you to those who have invested in duplicates that arent just Lushen.i actually cant imagine many other duplicates which would be useful besides maybe Hwa for whose duplicate i would still prefer to use another mon and natsgt How will comus compensate those that build  Chloes or  Katarinas?why should they? its the own decision of each player to build duplicate mons. every one knows that duplicates can be summoned and some of us know exactly what it means to have several duplicates. i cant imagine the build a duplicate and you will progress in game thing being Comus direction for the players to play the game. i think they meant duplicate summons to use as skill upgrades otherwise they wouldnt let them count as skillups when used on same type monsters or just simply never let you summon it again in the code side as long as you have one version of it. this whole  is good but  of the same is better thing just doesnt make sense to me and stands contrary to the vast quantity of monsters they introduced until now. progress shouldnt mean to have as many as possible of one type. diversity is the key thats why duplicates are boring and should be not allowed,summonerswar,cvj5o8f,0,t5_324pd

5360485,0,t1_cvwubts,His main direct damage output and CC are from Surprise Attack this is also the reason for a crit damage rune by the way so being able to cycle its cooldown as fast as possible is always good especially with that  turn CD. Any skill with a  turn CD is almost guaranteed to be used twice in a decent Violent chain. For what its worth Im currently using a  Energy all HP Jultan because those are the best runes I have available but I definitely want to switch him to  Revenge if I can get the HP runes for it. Violent is considered endgame because with enough Crit Damage and HP getting two Surprise Attacks in one chain can even kill tanks. ,summonerswar,cvwv26w,2,t5_324pd

It doesnt matter what you build or what strategy you come up with. At the end of the day blind luck wins or loses. I used to confuse it with strategy and I think most of us who play still do.Even past a certain point it becomes a rinse repeat of who can shield or remove shields first and  or then kill a single target. There is nothing else to it because if those two things dont play out immediately RNG takes over and it becomes a slot machine.Still pretty sweet luck considering you needed almost that exact specific scenario to play out to win and it happened.,summonerswar,cvx8cs4,14,t5_324pd

I personally recommend you to ignore your MK for now and try to get a proper team to get further in GiantsDragonsother halls before giving a fuck about your MK. There is a big chance that you will get a good  monster from the MS that give you something that can solo Faimon or other area that is better than your MK.Water Inugami is fusion material keep at lvl  for now.

5480719,0,t3_3q5k1z,I started in June so I can tell you a little of whats happened since then off the top of my head! There were Mermaids Pirates and Sharks added during the summer. Then they added monsters from some other game that I STILL havent heard the name of but the monsters are Neostone Fighter Assassin Neostone Agent Martial Artist and maybe one other that I forgot. There was a new dungeon called the Necropolis and everyone HATED it because the boss steals your monsters to fight against you and comes back to life like a billion times but then they nerfed it and now people are ok with it. They moved Rage runes to that Dungeon and also the new Destroy runes which sound amazing andor broken because they take away a percentage of the enemys total HP every time you hit them So basically healers and tanks are gonna have a rough time. Lots of rune drops from story stages were moved around and people are still trying to figure out whether Faimon is the best place to farm. There was an event where the prize was a dark cowgirl so some people have that but its not great. Then there was this desert update and the monsters from it seem cool Mummy Horrus Anubis and Desert Queen. Desert Queen is a Nat. They all seem decent except maybe the mummies but the water one is cool. and now were here at Halloween where we have Frankensteins which are meh and JackOLanterns which are SO FREAKING CUTE and good for Necropolis. People like the Water Light and Dark ones the best. Oh and the general population is angry because the game is crashingdcing a lot. If I missed anything sorry.

5491741,0,t1_cwd8hmu,Copper definitely has the edge on the damage department since his third skills multipliers are  ATK   DEF while Fire Frankie here only has around  DEF multiplier but in two hits.But unlike popular detractions on Bulldozer dealing half the damage of Copper those are mathematically incorrect. Why? Because it would mean that Copper had to invest on both ATK and DEF in order to do twice as much as Bulldozer.Unruned and at level one Bulldozer will only rely on his DEF while Copper has both DEF and ATK to use so it does look like Copper deals twice as much. But further along when these monsters face rune decisions both Defensetype monsters will definitely need DEF stats and buffs so Coppers ATK will be near negligible.Yet if you decide to invest on both Coppers ATK and DEF you might not be able to ignore the targets defense anymore Copper ignores defense ONLY IF he has more than twice as much DEF of the target.But of course these are merely computations regarding their third skill. As I said Bulldozer has a lot more than just ignore defense going on with his kit so I guess I will get back to you once I get mine to at least  with max skillups! ,summonerswar,cwdmdht,1,t5_324pd

5508547,0,t3_3qhxdw,While I dont think theyll nerf Theo I dont think hes as bad as most people may think. CU will Nerf Theo when they Nerf Violent again which will be never.Most people here probably dont remember when Vero was released and how quickly he flooded the Arena Meta so heavily that now  out of  people on your Arena list right now past C probably have him.Vero pushed people from F to C in the same way that Theo pushed people from C to C.Without Theo I wouldnt be a C  G players Id probably be stuck at C or C like I was before I pulled him. I use him mostly for the leader skill giving me so leeway with my CR subs on my nukers.Without Theo AO doesnt change much for most there are a million and one strategies to use to beat people. On AD however a lot of FP will be forced to convert back to Stall comps because outside of Chimeras  Pernas  Camillas and a few others its hard to find an offensive damage unit you can use on AD without fearing people will just oneshot it.As a FP player losing Theos passive means less than most people thing they remove his endure and then people will just start bring Revivers with him. SlowTheo will fade and the Meta of the fast  SPD Theo will come back and the goal will be kill as many of them before they kill you.From a PVE perspective looking mostly at DB  HoH  TOA Normal Theo allows people to progress quite easily which is what I believe the real goal of Theomars was in the first place. A universal DPS unit thats not Sig for FP people who havent pulled a nice NB or NB. Theo found his way to Arena just like Vero found his way to Arena after being used extensively in GB  DB  HoH  TOA N  TOA H  Elementals,summonerswar,cwfrmsg,1,t5_324pd

5530961,0,t1_cwi98c5,gt Uhh because theres nothing else to buy with crystals? Should I not be buying packs with them?Ah yes. When people start out the game myself included premium packs are the big juicy steak that everyone is clamoring for. Some people dropping hundreds of dollars to buy premium packs. As you get further in the game energy becomes a huge bottleneck. Running bb dungeon  times will tap your energy in a matter of like  minutes. Plus at this point you will have good enough monsters to do these dungeons and thus dont NEED more monsters at least you wont need them in bulk like the premium back. Spending your crystals on energy goes way further than spending it on premium packs. Plus you get mystical scrolls from dungeons. If I spend  crystals on energy refills I can typically end up with at least  sometimes way more than  mystical scrolls. Plus I got millions of mana some rainbowmon fodder and runeswhatever. You can then turn around and spend that mana on shop mystical scrolls.Its something that as you hit level  and have a good amount of good monsters youll end up realizing. I dont blame you for thinking we are all dumb for not salivating over that juicy steak.,summonerswar,cwimncz,2,t5_324pd

5576339,0,t3_3rdlxl,hi nice post !i usually can hold g and have g as a goal for the next months. a question about my ADin the last few months my AD worked best as a Speed team maybe also with some Midrange elements. It was Seara Bernard Galleon fireMonkey. Now i recently pulled Woosa amp Orion and would like to incorporate them somehow. i thought of Seara Orion Woosa Monkey ? so that given that Orion is fast enough Woosa would shield Orion would dispeldef break amp stun a few of them in order for Seara and Monkey to HKO  of the attackers in round one ?Seara would be violent Orion  viowill Woosa  swiftshield Monkey  yolo viorevother notable choices Vero Bella Eshir Verde viorev but slow atm Tyron Bernard spd only but Spd tower maxed Draco despairwill Galleon vio Lushen mediocre runes.thanks in advance,summonerswar,cwoap0g,1,t5_324pd

If I were you I would put Chloe instead of wind pioneer. Maybe consider swapping out Vero if already have immunity from Chloe.  Moreover Verde or Bernard may boost your AD if their runes is godly.

5643028,0,t1_cwwjb5r,It is indeed a bit disappointing. But it is not surprising that Sig hits harder. I mean that bird has nearly  more base att and a very decent multiplier on his second skill. I guess Karl could be interesting to reliably snipe some low hp nuker at the beginning of the battle without having to care if he is shielded or not. But admittedly that is a pretty niche role since his damage without def break will be on the border of not being enough for mons like Zaiross.  ,summonerswar,cwwklug,1,t5_324pd
5643071,0,t1_cwwephb,rd stage is completely rune quality. Your Vero is too slow not maxed or doesnt have enough accuracy to stun your Verde might be too slow and doesnt give your team enough chances to get turns and kill something before Zaiross moves. Or it could be that your DD of choice doesnt have enough CR or damage to reliably kill something.Ideally a crystal should be dead or stunned before Zarioss gets a turn and then you should be able to tank the reset and finish the stage without much issue.Instead of trying to tank it with Sig as lead make Verde lead and try to up his speed.Im running TheoVeroBellaMeganSpectra straight for dragon with no issues on rd stage.

Just like Veromos stunning every  turns at  instead of every  turns at . Skill ups on these monsters completely change how effective they are.

Ive watched my Veromos go down in that wave and hes max  with k HP and over k Defense while he runs in a composition with Verdehile hwa Bella and Megan.

5674224,0,t3_3subnn,Each time he cleanses a debuff out of himself he gets stronger which is probably what is giving you trouble based on what you wrote.The general strategy is to have dotters kill the right crystal but leave the left alone so your support monsters with little damage can use it as a punching bag thus preventing the boss from healing by counterattacking them and avoiding giving him debuffs.For the boss himself you want raw damage to offset his heals. Defense break should be avoided somewhat since he gets stronger by cleansing it but is good if you get a high enough burst out of it.Verdehwa should make it much easier especially because if they are fast enough they prevent the boss from ever getting a turn and therefore cleansing himself. Have verde target left crystal hwa targets him gg. But if your hwa has a tanky build you will still want more raw damage though if you can lock the boss down you can make do by bringing something with a heal block and slowly killing him kinda prone to resist strings though.,summonerswar,cx0fz9l,1,t5_324pd

5699815,0,t3_3t4pf6,Right now only the time and money I have invested in this game. I consider myself midendgame x done all cairos dungeonstoa normal arena when I can be asked ill get c.Why? The rewards for arena are poor vs the time you need to invest the ego reward is not what im looking for  ToA hard is a fair challenge but boring as you need to wait for rune removal day to swap your best runes around if you cannot progress Already have  ifrits so GW seems less rewarding angelmon? Dont really need anything  to progress and even if I did the fodder from clearing ToA is enough With all these Arena ToA GW Events etc there are the scrolls or crystals rewards but honestly dont kid yourself  you are getting  food and free energy to keep you hooked.HoH reusing mons is a killer for me. This is a clear try to attract mid range folks who started the game not so long ago and avoid releasing average mons or average food. Those folks who have been long enough to have seen most HoHs since Aria its like pointing the middle finger at me at least.The only good points so far is that they have not nerfed the rune powerup chance still costs a fortune but the same cannot say the same for summons... we get the occasional devilmon from event or weekly arena they keep pumping out new mons and they do lots of rebalancing this can be conceived as a bad point but they have no obligation to rebalanceMy only hope and solace would be to find a small upandcoming guild and aid them in GW  at least there I would feel a sense of achievementThis is a rant so take my words with a pinch of salt ,summonerswar,cx3m8cq,1,t5_324pd

5781578,0,t3_3uco9j,He is good for arena as a single target buff remover and each violent proc is one more buff removed target too. He is also capable of finishing off theomars but then you would need to use another buff remover and have him go after the DD.That said having a DB team is not a reason to not use him there. He is just perfect for straight to dragon teams since he pretty much ensures the Dragon never keeps immunity for too long. He even enables ultrafast YOLO pure damage teams since its rare for the dragon to resist all  of his hits.He is also perfect for NB even if his passive is wasted there.  hits on skill  slow on skill one AND teamwide speed buff is awesome by itself.,summonerswar,cxdrct5,2,t5_324pd

5847703,0,t1_cxm4rby,Hey dragon  Check notes links they have a whole lot of information concerning the game. That being said I can help from my personal experiences and seeing your current main monsters. Youre level  at the very early stages of the game. It sounds like your team is handling about what it should good job! Focus your efforts on a few key monsters. Figure out which monster is going to be your super farmer and  him right away. Out of your collection you have some huge summons You have Fran Arnold Platy Michelle Lexy Liesel and Draco. As a personal choice I would focus Arnold Platy Liesel and Draco to boost your farming potential. Your beast monk is already in a good place. Find some additional healers you have some great ones already in particular grab the easily farmedsummoned ones. Try to grab Konamiya Colleen Lulu and Rakaja are the beginning variety that remain strong through the midgame.Theres so much more but try reading through TMG and other guides.  Some of the content is outdated but most of the concepts still apply today. The key really is to focus on a core team imo  mons min no more than  mons max to help you get a good start in the game. Rune them up to mostly  runes from scenarios then start farming Cairos giants to start to get them even better runes.,summonerswar,cxm5uiz,1,t5_324pd

5879507,0,t3_3vs1e7,I love the changes and think CU is headed in the right direction giving the hardcore FP a chance at nice things more LD scrolls more Legendary scrolls summoning stones and perfecting runes.This game is about a FP friendly as its going to get if youre looking for changes that truly shorten the gap between PP and FP youd have better luck drowning a goldfish.It doesnt make any sense from a profit gaining perspective for them to do that when the FP community in some sense might be happier more at peace than the PP ones who are constantly raging about entitlement summoning rates.I think the new mana packs as well as the old one are just money scams for the impatient suckers who either cant farm mana reliably DB or who are too lazy to do so. You can make more money from crystals  refills alone than any of the mana packs combined. Theyll bring in more money for CU with these updates but those purchasing it really wont get much further. Id say as a general rule for efficient spending its always been Refills gt Mana Packs gt Summoning packs.I farm DB regularly and pull in between kM mana a day and thats including after I upgrade the runes to see if its worth to keep or not.I have a NB team as well which pulls in around M a day I like to alternate because I need Will  Rage  Nemesis runes from NB..M for a LD scroll is so fking worth if youre FP where otherwise youd be limited to  LD a month assuming you can clear up to TOA Normal amp Hard  and do the daily login. I dont see how you can complain about it being expensive LD monsters for the most part are trophy monsters. They dont really benefit anyone. Despite their rarity  of them have pretty awful kits and no true place to shine in the game.Legendary scrolls are roughly .M if bought purely from the shop but since they stack with Legendary pieces in guild war you can reasonably get them for around M or less assuming your guild wins on a regular basis and you contribute each battle. You should have plenty of GP to put torward Leg pieces if you really want a certain Nat .I think overall its a great change just more ways to enhance the endgame experience.,summonerswar,cxqc3go,2,t5_324pd

5888312,0,t3_3vv57s,I see this as a management problem. It all starts with hiring the right people and asking yourself where you want to be and what do you want the guild to be.Low end guilds are like walmarts.You take who you can get. Because of this personality clashes are common. People willing to quit fast also occurs due to little loyalty. If management has no want or the knowledge to raise its guilds rank or level then short of learning how nothing will change and there will be high turn around.Mid level guilds are like your established local business.You win enough to award people decently enough. Most of these people are happy to just do their part. These guilds have longer stability. The only people that will leave are the ones who want more.  Only way guild fails is if management pushes too hard to move them up and their core group does not buy in creating friction between a management and group and then the core will split off and make their own.G guild are like tech companiesCommonly these guys fluctuate a lot. Guilds fracture  and reform very fast. Members are shuffled around a lot between each other in that hope to get the next piece that pushes them up to G. Since members are hungry and competitive if a guild does not meet their needs for victory they will leave even if they cant achieve that level they want. This is were real guild management comes in play. Motivating players. Coaching. Building core players. Removing destructive players no matter how talented. Sometimes even the new guy trying to get better and has great intentions is the destructive person. Management leadership knowledge sharing plays a heavy role here.G are the Fortune  home officesPedigree is needed to even join. Selection process is more in depth. Because they are a desired organization thus they are able to get who they want and fill the gaps they want. Members in this position or self motivated. Managing personnel is no longer the major concern like G but still requires a light and accurate touch. Leadership and knowledge sharing more key. If you cant keep your members believing in your group then they will go to the comp and you will see them on game day using all that knowledge and assets you helped them get against you.,summonerswar,cxrhpfr,4,t5_324pd

Vero was the game changer for me allowing me to go from manual GB to Auto GB.

Provoke Zaiross as much as possible and reduce the attack bars as necessary through Hwa and Baretta whilst Baretta and Veros DoTs do the work. Keep attack break on Jamire and if you can cycle Hwa so as many mons get slowed as possible.Edit Whenever Im in doubt on whether I can clear a floor I take out trash mobs first just my personal preference.Didnt notice the five star Shannon I would use her in place of Hwa though it becomes even more important to keep both Zairosses controlled the def buff glancing slow and stuns will help Ahman tank the provoked mons.,summonerswar,cxzdpa6,1,t5_324pd

This guy deactivates passive yes but you might already have a counter for most comps Verde comps and Vero comps and you only need him mostly for those Camilla comps.To me I need him mostly for Camilla comps hence I need him built with tankiness instead of damage. this also helps when I send him against THeo because once Passive is off theo targets fire. ,summonerswar,cy27ca7,1,t5_324pd

6011042,0,t3_3xt6la,Alrighty then! You have a number of really good units including but not limited to a great immunity option in fire brownie  Draco but for RIGHT NOW it looks like youre early enough in the game that you cant use all of them just yet some ex. Luer are more for midlategame PVP for example and even Draco is terrible in Giants B which is the first main PVE destination.SO.For now what we need to do is get you set up with a good farmer  someone who can clear Faimon Normal or Aiden Normal pretty quickly alone so you can use them to grind up other units and evo stuff. I personally am a really REALLY big fan of Sath fire Grim Reaper especially now that we have the freebie rune rewards for clearing parts of campaign that make it easy to rune him the  ones make him trivially easy to rune hes one of the fastest Faimon clearers in the game  sec runs if you can oneshot everything and AIderpimmune and can be useful in earlygame arena though midlategame hes fucking horrible in arena so dont get too attached to him there. With decent runes like the s campaign Fatal or Blade reward set he can clear Faimon Normal instantly on Normal at  stars or  star him for Hard and will be your primary farmer for the rest of the game unless you pull one of the two nats Alicia or Teshar who can rival him.If you hate Sath for whatever reason Raoq fire inugami and Lapis water magic knight can clear Faimon pretty quickly too though not as easilyquickly as Sath but its not a huge difference.Once you get a farmer going you want to start focusing on Giants floor  GB  the core team is wind griffinpixie light inugami a fused dark ifrit and  of your choice usually either a supplementary healer or DPS or both like a fused water phoenix another DoT guy an extra healer... etc. Drunken Masters are seriously underrated monsters Wind DM can beast GB Light is great for Rift etc Belladeon and Veromos pretty much need  stars to safely clear GB Shannon usually does Bernard is fine at  stars your last slot usually needs to be  stars especially if its a squishy DPS.Wind neostone agent if skilled can mostly replace Shannon and is a great unit in general.,summonerswar,cy7ksx1,1,t5_324pd

And what really helps at the rd stage is something that stuns or attack breaks them often. options you can doget more hp on all these monsters and little more speed specially on vero and make koni just a little slower than vero or the monster you want to have most turns. or go for a team like replacing berreta with sigmarus for more burst dmg and more hp. and still increase the hp and speed.,summonerswar,cycl8lg,1,t5_324pd

The only max rd skill is for units like Chasun where the first two skills dont necessarily change how she functions as a unit but her rd skill is night and day between no skills and max skills.The skill ups are always random there is no choosing. But people say these things so that you dont waste devilmon. In the case of a unit like Chasun where the Only max rd skill applies then you dump skill ups in until the goal of maxing rd skill is achieved then stop. This could take exactly as many skill ups as her rd skill has or it could involve fully skilling up her entire kit. With a unit like Verdehile where its dont max nd skill go ahead and put in skill ups one at a time to get the damage boost but be careful not to get the cooldown reduction on the nd skill as thats the part of his nd skill power up that you dont want.,summonerswar,cymtbtn,1,t5_324pd

6158245,0,t1_cyp0sgj,It is indeed   maxed.However i should mention that in regards to your st skill x the stun chance comment is is incorrect on multihit skills only first hit has a chance to stun or else a despair Orochi would be guaranteed stun on rd skill.She does have her uses for sure for me personally given the monsters i use i would not trade anything out for her.Also i checked and soha has generally higer multipliers with slightly less on the first skill that should balance out the stats.Junos advantage lies on a shorter Cleanse at  turn CD.Basicly what im seeing here is that she basicly becomes an annoying mon that can stun like any despair runed mon with the benefit of not being able to be debuffed kinda and having the ability to threathen your buffs.Still not feeling it haha would have prefered praha which could have done the exact same but providing a heal xD,summonerswar,cypmn74,1,t5_324pd

If he goes after Galleon gt Poseidon the enemy team will have at least  or  debuffs on them depending on GalleonPoseidon derpage and maybe an extra one if your Poseidon is on Despair.Thats  extra damage for making that decision. If your Amir is speedtuned his primary skill will still hit like a truck think Theomars st skill damage even if hes atkcdatk.My Amir does around k x  with Galleon buff and his st skill hits for about k on his second turn atk buff and enemy has def buff so Amir can still clean up.My two cents ,summonerswar,cyq0vj5,1,t5_324pd

I just have to step in and talk to people privately if we got conflicts in the guild. GW wise and attacking towers everyone basically knows to check the number of swords first before attacking.

I basically only use the Focus tool because I have a ton of mons and runes but I feel I dont understand how it works. Maybe you can explain here or directly on your website how this thing picks up the builds.

6215310,0,t1_cyvumls,You have a chance at three star runes from the normal bosses. They can also be of blue quality. All bosses give you a chance at a  star ranked rune so if you are solely looking for runes and grinding which you would be at this point then it is often the best place to do it.Swift runes are my personal favorite at your level. Speed is something that wont improve with levels base speed is static though some units get   on awakening and something that you can stack with little impact to your other stats.I just read your monster listing.Things I would focus on|Monster|Rune Set|Explanation||||Wind Griffon|Swift whatever SPDHPACC or HP|Focus on getting SPD and HP over anything else. Look for it on substats. Bernard gives you a DEF debuff which basically doubles your dmg output ATK Debuff which reduces theirs by  a SPD buff which gives you  faster units and if you use swift this gets THAT much better and a  attack bar booster letting your units go sooner. One of the best units int he game top .|Wind Epi. Priest|Swift is still my preference SPDHPHP| I like Michelle fast to keep her group healing skill going more often and keep your buff duration up and debuff duration down. Her revive is amazing until you get better much later.|Wind Mummy|EnergyGuard HPHPHP|It will help you on early dragon runs as it is dot immune and it applies dots with skill  and passive great for bosses.|Copper|Guardx DEFDEFDEF|Just keep him around as he is your highest lvl unit he can help clear things for now. Just stack DEF crit and crit damage. May as well use him as your damage unit you dont have much else.|Wind WW|SwiftEnergy SPDHPHP| His passive is decent and he scales off of HP entirely. I like mine going early though to get the stun off on skill . A good unit to bring with a Bernard.|Magic Knight|SwiftBlade ATKATKATK|She is so slow innately I like swift to counteract this.

Logically you would be absolutely right if time was the only variable when it comes to leveling. Not only is it not I found it to be the least influential. Having enough mobs to fodder as well as the energy requirement to do so are factors that do not get improved by ing a farmer. The only thing ing a fodder does is increases your exphr at the cost of increased energy or crystalshr. This of course also contains the opportunity cost of hindered progression in Giants as well as ToA and by extension the rest of the game because you invested heavily into a monster that does not aid in your PvE progression. ,summonerswar,cz00dts,-1,t5_324pd

Gambling The most obvious one is the gambling factor you keep wanting that nat  and your brain just releases tonnes of dopamines when you get that similar to gambling in the casino.  Boasting it is humans nature to boast and brag. ComUs has done this wonderfully by announcing to the world that youve got a new Nat completed TOA etc.  Mobility This game can be literally played anywhere on your mobile unlike the convention PCconsole games. Auto mode The introduction of autoplay creates the illusion where you think that you can actually do other stuff while playing but in fact it keeps you hooked because you keep wanting to check back if you get that  legend rune.

Giants Dragons ToA pvp etc. He isnt as good in raids but thats a long ways off. His Aoe stun has a relatively short cooldown and is insane for ToA he has a dot which is great for dragons and giants and he has aoe cleanse. He should be your next  beyond any doubt.  Baretta will not help you much with GB  due to his elemental disadvantage but he is absolutely amazing in ToA where the name of the game is CC the monsters and let dots do the dmg. He is your best option to  for ToA.   Basalt is another ToA allstar. With attack bar reduction aoe heal aoe defense up and a provoke he excels and you are lucky to have one!  him soon for ToA.   Hwa is really good for ToA bosses and straight to dragon runs. Youre going to want to  her soon enough but there are more important monsters to .  Bernard is really good and will help a lot in GB. He should be on your team already. You will get a lot of use out of him in ToA GB and possibly pvpraidsive even seen him in some dragons runs. The only drawback to him is if you use Mav also another amazing ToA allstar their speed buffs dont stack. You should still look into ing him for GBToA.   Shannon needs to be d and soon. She will help you greatly in GB and ToA. She needs despair runes giving her AoE stun AoE slow AoE defense and attack up and glancing hit. Her defense buff doesnt stack with Basalts but she is such an amazing monster it doesnt matter.  Sig and Verdehille are also really strong monsters that need to be d.

Just a bit of RNG on stuns and provokeYou could try Ritesh for the provoke and Aria to give the jokers a bad time trying to nuke you down. The provoke tho is essential as the atk spd debuff. You can do it.. with like Baretta L Ritesh Ahman Veromos Spectra. Or maybe replacing Spectra for Aria dunno how you comp works best.

6391270,0,t1_czfy8qm,I build mine DPS Zaiross and still cleared TOA Hard with him. You gotta have the right team thats all. One question why is having a Zaiross will guarantee a G? I have only reach G recently and not entirely because of Zaiross. True he did helped A LOT but he would be nothing without my Vanessa lead and bernard. IMO you really need crazy spd sub in bernard or atb buffer to get in high ranks too. I have terrible luck in rune upgrading and never gotten any  spd despite playing ever since the first Magical Archer SD. Sometimes I met few bernard without spd lead and still faster than mine with lead. Another thing is theres just too many Will rune AD making my zaiross useless. So Im just saying that having a Zaiross isnt an instant G plus I cant stay in G for more than  minutes because I dont have a good AD.This is all just my opinion and sorry if I sounded rude.,summonerswar,czg4dq1,1,t5_324pd

I would try vero L bella sig acasis or lushen if he is tough enough and Bernard that should make for a decent fast team with everything you need to pass.  Toa  on the first pass comes down to having  starred max monsters and decent runes...it may be your runes holding you back.Tyron also works well or baretta. It looks like you should try and fuse Baretta he will help a ton you could lower the vero acc and try and get more speed and subs like HP and DEF to help.

6397161,0,t1_czgoc00,If you are dying that may mean you need to either  baretta improve your runes or bring a defense buffer. You have shannon   she works wonders. That or you can try a stunner.Also if you should not give up because of ONE case of bad RNG. There is always a  chance of resistance and you will miss. this was unlikely but it could happen. If you get there again then you will probably have better luck or maybe the time after that. It took me times to get through the first stage with my units I rearranged comps and runes and made it work. If all else fails right now wait for FRR and make a specific team.If chloe works for you at the boss stage why not but I dont like her since she brings very little other than the occasional immunity. shannon brings much more overall despite being squishy. Although you may really need the extra heals.Also could you post your box so we can see your  that you may have not listed  they may be helpful.

The only thing she offers is the random stun from despair and her buff removal. So to put pressure on opponents of course spd and hp are the most important but then you will need more cr to make sure her cycle turns more reliably and while youre on that it would be ideally to get some cd on her too.

6449011,0,t1_czmcy2f,I agreed with Link that Copper is better because hes easier to use BUT just because hes easier to use doesnt mean Driller is bad for PVP like all those mentioned in your thread.  .  Most people talk about mons they dont even have others dont have the experiencerunessupport to make him shine. Anyway. FYI driller hits like k on his first and his rd has enough to oneshot anything he has more surviveability than Copper he doesnt have elemental weakness  will reliably kill anyone whereas copper nocrit may mean a loss.  .  I still agree that Copper is probably better in most situations. Doesnt mean Driller is bad for PVP. On rune removal Ill run a spd galleon spd wind horus and driller for GWO. Turn galleon rd horus boost driller Anything under spdspd ldr will be dead except pernatheo lol. Even KumarsVelajuelsetcs.  .

Draco isnt a bad choice either but youre going to be doing a lot of farming in Faimon not only is it one of the most efficient places to farm but it also drops fire inugami which is another great farmer and Lapis is better there due to the elemental advantage.     While youre leveling up fodder work on leveling and skilling up your wind pixe water garuda and wind griffon which are all extremely powerful mid game units that you will use for a long time. If youre a free to play player that invests very little money in the game than throw your fire elven ranger in storage.

Hes generally built Despair with SpdHPHP or HPHPHP and whatever acc you can get from subs. Hes also dominant for HoH works great in DB honestly the only place he really has competition is GWarena where EladrielIona are abotu as gooda bit better especially in GW.In general though the units you listed are good and should work out alright if runed well and ideally d. BasaltBaretta combo is the god of ruining a bosss day def breakChow is a good way to tenderize most stuff in TOAN def breakHwa is a bit riskier than the Chow but will add slow debuff and atkbar reduction to completely shut down bosses.

I think faimon hard requires around  atk but you can do tamor hell  more easily.Hwa may be useful for you later on. Usually starting out youll want a full sustain team with little regard for dps. The good thing with hwa though is that she reduces the bosss dps so you could just try her out periodically and see how she does.As for kona v. rebecca fully skilled you have a  v  turn heal the heal is bigger unless you have gt debuffs and her resurge is excellent. I dont think rebeccas bad I just think kona is better as a pure support healer. You could also try someone like darion too if getting oneshotted by the giant is a problem.Bernard is a staple unit for giants and pvp and just generally a useful speedy support. He should get swiftfocus or swiftenergy with spdhp or defacc insert hp or defense on  or even  though if you need to. Its strange that hes dying a lot. Hes very tanky naturally so maybe level him up?edit Ramagod is ok if you want a slow farmer. Im personally not a fan of it but it is definitely more energy efficient.

6621800,0,t3_46d99l,It really depends on where you are at the game if you are farming reliably fast you can pretty much sell any runes in your inventory that arent perfect or fixable with gems.  Eventually you will realize you are keeping all of these good runes that end up in your inventory every month after removal because when you actually try to use them they are missing a core substat.An example might be things like Endure rune slot   star purple but with DEFCRCD looks good right?  It could be an awesome broken set get it to  with a little mana if it went all into DEF maybe you should consider selling it because an Endure rune without ResistHPSpeed will be pretty bad on a support and since it didnt land in the attacking stats you dont even really want to put it as a broken set either.The easiest place to clean is always shieldenduredestoryguard.  If you dont use those set often consider keeping only near perfect or perfect versions of them.

6719125,0,t3_46gc1n,Thanks for all your help.  I managed to climb TOAH higher each month thanks to this thread and finally cleared it this rotation! My regular boss team was Baretta L Basalt Mav Spectra Veromos.  Floor  was Baretta L Briand Chasun x x.  x being some combination of vero basalt mav or spectra.  I honestly dont remember but I one shot it with the team.  It was a team someone posted in a different thread.  Floor  was Baretta L Mav Spectra Bella Briand.  I tried many many times using Basalt and a few times with KonaHwa.  Lyrith killed Spectra too much and I lack Verde so Briand came up huge.  The attack break plus revive was huge. ,summonerswar,d0ebdq6,1,t5_324pd

Id much rather start with the RIGHT rune setup with green  stars and work my way up to s with good substats.  If you can farm the white  star runes of the right type youll have a solid base for your mon.  As the blue runes come in youll get slightly better.

If you can be patient enough I would suggest you try to fuse Veromos and  him first. You are lucky enough to only have the water harpy left at the moment so I would go with Vero.

However it could be the off chance that the revenge runes they have on have insane speedhpacc substats and thats why they are using it in PVP. and it just so happens that they completed a revenge rune set so added bonus!kinda like how after I ran the rune Optimizer turns out my Lushen can have a lot more atk and cdmg by sacrificing  crit rate by running RageGuard instead of RageBlade.

6791793,0,t1_d0ljw9n,Find out what your rules are.  The guild i am vice leader in has all  members with multiple  stars but there is still a decent disparity between the top players that have   stars with lots of good runes and the lower members with  or   stars and a few decent runes.  But our guild demands that you at least try with every sword.  If you cant get a win go for a draw but you must try.  All unused swords are counted and tracked on a spreadsheet once someone hits our limit of unused and unexcused you can email leadership and explain why you didnt use swords swords they get the boot.  This works for our guild as we get rid of the ones that dont help out and eventually replace them with people who want to fight so our turnover is actually pretty low we booted  so far this year i think.  But the point is you better find out what the rules are for your guild because if they have something similar you may be shown the door if you value energy over trying to help the guild.I was level  and in a guild before it is tough no doubt.  Some fights are harder than others.  But honestly the best way to get better at guild fights is to take time to think about the enemy and try to put together something that can beat them.  Even though at your level you may actually be trying to beat half the enemy that is fine as a draw is better than a defeat for you and your guild.  So go ahead and stack your guys on half your attack team maybe even use a sacrificial lamb for the other side to save your guys for the next fight.But remember this the leadership gets shown who had remaining swords from the last fight when they go to start the next fight.  If they keep seeing you with all your swords unused they are going to not like you very much.  The start new battle screen does not show you whether the player got wins draws or defeats in the last fight.  ,summonerswar,d0m4zvv,1,t5_324pd

6801327,0,t1_d0n7ax9,with this team comp. The aim of your team is to disrupt turns and win through attrition. In ghigh c. A vast majority of teams wont have any healers and are running very squishy teams. For example  zaiross amir galleon tiana Or Bernard dbl lushen megan. You honestly dont need damage dealers to kill off monsters like LushenZairossany other squishy aoe which is popular. The main win condition of this team is to get turn  and CC the enemy team disrupting the team. If youre able to stun megan for example. dbl lushen without atk buff will not kill your team. Same if you stun a lushen. Single lushen wont have enough fire power to nuke your team. With a nemesis bella youre also able to deny their nd damage dealer from moving if he outspeeds your orion. That at least is the idea behind using a team like this. This team is used to counter wombo combo teams moreso than slow teams. ,summonerswar,d0n81sw,1,t5_324pd

6841021,0,t1_d0rprb8,Not really. It depends on where youre at in the game. I sell a ton of runes that would be great for people entering mid game. Pros sell a ton of runes that would be great for me. For me if its blue and doesnt have speed on it then  chance it gets sold regardless of grade or main stat. Flat attackdefense as sub stats are really underbudgeted and can all but be ignored. Resistance is really good on a few select monsters in PvP settings but in PvE its a waste of what could have been a better stat. Likewise accuracy is crucial for monsters you need to land key debuffs Galleon but it comes at the cost of what could have been a better stat. Speed is almost universally king for nearly every unit. Sorry that the answer isnt as clear cut as you would like but theres no way to accurately answer it in that fashion. If dragons dropped a violent  star attack  rune in slot  with substats of  attack and defense I would sell it. Others wouldnt. ,summonerswar,d0rqgp0,2,t5_324pd

6853540,0,t3_49l3wx,You can probably beat GB full auto with your current monsters as long as you switch out a couple runes. GB is unacceptable you need  full auto since youll be needing lots of runes from there before you even touch DB.Your Vero has too little HP not enough speed. You can ideally sacrifice up to  acc to get you spdhp or spdheavy def.Same story for both your bella shannon and bernard. You absolutely need more accuracy  min on these three units especially bernard and shannon to land glancing and atk debuff so you can hurt less as well as landing Bellas seize in case the above two dont land. People keep suggesting to blindly add more HP thereby forgetting defense is equally important in calculating total effective HP. If you have decent high  def substats or runes Id suggest using them. I was able to get away with lower HP with most of my core mons because of high def .You essentially need to make your core mons faster tankier and more accurate. Most of the DPS will come from Veros dots.You arent wrong to  baretta since hell be useful for a very long time. I dont necessarily think you need to  shannon just yet so put that off to the side for now. Normal progression more or less is something likeGBgtTOA gtDBgtTOA gt TOA H NB,summonerswar,d0t5nwm,2,t5_324pd

6855537,0,t1_d0t7pyn,Fully skilled up and with good runes running spdhphp on despairfocus I found uses for her ToA as a stunner since she is light she will never glance due to elemental disadvantage so more chances to land despair or stun on second skill.  Plus attack break for  turns is decent considering there are few cleansers. ToA as a light tank ToA runs many dark mons especially bosses.  She can tank these forever and a day  its very helpful especially if you dont run belladeon. GWArena I take advantage of her leadership and push some all light attack teams.  I also reruned ahman to cut out the blade runes and crit rate on slot  and went shield and all HP  tanky as hell and heals quite well.  I will run lora l brig amp ahmanbella as an attack group.

If you can manage your CC with just Baretta  Vero as hard CC then youll have to sub out Hemos for another CC unit Shannon  Etc which will increase your stage times to around minutes in the later stages of TOA Hard  Especially water heavy stagesYoull have to swap Hemos out for stage  in place of a Healer Bella  Chasun  Etc and toss Vero on a DEFHPHP or DEFDEFHP build to tank  beat the Akromas.There are a few other trick stages but you can cross that when you get to them.If you are racing your friend unless you guys are shooting for a oneday clear Based off the title of the thread I doubt thats the case its more about how many floors you can convince yourself to grind through each day.You can clear in a day if you have the free time and patience but like most TOA Hard burns you out pretty quickly post .,summonerswar,d10iqj5,1,t5_324pd

Leo L Copper Talc or Delphoi Copper Talc.  My use of copper on D is sometimes Theo Chloe CopperWhat I do differently is the use of Vampirerevenge with  on Def.  The max dmg is only k with talc buff but you have a  man team dedicated to hammering Theo even with Theochasunhealer or TheoBernardDD setups.  With x Def and a def buff you will not lose your copper to a def break.  But I would still aim for bellas and such first since they wont have more than k hp,summonerswar,d17pz7z,1,t5_324pd

7043246,0,t1_d1elefq,I usually save crystals for refills and all but I do spend them on random summons every so often. The updates that made it easier to get exp boosters really helped since not having to spend crystals on them means I am often farming the limit of what my patience allows me while still keeping some crystals on the side for summoning sessions anyway.Also ToAobtained crystals have no use other than premium packs. As far as I am concerned ToA reset is that magical time of the month when I get to go wild with unrestrained summoning.Ironically out of my  summoned nat s only one of them was from those I know I shouldnt but... summons. The other  were from either scrolls obtained from natural shop refreshes scrolls directly obtained from ToA or scroll drops from dungeons. Cant really tell how many of my must have nat s came from those random summons though since I dont really keep track of that but its probably at least a bunch.,summonerswar,d1epjit,2,t5_324pd

7053227,0,t1_d1fu40j, Farming her AI fails to use S on cooldown. Thus she is a fairly slowunreliable farmer. GB her AI fails to use S on cooldown. Thus she doesnt really speed runs up much compared to using people who DO like Lushen. TOAN I run a heavy DPS Hwa and add in Theo if I need more damage. Arena her AOE speedclear sucks. Singletarget nukers are very far out of the arena meta in Galleon teams as well. I just TosiShimitae everything. GW one team is always GalleonL Purian Tosi the other is usually just Theo Bella Chasun or Hwa Bella Chasun. Ethna doesnt have as much room to shine here due to LS not working but she DOES shut down Theo pretty hard so that is nice.In general its just a combination of being out of the meta and really shitty AI on autobattle. About the most use I found for her was HoH and even then the lack of regular S usage and utility even on Despair led to me dropping her in favor of Sigmarus.Shes not a bad unit at all  just in a little bit of a rough spot right now mostly due to AI issues.

At first I thought my settings were wrong but they are not.Ive found that if I start loading the game without SWProxy and halfway through loading I switch to the proxy it will work fine. This takes incredibly precise timing though and is a real pain in the ass. I was okay doing this once a month for FRR but definitely not a regular thing.If I minimize SW at around the friend data or something message while loading and start the proxy it will work. If I am too fast or too slow it will not load correctly.Do you happen to know of the issue andor any way to get around it? Also I have two iPads that are basically only used for SW.

The main requirements are a fast enough Veromos ish with swift ish with violent and a Baretta with enough health aim for k.  Kill order would be LgtRgtBoss.  It will be slow but it should be pretty safe.  If your Veromos is too slow youll need Veromos  Konamiya for sure Veromos three healers and Briand will be safe but painfully slow.

With the def buff from basalt when they are about to hit you should be tanky enough to survive. If you cant even with that you are done. Also keep in mind that you must debuff de OGs glancing and att break ideally. You dont have either in your team. Your only change right now would be to make them not to hit you so use all your atb reducers. Try Baretta Mav spectra basalt and chloeBernard.

7148685,0,t1_d1qpljb,Acquila was a wet dream come true for me when I finally got him after a year of playing. The obvious reason why you bring it is the AoE strip. He was gold for me because he was my first AoE stripper. I runed him with Despair resulting in a strip followed by a stun chance yes it works that way which is just great.It was only later that I realized his other potentials. He goes so well with AoE damage dealers. Critrate buff and Attack buff those are the buffs you want and Aquila delivers. It allows you to build your AoE nukers on  CR without loosing anything so you can use your leader skill for better things namely speed or more damage. The awesome part is if you play him violent chances are that he does both strip and buff in the same turn which if your DDs are properly runed and your team is speedtuned usually means you win. On top of that he goes insane on violent with his first attack. It is not uncommon that I have my critbuff back up again even before it expired and my Aquila is not even maxed.So skills are nice now lets take a look at the base stats.  Speed is above average base speed so this is nice. He has close to . HP and close to  DEF means you can build him very tanky if you want. But at the same time he features  attack and has damage buffs in his kit so if you want to go nuts you can even throw in some damage and go wild with his st skills procs. He can be runed in many ways.The only thing i dislike is the Leader Skill which is rather generic.EDIT By the way he is a better buffer for Lushen than Galleon. Actually every monster with ignore defense is. So if you are building Kata and you have Lushen and Khali grab your Aquila and go wild!,summonerswar,d1qqdl1,4,t5_324pd

Can be built with revenge runes as your  set amazing for setting up against the aforementioned monstersAmir Very high damage output if youve got the appropriate team for an AoE wombo combo Bernard Galleon   Can farm Aiden Hell  pretty quickly with Vampire runes Can be runed despair and be a pretty deadly stunbot.None of them really have any massive cons. A lot of people have started building tech monsters to deal with Theomars although this is really only relevant at the top level Tesarion is fairly shit outside of his niche roles and Amir requires the proper team comp and decent runes to use.

Super stable runs I failed yesterday once no idea how I wasnt paying attention and looked over to see Vero soloing stage  crystals over  straight hrs of db.Briand draws a lot of fire from Zaiross plus he has an AoE attack break that stuns as well if you have him on Despair. Combine that with the fact that hes SUPER tanky he will eat the Dragons one shot revenge attack when a tower dies and keep going and has the best revive.As mentioned elsewhere in the thread the fact that his revive equalizes hp is HUGE. Sometimes things go tits up during Zaiross and Briand will straight up save DB runs I thought were not salvageable. One time I looked over at a failed db run Briand yes only Briand vs. Zaiross with DOTs. I let it keep going while I went to warm up some pizza. I come back  minutes later with my whole team alive at full hp as the right tower falls.Srsly Briand is MVP if you run a reviver.,summonerswar,d1wf801,2,t5_324pd

7239299,0,t1_d211oe4,Honestly at  star with a hp rune thats at least  you should have no problems since you have Eladriel. I personally use Verde so I cant give you an exact answer but my friend uses a similar team but with Briand and his Bernard is k hp. Bernard is naturally tanky with decent base defense so he should be fine even though he has element disadvantage. I do suggest you fuse a Sig though. My Sig pretty much never dies to the dragon at k hp with no hp leader buff and he nukes hard. Spectra requires decent runesaccuracy hp to survive boss speed crit rate and crit damage are all requirements. Though the crit isnt really an requirement if youre looking for speed you need that,summonerswar,d2120d9,1,t5_324pd

Fusing baretta wont do much for you right now focus on fusing veromos and six starring tyron as your main farmer and he will carry you. Look for light inugami on light days and get that wind griffon as well. Once you have those pieces you will progress much faster.

7320876,0,t3_4fmsjp,Everyone should make an informed choice based on their monster box and progression in the game before deciding which Hall of Heroes monster they will go for this coming weekend.My personal choice will be Aria despite the fact that I have the infamous combination of Spectra  GildongWoonhak which is no doubt an insanely strong combination when you are going through the stages. However the aforementioned combination of units requires you to play manually after a certain point which is not ideal for a player such as myself who hates grinding through the numerous floors in Trials of Ascension in both difficulties.The safety net provided by having Aria in my team which will allows me to build a rather safe and relatively fast fullauto team is the main reason as to why she is going to be my pick this time around. Her kit will be situationally useful outside of Trials of Ascension and it will definitely help having her around in some trouble floors. I have also been planning on working on Izaria who could use some extra skillups to reach her full potential. Aria is a great unit for me given my monster box and progression in the game. No other monster in the coming Hall of Heroes rotation will help me as much as she can in both short and long term.,summonerswar,d2ac04l,7,t5_324pd

I literally keep everything else but I personally prioritize HP and SPD the most since I have a metric crap ton of bruisers and few real DDs...nevermind that SPD is the one stat I can never get as a sub on runes but thats another matter entirely.,summonerswar,d2asd6w,1,t5_324pd

Her second and third skills do damage based on enemy max HP but if you look at the multipliers next to the skills you will see two numbers.  The first number is what it does based on attack this damage would be reduced and then add what it does from the second number based on enemy health this number will not be reduced.  The end result is that the damage is reduced but not by as much.  Same can be said about Marble if you look at his second skill however if you look at his third skill it has no multiplier on attack and would not be reduced by the attack debuff AFAIK.

And this itches the psychologist in me why?Why are people defending the fact it excludes a big part of the new players? I kid you not I tried to get some of my coworkers to play SW and because of how hard HoH was they got discouraged and left. Lost sales Im sure as these are big spenders on their other mobilecrack apps.Is this elitism? Is this a Stockholm syndrome situation? Is this the elite perpetrating the hierarchy and validating themselves with all the hard work and money theyve poured into the game by stopping someone to get a monster much easier than they did? I know the flame assassin is subpar but last HoHs monsters were gamechangers for many.I will always be proconsumer always. The corporations dont need defending. There SHOULD be a babys first HoH. It will encourage new players to have decent monsters to start with instead of having to go through the horrible monthslong grind that is to fuse a Veromos however that will mean less crystals bought less packs bought and this is a freemium after all.But Im not surprised about the company they are a business after all what Im surprised of is the players defending the captors of their time and wallets.Now if you excuse me I have to go back to farming that blasted desert for that blasted wind gryphon.,summonerswar,d34gnbw,1,t5_324pd

As far as what you said I didnt see any of that in the video. I stopped watching at the  minute mark because all I had seen so far was you showcasing your Nat fives. If you want constructive criticism then try leading the video with unique teams. I clicked because of the title. Watched for several minutes saw nothing unique and closed the video. The other  minutes might have been groundbreaking metashattering uniqueness but by that point you had already lost my attention as a viewer. I agree with Kaito being underestimated but you cant say the same for Delphoi especially against Theo teams. Same goes for Jultan I would argue a lot of people know to use him on Offense where you can force the enemy team to target him. Either way best of luck with future videos.

You will find yourself having a hard time to do rune upgrades if you mix in Giants with Dragons runes since it means you have to constantly switch back and forth to upgrade your runes.Why are you using Violent? Beginners should not be using Violent runes until they can at least run Gb auto and DB auto. Also if you are not getting at least  speed on Violent you are essentially wasting the use of Violent runes. If you are getting more speed on Swift Around  more on Swift then use Swift instead of Violent. Once you can do GB and you really want to do Dragons then farm Violent runes in DB.You should rune Shannon with Despair Focus. Despair can really help you stunning the trash mobs especially the deadly crystals. Focus on getting as much hp substats as possible.

Its best if you use crit rate or attack on slot  for Galleon to make it even faster thus safer and Verde there are quite a few ways to build him like spdCRatk atkCRatk with lots of speed and spdCDatk with lots of crit rate. I think the first one is the easier to build. For the other  I mentioned it can be Sig Theomars  Tarqs or Spectra as well.

This allows for interruptions between nukes i.e lets say you tried to double lushen a light panda team Assuming your runes are pretty good your Lushens are probably  spd which isnt exactly around the mark youd need to follow a  spd bernard but its enough to get by in most cases. By cutting the atb boost from your bernard in half the light panda gives the defending team a chance to say use chloe fanatic and completely fuck up your speed clear team.Its one of the few answers to the wombolushen teams and naturally it ends up being a LD nat.

Where youre going to have trouble is on the third stage if you cant get at least one of the crystals dead before they get their turn youre going to get that threeshot combo from the crystals plus Zaiross and one of your team is gone.  This is especially true without Verde and Sig on the team because youre only going to get one turn and nobodys capable of oneshotting those crystals.  Make sure your Bella goes before Vero and Hwa so she can hopefully land a defbreak that will make you more likely to get a kill before the enemy gets a turn.,summonerswar,d41abfq,2,t5_324pd

Id rather bring my Lushen than bring her when I cleave. Even when running galleon.Her third is a hard hitting nuke. Pretty much no one can say anything besides that. The problem is a single target nuke is nearly useless in the current meta so who gives a fuck?Everything listed here isnt what she is amazing at. Simply what she is passable at. With the exception of the single target nukestun.

Most monsters having the AOE on their nd Rakis Shi hou etc. just have a massive disadvantage to monsters that have a nuke on the second and AOE on their third e.g. Taor. I think CU should fix this. Comparing Taor to e.g. Shi hou is just ridiculous especially when realizing that that Taor nuke can hit for k which is as hard or harde than shi but has a CD of  turns and scales with speed meaning that its up pretty much all the time. Also the AOE is far superiour to the one of Shi good single target damage CC and decently good AOE damage.,summonerswar,d420gxx,1,t5_324pd

7897427,0,t1_d43jlfo,I played around between Chilling and Megan when I pulled the little blue guy. I put him on ViolentRev SpeedDefhp with some accuracy substats. While I kept him at  stars he was still a bit squishier than I liked so if I continued to use him I definitely woulda  starred him. I actually avoided skilling up Chilling since I wanted him to use his st skill more often but the increased uptime on his buffs may be worth it not too sure.Imo Chilling and Megan should ideally be a bit faster than Bella so that they will remove the immunity buff and Bella will be free to def break on his turn instead of Seizing. In the end I stopped using Chilling because I found that sometimes if I was unlucky his slow would screw up the boss stages attack order and sometimes the DoT tower would move right before the boss attacks and Id wipe because of it. That said the last time I touched him was several months ago and my monsters have definitely improved since then. Ill try a couple of runs with Chilling in a bit and see how they go.Edit My Chilling runs tended to be about  seconds slower than with Megan  vs  ish. My attacker is Sigmarus though and he doesnt benefit as much from Chillings buffs as he does from Megans so maybe Chilling could be a better choice for speed scaling units like your Taor.,summonerswar,d43qt1v,1,t5_324pd

The taunt would have been nice for the yettis but it doesnt blocks the revenge if they get buffedmonkeys revenge mav has stun on first skill.

He works perfectly fine at   also has a secret dungeon so hes easy to farm.  Defo work towards your Veromos summon asap.

8013218,0,t1_d4gqsba,Hes very devastating in GWO and GWD in the midlate game.People typically build him on Violent or Rage runes. HPCDHP or HPCRHP on .My Eshir is on violent. He has about k hp  speed  crit rate and  crit damage. His third skill hits for about k x with a defense break. Since I average about  crits I typically see him hitting for about k. Not too many high hp tanks out there that can also dish out this sort of damage.Ive been playing for about  months now. I pulled my Eshir about  months ago and havent found him to be of much use until I was able to farm DB for a couple months and get some decent runes.

The thing is my team is fine and survives if I have a  DEF  HP and RES lead which I can get with my supports but is hard with pugs.Why do you suggest Kona over lets say Dona?

I thought that he can be semiattacker but now Im thinking on replacing it to HP On very bad RNG Fei can use rd skill on one monster with ignore def and kill it May be skillups on Smokey can help more slowAlso I was thinking on building Fire Harpy instead of Fei for this team currently Fei outdamage Adrian too much. But Im not sure if I need it.Is it good starter team? What is the best ways to improve it Should I build Fire Harpy? Should I star smokey or it isnt required? Should I skillup smokey?

8181780,0,t3_4rdfon,Hugely overhyped Tyron Definitely Most overhyped monster ever in this game. He is okish I mean he is meant to be good for early game  speed lead aoe CC decent damage on his st skill but mostly RNG etc But thing is I cant find a good use of him at almost anywhere I go there are just plenty of other better options than what he could actually offer. He is still a decent backup option to be fair but just does nothing good enough for my liking. Dephoi I really do think so I see a lot of people rate her highly but I dont see how amazing she is after I  star her and give her some better runes. I mean she is viable front line tanker for R R etc but there are other better tanker out there who does lot more in raids. I heard she is also viable in GW as Theo counter or as support role in Copper comp but again there are many other better options too. What I really think is that she is solid and a decent option but also easily replaceable. Trevor for me he is He is an interesting toy to play around with he can solo farm and he could hit very hard in pvp when hes on low HP. Problem is he will never beat those aoe farmer or even Raoq in farming. And elsewhere in GW or arena you could never be sure he will win you the fight as he only hits hard on low hp that means he may be on the verge of actually dying himself instead of saving the whole universe. A very difficult monster to use in my opinion unless you have someone like Hwadam to protect him.Borderline overhyped Verde perhaps? I only find him very useful for DB and perhaps HOH too and thats about it. But he is still a very good monster to bring along though just not as godly as what people make him out to be. But he is still very unique and kind of gamechanging for early game just being overhyped too much. But then he maybe also good for realtime arena though so I will keep my mind open on this one. Chloe arguably I heard a lot of complain on Chloe being overhyped these days. Yes she is not as strong as what she used to be in AD or GWD as everyone do have an answer to counter her effectively. But apart from that she is still a good GWO monster to use to protect your slow nukers and perhaps even the best option when the enemy GWD doesnt have a stripper there which is very common. But outside of GWO setting most would agree she is overhyped. ,summonerswar,d509ted,3,t5_324pd

8205628,0,t1_d538ap8,I hear you man I was stuck on ToA  before FRR then started climbing thinking Id have plenty of time to tweak and push through hard floors The HoH announcement changed my plans so I went crazy yesterday pushing as hard as possible.To put it into context my Mikene like most of my mons is poorly runed too. sitting at k HP  crit  speed and  accuracy. She was basically there to ensure I could easily get to the boss revive Sig if something went horribly wrong but most importantly to S stragglers to ensure Verde was always CCd and ideally CC Spectras as well. But honestly anyone with a reliable single target CC stunsleepfreeze will do in her place in my succesful run I didnt use her SS at all she was literally just there to CC one at a time with her terrible speed.Not sure on what all your mons do but any  CC mon can fill her spot I think.Sig  Beth situation Im honestly not sure about how the compare I imagine your Beth does more damage and has more sustain than my Sig so on that front its a solid choice to zerg down CCd fire mons. But while Leo can break loose once or twice without a wipe Verde has to be locked up and killed he nearly always wiped me when one of them got loose with a Spectra. And on that front Sig and his ability to CC was useful and attack break on his S helped maintain the calm when more than  mons were loose.You may well have more options than I can recognize as a noob. But the idea is VeroBaretta can keep Leo out of play easily enough Bella is a must for healdefense break. The last two should be ideally  DD with a semi reliable CC and  CC bot ideally with multiple CCs. Hopefully the latter  being Water mons. Id honestly try maybe MikeneBeth  times or so and see if its possible youll soon know if you have a chance or just get obliterated.,summonerswar,d539axo,1,t5_324pd

8227300,0,t1_d55w7fv,Its obviously a bit of a reach to assume that no new monsters are released because CU moved all its assets into transmogs. None of us know the inner workings of CU and even then its too simplistic for the reasons you mentioned.On the other hand I dont think you can dismiss it as coincidental either that transmogs were introduced very shortly after CU announced indirectly by stating that HOHs will be repeated for lack of new monsters that they will slow down on new monster releases. And its also clear that transmogs translate into money very directly.Its up for debate how often new monster releases would be healthy for the game but I dont think you can argue against the fact that there are too little. We havent gotten a new nat since the Halloween update in October . Only  nat and  nat in the past half year. Given how adverse CU is to making sweeping balance changes to put it mildly this is a huge contribution to why the game has felt stale to so many people. New monsters were what shaped the meta and kept the game fresh.Monster pool dilution is not a sound argument against releasing new monsters IMO. One the one hand you have exclusive summons to allow you to hunt for specific monsters on the other hand summoning new monsters instead of the old staples is not a bad thing if they are designed well enough. ,summonerswar,d55yvzf,1,t5_324pd

The second app is a UI that uses that information. You select a monster from your list and there are dropdown menus for rune slots types stats etc. You tell tell it what stat you want for each slot and what stats to focus on for subs.

8310805,0,t1_d5gdvd3,You should always awaken angelmon before you use them and then feed them to their respective elements. You should also make sure your angelmon are max level  before feeding as well as thats the most efficient. I dont believe you can evolve angelmon though so just awakening and leveling them to  should be enough.As for when you should use them thats up to you. Theres no real wrong choice here. I prefer to save them for right after I evolve a unit to  or  usually  for king angelmon since higher evolved monsters take longer to level.And for you devilmon I would save it. Tuck it away in storage for now. You should only ever feed devilmon to natural  or natural  monsters.  and  monsters are relatively easy to find. It might take a while but you can get all the  food to skill up your units from unknown scrolls and the mystic scrolls you get as drops so its not worth using a devilmon on them.Nat  or nat  monsters are really rare though so its not that feasible to wait for a duplicate to show up. Save your devilmon for them.For the intermediate packs Id say they are worth buying if you have the pocket change for them. Youre really buying them for the crystals though not the scrolls or mana. The second right option is the most cost efficient and the  legendary scrolls will guarantee you some nat  monsters meaning you wont have to spend  crystals on a summoning pack to hope for one. Its a really good deal for your situation actually. If you do buy it I wouldnt suggest buying a summoning pack after for that reason as you would ideally get what we needed and instead focus on using that plethora of crystals on refills so you can quickly progress through the game.Glad I could help. ,summonerswar,d5geoun,1,t5_324pd

I also raised the speed on everyone on my necro team to a minimum of  speed with the exception of hwa who sits at about . I have some wiggle room to raise my hwas speed but should I build another rakshasa so Im not limited to  speed? If so which rakshasa should I build?  My current necro team is mono first except for Bella so I think Ran would be the best fit. I also have yen and su. My current team is Shihwa L Adrian Bella Colleen and Hwa. Would this be my ideal Raid team?Currently Plan on  starring Lanett to runFrontline Darion and LanettBackline Lisa Hwa Bella and ColleenI can currently beat r with a poor excuse of a raid team. I was considering building Ariel for raids but I dont know if he is better than Bella in terms of smart healing. Not to mention his heal over time buff. Here is a link to my box My Lisa is around  speed and  resistance on Violent but my speed totem is only at like level . Colleen is at  speed and Bella is at about  speedslot  is only at Finally what would the ideal build for frontline Lanett be?I dont think full revenge would be ideal because her st skill doesnt offer any debuffs in return. Therefore I was considering using combinations of energy and guard so I can still reach the stat requirements for r while dedicating more subs into more speed andor resistance. Another alternative would be swift so less subs into speed and more into hpdef or violent for more turns. Sorry for the text wall and thanks in advance!,summonerswar,d5h5ezg,1,t5_324pd

But as i said nat s are free noone is charging people so they can pull them. Giving such a thing for free wouldnt benefit the devs while putting on a price tag would pretty much screw the game as it would mostly benefit the heavy cashers who have loads of duplicates or unwanted nat s that they can gamble away until they get everything. Besides how can they stop people from fusing nat s and using them to gamble because they can also be pulled from scrollsAlso copies or not every monster family is unique so for example hell ladies who most consider horrible would be pretty much fed right away. ,summonerswar,d5ji9c3,1,t5_324pd

8349007,0,t1_d5l5dpb,Unless youre still at early game its generally better to spend your crystals on refills for DBGBNB runs than for summons anyway.  You can do very well in arenaGW with well runed farmablefusable mons whereas poorly runed Nat s will only get you so far.  Of course well runed Nat s are what youd need to really compete in the really high end arena but thats just the nature of the game.Note that by spamming refills for dungeons you also pickup MS here and there from drops as well as building up a ton of mana  refreshing shop for scrolls when youre overflowing with mana isnt a bad idea either.If youre really hurting for summons by all means pick up some scrolls and pieces  but Id suggest at least setting aside some of the points each week for flags as opposed to completely neglecting them.  I used to be in a farming guild and later on progressed to a G guild  and if I could go back time I wouldve started investing in the flags much earlier than I did.  They really do help but takes forever to upgrade.,summonerswar,d5l6g6f,2,t5_324pd
8349939,0,t3_4tyff9,This chart?It clearly shows that in Faimon NORMAL its a . chance of getting a  monster. Now faimon actually has  of them so divide those chances in half and you get about . chance of getting a fire inugami. This coincides with the data from SwarfarmFor Faimon HARD those chances go up to where its about a . chance of getting a fire inugami.In Faimon HELL its a . chance.So just looking at getting inugami skill ups your best bet is Faimon HELL.Now to talk about energy. The energy return for each run is about the same . energy per run. However if you look at my first link its pretty clear that Faimon Hell is more efficient in terms of exp per energy.So from a PURE efficiency standpoint Faimon Hell is definitely the way to go. Faimon Hard would be next and then Faimon Normal.Now you said you didnt care about speed but if you were to care in my first link there is a sheet that allows you to input your clear times to see how much xp you will get per hour. When I put  seconds in for Faimon Hard and  seconds in for Faimon Hell Faimon Hard is the clear winner. Im getting almost triple the amount of xp in an hour using my Raoq in Hard than I am using my Theo in Hell. Of course this doesnt account for the fact that I have to hit Replay and Start Battle a LOT more often farming Hard rather than Hell so its probably closer to double than triple if you were to factor in the time between runs.,summonerswar,d5lang7,2,t5_324pd

You can do them sooner but it slows down your general progress especially because ing something at your stage generally takes a lot of work.Do you have Gb done?  If not focus on that Vero Bella Shannon Bernard KonaAhman ?.

What were saying is instead of you massively flopping when you didnt crit since your CR is pretty low for PvP you now deal good damage EVERY time. Sure thats not the k hit youre used to but if thats such a huge deal PvP burst you really should be running  CR. In the end overall she does the SAME damage MORE consistently. If theres an issue with the damage output due to you needing the extra burst sprint in your words damage please modify your runes accordingly. Even if you dont youre more likely to do more damage on average anyway. Think of all those times you didnt crit with her S and hit like a noodle. That WILL NOT happen anymore.

8518985,0,t3_4wejdp,People are pissy. You should use the search button in the future but jesus they took the time to comment might as well help you for now.Yeah hes amazing. In arena you want to go first usually especially if youre running a wombo combo team. A typical arena offense team is a monster with a speed lead skill a bernard thats as fast as you can get it galleon and an aoe nuker.You hope your bernard is the first monster to move and then you use his skill to increase your teams atk bars so that they all move before the enemy. You get to def break and then use your nuke which should kill their defense.Thing is Bernard only fills  of your attack bar so your monsters have to have  or more of your bernards speed. When your bernard is  speed that means . If your bernard is  that means . Its not easy to get aoe nukers to move that fast while still dealing good damage.But! Frigate fills  of your attack bar! That means even if hes  speed you only need your mons at  which is WAY easier to do. His base speed is only  less than bernards too. So if you face a bernard youll have a bit of a disadvantage but not much. With a swift set speed lead and maxed speed totem youre still only like  or  speed slower. That wouldnt matter till like guardian. Things like the water inferno also buff  of your attack bar but have like  base speed which makes them FAR slower than bernardlike potentially  speed and the other team will far more easily move before yours. ,summonerswar,d66fmlt,0,t5_324pd

8534441,0,t3_4wlu87,I just cleared TOAH my first time about an hour ago! The team I used was Vero Bella Collen Hwa and Basalt. Since you dont have a Colleen built yet I would try Baretta Verde Basalt Hwa and Bella. This will only work if your Hwa is a damage Hwa though since you need her to outDPS the bosss heal. Spectra works well maybe even better than Hwa as a DD but you might need to  him for him to be able to survive. You could also try Baretta Hwa Bella Aria and Basalt. Aria isnt very good for the boss though so dont use her third skill on him. I am only suggesting Aria for her heal block which will make it go faster since then everyone can attack the boss instead of just Hwa.Anyway for general strategy dot up the right tower and just use Hwa to slowATB reduce the boss. Use Basalts third and Barettas second on him whenever you need to. If the boss is about to move or the right tower is about to move try to put up Basalts def buff so that everyone can easily survive. Also dont be afraid to use Bellas heal as an ATB boost when you need. Best of luck you can do it!,summonerswar,d68dct2,1,t5_324pd

Most of us have been through being booted instantly in pugs but just because you dont get booted doesnt mean you should still raid with the folks in the room without looking at their team comp first.  From Yolo folks running searahwalisa to no dps folks running essentially Xiong both of those are potentially risky teams depending on runes.

You might subconsciously believe that those substats drop more frequently than others as they are the least desirable substats to have on a rune in most cases and thus those runes tend to be more memorable than the average midtier rune almost no one keeps e.g. a rune with HP and CD substats or SPD and RES. ,summonerswar,d6kpnn5,5,t5_324pd
8633035,0,t3_4y3qlv,I would say  yes MOST of the game but with very important caveats.Fatal is a perfectly serviceable nuker set and the best for speed teams until very high grindstone totals and Swift is a great set on its own but youre limiting yourself to ONLY running speed teams in arenaGW and will probably struggle a lot in NB and raid  without good Revenge runes at the very least ideally Shield and Vio runes as well since they have many uses in PVE and PVP alike. And youre probably not doing much NB without any VioRev runes so Will cleave squads are definitely out of the question.You can ignore NB outside of high level PVP but DB is sooooo useful for all PVE that youre definitely hurting yourself by ignoring it.,summonerswar,d6kqitj,1,t5_324pd

8668164,0,t3_4ynqg9,Tbh I would rather eliminate or nerf monsters like theo or orion first simply because of the random way they can make every fight  almost no matter what are the comps. These are more cancerous than bernard but in the end I dont really mind.  I dont think having a speed meta which I dont think exists is bad. Every monster benefits from speed which is arguably the only true universal stat so people who have put a lot of effort or  and luck see their speed stat grinding profit.    Speed tuning is an interesting mechanic. If everyone had almost the same speed arena would be determined by who has the best nat  tankbruiser.    Bernard just happens to be a speed god.

8704192,0,t1_d6tkxgj,You should  him just to make the defense look scarier. A lot of arena defenses are about mind games when you dont have the runes to back it up just yet. As it is you could potentially hold fighter  but Id toss in something that could help you do more damage instead of Chasun like a Galleon or even Alicia. If you happen to have a galleon Id also change megan out for bernard. A yolo defence with a guaranteed faster bernard is likely to deter most people looking for a fast win during rush hour. ,summonerswar,d6tnow9,1,t5_324pd

8713470,0,t1_d6url0a,That is ... well i am not sure what that is somewhere between a starter team and a speed team i guess but with all the wrong parts of both.  Since you have verde and you are new to db do verde lead vero bella kona and a rezzer.  Try right then boss if that doesnt work left right boss.  If everyone in that team is  with moderate runes you will be  db with  to  minute runs.  The rezzer kona or both can be  but your success rate will go down.  Just about any rezzer will work i dont say a rezzer might not work anymore because as soon as i do a dozen people inform me that rezzer does just fine in this combo only one that hasnt been true for is dark undine but i am sure some crazy person out there made dark undine work with this team.  Maybe the light death knight? Seems like it would be hard for auto to get his rez to work.  But i digress briand is awsome of course mikene is farmable and also awsome teon works if you kept him literally any rezzer.  ,summonerswar,d6utkb9,1,t5_324pd

8758525,0,t3_501p0u,A few friends tips First off you can only add people on your server. Generally when asking for friends on reddit you should indicate which server you are on. Next You generally want high level friends so that you can use their reps to help you with the content. You can use each friends rep day. However it can be tricky to add high level guys because most of us want other high level friends to help farm. If youre on my server tell me your username and Ill add you. Taor reps are awesome and mine is better. However if youre inactive for more than  days you may get deleted. Dont fill up your friends list and keep a handful of slots open. If you pull a Secret Dungeon you may see requests in chat asking to be added some of the SDs are more valuable than others. Generally any monster that is needed for a fusion recipe will get add requests also the dark yeti light inugami and light vagabond will get lots of requests.

If what youre looking for is just purely healing there are other better monsters like ColleenLulu etc. Likewise for Vero if you need just a cleanser there are better options like Kona. Sure double VeroBella means there will be double defense breakstun etc but it isnt really needed. A nd VeroBella would be phrased out really soon.In GB the X which is normally a healer or damage mitigation will be replaced by a DD quickly probably with just about  weeks of farming in GB. In DB Kona would be better than a nd Vero since Kona heals as well and has elemental advantage so his runes doesnt need to be as good as Veros.

8804061,0,t1_d763j8r,Keep runes that have a good combination of primary stat and substats even if it doesnt make sense as part of the rune set. Good stats used as a broken set can often give you better total overall stats than getting a set bonus. For example a Fatal rune with HP primary and substats like DEF SPD RES ACC could still be great on a support mon as a broken set.ACC primary stat is not generally that great since you either need  ACC for PvE or  for PvP if you need to debuff a  resist target. PvE stats are pretty easy to attain from substats so youll be better off with HP DEF ATK etc. on slot  rune. ACC runes need some really good subs to make up for the loss of a better primary stat.Fatal and Blade DEF runes can be great for DEF based attackers such as Fire Frankenstein Wind Living Armor or Fire Panda. Many of them still have some ATK scaling on skills so a Fatal set can still be useful. Rage is obviously better than Fatal for such mons once you can farm Necro but you probably arent there yet.,summonerswar,d764ncx,1,t5_324pd

8810872,0,t1_d76qdzt,so from what I have pieced together from his threads and others like it is the most common issue was with how the password resets work from comus.  If you know the persons Hive ID which can be found just be sending a friend request all you have to do is say you forgot the password and then you get teh  digit code that you have to enter to type a new one.  That field did not have a limited number of attempts so brute forcing  digits that are all alpha numeric and lower case is roughly a  second effort.  And then you provide a new password no matter how strong the old one was.To prevent people from just doing that back then they went to the account settings and changed the HIVE ID and deleting all friends so the original owner cannot find what the new HIVE ID is.  This also prevented comus from locating the account to recover it.,summonerswar,d76y3tr,2,t5_324pd

8845248,0,t1_d7b2f8t,Well the Hellhound has quite a nice buff when awakened which gives CR and ATK to your entire team. At your stage of the game CR is very hard to come by so a  boost is essentially an entire free rune. Ranger on the other hand has the special skill of doing extra damage to sleep stunned and frozen targets. The problem is you dont really have a good way of doing so. He stuns but not super often as you most likely dont have skillups for him. He does pretty nice damage though so maybe hell be okay. Charger shark is actually pretty good now that I look at him. He provides good damage and a decent amount of utility as he self CR buff does AoE ATK break and Slow and a single target DEF break. I would say when you want to replace a unit it would most likely be the Water Fairy for the Charger Shark but for now I think you might need the extra healing. I chose the Fire Hellhound over the other two essentially because hes less greedy and provides a boost to your entire team. The Ranger is very selfish in terms of his skills and Fire Charger shark is good and you may want to replace the Water Fairy for him later.You do need to awaken that Hellhound to get the buff skill though maybe you can try him after and see how you like him.,summonerswar,d7b2nnm,2,t5_324pd

8853772,0,t3_51i0d8,Probably noone has given you a clear answer because a lot of options are viable if runed correctly but i will try to express my thoughts as to what i think of the best hoping they are correct somehow.Colleen  Heal attack break and the most important dehealing.Secondary healer is probably your best many use Chasun others have praha...see its the rune thing.DPS Somewhere i saw a list with the most reliable dps for raids and i believe Hwa was the most usablereliable one on swift not violent. Kung fu girls have also made their appearances with their insane damage. If your dps is well runed a lot of options are viable as well.Cleanser I believe Anavel and Konamiya are the best simply because they cleanse on a  turn cooldown. Every other usable cleanser is on  turns and i hear thats a good advantage. On top of their cleanse they also heal which can help things out.Tanks DarionDias due to their passive even though a lot of times they are under oblivion. After that panda fire because its accecible heals and has high base stats.I hope my writings are correct,summonerswar,d7c3jde,1,t5_324pd

8859837,0,t3_51k12k,I guess everyone is probably busy trying the new raids but it would be nice if somebody could give me a hand with ToAH . I cleared the Atharos rotation last time and maybe I simply cant do it but I want to know if I just got bad RNG in which case I would carry on. I have tried almost every possible combination I can think of and followed several of the guides mentioned here but none work. In  out of  cases I get the red incarnation. Bella cant keep up with the heals and if I use Chasun I have no defense break and cant kill her in time. If I get the green incarnation there is no way I can keep her Atb down. I have yet to get the blue one  I think I might have a shot if I get her but RNG doesnt like me. I have no problems with her splits so I dont need Tesarion here.My normal team for ToA consists of Baretta Aria BellaChasun Verad and Mav. For this I have changed Aria to Spectra to actually be able to inflict some damage although I also tried Aria and it didnt work. I have also tried Hwa instead of Spectra but she cant keep Lyrith down alone mine is one a somewhat tanky nonvio build for raids.Anyway  If somebody could have a look and give me some advice that would be nice.

However since he has a lot of game knowledge and likes to theory craft he was able to create a team that legitimately could beat it that fast.

There are a few scattered mentions of using him on ADGWD and almost all of them from before he was buffed.If you take the time to read my post you will see that I ask specifically about how the current meta affects these outdated discussions and if anyone has more recent information.Unless you have difficulty with reading comprehension.....?,summonerswar,d7pjkbl,1,t5_324pd

But for those of us who have generated or autogenerated Hive IDs already this method doesnt prevent being hacked. Once an account is assigned a HiveID it is permanently exposed until the exploit pathways are fixed.Additionally for Facebook login having no Hive ID can make account recovery take longer in the event Facebook deletes your account. Our guildie used a dummy Facebook exclusively to log in to SW Facebook banned the account and it took two weeks from ticket submission to recovery because he had no Hive ID.

9030008,0,t3_53y7vo,An automated system that recognizes such spam might not be that easy to implement so human interaction like a reporting feature would be needed e.g. to ban the accounts that are used for that. The censoring system currently in use basically has similar problems i.e. it doesnt understand the message and just checks for bad words like ass. We all agree that the current system is just stupid but a more intelligent system is harder to implement and it only has to deal with single words. Now imagine a system that has to recognize scam it would be hard to do right e.g. you could block any url posts but scammers would just do things like ww w. bad scam site. com and the system couldnt be sure its an url or a mistyped sentence.The best bet would probably be a reporting system but there are at least  problems with that a reporting system might be misused by idiots just reporting for nothing or if players have some sort of fight going on banning the accounts would not stop the scammers theyd just create new accounts,summonerswar,d7x9j1j,2,t5_324pd

Unfortunately it takes around  minutes per run. Ive seen some posts about Sigmarus being able to reduce that time by  minutes? This drove me to start trying to make one. Is it the same set up with swift  a set? Or is he built a little differently?I know Im jumping the gun here but after consistent GB runs and finding some suitable runes for my team Im probably going to tackle DB. I have Verdehile thats just sitting in my storage. Should I  him when Im content with GB runes?Lastly when leveling up  units whats the fastest approach? I usually take  mon that can solo the hardest Hell stage it can do and  of the mons I want to level up. Is that the fastest approach or are there other methods that Im missing out on?Thank you again in advance!,summonerswar,d82thgs,1,t5_324pd
9076338,0,t1_d82i4x7,Theres not exactly an amazing lore. But its fun.Galleon was a very powerful warship the th century. Very common warship and heavy also. It was meant to war.You can relate that to the fact Galleon is a indeed a war machine. Remember Galleon opens up the patch for everyone to loot.Carrack was a sailling ship. But if Im not wrong they were the most commonly used and were topnotch when it comes to Cargo. They worked in large crews and could also work with cannons. But they werent first meant for combat. However they were the first ships to be mounted with guns in the hull and could ALSO be used as warships although that wasnt common.You could check the old Mary Rose ship! Barque is a simple threemasted ship. Its more suited for sailing since it requires much less crew members to sail when compared to fullrigs. All in all they were lighter and therefore quicker. Most intended for sailing purposes.Must be why Barque is really fast as a mob.Brigs were twomasted ships that were meant for sailling. They were extremely quick and less dependant on the wind although he required very skilled men to sail. They were mostly sailling and merchant ships but could be used for combat purposes but less efficient in doing so. Frigates was a threemasted warships. It had some amazing maneuverability and could be used for a lot of purposes from bombardment as well as escorting. They werent topnotch when it comes to facing larger warships but in comparison they were better to work with on a smaller crew.,summonerswar,d82tu8r,3,t5_324pd

9079048,0,t1_d82kirw,I pretty much have played as efficiently as possible for the  months Ive played.  Only doing toa once free entry is up then finishing after.Only farming SDs when I need specific skill ups inefficient as food sourceEvolving monsters with skill up food as much as possible.Only use  monsters to finish off maxing monster levels if you mass feed them you need even more  to keep up and its mana intensiveDoing all of this I was routinely out of scrollsfodder and I spend a LOT of time in dungeons.  I basically am forced to farm SDs just to keep up with free  monthly x exp gifts now which gives more mana BUT has more crystals  energy used because its very inefficient expenergy.Not sure which is better in the long run... but I am positive new players dont have the game knowledge or ability to farm b hoh like I do to adjust to the changes.,summonerswar,d835k86,1,t5_324pd

9083021,0,t1_d83lwvg,I never said that you cant make a statement all I said was that your statement is false if you cant back it up. All the monsters you listed dont just have a single target nuke andor they have a different type of nuke then theo. For example Raki is antirevive and has an aoe armor break. If all you need is a single target nuker then yes theo is better but Raki is better in other ways. My point is that that they are different and used for different things. I believe that zaiross is better than theo in general. Does that make theo trash? No they are used in different places and have different niche although i do agree that Daphnis needs a buff.,summonerswar,d83mqor,1,t5_324pd

9088950,0,t1_d84ahud,There is no trade whatsoever in this in game and anyone saying otherwise is a scammer.Secret dungeons is a friend system thing you are randomly rewarded one when doing the elemetal dungeons. If a friend of yours unlocks one then you are able to enter it as well. People will mostly request those that are a fusion requirement like dark yeti and fire bounty hunter. Hence when someone unlocks one people request to be friended in order to enter.Using your friends reps is a very good thing. Lucky you to have lv  ones I would use those to carry me through the campaign one stage at a time per day. The exp you obtain from a stage is evenly divided but rep monsters dont take exp so you level  faster when using them. I dont remember which stage gives runes as a reward but when you get that choose the energy set and ramagos at  stars should be able to solo any hell map on garen forest. When able farm the boss for  energy runes with  hp stats.If you can be patient save up to  crystals and buy the bigger bundle. If you want to invest a bit of money then I suggest the growth package. Buying mystical scrolls is actually the least efficient way of spending the crystals however I do highly recommend to at the very least buy   bundles  ms total to get some  to work with perhaps even possibly a nat  or .After that save them up to buy exp boosters and refills. Your most efficient leveling spot is determined by your ramagos power hydeni ruins hell has a very low requirement  and you are looking forward to farm aiden forest with that same ramagos eventually. Garen forest is fine for now.I like to write this because even though this info is out there most of this stuff I learnt on my own and I really wished to have known earlier.

9108772,0,t1_d86pmsh,Thanks a lot for your feedback. I was just wondering tho do you use sig as your farmer as well ?Im currently using veromos which farms faimon hard with  fodders easily in seconds. I imagine if Sig can one shot everything that he should be a lot faster.  crit rate can go a long way in achieving that.,summonerswar,d86q74z,1,t5_324pd
9108806,0,t1_d86q74z,Yes i farm faimon hard with  fodders in  sec with sig. Time vary a LOT because of AI  sometimes he uses aoe at the end of each wave and i take  sec sometimes he open up on aoe clear second wave with single target open last wave with aoe and clear in  sec. But average is around  sec. He does one shot anything including with aoe its more a question of when he uses his aoe and how many turns the ennemy takes wasting time.My stats for ref using now blade blade focus  ish hp ish def  spd cr  CD  atk  acc. Spammed blade runes with crafts from giants which helped getting some really nice blade runes  but going blade  you can achieve something similar with a bit less spd acc and maybe atk and cd and be almost as efficient. Edit Sig is  of the damage of my whole team in dungeons easily even accounting for vero dots. On dragon his third can hit for k if def break second skill for k when vero hits for k bella for k the others less than a k. The damage boost your team get is insane ,summonerswar,d86qcf7,1,t5_324pd

9115734,0,t3_554rie,In the interest of maximizing your time dont focus on doing too much with everything you have currently. Your Wind Pixie is highest priority if youre looking to begin building mons for mid game and beyond and your Fire Hellhound will become useful periodically. Basically everything else isnt worth much except for perhaps Lapis Water Magic Knight as a farmer down the road. Find a Konamiya Water Garuda and drop that light garuda like a bad habit. Find a Colleen Fire Harpu asap as well as a Bernard Wind Griffon. If you find a Mav Wind Penguin and a Spectra Fire Griffon hold onto those and store them away.   The biggest thing you can do with your time right now is get reps from other players. Max your list out at  with usable monsters to power you through the scenarios and to begin farming. Dont worry about the crystals right now honestly those are much more valuable later than they are now IMO. Sure pulling a Chasun or something right now would be awesome but most of these guys you wont have the runes to make full use of just yet. Focus on the basics of a core group get those level them up and focus everything you have on the Veromos Fusion grind as it will become a gamebreaker for you. Come Sunday try to get into the Secret Dungeons for Light Warbear Ahman Light Vagabond Darion and Light Inugami Belladeon. Couple those guys with basically everyone else Ive mentioned and you have the basis for your first GB team in a few months time.    Also something most people forget to tell newcomers Try not to rush in this game youll burn yourself out. This game simply cannot be rushed since it submits itself to so much to RNG on basically everything that exists in game. Try not to get too sidetracked with leveling everything up. I did a bad thing early on in my game and tried to make everything a  to the point that I became a solid month or two behind average progression because I lacked the s and proper runes to move forward. Try to plan for the long game here and youll find this game breezes by when you stay focused on your goals. Also ComUS knows this so they will drop events on you left and right that will sidetrack the shit out of you for awesome prizes like their  drop rate on mids from the last event.

9117234,0,t1_d87qiww,Absolutely. General consensus is that as an earlymid game player there is no better mon to put them into. I sat on Vero unskiled for a long time at  max then d him and wasnt too thrilled due to my lack of runes mostly. Skilled him up and it was a night and day difference.  Also he does so much of your damage early on in GB as you go through the rune grind that no other monster will truly outpace or outshine his usefulness for quite a long time. Your first GB team will mostly look like VeromosL Bella  Bernard Shannon DarionKonamiya until you complete the Sig fusion andor get enough runes and fodders to just toss a Lushen or Orochi into the fray if you dont have a sig by then. ,summonerswar,d87qsk6,1,t5_324pd

9121086,0,t1_d881k1y,i disagree that Baretta brings speed lead and nothing else.Im pretty sure Baretta is the best mon to use in a tower comp when you are going L gt R gt boss. his s is going to be doing most of the damage on both towers and his s when targetting the left tower will reduce the amount of dots vero has to clear. IMO bella causes more deaths at dragon than baretta because he defence breaks the tower which lets your mons hit it harder with straight attack.

9123143,0,t1_d884agn,I currently use her for AD and GW as a bruiser runed HPCDHP WillShieldShield. This makes her a tanky fire monster with still enough firepower to  shot a lushen without needing def break or at least thats the goal. I dont think shes that great of a monster but at least she is useable and serves some sort of role.The bruiser build also manages to make full use of her entire skillset. S is useful since Im going for an extended fight and not trying to win in  turn.

9154384,0,t1_d8cb5cr,Oh nice then you are set to just farm DB until you get some better violent runes.  RIP battery until then.I dont think Rage is necessary for Sig.  You could easily just use a Fatal set from GB with good CD subs and a blade  set.  Alternatively if youve got a good DD set of violent that is how I run mine.  Violent Blade AttCDAtt with barely under k hp and only  speed.I personally wouldnt dive into Necro for a while as its mostly good for PVP.  I would go DB face team first.  Not only will farming DB lead to improving your DB team but you can build a necro team off of nothing but DB leftovers.You can take a look at my stats for a general idea but like I said its a bit overkill in some places.

Make sure to meet  SPD on Megan  on vio for VeroBella  bit slower than VeroBella on Verde as much as you can get on Theo he is preferably faster than Verde as well.  Vero Bella Megan should have  acc nonwater mons k HP and water mons at least k HP tho you can get away with like k on Theo because he is Theo.

9174452,0,t1_d8evegs,yes i do. it doesnt matter if you doubt it or not you simply dont know it.I work as a software developer and believe me before something gets released it usually gets tested to death because its quite an embarrassment releasing mistakes.just like with the nat Sky Dancers idea they wanted to do it at first but scratched it since it probably would create unwanted side effects of the one guys having their LD nat buffed but the other guys having theirs nerfed.gt because i doubt it. they apply one cooldown decrease to a skill run the code once or twice and check if it worked. doneagain you simply have no idea what youre talking about. you can decrease the cooldown by one and run the code to check if it worked of course it will otherwise the code wouldnt compile and you couldnt run the game but what actually matters is will this  CD create other imbalances? Like what they did to Theo they added the Endure buff to his passive although he was perfectly fine as he was but would we have all the QQ about Theo if they wouldnt have done it? No. But the thing is it can be countered and is not an unbeatable imbalance and many different factors play a role such as the rest of the team and the runes.gt its not like implementing new mechanics where you have to debug code hundred of times in order to make it work. its working code where you just change parameters for the most part.this is called bug fixing. balance patches are not bug fixes but as mentioned earlier they need thorough testing. If you still dont get what I and others say in regards to balancing is hard go play Jenga and see if you can just move bricks around here and there and be done.,summonerswar,d8exgtk,1,t5_324pd

I have had some really crappy luck with vio unfortunately. Your Velajuel is also on some serious speed.  Mine is only in the  range my best violent runes are Lisa and Mihyang for raids and Sekhmet for AD all hp runes not atk or cd sadly.

If you can manage to get some hp substats then change slot  to a crit rate rune.Once you do that she should be able to farm faimon normal  and when you get her to the preferred rune build I mentioned first she should be able to do faimon  hard.Hopefully by that point you should be able to replace lapis.Look into getting and leveling a wind warbear and make him your farmer as he can do aiden hell  and hydeni hell  with mediocre energy runes.,summonerswar,d8x4jqf,1,t5_324pd

9328964,0,t1_d8yig0j,Hmm it looks like youre right on the ACC being fine since  is the break point. One thing that you are starting to lack since youre tackling ToAH is SPD. And Violent may help of course but not necessary.Not that itll help you right now but I would focus on speeding Baretta up and even possibly Briand. You dont actually need him super tanky for ToAH and the extra  SPD you can give him is quite nice. Main problem is that Mav is much too slow. I would say that have him go right after Baretta but speed Baretta up to  and get Mav around there too. Just because you want Mav slow on your team doesnt mean you get to neglect his SPD! Mine is at  before any bonuses and he works great.Hathor teams might work but I dont have too much experience with it since you cannot use DoT and have the sleep stay on.

9349043,0,t3_58fkbz,Hello everyone! New to Reddit so sorry if I brake any unspoken rules or make myself look like a dork! AnywaysIve recently started playing this game again and I thought I had a little bit of an idea on what to do. Well come to find out I had zero idea on what I shouldve been doing. As of right now Im working on my GB team because as a level  summoner with horrid and I mean horrid runes I feel ashamed. Ive been pretty lucky with my pulls and I want to be able progress using those pulls. My main goal right now is my recently fused Veromos. He isnt awakened yet and he has a decent violent set on him with a  speed rune on slot  but a focus set of  runes in  slots being HP which is terrible. I would like to get him on a swift focus set so I can have him carry me through Giants and as my other monsters get better have them carry him through Dragons and his Violent set. All that said here is my box  I desperately need help on knowing what should be my next step to reaching my goal. I know anyone can say use the standard team of Vero Bella Bernad Shannon  as your entry team. Yes Im aware I can take another month or two to build and form that team. But thats not what I would like if I can help it. I can farm GB at  minutes right now . Not that big of a deal and I dont get runes that are good enough half the time. Most of my runes so far have been from the shop. My Camilla is capable of soloing the GB completely with a decent success rate but takes forever to do so. For some reason she cant carry the team when I try to bring in help for her.  Alright I guess ranting aside here is my question. With the monsters I have in my box right now that I have built can anyone think of a comp that would allow me to farm GB for runes to build a better GB team as I farm it? Or am I just simply gonna have to farm GB build up the dream team everyone always talks about and inch my way up there?Honestly I just have no idea on how to play this game anymore. I have zero clue on what I should be doing in this point of the game. I  n e e d  help. Thank you for the time you spent reading this.,summonerswar,d9124qs,1,t5_324pd

If Im unhappy and the objective of a game is to relieve stress or for enjoyment I find a solution which in some cases is look for another game. Quitting is a solution. If your boss docks your pay and tells you that he cant pay you for much longer because youre no longer worth your paycheck what are you going to do? Stay and get underpaid or look for another job? Of course you could say youre going to upgrade yourself but whats the cost benefit? If this game is indeed as imbalanced or ruined by these units then the game wouldnt have lasted this long with more paying customers at the door step. In your case it seems like this imbalance  has brought you a certain level of unhappiness. Maybe another game will bring you that joy. ,summonerswar,d97163x,1,t5_324pd

Or dark darion..can never remember his name.A time or two Ive forgot a dark tank and its a little sketchier.A reviver in this situation does help a lot Ive usually taken one in the past but Dias built like a brick shithouse for raid and has his passive makes it easy. The preceding floors and zaiross arent hard to deal with though so you can take more healing or atb boost and simply outrun them.  Verde Bernard raviti Bella not bad for heal and atb kona can heal and resurge your main healer.

9556479,0,t1_d9qxkgu,yeah but i dont see anything wrong to him being another Julie and i think they could tweak him to still be better than Julie.gt I use double spd Lushens for  of my AO and if you take away their ignore defense theres no amount of improved scaling that would make me use them instead of any other wind aoe nuker.thats why Lushen is overpowered. he simply eliminates all choices for you on AO in regards to easysetupAoE nukers and choices for ADs. And i think there would surely be a possibility to rework his rd to keep it strong and viable maybe even for the same double Lushen setup. But im also not sure if you can compare him to Akhamamir because he requires much more setup to deal insignificantly more damage. He needs a buff strip a def break and at least an atk buff to be really viable. All the setup a Lushen doesnt need but still does way more damage ... as an easily accessibleskillable nat.Afaik there are actually quite a few people who use Julie or used her until they got something better like a nat. For me its just not understandable how a nat can be so much better than  of nats in the same purpose wipe a whole AD by himself with super low setup needed. I find it also a bit ridiculous that every time when you try to build an AD the very first question you have to ask yourself is how easily Is this lushenable? and this question can be answered with yes for like  of the possible ADs.,summonerswar,d9r16hu,1,t5_324pd

Add onto this his  s multiplier on a  and a half cooldown plus the complete bullshit that turn granting skills add onto violent procs and you have the most bullshit monster ever that will be invincible more often than not.

9563572,0,t3_5bvud7,What does Vanessa bring to a fight? S. Nothing Special. It can activate S on a killer but lets be honest. She doesnt hit hard enough to be doing much killing other than cleaning up a other mons mess. S. armor break with similar multipliers to S that does some extra damage based on enemy HP. It doesnt hit hard enough to nuke anyone and single target Def break with a pretty long cool down is laughable. S. Crappy revive. Most monsters are killed before they get a turn. Why? Because your low hp Mons are usually killed first. Having a low hp monster with  hp that has to go through an entire enemy rotation before his regen can take effect means he gets blasted again. Her revive basically creates a meatshield to tank a single hit from theo.  speed increase. Yes its nice.

9620548,0,t1_d9yv0oe,If you can get the SDs its a lot easier but I dont think its worth farming the elemental hall or adding people unless you need the awakening mats as well. It does give an extra option for skillups if youre just patient and diligent enough to check the open SDs a couple days a week though so yeah mantura is easier to skill up.Overall agree that Mantura is the better option. Hes better for ToA because I value AoE slow slightly above AoE Atk down and mantura is built HP meaning he can survive critting Jultan more easily. In GWAO Zinc is only really good to stop chloe but with his pathetic base speed you need an attack bar buffer for him to do his job generally so IMO hes not that great there either.,summonerswar,d9yxibr,1,t5_324pd

There were enough discussions over the last days that stated you can easily program a bot that farms for you.           If the mirroring program is only capable of mirroring no ToS violation but if you are able to send commands to your device from your computer it enables botting  automated access. You dont have to mess with the game files to do that.

9712387,0,t1_daa905u,I didnt know that stuff about the drop rates. I started playing right when the Homunculus update came out. Everywhere I read said to farm Floor  for Magic Mids I will try Floor  next time I need to grind them.    I should have been more specific in my original post but I was thinking the new dungeon with the same runes would have similar entry requirements as Giants. Maybe a little easier or harder but not harder than Dragons. That way it doesnt need a completely original team comp to clear monsters that are used for Giants and Dragons can clear it. I understand why veteran players would want new runes with a new dungeon. Would it be too farfetched to have both? Add an easier dungeon and rearrange current rune drops among them and add another new dungeon with new runes?,summonerswar,daa9exe,1,t5_324pd

I feel like people are miss understanding what comus did when balancing this monster.I have seen comments saying it makes will runes useless or that comus doesnt like immunity. To this I say the opposite. Comus most likely looked at this skill and said hey the theme of this guy says he sets up a redo of the fight. How do we do this?Things to preventUser to use immunity or res to ignore the downside to their team like people use will one fire frankensteinWe also dont want to strip the enemy team nor allow them to not be effected either as then this skill has no use.So really to me it seems fair? Would you want this skill to instead simply say Strip buffs from enemy team and resets all monsters atk bar? Then will runes are definately out as the immunity is completely gone.This skill is requiring you to bring some one to still deal with the immunity. It isnt gone. Basically this skill simply says I Start match with speed buff unless you can nuke me out firstOR I guess strip and reset allowing the user to still ignore the negative effects with immunity if you are that qorrid about power creepBut in my mind they worked to balance this skill. Ignore immunity or ignore buffs have been in place for a while look at fire samurai I also think water desert queen did it before her rework.,summonerswar,dadsypn,1,t5_324pd

Zeratu is really good but Sig will help you way more in dungeons and youre not ready for using Zeratu in a PvP setting yet probably.Running Sig L Vero Bella Shannon Bernard should get you    minute GB runs. Upgrade your Sigs slot  to get his CR and ATK up and at  star max he has good enough stats for GB.If you are able to get your Bella to  Swift or  Vio you can probably get away with a team like Sig L Vero Bella Shannon Theomars and go even faster. I would estimate this as doing about  minute runs. As an aside your Theo is super slow on Vio too his first scales off of speed so if you can I would swap his slot  from ATK to SPD.In DB running Sig over Baretta should get you faster runs I never recommend Baretta for starter DB.

9831516,0,t3_5g33q5,If you build him for ToA Hard he should do crazy good work in your DB team. BDD is the ToA build IIRC and the reason it works so well in DB is because having triple AoE helps a ton for clearing wave  much faster and at the boss wave his damage is still pretty good but he also has aoe atk bar reduction in his nd which helps keep immunity off the dragon even longer. This build will also make him insanely strong for ToA Hard and HoH if you care about that. You could probably get him to do a lot more damage to the boss in DB with a different build but a lot of the clear speed comes from wave  and someone like Theo isnt great for clearing those waves.

9886554,0,t1_daw7lln,I was not saying that she is OP btw. I was just saying that you sounding so sarcastic when your only argument got countered was really stupid. The second argument youve thrown in is kill her turn  if she doesnt die she is tanky and therefore doesnt deal damage.I havent noticed that we are talking about a scanario in which a Camilla is alone and has to kill Tesa on her own. Would be a shame if somebody brought a healer and a dd with him. A real shame. But yeah a Tankmilla probably cant kill a Tesa alone. Good point.And dont say dont focus the tankmilla then. There is no way of finding out wether its a Tankmilla or not without wasting your turn  on her. ,summonerswar,daw8otp,1,t5_324pd

I recently got to GB and now Im able to farm more  runes consistently. However I also made the decision to spend  weeks where  of my mana and energy goes towards working on fusing Veromos. But now that I can do GB I feel like it would benefit me instead to get better runes so I can do Secret Dungeons I have most of the mons though get them maxed  faster and do Hall of Elements faster. Currently I can do B on all elements but was suggested to do B.

Buying premium packs is simply not efficient no matter how you look at it. The only reason to do it is either for fun or because not enough time to refill doing it to progress is simply retarded there is no other way to say it.Actually you wont get nearly as many MS especially since you wont get the full energy per refill and arent doing b yet.,summonerswar,dbbgiqk,1,t5_324pd

In theory RTA can be the thing that saves the game because it offers the most strategic playstyle but when the majority of people are just pure outclassed by all the monsters their opponent has it makes for a negative experience. At least now more people can be competitivepotentially,summonerswar,dbhvvkg,5,t5_324pd

So that it could be like  BB  each BB  each BB  each BB  each BB  eachwhich would come out to be exactly pcs. Not too much but not too shabby either.

10128524,0,t3_5kxg0c,To be honest Id rather just have the ability to attack another players arena defense at will.  Doesnt have to be a reward system.  Just a way to have fun and test and try new things without having to cost yourself wings and official arena ranking.  My brother plays and Id love to hit is AD to see how well I do but to do that Id either have to randomly find him in the arena or do live arena and have him set to auto.IMHO.,summonerswar,dbrr3k3,1,t5_324pd
10130001,0,t3_5kxg0c,Problem with RTA is it brings all the other problems this game has to light. Too many people get lucky fp and pp alike compared to others to make it a fair fight. You can plan an attack on a defense and the only real gamble you have is resistance and violent procs. With RTA there is no AI and you have to deal with the same problems above coupled with the randomness a human controlled monster. There is no planning only  nat s and runes vs. Nat s and runes. Lets say you take out runes. Every monster in RTA is base stats or all inflated to the same level. It would be more interesting. Lets say you also take out owned monsters and people can just bring any mon from the library. Then you have planning and skill vs. planning vs. skill. I know this will never happen but look at mmos like WoW. Their pvp system puts players at an almost equal level and relies much more on skill and coordination then gear levels. A lot of other pvp systems have adopted this method. Another huge problem with RTA is you dont have to play it. You can climb to a high rank and just sit there. Imagine what our arena would be like if you could climb to a point and then take yourself out of the listing. You would have late late game players fighting noobs cause there would be no one else to fight then over time no new people would ever play it. Overall I think it should be a funpvp system with no rankings and no rewards just a system that lets people fight against real players. They will NEVER be able to balance this game to a point where real time pvp would ever be taken seriously. You can kind of get the feeling they want their game to be like LoL or WoW with these huge tournaments for money but this game just simply has too many rng in monsters you have runes you have and violent procs to ever get to that level. ,summonerswar,dbry0ka,2,t5_324pd

I did pull a Leo off of summoning stones after Pang Mo and I know he can be good for arena but Im a long ways off of trying to contend in arena. All honesty all my nat s are either AO or AD monsters and it just pisses me off that none of my Nat s have any real PvE viability compared to my nat s and nat s. Id quickly do a double trade in of any two of my nat s for a monster like Chow or Taor or Verad...I mean I can go on and on.

Double Jultan and a Kumae.I dont have good runes so I rely on high speed and a stunlock comp Aria or SpectraWoonhakBaretta core.  Right now I also have Woonhak and Baretta temporarily runed for min CR so Id like to beat this level before todays end if at all.Can someone explain how Jultan works and how much health he has?  Can his passive crit? Does Defense matter? Baretta and Woonhak and others Ive tried  sometimes die instantly from casting an AOE which means more healing wont solve my problem.  Can I reduce this damage with any buffs or debuffs?  Even at  CR I very frequently get killed this way And Woonhak has  base CR and hits all units twice to stun so mitigation seems very necessary if possible.  What kind of comp could do this?  Is it just impossible without good runes to prevent Jultan from instantly killing me?

10294664,0,t3_5nei4u,For me I had to make Neal slow so I gave her nemesis runes so if she gets targeted by Leo she goes first and if any of the ragdolls hit her she goes next.  Second make her as tanky as possible so she can survive first hit without issue.  I also runed her with revenge so when she is getting bombarded she can revenge stun. I didnt use Michelle for this stage but Id build her fast and again tanky as possible violent if possible swift if not.  But this is just to have a failsafe against any possible mistakes.  Ideally once Neal is shielded you should be able to control Leo enough and force the ragdolls into enough turns that they will kill themselves before her shield goes away even if it isnt extended.,summonerswar,dcayfgd,1,t5_324pd

10318844,0,t1_dcdnygh,The Akroma stage is a grind! It never gets easier you just eventually get to the point where you can auto it so you dont have to look at your phone for  mins.  My advice would be Basalt as your dark tank and probably as lead as well Bella Sig Mav and Verdehile or Baretta depending on how youre doing with the initial waves.  Ideally Id actually use Teon or Dark Undine in place of VerdeBaretta for the revive in case things go really poorly but I also play this level VERY cautiously.  If you can get through the initial two waves without Baretta then do that since Verde will add more damage and turn control than Baretta will without DoTsTurbulence on the Akromas.  Once you get to the Akromas Sig is there to lock down Zaiross as well as doing scaling damage to the Akromas.  If Z gets a cd reset off its GG so if need be have Mav throw a taunt to keep big Z from murdering you.  Then it all comes down to timing your healsdef buff from Basalt and Bella to keep Basalt alive while you whittle down the Akromas.  GL!,summonerswar,dcdp3zt,2,t5_324pd

Might be because the lack of monsters but i dont want to believe in that tbh.  My AOShimiL Bernard Lushen Megan. A single Lushen comp cause i got no second lushen. when the AD is too tanky and not speedy i put Bernard as leader instead of Shimi.  My ADVeroL Theo Bernard Chasun. Your average Conq comp lol.  My Bernard is kinda fast for Ches at  without leadtowers and mainly because of that reason i think i might be able to get to C but i dont know if i got the monsters to do so...

Im patient and strategic and have good resource management... I still have an unused XPBooster and wont make the  before I used it because the  will give me another one with a ticking expiration timer. BUT... Ill probably do that tomorrow... I think Ill go with Chasun... because Chasun! I think shes the only mon others envy me for so she has to be  although I dont yet quite know how much shell help me right now and where to use her. Maybe she can keep a few ppl off my back in arena on Sundays. Im not really doing arena but the  crystals start to be tempting... Should I also give my devilmons to Chasun?But after that which will be just a few days later I already have much more fodder than I need just for Chasun Im now seriously considering Kona. Kona would be at least double purpose He might now be my best shot at a Dragons team while Megan is far from skilled  skillups missing. SigVeroBellaSpectraKona would be all  then  and as a farmable team of course fully skilled. Also we sometimes do raids just for fun and hes quite helpful there as well... I really really want to have a Dragons team even if its only DB for now and not  did I say I was patient? I lied!!  current plan is to have something fragile by Februarys FRR probably wont be stable by then so I can inefficiently farm some runes from Dragons and then have a better DB team by Marchs FRR... is that a reasonable plan?

I prefer keeping Shannon over Bernard in the mentality that your teams will ideally clear waves first turn making the atk buff more valuable than turn stealing.Go to teams in order of decreasing safety and increase in speedSigL Vero Bella ShannonBernard TaorLushen  Sig is great as a nd DD for his leaderLushenL Vero Bella ShannonBernard Taor   Once your safely running Lushen lead with a nd DD your can probably start focusing on building Galleon.LushenL Vero Galleon Taor Bernard  Could also run a support like Bella instead of Bernard but generally if your not running all out dmg you might not be getting full value out of Galleon anyway.Db I wouldnt run Vero with Lisa make one as fast as you can and throw in a buffer. Vero is safer but Lisa is faster. You could put in Megan now if shes faster than Bella VerdeL Vero Bella Megan Taor is a pretty standard team. Otherwise wait until your Galleon is fully built and run something like VerdeL Lisa Galleon BellaMegan Taor. Or Ideally VerdeL Lisa Galleon Hwa  damage however if you cant kill the Dragon before immunity goes up Lisa could struggle to strip without back up like a DD with buff removal.Db with Galleon is a bigger jump than Giants youll more or less farm without Galleon for a while until you can run a speed team that relies on everything dying before it can kill you.

10442907,0,t3_5pjfpv,Theres no way in hell Tyron should be higher than gildong. Both of their primary usage is in TOA and Gildong is the undisputably the better stunner and has a better overall TOA kit since he also brings atk break and armorbreak. Wind and Water Anubis both do not belong in bottom tier. Neither does Barque. Hes arguably better than Hwa in speed giants because he fills the same roll of ATB control on the boss but does more damage and is another source of armorbreak for both the boss and the mini golem. Agree with a lot of the other suggested changes in this thread. Most notably Aquila and Olivia they should be significantly higher. Aquila is the best nat stripper. Syntac has held rank  in RTA multiple times and Olivia is one of his goto monsters.,summonerswar,dcrs8st,1,t5_324pd

10457046,0,t3_5pn2k0,This is a silly HomunculusMonster Collection Question for someone who awakened their fire homunculus immediately and then switched him to water or wind afterwards so I apologize in advance.  So I recently made my homunculus and got him to  unawakened.  Im pretty weirdobsessiveocd about the monster collection perhaps more so than others so I couldnt seem to find an answer to this after a few searches.  Right now he is still unawakened because I want to figure out if I need to switch his element twice first in order to light up the unawakened boxes in the collection or if they will light up after he is awakened.  Yeah I know.  Im that person.  Example to help illustrate my question  I have unawakened fire homu now.  So naturally the unawakened fire homu is the only box lit up currently in the monster collection.  Switch to water unawakened water picture also lights up nothing else.  Makes senseall clear.  Example  Have unawakened fire homu now.  Awaken him and awakened fire homu picture also lights up.  Switch to water.  Awakened water homu picture lights up  will the unawakened water one light up too or do I really need to cycle him through all  primary elements first?  The only reason I think it might be lit up is that I summoned an awakened Soha awhile back and it had never lit up the unawakened water fox but in a recent patch I noticed it did light up despite somehow still never summoning the unawakened form so Im hopeful...thanks!!,summonerswar,dcteswy,1,t5_324pd

Cheers uyoudontchibaiEDIT Another HUGE thing why I love YDCB is because whenever he wants to showcase a unit he goes ALL OUT and BITES THE BULLET. He  stars the monster awakens it feeds it devilmons and also strips runes just for that  showcase that could either go really well or really poorly. Not to bash on other YTers but most of their Monster Showcases are halfassed...  star mediocre runes no devilmon etc. Just shows how much YDCB cares about showing quality content to his viewers. ,summonerswar,dcuy8xo,108,t5_324pd

10472022,0,t3_5pze24,I currently play a lot. Im a Global player aswell Its one of few games I play. Ive been looking for a secondary gameanother way to get into swar since crystals are finite.I love to theorycraftteambuild and you have some mons Id LOVE to play around with.Im pretty experienced and can definitely lovecare for another account seeing as I have a lot of free time due to some circumstances. This account would be PERFECT to occupy my time seeing I dont like to JUST farm on my main account all day since I havent wanted to buy crystals much for itits set. My current account however cant reach the true top echelon of arena and Id love an account for that kinda thing. My PVP is a bit lackluster and I dont have certain nat s Id LOVE for PVP especially.I dont wanna leave a sob reason or whatever but I assume youll want a reason for me saying Summoners war is one of few games I play so the reason I play summoners war mainly is because I have a a couple of hand conditions which make it extremely painful to play PC games due to the position of wristshands on a keyboard but mobile games are perfect due to the setup I have for them and touchscreen being much less strenuous.Also Ive always wanted a Squallmera just throwing that out there.Good luck to all in the giveaway!!Edit For me the biggest appeal of an endgame account like yours is not having to worry too much about certain aspects of the game that I might otherwise have to. On my main account for example I still occasionally feel pressure to get some summons etc. because of need for fodder and such. Another HUGE issue is that sometime instead of being able to  a fun mon or a mon I want to  i need to  something less fun out of necessity or for progression. On an account like yours Id imagine that there is nothing left progressionwise so I could  fun mons that dont usually see use or crap mons but rune them well for fun and to mess around with my friendsguildiesother players in arena and RTA etc. I think that it would also be FANTASTIC for helping my guild out because Ive been with a small guild for a long long time but we have issues where we cant deal with certain defenses and a lot of them arent up to par with the rank we want to achieve. Im sure theyd appreciate another helping hand to take out players we normally couldnt.Edit  Also if youd like proof of the whole cant play nonmobile games situation  my ability to commit a lot of time to SWAR feel free to PM me I dont want to post details about publicly.

10496130,0,t1_dcxu71m,So assuming that the majority of paying players are casual playing then the amount of money they spend is typically on monster summoning and not refills because they have the same amount of refills as a normal nonpaying player then the advantage seems fairly insignificant when considering luck .YDCB and other streamers and the G top players are all a diff story though these guys make money off the game and they have to stay at the top so I think its perfectly reasonable for them to be spending amounts that DO give them significant advantages. I dont think they represent the casual paying player that most people tend to fall under. But at the same time I think thats where all the hate comes from when nonpaying players see YDCB or knightly or something spend tons of money and get ahead. Well considering that they are spending k  I mean it they are a different breed of players.,summonerswar,dcxuhtm,2,t5_324pd

That comes out in the inconstancy of how he expresses or dismisses things and how he thinks the new sold items can be good. He pays for it all spends  time farming and can still make himself  star runes. That effect is also multiplied when he buys an endgame account so skips all the main farming anyway.  ,summonerswar,dcy577j,2,t5_324pd

So I compared him to other Nat s of Water element which he is right? So tell me why he isnt underpowered and why you would personally choose him over other Nat s in Water? Also hmm if you read the post where someone told me to think about Akroma stage in toaH I instantly remembered  Ragdoll in which case I gladly agree he is very useful there and is viable. I thanked him for opening my eyes since I forgot about such a big thing. Tbh it did shine Chandra a little bit of light given my dire thoughts of him being used as a weak GwO choice only. Im not biased and Im open to new ideas  ways to use him which was the point of this post. What you gave me in your original post was actually what I already stated I knew in my topic.

10526905,0,t1_dd1a6yw,What do you mean by rather reliably? I cant see your runes but Bella should be a part of that team. You need to relax you wont be doing DB for a while. Either run Vero L Bella Shannon Bernard with Chasun  or Lushen if you are getting  success rate. If not it means you need better runes on everyone else.Personally I would continue to work on GB until you are hitting about  at which point you should start to see the rune quality that will let you clear TOA and consider transitioning into DB. Build and  star Baretta and Spectra and also get a  star mav if you can. This should allow you to clear TOA normal pretty easily.From there you almost have the standard starter DB face team. I would fuse Sig at some point unless you pull another good water DD. Sig can slot in to your GB team with Lushen Sig Bernard Shannon and Veromos. Your starter DB face team will then be Sig L Megan Bella Veromos Spectra but keep in mind you need plenty of decent swift sets for this to work.Zaiross doesnt really help you anywhere PVE at the moment you can definitely still build him if you want because its zaiross! ,summonerswar,dd1c83g,2,t5_324pd

10534208,0,t1_dd24ux6,DD DD Vero Bella ShannonBernardMegan is a pretty common team when speeding things up. I do recommend keeping Shannon she just has more utility than Bernard does. You can test these teams out yourself to see what works best. In my experience for clear times Megan gt Shannon gt Bernard but stability wise Shannon gt Bernard gt Megan.For DB that team is good but use Verde leaderskill speed is much more needed than HP in DB. Sig k HP is safe but you can go lower mine has k HP k Atk  CR  preferred High CD  spd not as necessary if you have verde multiple sets used most common early game is fatalbladeMegan k HP  Acc speed higher than Bella after speed tower  Verde lead. Swift set. Skill ups highly preferred but works without. For Chiwu you can always try and nuke the boss true for basically every boss stage though. Usually if you cant keep the adds stunned and they are causing problems then youll have to kill them first.

If that poses you a problem kill one or both pernas before moving onto vero.  An AOE slower that wont glance is key if you are having problems here.  Mantura Aria Spectra Poseidon come to mind.  Shannon will have trouble slowing the Pernas because of elemental disadvantage.  Barretta is important as well for resetting Veros attack bar.

10803667,0,t1_ddu0lkl,The main reason to make him violent over others is what people bring against him.If the comps that beat your team are buff block teams that nullify khmuns shield it doesnt help as muchIf your khmun comp has nolimited heals and the majority of people are tanking khmun dmg with Chasun and using her falling blossoms to heal through the healblock and amuse to sustain their team whilst they juggle the shield down between your other mons and khmun is heal up with his nd the whole time eventually they get left with just khmun shielding only himself every turn.

The person I replied to even said this.Veromos is just an example.So how exactly does Vero utilize Vio runes better than Khmun ? And the person was speaking about efficiency gt when a monster offers ABCD and violent doesnt help D that doesnt make violent pointless... Its just make it less efficient.you were speaking about utilize them as good as other units. While the person named only ability D as being less efficient you were generalizing that it would make all abilities less efficient.Lets take a look for a closer comparisonx | Veromos | Khmun | conclusion|||skill | spd scaling  dot | spd scaling  heal block | both scale with spd but Khmun brings his own  spd lead so he can utilize spd stats betterskill dmg | Spd  .  | Spd  . x   | Damage at  spd Vero  Khmun  x  . Counting Khmuns  spd lead it would be skill | AoE stun with dmg based on atkown max HP cooldown  turns | single target nuke  heal with dmg based on own max HP and target HP ratio cooldown  turns | while an AoE stun is useful it doesnt do much damage even with his HP lead and  turns cooldown is not much but can decide the result of a match. Khmuns  turn cooldown huge nukeheal can literally abuse Violent to almost spam it and constantly damage enemy  heal himself.skill dmg |  atk   max HP |  of max HP | No matter how much ATKHP your Vero has he will never do as much damage as  of Khmuns max HP would do. passive | removes  debuff from each member  heals self a tiny bit | reapplies shield to lowest HP ratio target | this is probably the biggest plus for Vero since he could remove a few debuffs at once with Vio procs but usually there arent more than  debuffs anywaygt You arent actually addressing my point that putting violent runes on a unit that clearly doesnt need it is a waste.not sure if you have read my post but IMO i do because Khmun can use them just as equally. Sure he doesnt necessarily need them but he can become insane on Vio runes. Would you say that Vio runes on Vero are mandatory? If so guess how many have their Vero runed with Swift or NemWill ? So same can be applied to Vero. He can use Vio runes but he doesnt necessarily need them either. So using the same runes for both Khmun will obviously do more damage and be faster. Passive can be mostly neglected since it more or less equals out between Vero cleansing def break and the enemy does normal damage and Khmuns k shield soaking up damage. If you dont believe go watch some videos of Childish using his Khmun in GW.edit typos,summonerswar,ddv7o43,0,t5_324pd

Ive been doing R for a very long time with friends and weve tested the damage on Fei and Xiao Lin in raids.  Its not even close.No offense but just looking at your post history youre still asking people how to properly rune for raids.  Youre obviously new to the game so dont talk about things you dont know anything about.S  Theres only a  difference in damage between the two.  The big difference is that Xiao Lins has  ATB reduction and slows which is HUGE for raiding obviously you wouldnt know you dont even have a raid team yet.  Feis S besides having  more damage is useless.S  Xiao Lins S increases damage for every debuff the boss has.   times Xiao Lins S will do more damage than Fei by a lot.  My Xiao Lin can hit k with S on raid boss trust me when I say Fei wont be able to do that only once in a blue moon  or  chance if she can ignore defense  or  times.  Xiao Lins S is much easier to set up to do mass damage as the boss will always have massive amounts of debuff on him.tldr  Xiao Lin brings more damage and brings more utility with ATB reduction  Slow.  Seriously look at every other post in this thread.  Everybody is saying Xiao Lin however for no reason you think Fei even though youve never raided with either.gt More over you can use her in AD and AO with her speed lead.

Water DPS at  CR Fire DPS at  CR similar ratios in ATK and CDMG. . Im going to prepare my reruning well ahead of time this month with a speed DB team being a priority setting up bernardmeganx lushen then maintaining consistency in GBToARaids.

10919812,0,t3_5vzp06,Good video and nice to see something more prepared and in depth than other youtubers who just jump on the news and read it out. The collaborative discussion element is great! I had not subscribed to you in the past but definitely will do so.Im very hopeful for jackolanterns. I dont know if you had missed it and have not tested it but their S attack animations were made significantly faster. I farmed a lot of the fire one from HoH and have been looking for an excuse to build him and one of my early LD lightnings Light Jack Misty!Jacks already have a S  attack multiplier and a S  multiplier. I cant think of any scenarios in the past where they stated both attack power and attack speed and most speed based damage dealing units simply determine a multiplier based on their speed that is then multiplied by their attack to determine damage. I expect they will completely modify the multiplier to be similar to all other speed based damage dealers. Ill be shocked if they have a base attack  multiplier with an additional  multiplier based on speed.Ultimately I expect that the jack o lanterns will have a damage output similar to Rakshasa with the fire and light being greater having two speed based attacks. Its always nice to see speed being implemented into the calculation as it allows for a more useful spd cd atk build that both increases damage while allowing for more turns. I love that we are seeing more things like this lately in monster balances. Attack is nice and all but its such a static stat and its very hard early game to build units that have high damage output but do not get significantly outpaced. I want to see more damage dealers with builds that are not simply ATTCDATT,summonerswar,de6avm3,2,t5_324pd

You need to build a farming monster this can be your magic knight so awakening it helps for the lead boost.  Your goal should be to get a single monster that can solo a scenario level Tamor  or faimon  are good starting points.  Beat it on normal.  If you cant solo one of those on normal you have to go lower or get better runes.  Your runes should be  or  star on your farming monster.  Once you can have a monster solo start bringing fodder this will be  star monsters that you get to max level then evolve to star and use those to level  star monsters or for more fodder for stronger monsters.

Also SPD tuning is very important with this team  Spectra gt Megan gt Vero gt Bella gt Sigma is best.Your runes   Sigmarus lack HP. Vero is fine.  Bella needs to be a bit tankier. Megan needs to be faster and tankier. Spectra needs to be faster and tankier. My stats on my smurf account for reference you can probably get away with a bit less but not that much since your SPD totem is so low level. ,summonerswar,deivagz,1,t5_324pd

Like Sian is really good for skillups.  But Jojo is fusable.  Thats a huge help but not game breaking.  Also only lushen needs skillups. Liebli but hes both rare and still nat  Now skydancer are all good. Both lnd being   Chasun and mihyang both needs skillups.  And really benefit from those. But also the monster itself is niche but still really good. Maybe that of a ran tier Giving all these together hwahee is still too good.

11079822,0,t3_5y804u,Knowing which runes to keep and sell is the key to dong well in this game. Efficiency is important but its not the be all end all. Synergy is much more importantWhen you see a rune ask yourself if this rune rolls exaxtly the way I want it to can it be an upgrade for me?. If the answer is yes you should at least roll it. You also have to look at a rune as what it will become after you grind all the stats and enchant one off. Even if a swift or violent rune has a flat stat if the other stat is speed and a  i will roll it.  spd ungrinded is resectable. And I doubt many if you have many swift or violent runes with  sod ungrinded. Even if the other stat is flat. It could still become an amazing rune if  and  roll right. Then you can enchant off the flat stat. Depending in where u are in the game you might not want to roll runes like these but most likely they could be an upgrade for you. For slot    you should have higher standards. Because these type of runes are more common,summonerswar,denvyzu,3,t5_324pd

But looking to that Megans HP and Speed I cant stop to think that you will have to spend some months in G to get some good substats for your base team before to go for a  safe D.Farming G first will help in TOA too. No matter if its about min since its safe. There is a post that tells you the minimum stats of each monsters for G D and TOA.So I recommend you to  that Verde and try to hit G and D for months. Maybe you can get some Lushen or Amir to reduce your G time worked for me when I got Lushen.You can try Vero Basalt Briand Megan and the Panda for TOA. But dont worry if you dont get this month I couldnt do it  on the first month too. The rate of getting a nat on a Legendary is lower than on MS my experience. Maybe  Bareta could help on entire TOA.  Monsters is too hard to stand TOA.Hope to help you.,summonerswar,dfj799a,2,t5_324pd

I was a little sad though understanding sank in and it was for the better of all and he is still OP.I agree with you.  I posted this as my end of day steam release after reading countless posts about people complaining about RTA. I have said it many times... RTA is NOT Arena. You cannot skip people so you are literally fighting people you would have naturally skipped in arena.  Once in the cage you fight or leave possibly giving them the win... the win they probably would have had in Arena if you actually fought them.People do not like to lose neither do I. The difference is that I work to win not complain about losing.  I am barely fighter rank because I have been playing around with comps to see who will help me most and many of those picks are not what I use in Arena.The gold stars next to my name in Arena are a false representation of how I fare in RTA and that is because RTA is completely different.  I understand that. I am working on bettering myself to actually compete.You are correct. There are many people that forget about every win they have had because of vio procs.  I would urge people to keep a running tally and see how often they win vs. lose by their own vio procs... they would be surprised. ,summonerswar,dfk1g5m,2,t5_324pd

11405204,0,t1_dfoqthv,Hello there !Im exactly at the same point on the game.What Im doing is the following things   Getting importants monster for TOADB to  stars. Ive done Spectra and Megan the next ones are Baretta and Mav or the last monster Ill need to DB If I drop it but I dont have it yet  I only have Vigor now and dont really want to get him  stars.  speeding my GB by improving runes on specific monsters. Im mainly improving VeromosBella to DB stats requirements which are K HP  SPD and  ACC and Akhamamir because its my wind nuker for GB and Aiden Hard farmer. Im thinking on replacing Shannon by Megan if my GB is safe enough so shell speed it up and its worth it because Ill use Megan for DB too.My main goals are  Reaching TOA this month. Im stuck at TOA  and TOAH  too at the moment hopefully itll be OK after next FRR. Speeding my GB to less than  minutes Im at  right now or even more this month. Preparing DB for next month  Im sure I will not be able to do it after next FRR so my main goal is to reach it after the one in May.As for your questions  For Mav even broken set is fine if you can reach the stats you want with that. I dont think youll be able to run Sigmarus Vero Bella Spectra Megan for first DB without violent runes. Vigor is a safer option for example but sadly he is not really usefull in other parts of the game  You can definitly use crystal to refill energy when you are on  hours boost XP too.

I know from what I saw that Verde Galleon Tarq  usually a hwa or somethin of the sort or another Tarq is used in speed teams. I am really sorry that I cannot tell you more but I think that this will give you enough things to do for the next month or so getting those two to  getting their runes set up maybe. After you have those  set up maybe ask again and see what people tell you to pair them with. You can search for what runes are best for them. Also try not to get Verde to skill up his S if possible.,summonerswar,dfwndrl,1,t5_324pd
11477624,0,t3_63rxda,ATK buff influences both of Theos skill the same so we can ignore that. The multiplier of S is equal to the one of S at  SPD. This SPD is the total SPD Theo needs meaning leaderskills glory buildings and SPD buff already taken into account for S to hit equally hard as his S assuming equal circumstances.Basically S will always deal more damage than S under the same debuff conditions unless you run a slow Theo which nobody should do anyway.Now what happens if we factor in the DEF break from S and assume a nondef broken target for S?In this example we use Verde from your video which is a low DEF monster. He has a low base DEF  and is usually build for SPD ACC and HP. Well assume  DEF here since he probably has buildings maxed and some DEF subs somewhere. Its also a nice number to use We can divide this into  scenarios. Theo hits DEF break on first hit of S or on the second hit or not at all.Number of hits after DEF break on S|total SPD needed for S to be equal|raw SPD needed|||||||||||||Now the left column tells us how many hits S gets on a DEF broken target. Middle SPD is where S gets equal damage below that S is always better and the right column is just the same as the middle one but without SPD totem and Galleons leaderskill. I dont want to hear any comments on the .TLDR Using S on Verde was the right decision assuming at least one DEF break.Edit Typo,summonerswar,dfwzglx,2,t5_324pd

You have to  them both anyway so anyone you choose isnt wrong.From personal experience  i would suggest you  bella . I did the opposite which is to  vero  he wasnt really any stronger than his  counterpart  he was just tankier  bella on the otherhand is a complete beast when . The perks of  Vero though is youll have a faster tamor hell farmer  bella can solo tamor hell for sure but hes slow af   Yes craft vio runes mainly because you cant farm them yet  craft  ones only never do the lower ones  but dont switch them out for your swift runes unless they have god tier stats ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT A DECENT SWIFT SET IS gtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgtgt TRASH VIO SET. For runes My advice would be do giants b or  if you can do that  this should be easy with the standard Vero Bella Shannon Bernard Darion lineup  people will tell you its not efficient and you should not do it  dont listen to them any rune you get from b is gonna be useful  especially purple and blue    slot  runes are useful too if they have good substats  early game players cant be choosers  you take what you get and those giants runes are gonna be helpful in making your first gb team. if you cant do giants bb  do scenario maps the boss drops  blue runes and the best drops from the normal stages are  green runes . These runes are awesome for completing sets or just getting some runes so you can do giants.gtWhich tips can you give me for my further progress?  vero   bella  FUSE SIGMARUS  After  vero and bella FUSE SIGMARUS ASAP  hes an amazing monster that will help you up to db   have alot of patience and pray to rnjesus that you get a verdehile after and everything will be ezpz.,summonerswar,dfzpw6f,1,t5_324pd

11574510,0,t1_dg7ms0j,Lapis is quite versatil with the runes set you use for faimon . Fatal or Rage  Blade An example of Fatalblade can be found here Id recommend having better speed tho that speed seems to low too me. With this build Lapis will either farm under s or fail this probably has the potential to be the fastest as the other build rely on stuns and life steal. I guess Ragerevenge is an option but seems a bit of an overkill.. Despairrevenge prebuff this was the go to build and still works obviously. Vampirerevenge Ive seen a few ppl mentioning pre and post buff but is definitely a less common route mostly because vamp runes are harder to getAs for the main stats. Slot  ATK or SPD SPD if you couldnt get enough speed from substats. Recommended speed is  to match the big hound but if you go down the route of vampire you may be able to get away with less and a tankierish build. Slot  CR CD or ATK... CRCD if youre going for crit damage obviously if not then just ATK. Slot  ATK theres nothing else better here,summonerswar,dg7z6ak,1,t5_324pd

Do that for the magic essence. Now repeat for the windwaterfire essence.Now repeat ALL of that three more times for the other  mons you need to awaken for the fuse.If you want to farm all the essence in halls getting zero xp from it and afterwards go spend the energy to level the fodder in scenarios be my guest.

The AoE attack bar reset is actually worse than Shannons S for trash waves... Slow and stun is a lot more effective for killing off the wave with minimal damage. The CD reset is really bad actually... The boss is the only one affected by it and even then hes not shut down in the slightest given his first and counter attack deal most of his damage.

Anti crit useless against bombs or molongs rd dark slyphid too. His  atb boost only applies to  ally. And its not that effective if u dont even get to move while being frozen or stunned or slept. He really needs to be paired up with an immunity buffer. But during ban pick phase pick one immunity buffer? gt gets banned. Pick  immunity buffers? gt ur opponent lets both through and bans ur DD leaving you with light horus n  immunity buffers. They take down your only dd threat and u have basically just lost.

11621926,0,t3_65usku,Yeah Racuni is pretty good against HathorVeradOkeanos CC comps and in general a really good RTA unit. Most of the time people will keep focusing one unit in your team and Racuni will keep removing those def breaks and healing back up. Even if you still get  cced her passive healing is usually just enough to sustain against full support cc comps.She will keep cleansing the ally with the lowest HP. Sometimes she will cleanse someone and heal him back up so he isnt the lowest anymore get another turn and cleanse someone else.Definitely not a hard counter by any means. If the opponent knows what hes doing he can still reduce her cleansing effectiveness. Still really tricky to play against and definitely requires some skill to counter.You can either build her super fast to get as many turns as possible or build her slower than  everyone else in your team to get full advantage of her atb refill. Kinda like how Verde works. She needs to be really tanky too. If the opponent let her through the ban phase she usually gets targeted first.,summonerswar,dgdcu3a,12,t5_324pd

11648685,0,t3_6629w6,password restrictions kill me... Most of my passwords are secure AF but I once used a password for something that was never going to be guessed no matter the brute force     space bar  times and super easy to remember... Who has just spaces or even really multiple spaces in their brute force? As many people in this thread have said long passwords are better but simple things can help a lot as well eg  Doubble or tripple spacing between words or even in the middle of words misspeltingb wordu. Even like if you have password rather than being secure and using PasWrd you can use simple phrases and have your own encryption thats abnormal like swapping any common letter to an uncommon letter like a to u and r to a rather than an o to a zero . so PusWad  is good as a brute force uses dictionary words and  knows the common replacements. ,summonerswar,dgge52o,1,t5_324pd

11650123,0,t1_dggjklq,You can also think of it like this. Youll likely have most Nat s if you keep playing but only a few LD Nat s if any. And to be honest a lot of Nat s are pretty rubbish.Dias is great for Raids. Yes he could be replaced with Darion but Darion has higher rune requirements and lacks Resistance leader skill. He fulfills a niche that the other four HoH mons cant provide. A lot of people here are grateful because they like you probably skipped out of Dias thinking they wouldnt need him or fed him early on.

11691733,0,t1_dgl905p,Do you have the rest of your team figured out? When youre building a raid team its important to make sure you have a variety of debuffs a dedicated cleanser and sometimes secondary enough healers and enough DDs at least one. Assuming Colleen and KonaLisa are on your team you have  other mons to figure out also need to pick  man FL or  man FL.Looking at the FL you want an heal blocking tank if possible atk break and heal block are the  most important debuffs in raid Dias or Eshir. Dias is better for this role because he has a damage reduction passive and an atkdef break s while Eshir has a strip s nothing to strip obviously and a buff that the boss will eat to heal himself if heal block is not up you want to minimize unnecessary buffs.As for the other mons you listed Ariel is a great heal spammer and a pretty good choice for raid. Downside is that he doesnt have any debuffs Rakan is great for FL since he does amazing damage with his collapse revenge procs near the end of this video you can check him out in action Basalt is bad for raid no debuffs and another buff you dont needWith those mons I would probably go for a  man FL. Something like FL ArielXF Rakan Dias Colleen BL Kona DD or Colleen BL if you cant get enough tank stats on her starting out.

Sig is definitely a better option than Theo for dungeon purposes but I didnt think the effort required to fuse him was worth the slight improvement and Im glad I did skip fusing sig. For the most part I think youll progress faster improving your Beth or Theo or current teams than to spend that time fusing sig. Sig also falls off lateend game whereas Beth and Theo only gets better lateend game. ,summonerswar,dgmdlmj,1,t5_324pd

For example Hwahee  Mihyang or bombers  Seara  Kobold Bombers  Liebli Generally not many unit use ATK on slot  because it doesnt increase the damage compared to a CD or CR runeCR or CDIt is preferred to go CR on slot  to max CR first before considering CD.Imagine this  a unit with no CR and CD on slot  will not be reliable and when it crits  when it crits  sure it may be a lots but most of the time its inconsistent and makes the damage output not that nice.Once you get enough CR  normally Min   from subs you can shift over to CD and you will notice a big spike in damages.So to sum it up a nuker prefers CR gt CD gt ATK when first starting out. Once you have good CR you shift over to CD I have a CD on SIG I will swap that now for the cost see if it makes it a better run....  ,summonerswar,dgq4200,1,t5_324pd

Skill up galleon  amir. Jamire can work as  just probably wont be doing much damage. Personally i dont see jamire as useful in gbGz btw since he isnt primarily a damage dealer unless he is built like spd cd hp or something and even then at  you would want him in most of your guild battles for say like jamire galleon amir or something as a cleave.

11799526,0,t3_688455,Wanted to ask is there a cap for accuracy in dungeons and if so what is it? And also if Belladeons Seize is affected by accuracy I ask this because Ive only realized that my Belladeons runes were SpdHpAcc and I was thinking of swapping out the acc rune for another HP or perhaps a Def. But that would lower my acc from  to roughly . I use the Bella mostly for D btw.Any answers would be welcomed thanks.,summonerswar,dgximdf,1,t5_324pd
11800518,0,t1_dgxjl7l,Since you didnt say Im just going to assume youre doing R. Both are really squishy. For a FL Xiao Lin she has super super low def with a  man FL you want all your FLers to have like  def MINIMUM youre barely scraping at that minimum recommended is more like k def. Both of your mons have low CR yes I know you have a CR lead but on your KFG thats still like  CR...Both of them are far from ideal in that sense. Resistance is also pretty bad yes again theres a res lead but you still want some resistance on them. ,summonerswar,dgxmoa2,2,t5_324pd
11801134,0,t1_dgxos7v,Blah blah blah.  Laika ? Multihitters.  Fire mkWind mk? Kill it.  Light panda? Will runes gg one failure and youre sitting around with a monster wasting space for  turns work and the panda vio procs  time and your success was worthless.    Need to oblivion something specific for arena offense like a tankmilla rina fria or other monster? well congratulations they tend to be runed with high resistance if you dont land your oblivion you are fucked if you do land it and they vio proc  time youre done for.    Khmun  Theo  X comp which isis should be made to counter in gw? Sorry  turns if they proc its over if they resist its over if they proc  times on their first turn since you have to wait for their will runes to go away you die despite having will runes and tanky units.  Better bring that farmable guy Copper.   AoE oblivion amp silence is nice in itself but when the monster brings no sustain no damage no proper anything besides that its a borderline useless monster.    I have her Ive played with her for quite some time Ive used her in high end arena high end guild wars and tried her out in rta. There are simply put a shitton of better options. She is so niche that her use is purely in theory.  ,summonerswar,dgxp6ud,1,t5_324pd

11804137,0,t1_dgy0jx6,Not really necessary since Woosa on AD was to cast rd skill as fast as possible. Vero on nemesis was mainly used for lushen traps. So fast and tanky Vero is needed,summonerswar,dgy1g12,1,t5_324pd

11805268,0,t1_dgxuce9,Even if you are starting out and dont have the runes? I think for example Vero would be a lot more help and Bella is a good healer and easier to rune and skill.,summonerswar,dgy6214,1,t5_324pd
