One of the main issues of concern Ive seen in previews is that Tricos AI can be uncooperative at times and itll go off and do its own thing much like Agro did.  But personally I like that lets you know that this is an independent being an not just a tool for your character to use.Its also what puts Agro as the number one top video game horse for me.,TeamIco,dap0wph,2,t5_2souo

The other  hell look in the direction you wanted walk over there have a good sniff and disregard your command to have a scratch or wander over to a different corner to do some cool little idle thing there.He reminds me so much of my dog theres a slight stubbornness to him. More than anything be patient with him when you issue a command give him some time to think about it. Hell usually do it within  seconds often after hes had a good look sniff or peeked back over his shoulder to look at you.Such an admirable job creating a creature that feels so real.,TeamIco,db3uwkk,4,t5_2souo
