12802,0,t1_cefu27s,I was just thinking this  that he doesnt like to do much just to be left alone. That opens up some dramatic potential  where he has adventures against his will  but realistically makes him a bad lead if they stick to the truth of the character.I like him just as an interesting supporting character in that world. Then again I would read some Mycroft books if they were well recommended.,Holmes,cefw49b,4,t5_2t57s

5786896,0,t1_cxeangx,Actually when she is Adler they are in London. While I agree that it is quite a liberty to make Moriarty Irene Adler it does tie up an important piece of canonMoriarty never beats Holmes but Irene Adler has. Therefore I submit to you that it is an extremely effective conundrum to distill the characters down this way Moriarty being an arc villain who supposedly gets personal with Holmes but we never see and Adler who can beat Holmes but is brief in character.Now as for the second point I submit that yes Watson does act as the Musclethough when you truly think about it does he need it when Sherlock has his imaginary kung fu Bartitsu handy and can take dangerous criminals? Moot point Id argue. However youre also forgettimg that through out Elementarys first season Joan gets combat training and firearm training and hanging out with the police Joan does have ample opportunity to practice even if she doesnt normally carry around a firearm. Side note Id venture to guess you have not seen the beginning of Elementarys third season? I would highly suggest that actually. The introduction of Kitty Winter is quite well done for  episodes and they stay pretty true to character barring the extra material needed to make her a regular. Her regular short story The Illustrious Client gets a double episode makeover to a standard Sherlock length and it actually stays decently close to the important plot beats barring one or two twists for time. I entirely reccomend it and the first half of the season.What I am arguing for Watson however is that to effectively portray a realistic modern Watsom they do have to learn Sherlocks methods. My sticking point with Watson is that they are essentially a mirror flip of Mycroft you see. Watson works very hard but doesnt have the same inventive mind as Sherlock and Mycroft whereas Mycroft is inventive and clever but is much too lazy for detective work. In Elementary this is portrayed very well because Joan does stay up all night looking for a mundane clue like a rice allergy or the pallets on a security feed buckling under weight but misses inventive details like Sherlock knowing how someone would time dropping an Air Conditioner to look like an accident or checking a corpses heart for burns from a pacemaker malfinction.And this is also important because the series portrays Sherlock Holmes in very different ways Sherlock himself being essentially both characters to a degree and neither. If I may be so bold Sherlock in Sherlock has everything come easily to him. Chunks of information come easily and conmect within minutea his only real challenge being if those clues lead to a source or if they just help solve a murder. It makes him superhuman but also limits his abilities to whats infront of him and in some cases makes you wonder how different it would be if Mycroft were there to point out everything but is supposedly lazier? I cant even remember Sherlock even working after sunset once across the series in study.Elementarys Holmes is a different take on the same character. I do not think you would argue he isnt gifted and his ability for observation sharp as a point but he seems more mundane a fellow. Thats fine in my opinion because the directors and actors take the time to show how hard Sherlock works at being a detective. Case files are always everywhere and corkboards are piled up  tvs play conflicting video and all nighters are the norm. This is a regular element of Sherlock Holmes character that Elementary does very well.But in truth I find neither Sherlock is  on the money the true Sherlock being able to make snappy deductions to berate those around him before going back digging in his heels  to the floor with a pipe and working. How many books portrayed him contemplating or bouncing ideas off Watsons mind for the more mundane at the late hours infront of a fire or caught up at a desk his shirtsleeves up reading by the sunlight as Watson awakens? ACD always meant to show that being a detective is hard work especially for someone like Sherlock Holmes and I think a perfect portrayal incorporates both in honest truth.I suppose at the end of the day what I mean to say is that my sticking points are a much looser collective for Sherlock Holmes. Is the dynamic right between Sherlock and Watson? Does Watson contribute? Is there some kind of largerthanlife element that would require the worlds greatest detective over the police?  Does it feel like the story could happen in its time period?Now does Elementary hit all the marks of that all the time? No but they have  episodes a season to do that and hit the mark a fair amount of time. When you originally questioned why anyone would enjoy Joan Watsons character its because even stripped of the pieces of what make John Watson a John Watsons dynamic with Sherlock in Elememtary is at its heart right while at the same time developing in the way modern writing dictates is believable. Watson is believably Sherlock Holmes best friend and the only person that he could not live withoutPlatonically and the writers go out of their way to make that dynamic as true between the characters as possible.I am quite enjoying this conversation as well. Again I highly reccomend the third season first half of Elementary. Very excited for Sherlocks christmas specialhoping it washes the taste of the adventure of the empty hearse out of my mouth finally,Holmes,cxef40m,2,t5_2t57s
