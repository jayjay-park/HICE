6228847,0,t1_cyxnakk,Lol I dont run the polls. Goes to show how much you know about the party. people? Lol. Thats barely a drop in the bucket in the size of our party and were better of without most of them.The irrelevant graph shows the share of the vote over time. I cant wait when you regret calling us the party of handouts when youre unemployed and asking for one. Youll probably be unemployed or probably are because of your toxicity and how much of a miserable person you are.,MCNN,cyxnhwh,1,t5_3ah8e

6938272,0,t3_4aqzji,gt the staff member who created this comic will not be fired as I was complicit in its posting.Youre implying that the staff member would have been fired had you not been complicit meaning you find the offense to be deserving of such a punishment as it was. Isnt this a reason to step down yourself as well as firing the staff member since you seem to consider it an appropriate consequence?,MCNN,d12s4xt,10,t5_3ah8e
