450049,0,t1_cfresl1,That would be fine too. Though you still have the issue of a small number of subreddits having a disproportionate amount of subs and all the moderation problems that come along with that due to them being default for so long. Maybe they could wipe all current subscriptions out and have a refresh day at the same time they remove defaults. Then just populate the frontpage for nonmembers with top posts of rall but filter anything nsfw. I have a suspicion that even without default status all subs would eventually trend towards what we have now though. Users would just join the popular and active subs eventually smaller competing subs would die out and be consumed by the bigger ones.,ideasfortheadmins,cfrf2xd,2,t5_2qqhi

688187,0,t1_cgihlk9,Yeah I agree. CSS should be used to help users welcome them impart information and above all else IMO not hinder the use of the site. Im more likely to not dig into a community that greets me first by telling me Im unwanted its pretty cliquish and unwelcoming.Also I have no problem telling new users how to get around CSS tricks like that in the help subreddits. I tell them they can subscribe sure but I also make sure they realize that means the subreddit will show up on their front page which isnt always welcome. I also tell them a few different ways to turn off CSS in case they prefer visiting directly or through multis. Theres a couple the silently hide reply buttonscomment boxes to nonsubscribers too which is super confusing to new users. I really do think those subreddits are shooting themselves in the foot. If they are trying to keep people not invested in the community from participating then forcing them to subscribe seems backwards to me. If theyre lazy and dont unsubscribe then suddenly they will have posts on their frontpage they dont want to see and will downvote just to get rid of them or troll comment whenever thy pop up.,ideasfortheadmins,cgihybi,4,t5_2qqhi
814740,0,t3_23gyg9,So.. I get where youre coming from with this but most mod teams really arent that dysfunctional and whomever is at the top of the list is generally the creator. In most cases the creator deserves to be at the top of the list and have full control as they were often the ones who spent a lot of time in the beginning building their communities. Its a lot of work to get a subreddit off the ground through organic growth.Besides.. I highly doubt this would reduce squabbling where it already is. It would likely create more squabbling with fear of mod coups and dysfunctional mod teams would be even less likely to add newuntested mods for fear they would be removed when they were randomly moved down the list.,ideasfortheadmins,cgww17y,3,t5_2qqhi
