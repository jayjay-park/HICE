1665508,0,t1_cjookhj,What the fuck did you just fucking say about Steph Curry you little bitch? Ill have you know he graduated top of his class at Davidson and has been involved in numerous secret raids on your defense and has over  confirmed three pointers made. he is trained in point guard warfare and he is the top shooter in the entire NBA. You are nothing to him but just another bucket. He will wipe you the fuck out with handles the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth mark his fucking words. You think you can get away with dunking on him over the rim? Think again fucker. As we speak he is contacting his secret network of Andre Iguodalas across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead kid. He can be anywhere anytime and he can shoot the ball in over seven hundred ways and thats just with his bare hands. Not only is he extensively trained in three point shooting but he has access to the entire arsenal of Golden State Warriors and he will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the basketball court you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot. He will shit buckets all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking swished kiddo.,nbacirclejerk,cjp3kmg,5,t5_2td2i

4969499,0,t3_3iynrn,Very long so bear with me.So theres this girl at my church. And I told her in early May that I liked her realized that I liked her in early February and she said she liked me back but didnt want to do anything until basically school was over. So my goal this summer was to hang out with her a couple of times. I couldnt do it until July st because our birthdays were both in June and I didnt want eachother having to hang out with eachother because its our birthday. And after our birthdays we had a missions trip to Peru for  days. During those  days something happened between us and long story short she said she was slipping away from liking me but I asked one of the youth leaders who was talking to her most of the trip and she said that she doesnt really know how she feels right now shes been through alot so I can understand. Anyways so since her saying that ive pretty much wimped out on asking her to hangout until yesterday because I felt like it would accelerate the process of finding out if she likes me or not so I was like why not. I got nothing to lose and so I asked her and I may be overreacting but this was such a crappy response. She said sure I guess. WAS IT REALLY NECESSARY TO ADD THE I GUESS PART? anyways so we are going bowling Wednesday so wish me luck guys since ive never went out with a girl by myself before since usually if I was out with a girl I liked it would be with other friends also.,nbacirclejerk,cukxxs9,13,t5_2td2i

4983348,0,t1_cumof8j,We all know about it and we all see it. Its obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it but its there.People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.The first question to ask why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer you didnt watch him in his prime.Likely explanation I know that most of you are around  or  years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.And because you didnt watch him in his prime you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But heres the thing basketball isnt played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up true          shooting percentage or win shares I know they know nothing about basketball.Kobes game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. Hes the second greatest SG ever and one of the  best players to ever play the game.So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant I laugh because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldnt think that. Unlike you guys I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time so I know that Kobe is better.You might be jealous of Kobes five rings or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history or whatever. Unless youre a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the s or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the s you dont know what real coldblooded killer instinct willtowin basketball looks like. And theres nothing wrong with that.This sub would make you think that Kobe isnt even a top  player ever.So dont go spouting bullshit about players you didnt watch. Talk about your greats like LeBron James The Best Player in the World but leave the Kobe talk to the adults. Fair? I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

5435886,0,t1_cw6hlws,i disagree. Some people dont use analytics to reinforce a bias. I for example create formulas all the time to help me rank players its a hobby of mine. I for example created one for basketball. I put all players who entered the league between  and  I will eventually do all but its time consuming. Then I analyzed how frequently each stat led to points for both teams. Once I had a raw score I figured out how good each player was compared to people of their era then I began weighting each era based on how good or bad it was to the whole leagues history. I created the spreadsheet because I was trying to create an objective way to prove that LeBron James was overrated and paled in comparison to Jordan. But I needed it to be bias free so that I could convince people I was arguing that I was right. Imagine my shock when in order my spreadsheet kicked out after weighting in order  Wilt Chamberlain Magic Johnson LeBron James and then Jordan. I search for errors in my logic underlying the formulas and found none. So I started examining my findings. Heres what I ultimately concluded. Jordan is actually probably the most overrated player in history. Dont get me wrong hes great Im not knocking the guy. But because everyone thinks hes far and away the best of all time that makes him the most overrated. What I determined was that Jordan... Played on one of the best teams of the era. When Jordan retired to play baseball if you actually recreate the season youll see that contrary to popular belief that he saved the Bulls post season hopes the Bulls were WELL on pace to make the playoffs without him and that the reason they just made it is because when he came back he was rusty AND demanded the ball a lot which basically cost Chicago games sacrilege to point out I know but thats what the facts indicate. In addition Jordan played on teams that were far better than average at rebounding the ball and in fact many of the guys Chicago picked up were basically there because of how great their rebounding was especially Dennis Rodman. This led to a scenario where Chicago got the ball MUCH more frequently than their opponents. Which in turn led to much more shooting attempts for Chicago which in turn led to much more shooting attempts for Jordan. Jordan also played in an era of the shortened three point line which led to his his point totals being inflated and also inflated his pt as well as his overall FG because now he didnt need to take longer threes when his team needed threes. Jordan also had boosted defensive numbers because he played in one if the worst offensive eras of basketball history ever. Which led to more turnovers which both led to more turnovers as well as increasing his defensive numbers.  However contrary to popular belief that the offensive numbers were down in this era because of great defense the steal and block percentages are not too significantly higher during this era but more significabtly pace dropped which as far as my research showed tended to occur when the offense is not as potent vs. The norm as opposed to when defense is actually better. When defense is better you tend to see drops in FG as guys are forced into more difficult shots. When pace drops its usually because teams are trying to slow the game down so that they take higher percentage shots because they lack the talent to get into a shooting match with the other team. Lastly Jordan is essentially a one dimensional player. Hes much better at shooting than the average. But adjusted for how bad the league was at offense his defensive numbers are a little better than average for blocks and steals for his position. This essentially relegates him to be either a two or three positionaly. Jordan lacked the size to play either the four or five slits. And hes generally speaking not really going to do much to help his teammates get more looks because of how low his assist rate is compared to both LeBron and Magic.  In fact when I further analyzed all the players that played both with and without Jordan in terms of their era adjusted score on my spreadsheet I found that ONLY BJ Armstrong fared better overall with Jordan than without. By comparison nearly every player that played with LeBron or Magic fared better with them than without them.  Both LeBron and Magic have both size and dexterity as well as court vision which allows them to play all five positions. Additionally they both played in ERAS with a standard three point line so their scoring numbers are somewhat compressed as opposed to Jordans. Both guys also taut HUGE inprovements when joining their respective teams. Magic for example took the Lakers to the Championship in his rookie season which included starting game one of the finals in place of AbdulJabbar at center and was a game that on total he played much better than veteran opponent Daryl Dawkins. But when Magic left even though there were no other significant departures the team got much worse. Same thing with Kebrin. He comes the team is instantly better and he gets them to the finals very quickly. Then he leaves they become much worse despite no other major changes to the roster. He comes back and theyre instantly better. Meanwhile Wilt at the top of my list is another beast entirely. Nearly every season he LEADS a team into the finals. He posted simply gaudy numbers.  pt games games with over  boards season scoring averages over ppg. Season where his FG is like around  which is like  higher than league average. So after I analyzed everything I realized you can EASILY make a case that Jordan is overrated.  That LeBron and Magic have very legitimate claims that they might overall be more helpful to a team than Jordan. And that you can also easily argue in favor of Wilt being better for different reasons. Once I realized all that I realized my hypothesis that LeBron was overrated and that he could hold against Jordan was wrong. So in other words analytics really helped me see the league differently and its expressly because analytics allowed me to peel back the biases I had and really examine things on a factual level. So I know there are people like me who definetly do NOT try to use analytics to reinforce biases. I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

5579893,0,t1_cwoqj37,Given the way youve articulated your opinion of Grantland and Zach Lowe I can see why hes not your cup of tea. Not everyone likes the same things. Thankfully Steven A. Smith is very readily available for your enjoyment.Simmons is a chronicler of NBA history. Im glad that he emphasizes how critical this trade was and how it prematurely ended what definitely wouldve been one of the greatest trios of alltime.NBA analysts and really all sports analysts have gotten so cozy with players and front office members because of the increased access and exposure the media has these days. Popular sports media members get invited to parties and dinners and events. They know their words are going to be amplified in social media and the multitude of news outlets. They dont want to get on anyones bad side. In short its become a bunch of professional slurpers.Simmons isnt afraid to repeatedly slam the Thunder. Hes the white version of Charles Barkley just less funny. He doesnt give a damn.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

5648688,0,t3_3shmxn,We all know about it and we all see it. Its obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it but its there.People on this subreddit hate Kobe Bryant.The first question to ask why? Why do you all hate him? The obvious answer you didnt watch him in his prime.Likely explanation I know that most of you are around  or  years old. That means you only got into basketball in the last couple years. So you never watched Mamba in his prime.And because you didnt watch him in his prime you try to compensate for that by diving into stat sheets and analyzing box scores. But heres the thing basketball isnt played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up true          shooting percentage or win shares I know they know nothing about basketball.Kobes game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. Hes the second greatest SG ever and one of the  best players to ever play the game.So when I hear somebody say that LeBron James is better than Kobe Bryant I laugh because I know that anybody who watched Kobe in his prime wouldnt think that. Unlike you guys I have watched basketball for a significant amount of time so I know that Kobe is better.You might be jealous of Kobes five rings or jealous of his status as the greatest scorer in NBA history or whatever. Unless youre a Bulls fan who watched basketball in the s or a Lakers fan who watched basketball in the s you dont know what real coldblooded killer instinct willtowin basketball looks like. And theres nothing wrong with that.This sub would make you think that Kobe isnt even a top  player ever.So dont go spouting bullshit about players you didnt watch.

And with that sun peaking through now the morning fog. Right between Otay Mountain and Mount San McGill the two mountains that Juan Cabrillo when he came here so many centuries ago identified as his beacons to find this most spectacular natural harbor. And so with the eucalyptus forest the morning dew dripping off that the marsupials looking for something to drink because it has been very very dry out here. And then with the glistening rays of that sunshine illuminating the water the canyons the valleys working on my early morning todo list I realized that theres two burning things that I have to get done today.Number one is to thank Mike Golic for standing up to the faceless and anonymous guys who went after Curt Schillings daughter. And what he did there was so inspirational and so heartwarming that it just...it changed my life forever.The other thing that I have to get done and as we move into the NBA playoffs today is that I am in desperate need Im going to the NBA finals.

I myself am moving to France in the beginning of next year so this post is really about me and not the terror victims and am deeply saddened and disgusted by this act of terrorism because I dont want to fucking die when I move to Paris which I might have mentioned I am doing. Also I decided to make a special player card for the three French players who played yesterday  Nicolas Batum Joakim Noah Alexis Ajinca and Evan Fournier I hope you dont mind. idk who the fuck would give a shit.

And with that sun peaking through now the morning fog. Right between Otay Mountain and Mount San McGill the two mountains that Juan Cabrillo when he came here so many centuries ago identified as his beacons to find this most spectacular natural harbor. And so with the eucalyptus forest the morning dew dripping off that the marsupials looking for something to drink because it has been very very dry out here. And then with the glistening rays of that sunshine illuminating the water the canyons the valleys working on my early morning todo list I realized that theres two burning things that I have to get done today.Number one is to thank Mike Golic for standing up to the faceless and anonymous guys who went after Curt Schillings daughter. And what he did there was so inspirational and so heartwarming that it just...it changed my life forever.The other thing that I have to get done and as we move into the NBA playoffs today is that I am in desperate need Im going to the NBA finals. And I am taking two people with me as my free guests. And Im just looking for those people and maybe I just figured that I could come on your subreddit this morning and figure out if theres some way that I could find those two people to be my free guests at this years NBA finals.Good morning guys.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

10271167,0,t3_5n2zrl,Seriously Derrick Rose cannot shoot. Look at him over the last  games specifically. He looks like hes mad that Jimmy Butler is obviously better than him and idk if Derrick can handle being second best. You know what? Even Pau is better than Derrick because Pau has class. Derrick is just so fucking salty and to try and get better he takes a bunch of threes to try and look like Steph Curry Da Based God instead. And look where that gets him? He has like a  from Stephs Zone.  I bet Shaq could shit the ball out and still have a better percentage from behind the arc. You know who has  more killer instinct than DRose? Classy Tim Duncan. Im going to miss him when hes gone. Injuries suck I love you kawhi.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

10406076,0,t3_5p14xo,smh at this comment. A healthy Clippers and Rockets team will destroy OKC. Stop acting like OKC are so good they didnt even make the playoffs last year. And what the fuck did the spurs prove for them to be on that list? Getting Aldridge  West? WTF? They got smacked by the Clippers last year.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

Most of it would be over everyones head anyway.  This sub is more for casual fans who wont really get stuff like that. ,nbacirclejerk,ddnr7xz,9,t5_2td2i

11786892,0,t3_686let,To be honest I hate all sports media on ESPN. Its a bunch if people who make generalizations about the game. Like when someone says Andrew Wiggins has a lot potential but Jabari is more ready I would actually like to know what they mean by that. Analysts talk about more the what than the why. But if you watch something like SportsCenter its even worse. They usually just hire attractive people that dont really know what their talking about. Take Kristen Ledlow from NBATV for example. Attractive yes. Did she play basketball ever no. Has she ever given insight to anything about to basketball no. They just hired a volleyball player who looks good. Look up Mark Cuban in First Take and youll see what I mean when I say that Sports media in General is terrible.I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.
