10878831,0,t3_5otngo,Ive had some bones get funky or found mossy. Ive had a lot of luck with popping it in some diluted white vinegar for a couple of hours not too long or it will erode bone and then giving it a wash in hot water and decreasing doh soap. I dry it in a container of borax if Im worried the funk isnt totally gone or its humid to make sure the funk doesnt have any moisture available to keep growing. ,bonecollecting,de22odb,2,t5_2v27u
