179851,0,t1_ceywsqh,Yeah the missing episodes is a real ballache.  You can blame the BBC for that.  In the s they would randomly wipe tapes if they needed new tape without checking what was on it.  Add that to a total disdain for scifi shared by all of the higherups at the BBC and youve got a recipe for lost episodes.They still have all of the audio tracks for every episode and theyve been reconstructing some of them by animating the action around the audio. Sounds like it would be shit but Ive watched one and it was done very well.  The team they got to do it had a lot of respect for the job.My favourite Doctor of all time is the Second Patrick Troughton.  But of the new ones Id say probably The Ninth Christopher Eccleston.  Although I may be biased cos were both from the north and its always good to hear a northern accent on British TV.,randomactsofamazon,ceyx5ft,2,t5_2ugqo

2197810,0,t1_clj6p1p,Thanks! Id have to say the biggest difference is in the people and how much nicer they are. Now Chicago is one of my favorite cities by far but everything is working against you if you live there. You get paid less but housing taxes property income sales everything is more expensive while the government is shamelessly corrupt. When everything is harder its harder to be optimistic. Out here people are cheerful. A stranger will smile if you make eye contact and everyone seems much more optimistic. Sometimes to what may be a naive degree especially with the enormous hippy crowd out here but better than not at all. Theres also far less crime so thats nice. However it is significantly less diverse which can inadvertently cause racism from the more ignorant which of course is not so great but the neighborhoods themselves are more diversified I think. I havent seen any clear cut ghettos so thats another plus. Either way still overwhelmingly nicer on a large scale.Honestly Ive never lived anywhere so beautiful filled with people who love it here. I remember in high school everyone would talk about where they wanted to move after graduating. It was assumed no one wanted to stay. Here I meet people happy and consider themselves lucky to have lived here. Its true and I cant imagine living anywhere else.It is also worth saying that I absolutely love Chicago but its a destination for me now. Not a home.Sorry that was kinda long.,randomactsofamazon,clj72h5,1,t5_2ugqo

Be passionate about math you need to know math to become a great programmer  computer scientist. Aim to be great not good.. Learn a language the right way dont take those Learn x in y days shortcuts. Check out the Learn Code The Hard Way series. Id recommend starting with Python or Ruby CC are really great and powerful languages but you should be worrying about writing beautiful algorithms at this stage not about pointers and memory. Learn CC a little later. Java is a pain in my opinion but you might want to pick it up solely because of popularity.. Do not write crappy code just because you are solving a simplesmall problem. Paraphrasing a classic quote make your drills are bloodless battles and your battles bloody drills. Practice as though you are writing code for a competition  final exam. Keep trying to improve what you have written.ampnbspYes I spoke a lot about code. Programming is the basic tool in CS. But theres a lot to do in computer science! Data science all the big data hype computer networks information security information visualization check out rdataisbeautiful for instance... Theres so much out there! Keep your options open think about where you want to be.ampnbspA few more good resources  Coursera courses such as this designed to help students with very little or no computing background. Finally feel free to PM me anytime you want advice. If I cant answer you Ill talk to my friends  the faculty in my department and get you advice.,randomactsofamazon,co6gp2t,2,t5_2ugqo

2998668,0,t3_2uiyyr,Funny I explain this to my wife all the time. I do not dress or live how I would if I had the means or opportunity. Mens clothes are so lame and if I do find something its ridiculously priced. I am envious of women in this way they have way more options in regards to clothing style and said options are much more accessible and affordable. If I was a girl I would dress like some kind of bohemian with lots of accessories and a gypsy vibe one day a total mod beatnik the next and a s poodle skirt and saddle shoes the day after that. But Im a guy so its pants and a shirt every...single...day...zzzzzzzzzz. Im a big fan of quality and comfort so my aesthetic would be lots of merino wool absolutely no visible brand names fitting but not restrictive well made. Also any sport coat would have a custom liner with an unorthodox pattern or color.    Also regarding home decor I always dreamed of having a different style for different rooms. For instance a cozy den with oversized leather furniture exposed beams and lots of wood for a mountain cabin feel a music listening room with a modern feel and lots of steel and glass a s kitchen with a booth a game room straight out of the s with shag carpet and stained glass and so on.,randomactsofamazon,co8t5y8,1,t5_2ugqo

4043585,0,t3_36tsn1,Congratulations on graduating! I still got at least  more before I walk.Im a music ed major so at the end of each semester I have to do whats called a jury which is basically a final performance on my instrument. Its stressful because you do it in front of your private studio professor and two other music faculty. For the fourth semester jury its a bit different. Its called the barrier. Its the same performance in front of ALL the music faculty around a dozen. This is hands down the most stressful part of my degree if you dont pass you get kicked out of the program.Anyway I was one of two that passed the barrier this semester. So I guess thats my big accomplishment.,randomactsofamazon,crh777y,1,t5_2ugqo

Its unfinished and not the first time its flooded so there wasnt too much damage just the dryer motor. This will be the second time Ive had to replace the stupid motor due to flooding. You think Id be smart enough to put the thing up on blocks already though. The problem with dryers is that the motor is located at the very bottom of the unit and almost never work again no matter how much  how long you dry it out. Its an easy fix but at    a motor it adds up. Still though its just a clothes dryer not a human life.

4175304,0,t3_38lr2d,When I was around  or  ish my grandparents and my aunts came to visit my family. We all decided come to think of it it was probably just them telling my brother and me that we were going to go to a waterpark. I was ecstatic! I was never nor for how athletic I see myself as now still am not a good swimmer. But I loved water parks! I love the lazy rivers and I loved playing in the little kid area with all the water cannons and water spouts and small slides. So we drive to the place. For whatever reason the name is escaping me . But we get out of the packed minivan apply sunscreen and split into two groups. In one group its my grandparents my aunts my mom and myself were the more gentle ride group. The other group is my brother dad and my uncle. Theyre going to ride all the coolest and scariest rides.We spent our day splashing in the shallow end of the pools. Floating in the lazy river. Playing on the kiddie crap. I was a great day! But it did have to end. My mom calls my grandma and I to get out of the lazy river and come to the chairs so we can get ready to leave.  So we oblige. We get to the chairs and theres the other group. Its the first time Ive seen them since we had got to the park. Theyre soaked from head to toe and look pretty exhausted. My brothers face is pink from the recently applied sunblock covering his sunburnt nose and cheeks.Everyone ready to go? my mom chimed. My brother whined that they never got to ride one ride and he wanted to do it before we left. We could see it from our spot. The line was short and it was a short ride. OK she says we can all go ride that and then well leave. I wont lie I was a little nervous but everyone else seemed to like the idea and before I had time to even think we were already at the front of the line. I looked down. It was a huge water slide each person went alone in their own adult sized tube. My face. I cried to my mom to let me not ride it. She said it was too late and that I had until the rest of the family had gone to man up.I cried and whined and probably made a huge scene which didnt help my case. And then the guy working the slide just picked me up and dropped me into a tube. Being the scrawny little child I was my butt slid right through the middle of the tube and scraped the rough bottom of the slide. The current of the slide sucked me right into it before I could situate myself in the tube. My lower back got scraped up a little bit. At the end everyone was waiting for me. I got there and my grandpa asks me that wasnt so bad was it? I didnt respond I just cried the whole way home. I still have a scar from that slide and have a problem with being picked up while Im in water. tldr went to waterpark at age ish came back scarred physically and mentally for life ,randomactsofamazon,crw6vyv,1,t5_2ugqo

Charons mass.

Go you!!Im on Megabus WiFi so no pics unfortunately but I will post things that I love.. Currently I love what I can make my body do I havent been able to say that for years and years almost a decade but right now Im proud of and happy with what my body can finally do.  I never thought Id be able to say walking  average is no big deal that IS such a big deal for me.  For so long Ive felt trapped in a body I hated that I felt betrayed by but now my body does things I never thought possible.  I dont care that my weight doesnt seem to be changing much because I am healthier I have a capable body that can take me to all these beautiful and amazing places that I never thought I would see.  Thank you for reminding me to appreciate that Ive thought about it recently hiking straight uphill to our tent the other day for example but I hadnt really taken the time to live myself for it D. I love my hair!! Its never exactly the same color twice and I love to play with it.  I posted pics of it a couple weeks ago..  I love my ability to see things from a different perspective.  i also love that my teachers feel that way too . I love my geekiness and weirdness.  Its so much fun and I LOVE nerding out!!!.  I love my brain....even when I hate it.  My brain tortures me and makes me feel yucky sometimes but it also shows me the world and lets me see the whole picture.  Thats invaluable and will help me make the changes in the world that I want to see.Thats all I want to say for now besides thank you again Im so glad youre doing what you need to to be happier and in the process you made a whole bunch more people happy too!!! ltlt,randomactsofamazon,cssvezd,2,t5_2ugqo

I dont even get to leave my state. My honeymoon was to Atlanta and it was honestly shitty. I dont want to go into details about that but anyway. I wanted to take a cruise for graduating. Im losing my job on Tuesday because Ive been in it too long. Husbands picking up a second job i hope but were always so tight on money that I know we wont be able to save for a cruise. I know my family wont help. I am doubting theyll even attend the graduation ceremony.So dwelling on my great grandmothers passing and dwelling on the future I want are bumming me out.

Paperbackswap was the best thing that ever happened to me!I also have a rather impressive collection of guitar picks  like seriously more than I could ever use in my life  and a somewhat smaller collection of picks that Ive broken while playing. At one point I was thinking of making them into a necklace or something but as Ive gotten older and wiser Ive realized that would be incredibly tacky PI suppose you could say I have a collection of pens I am very picky about which pens I use so every time I run out I pick up a pack of Ive never used before. I have a steadilygrowing classification of good and bad pens and as a sideeffect a desk drawer full of pens I will never write with again.Music? I love music. I dont think Ive ever heard a song that Ive actively disliked. Some are better than others obviously but theres value in all of it. I have a rather modest song library right now but I hope to see it grow. Sometimes when Im in the mood for music Ill browse iTunesAmazon looking for great lengthprice ratios. One of my favorite such purchases was an LSO album of all of Beethovens symphonies which was over  hours of music for  dollars.,randomactsofamazon,ctpdphy,1,t5_2ugqo

She was  months old at the time and I was over the moon because I had always wanted a pet. She was mainly my dads dog but I had inadvertently trained her to always sit still around me for petting. She was weird crazy and adorable. She died at  after eating a rat and getting sick from it while living in my grandpas house after we moved back to the US.We also had a few more dogs afterwards including a really sweet golden lab puppy and a mutt who was always trying to get out he was way too rambunctious so we didnt have him for long.
