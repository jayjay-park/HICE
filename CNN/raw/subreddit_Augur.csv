It also let me go through the process of submitting a market not clear what timetimezone it ends at that might need to be changed.  Then I clicked on a market and I seem to have been logged out.Tried to log back in using the same emailpassword and had no luck nothing happens.  I can reregister though.  After reregistering the droplets no longer do anything and the counters for cash and Reputation went back to zero Ether stays at .  I was able to repeat this a few times.

6919054,0,t1_d0zydtn,I understand that Augur needs to settle. Ok. I dont know about american stock markets but in europe you can buy and sell during the day as many times you wish as the broker instantly credits you the money when you sell. They can do it because on regulated markets almost all stocks  trades are guaranteed by the Central Counterparty. Clearing processes central counterparties make the Settlement process very eficient. Of course this kind of centralized processes are not an option in Augur but Please we should not underrate the capabilities of centralized systems that would be cheating to ourselves. ,Augur,d10ljk3,2,t5_2qnf6

6975377,0,t1_d16y8pz,I hear you on assigning markets to reporters.Im thinking about an abstain option that could be used in something like up to X number of assigned markets per reviewerreview period. Reviewers could abstain for any reason. They would only get a small number of abstentions and would be forced to use them wisely. Heres why with a simple exampleWill team X win over team Y on March th? this is from a real market for review right nowTeam X amp Y didnt play on the th. They played on the th. a I can assume probably correctly that the author just got the date wrong and report that team X won and I can also assume also probably correctly that most people wont catch the error or like me if they do catch it they will play the Princess Bride game of assuming others are assuming that everyone else is assuming it was just an inadvertent error and go ahead and report that X won or b I can go by what the author actually said and I can acknowledge that the teams did not play that day and I can either choose no that team X did not win over team Y the day they did not play or I can choose indeterminate which is also correct. I am faced with making bad and worse choices.I would like to just pass that hassle by. Or maybe the hassle could be reduced by not penalizing people for trying to resolve issues in a Wikipediastyle review process for markets where troublesissues could be flagged and resolved or even reversed by rewarding participation in troubled markets. I dont particularly want to be dinged for trying in good faith to resolve disputes and all things equal I would be happy to try to resolve issues if I were rewarded for my effort. Or or perhaps and the abstain option above.,Augur,d16zw1a,2,t5_2qnf6

To see why imagine that the IOU exchange was actually causing artificially high prices. If so buyers would begin choosing the lower convenience of using reptrader or waiting til release. As far as I can see the amount of gatecoin supply can only artificially affect the price to the extent that it is more convenient or well known than alternatives. ,Augur,d7m597r,1,t5_2qnf6
