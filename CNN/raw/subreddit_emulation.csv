Youre trying to emulate a modern console in the GameCube so its going to take a lot of processing power.  Every console generation seems to be exponentially more demanding than the last.As for Pokemon Stadium it uses framebuffer effects that are very hard to emulate.  I know Glide  Napalm can emulate them at the expense of speed though.Donkey Kong  is software problems you are correct on that one.Basically with performance unless its something severe its just your system not being powerful enough to run the game.  There are plenty of GameCube games that I cannot run full speed because of the features they use are very hard to emulate on our PCs the same thing happens with PS.  That used to happen in N but PCs have gotten so much faster that you can pretty much tank it on most modern computers.,emulation,ckzo16a,4,t5_2qh6d

Not just because of the fear that our projects might get shut down but because asserting that we have illegal motives essentially devalues us as programmers putting us in the same box as malware programmers.This is why the division exists.

Wall of text incoming!PS Mednafex PSX via RetroArch with composite shaders to make the lowfi graphics more tolerable. AA and resolution bumps might make some things better on the surface but it only makes the disparity between sprite objects and D objects greater and further emphasizes low polygon counts and the lack of a zbuffer. It also doesnt do anything about lowres textures. Beyond the initial setup I havent run into an issue yet.Saturn I... actually dont play Saturn games unfortunately. If I do get to them Ill try out SSF a little bit first. If Im not satisfied Ill seek out an actual Saturn.N On an actual N. The VI filter hides slight graphical problems and smooths out the screen image. Original resolutions and other filters are needed to make offlooking textures look correct. Many might complain about the overall smear factor but for someone whos authenticityfocused like myself its a necessity. Most N emulatorsconfigurations dont provide the VI filter and have an assortment of other issues and the Angrylion plugin is prohibitively slow on just about every system out there. Maybe CEN will change things but that remains to be seen.Dreamcast See Saturn but this time for games never released on later systems and replace SSF with NullDCReicast it depends on when I look into it. I will say though that this is the point where I drop my views on authentic graphical fidelity. Dreamcast games and onwards are good looking enough to where Im fine cranking up graphics settings to max like its a PC game.PS Either on my backwardscompatible PS or my actual PS. I have a central media center and my PS is one of my key parts of it so I like to use it when I can. If input lag is a serious issue for a certain game Ill switch to the PS. For me PCSX just isnt compatible enough to serve as an alternative to the real deal. Im happy to see some recent initiatives on that front though as well as Play! being developed to serve as an interesting competitor.GameCube It depends on the game.

Read up to see if it does this.You also have to know on a general sense what kind of hardware architecture you are running x x AMD ARM etcIll give you a basic overview and you can take it from there. Firstly read the installation documentation for Lakka. I can not overstate this enough. It is vital to your success.From what I read on my brief glance over Lakkas website it is meant to be installed on flash drives and SD cards and to boot from that every time. This may cause problems down the line if installed onto a hard drive. It may also not contain Grub by default.The easiest way to do it is to install Windows first then install Linux. When you go to install Windows you can tell it to take up less space on the drive. I used to just cut my hdd in half and use that space for each partition Now I like linux a lot more. Keep space open and unformatted on the drive for the Linux install.After you have installed windows onto a smaller space on the drive you can start the Lakka installation. It should ask you in the customadvanced install options to use the largest openunformatted space rather than the whole drive. Again read the documentation first.If everything goes to plan when you boot up windows again it will ask you to do a MBR check master boot record. This is okay and normal. Let it go and you should encounter no issues.If you want to do a trial run you can download virtualization software I prefer Virtualbox give it  GB hdd space or we on windows first and simulate the installation inside a virtual machine before you go fullhog on working hardware. Probably a good route.Virtualbox will simulate a fake computer that only sees itself and what you give it. You install just like you would on an actual hardware machine.Lastly it is not difficult to do this. There is a learning curve. Yes you may fail once or even twice. It is only bits and bytes. Whatever you mess up can be fixed.Welcome to the wonderful world of dual booting.,emulation,cv8no18,2,t5_2qh6d

5317555,0,t3_3ntzwv,Everything in the ROM is data stored as bytes each byte being  bits each bit being either  or . No exceptions.  Some is text data meaning each byte stands for a letter generally crazy things like Lagrange Point happened for example in texts using ASCII table the letter A would be encoded as a byte with value  hexadecimal  Some is tile data aka graphics meaning a succession of bits standing for info about each pixel in a graphic and its color number  Further ahead you have palette data which is a list of bytes that are values telling the console which colors stand for each color number in the tile data  And then tile map data which is a list of bytes acting as a guide to assemble a big puzzle out of smaller pieces which are the tile data mentioned above.Oh maybe lists of stats for attack and defense and enemy HP too. Or how large a letter width is. All sorts of things like that. Numbers and numbers are converted to hexadecimal and stored as bytes too.Videos are successions of graphics so theyre stored as bytes too.  Sound is waves. im not very knowledgable about the specifics but sound waves can be written as numbers and bytes. MIDI sequenced music is even easier its a list of calls to sound effects. Each sound effect has a value. So bytes too.  D models are essentially points with lines linking them. Points have coordinates. Coordinates have numbers. Numbers can be written as bytes. Their textures are graphics so bytes too.We have graphics text sound lists stats... to tie all of this together we need programming.  Is it Java? Lua? well its used in recent powerful enough systems C?  With instructions readable by normal human beings like print  read  goto... etc?No console devs work directly on the metal. or rather used to .. oh the sad times were living in. Ever wondered why ShinenEADNaughty Dogs work is so unlike everything else in taking advantage of the full potential of the console?  They directly talk to the machine  thats assembly language.  When C builds the program out of readable instructions building means converting human speak to machine speak.Assembly language coders directly write in machine speak and oh is it obtuse.Each machine has their own machine language NESSNES  MSXGB Z GBADSDS  ARM PSPSPSPNSAT MIPS GCWiiWiiU PowerPC VitaPS same thing cant quite remember though XBPSXBWIN x...  They have an absurdly tiny bunch of registers tiny cases of memory for the brunt of work.  And the processor knows a limited amount of instructions.  Just how to do simple operations like additions.  Even assigning a value to an address is a twostep operation.  These simple instructions are called machine language for a very simple reason.  As my useless introduction said everything is zeroes and ones.  The instruction to add  to the value in an address in the case of SNES for example is written as  followed by the address also in binary like XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX Can you imagine writing a whole program like that?  Considering programmers dont have superhuman memory they decided to call each instruction with an acronym that sounds vaguely English so that they can write programs.  In this case they called that abomination of an instruction above INC sounds like increase niceThats an opcode.  They made programs called assemblers that convert a notepad txt file using opcodes like INC LDASTA the combo for assigning values I talked about above disclaimer opcode names for the same instructions may and will be different for nonSNES assembly languages to the only language the console can understand.....And disassemblers take the code from the ROM and decrypt it to use opcodes readable by humans.,emulation,cvrdoxh,21,t5_2qh6d

In general modifications that make a game easier are not integrated into a full hack as theyre a bit beyond the scope of what most of the romhacking community creates and plays.  A trainer is essentially a rom hack that changes numerical values instead of content.The other comments about Easy Type hacks and using GamesharkPro Action Replay codes are also correct.  Most emulators have Pro Action Replay built in and if you research a bit you can figure out how to make your own codes  this is done by using the RAM watch feature in an emulator doing an action for example finishing a battle to get xp and altering the RAM addresses that change until you find the right one to affect xp gain.If youre going for the old FF games youll find a ton of codes already made though so you should be set.,emulation,cwtm9if,2,t5_2qh6d

However I really dont want to sound like an elitist but I feel that current gen emulation tends to attract the wrong kind of people. Lets not kid ourselves only a tiny fraction of those who use an emulator actually own the games theyre emulating. And while this isnt really an issue with games that came out in the s and have been out of print for decades it is with current games.

Eh that famous translated ROM mightve been released later than Im thinking. Otherwise I was doing TMNT with more cheats and better savestates than the hardware offered. This wouldve been ish on a  MHz P. Once upon a time it was a serious performance hit to stretch your output to fullscreen.ZSNES soon after that. Struggling to run Starfox. Thirdparty chip support was super buggy back then.NoGBs debugger mode was like entering the matrix... and I wouldnt even see The Matrix until like . This was mostly a curiosity since our family had three Game Boys an NES an SNES and eventually a Dreamcast with an old woodpaneled TV in the back corner of the living room. Only the DC was purchased anywhere near its release date.

Thats not the same as actual floating point arithmetic tests and the like that test multiple functions of a CPU to get a real benchmark. When it comes to emulation those tests are irrelevant especially since it tests across multiple OSs. Intels android support is pretty meh still and android really doesnt take full advantage of what an x processor is capable of. Comparing browsing speeds in two separate OSs to test hardware makes no sense.EDIT I just wanted to also agree that yes the PSP will also be full speed in short time and Dolphin may even be playable but probably not smooth until another generation or two go by.

7127897,0,t1_d1o8yjw,Hey byuu I appreciate your work very very much but hasnt the MSU taught you that people may whine in the beginning but end up supporting you in the end? Along with gamepaks and manifests I remember it all having an extremely slow start then ikari came and now ROMHacking and the Zeldix forums are full of orchestral and remixed soundtrack hacks and that cool ALTTP intro. Aside from the recent manifest change nobody whines about gamepaks anymore. Theyre practically the thing that enabled us to use those hacks and thats glorious. Youve made it clear that there is purpose to the apparent madness.Now I realise that enhancement features like this are just really popular. The prevalence of people asking for texture pack and shader support everywhere proves that. And few if any people really are going to care about those obscure peripherals. In my very humble opinion though its been your advocacy of preservation and accuracy that hasslowly and over the yearsled to quite a bit of change in attitude of the scene.Back in the early days of emulation it was more about just playing games. You see a lot more people caring about accuracy and preserving history these days. I personally believe that your steadfastness and public discourselike your evergreen Arstechnica articlehave been a huge part of this change along with the NESdev guys MAMEMESS and countless others. And your decapping fundraisers would never have happened the way they did if people didnt implicitly trust your sincerity to do the right thing. Youve always put your money where your mouth is and people respect that greatly. In terms of advocacy your name is simply something that immediately springs to mindlike Durante or Kaldaien for proper PC porting.Now if you want another highprofile feature that is also in the vein of preserving history you might have to start adding frontend features such as polling databases for box art and short descriptions and such. I know you went to great pains to also scan all the box art and manuals and it pains you that you cant legally share that effort. I also know UI programming is not exactly your favourite thing to do but is it that or the legal grey area that prevents you from adding something like that or both? Theyre such common frontend features and the thirdparty websites providing them have been up for years now. Do you fear that it still may be interpreted as aiding copyright infringement on your part?

Just my WonderSwan work alone for its very first release was two fulltime months of effort. Had I taken a second job for that time were looking at  worth of lost income potential. And I actually did turn down a contracting dev work offer that ended up costing me  because I wanted to work on the WS instead. And no doubt there are many more months ahead for me to work on it. A person isnt going to make a great emulator unless theyre really passionate about the system theyre working on.

7297437,0,t3_4f5juq,GBA emulation? With TempGBAMOD the best emulator variant around its passable. A few more intensive games absolutely struggle Sigma Star Saga in particular is almost unplayable and any game making heavy use of Mode functionality Mario Kart FZero has significant difficulties maintaining a playable framerate.Expect a lot of frameskipping even when games are running at full speed the DS slot bus physically doesnt have the bandwidth to accommodate video streaming at gtFPS so everything will skip frames. That can be quite a distracting effect particularly in light of how many GBA titles depend upon a smooth FPS for various fauxD animation effects. SNES? The best options CatSFC and thats incapable of running a single game on the system at full speed. Even Super Mario World skips frames to the pont of being unplayable. Its an interesting curiosity nothing more. There are far better flashcarts out there. The only circumstance in which a DSTWO is a good idea nowadays is if youre running on a DSi and must have some GBA functionality its just not a good choice otherwise. The huge battery drain in sleep modes another significant downside as is the extent to which the thing heats up when placed in a DS. Just get an Ri Gold DS thats the best DSmode card around nowadays.Dont bother with emulators on the DSLiteDSi. Really. The only one worth playing about with is GameYob GBC the rest are all riddled with inaccuracies and compromises. If you really must have the ability to play GBA titles and youre on a DS Lite just pick up an EZFlash in itll integrate with your Ri to use the DS native GBA hardware to play the games. The DS just isnt a very good emulation platform its screen resolution is too low to allow it to accurately display anything more than GBCGBA games even the NES requires downscaling and the CPU is pretty underpowered it was weak even by  standards after all.,emulation,d27o3fh,3,t5_2qh6d

7522669,0,t1_d2wvsxm,I dont agree with you there. Even in the case of the publisher of a game still making money out of a  year old game you have to think about whether you would have purchased the game if piracy wasnt an option or not. Reality is not like this publishers tend to make us think it is most people if they cant afford a game they wont buy it so the money is lost anyway. Piracy is also a long term form of increasing income. One day when for example a future game of an IP you pirated long time algo launches and you finally have the money to purchase it you may do it as opposed to not having even thought about it if you hadnt played the original game. I cant speak in general but thats happened in my case. I used to pirate a lot of games but now that I have the money to afford them I dont pirate anymore. Ive bought assassins creed games borderlands games age of empires gta and the list goes on. Games that I would not have bought if I hadnt pirated older ones. Maybe the only ones that get hurt from piracy are indie devs but even in that case the prices of their games are usually so low I didnt even bother pirating. You have to take into account as well that many publishers say that piracy is killing their business when in reality what they may have in hands are subpar overpriced games that no one would buy.If the game deserves it and the price is fair people buy it is that simple. You can put minecraft as an example one of the most pirated games in history  which in fact has gained popularity accessibility and millions of sells thanks to it. And thats why as well steam sales are such a success because when a price is fair people dont even bother pirating it if they can afford it.,emulation,d2xagsx,35,t5_2qh6d

8059272,0,t1_d4lulor,gt The same idea could be used for palette swapping with powerups Mega Man for example or Fire Flower Mario. Also some games have numbers in the vram that change per level. You could say that if world  is showing in Mario Land which it would see the values of the  at this address and the  at this one then show image .Im pretty sure we discussed using RAM values like that a couple of months ago didnt we? In reality its not much different from checking the VRAM address via the EXTVRAMADDR parameter in manifest files so checking actual RAM addresses or any memory location for a specified value isnt too much. Out of all the suggestions Ive received its probably one of the simplest to implement  user friendly. Wed just expand manifest entries with something like a EXTRAMVALUE parameter. That would be most useful for Mega Man powerups and other cool things like status effects in Pokemon but anything fancier than saying If RAMADDRESS  some value display this custom graphics if not then display this other custom graphics and you basically start rewriting the games rendering engine on a metalevel. The goal from the start was to make something comparable to the HD Textures we see for N GC and Wii games but for D games.I guess my philosophy is to generally have things static in the sense that I prefer having fewer conditions the emulator needs to check and verify before replacing graphics. The base condition is whether or not the hash matches and optional checks right now include VRAM addresses. Im fine with animations and RAM value checking and those are actually exciting things Id like to see when I get back to CGFX in the fall but things above that wind up complicating matters for endusers. I dont want GBE to get to the point where its basically reprogramming how a games graphics work. So in other words parallax scrolling is a little too exotic.But anyway yeah RAM value checking is simple really. I think Ive told you I was going to work on it a while ago.

8268188,0,t1_d5a2gkv,As a  year mGalaxy user I will give my  cents and correct some wrong informations if you dont mind gt Adding emulators is pretty easy and just asks what emulator you are going to use and than asks for some specific paths.Thats right you simply drag the system you want to emulate it couldnt be more simple then  at least  give the path to the emu and rom folders!gt One thing I do not like is that despite a notice saying that the videos and covers folders are not necessary you cannot create an emulator setup without themThats not correct sorry!!gt It also doesnt appear to have support for adding things like separate windows games but does have a fair variety of emulators.Windows game are simply supported! Youll have to create shortcuts to your game inside a folder then as for other systems give path to that folder!gt doesnt show the game descriptions unless you press a separate button to enable it and even then it tends to cover up the art it pulls down such as here and looks somewhat tacked on whereas Launchbox has it front and centerYes mGalaxy philosophy is not Launchbox philosophy! Game info is not the heart of the interface and is displayed as a panel so you showhide it with a button indeed!. This panel is semitransparent and if youre then owner of a  screen does not cover the main display.gt The biggest issue for me is how it opens and runs in Windows. If you are running two monitors it full screens on one and is set to always remain on top while always outputting the emulator to the other screen that you set. I wish I could set it to open the emulator on the same screen the frontend is on to get around that.Thats not correct my friend! mGalaxy doesnt always output on the second display! The monitor setting is only present to tell mGalaxy where it should open on a multimonitor config! Its up to you to choose the same window for mGalaxy than for your emulators!!gt Overall if you use Launchbox you will probably just want to stick with that since Launchbox also has Big Box mode and does pretty much everything this does a little bit better.I personally have done the inverse  !! I was on Launchbox and switched to mGalaxy which is far easy go takes far less resources is more pretty in my opinion,emulation,d5b2y10,0,t5_2qh6d

I set mine up with Hyperspin and its been working great.

I bought the  but you could always add an sd card or an external drive and achieve the same thing for  bucks less. I also bought a couple of bitdo snes controllers for snes emulation and they work really well. For everything else I use the nvidia controller.

8505738,0,t1_d64r082,gt My only issue is that it appears to me that you completely dismiss any possibility of there being a way to reduce input lag.Try and think of it like this ... someone gives you a proof that . Theyre  convinced. Do you have to entertain them and find the error in their proof? Ive done just that dating all the way back to . Ive done it so many times wasted so much effort that Im tired of it.I did my absolute best to explain this in my article. Clearly Ive failed to be persuasive. Thats my fault Im sorry.But heres where I stand ... someone gave me a patch for a fork of a modified version of an emulator core I discontinued a while ago for an emulator frontend with hardware interface code I didnt write. And said that several forum users there found the patch helped things. I am not even questioning any of that.Im talking about my project and saying I am at least  confident his idea wont decrease latency by the purported ms he quotes. And my article spent three hours trying unsuccessfully to explain why that is.But by all means Im not going to deny reality. Im just not going to do all the hard work of disproving it. If someone else wants to spend their time on that port the patch to higan do solid AB testing compile results and findings ... more power to them! If they empiracally prove it and no subjective opinion isnt proof ... its placebo see wine tasting tell people its a more expensive wine and they enjoy it more. Tell people latency is reduced here and they believe you then I will humbly admit I was wrong and make the appropriate changes.I really do have a long history of admitting when I am wrong. A certain poster in this thread was pointing it out to ridicule me but I think it makes the exact opposite point that I am reasonable and admit my mistakes.All I want is for people to stop demanding that I do all the work provingdisproving everyone elses theories all the time.

9009901,0,t3_53m5i1,gt So i was wondering if Devs could use emulation to fix this. Like how they fixed sprite limitations of the NES and instead of flickering sprites when the sprite limit is reached you get solid sprites something that the real NES couldnt do.Others have explained why this wont work wo modifying the ROMs so let me just contrast it with the sprite example. In this case the NES hardware selects which of  sprites are drawn on a scanline out of a pool of up to  so its easy to override by changing how the emulated NES works. In the audio case the game software has to decide itself which channels are selected so its logic would need to be changed. If there existed a console that had hardware to managed a subset of sound channels to play simultaneously out of a larger pool this could be changed in emulation. But I dont know of any console that works this way.,emulation,d7uulaz,10,t5_2qh6d

9090460,0,t3_54ndvg,It has arguably already been a problem although one thats difficult to gauge because there have been other barriers in emulating platforms like XBox  and PS that could be masking the issue.Its a single order kind of issue so it shouldnt really be getting worse indefinitely. What I mean is that the consoles themselves will also hit slowdown in single threaded performance. What I think well eventually see is that the single threaded performance on consoles will be somewhat close to the single threaded performance on higher end PCs because the area and power budget needed to achieve those levels will be small enough to where its not worth avoiding it.This is kind of an offshoot of your question but hypothetically speaking there are probably features that CPU manufacturers could add that would enable lower overhead emulation. Possibilities off the top of my head Low cost user space callbacks for certain classes of memory exceptions Programmable CAMs like a user customizable TLB More registers not a problem with some current archs Ability to suppress flag generation not a problem with some current archs and Intel toyed with the idea in their ARM emulation studies Flagless testcmp  branch instructions Speculative execution like with Intels TSX but more tuned for straight speculation and actually available across all their processors Low overhead thread communication primitives Speculative multithreading this would potentially make a lot of single threaded stuff faster.. lo and behold Intel did just acquire Soft Machines... Features that provide a lower barrier of entry for using virtualization modes without having to write an entire operating system  that is low overhead transitioning to host OSes to handle OS stuff Multiple address spaces maybe Fast asserts for rarely taken events A small tightly integrated bit of FPGA fabric with few cycle latency might smooth over some particularly onerous cases like weird floating point modes in PS More robust SIMD instruction sets. AVX is getting there.Some of these features are already on nVidias Denver  a processor that was basically designed for emulation. Maybe if we had something like Denver but the actual ability for end users to program it with its native instruction set.All of this only really applies to emulating CPUs and other CPUlike pieces like vector coprocessors it doesnt help much with GPUs.

Then the emu translates that  bit call to the equivalent  bit version and makes the real api call returning the value to the emulated program.The  bit versions are the same functions roughly as you find in modern Windows its just that modern x cpus cant execute  bit AND  bit AND  bit applications at the same time interestingly you CAN still run them in a  bit mode but its exclusively  bit.

9373658,0,t1_d945ylw,gtARM is no harder than any emulating other CPU architecture. Emulating an ARMv core would certainly require more gruntwork than the simpler ARM architectures but really I feel the CPU is the least of your concerns since its so well documented. I feel that the greater issue would be the unknowns such as the graphics architecture of the SoC but that is pure speculation.Thats what I was looking for glad to hear that theres no hurdle for Switch emulation especially considering that it seams to be the only system that Nintendo will develop for in the future.

9742704,0,t1_dadzd9p,Framebuffer mapped as virtual memory for the CPU is indeed the hardest feature to emulate fast. Ishiiruka has a hacky feature to delay those requests by one frame but this still breaks a few games. But good luck to get relyable results on the real hardware they also need a lot of synchronization overhead. So those accesses are very rare.Texture copies to main memory however is a very common feature also of desktop GPUs. Just look for nvidia optimus. To do this fast its a good idea to implement some kind of page locking in the CPU emulation. So you can continue with the CPU emulation until this page is used. As  of the times this page will only be used by the GPU again keeping it in VRAM is also wise. This will help with all kind of rendertotexture scanout without memcpy  times per second and a perfect texture cache. Citra had a good article about it called texture forwarding.gt But today with  core CPUsThat was my point in the last comments. Writing a SW renderer which supports multi threaded is by far not trivial. So all youll get is your  GHz CPU which already do all kind of other operations. Still fine for native resolutions. Likely not fine for HD. Especially if you dont want to implement a just in time compiler for the rendering state.,emulation,dae012b,8,t5_2qh6d

9790760,0,t1_dajwf3q,Short repsonse  I agree with you anyone bitching about  ms is a fool.  Long response  Yeah they all have lag and the difference of    ms is not perceptible. When you get in the ranges of  ms  frames on a  Hz display and up is where it does become noticeable and I am by no means one of those people that are sensitive to it.  Just as an example in my  setups my main gaming PC with a very low latency Asus ROG GSync TN panel monitor and wired controller it is way better than my Samsung TV gaming mode on and wireless controller.  It is most noticeable in a game like Street Fighter where I can easily pull off combos on my main rig but I have to be a bit more deliberate on my TV. Before I learned how to tweak emulator settings Retroarch and reduce the latency as much as possible pulling off combos was extremely difficult. I have no idea how much latency was there in the worst case scenario because I have no reliable way of measuring.

9901194,0,t1_day3npu,One of the major goals of Retroarch is to make cores run on all systems without rewriting. Cores that require hardware specific features like PCSX ReArmed working only on ARM processors cant be ported.There are also different graphics drivers in Retroarch software GL and Vulkan. Some cores only run under specific drivers. PPSSPP and Mupen require GL for instance. As such they wont run in a software only retroarch port like Vita and DS. The Vulkan driver is still experimental and works only in Windows and Android. Even then only on specific supported hardware.Dolphin support will likely be iffy for a while. If for no other reason the differences in UI and controller support will make it less convenient for many. The advantage Retroarch will offer is being able to run GCNWii games on more and more hardware over time.,emulation,day5cw6,5,t5_2qh6d

9977801,0,t1_db84ghb,Theory time i guess. It has to do with affordance On a stick for example the notion of degrees of successmotion is inbuilt into the internalized concept of the user of a controller stick. On a button instead the most often used internalized concept is all or nothing  think of examples like light switches keyboards ringers etc. Sure it can be overridden by learned behavior but that doesnt change the fact that every joeuser is going to be tripped at least once much more than once realistically considering how the vast majority of games will ignore the sensitivity.And never minding this highflung theory there is the fact that pressure sensitive buttons are less than worth the trouble they bring due to needing the delay the games interpretation of a action until it is finished ie the button released or a timer finished if theyre going to multiple interpretations increasing latency.If they dont have multiple interpretations but only a delta over time keeping a button pressed is just as well for less brain power.AND the fact theyre sensitive and small in degrees of pressure makes it so that a great deal of gamers that arent all that precise will get frustrated by doing things they hadnt meant if the functions were just separated into single buttons. My two cents on why theyre a bad user interface idea but im not a expert or anything. Im sure a UI theorist would have more ideas to fling.,emulation,db84vwm,1,t5_2qh6d

10429662,0,t1_dcppehr,Theyre not wrong that a majority of the emulation scene is piracy which is where their stance develops. And an archival backup would be fine if you werent distributing it. For some reason the emulation community continues to screw that part up. No one here regardless of whether or an individual owns a copy of some game has the right to download a copy of a game unless it is from the IP holder themselves Or some location they gave permission to distribute. A true preservation model would be a tightly controlled inaccessible archive of games for every system. If the time came that those things became public domain theyd be OK to allow for download. That is not what we have so its truly just piracy. Noble piracy but piracy nonetheless. Lets be realistic. If Nintendo needed to they could write their own emulator dump their own copy of insert game here and move along just like before. But their is zero purpose in reinventing the wheel. So if it exists use it. That doesnt make them suddenly appreciative of the emulation scene since if Nintendo was the only one to distribute said game theyd wind up making a lot more money. ,emulation,dcq9rv9,1,t5_2qh6d

Minidiscs are pretty much the same as the full size discs. The only real difference is that some slot loader drives cant accept the mini discs and will jam. e.g. the Wii U drive cant accept GameCube discs but the Wii can. Discs that cant be dumped using standard PC drives are also often done using the same homebrew on a hacked console approach that cartridge systems use.Edit Happy cake day,emulation,ddqo03a,4,t5_2qh6d
10784238,0,t3_5u5xpk,PSP Preferably get the  model. It definitely got lots of love when it comes to emulation. PS native. Very good but incomplete compatibility. Retroarch decent for NESGBC. gPSP good GBA emulator. Runs full speed but has some bugs. SnesX actually supports exotic chips they run near full speed too. Remember to enable hardware rendering and set frameskip to auto. Some slowdown with Mode stuff. Has good standalone Megadrive and GBC emulators. Has proofofconcept N  DS  Saturn emulators but not recommended.Vita also has new emulators AND supports PSP ones.DS A mixed bag. Some would tell you to get the new DS but aside from a few exclusives a playable Hyrule Warriors Legends Xenoblade Chronicles Muso Fire Emblem a couple of Western indie games all available anyways on other platforms in much better versions and since Nintendo is phasing it out anyways in  years its more expensive and not worth it IMO. Rom injection injecting custom ROMs in Virtual Console emulators for NESMDGGGBC and SNESGBA but those last two are special.  SNES VC is exclusive to newDS but lacks support for games bigger than MB and anything with coprocessors. This makes  it on par with blargSNES DS and the SnesX port recently updated which are available for the oDS and have similar compatibility issues with SNES VC except some of those games are supported or worked on. GBA has mGBA but its slow on both oDS and nDS of course more on oDS but this is moot considering GBA VC relies on hardware retrocompatibility and hence runs all GBA games in full speed no connectivity sadly and of course no save states. Retroarch still poorly optimised. twloader replaced a port of desmume for DS. This makes use of the systems hardware retrocompatibility to play DS software without a flashcart. Virtual Boy the one logical emulator for the DS yet currently the project runs very slowly even on newDS and it seems dead in the water. emulators for the DS on flashcart surprisingly works out. DS definitely got more love compared to the DS.IMO best thing for emulation after PC is Android phones then PSP. I cant recommend a Vita in good conscience considering its library even with the emulation perks doesnt justify its cost. On Android the Retroarch port is competent though you might prefer standalone emulators for GBAPSPDSPSSaturnN. Drastic emulating the DS is even better than the available options on PC and PPSSPP is fantastic. You can emulate consoles up to the th console generation though no DreamCast and SaturnN may work but for a select few games and run slow. Theres no PS emulator though Play! may change that and the current Dolphin port is too much for the runofthemill Android phones.iOS phones have all kinds of limitations some affecting how a software may take advantage of the hardware so forget about that one. It does have emulators from the early consoles but its not the goto option.,emulation,ddsbder,9,t5_2qh6d

You use the version of the emulator you want and set it up however you want. The frontend should not impact the performance of the emulation itself though certain frontends may or may not run to your satisfaction.  There is a big difference between Retroarch and Launchbox. Retroarch is a UI for their cores where Launchbox is a frontend launher for any emulator or program you want to use. You can even use Retroarch through Launchbox but you will have to configure Retroarch on its own.,emulation,deu8uqh,1,t5_2qh6d

Your  LOC software now relies on an application that is at least MB in size already. In addition I wouldnt want developers try to fit everything in  LOC. Code should be efficient but forcing it to fit into  LOC would mean you cant solve a problem the way you intended to because you were focusing on keeping code as short as possible.In addition Node.jsElectron has hooks for key inputs why bother with AHK at all?

Either you can code it up in VerilogVHDL and then run it in a professional logic simulator or on an FPGA if you have one big enough. It would be accurate but slow.Or you can use MESSMAME. It seems uniquely suited for this kind of thing all the chips you talk about are already emulated in a cycle accurate way. I believe all you need to do is write a custom bus arbitration module I have no idea how you are planning to have the eight s interacting and then write a machine driver which pulls in every single component specifies a memory map and connects everything together.Then you compile it into MAME and run it. Should be able to run at full speed.,emulation,dgxiflq,9,t5_2qh6d
11807206,0,t3_68gpbc,PCSX is not cycle accurate and has a host of minor discrepancies from real hardware. But you have to remember that the PS is the point when console games started targeting the system as an abstract platform not a specific one. For example the very first japanese BIOS version has a bunch of bad bugs and there are hardware revisions that change subtle things about how the disk drive works.Loose hardware emulation is still OK for the PS as long as it emulates the abstract platform accurately enough to preserve everything that targeted that abstract platform. Thats not to say that its ideal but the system is complicated enough as it is that trying to emulate the hardware in a  accurate way is basically impossible. The N is basically the limit of that approach right now.As for PCSXs software renderer its very good and very fast. You can find some graphical bugs but the overwhelming majority of the time theyre caused by typos or caused by logic bugs in other parts of the system.,emulation,dgydyqw,31,t5_2qh6d
