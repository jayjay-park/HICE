On the Wiz side both Marcin Gortat and Trevor Ariza had  fouls. So guess what Mike Malone did? He attacked both Gortat and Ariza with DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay. And they had little resistance because they knew the guys guarding them had  fouls. On the flip side both Cousins and I. Thomas had  fouls. Wittman had the Wizards shooting jumpers instead of attacking. ,washingtonwizards,cg6h5qd,1,t5_2t1nv

I dont think he wants to sign here though neither does Lala Anthony.I mean this is all hypothetical anyway so I dont understand the exasperation at my response. I merely prefer KD to Melo and think hed be a better fit on the team. Im not playing a game where I get one for sure or maybe possibly a slight chance at another.Its not like if we can feasibly acquire Melo Im gonna be against that move. Thats ridiculous. Melo would be an excellent addition and hes a great player. I just like KD better in our system. In this hypothetical situation.I didnt say I want Brad and John hitting game winners but thatd be pretty dope. I just think it would be to their benefit to have trial by fire so to speak. Melo isnt gonna hurt them by being on the roster nor is he gonna stifle their development but I think letting Wall and Beal grow into leaders in those situations at a young age just benefits the core of this team longterm. This is all under the assumption that Wall and Beal will be here for awhile whereas Melo is probably gonna skip town after  years. Just my thoughts.

2643141,0,t3_2q7ea4,Is a reality check coming? In some ways yes. This team isnt a powerhouse like the Warriors or the Grizzlies. But I can tell you an easy schedule doesnt mean a thing over the course of an  game season. Sample sizes increase and what youll see is that good teams win a lot of games and bad teams lose a lot of games. One thing I can say is that the Wizards do play like a good team. Whether it seem this way or not there is a decent amount of parity in the NBA. The thing that separates a good team from a bad team is finishing out games and weve seen the Wizards do that to inferior opponents like the Bucks Twolves Jazz etc but weve also seen them close out games against good teams like the Cavs Clippers Heat etc. So what Ill say is yes the Wizards hot start May have something to do with the level of opponents theyre playing but there is no doubt in my mind that the Wiz are a top  level team in the East.

This article is putting such a retarded emphasis on the fact that he wont materialize as a player because of injuries. When we just dont know. Right now John and Beal are the only two things we have going for us and if we get rid of one it makes it easier for the other to walk away. Which puts us in the same fucking position we were six seven years ago. Fuck that Id rather gamble on Beal than gamble on what I dont even know that exists.,washingtonwizards,d0qa12v,6,t5_2t1nv

Ive shat on Ernie a lot for wasting a year of Johns prime by surrounding him with scrubs like Gary Neal but if KD signs here Ill gladly eat my words. Admittedly he probably wont though. Do you think Beal is going to be worth it in the long run or would you rather move him?This is a tricky subject as most Wizards fans think one of two things regarding Beal. Either A. He overcomes his injuries like Steph did and has a rises to allstardom or B. He becomes the second coming of Eric Gordon. Honestly it could go either way. Im very wary of giving him the max and hope that he gets a similar deal to Steph. What is Otto Porters ceiling?Not a star by any means but a reliable glueguy. Was the Markieff trade worth it?I think it was worth it as Markieff is better than any player we could snag with the pick based on how its likely to be in the midfirst round and he is on an absolute steal of a contract. Do you bring Nene back? I personally wouldntNenes likely to retire after this season but if he decides to keep playing Id take him back on a very reduced contract. Are you still happy with Wittman or was playoff Wittman an aberration? Randy needs to go. I like the guy as a person but its been obvious for a long time that playoff Wittman was a fluke and he is not the guy to take us to the next level.,washingtonwizards,d1vgr5j,8,t5_2t1nv

10875504,0,t1_de1pjxw,Listen youre making one very small mistake.gt this was also true before Lebron arrivedKyrie never played with a player as good as Gortat Beal or Porter before Lebron or Love got there.On a related note youre also making another larger mistake. Lets go back to the numbersPER is since you dont seem to understand the concept a perminute rating developed by ESPN.com columnist John Hollinger. In Johns words The PER sums up all a players positive accomplishments subtracts the negative accomplishments and returns a perminute rating of a players performance. As i said Kyrie has had a higher PER than Wall almost the entire time hes been in the league . career versus . career This would lead a smart person to conclude that Kyrie is a better player. I believe they are both very good and that Kyrie  COULD be considered better than Wall but its an argument not a fact. Once again I never said that Kyrie was better just that you could make the argument that he was because the numbers are there to back up said argument. ,washingtonwizards,de1qbii,1,t5_2t1nv

11529525,0,t1_dg2u5r2,The Bucks arent a defensive team... theyre ranked . Utah and Miami are both top  defenses as is Atlanta. You basically made my argument for me as to why Id rather face the Bucks. Their C presence is Greg Monroe the Hawks have Dwight Howard. If you watched our games vs the Bucks Wall carved them up with ease. The only way Milwaukee would beat us is by outscoring us Giannis would have to average like  . The Hawks can actually grind our offense down and make it a slugfest,washingtonwizards,dg2vglj,1,t5_2t1nv

11730492,0,t1_dgpo7e1,Completely agree. You know the refs heard Millsaps comments and they think they are being such good refs by stopping the MMA on the court. If Millsap gets the ball and  is guarding him there is gonna be a whistle blown and its gonna be like that for the rest of the series.,washingtonwizards,dgpojx1,25,t5_2t1nv
11736997,0,t3_67hi2q,Porter didnt have a bad game last night though. Only thing I would critique Otto for is not taking charge when he was the only starter on the court. Id love to see him being confident and driving to the lane instead he just throws the ball to Bojan who was missing everything in the first half. Morris and Gortat were trash though. We need to feed Gortat the ball in the paint a little more to get him going and hopefully draw some fouls on Howard and Millsap. Morris has just been terrible guarding Millsap and its not  percent his fault because Millsap is getting a lot of weak ass foul calls but Morris should be smart enough to not get into foul trouble two games in a row. I think Porter did a better job on the few plays he defended Millsap last night. I think we need to sub Morris out sooner and go with a Wall Beal Oubre Porter Gortat lineup mid way through the st quarter and let Morris carry the bench. I think Otto might be the best guy to cover Millsap until Mahinmi gets back. ,washingtonwizards,dgqf2nq,16,t5_2t1nv
