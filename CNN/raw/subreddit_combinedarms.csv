10443546,0,t3_5pkhag,Sounds like a decent rule. My one question though  would this apply to small armsattachmentsmedical supplies for them as well? For example if I ran out of ammo and the enemy is using the same type e.g. back in the Afghan War series am I allow to loot extra .MM from their bodies? Likewise what about medical supplies like morphine or bandages or epi?,combinedarms,dcruvxr,5,t5_3g4cb
