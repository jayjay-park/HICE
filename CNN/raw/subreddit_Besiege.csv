3046729,0,t3_2v1v7d, has worked pretty well for me so far although it does break after you shoot it. The key here is the double decouplers at the back. The first decoupler serves to disconnect itself from the main vehicle and is triggered by the same keys as the springs contracting the second decoupler separates the bolt from the first decoupler so its not held back and can fly into whatevers in its way.Its not exactly the pinnacle of destruction but it works well enough.,Besiege,codsjp6,6,t5_35zhe

You could always add another weightless block attached to the block that is under your unpowered wheel the block where the  rotors are on either side of it.

I have a Ulysse Nardin from the late s thats still going strong and accurate despite being shipped stored for a decade submerged knocked and examined by my notsocareful hands. That Chinese watch has been going strong for the last two years. My Rolex has also been going strong for almost  years now and that thing has literally been run over by a car.

Would it still work if a dozen other objects were modplaced at the exact symmetrically opposite position?Even seemingly simple tools can have a lot of underlying complexities to consider in actual implementation.I havent played KSP so perhaps they have already answered these questions.,Besiege,d6cemsb,3,t5_35zhe
