198550,0,t1_cf10bbf,Have you tried giving a video response or sending a tweet to him. This subreddit really isnt all that active. uNoerdy is really the only one posting ZipKrowd activity on this subreddit.,ZipKrowd,cf122hs,1,t5_2wlv7
316771,0,t1_cfdgcsa,So from above each other is fine and then have the towers be separated by  blocks from the center but not have them near the walls just closer to the inside.thank you.,ZipKrowd,cfdlp89,1,t5_2wlv7
338715,0,t1_cffuvd9,For the first issueThe server Im on is still running .. were waiting on a member to upgrade his PC so it can handle ..  I can take screenshots but I doubt theyd help in pinning the glitching down specifically because Ive made so many changes to the stream area by now trying to figure out what was causing the various odd behaviours .  In any event making sure that all nonsorting hoppers were covered by containers like furnaces resolved the missorting problems.  When I redo the streams with your new info in mind I can see if it also helps with the items that go missing which may be related to the previous missorting.For the second issueThank you so much for this information because with your description the behaviour I observed finally makes sense D.  Thinking that the items were passing over the hopper too quickly to get picked up Id tried placing regular blocks instead of ice either before or after the hoppers or both.  I was pretty confused when this produced the opposite effect to what Id predicted and the slower items got picked up less often instead of more.  But with a continual stream of items coming through from the witch farm it makes perfect sense.  The sorters got covered with random overfill items from witches and the longer they slowed down over the hoppers for the longer the hoppers were blocked from picking up the items they were keyed for.Given all of the twists and turns up there Id just been letting the item stream flow directly over the hopper faces instead of aligning them with ender chests to travel at ice speeds over the sorters.  Now that youve confirmed that I didnt misinterpret the results I saw I know that speed  accuracy so Ill be sure to find a way to fit in proper aligning.  Ill also look into adding a second sorter per silo maybe using a loop back around in the other direction.I should also consider changing my setup for item disposal.  Id been combining excess items with unsorted items in a final disposal queue chest at the end of the stream.  But if disposing of any excesses at their sorter position improves sorting accuracy of nonfull silos that may be worth taking another look at...Thanks again .,ZipKrowd,cffvmdj,1,t5_2wlv7

1271955,0,t1_cicphgt,I suggest the same honey comb pattern but more spaced out. I do not know the exact proportions of the one they used in the nether but I am sure a quick look at the video will help. ,ZipKrowd,cicpn78,1,t5_2wlv7
1566481,0,t1_cjcm9un,Yeah I figured that I would need to get the villagers in myself. Unless you want to make a diagramreplica showing what you mean by the  doors opposite the farm I think Ill just go with  doors. Wood is easy to get and if it works like this then I dont want to break it. Villager mechanics go way over my head so I dont want to waste time to have it not work.,ZipKrowd,cjcmr9x,1,t5_2wlv7
2650215,0,t1_cn4hd34,Dans is able to reset completely using redstone in case you place a door to close or the farm is unloaded.  The iron Titan is a build it once amp if it breaks have fun rebuilding it from scratch.,ZipKrowd,cn4iixe,3,t5_2wlv7
2709493,0,t1_cnc1vwt,Thanks.It seemed too good to be true so normally Id just disregard it but I was thrown off by the language I do not speak ,ZipKrowd,cnc242y,2,t5_2wlv7
2976353,0,t3_2u8yvt,In JLs most recent video of the Zipkrowd plot world the kid had developed one of the best slime block belt pushers Ive seen amp its A LOT less laggy than that design while also being bigger.,ZipKrowd,co6fe5e,1,t5_2wlv7
