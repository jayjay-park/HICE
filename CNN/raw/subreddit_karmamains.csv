5113414,0,t3_3l10h6,ADC Karma is just horrible Sivir. As such it will never be viable.Karmas autoattack scaling is nonexistent. There is no ad build which will make her scale as an attack damage character.To be an adc shed need two things to happen. AD scaling abilities. Even if its just her Inner Flame which had it.. Kennen Vayne Orianna level attack speed.Additionally shed need to gain  range or else be relegated to the realm of counterpicking very specific adcs.Alternatively she needs some sort of strange item which hasnt yet been created. Like an  AP item which transforms all of your damage to physical damage and uses your magic pen stat for your armor pen stat. Or something even wilder.Side note Honestly Im not sure why Riots afraid of giving Karma a higher base attack speed and better attack speed growth. IMO this is the thing which keeps Karma from having better offmeta builds and having decent early matchups against certain midlaners cough cough level  Orianna.Edit strikethrough doesnt work with this css. Just imagine Kennen amp Vayne are striken through,karmamains,cv2cvsn,2,t5_38fd9

7908896,0,t3_4nl80x,I dont really know why i started loving to play Karma i didnt even care for her until one night when i was browsing for supports to buy and she caught my attention. Ever since that night i just LOVE her shes not only cool looking but her kit is so fun to play too being able to boost your entire team with shields while still being able to do a lot of damage with you Q and having decent sustain with your empowered W. Shes a great champion.,karmamains,d4519ki,2,t5_38fd9

8921621,0,t3_527u6a,Atheneardent is the best build on TopMidSp karma right now. It is better if you just get rabadon instead of locket because the more ap you have. The stronger your shields are. just EOTW Athene Censor Boots Rabadon and Rylai or Void. ,karmamains,d7k8xz2,1,t5_38fd9

10417345,0,t1_dcooxu3,Tank Karma top and Karma support are completely different in build paths. The only thing supporty that I would build on Karma top would be Locket or ardent. Support Karma really shouldnt build spirit visage unless its last item against a full AP comp. And i saw this because its not really efficient to build it until then.,karmamains,dcovhe0,1,t5_38fd9
