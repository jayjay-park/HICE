4961808,0,t1_cujdeh9,If it is a  foot wide onelane dirt road I think it could be done in about an hour with the equipment of that time. You would just need really good organization. With a foot wide road you could squeeze two cars past each other but you probably wouldnt want to travel that way for long distances.A team of horses can plow .. acres of land per hour depending on the quality of the soil. That is about  square feet per hour. For a foot wide road that is something like  feet of road per hour. You have people following the horses and throwing any big roots and stones off the path. Then you have a horsedrawn grader come along and flatten down and compact the soil a little bit. You would worry about building the drainage ditches later.Edit Apparently there is an easier way to make a suitable road with one man two horses and one simple piece of equipment. ,whowillbuildtheroads,cujz3oo,2,t5_2wvp0
