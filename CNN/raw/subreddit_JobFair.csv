1366064,0,t1_cincq8t,Chemical engineering is a degree that is in need and will remain in need. Ive heard that there as been a surge in people going into STEM and its beginning to flood the market but from what Ive seen thats not true in Chem Engineering. Baby boomers are about to start retiring and theyll need their spaces filled. While this doesnt directly help someone in school now due to the experience needed for these roles it helps indirectly because people like myself who are already in the industry will move to fill the baby boomers roles vacating their current ones. My first piece of advice to would be to get an internship or coop and get it now. If it wasnt for that experience I would not have my job now. It doesnt matter if its in exactly what you want to be doing now just get the experience. I started off with a coop in a utilities company doing seasonal natural gas distribution planning. Wasnt much engineering involved. But that gave me professional experience it gave me the opportunity to work on project in that world and gave me some to reference in my job interviews which btw there were  of for my job. After that I got an internship with my current company networked there and now Im employed and busy spending my money on things that I shouldnt be. Start looking at companies like Dow BASF BP Marathon ExxonMobil Shell. They all have internship programs which could help you out a lot.My second piece of advice would be to not be afraid of moving around. You have to go where the jobs are. Sometimes itll be in a sucky area. Sometimes it wont. Sometimes youll find that it sounds like a shitty area but you actually love it. Hell I moved from Michigan to Louisiana and now Im in the NYC area. If you would have asked me before I started where I think Id have liked living the most Id certainly tell you NYC.  But now Ive found I dont like NYC and I prefer Baton Rouge much more. Next network network network. It honestly isnt about what you know. Its about who you know. Dont be afraid to play the game. One of my biggest challenges has been networking. I tend to talk about myself a lot. Dont do that. The conversation should be a give and take. Also dont approach a networking opportunity wondering what they can do for you. Approach it wondering what you can do for them. If your goals are purely selfish a lot of people will see right through that. My fourth piece of advice is more for when you have a job offer. Do not chase the money do the job that you think you will love. Because then it wont matter how much you make and  of the time you wont dread going into work. As a CHE youll be making anywhere from  to  starting. By any means any of those salaries are great. Ive avoided the petroleum industry for just that reason. They might pay me more than what Im making now but from what Ive heard theyre much more competitive theres more drama and back stabbing the company culture is about money not the people and the petroleum industry has a bad safety record compared to chemical industries.Also if youre looking at job listings be aware that a lot of companies have specific recruiting programs to fill entry level positions. Thats how my company works. They only have entry level positions through their university recruiting. And when you look also determines what youre going to see. Hiring runs in cycles especially for entry level. Youll probably see more entry level jobs around April or May when college graduates are beginning to enter the job market. But be on the lookout before that. For companies with programs you might want to look in SeptemberOctober. My companys program does interviews in that time frame so they took resumes and applications in August or so. Sorry for the length of this response. But my final thing to say is that dont be worried about what you see now. Chem engineers are in demand. Its a highly technical skillset that requires not only book smarts and the ability to think as well as be able to tackle many different problems. Theres a lot of people getting a degree in liberals arts. Not so many in CHE.,JobFair,cinixc5,3,t5_32ex8

This is still a core thing.The internet made this job a lot easier but opened up new possibilities also. Some of them are internet forums blog comments which can be very useful. It is just outragous how some people share sensitive information on the net. All the money and resources spent to protect sensitive information and some people just share in on the net. These places are not goldmines but can be very useful.An interesting example was during the Iraq war when one of the insurgent groups downloaded Facebook pictures of US soldiers on a base. The pictures had GPS coordinates. Based on that they mapped the whole base and as far as I remember they destroyed several Apaches with mortar fire.As this example shows OSINT became a powerful tool.And there are the large databases private companies sell about their users which can be datamined and used for a myriad of goals.What governments try to steal from each other? Anything and everything. The core job there can be others but this is usually the main responsibility of an intelligence organization is to provide information for decision makers so they can make the best decisions possible. The information can be anything based on the situation. ,JobFair,cino8ys,4,t5_32ex8

1588849,0,t1_cjffruc,Ok so my university actually doesnt have that major. Google tells me its similar to IO Psychology which many people from this major go into Human Resources so Ill go off of that a little. With Human Resources and IO Psychology a main factor is your leadership ability and your sales style. Sales style is a bit of an iffy way to put it though. Through college and beyond you will be put in charge of groups or simply in groups as a member. It is important that when looking into positions such as HR that you are capable of being both a leader and a follower. You need to have demonstrated through previous employment clubs activities etc. that you are able to delegate to a team and get to a common goal as well as listen to a leader to get to said goal. Many employers may look to ask about situations in which you either led a team successfully or failed to lead a team successfully keep in mind that ifwhen an interviewer asks you to evaluate your own failure at a task they dont care about the failure but about what steps you took to learn from it and grow for the future. They need to know that you make mistakes. Once. Afterwards they need to know you learn from them and teach others to do the same. As a Recruiter you need to be able to sell two things Your organization military company university etc and your target. You sell your organization by being eloquent and articulate. If you can describe your company in a way that will attract my attention then that will make you more qualified for the position than someone who needs to read off a script. You need to be commanding attention and making people want to join your cause. You sell your target because it doesnt matter if your company is the best in the world if I dont think I deserve to be there...I wont try. You need to be able to learn quickly about your target and about what they can bring to the company and sell them their own potential. If during a short conversation I can learn which University you attended clubs you participated in hobbies classes youve taken among other things then I can follow making sure you know how your classes have prepared you for our demands and how your hobbies and university values reflect our companys mission statement. Its all about delivery.If you can sell yourself and sell others well enough on what you want they will buy into it. If you can demonstrate the skills necessary in a manner that others either cant describe or cant deliver then you are a better candidate for a job.Edit Excuse the lenght.TLDR Sell yourself sell your target. Be eloquent friendly articulate and be able to do your job better than the next person even if you dont know the next persons qualifications.,JobFair,cjfg207,1,t5_32ex8

For your spec script pick your favorite show and write your very own episode of it.  Make sure you pick a show thats popularestablished enough that someone who reads it will be familiar with it.  A good rule of thumb is to pick a show thats currently on the air in its third season or more.    Your pilot script is just that  your very own TV pilot!  More and more agents would rather read an original pilot than a spec so its a good idea to have one.    This goes for all aspects of writing.  Your portfolio is your resume.  If you want to be an advertising copywriter then write copy for your favorite products.    If youre a novelist or short story writer then good news!

6141515,0,t3_3znyqf,In terms of further postsecondaryLibrary sciences are a mixed bag. Its a lot of work and often extra moneydebt to take on for a job that doesnt pay particularly well and doesnt necessarily have the wealth of opportunities one hopes for once theyve graduated with a big ol MLS behind their name. Forbes put it as one of the third worst masters degrees you can get with a midcareer salary at around k. Its not a terrible salary generally but it kind of is for somebody who spent  years at college. Its a lot of input for not a fantastic output.I went to the University of Toronto and was a part of the iSchool which is museum archives libraries and information sciences. Its tough in a lot of ways and I think one of the clear patterns at the school is that students who specialize in the INFORMATION SCIENCES part of the degree are the most likely to succeed postgrad. The technological skills they earn and sharpen over the course of the degree is what makes them the most valuable and employable  its about having the right combination of skills really. They do fine.The other kids do not necessarily. The Library kids is more of a mixed bag. For every success story there are failures.One of the important things to know going into the degree though is what career path you want to take afterwards. Having some clue about what application that degree will have for you is important. Itll guide which internships and coops you do itll dictate which courses you want to take which stream of MLIS youll chose etc.Another factor in students success was having previous experience. People who came in with a few years working experience were more likely to find infield and wellpaying positions postgraduation. Kids who came straight from undergrad degrees with little experience in the working world? More of an uphill battle. MLIS degrees tend to be a bit of a delayedmasters degree. Academics tend to stream from one degree into the next but its a professional degree so you get a lot of people looking to further their career by getting relevant experience in the field theyre already active in. Most of my colleagues were in their midlate s and older and most had some relevant work experience in our chosen field.There are tons of other options too by the way. I graduated in Art History and friends of mine have gone on to a number of different paths including law publishing with textbook companies public relations working for advertising companies as account execs investment banking on yonge street paralegals recruiting for tech and oil companies teaching english in South Korea et. al.

Well I ended up staying in my hometown and still couldnt find anything. I was working extremely part time for a paintampwine company but needed a FT job. My bosss best friend worked for a temptohire firm and suggested I come in for an aptitude test and they would be able to find me something. At first I was given a customer service rep gig really a secretary. Months go by and my boss was a dickhead with no concern for employee safety and would bully the employees. So I went back and asked for another assignment and ended up getting an admin job for a local nonprofit. Months go by we get picked up by an association mgmt company and they saw how amazing I was at getting people to events and creating themes for everything.  So they offered me a promotion to be their design marketing person. After yr out Im finally working in my preferred area with a great boss and great pay. My advice is to go to a temp agency and by working hard and showing what youre good at eventually youll be where you want to be.

10540222,0,t1_dd2ukti,I did as much research as I could found the guy on linkedin and Facebook and did some facetime with him its the same guy. It all seems legit and he hasnt requested anything of me yet that would be suspicious. He also seemed to be in the know about the QA process so if its a scam its pretty dang elaborate.Im still wary but Ill go a long and hope for the best.,JobFair,dd2unkn,3,t5_32ex8
