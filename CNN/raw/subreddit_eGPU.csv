7602655,0,t1_d35y3i2,Ok and youre still having issues? Everything seems set up properly and its not like you have a bad cpu. Im using an i q I think. ,eGPU,d36dse8,2,t5_2ukno
7625583,0,t1_d38z3mb,Ok understood. Let me know after you do the one or two things I mentioned. Well try out best to figure this out,eGPU,d38zkrj,1,t5_2ukno
8391854,0,t1_d5qiteo,If you want to be  sure measure the width of the card.M. is mm miniCard is wider.An M. slot would be better as it has the potential to be a x or x link instead of just an x link. But I dont know if adapters like the EXP GDC Beast can leverage that. You need to look at the physical port anyway to determine which notches it has there are differences. ,eGPU,d5qj23z,1,t5_2ukno
8637885,0,t1_d6kv5zr,You can still use the TB port of the XPS  to connect an external GPU though but like others have said youd have to wait for competitors like the PowerColor Devil Box or the Gigabyte GPTGFx to bring the price down.,eGPU,d6lce0f,1,t5_2ukno
8724019,0,t1_d6vro4w,They could easily sell so much more if they didnt use their proprietary cable. The only other egpu on the market really is the razer core thats like ,eGPU,d6w56qh,1,t5_2ukno
8901524,0,t3_525mbw,I dont actually have much experience with this so if Im wrong somebody please point it out but I think thats for delaying the startup of the card to avoid issues when booting.,eGPU,d7hu32l,2,t5_2ukno
9770049,0,t1_dahba94,Do you reccomend the GDC beast per your thread?,eGPU,dahdhvm,1,t5_2ukno
9829598,0,t1_daogmgi,There is a lot of mud flying back and forth. I noticed T|I is offering Setup. for free now with the claim that it is free software. I wonder how ugly this is going to get.,eGPU,daotgrx,1,t5_2ukno
9988671,0,t1_db9jgd2,So I saw lots of complaints of poor customer services and linked to them. Legit or not their online customer service record according to the site previously linked does not look great. I would say avoid. ,eGPU,db9jv2d,1,t5_2ukno
10058189,0,t3_5jpf2x,Bravo! Bravo I say!,eGPU,dbilu98,2,t5_2ukno
10095332,0,t3_5kexaf,Neat and easy eGPU implementation there. Would you mind including CUDAZ bandwidth results with your rig? It wil confirm if you are really getting GbpsTB bandwidth between your system and your video card. Weve see several underperforming TB machines,eGPU,dbnfqia,1,t5_2ukno
10178713,0,t3_5ko0bs,gtBlack Ops  for example gets a  FPS boost when running in windowed modeIf you fullscreen a game it give the game somewhat exclusive control over your graphics card until you AltTab or exit the game. Youll always take a performance hit if you play games windowed.If youre running your eGPU over Thunderbolt I dont know where your issues are comming from but if youre using ExpressCard or mPCIe you need to get an external display. Theres not enough bandwidth on a x PCIe lane for driving an internal display.,eGPU,dbxtagz,1,t5_2ukno
10201554,0,t1_dbwp5c0,Okay I finally got it working. Its a little different than the Razer Core I tried to install the nvidia drivers without a monitor plugged into the gpu and so it kept giving a BSOD. Then I dug up a monitor and plugged it into the GPU and it started working properly. Even when I disabled other display drivers without a monitor plugged in it wouldnt used the Egpu. You really need an external monitor to use this Box,eGPU,dc0eisf,1,t5_2ukno
10238465,0,t1_dc0pm2i,I think the thunderbolt  port in the xps  is bottlenecked to gbps thunderbolt  speeds. Check out the list of working egpu setups in the www.egpu.io forum.,eGPU,dc4l5fr,2,t5_2ukno
10259598,0,t1_dc5fmie,To further clarify your question the p output of the beast is directly connected to the p input. Theres no need to use it when powering the beast with an ATX supply. Its really only useful when powering the beast with a Dell DA and using a card that requires external power.,eGPU,dc6zcjp,1,t5_2ukno
10448212,0,t1_dcqiybd,The connection cable goes to the pcie so its recognized as a data device. The Devil Box comes with a power cable for the sata ssd but you need a separate cable to actually connect it to the guts of the enclosure. They really couldve included a  cable as well It can connect one sata  ssd or hdd ,eGPU,dcse9wr,1,t5_2ukno
10548445,0,t1_dd3oq7s,I dont want an atx psu because of its large size. Do you know of something similair to the Dell da but with more power? It would be perfect because of its size and no fan noise.,eGPU,dd3s8st,1,t5_2ukno
10578690,0,t1_dd73bde,Yeah the only problems I have encountered with eGPU areWaiting for window to detect the GPU seriously it took many restart just to do thatNot pluging the power cord properly Ok this one is all my faultand finally update the driver to a stable version.Oh and absolutely dont close the lid. I dont know what the problem is but the system start buzzing and I thought that I fried either the GPU or the laptop.Hope that help D,eGPU,dd73ygf,2,t5_2ukno
10682655,0,t3_5su4xx,Your laptop lacks Thunderbolt so that option is out. Does your laptop have a bottom access panel that is easy to open? If so open it carefully and snap a picture of the insides high resolution if possible. The manual is really terse on the internal connections you got available.,eGPU,ddhu2m2,2,t5_2ukno
10791700,0,t1_ddt20ch,shoot i really wanted it to work as a dock as well. them usbs and ethernet.,eGPU,ddt35yf,1,t5_2ukno
10812153,0,t3_5ui7x4,Have you checked whether you can use the USB ports and ethernet? Im sure youre aware of how lucky you are to have a devilbox where the GPU works with a Dell XPS... The harddisk is internally wired on a USB to SATA bridge so if you cant use the USB ports you cant use the harddisk.,eGPU,ddv7409,2,t5_2ukno
11018173,0,t1_degupah,It recognized it as TUL devil box just didnt recognize the gpu.Not sure if the firmware once I get home at  I can tell youMore. I did that right before I went to work. Also there was no error  at all it worked out of the box.How do I check the firmware?,eGPU,degvnym,1,t5_2ukno
11127524,0,t1_det8by3,Taobao. Look at my previous post  there is a link. ,eGPU,detan7d,1,t5_2ukno

11261187,0,t1_df8f3ug,It works without any modifications software tweaks or anything like that. I booted into Windows installed the drivers for my video card rebooted and that was that. ,eGPU,df8ft66,1,t5_2ukno
11388099,0,t1_dfmf7l7,wait do I need to have something attached to the GPU for it to be recognized?,eGPU,dfmtlt2,1,t5_2ukno

11553882,0,t1_dg56ubw,Good to hear I was going to ask the same question....,eGPU,dg5mwwv,1,t5_2ukno
11573154,0,t1_dg7qzv1,A factory overclock should not be an issue since the card is still required to be in spec. When you start unhinging things by yourself you can end up overloading something. I run the Gigabyte Ti OC and it works just fine in the Thunder for a long time now. The EVGA should also be fine. I suggest you flip the Thunders fan around. It is an intake by default but it works better as an exhaust.,eGPU,dg7tn1s,1,t5_2ukno
11697217,0,t3_66wj68,Take a look at what people are actually using with the Node Theres a couple of GTXs there.In general pretty much everything should work though. So any GTX should work with no issues barring faulty components.,eGPU,dglwc8k,1,t5_2ukno
11697709,0,t3_66wv0c,Shit. Should I cancel my thunder  order and wait for this? I wonder when its going to be available for purchase,eGPU,dglyci5,1,t5_2ukno
11699169,0,t1_dgm42a9,No I just meant the normal BIOS.Weird I thought the certification problem was only on enclosures with newer Controllers and not also on host devices.,eGPU,dgm4b5c,1,t5_2ukno
11746684,0,t3_67g1n1,Thanks for this post I have the i version of the  macbook pro w tb. And I was thinking the same thing becuase in Heroes of the Storm I most of the times get a CPU warning and FPS drop to low s. But its weird because i check the cpu load and its around . Anyways thanks for the answers here I also had in mind a  with  an Akitio Node.,eGPU,dgrilir,1,t5_2ukno
