So Im moving and I plan on getting back to the lifestyle that I want complete with regular gym trips and socializing.,single,d2xosjo,1,t5_2riz2

10722015,0,t3_5rb2le,As a single guy who gets shy easily around good looking girls but ended up being with someone around a lvl  or  Im single now but ya... yes...its intimidating to walk up to a girl and say hi on a normal day let alone if shes almost model quality with brains.So you get aprouched by drunk men or cocky men who dont want relationships because the guys who would are looking at you like Wow that women is incredible! How do I even speak with someone like her?! Shes breath taking!Im  and single and this is why Im single. Im so polite around good looking girls that Im mistaken as a boring uninterested pussy. Even if thats not true Im just shy. Im a computer geek that has the mentality of a goth or skater.And some of the girls that get to know me become too intimidated by me..So yes youre so amazing its scary.,single,ddlwaad,1,t5_2riz2
