2197197,0,t3_2k86iz,Whats the issue? You said its still saying it did you buy it or did you think its included in the Day One edition its not. Did it bring you to the Season Pass page? You dont have to downloadbuy it its just showing you that a season pass is available since you now own the game. ,sunsetoverdrive,clj49cj,1,t5_2xilm

2231059,0,t1_clncwl9,Hmm not sure. I guess just remember landmarks like in front of the museum near the basket ball court. I think theyre supposed to be replayable even after gold because it compares scores with your friends list. ,sunsetoverdrive,clnf5sx,1,t5_2xilm

2255693,0,t3_2l0ugd,Heres a video of me doing it. I have the bounce splosion epic on which helps if the OD get close to you it also does give points. Basically keep going for multi kills and kill streaks and when theyre in straight line mow them down. When the spawn they are at starts to die down move to another spawn so you can attempt to get a multi kill. It is very tricky but in time youll get itEdit dont know why theres no sound but its not that necessary ,sunsetoverdrive,clqixaz,2,t5_2xilm

2335853,0,t3_2m0v4t,I believe these should pop eventually. Sounds like it is on the MS side of things. We are reaching out to them to make sure. I played last night and had two achievements not pop as well even though they are . ,sunsetoverdrive,cm0fa3c,1,t5_2xilm

2520833,0,t1_cmnlpbw,my game plan next time is to try to go all in on stalling rager freeze bomb plague bringer decoy everything I can so that I can stem the tide and let my teammates bring the pain.  But often you get teams that dont even pass a lot of the initial challenges and thats just a nightmare because youve bumped up the chaos and gotten nothing of value in return.,sunsetoverdrive,cmnm035,2,t5_2xilm

3577716,0,t3_314xzd,I just finished it and it pretty short but it had without a doubt the best final boss Ive seen. But I agree with uspaceboykevin that you should probably wait till its on sale. It had some nice content in it but overall not to much content. ,sunsetoverdrive,cq03661,1,t5_2xilm
