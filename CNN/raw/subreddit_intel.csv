6122011,0,t3_3zetv6,Well I wouldnt count the stock heatsinkfan as a pro first of all because I wouldnt recommend using it for any kind of real overclocking.Whether or not its worth it is hard to say. BLCK overclocking is quite a bit different than overclocking using multiplier. When you overclock with the BLCK you lose the ability to see what temperature your CPU is running at.  At least thats what currently happens on these z bios updates for BLCK overclocking. Any temperature monitoring program will tell you that your cpu is at c all the time. Another downside is that it tends to slightly slow your ram speeds down. Then you have to deal with the fact that its not technically meant for overclocking so Im sure that intel will not cover it under warranty if something goes wrong.Of course the advantages of all that performance for less money is very attractive. It all comes down to what is personally worth it to you.For me it is. I bought an i for my build Im doing this week and Im looking to try to reach around .Ghz on it.,intel,cylic03,2,t5_2rm1b

7761953,0,t1_d3nyw1p,This is the correct answer.You could also maybe try    . It will then run ghz and boost to .ghz and possibly higher when actually active. Your regular multiplier should always be less than your lowest turbo multiplier. What yours is basically doing is staying at ghz then applying turbo voltage without the accompanying speed boost. Im not sure why auto is doing what it is doing. Maybe Intel changed things for the newer Cpus. I think typically it is   core active is  over base multiplier.   cores active is  over base multiplier   or  cores active is  over base multiplier. Note If you have disabled core parking in Windows it will be extremely rare for the cpu to enter the   or even  cores active turbo mode since all cores will almost always be active. And since your  cores active multiplier is  you will never get higher than ghz. ,intel,d3oh23w,2,t5_2rm1b

There is everything wrong with the TIM of SkylakeQuote from AnandTech  Skylake CPU Package AnalysisgtTo paraphrase Splave again he comments that the thermal paste TIMo n his Skylake is certainly worse than that of Devils Canyon. If the extra mass on the IHS is coming from a taller heatspreader by virtue of the smaller package substrate then more TIM is needed otherwise there will be substantial air bubbling of the TIM between the CPU and the heatspreader. By replacing his own thermal paste and resecuring the heatspreader he saw an C drop in temperatures at his highest air overclock with the old paste . GHz at . volts  from C that overheated to C on the warmest core. An C drop is immense. Under those conditions and based on rough testing not published in our Skylake review it could equal another  MHz depending on the quality of the processor. PCWatch confirms that switching out the paste with CoolLaboratorys Liquid Pro a liquid metal adhesion interface reduced temperatures at .

If YOU see past it then all well and good but the facts are  the highlyupvoted post on this very subreddit where people are comparing a  cpu to an AMD system build as if that cpu is what a gamers system build would be  headline after headline cites the  figure being undercut and the R performing better in gaming then that CPU. That is the meme or the crux of the story people seem to be coming away with  AMD sowed the seeds of that meme themselves. When you say I misunderstood Im wondering if youre aware of the context that made me want to write this.My intention is push back against what I see as misinformation.

They could still offer  quadcore CPUs with a  core CPU sitting right next to it on the shelf.Playing around with their socket options doesnt necessarily mean the destruction of HEDT vs mainstream.Im not saying they are doing that Im not saying for certain that is their objective but I am saying that this core KabyLakeX on X is certainly the first step towards blurring the lines.If they test the waters here today and if they find success  or  years from now they might just offer everything on the same socket. This could be a first step in that direction but we need to watch how it slowly plays out.There is nothing binding Intel to eternally offer  sockets with one being highend. They do it currently for efficiency reasons based upon the way their CPUs are manufactured and SKUs that are derived from cut server chips.There was a time in history where the X platform didnt even exist as a consumer HEDT the way we currently know it.,intel,dgr3fl1,2,t5_2rm1b
