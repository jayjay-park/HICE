1412838,0,t3_2aa1yu,I use this camera ArmFlailingTubeMan beings up the point it is useless to have above  TVL. I think it adds more detail and has a higher possible sharpness to the image being transmitted. Whether  TVL makes a difference or not I dont think it matters that much. Its more about what sensor the camera uses. The PZ and Effio p and Effio e sensors are all great. Ive never used a Nextchip sensor but its probably fine also. For the same price Ill take the higher TVL camera. Stick with CCD. CMOS has a rolling shutter processes top down creating a rolling jelloy image. CCD captures the whole frame all at once and solve this problem. I really dont feel its worth it to buy a camera thats over  when others are just as great. ,fpv,citdmns,1,t5_2tb4x

1708047,0,t1_cjqaalf,MultiWii doesnt disarm during failsafe until the very end of the countdown timer when it turns off the motors.  If the FC gets RX signals back before that it should immediately come out of failsafe.    Once the countdown timer reaches zero it powers off the motors disarm and sets f.OKAYTOARM to false  so you cant rearm it without first doing the disarm sequence first.  This is just to prevent accidents if you get back within range after a failsafe.     If ONLYARMWHENFLAT is defined in config.h the aircraft has to be level and stationary to arm.     So in summary you should have been able to regain control as soon as the aircraft received a signal again up until the FAILSAFEOFFDELAY timer reaches zero and the motors disarm.   If you turn off ONLYARMWHENFLAT then you could even rearm it after the failsafe countdown disarm but while it was still falling by sending the DISARM ARM sequence again.     This is all assuming that the problem is really that you flew above radio range.  If what actually happened is that your RX malfunctioned then obviously nothing will work.  Or if for some reason that RX wont reestablish link after going out of range then that could cause this problem too.   Ive flown above range with a DSM TXRX combo dropped into failsafe and then recovered seconds later when the quad descended back into radio range and the RX reestablished link.  It was hairraising but recoverable and a lot lower than this since I was using DSM.    So Im curious to know why you couldnt reestablish control.,fpv,cjuglw8,1,t5_2tb4x

2026636,0,t1_ckx8c1b,Usually I would just cut a rectangle out in fron of the spars in the nose of the aircraft for a battery. I would take the piece I cut out and re attach it with a tape hinge and then tape it shut during flight.Keeping the hatch shut with tape was messy and less safe. Plus it was hard to keep the battery in one place inside the plane.The solution was to cut of a little of the nose and use a tape hinge to make a flap out of some of the material I used. I put some foam on the other three sides of the battery to keep it i  place. Now it is really easy to switch batteries and fly again.The rubber band you see is actually one large one wrapped through the hingeline ,fpv,ckxffpi,2,t5_2tb4x
2036418,0,t3_2i3fhp, mile of range is quite a long way for a little  quad btw. These things are more designed for ripping around near by trees and obstacles. To make it out that far and back means pretty much flying in a straight line for a mile turning around and heading back and with the small battery used in  size quad you may or may not make it.. This sort of flying is typically done by larger quads. FPV system depends on your budget. If you can afford it ish  just grab the fatshark Attitude V setup goggles. They come with all you need  The video receiver is built into the goggles so it makes for a very minimal and clean setup and the goggles are very high quality.

Now I need a camera synchronised with oculus rift head tracking and some asg guns and sensor surfaces to detect hits and I am making a fantastic aviation game! After all I am a gamedev.

4092593,0,t3_37hqs8,Heres some important info for you guys.The system specs are as follows Fatshark Dominator Goggles NexWave RF .VRx This camVTx setupThe goggles work fine from my experience. Ive used them with an external groundstation . system before and have never had any problems with them.The camera and VTx are transmitting fine. They were on for a while before turning the goggles on and displayed an image fine on the goggles for the short while you can see.  N.B. The image from the goggles is not washed out and hard to see in person the camera just doesnt pick it up well so thats not the issue!These things lead me to believe that the issue must be with the VRx. Its brand new but its the only part of the system that hasnt been shown to work fine so my guess is that it is DOA. It seems like its overheating or something perhaps because the video works for a few seconds before dying after you turn it on.What do you guys think?If you need any additional info pictures or video to clarify whats going on just give me a shout!.UPDATEAfter some more testing Ive concluded the problem is actually with the goggles themselves. I tested with system without the VRx installed and still got the screen fade. Still not sure what is causing the problem though.,fpv,crms48o,1,t5_2tb4x

5349813,0,t1_cvum2yr,Hey there i always took well to LOS flying long before FPV was around. I suppose from playing Microsoft Flight simulator when i was little early s in rd person view.  So when i got my first RC plane it was natural my take offs and landings were already proficient even though i only had gaming experience.I have never tried an autoland and my controller doesnt support it anyhow Cyclops Tornado. Also my absolute favourite part of aviation is the landings and approaches and such. I really like to be in full control and plan my landings well.I have never met anyone who had a problem with me flying. Most of the places i fly have no foot traffic walking by nor are there any houses immediately nearby although i may graze a property or two just depending on the scenario but usually high enough that they wouldnt notice. Plus my airplanes are quiet.The general public are much more proairplane than they are prodrone. A fixed wing plane cant hover above them or look at them for a long period of time and make them nervous. They see airplanes and just think wow cool!.  So i benched my quadcopters for now and have been enjoying the freedom of flying and sharing it with people.When looking for a new place to fly i have many options because i am comfortable landing and taking off in close proximity to obstacles poles power lines etc. So i usually look for somewhere that has at least one direction that i can fly without flying over busy roads or urban areas.    The better you get at landings and takeoffs the easier it is to just roll up to a new spot and say I got this no problem.Enjoi,fpv,cvvhyp1,1,t5_2tb4x

In the playback monitor it would look fine but once I exported the rendered video would play back at incorrect rates. So if I was doing a voiceover or a pictureinpicture they would get out of sync. This was frustrating enough to make me try out the day trial of Premiere and... wow. It is so good. It is just so good. Everything you want to do is just easy and works. I mean dont get me wrong its a complicated program because video editing is complicated but it is absolutely as easy to use as it could possibly be.

I ran the elevator servo down the side through the hatch using a servo extension.One thing to be careful is the vtx airflow I originally had a mw mini vtx in it but that fried on the ground.  I used a jst connector and a servo wire so I can change vtx easily thankfully.

6550440,0,t1_czwq5gz,Having worked with the higher end HD video systems on commercial shoots and been heavily involved in research in a rather applicable field Ive got a reasonable idea of the issues involved.Its actually pretty good regarding intraframe degradation the trick with racing style use would be to drop from  p to something like p at a lower frame rate. The bitrate increases and just provides extra error correction.Weve had our full sized craft doing upwards of a hundred kmh with reasonably complex movements and occlusions and held a perfect  stream over .km range. They really are that great the only issue is that system video link HD field monitor sundries is worth about  grand without camera.I would put one on my  to try but I cant afford one for what is essentially a toy.

8980465,0,t3_539cy7,If you have had any experience with FPV you may find that with average . systems the multipathing that happens with the water makes it difficult to get a clean signal.  You may want to consider going with a .ghz system with extremely high quality circularly polarized antennas like those by Video Aerial systems  Youll want to find a polarized antenna with as high an axial ratio as you can get.  A good polarized receiver will help cut down on the multipathing of the signal by the water. If you ignore all this and try to run a standard . with the whip antenna it came with please make sure youve got a spotter or two and preferably someone with an RC boat that can help fish the plane out of the water. ,fpv,d7rbcey,2,t5_2tb4x

10098593,0,t3_5kfzi7,As an owner of the full size SH and several other foam planes EPP is a far superior material for planes in almost every aspect. That said if you need a lil more payload I would go with the micro however I dont think the benefit of extra payload outweighs the durability gain you get with the nano. I personally like my full size SH because it just flies no matter how heavy it is although like a pig and EPO isnt a big deal because  crash and the frame is the least of my worries.,fpv,dbnv046,2,t5_2tb4x
