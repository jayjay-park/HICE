At  GB youre probably approaching diminishing returns on this rule  so again it depends on what youre doing with your laptop.If youre doing computation so intensive that you notice performance differences between PC and PC are you doing large operations in Matlab? then youre probably better off utilizing a system built for performance anyways.,hardware,cerpkpp,3,t5_2qh18

120408,0,t3_1vfuzt,Its going to be hard to argue architectural stuff. The x ISA just says given these inputs produce these outputs. How you do it is part of implementation. The other part of the trick is that the CPU continues to hoard more and more of the system that used to be part of the motherboard onto itself. Uncore is a massive part of the chip now.The real advantage Intel have had since AMD spun off their fabs and going forward is that they have superior silicon fabrication tech and the money to keep developing it.Wrapping all that together there is real benefit to having control of the entire development process.AMD used to or still might have some leverage in datacenter space where the performance metric is based on performancewatt. However at this point the new Xeons are just packing more cores every generation and virtualization being the name of the game that is a welcome sight. At least in the industrial services sector I dont see any AMD stuff being used. At this point It is more likely to be a tug of war between Intel and ARM than Intel and AMD there.,hardware,ces549r,1,t5_2qh18

Theyre a generation behind basically and Intel has no signs of slowing down... However when it comes to the GPU front AMD is leagues ahead and rowing neck and neck with Nvidia and possibly pulling ahead with the Xbox One and PS while Intel is barely dipping their toe in the water.AMD intends to leverage this with HSA and Mantle to fight Intel and Nvidia on two fronts respectively and its definitely worth watching for.,hardware,cesrcyu,1,t5_2qh18

Ive only played one game that doesnt have crossfire support AC but it would still run like shit because that game has the CPU optimization of a game from .Though I have to say that AMDs drivers are pretty crap. Since the frame pacing drivers have come out theres a bug where GPU will run at  creating a lot of fan noise if the GPU is being used at all. Its an issue with Ultra Low Power State where the GPU is either in ULPS or running full throttle. Its able to be fixed if you turn off ULPS in your registry so that GPU  will never enter ULPS then it will correctly report its usage. Theres also a bug that will cause the master GPU to switch rapidly between idle and D clock speeds when doing anything like browsing the internet causing the screen to flicker a lot. It can be fixed also by creating a custom profile so that the GPUs will never go down to idle clocks. While the two biggest bugs I can think of are really annoying but easily fixed however I shouldnt have to edit my fucking registry to avoid a huge bug thats been in AMDs drivers for months. Or prevent my GPUs from idling so I dont have an epileptic seizure induce my my screen going into rave mode.TLDR crossfire performance is great drivers are garbage. ,hardware,cf1ugd5,3,t5_2qh18

Basically the average consumer wont be able to tell a difference really between the two. The only exception here would be if computing power stagnated.Of course Im not going to predict when that would happen and it will of course happen first for cartoon like movies. But its funny to even compare the Geforce  demo to the actual Final Fantasy movie which I think only about now  years later are we really able to do that level of detail in realtime although there still might be some odd limits like physics.Movie trailer   GeForce  I mean calling it movie quality is for sure a disservice but kind of interesting to see and I am impressed with the hair.

1299241,0,t1_ciel229,Well theres fsqrt on x.  But I get your point  the highlevel implementation of an operation could ask the CPU to do more work than a lowlevel one.  Generally I think the dependencyanalysis in modern cisc cpus prevents unnecessary uops from blocking other uops which helps mitigate the problem.The issue with an optimizing compiler is that it has to compile for a family of CPUs  not just Nehalem or Ivy Bridge.  Its got to produce pretty good code that works well on many implementations of the instruction set.  So if you let the final stage of optimization occur in the CPU itself  by letting it implement high level instructions  you can get good performance on a family of CPUs from a single binary.,hardware,cifs50l,1,t5_2qh18

Any reasonable person who is NOT tryign to be a douche can discern what I meant. AND even if they could not. Any reasonable person would ask.  You are just being an asshole.  Now would you like to stop picking my comment apart and debate the original topic? Which I might add you have still not provided a proper retort.  In a sense video cards have always been capable of p and k in a sense they have not and will not be p and k capable.  Now I know what i just typed on the surface may seem like it has some holes in it... But you will make note of my use of the Phrase In a sense. So clearly there is more to this statement.  Did I say Video cards have always been capable of k.? No i did not.  I said In a sense they have always been capable.  You will also make note of the word Capable  Well if you look at a spec sheet clearly manyall of them up to a point were not capable of k.  Well that is once again covered by my use of the phrase In a sense   If you can see what I mean by that then please respond. If you cannot then I have failed in my delivery. Or achieved in raising a debate. And simply ask me to clarify.  UnkemptLaw Why Ori my good man what on Gods green earth do you mean? Are you saying my Diamond Viper with Mb of RAM and only a VGA port could produce k?  Origosis Well not exactly. Clearly it could not due to the limitations of the VGA and the MB of RAM. But had we had a use for k I think it could have.. Granted I am going far out on a limb here.... Ok hear me out....   Lets say that somehow  x  resolution was the standard. God only knows how but let us assume... We would either have had dual VGA ports to deliver the picture or maybe we would have a lower refresh I dunno for the most part we are going to ignore the Pipe and the display. We will assume they exist somehow. We are worried about the question of If a video card in  could do k. So how does it display with only MB of RAM?  Ok here is how that might work.   x    pixels   x    bits       bytes       kilobytes      .MB  So as we see here we could only do a color depth of bits.  So if k was and stayed a standard in  then we would see that it would have taken a little bit longer to progress to a bit color depth and higher refresh rates.  So as you can see we have technically always been capable of k. i could technically run any game on my PC at k right now... granted I might need to force it in the config and drop the settings to low. But jad k already been a standard. the setting would have existed and video card development would have come along slightly differently. ,hardware,cinqdic,0,t5_2qh18

Disk arrays with dedicated parity drives are confined to RAID and RAID I dont know of too many systems that actually use or even implement these RAID levels.What this guy is saying isnt really that new There have been large studies done on hard drives that show that they fail in one of two modes early life initial deployment or late life years later. When you deploy a RAID array you often install drives all of the same age so in the event that one drive fails due to being in the late life failure zone the likely hood that other drives will also fail when you start taxing them due to drive rebuilds  heavier than usual access patterns is high.What is more problematic is that drive interface technology has not kept pace with the size of drives. When SATA first came out there were drives over GB. As it stands right now with TB drives we have a  increase in storage space per drive with no real difference in the connection speed to that same drive. To put that into perspective imagine drinking a standard glass of water oz through a straw. Now imagine using that same straw to drink an entire bathtub full of water its actually closer to . bathtubs  assuming a standard size bathtub holds  gallons and oz per gallon.,hardware,ckpco91,12,t5_2qh18

Mid to low end cards will always have their tradeoffs to hit the price to performance andor profit margins.  From the Anandtech reviewgt  Our first Mantleenabled game Battlefield  shows the current Mantle R  performance regressions front and center. At every resolution the R  loses performance sometimes remarkably so. As a result it is limited to DirectD.gt Regressions aside I feel like Battlefield  is a good case for why the R  needs more VRAM or at the very least its not a good choice for x. The sustained performance at  is too low for this game and the performance loss compared to the GB R  appears to be a direct result of VRAM pressure.

2430520,0,t1_cmbllvk,Intel is ahead but they are not really a foundry and they are not as far ahead as it might seem. The numbers used to define process nodes based on minimum transistor length are starting to lose any meaning. Now in the age of finFETs they have no meaning. Another way to look at nodes is by interconnect pitch because that is the real limit on density. Intels pitch at  was nm with direction restrictions because they wanted to avoid double patterning and you cant go much lower than  with single patterning. Direction restrictions means that all the small features on a layer must be the same direction either all horizontal or all vertical. This allows the illumination to be optimized for printing that direction. TSMC which does use double patterning and does not restrict direction at  has a minimum pitch of nm.For nm Intel went for double patterning in an even more restrictive way which allowed them to get the pitch down to nm. TSMC will need to stay a little more flexible with their design rules and will not be able to have a nm pitch for their  process. The foundry business is very competitive and they cannot put the kinds of restriction on customers that Intel can put on Intel because Intel has no competition for Intels business.Some interesting sunshine from Intel here.,hardware,cmc4azd,7,t5_2qh18

2725604,0,t1_cn34gfo,You misunderstood the basics of Intels hyperthreading.Hyperthreading is intels implementation of SMT Simultaneously MultiThreading. SMT is implemented to increase the powereffeciency of a core architecture. Hyperthreading is not an attempt to cover the main memory latencies. This is why we have cache prefetch OOO instruction windows and much more been integrated.Those are been integrated to hide the main memory latency.By having an Instruction Windows you can pick and choose the instruction to execute. This gives the schedule the possibility to match two threads to run simultaneously.When a thread is fetching for data it will be put in a sleep stage. Another process will start running instruction from the OOO window in the meantime. ,hardware,cndw1pe,1,t5_2qh18

Also handling two microphones simultaneously may require additional software unless you plan on using only one at a time.If the wireless one connects via USBBluetoothOtherthanjack you may have your work cutout.If they are both using jacks two jacks per set but are used separately you may want to look at KVM switch with integrated audio or whatever the equivalent for audio only is. Another more elegant solution but likely more costly would be to get a soundcard onboard or outboard with multiple input.

Tons of other errata just get a published notice of well dont do that then.Theres no one right answer.

Turns out there are so many taxfinance lawscodes that its basically impossible to be compliant with all of them at any given time he tells me the US has the most cumbersome and complex set of accounting and finance laws in the world the Internal Revenue Code which is only used to calculate taxes is thousands of pages long. And thats just the IRC not the rulings on the IRC or the regulations to make it easier to understand or case law. Then there the FASB codification which is US GAAP which is how you report publicly.But the method of your internal bookkeeping doesnt really matter that much as long as what you present to the public or auditing authority is correct. Ergo using a computer that goes from  to  wont actually be a problem as long as you correct the dates before you show it off. It would likely become a problem only if it caused a problem.

Hell would the  even have been made or would NVidia have sat back and made  series chips until they were so horribly outdated they risked people giving up gaming completely and thus had to get around to making something new?  In a financial sense companies dont way to innovate.  They want to have the highest profit is to sell the same product forever.  That way you pay off the fixed cost of RnD and just roll in marginal profits forever.   Consumers of course love innovation bigger better faster all for the same price as before how great!

3482809,0,t1_cpp8e9f,Again I think were both in agreement Nvidia designed Maxwell for nm and their original roadmap had the series launching in H. They knew the nm node was making slow progress so they hedged their bets. They delayed the launch to H and limited it to GM pushing GM to . They also threw resources at refining Maxwell between V GTX and Ti and V the GTX chips with even more aggressive power management features along with other changes all the way down to the architectural level in order to make it work at nm.Im not saying that Maxwell was designed purely for nm the GTX proves that they had nm in mind for the low end from the start. Im saying that the high end chips required additional time and resources to reach Nvidias performance and power consumption goals once nm was off the table. Porting a design to a smaller process is relatively easy but porting it up requires cinsideration of the increased heat and power draw inherent to larger transistors.

But its been a really great solution for us.This past March I was working on a big stage magic show at RED Studios and the day of the show one of the magicians told us about a Sony handycam he wanted to use on stage and he wanted that shot up on the IMAG screens for the audience to see. Naturally that POS camera had only HDMI out with HDCP. Piece of cake though just got a  ft. HDMI to the Teranex where the HDCP is stripped and we get a good clean SDI signal.

But generally that is done because its faster than processing the stuff again or loading it off disk. You see everything in a computer is essentially storage. The things you use the most need to be available faster than things you use the least. So on a CPU you have layers of cache. The first is L cache its the fastest. Its pretty small because its pretty expensive. And its expensive because its the fastest. Like in a hybrid HDD with an SSD as cache. Its not a regular mechanical drive. Its faster. But its not an SSD either. It has terabytes of storage. What it does is it just stores your most used files in the SSD part and transparently manages this to make it look like one drive to you. GPU ram is kind of similar. But instead of a traditional storage system as you know it it just stores textures or already processed information so it can easily shove it down your DVIDP cable faster. Computers model our world. You keep the things you use most closest.

4331715,0,t1_csdqmt0,gt The SSD market itself will also shift to pci cards first then drives that go into RAM DIMM slots next.Both of these predictions are wrong.  There will be a shift to the PICe bus from SATA but it wil be via the M. interface not using actual PCIe slots.  This transition has already begun and many high end motherboards are already shipping with M. sockets.There is no indication or rational reason that SSDs will use RAM DIMM slots at any point in the foreseeable future.  What we might see at some point is memristor RAMstorage.  Memristors were theorized almost  years ago but functional components were only recently developed.  The physics behind their operation is pretty heavy but what matters to us consumers is that they can operate as fast as RAM faster theoretically but are nonvolatile like solid state memory.  This means that when theyre finally ready for general use you will be able to buy a single stick of memristor memory that will be your RAM and your hard drive.  Performance and power savings gains will be significant.  Unfortunately there is no ETA for commercial memristor products.  HP is the leading developer of the technology and until recently they expected to have truly revolutionary server prototypes very soon.  Last week they backpedaled on their upcoming prototypes having memristors at all.  Nobody knows when the technology will be ready for prime time and it wont be plugging into standard RAM DIMM slots when it is but its the closest thing to your prediction thats actually likely to happen.,hardware,csdwwe7,5,t5_2qh18

I know  years may seem like a long time to you but for older people who started without the Internet and remember when kb of RAM was enough for everyone it is amazing how fast the technology has advanced. years ago phones didnt do a lot They couldnt do HD graphics let alone video. Playing music was a luxury feature that required a very highend phone.Today my phone runs a full OS and can emulate game systems from  while multitasking. Mobile devices have more RAM than PCs did  years ago in architectures that have discrete RAM and can do D graphics on par or above that of modern game consoles.Now consider how long cellphone existed prior to  years ago and look how quickly theyve evolved to today.Then consider that desktop PCs have evolved in the same way. My first desktop had a bit CPU and overheated playing SimCity. Thats the first SimCity. The MSDOS one.Modern mobile devices are already more powerful than modern lowend desktop PCs. This is a sign that the gap is closing a bit and in the future new generations of hardware will be overtaking by their mobile counterparts more quickly than before. Nvidias next Tegra processor already surpasses the performance of my current desktop PC and it is planned for tablets.When you get to my age  years falls within the foreseeable future.Lastly if you seriously think quantum computing will happen in the next  years you have no idea what quantum computing is.

Of course the answer is as it always is. Handhelds have unique interfaces like thumbsticks and first party games. But at this point in time Id say phones have more first party games and Im not likely to base my entire decision buying a handheld just on first party games.So I guess after typing this out the most convincing reasons would be a game based store instead of a generic google apps that is curated to a higher standard and a better interface. Phones really should come up with something like the nvidia sheild... although I really wish they put the display in the middle of the controllers like the wiiu controller.

4767098,0,t1_ctvdl7x,gtYes. The rumor was VESA wasnt moving fast enough for their liking and thus GSync was born.My point is though that means Intel and NVidia had just as much a hand as AMD. NVidia just deciding to make GSync for rumor has it they were dissatisfied with the progression and thus took their own course.gtAll monitors require circuitry. If the monitor maker wants to add support for VRR into the video scaler chips that they already have to make for the monitor they dont have to pay an extra licensing fee to do it or pay for and add a proprietary module.However they will have to use circuitry that supports varying refresh rates thus they will often be forced to choose between an otherwise similar or identical set of circuitry that does not support varying framerates for cheaper production cost or a more expensive version that does.gtDisplay Port AdaptiveSync is the entirety of the monitor side. If the monitor conforms to that standard then any GPU also running those standards on its end can enable VRR to work. AMD added support for it in their cardsdrivers and called it Freesync.Perhaps. I doubt it for a number of reasons but havent the information I need to truly make the claim either way. For example how exactly does AMDs GPUs communicate with the scalar? Does the scalar chip qualify for VRR but not for Freesync because of some deficit that VRR does not address basically.,hardware,ctvfq2r,2,t5_2qh18

4774283,0,t3_3gae13,gtCUDA CoresThe number of processors in the card that is how many math operations it can do at once. Similar to but not comparable in number to AMD stream processors. The more the card has the more raw compute power. This translates to higher framerates.gtBase and Boost clock MHzThe number of times per second in millions that the CUDA cores tick that is make progress towards finishing an operation. Like CUDA core count the higher this number is the higher your framerate will be. You can increase this number manually which is called overclocking to boost performance. However doing so increases power draw and heat output and the chip can only go so fast before it starts malfunctioning and causing graphical glitches. Modern GPUs can overclock themselves as they see fit as long as they have enough thermal and electrical headroom this is what the Boost clock is.gt Texture fill rateAll D objects are a mesh of polygons wrapped in D textures. Fill rate refers to the number of pixels on the surface of those polygons that can be computed per second. I dont know a ton about this to be honest.gt Memory clock Interface width and BandwidthMemory clock is the clock speed of the GPUs VRAM multiplied by the number of times per cycle that data can be transferred  for GDDR. Data transfers send bits in parallel i.e. multiple at the same time rather than one after another and the number of bits that can be transferred at once is the interface width. Multiply the memory clock by the interface width to get the bandwidth in gigabytes per second between the GPU and VRAM. The higher this is the more texture and model information can be loaded from VRAM and the faster the GPU can draw to the VRAM. This translates to higher framerates because the GPU doesnt have to wait as long to get the data it needs to continue its computation. High bandwidth is especially important for highresolution monitors if the bandwidth isnt enough framerates will fall dramatically.gt Memory typeGDDR is the current standard. Based off DDR its optimized for extremely high throughput at the expense of high latency which is exactly what GPUs need. AMD Fury Fury X and Fury Nano cards use HBM which is very different in manufacturing and board layout. It trades frequency for a much wider interface and the result is roughly doubling bandwidth compared to GDDR. Nvidias nextgeneration Pascal architecture is also going to use HBM.gt Memory capacityThe more memory a GPU has the more models textures and miscellaneous data it can hold without having to load from main system memory over the PCIe interface which is many times slower. High memory capacity is also important with highresolution displays as the memory also holds the buffers that the GPU draws to. As long as a card has enough VRAM to hold what it needs capacity is irrelevant in terms of performance. For example if youre playing an old game that only uses  MB of VRAM having a  GB card does nothing for you. High detail shadows textures and models quickly consume large amounts of VRAM.,hardware,ctwcaa6,33,t5_2qh18

There is a very noticeable difference between ms fps msfps and msfps and even ms fps that you will eventually train your brain to take advantage of. After years of playing at high framerates Ive noticed that after fps it becomes a lot harder to feel framedrops which is why I think and tons of other gamers think it should be the minimum.

Because your feelings themselves are misguided in this case. Intel never sold you the ability to overclock nonK CPUs.

At a guess though you would have to constantly write to the drive for years to see any noticeable effect. So as long as you dont use a script to constantly fill your SSD with junk data and overwrite itself when full  you should be fine for years of use.And even then the concern will most likely be most found in grabbing a new drive and copying the data to continue being able to write as the data should still be accessible. Though this I am not  certain on and may depend on drive etc.Additionally drives usually have a reserve of replacement cells for if cells fail do to excessive writes and it may take even longer then  years of constant writes to actually murder the drive in this way.TLDR  yes you will need to eventually replace the drive but its a time span that is long enough if your drive doesnt turn out to have a flaw that it is possible that SATA is replaced before you need to replace your Drive.,hardware,d0tgtvt,1,t5_2qh18

It only matters on videos that have HDR encoded.  Heres a page with some demos  I think the idea is to set the nits to whatever the video is encoded to as the max nit output  but you can lower the nits to exaggerate the effect or compensate for your display not getting that bright.   I think i used  on my ST.  Be sure to set your contrast to max assuming it doesnt clip anything  which it doesnt on my st Also you may dig through the main MadVR thread on Doom to figure out whats best to output to your ZT from your video card control panel.  For the longest time i just figured that outputting bit with full output levels was what i should be doing  but someone figured out that you get the smoothest gradient by doing bit limited  because the ST wont process  if you output bit or something.   But anyway  watching some of these demos with the display in native color mode was pretty awesome.  It theoretically works on any display  but aside from the blinding nit levels  a plasma is pretty well made to display HDR stuff since they have such good native contrast and bit  bit dithered panels. ,hardware,d23yxna,1,t5_2qh18

The two things we used to leverage for large performance gains  Moores Law and Dennard scaling  have either started to break down for the former or broke long ago for the latter. When transistors are only a few dozen atoms wide quantum effects can start dominating the performance characteristics. It takes a lot of engineering to fight back. Ultimately this means its taking more time and money to shrink transistors and those transistors cant show the same percentage increase in clockspeed that we saw in the s and early s.Architecture improvements are likewise getting hard to do.

7550271,0,t1_d30bwlh,gt Theres a handshake that happens when the game loads and queries what gpus are installed. Each gpu says hi im a XXXX and i can do XXXX much work. The game then decides how to mitigate the work load. You can do gpu does the odd frames and gpu does the even frames or in a mixedmatched setup gpu handles the output and gpu does what it can. Its much easier than you might think since the protocol to send anything to one gpu is the same to send to the second. Theres no added learning curve when you have multiple gpus. at least in vulkan... dont know about dxThis is detection detection and acquisition of devices is much better but where they say Its much easier than you might think since the protocol to send anything to one gpu is the same to send to the second does not actually make anything easier at all.E.G. You have GPU ready to render it has all the vertex buffers ready all the textures loaded and the shaders compiled and ready to render What if GPU doesnt have enough memory to hold the same scene What if GPU doesnt have enough bandwidth to get a full frame to GPU for output in time What if GPU is horrifically slow at a specific SPIRV operationsAll of this has to be handled when the game chooses to schedule tasks so those tasks need to be small very small not render a whole frame and the game code needs to know what and where to schedule. This is not automatic it is not done for you.There will be a lot of NvidiaIntellAMD handles SPIRV instructions batches XYZ much fasterslowercrash so we need to special case ABCHandling full multiGPU will be hard it will not be free at all and many games simply will choose not to do it. At best we will see small amounts of delegation in areas like physics and other disparate systems like shadowmap regeneration.

I dont want to go with nVidia because they have awful drivers that produce a ridiculous amount of system latency which makes them unusable for any system that deals in heavyduty real time audio work. I like gaming but not enough to prioritize them over that. Amd drivers are great and practically never produce a takespoiling pop or crackle in a recording but they just dont have a card worth buying. The s generate too much noise and use too much power everything weaker than them isnt up to snuff for highend gaming and the only thing halfway worthy of consideration is the Fury but its tiddly GB of VRAM kills that option stone dead since that just isnt enough for some of todays games nevermind tomorrows.

7832551,0,t3_4mk9fx,From what I gather production cost variances are fairly insignificant when it comes to the nanoscale. its about the same machines printing different designs. A CPU would probably cost similarly to produce per wafer as with a GPU on the same process regardless of the die size. What changes are the yields per wafer and the market value of the chips.  In short probably yes but insignificantly so. This is why you have things like the K which is an APU with a busted iGP from Gamers Nexus. Cause it makes more sense from a production standpoint and in context of technical marketing to make APUs and sell the imperfect ones as CPUs. And why APUs make sense?? Because they negate the need for OEMs to include a dGP They reduce the total cost of a system without affecting profit margins. At least in theory. In practice its really hard to convince people that iGPs can be fast all thanks to the terrible options we came to expect. And so you have things like HP notebooks having a top tier APUs coupled with a mid tier GPUs.Now as for the ciGP vs c same thing. It wouldnt make much sense from a technical marketing standpoint for such chip to exist... Why? An iGP is more often than not as useful as a blunt knife.,hardware,d3wg2qb,1,t5_2qh18

I was giving an example of something that can be done because of the lack of security in the software.  Whether or not this attack is likely it represents bad security practices on the part of the companies we trust to keep our data intact and safe.Heres a more realistic attack that doesnt require me to be hunted by a government agency or anything dystopian.  There are likely tens of thousands of ASUS computers running this update software that have users dumb enough to get infected with malware thats believable right?  Lets say that malware program cant quite get adminroot privilege on its own.  Since the malware author now knows that updates are installed without verification they can write the malware so that it modifies the downloaded file and inserts malicious code before its installed.  Since this is a BIOSEUFI file and its so core to the system it has to have root access to be installed.  So now you have an official ASUS program which is correctly given root access executing malicious code which can potentially give the rest of the malware program administrative privileges.  Boom now you have malware which can decrypt and look at everything coming in or out of the machine as well as change system settings without permission from the user.

However a  Ti at  with  of Titan X cut down could end up being just as fast but more efficient and higher clocked.  The thing is I dont see the  Ti being much of a value proposition. Theyre in  GPU territory.  In all honesty what would be best for everyone is if AMD drops Vega and its faster than a  but priced at .  This would force Nvidia to bring the  to x series prices around  and drop the  Ti at  as per the norm.  However with how  turned out Im not even sure if AMD has a trump card in their hands. Im a little worried. We almost got to this point before with dfx back in the Voodoo era Voodoo was the best and as a result the Voodoo  release was a shit show and extremely overpriced... Thankfully Nvidia as the underdog came from behind and kicked their ass with the GeForce .  We could very well see a  Ti for  and it would still be a good value because its  cheaper than a Titan X.

8375347,0,t1_d5o7qz9,in any system you can think of input power  output power  losses. in the case of a cpu losses is where our heat comes from and is almost always fairly close to our input power because information doesnt weigh much.somewhat simplistically we have the formula P  CVf  S where P is power dissipation C is capacitance for our purposes a constant V is voltage f is frequency and S is static loss. S includes gate leakage and other imperfections that happen because the world occasionally sucks  right away we notice that P has a linear relationship with f so that if we double f we double P.We should also note that P has an exponential relationship with P of order  if we double V we quadruple P.where we get in to some serious trouble is S. S is a hell of its own as it is dependent on manufacturing process and temperature....and since temperature is related to power the more power we use the more power we need to use. but it gets better worse!!!    the ability to move heat is related to the surface are of a chip....but as we cram more transistors into a smaller area it becomes harder to move all of that heat....also exponentially as area is an exponential unit mmthen we have the heat transfer itself the bigger the temperature difference between your source and your sink the more efficient the heat transfer is. unfortunately this effect isnt large enough at the temperatures we can run our chips at to really help us but when designing a laptop this also must be considered.when we bring it all together we end up with a graph of power vs frequency that curves up at the beginning underclocking speedstep goes up in an almost straight line in the middle normal rated operations then curves up towards the heavens really quickly turbo boost and overclockingtldr its complicated....and im tipsy so ill stop now.,hardware,d5ogvay,6,t5_2qh18

Furthermore Nvidia has a lot of experience with mobile chipsets thanks to their work on Tegra etc. Nvidia would have a product thats more or less ready to go right now. Even if the drivers are lacklustre for a large company like samsung and the volume they put out Nvidia could afford to write new drivers just for those mobile chips alone. Open source or not is irrelevant as long as Samsung gets the source and they of course would. I dont know where youre getting more cooperative partner from and of course the only reason why AMD would offer better licence terms is because a theyre desperate for the cash and b for most applications they would be the technically inferior choice.

9090548,0,t1_d81g49d,gt Intel wants a piece of that high margin mobile market.Intel originally didnt want to enter that market exactly because it isnt high margin.They only changed their minds because OLPC showed Arm as a semi viable alternative to Intel CPUs which made Intel develop the Atom CPU line for Netbooks which launched in  same year as the iPhone. Netbooks were a success too and Intel continued development and improvements on the sluggish Atom but when Android tablets came out it became clear just how far behind Intel was. Arm based tablets ran circles around Atom based netbooks they had better battery life and could run games and play video at p and were much lighter too.Intel of course saw this before we did and increased their ultra mobile efforts to  times the entire revenue of Arm and they kept it there for almost  years before finally giving up because Arm kept edging ahead even when Intel had huge manufacturing advantages. And Arm cores were available cheaply so Intel couldnt make much money on their expensive development and production.The entire effort to stave off Arm was huge both on heavy development of better technologies allocation of the best production facilities in the world heavy marketing and aggressive pricing and incentives to makers.AFAIK Arm is the first independent CPU architecture to stay its ground in battle against Intel so close to Intels core market and for so long.While Arm seemed to be playing it totally cool and not even break a sweat Im pretty sure there must have been lots of sweating over Intels constant pressure against Arms home turf. But Arm managed to increase revenue and profits while Intel was pouring money down what seemed more and more like a bottomless pit. And finally this year they gave up.Now Apple has the A out and as in previous years its another huge improvement of the Arm core that just about doubles performance and also improves ppw. The AX edged into desktop performance territory and even the standard A already beats it. If the rumors are true as I personally suspect they are the AX will eat pretty deeply into Intel performance territory.Intel isnt merely competing against their own previous successful CPUs. They also have to prepare for more competition from AMDs Zen throughout the entire range where Intel CPUs are used and from Arm ever deeper into more performance oriented systems where power consumption also plays a significant role.Basically Intel is facing much harder competition they seem to have held back in traditional markets to better segment and monetize them and its coming back to bite them now because it has left them more vulnerable because they have focused mainly on monetizing instead of improving in their core markets.,hardware,d84jcgx,1,t5_2qh18

My heartburn with Intel stems from their labeling of the laptop CPUs as i parts wherease that means something different on the desktop.  A laptop i is a pathetic weakling compared to a desktop i.  I run simulation and mathematical modeling software and there has been very little improvement computationally from my past two new laptops.  It takes almost the same amount of time to complete a processing job today as it did in  on the laptop whereas the desktops have improved greatly.

The best you can do is ask enterprise guys guys that buy these things by the bucketload and get really pissed off when things fail. rsysadmin would get you a good response. From my enterprise experience Samsung Ive yet to see one fail. Far over  in use. Models we use SM SM  PRO  EVO  PRO  EVO.  Intel I dont have any that arent dead. Probably around  total. Wait just one an old SLC drive still in its packaging. That one is a Schrodinger both alive and dead at the same time. We just stay away from them now after the mb bug that they kept telling us was our fault after countless times losing all data we gave up and refuse to buy them.  Crucial Very cheap and reliable. Several hundred in use now mostly as secondary storage as they are fairly slow. Model M SanDisk I hate these things. Model A. We call them dumb sticks. They suck ass and dont have a compatible alternative. Failure rate around . Their firmware doesnt help although they are happy to constantly replace them. Ive seen  fail in one laptop in the course of about  months.  Kingston We have tons of these in use and they work great. My only gripe with them is that they change hardware in their drives that effects promised performance without telling anyone. Failure rate I would say around  over the course of about  years. Samsung is basically the Intel of SSDs. They manufacture and sell way more SSDs than anyone else. They also manufacture every part of the drive by themselves without outsourcing. The only other company that does that is Toshiba. Toshiba as a brand isnt exactly screaming reliability and thats before you throw in the fact that most of their SSD prowess comes from OCZ. The other companies are great for competition but if you want reliable hardware stick with Samsung. Especially because their drives arent exactly the most expensive anyway. ,hardware,dbg2hv6,3,t5_2qh18

10260824,0,t1_dc5i2p9,gt  Much cheaper sockets for a fairly minimal increase in CPU cost and more idiotproof installation procedure. LGA and AM motherboards are comparable in price both start at  for entry level boards and go up to  for a niceish board so this either isnt true at manufacturingscale quantities or it isnt translating into lower retail prices.gt  The real question is why Intel use LGA.Because if you goof up beyond repair its better to replace a  motherboard than a  processor.  Let alone once were talking  for Zen or k for a K.Mounting a consumer LGA processor isnt really tricky at all the same rules apply as with PGA namely  align the arrow  drop straight in  dont bend the pins by applying lateral force.  Tons and tons of people mount LGA CPUs without any trouble.In a technical sense things start getting ugly with PGA ZIF sockets with really high pin counts.  The higher the pin count the more difficult to get them all slotted into their sockets.  And despite the name  theres no such thing as zero insertion force the more pins the more friction.  AM is going to have  pins which is a lot for ZIF and I think itll be interesting to see how well that works but that doesnt even compare to something like the highend Intel socket with  pins.  You cant do things like quadchannel memory without more pins and that necessitates LGA.  Even AMD has gone to LGA sockets for their highend products that need higher pinouts  Socket G has quadchannel memory and its an LGAbased socket too.  They use it on their Socket C server lineup too.  They just havent pushed this down to their consumer lineup for some reason.And then you start talking about something like Knights Landing with hexchannel memory and now were talking about upwards of  pins on the socket and it really starts to drive home how dinky AM is with its  pins.  Its reportedly a technical challenge to make KNLs mounting work even with LGA.  Id say this is pretty much the limit of how far you can push pincounts even with duallever LGA.Dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with PGA especially on lowcost lowend platforms AM comes to mind.  But its a bit of an anachronism in a highend system in .  LGA is the norm and it has its advantages too higher pincount the delicate bits are on the motherboard etc.,hardware,dc74ca8,1,t5_2qh18

10381350,0,t1_dcks49g,I think common CPU cooler heat pipes actually do not use anything too exotic for their working fluid I believe water is a common choice with a partial vacuum applied to lower the boiling point below  deg C or an alcohol like methanol b.p.  deg C or Ive heard acetone mentioned too b.p.  deg C.Since there are no electronics inside your heat pipe or your vapor chamber I think the requirements are a lot less strict. With immersion cooling you have to make sure that you arent submerging your motherboard in something that will damage it over time. I think these Novec fluorinated hydrocarbon fluids could be used in a heat pipe or vapor chamber although they may not be ideal choices maybe heat of vaporization is too low?. ,hardware,dcksgj6,2,t5_2qh18

10849504,0,t1_ddyxt45,gtWhats wing with expecting the same performance or of a smaller form factor?Dunno about the others but to me both yours and OPs questions boil down to being unable to both have the cookie and eat it. I mean it is self evident that size is a limitation you have to work around whenever designing a miniITX motherboard. For example it is physically impossible to fit standard CPU socket  DIMM slots PCIe x and array of misc necessary stuff within xcm so you have to give up something.Question about why manufacturers dont make motherboards with particular set of compromises OP wants is less silly though and several people addressed those. You have to look at them mostly from point of view of manufacturer making a profitable product and not simple physical possibility People who want miniITX and  memory slots are niche within niche  it is hard to make money on a specific design that is quite different from everything else and targets only a tiny market. Especially if your differentiation point is comparably weak. Proposed solution of putting SODIMM on the back is possible to implement  motherboard standoffs are mandated to be at least .mm while lowest flat SODIMM socket is around mm. There are two issues with it harder access and higher manufacturing cost due to having components on both sides of PCB. Putting  vertical SODIMMs on front side seems to be easiest at first glance physical connector is about  times smaller than normal DIMM. It still does require working around unusually high trace density and possibly would require many more PCB layers large extra cost. To the boot DRAM traces are really a bitch to design  probably they are the hardest part to do overall.So yea  it is almost certainly possible. It is just that its cost relative to size of target market makes it unlikely to be profitable.,hardware,ddz1sq9,3,t5_2qh18

You can even get ECC cheaply if you confine yourself to Pentium and i lines. AMDs desktop chips have all had ECC before now and there is some little evidence to confirm the new Ryzen chips are likely to have it too unlike Intel i and i.AMDs virtualization instruction svm is not identical to Intels unlike most instructions where both brands implement the same instruction. As far as I know though AMDs svm works identically in practice.

They gut too much of the customization. However having repaired them for years there is a very clear difference between the quality of Apples products and that of their competitors.Razers an Apple wannabe. Like Apple theyre not afraid to try new things. However they dont put nearly as much care in making sure their designs are robust. They fall apart quickly. Ive tossed  of their Razer Nagas at this point  one by ESD if they were properly shielded this wouldnt have been an issue one because of doubleclick issues and the recent model has scroll wheel problems. Razer seriously neglects their hardware and they dont have the kind of excellent customer support legacy necessary to make up for it.Someone below said that Razer is like Alienware... thats a much more apt description. Razer has the facade of being a premium product while having shitty innards.,hardware,dffg5y8,12,t5_2qh18

11334066,1,t1_dfgkqmi,People pick and choose based on what they want to hear. A great example is the recent video that was made by AdoredTV regarding low resolution benchmarks as an indicator of future performance. A lot of people didnt like how pro Zen he was being in his videos and that he predicted that Zen would out perform Kaby Lake as well as BroadwellE in every application once the platform had the kinks smoothed out. So people refuted his conclusions citing a Hardware Unboxed video that tested the claims and found dramatically different results than the ones used in the AdoredTV video.    Yet where did AdoredTV get his data from? Computerbase. Yet despite the fact that hes sourcing information from a credible and reputable website people who wanted to disagree with him just used the Hardware Unboxed results and took them as gospel despite the clear and staggering differences between the two sources simple because it fit their preconceived idea.    I even asked Steve at Hardware Unboxed why the results between his testing and Computerbase were so different. His response was simply that he didnt care. Frankly this attitude is very arrogant and unscientific. We have a situation where hardware fans are trying to work out whats going on and we have different people publishing very different results and no attempt is being made to reconcile these differences in order to get to the bottom of everything. Steve simply says believe me if you want to if you dont unsubscribe from my channel paraphrasing. However this is the whole problem in a nutshell.

But if thats not convincing enough just look at the release notes for the latest RST driversgt Resolved issue Optane UI allows enabling OptaneVolume with other NVMe SSDs.They only just recently resolved the issue that allowed you to use their caching algorithm with any drive. Because of course it would work. gtCan you explain in your theory why Intel would intentionally inflate their own product cost by not using cheaper flash for this specific use and reduce their own margin on the product with same or worse performance vs your suggestion?  Because they dont want to cannabalize the sales of their larger SSDs. Heres a dirty little secret about the storage industry with good caching algorithms theres almost no need for a consumer to have any more than GB of flash. Its trivially easy to identify which files would benefit from being cached and to preload them and with a large enough cache you could have many terabytes of total storage at full SSD speeds for the price of a large HDD and a moderately sized SSD. But no one in the industry has any money to make by doing that  system builders and console manufacturers make huge margins upselling on storage capacity and SSD vendors like Intel need a reason to sell those huge SSD drives. Its not like Intel has any hard drives to sell so theyre not going to release something that makes their SSDs seem like a bad value. So no one has any incentive to make the caching as good as it can be and every incentive to handicap it. gtWhy are you so confident there are no technical hurdles to doing what you suggest?  Because Ive written algorithms myself that do it better and it works exceptionally well  but I dont have the resources or time to patent and market it and Id probably get crushed by lawyers before it got off the ground because it threatens a billion dollar industry.
