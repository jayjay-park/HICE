4662273,0,t1_cti7tdm,I had lost my PC rosewood and felt perpetually sad about it until I found it under a pile of laundry last week  soooo guess I should clean more often.  I read about the bpal one on a thread about peach perfumes on IMAM  and was lucky enough to find it in a destash that weekend. I just got some of the marshmallow menagerie in my most ttl order and while its not the longest lasting Im sort of in love with chocolate mint because its like thin mints.  Organic blueberries is my jam forever tho. ,indiebeauty,cti8hka,2,t5_38pys
4662316,0,t1_cti5ruu,The majority of my polishes are nonindie I really like Zoya Covergirl Outlast and Milani. Theyre all really good and are  or  free as well.  My first intro to indie polishes was Rainbow Honey. I use their scented top coats all the time and just started using their base coat. They have some really good colors but the formula varies a lot with some colors being really goopy.  I just got a few Femme Fatale polishes and Im planning to get some more ,indiebeauty,cti8oku,2,t5_38pys

4716092,0,t3_3finvs,Raves Fyrinnae came out with their lipsticks yesterday and of course I got the vampy one Empowering. I cant wait for it to arrive and Ill definitely take swatches for you guys when it arrives. My Preen replacement lipstick arrived yesterday. I really like it! I got the colour Mouring Dove and two samples in Varied Bunting and Rose Robin. They wear pretty darn good for a creamy formula. However if I dont take care of my dry lips beforehand they do start to go into lip lines and become quite drying. Thats the only bad thing I can think about them. Overall theyre great! My full size of Shiro Always Angry arrived a few days ago  its huge! I dont think Ill be running out of it any time soon. I really like it! It covers up my redness.  I brought KPT Same Fall Different Begining nail polish for my birthday along with some Asian skincare items. Its so stunning o I think Im gonna fall down the rabbit hole of indie nail polishes which is good cause I dont have much nail polish to begin with. I cant remember who recommended me it for which I do apologise but thank you  Fyrinnae Delicious arrived and its everything I ever wanted in a purple lipstick ltRants Meh just waiting for stuff to arrive. ,indiebeauty,ctp032f,2,t5_38pys

5039254,0,t1_cutf26d,Last Exit For The Lost from the Sixteen Fall collection might be your best bet for fruits  the apple note is super fresh on me and the drydown is a lovely grounded musk to keep that fall feel to it. Definitely pick up whatevers left from her summer collection namely Beautiful and the Damned for grapefruit and maybe Blood and Honey plus Lolita and Southern Gothic if you like your fruits!  Her lotions are fun too  formula is nothing to special but theyre pretty good for what they are.Your other fruity options are definitely Arcana  you seriously cant go wrong with her stuff. ,indiebeauty,cutf69p,3,t5_38pys
5072452,0,t1_cux7tdh,And now I have three Limnits in my cart! I actually just placed my first order from Kae Q I ordered a full sized Coconut and a sample of Herbology I cant wait to get them! Youre welcome for the recs I hope you find a winner from TTL! ,indiebeauty,cuxf7xv,2,t5_38pys

7101086,0,t3_4cqno1,I bought one of those Bath and Body Works wall plugs and a handful of bulbs since I didnt want to burn some candles. YIKES the one I used today was intense smelled amazing but gave me a headache Indigo Skies  deep blue air sundappled orange blossoms and soft amber.  Going to a paint clay cafe thingie next week with some local ladies. Im pretty excited. Plus peer pressure for uswimmingmonkey  peeeeeeeeeeeer pressureMIL said she wanted to visit in a few weeks my only condition is if FIL comes because his dry sarcasm is my cup of tea. MIL isnt nearly as bad as some of the stories on rJUSTNOMIL but I have a really hard time dealing with her when food and anything related to customer service are involved. On the other hand I love crafting and shopping with her.,indiebeauty,d1la3ds,4,t5_38pys
7233758,0,t3_4eg9bt,Never heard of them sorry. But the name makes me want tater tots.The packaging looks halfassed in the pictures though which is annoying. And there are no ingredients lists on the handful of listings I opened or anywhere I could see in the shop so based on that alone I wouldnt buy them.,indiebeauty,d20fbvb,2,t5_38pys
