3224845,0,t1_cow1q6e,The Pentax is great and very rugged. The Sony will be less rugged and wont have the same battery life but itll have comparable image quality and a much smaller size. The Canon is a totally different camera. It definitely wont have the image quality of the other two but its about the size of a deck of cards. Out of all the tiny point and shoot cameras out there its probably the best one. The Canon will basically be the nicest auto point and shoot you can realistically buy. Both the Pentax and Sony will be more cumbersome but if you get into photography as a hobby theyll grow with you more and will allow you to start building a system around them. ,Cameras,cow9bxu,2,t5_2r7pa

If you treat the Nikon properly and shoot cinematically I personally feel there isnt a significant difference especially if youre shooting with proper lighting and filtration.In real world applications the differences are slight Canon colors are not by default more vibrant. Colors will look slightly different between all cameras but ultimately vibrancy is down to what profile or style youre using how youre shooting and how youre grading that footage afterwards. Nikons can and have been used in professional settings and look great Wilfred shoots on the Nikon D and I feel like that show looked very vibrant. ,Cameras,cpb8ms9,1,t5_2r7pa

The same ISO on a larger sensor is going to look much better than that ISO on a smartphone. Id go no smaller than a m sensor or Sonys  sensor to see a noticeable bump in quality though.As for your requirements. Again AF is fast on any modern camera body. Dont worry about megapixels you need to focus on a decent sized sensor. and  Goes back to sensor with the latter also tied into your choice of lens. You are talking about focusing point not necessarily manual focus as you are describing. M has had touchscreen focus for years.In conclusion with your touchscreen focus larger sensor and lowlight capabilities AND it has to be a small form factor?...drumroll...

Theyre all very good cameras the RX line is probably a bit better in lower light and to do better youd have to go up to at least  cameras like the LX or the Canon GX Mk II.Keep in mind there is no one best camera and its impossible to say this camera is better than that camera. There are different cameras that are better at specific uses than others but its pretty much always a trade off. Case and point Ive heard a lot of people prefer the RX Mk II over the Mk III because of the more telephoto zoom and the hotshoe.

5022113,0,t3_3jpobw,A few points Your  lens is a wide angle zoom. Its going to do a good job at landscapes and portraits.  Its creeping into the telephoto range but its not meant to be a great telephoto lens. The Nikkor  will do great at either portraits or telephoto scenarios but it will not capture a sweeping landscape like your other lens.  Its not wide enough. Be very suspicious in general of any zoom lens that tries to cover too wide of a range.  They usually are not good in low light scenarios and have image quality problems compared to a prime lens or a zoom lens that has a tighter range. There are inexpensive prime lenses of high quality that are great for  thing only.  For instance a mm prime makes a great landscape lens.  A  or  mm prime makes a great portrait lens.  A  mm lens makes a good telephoto lens.  And the prime lenses usually work much better in low light.  You might consider having an array of prime lenses for the type of photography you do.  ,Cameras,curcu1t,1,t5_2r7pa

However Id go for one with an APSC sensor over Micro Four Thirds because its pretty much always better.Part of whats great about a mm lens on a full frame camera is that it has a normal field of view  it sees objects the same way you see them where a wide angle would be zoomed out and a telephoto would be zoomed in. Because of the different sensor sizes a normal lens on an APSC camera is mm and mm on Micro Four Thirds. You can find both with fast apertures around f. for shallow depth of field and good low light performance.,Cameras,cwb2ns7,3,t5_2r7pa

6737378,0,t1_d0fugri,Compared to Nikon and Fuji Canon has a much better handle on right hand only operation.  When shooting and composing all of the controls are on the right hand.  The left hand is for operating the lens.  Nikon and Fuji place the AFpoint selector and drive controls on the left hand in such a way that you have to take your eye away from the composition and onto the camera.  Canon places these on the top deck with a row of buttons accessed from the index finger with a readout in the viewfinder  you can change during composition.  Not only that but its consistent each button does  things the one on the left is thumbwheel controlled the one on the right is fingerwheel controlled.  For instance the first button is white balance or metering mode.  In the viewfinder on the left you see white balance options on the right you see metering options.  On the top plate left side is white balance on the right is metering options.Other little nuances I prefer the big circular dial that I can continuously move with the thumb much more than partially exposed wheels e.g. Fuji and Nikon.The menu system is very logical.  From the D of  to the D. of  the idea is the same shooting settings playback settings camera settings in that order.

9946686,0,t3_5hxwsn,As a beginners travel camera the GF is a great option. Its main advantage is its tiny size and quality kit lens with a widerthannormal wide end. For vacation youll probably want to consider also picking up a telephoto lens either of the Panasonic mm f. or mm f.. For your purposes really any entry level mirrorless camera from Panasonic Fuji Olympus or Sony would do the job. Though at that price point I doubt youll find a better deal than the GF. If you arent planning on buying multiple lenses then you might be better served by a highend compact camera like a Sony RX IIIIIIV or Canon GX GX III. That being said I doubt youd find one of these anywhere near that price and the GF offers more flexibility if you plan to expand your lens kit either now or in the future. ,Cameras,db42u12,1,t5_2r7pa

It is also in the upper range of your budget.Due to the budget Id recommend going to your local Best Buy and talking to a sales rep about what exactly needs your boyfriend might be needing and you might be able to pull a  point and shoot camera.

10933052,0,t3_5w5qwh,Its a great camera. We live in at a time of magic and you pretty much cant find a bad DSLR. Plus you can always get a new body later and use your old lenses. If you dont care about video Id go even older and step up to the prosumer category. For still photography the superior ergonomics weather sealing and the feel in your hands is more important than latest sensor tech imo  though of course the lack of superhigh ISO can be a little limiting if youre doing a lot of indoor shooting in dim light. I love my Canon D for example  and it and its later revisions  and D can be had for next to nothing these days. Its a decade old but is just lovely to use still. It was my first real camera a few years ago and Im quite happy I went with it over a new rebel. Still have it as my backup. Recently took it out on the water and its just as wonderful to shoot as it ever was. Modern cameras are amazing and the limitation is pretty much always going to be your skill. You literally cant go wrong with any serious camera made in the last ten years. More even my big DSLR is a D   years old now. Still amazing.,Cameras,de7o1cj,4,t5_2r7pa

11475746,0,t3_63r9nv,Those are two very different cameras. One is an interchangeable lens mirrorless and the other is a compact. Between the two the M should have better low light performance because it has a larger sensor and you can slap on a nice fast lens. If youre leaning towards a system camera like the M then check out some of the Micro  options from Olympus and Panasonic. Or Fuji makes great cameras also.,Cameras,dfwrs84,2,t5_2r7pa

Thats what you have set here.If you dont want that then you can turn off constant preview but then that will not show you exactly what your image will look like based on your exposure settings.This is pretty much how every live view works.As for the a thats subjective.
