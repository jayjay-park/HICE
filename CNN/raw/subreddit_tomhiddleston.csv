I mean ffs hes named after the god of war dont even get me started on the deeper meaning of that!Hes also quite obviously meant to be sexy otherwise he wouldnt have been assembled into the tightest fucking pants they could find or told to bulk up. To say nothing of certain things in this interpretation that werent quite there in the original stage directions...Now a lot of us straight and bi ladyfolk  were really into that shit.

Marion Cotillard never sang so much as a single note in La Vie en Rose and she still went home with a welldeserved Oscar that year because her portrayal of Piaf was supremely accurate. Likewise the success of this movie will depend on Toms ability to bring Hank Williams the Person  not the Singer  back to life and make the audience love him for all his flaws not on whether he can get his voice to be exactly as high and twangy as Hanks was.Just... bah.

Plus fuels the city with income because the state is already hella broke as it is. They really should make it better. I was in NJ  weeks ago and went to ny for a small day trip over a weekend.

5316136,0,t1_cvq17u6,My thoughts were similar. I just dont see him as Bond and it has zero to do with his abilities. Bond just seems always like a character that had less vulnerability and Tom excels in that vulnerability with his work. That is what made his characters so interesting to watch. I cant believe how much talk there is going around about a new Bond. I dont want Daniel Craig to leave the role. Ive liked him as Bond and still do.,tomhiddleston,cvr765y,1,t5_2u1tx

5849734,0,t1_cxm7mp8,I completely agree with that to be honest. I mean I feel like a lot of his problems stem from a very... Rigid childhood but the fall was a tipping point. Up until that point in his mind at least he had done everything he thought his father wanted and when Odin rejected that I think it said a lot to Loki not only about how Odin viewed him but also about how wrongly he misinterpreted what was expected of himself as a son prince and at that point a king. ,tomhiddleston,cxmfftl,4,t5_2u1tx
