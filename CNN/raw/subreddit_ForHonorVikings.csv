If youd like a Gb after the shield parry is very very hard to gbc due to the stun and exhausted screen effects your enemy will be seeing.

It is also clear that knights and samurai dont want us to win the second round so they will try to keep us small and then fight each other just a bit until the last few days probably. Soon enough either the Samurai or the knights will decide to attack the other big faction and as we are stabilizing now we will then be able to push back the tin cans and the pillow lovers to regain our strength. If we can do this all we have to do is focus on getting easy to defend territories which also means not pushing the middle since its a waste of war assets really but taking the flanks and not pushing too far into enemy territory but stabilizing for the final few days. Its going to come down to who has the most people playing in the last  days anyways so it is better for us that we are pushed back this early than later!,ForHonorVikings,degfayi,3,t5_3itkv

If you learn the Warlords map positions yep there are ideal spots for him you can fight off  attackers by throwing them off a ledge..

11589997,0,t3_65ds6m,Either way we need our people on more then Ever right now. To rely on Ubisoft to use logic is asking for more the Freyja could conjure up so we have to win simply by playing the extremely broken faction war to its rules I personally cant get over the loss we took in round  due to the fact that we deployed the most assets so to have faith that theyll base the whole season on said rationality is risky. My guess is if the tin cans win whoever is second will be the winner which also means we have to kick the samurais ass because they can sneak up on us knights and them have done some shady shit like that before. Our best hope is to just try to hold the same exact territories for as long as we can I.E lets say we have  territories I think our best chance is to abuse the defender bonuses and just focus on keeping a majority of the territories for a steady amount of time that way we can sit comfortably and play reactive as possible but I could be wrong ,ForHonorVikings,dg9qfli,3,t5_3itkv
