I have taken a variety of health courses and am an advocate of health awareness Ive seen how much food influences our health conditions disease can be prevented a lot by diet or intentional eating in regards to prevention and healthy living. Its been a project of mine to organize a variety of sources relating to health awareness maybe we could work together.,HireaWriter,d0rg2mo,1,t5_2zlvj
7045342,0,t1_d1exwf4,For sure. Im hoping its better than say  for every  responses or something like that. Lots of businesses are offering simply atrocious rates so it wouldnt be surprising to see that here as well. But Im interested to hear about it.,HireaWriter,d1ey4a0,1,t5_2zlvj

7793498,0,t3_4lzd1d,I believe your tag should be Hiring. For Hire is what a writer would tag hisher post when looking for work they are posting an about being For Hire you are posting an ad saying that you are hiring.I am interested I have slightly better than basic HTML knowledge and have experience in SEO amp content management for ecommerce. My longest job in content management had me writing product descriptions for Puzzles Plush Toys and BrainTeaser games witty and fun was my tone of choice and we got several customer comments on the product descriptions.In my experience a payperword structure is not ideal for this type of setup. The best description is not the longest one value to you is in quality of the post not quantity of the words. Your ideal candidate would set about to create descriptions of quality attentiongrabbing tonestyle accurate and informative product details concise but thorough. However that would mean that the writer would be often working harder to receive less compensation.May I suggest something more along the lines of a per description payout possibly with performance incentives. Determine how much a good informative and catchy description for each product is worth to you and decide on a per description rate. If sales increase past predetermined marks then an additional performance incentive fee would be paid out to the writer. This creates an environment where you can more directly determine effect and value of the service you are receiving while allowing the writer to work their best towards the best possible compensation for the value they create.,HireaWriter,d3s1pp1,1,t5_2zlvj

9600778,0,t1_d9wh2p4,Its not so much that he has an agenda. Its just hes extremely vulgar and rude which makes us all look bad by comparison.So like if someone posts here and their pay is low or even if they are asking for free writing instead of calmly telling them that their rates are low hell continuely berate them and he wont let up. And for posts like these that are asking for academic writers which admittedly is an unethical branch of writing hell comment like the original comment in this thread. And not that he was vulgar or anything but it was a bit rude. There are people in this sub like me that really depend on gigs like this. Its how I make a living. And instead of having a peaceful debate about ethics or whatever hell just fly off the handle. Were all writers here. If we cant have a peaceful and productive debate about random issues through textbased comments then who can? This is a rather small community and a few bad eggs can really spoil it for the rest of us. Who wants to post jobs here when theyre afraid some stranger on the Internet is going to make them feel bad about what they have to offer? Its toxic and I for one cant stand it. ,HireaWriter,d9whq83,2,t5_2zlvj
9943069,0,t1_db3ke9p,hmm. but whats your starting budget look like? for someone who has no expertise and no existing portfolio? i think you should at least throw the writers here a bone so they know whether its worth considering. ,HireaWriter,db3ltvx,1,t5_2zlvj

11760300,0,t3_67jfdy,Though Ive been in the smut writing game for five years nearly all of my work has been in the fanfiction realm but Im looking to branch out into original content. You can find all of my published work here  . I can write roughly k words in a given week on average but have written as much as k as the moodmuse hit. months out of the year Im a college teacher and with the lapse in summer pay I look for odd jobs but I still treat each job like its my career. This would be my first paying erotica job but Im used to working with a writing partner and serving as editor as much as writer so giving and taking notes is nothing new. Most of what I have written has been straight love scenes but I have written several ff ones as well as a couple group encounters and while I have never written any mm work I am open to it as well as most kinks if the job requires it. I believe that my strengths lie in dialogue as well as imagery and that shines through in my works as Ive grown as a writer.I hope that this has been a decent rundown of what I offer and of course please message me if there are any questions or concerns.,HireaWriter,dgt25qu,1,t5_2zlvj
