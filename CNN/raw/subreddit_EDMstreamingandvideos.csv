4961674,0,t3_3isix0,I really recommend OBS Open broadcast software. Its free and so easy to set up. Havent tried other software so couldnt say if its the best. But its been flawless and easy to use for me. At the moment I dont use a webcam I just use the monitor capture so everyone can see my screen. I also just ordered a mic today. Its the Blue Snowball USB mic. Im gonna test it out today and see how it works. Previously I didnt have a mic and just had audio from FL but well see. ,EDMstreamingandvideos,cujyhu9,1,t5_39lr3
