I am sure if any of you have taken a chemistry course you will have seen the formula for this reaction a few times. This is a synthesis reaction which is modeled by Zn  S  ZnSBasically all that is done is powdered Zinc Zn and Sulfur S are made into a mixture i.e not already a compound and then they are given energy in the form of fire to start the reaction between themselves forming Zinc Sulfide. Note that when it is initially lit there is a slight blue flame. This is most likely due to sulfur and later I may post more about this interesting property later if I find some good visuals.,chemicalreactiongifs,chhf5bu,15,t5_2u506

You could feel the radiant heat from  feet away. The goal was to have the liquid iron run out of the hole in the bottom of the pot and melt through the car.Unfortunately I made two mistakes I used a free donated pot from home depot that had a crack in it so it split and dumped the stuff everywhere. I also could have put the magnesium igniter in the bottom not the top and burned from the bottom up but I thought that might have caused it to throw burning thermite around everywhere if the bottom ignited under compression.,chemicalreactiongifs,csi56bs,2,t5_2u506

6302105,0,t1_cz4lv3m,Thanks for sharing! From what I gathered this seems kind of specific to salts right? In the case of pureish water there isnt any dissolving of the anhydrous salt into the melted water which is what seemed to cause the energy release.  Water is just.... water.  deep thoughts I know.  But it got me thinking and I think I have at least an intuitive understanding of my own question.  Also I could be way off.  Imagine two glasses of fully liquid water at  CGlass A Prepared with nucleation sites as to encourage freezing. scratches on glass air bubbles in waterGlass B Minimized nucleation sites to prevent freezing.  Now start taking heat from them at the same rate aka cooling them.  Glass A starts converting all of the liquid water to ice taking a relatively large amount of energy but without changing the temperature of the waterice mix.  Continue to remove heat. Glass B undergoes no phase change and the temperature continues to drop as heat is removed.  side note I actually found a pretty cool source for stats on supercooled liquids Stop removing heat from each glass when the temperature of the water reaches C. Glass A has had enough energy removed to both freeze the water and then lower the ice to C.  However since glass B never went through a phase change and only had to supercool to C it has had much less energy extracted from it or has more energy in it despite being the same temperature as Glass A.  When an external shock occurs in the supercooled Glass B nucleation rapidly propagates and that excess heat is released as the supercooled water turns to C ice.  ,chemicalreactiongifs,cz5z80d,1,t5_2u506

10826169,0,t1_ddwecpx,Preface For some reason I am writing essay responses to every comment tonight. Sorry Im just bored as hell.Haha... yeah. I still find it insane the power they give teenagers. I was the Manager of a pretty big pool at  and a supervisor at  freaking years old for this company. Making schedules being responsible for County inspections ordering supplies and negotiating with HOAs.They end up saving a ton of money with the combination of teenage managementemployees and importing foreign English students and paying them shit.Ill never forget the conditions we put these poor kids in...  or  to an apartment that should only hold . They needed to be within walking distance of their assigned pool and some of the pools were in expensive ass areas.They did seem to really enjoy it though. We did Poland one year and the guys who worked for me said the money they made over the summer would end up being their spending money for the entire school year. We would pay them minimum wage as well which is a lot less than domestic hires made. Minimum wage  expensive rent  charging them for trainingcertificationsuniforms... it made me understand that I must have been absolute shit with moneyThey were always really grateful and hardworking... it just felt like exploitation at some points. They were technically here on an language immersion school trip for their English class but fuckk... I always felt bad knowing that the shitty  year old girl who is on her phone all day not doing shit is probably making  more an hour than their foreign imports that busted their ass all day. We never had a shortage of applicants though so they must have enjoyed it.The best part was that we knew at least  would go missing every year towards the end of the program. They would seize the opportunity since they were already through border control and just stay in America. We never went after them or anything... but damn. These people were normally in college yet it was still worth it to leave all that and work under the table as a dishwasher or something to stay here.Story time Ill never forget when we had a foreign import from Peru find that the pH of one of our hot tubs was a little too high so she poured undiluted muriatic acid directly into the hot tub while people were freaking in it. She also didnt test the chlorine levels before doing it and didnt realize that it was at like ppm at the time. For reference a hot tub should be ppm.Well muriatic acid  chlorine  mustard gas... you can imagine how that turned out. Nothing worse than leaving for lunch and seeing a ton of emergency services in the parking lot on your returnSorry again for the rant... I hope it  was at least mildly entertaining.TlDr You should be kinda scared at pools knowing that the chemicals that kept the pool safe and the lifeguard who would be rescuing you are normally  year olds. . ,chemicalreactiongifs,ddwn5nz,3,t5_2u506

I suspect that the cool strips we see are at the borders to the cells inside the mug.gt Also the sheet doesnt have to achieve thermal equilibrium to change colors in fact we are seeing a transient effect with the colors. Not sure what youre going for here. When the sheet equilibrates our ability to resolve the borders between convection cells inside the mug is lost. Its only that narrow window when the temperature is sufficiently different that we get that nice gradient of colors.  gt So the colors change on a thermal conduction diffusivity timescale  no big surprise hereAgreed. I just like that the theyre all approximately the same. In my work the first order of business in any problem to figure out what timescales different processes are acting on because they generally act on timescales that differ by orders of magnitude. ,chemicalreactiongifs,dg1uhk5,6,t5_2u506

11806815,0,t1_dgyauiy,It really depends on what you connect to it. If you force a fixed voltage onto it then a low resistance results in a large power. If you force a fixed current through it then a large resistance results in a large power.In the present case it looks like from observing the display both voltage and current are limited. That means that both a very small and a very large resistance would result in a small power and no fire. You need to be somewhere in between.,chemicalreactiongifs,dgycd4d,5,t5_2u506
