650364,0,t3_21lhk6,Make sure you use double precision instead of real. Edit never mind just saw at the top that you are... Try n  realN,fortran,cge72wb,1,t5_2r5uf
1406260,0,t3_2a8cp9,The solution is to specify format strings for the write statements.  For example    writeAIA Integrate constant x power ,fortran,cisjz7p,4,t5_2r5uf

5848079,0,t1_cxluv8u,Fortran is still superior for pure numerical calculations.And do not discount what umounder states about legacy code. I have worked in industry academics and government and there is Fortran legacy code outtheass that has been around since the s or s.Quite frankly it is foolish to rewrite literally millions of lines of code in some other language. Especially considering that in  years some other kid is going to say Why do they still teach ltwhatevercodeuwezzwestbrookprefersgt?Nowdays more of the numeric stuff is still written in Fortran with the coupling and file manipulation performed in some other language currently we use shell scripting but there is a current move to Python but again in  years that will be old too.Basically If it aint broke dont fix it.   ,fortran,cxm7mgz,7,t5_2r5uf
5881671,0,t3_3vphh3,Im a bit surprised that nobody mentioned Julia here. Its still in its infancy but has great potential in scientific and engineering computing imho. Its designed with performance in mind and its syntax is similar to Python and Matlab. Checkout rJulia and also of course www.julialang.org,fortran,cxqmbpv,4,t5_2r5uf
6206586,0,t1_cyszigy,I wouldnt expect boundary issues in Fortran arrays to ever show up when compiling. The best way Ive found to check for boundary issues is to include a compiler flag like the one umartingabe mentioned. Alternatively you can also use fcheckall if you want to have the program check more broadly for errors during runtime.,fortran,cyv4f6v,1,t5_2r5uf

8321092,0,t1_d5h7oyf,gt its arguably the simplest language to learn  it has a lot less depth than other common languagesI dont think thats true. It has pointers OOP user defined types everything you could want really... Just most people dont ever end up using them. ,fortran,d5hoxx9,2,t5_2r5uf
