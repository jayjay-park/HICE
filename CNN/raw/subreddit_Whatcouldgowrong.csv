Get distance wait for it to fall back down hit head with stick or rock.Bucks will fuck your shit up though IF they choose to use their horns. They can push a lot harder than you can even if you use something to block their horns. I suggest a thick wooden round shield at least cm across with a two foot mace to swing over the top.Source Canadian asshole who hates deer and medieval reenactor.Also to get deer out of the road flash high beams honk your horn swerve at them and loudly rev your motor.

They do take serious hits serious falls get serious injuries.No matter how much you practice power bombing from the top ropes both performers take a great deal of damage from the move. So.. the stories fake the wrestling isnt MMA but its still a very physical painful sport.

1559588,0,t1_cjbrn3h,ampampamp Lynching of Jesse Washington sfw gtgtJesse Washington a teenage AfricanAmerican farmhand was lynched in Waco Texas on May   in what became a wellknown example of racially motivated lynching. Washington was accused of raping and murdering Lucy Fryer the wife of his white employer in rural Robinson Texas There were no eyewitnesses to the crime but during his interrogation by the McLennan County sheriff he signed a confession and described the location of the murder weapon.gtWashington was tried for murder in Waco in a courtroom filled with furious locals. He entered a guilty plea and was quickly sentenced to death. After his sentence was pronounced he was dragged out of the court by observers and lynched in front of Wacos city hall. Over  spectators including city officials and police gathered to watch the attack. There was a celebratory atmosphere at the event and many children attended during their lunch hour. Members of the mob castrated Washington cut off his fingers and hung him over a bonfire. He was repeatedly lowered and raised over the fire for about two hours. After the fire was extinguished his charred torso was dragged through the town and parts of his body were sold as souvenirs. A professional photographer took pictures as the event unfolded providing rare imagery of a lynching in progress. The pictures were printed and sold as postcards in Waco.gtAlthough the lynching was supported by many Waco residents it was condemned by newspapers around the United States. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman to investigate she conducted a detailed probe in Waco despite the reluctance of many residents to speak about the event. After receiving Freemans report on the lynching NAACP cofounder and editor W. E. B. Du Bois published an indepth report featuring photographs of Washingtons charred body in The Crisis and the NAACP featured his death in their antilynching campaign. Although Waco had been regarded as a modern progressive city the lynching demonstrated that it still tolerated racial violence the event was nicknamed the Waco horror. The city subsequently gained a reputation for racism but city leaders prevented violence on several occasions in subsequent decades. Historians have noted that Washingtons death helped alter the way that lynching was viewed the publicity it received curbed public support for the practice which became viewed as barbarism rather than as an acceptable form of justice. In the s and s some Waco residents lobbied for a monument to the lynching an idea that has failed to garner wide support in the city.gtgtImage i  Washington hanging from a tree after being severely burnedInteresting Lynching | W.

1684856,0,t1_cjrae9c,While its true that you should only ever draw your gun if youre facing a legitimate threat and ready to immediately shoot that doesnt mean you HAVE to shoot.  The idea behind arming yourself is to stop the threat.  If this means you have to shoot then you shoot.  If the threat backs down retreats etc they are no longer a threat to you and you dont have to shoot.Example  Guy pulls you into an alley puts a revolver to your head.  You push him away and draw he points it back at you.  Shoot.Example  Guy pulls you into an alley puts a revolver to your head.  You push him away and draw he drops his gun.  No need to shoot.Getting the drop on someone so badly that they retreat means that the gun did its job and you didnt even have to pull the trigger.  This is a GOOD THING.  Just because you have something that you can kill with doesnt mean you should be looking for an excuse to legally kill someone.  ,Whatcouldgowrong,cjrjfwh,2,t5_2x2oy

They looked right and saw  cars coming.  After the rd car passed them they pulled out believing the left lane to still be clear.  But since the motorcycle was riding so quickly the lane was no longer clear and the driver crossing the intersection never waited to sufficiently determine if the lane was clear.Im basing this off of the fact that there are no other cars ahead of the motorcycle in the lane hes traveling in.  There is also a line of  cars of oncoming traffic and you can see the car pulling out right after the rd car cleared the intersection.,Whatcouldgowrong,cofhbkv,2,t5_2x2oy

The motorcycle just needs a counterexpert to say that the human eye is capable of realizing the speed and reaction speeds allow for the vehicle driver to have percieved the danger.Now you have a question of fact and require a jury or bench trial.

Police dont go around shooting everyone they get into chases with. gtNow if the cops are willing and allowed to shoot me i agree i wouldnt want to escape the police. US guncarrying level is just higher and everyone has to deal with it i guess.Now I am a legal concealed carry weapons holder and carry very very often. I can tell you from firsthand experience that the police arent the least bit worried about me and my gun. While they make take precautions at a stop they never draw when I get pulled for speeding in fact hardly anything changes except for an additional exchange of my Firearms license.What they are concerned with is people who are illegally carrying firearms weapons which is just as likely to occur anywhere else in the world as it is in the majority of the USA. The fact that we have a higher percentage of the population legally carry weapons is not the issue. Its the fact that there are no matter how many those who illegally do so which happens everywhere from France to Mexico.,Whatcouldgowrong,coz1rwx,6,t5_2x2oy

Its confusing and poor communication to use the same word to describe both a singular person and a group of people.I agree that English needs a gendernuetral pronoun. It used to be him but the meaning of that is becoming more and more malespecific and I think thats okay. Ideally I think we should use a genderneutral pronoun thats native to the English language like ou or a.

Thats because the pocket pistols have less mass so the force of the cartridge has a greater effect on them.A general rule of thumb is the smaller the gun the less pleasant its going to be to shoot.   A  is an example of the other side of this coin.   Theyre big all metal and heavy.

We are perfectly capable of helping each other out charity and we dont need to the government to sort it out for us.  Single payer healthcare doesnt work and people like you pretend it does.

6865271,0,t1_d0uhehr,gtYou obviously know nothing of the situation let me see you back away from someone who is already right next to you aside from sprinting away faster than they can get you the distance does not matter most firearm attacks occur within  feet anyway so range difference is a non issue.If they are right next to you a gun is still more deadly. If they are further away only the gun is. That is why one is called a firearm and the other a knife.gtWe cannot keep people from being violent so idk why you referred to that.Because you said violence was a problem but did not give a way to reduce violence. You brought it up. Regulating firearms will prevent violent people getting their hands on weapons and thus prevent them from committing violent acts.gtDo you think criminals are trained? If anything responsible gun owners are trained better. Every one I know that carries trains regularly and Is very well trained in the manipulation of a firearm under stressful conditions do you think criminals run failure drills with each other?A gun owner even if trained with proper firearm use has never been in a situation where someone is literally shooting at them and other people with corpses littering the area. There is a big difference between someone practicing on a static target in a sheltered environment and an actual combat zone.gtFirearms are far from unregulated no it is not hard to acquire one as long as you are legally allowed but saying they are completely unregulated is idiotic.In many cases you can get them with very little regulation and private sales require no checks. Some US states dont even have strict enforcement of checks. gtAnd let me see you not shoot yourself while struggling with someone trying to stop you I would be far more worried about a knife flailing around cutting me causing me to back away giving them the distance they need to cause a more severe wound. Meanwhile a gun can be completely disabled in  steps.So no situation is unique? Just having a firearms training course doesnt make you a martial artist who can disable a man with a gun.gtYou obviously know nothing about firearms their workings how easy it is to cause a malfunction.Ive been shooting for the past  years.gtYes in many many cases guns make a robberymurder easier but to say that they are a cause of the event in the first place is idiotic there are plenty of cases where people have been murdered without guns.I never said they were the cause of the event.

Its a road with a MPH limit and theres this big scurve with a crosswalk in the middle at the time it was the only crosswalk for about a mile and it took forever for the light to change. This kid and his friend were on Razor scooters and tried to cross against the light when a woman in a Jeep hit him straight on the friend said hed seen the car but the other kid didnt and just jumped right in front of it.

7126432,0,t1_d1o6jv3,Its deadly force and its necessary in such situations. Were not talking about beating up unarmed citizens were talking about an armed gunman who has just fired with no hesitation. What should the officers do? Try to approach the shooter and needlessly risk their own lives? Good look getting anyone to be a cop with the well even if theyre trying to kill you you have to follow these rules. Should they have retreated? Good luck having an effective police force when the playbook for a dangerous situation is Run away.Those are really the two options without deadly force. And whats the difference between shooting the guy and running him down with a car? The end result for both is about the same maybe even a little less likely to end in death when running them down with a car. Its like the old why didnt they aim for a leg argument. Sure getting out of the car and approaching the guy with weapons drawn and hitting him with a shot that will take him down and not kill him is a nice thought but its also wildly unrealistic and puts lives in danger that didnt just make the choice to fire a gun off to god knows where as a warning shot. But maybe it just isnt as shocking to me given that I live in a place where Im just as able to use such a force against a deadly threat without legal repercussions and were still a fairly civilized place that hasnt turned into a lawless wasteland. That guy made his choice by firing that gun to put everyone else in further danger and put rules on everyone else as a convenience for him isnt right to me. Hitting him with a car is no less civilized than opening fire on him which I also think would be acceptable force in this situation only probably a little more dangerous for everyone.Shitty situation sure but one person made it that way and hes the last one that needs to be considered when theyre figuring out how to end it.,Whatcouldgowrong,d1o6zd6,3,t5_2x2oy

The animal itself produces no toxin but these symbiotic bacteria they help break down food as well do the job for the lizard  if it bites anything and it gets away it aint going very far before septic shock renders it immobile. ,Whatcouldgowrong,d1w89u5,-35,t5_2x2oy

Some of my Cali friends told me I should wait a few seconds for the people who inevitably run the red light and my response was something like fuck em if they hit me its their fault. About a year later I had a good friend who ended up in the hospital because he got tboned by someone who ran their red light. I know it was the other drivers fault but that didnt really console my friends family or our friends. He was still in that shitty situation.Lesson learned Always account for other idiot drivers whenever possible.,Whatcouldgowrong,d58ssr6,50,t5_2x2oy

We have tazers and guns in Canada but most confrontations exactly like this would have resulted in a stern verbal exchange and a possible take down. The concept of the tazer really comes off as a deescalating device for unpredictable suspects etc. It seems like it was not necessary here and to suggest otherwise doesnt mean people are out of touch with reality.

Granny responded to being grabbed. The grab may or may not have been a response to something else physical but from what we can see granny is the first one physically assaulted.Edit I dont think people understand what the WCGW in the title of this sub means.It means that the subject did something stupid and was to stupid to see that the only possible outcome was negative. As if they could only foresee something goof happening. For example someone jumping off a roof with a homemade parachute.OP has posted a gif saying that Granny shoves Somebody younger and stronger. WCGW? which implies granny instigated the physical fight with a younger stronger woman and should have known that it would end poorly. At least from the part of the gif we can see grannys shove didnt instigate the fight. The younger lady made things physical by grabbing granny. Its possible this was preceded by something else physical but at very least it is clear that granny doesnt just shove the young lady out of the blue to start a physical fight. a physical fight was already escalating whether the young ladys grab was the first physical act or not.,Whatcouldgowrong,d7733fe,-11,t5_2x2oy

You cant say anything about it one way or the other.Again you cant punch people for being dumb and yelling at least legally. It doesnt matter if the situation is dangerous because it is the cops job to deal with those types of situations. It still makes no sense to just get up or even to engage the person at all.

This only happened because he changed across two lanes quickly then attempted to pass on the right. So there are two separate reasons why this wouldnt happen to just anyone. . Had he not passed on the right this would not have happened.. Had he not blindly started his pass before being able to see that the road was clear this would not have happened.

A fair number of them do large groups too which can be OK but I can guarantee that it is a lot harder to spot someones bad form when theyre mixed in with ten other people.  There is also this culture of having a fixed workout for everyone instead of individualized attention.  Workout of the Day  And on top of that they always do some weird or stupid exercise that really should either not be done at all or only done by people who have had a lot of experience.So in a couple of ways you have a perfect combination of factors that lead to injuries.

10022743,0,t1_dbdw4th,I am a Muslim I doubt thats a Muslim country. I see a lot of hate without justification. Let me explain. In Islam dogs are not allowed to be kept inside the house. Its true that we believe angels dont go were try are dogs or pictures hanging etc. Dogs are allowed for purposes of guarding hunting and other purposes where they become a necessity. Its true that due to the prohibition most people have an innate fear of dogs. But to mistreat any animal even a dog is expressly forbidden in Islam. I will give you  famous stories based on this. Once a very sinful person was in a very hot area and very thirsty. He saw a well and climbed down to get water to drink. On coming out he saw a thirty dog and went back down collected water in his leather socks and gave the dog to drink. Because of this one act Prophet Muhammad on whom be peace said that the man was forgiven all his other sins and admitted to paradise. The other story is about a very pious woman. She used to pray and do everything good except treat her cat cruelly. She had kept the cat but wouldnt feed it and would tie it so that it couldnt go look for food. Because of this torture he said that she lost all her good deeds and would be a person of hell.In Islam the nose and mouth area of the dog is what is considered as not clean. If it touches any utensils than they need to be washed thoroughly.,Whatcouldgowrong,dbdzp1v,74,t5_2x2oy

10024827,0,t1_dbe8cvo,Those are Muslim states not Islamic States. Islamic state died with the caliphate. Islamic state relies on the laws of the Quran and Hadith to rule. Muslim States combine what they want from the religious scripture and their own agenda and interpretation. Its an unfortunate situation that we Muslims have no control over. What are they doing towards the suffering of those in Aleppo or in so many other parts of the world where Muslims are suffering yet they spend millions on their luxury. What Islam is that. True Islam gives women do many rights that it feels women have more rights than us men. Take for example the dowry in many cultures. In Hinduism its the girl that gives the boy and his family the dowry. In many African cultures its the man and his family who gives the family of the girl the dowry. In Islam its not called dowry but a gift called Mahr and its given by the boy to the girl for getting married. Its hers to do what she pleases. I gave my wife a golden necklace as her gift. This is a must. Similarly they are so many misconceptions on the role of women that it makes us sad to see how distorted the facts are.,Whatcouldgowrong,dbe9gzr,1,t5_2x2oy

When everybodys freaking out cuz theres blood or stitches will be needed be the calm one... look him in the eye and tell him everything will be okay.    If its someone elses kid and their parents is freaking out do the same thing. If the parents screaming and crying get them away from the kid after you let the kid know everything will be okay then keep trending to them.,Whatcouldgowrong,ddzw9ql,1,t5_2x2oy

Example you get pulled over for speeding. Cop comes to your window. You tell the officer you have a gun on you you declare this asap a good way to piss off a cop is a surprise handgun.  of the time the officer will say thats fine let me see your license and registration. You get your speeding ticket and go on your way. If they ask to take your weapon depending on where it is they might need to pull you out of your car etc. and its a headache for both of you.If the police officer asks you to get out of the car and asks to take your weapon they have that authority during the stop. Most of the time the officer will take the weapon while your hands are up or against a wallcar but Ive been asked to hand it to them before.Thats how it works in my state at least.

Youre literally  wrong except in the case of Norway Venezuelas use of expropriation price controls and state ownership over the food supply certainly does not resemble Sweden Denmark Ireland and Finland. Thats a delusional remark. I think you might be confusing social welfare with market socialism?gtAccording to economist ngel Alayn the Venezuelan government has direct control over food distribution in Venezuela and that the movement of all food even among private companies is controlled by the government. Alayn states that the problem is not distribution however but production since nobody can distribute what is not produced Expropriations performed by the Venezuelan government resulted in a drop in production in Venezuela. According to Miguel Angel Santos a researcher at the Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University as a result of expropriations of private means of production since  production was destroyed while a wave of consumption based on imports occurred when Venezuela had abundant oil money. With poor production and a dependence on imports the drop of oil prices beginning in  made it impossible for the Bolivarian government to import necessary goods for all Venezuelans.,Whatcouldgowrong,dgmqief,27,t5_2x2oy

11767981,0,t1_dgttuxx,In my jurisdiction Quebec Canada the waiver and your signature on it are meaningless. This is article  of our civil codeA person may not exclude or limit his liability for material injury caused to another through an intentional or gross fault a gross fault is a fault which shows gross recklessness gross carelessness or gross negligence.He may not in any way exclude or limit his liability for bodily or moral injury caused to another.The second paragraph is the important one. It clearly indicates that you can never limit liability for any kind of bodily injury which is exactly what a waiver is intended to do. People still make me sign waivers when I go to play paintball even though I tell them it has no legal effect. I assume they do it so that people who are ignorant of the law just think to themselves well I signed the waiver guess I cant sue.,Whatcouldgowrong,dgtxjcc,1,t5_2x2oy
