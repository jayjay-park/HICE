6464490,0,t1_cznwqft,Im sorry but Im going to have to agree with bourbonhunter on this one... for a couple of reasons and from my professional experience in web development. If this was IG the domain name would not have been registered today. This was my first red flag. Why would the production team risk this clue being screwed up by registering it the day the clue is discovered? You plan ARGs out months in advance you dont do it last minute as clues are discovered. You risk breaking your own ARG by doing that. Youre gonna tell me they contacted John Goodman had him put on this tshirt and took a picture so they could make a website last night? Come on. And if the theory is they already knew what domain name they were going to use why would they risk registering it later? They could have planned it all out and then the domain is snatched by a domain squatter last minute.. The website uses bootstrap for its theming so designwise that completely removes that time to take developing that portion.. It would take a web developer less than  hour to develop this site. It is lit an index page with the images a jquery POST to chat that returns  is password is wrong. The check is most likely just a simple if statement checking if the phrase submitted is accurate or not. Legit its probably less than  lines of code.. The ip address of the website is owned by DigitalOcean. You can quickly spin up a server with everything you need to rock a small website in no time at all. Lit  seconds to spin up and just connect via SFTP and drop in your files.I highly doubt this site is IG. I honestly dont see any evidence to prove otherwise. The Tagruato site is ingame for sure but what evidence is there that this ingame? Besides his tshirt this is a pretty big stretch.

6601350,0,t1_d01zj11,The satellite seen at the end of the movie which was of course footage taken at Coney Island weeks before the night of the attack was identified as being Japanese military in the blu ray extra stuff. It said that Tagruato was assisting the military in finding it but that the search for it was suspended indefinitely after the attack on Manhattan. My thought is that the satellite contained some evidence of the LSA or Tagruatos actions prior to the attack. Actually if we go back to the manga CloverfieldKishin it makes perfect sense that the satellite contained footage of the Kishin attack in Japan since the manga is supposed to be in universe.  It may come back into play in some way but I believe that the main connection of these two films will be mutation caused by seabeds nectar. ,10cloverfieldlane,d024twt,2,t5_3bw30

This is less about coming up with theories and more about just waiting for information to be released. And now we have a group of people controlling the information they deem is worthy to know. I havent seen ANY pictures of the locker Paris bag or phone. I saw it briefly on the twitch stream which I had to turn off because I found it extremely disappointing in the way it was being handled. I just really feel like everyone feels worthless and its not a good feelings. It feels like there are teams now and people forming an alliance to hold information to themselves. Yet they claim they arent moderating or stopping anyone from participating. But then turn around and withhold information.Now. On the other hand I can understand not wanting to fill up the voicemail of the phone number they have to call. They have a lead and dont want to ruin it. They are being cautious and I appreciate that.But overall I just feel helpless and annoyed and feel like Im just going to have to read about what came of this later on. Further is sets a dangerous precedent. What if the information they get from calling this number isnt shared because they want to investigate it first? Obvious the GameMasters could make it public eventually but the people who control the phone could now potentially control the ARG. That is a scary thought and really annoys me.

6875674,0,t1_d0vnhir,Okay follow me here. On the radio in Michelles car there was  a annoucement that all of the southern coast was suffering thru a massive blackout of unknkown origins. It was just before the  car crash.   Howard strikes me as someone who would have a radio or scanner or both in his car as he had one in the  bunker.   At about the sametime Emmit saw the red flash that may or may not have been what was causing the blackout or may have been a city being destroyed.  Also remember Howard said he was rushing back to the bunker cause he knew something was going down. Emmitt also mentioned that he got to the bunker just as Howard was locking it. So it would put that almost exactly into the same timelines. Its what also made me wonder if Howard was telling the truth that it was an accident since he was rushing to get home and Michelle was looking at her phone.  Think its safe to assume Howard and Emmitt seprately knew what was going down  its why i havent been able to get a read on exactly why  the accident occured. I know all signs point to an abduction but i wonder if it was a legit accident since Howard said he was i  a hurry to get back home and Emmit showed up there about the same time. Also i dont think it was a random radio broadcast i think it foreshadowed what was coming,10cloverfieldlane,d0vo69c,1,t5_3bw30

Like the Halloween Movies or Nightmare on Elm Street those movies all start out like oh this mysterious monster man but then after  movies the same old killer kind of gets old.Im really happy they went this direction instead of just sticking to Giant Monster Movies.  I like the idea of different horrormonster movies with a unique spin on the way its told as the theme for the Cloverfield anthology.gtlesves a lot of questions most likely unansweredI always felt that is the soul of Cloverfield  I like that the writers and directors dont feel like they have to spoon feed everything to me and give definite answers.

If he want to have Michelle be dependent on him and to trust him killing Howard just out of the blue would blow it.Your presenting bad people as if they are completely open and evil all the time.  Some people like to hide who they really are and get off on it realizing they are doing the evil thing ruins the game for them.gtsimply stem from the fact that the film emphasizes that Howard is too large to fit through the air ventilation shaft.....They really dont thats just a backing point.,10cloverfieldlane,d0zrqmp,1,t5_3bw30

6964639,0,t3_4b3mto,I was thinking about this myself but it depends on where the gas station is.  I dont know that area but its plausible that station is on a road that runs perpendicular to their destinations so theyd both have to head that way to reach their respective routes and Howard hit her before her turn to head north.Not that Howard probably didnt hit her intentionally but its plausible their routes overlapped for a bit before diverging in different directions.

6982667,0,t3_49w717,Really loved the movie all three of the main characters were great and the story really had me on the edge of my seat. I do believe the ending was pretty crappy I dont mind the aliens I just wish they handled it differently. The Molotov cocktail taking down the whole alien ship was a little strange and I started cringing at the whole atlantaLouisiana thing or whatever was at the end. Seemed too obvious that it was some sort of set up for a sequel. Im still not sure if this film was shot as ValenciaThe Cellar and when things went weird with that Paramount division they decided to retool the movie and change the ending to make it related to Cloverfield. I also just didnt like the direction of the new aliens and what not. I really liked the idea of a huge Godzilla like monster now it seems like this is going to be some sort of war of Aliens vs. Humans and it just seems strange. Plus I really think they missed out not informing us more about Howards background and how hes related to the original Cloverfield attack. Also the house address being  Cloverfield Lane still makes no sense to me. Was it public knowledge that the tape or whatever was known as Clovefield? If so it seems strange that his address would be named after that and if it wasnt public knowledge its evens stranger because the government would be like what the heck....,10cloverfieldlane,d17tots,0,t5_3bw30

This created some major continuity errors honestly. This could possibly be explained by some sort of time distortion caused by the Flash of Light though which is what I am leaning towards...I personally think the events in God Particle will be what causes the flash of red light and possibly throwing earth into another dimensiontesseract which could then explain how Cloverfield and CL are of the same Universe but not on the same Timeline.,10cloverfieldlane,d1quccl,2,t5_3bw30
