1684105,0,t3_2dko3a,I remember watching an episode of River Monsters where Jeremy goes to catch one of these.  He had to drop the line so deep that it took a half our just to reel it up to check the bait.They also said that the meat is very toxic but it can be edible depends on what you consider edible by fermenting the meat by hanging it out in the open for  months.  End product is Hkarl an Icelandic delicacy.  It apparently tastes like rotting fish marinaded in piss due to the high concentration of ammonia in it.,Creatures_of_earth,cjrg0j3,2,t5_331bl

9690126,0,t1_da7i6mb,This is close the leopard is another predator that punches above its weight and left a deep mark on our psyche but youre misreading the rd hint.The skull in question isnt Lucy and while it was formerly thought a leopard killed the owner of that skull an Australopithecus it has been shown it was something else...Try revisiting that bird of prey option....,Creatures_of_earth,da7ihg5,3,t5_331bl
10609193,0,t1_dd9pfnw,Could have fooled me!But more seriously I know as an enthusiastic amateur about the latest developments that theropods and related dinosaurs and potentially unrelated dinosaurs being feathered and plumed and all that.But I guess its exciting to see evidence that it really was a world of giant dangerous looking birds. Just imagining that landscape in this light is so beautiful.,Creatures_of_earth,dda99jr,2,t5_331bl

11190486,0,t1_df0eru9,As you say in the post shifting baselines and whatnot.  Throughout most of the current paradigm of species knowledge their range would be limited to basically only Asia and ever reducing at that.  Its also partly just because I think of the main two wild dog species that I know of as African and Asian.  No different to say Cheetahs though. Most people would say they were African not that it needs to be specified in their name but they used to spread across most of Asia and there was a different genus in America too. Shifting baseliness my friend just one of many issues with restoration ecology and ecology as a whole!,Creatures_of_earth,df0fflz,3,t5_331bl
