8137,0,t3_1u7j8k,Its personally easier for me to say what NOT to skip. The parts I dont mention are recommended viewing but can be skipped IMO if time is of the essence.For CLANNADDo not skip Fukos arc the first  episodes. It introduces us to the important players and its a really good arc. Do not skip Episode  through  as its essential for setting up the After Story.For CLANNAD AFTER STORYDo not skip Episodes  through . Its a really important part of the story IMO and really gets the ball rolling on the After Story.Do not skip Episodes  through . Without spoiling just dont. This is what makes CLANNAD what it is.,Clannad,cefd2ct,1,t5_2soqc

1864099,0,t3_2fven3,The way I see it is like it or not Clannad isnt a tragedy. The show is about life lessons providing a look at life in its true beauty. The deaths werent there to make it a tragedy. They were there to support the theme that they drilled into our mind again and again to hold onto love through anything and to not regret what made you what you are today. Were the anime to end in the snow the show would end as something that it wasnt. Plus the illusionary world would have no purpose no reason to flash to that every time so you would have to scrap the whole idea keep in mind Clannad is a supernatural anime its in there and deserves to be there.Not to mention that they showed the first illusionary world scene in episode . Yes episode . and they flashed to it every few episodes all throughout the anime. It isnt a cop out or deus ex machina if it was a feature there the whole time. Just cause you have to think and interpret doesnt mean its a trash concept.,Clannad,ckdtha9,1,t5_2soqc

2328583,0,t3_2lz18a,Interesting. The Japanese in the title roughly translates out to On a slope to watch light but Id have to look up the Kanji on that one.

2680412,0,t1_cn8g4gh,Yes every route. By that I mean you will get light orbs at certain scenes and when you get a certain number by finishing every route and finishing Misaes before Tomoyos route you will be able to choose After Story from the menu.If you dont want to go through all that you should use a walkthrough but still read the stories because the VN is better in that regard.,Clannad,cn8g8am,3,t5_2soqc

5795961,0,t3_3uguu3,I found it from ranimes recommendation list as Id been wanting to get into anime. Id been a casual anime viewer watching stuff on Adult Swim every now and then. I found it on Hulu and watched a few episodes. I was hooked. Id never seen anything like this. I wouldnt have really gotten into sliceoflife stuff as Id been more into science fiction anime. It seemed kinda like indie anime somehow. Ive never had a work of fiction capture my imagination the way CLANNAD has.Id been looking forward to playing the original VN as someone who grew up on both pointandclick adventure games and Choose Your Own Adventure books. I missed the Kickstarter but snapped it up on Steam as soon as it became available. Im glad that it got so popular on Steam.,Clannad,cxfjkvr,1,t5_2soqc

6119454,0,t1_cyl4k0l,I see your point but since Misaes arc ends right after the dream there isnt even a chance for Tomoya to tell Misae about it. I would have to believe that he told her when she woke up. The fact that they both slept in her room that night with Misae sleeping on Tomoyas shoulder points to them ending up together just like anime spoilers when Nagisa sleeps on Tomoyas shoulder at the end of Fukos arc.I think that maybe the reason why we didnt see Tomoya tell Misae about the dream is because the implications of telling her would have extended the route quite a bit and the writers might have been running out of time. A shame really I wouldve loved to see an after story for her arc.,Clannad,cyl7voq,1,t5_2soqc

I recommend it especially if you are attached to any of the supporting characters and Im not only talking about Tomoyo Fuko Ryou Kyou etc. Im avoiding spoilers.

7482400,0,t3_4hvme0,The reason Nagisa knows about the illusionary world is because of what happened very long ago when she was about to die after being left at home alone as a child. Her dad brought her to a place where he wished for her to live on. As soon as that wish was granted the illusionary world that we see in the anime was born. Of course she doesnt have full knowledge of this but she just like Tomoya later on are linked to that world. Nagisas illness is linked to the stability of the city they live in and that city is linked to the illusionary world. Likewise Ushio is a direct product of Nagisa and Tomoya AND a direct product of the wish Akio made very long time ago so she is linked to the illusionary world as well.spoilerThe reason Nagisa knows Tomoya on the hill is because of how things played out in the illusionary world right before. Tomoya wishes that he never met Nagisa that way Nagisa wouldnt have to suffer and eventually die in the end. The scene we see with Tomoya and Nagisa on the hill is his wish in action. Just before the illusionary world comes to an end at this moment we see that Ushio is the girl in the illusionary world and Tomoya is the doll. At this moment she sends the dolls spirit to the real world and at this moment the spirit is sent to Tomoya where he wakes up and chases Nagisa. Im not  sure why Nagisa knows Tomoya but if you listen closely she echoes what Ushio said just moments earlier before to the doll. That having met him was enough regardless of how it ended.spoiler Hope this answers the question if you need to know more let me know. I think I have a perfect understanding of the relationship between the real world with the illusionary world and how they are connected to Nagisa Tomoya Ushio and Akio.spoiler,Clannad,d2spgpw,5,t5_2soqc

It has so much content that you wont feel depressed about it ending for a long time. Theres also another after story with tomoyo if you prefered her. So yeah...tons of Clannad content for you to explore. Its actually pretty rare for an anime to have this much after content in a story.
