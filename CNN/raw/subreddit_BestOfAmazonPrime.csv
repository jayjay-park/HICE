5958600,0,t1_cy0f1s0,Samsung per year compatibility is a mess not just for Amazon but for any video service. Samsung changes their software annually especially with their new push to their proprietary Tiezen system. This leave the weird situation where an app like Amazon might work on  TVs and  TVs but not  TVs. The market share is small and Ill wear it doesnt make sense to go and make a separate app for  TV sets. Yes Amazon is a complete asshole for not developing on Android tablets and phones for so many years because they wanted fire to succeed but this isnt an example of their assholery.,BestOfAmazonPrime,cy0pbse,3,t5_2ts2k
