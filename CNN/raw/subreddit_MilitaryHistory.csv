7020467,0,t3_4b62s3,Okay. Not an expert but it is a bit of Mess. South Africa is in a weird position. As colonialism is ending across Africa many diverse political factions are vying for control. Just like in Asia  South Africa is concerned initially of a domino effect. In countries like Angola and what would become Namibia. Also at this time there is civil unrest in Uganda and the Congo. So I think initially South Africa almost sees a kind of South Vietnam or Israel scenario where they will be surrounded by communist states. Then you have to factor in the civil issues in South Africa itself. With Apartheid many people part of radical political groups or so called terrorist groups were usually trained and armed by communist forces in these countries. So yes Angola was a kind of proxy war however the US was not directly involved. The Anti Communist side was directed by South Africa and Zaire while the communists were supported initially by the USSR  East Germany and Cuba  these countries actually deployed troops to the area. The US only offered political  financial and some material support. No US troops were officially deployed.So if you are South Africa you have these African Communist guerrillas trying to take control in neighboring countries who are also arming and sponsoring dissidents and terrorist groups in your own state. Then you actually have the USSR Cuba and East Germany deploying troops into Africa. A Nuclear program is a good deterrent to stop any major communist incursion into your territory. Then of course ultimately after the fall of Apartheid the Mandela Government pursues  Nuclear Disarmament.A good film would be My Heart of Darkness  A documentary that follows veterans from opposing sides as they journey back to Angola  also another good Documentary is Storyville from BBC  they did a special on Cuban involvement in Angola This is a great post as I think the Cold War and Africa is highly overlooked when it comes to Cold War history. ,MilitaryHistory,d1c4c9k,1,t5_2rlnr

8981111,0,t3_53aik2,Alright so lets clear something up. I love ancient history so Ill be going off ancient Greece and Rome. Being in the first line didnt mean death.This was mostly because casualties were light until the end. Im not a writer but Ill do my best to explain. Both guys ARE scared. Think about it if you go forward to stab someone their buddies are probably going to stab you. For the majority of men this means youd rather stick on your side than try to go stab the other guy. Youll get pokes and stabs of course but you dont enjoy going in right up to em. Add that to a strong civic value and the prestige of being in the first line you can motivate yourself well enough in the ancient world.Hours pass and everyone is tired and demoralized. I cant stress morale and energy enough it was the dealbreaker. Romans fucking feasted on this with constant rotations this is somewhat debated but the general idea is accepted and wearing down of the enemy. As a Roman soldier you knew that someone would be there to pull you out of the fight in a few minutes so you could rest. This won them many victories. Back to the scenario...your left flank has fallen and the right isnt doing well either. Its time to break.This is where the real slaughter happened. When your main line breaks and runs as they do the cavalry and bloodlust sets in. The accepted statistic is that  of casualties happen during the battle and  during the rout. Again this is why Rome was good. Especially during Caesars campaign individual Roman units were able to get out of the fight without turning and running. That covers the first line and why they did it. The next thing Ill try to cover is projectile fire. Its not my strong suit so take everything with a grain of salt but projectiles were terrifying. The reason you read about men marching through rains of arrows and javelins is because it was rare and should be recorded. People werent dumber back then they wanted to live as well. The best argument for why they did it goes back to prestige discipline and the martial cultures of the time. With your shield or on it!,MilitaryHistory,d7re4wj,9,t5_2rlnr

10123282,0,t1_dbqwyff,it would have looked like dogs flinging dirt from a distance no real finesse just getting unstuck. The stupid flotation thing on the front had our camo bag tied to it and it was buried in the mud. IIRC there were only  vehicles left alive at the end of the day and we were one of them. In the debrief the TC of the OPFOR M said he saw us dive into the trees and figured someone else would pick us off. but saw us pop back out m later after he had been knocked out and thought we were spotters. Nah just in the middle of the battlefield in a yr old sodacan surrounded by baddest MF MBTs in history. RUN MOTHERFUCKER RUN!I have pictures somewhere of us sitting on a road behind a Bradley as support with his tow launcher deployed...s later his woopielight went off and thats when we hit the gas and ended up in the middle of nomans land.It wasnt pretty but there was  s left and  Bradley so I figured it was a win for us since we had the Bradley.,MilitaryHistory,dbr2ji9,2,t5_2rlnr
