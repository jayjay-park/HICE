1303607,0,t1_cify713,I found that when handling barbarians I was able to buy any military I needed even before I started putting out caravans. The gold bonuses from city connections suited this nicely. It really took me a whole  warriors to clear out barbarians. The main reason for this is they are not re spawning my borders are expanding quickly and I take over most of the land. Any barbarians that spawn later cant penetrate past my outer cities and with the large amounts of roads I have I can react quickly to any barbarians or enemy units.,CivStrategy,cig9t7k,3,t5_32a5g

1358598,0,t3_29mgso,Pottery is almost always the best start because it opens the Shrine and Granary as well as granting access to Writing to get a library up and running as early as possible. There is also the thought that Pottery gives the best early building options while other starting techs really only give you access to worker improvements and you wont have a worker until at least turn  which gives you plenty of time to get Pottery Writing and another tech before your worker gets going. This is better than having a bunch of tile improvement options and no worker to utilize them.,CivStrategy,ciml9o4,5,t5_32a5g
1361314,0,t3_29npaj,I never puppet cities I keep. Its worth the extra initial unhappiness happiness to annex them build a courthouse and if youre still hurting buildings that will offset the unhappiness penalty.

1368958,0,t1_cinv3wp,City states will put up less of a fight on your way out of their territory so its easier to steal workers from them. Warmongering civs are probably the hardest to steal from as theyll have tons of units hanging around their base. But Id do it to Genghis and Germany too whoever is closest.One more tip! You can only declare war once on a city state civ without accruing penalties so kidnap all the villagers you can but only do it once.,CivStrategy,cinvygg,2,t5_32a5g
1485502,0,t3_2b6nwi,Culture numbers by themselves dont affect cultural victory. How much influence does civ A hold over civ B is determined by ratio of As tourism to Bs culture. Hence having more tourism than others have culture is how you aim for cultural victory. Having a lot of culture is a way to defend against it.The condition for victory itself is to be influential at least as much of tourism accumulated as their culture over all civilizations. To win culturally you need a lot of great worksartifacts buildings or wonders to put them into and move them around to get theming bonuses. Few key techs are very helpful Refrigeration for Hotels and Radar for Airport  they give a significant bonus to great works tourism and generate tourism from wonders and tile improvements culture Internet gives you a flat  boost against everybody. Its also helpful to build the Great Firewall even just to deny it to everybody else  it negates the Internet bonus for others. Declaring your religion as world one gets your holy city a  tourism boost.Tourism and culture are technically separate stats but many ways of generating one are also giving you the other so unavoidably high tourism output means high culture. Relation the other way is less clear but a civ with high culture will have at least potentially high tourism.gtAlso if some other civ is becoming influential over me does it help to even the score if I send a Great Musician to their lands?No it only affects your infuence your tourism over their culture. The opposite their tourism over your culture remains unaffected. Its not completely useless though public opinion pressure is calculated by difference in tourism alone so thats a use for it.,CivStrategy,cj2hdze,5,t5_32a5g

2544145,0,t1_cmpeskn,Hes sort of right. Im was competitive player in NQ  player FFA and you generally dont want to settle on top of stuff like horses and iron. Thats because they boost the natural yield of the tile  production. However if you settle a city on top of it you dont get that boost. So in a less you lose that  production which is huge early game.,CivStrategy,cmqnng3,1,t5_32a5g

5123143,0,t1_cv3h3zc,You want to hit Artillery as soon as possible so getting your  cities and NC are going to be a priority not necessarily an early unit count. Most people like to rush buy artillery in cities with unit xp building the second adrtillery is available upgrading catasgt cannons then upgrading is also viable if you have some easy picking city state but generally you play a sciencegrowth focused peaceful game to beeline to artillery and wipe the map before the AI has the chance to get to bombers and stop you. Some people dont really consider this a Domination game as you play peaceful for the majority...but it is what it is. ,CivStrategy,cv3j48n,2,t5_32a5g
5283142,0,t3_3nc9f3,Petra is a nice wonder and if you aim for it likely to get it in the capital city.  Personally building Petra in a city in an emperor game that isnt your capital requires it to almost always be your second city and to have decent starting production few  food  production or  food  production tiles.  I dont always require hills and oasis to built it.  sometimes the layout of the land means a city should be located in that spot and Petra takes it from bad to good but not great.I will rarely put much effort into denying Petra unless no other capital has a desert start.  AI rarely stacks cities to the extent that Petra will be as OP as it is in human hands.  their tendency to crowd cities limits the desert tiles the Petra city will have.If I spot another Petra being built in a capital and its in my second city I will abandon it.  Not worth it unless I need gold.Desert Civ isnt really needed for Petra to be OP.  Terrain matters more then the Civ.  Sure Morocco is nice but you are basically just adding  or so base gold production compared to another Civ.  You might also constrain growth by using to many of their unique improvements on tiles to be irrigated.  Morocco is nice however when there is  dozen hills without fresh waterThat trade route has a big impact on the game.  early game it can be hard to sacrifice the production to build caravans and over the full course of a game that trade slot is worth thousands and thousands of gold.,CivStrategy,cvmze1d,4,t5_32a5g

7062992,0,t1_d1gv12y,Agreed.  If you want to try it on an easier setting do it on the great plains.  One of the key things to do is to take out quadrants at a time.  This works best because it is less likely that you will be surrounded by enemies and will only need to fight on one front.Great plains is nice because it is mainly  mp per tile letting your keshiks fly around the map.  Especially when you start roading everything up.  Edit  The key thing early on is to try to get other people to war eachother first.  This makes it so everyone doesnt hate you and also depletes their military a bit.,CivStrategy,d1gy974,1,t5_32a5g
