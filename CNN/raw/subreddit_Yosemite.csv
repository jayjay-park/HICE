664982,0,t1_cgft1ek,No but a friend of a friend worked up at Tuolumne Meadows and I hung out with her twice while I was out there.  She enjoyed it.  Not to rain on your parade but just to point out some facts.  The phone signal there was little to none.  I may be wrong but I dont think youll have your car with you.  Your food choices are going to be a little limited.  What you can buy will be a little more expensive.  Its about an hour shuttle ride to the valley floor.  When the sun goes down youre out of light.  Theres probably a couple more Im not thinking of.  What Im getting at is as long as being in Yosemite for  months trumps all those then GO FOR IT!!!  Im sure some people sign up and get bored of hikes within  weeks and then sit in their room complaining about how their job sucks and theres nothing to do.,Yosemite,cgfuvz8,3,t5_2sbo4
781401,0,t1_cgss7wx,This is my first time staying at Hodgdon Meadow Campground but my second trip to Yosemite I also stayed for a week last year. The valley is beautiful but there are also great hikes outside of that area that are a less visited Wapama Falls is a nice hike the drive to Cherry Lake if you just want a nice leisurely drive is beautiful. Its also opening weekend for stream and river fishing and there are some nice rivers in that area as well.   This is a list of the hikes in the area of Hetch Hetchy There are also some places to the west of the campground outside of the park that look really nice as well I can send you more info on that later if you want. If you are looking for a great guide book I would recommend the Moon Yosemite Handbook I found it to be more informative then the Lonely Planet one. I would recommend researching before you go so you can maximize the time you have. ,Yosemite,cgt3krh,1,t5_2sbo4

Or at least this is my understanding of Reddits position based on a description passed to me in a private discussion with one of the rCampingAndHiking mods.  That still doesnt allow vigilantism witchhunts or harassment though.Keep in mind that the reason this person is all over the news is because of the original thread here and that this thread immediately devolved into a witchhunt with folks trying to track down the individual her history her location etc.   This type of thing on Reddit and elsewhere online has a history of not ending well.

5073131,0,t3_3khbd2,First make sure you come the right way. If you look at Google Maps right now itll tell you to come from Tioga Pass  Route . Do not plan on this. The Park Service does not plow  beyond a certain point and thus the road is completely closed. If you drive up  youre going to have a sad time because its a long way to drive around. Come down  up  to  and take that in and take  out to San Francisco. At least check before you start driving.Ok. So here are the options. You didnt mention a budget so Ill throw a quick summary.In the valley. Yosemite Lodge and the Ahwahnee are good. The Lodge is cheaper and nice. Both are somewhat expensive and the Ahwahnee is very nice but very expensive.Just outside the valley. Wawona Tenaya Evergreen Lodge are all also nice at various costs. They are about as close as you can stay while being outside the valley. You could also check Airbnb for spots in Yosemite West which is near Tenaya  Wawona area.Otherwise check Groveland for hotels or even hotels.com for places near Yosemite. These will be a bit farther away but probably cheaper.Lastly the cheapest is probably staying in the valley... in an unheated tent cabin. If you dont have a sleeping bag I wouldnt recommend it but I stayed there in my backpacking sleeping bag degree bag and was super warm.,Yosemite,cuxi5zl,2,t5_2sbo4

In terms of keeping and preparing food for the days youre not eating out the convenience store has both ice for anything youd like to keep cold and firewood as well as a selection of food.

One caveat  we overshot pate valley and ended up at some makeshift campsite we made about a mile past pate as a thunderstorm moved in and we lost a friend who sat down to rest from heat exhaustion. had to go back and get him as a bear circled our camp and we didnt bring tents. Long story crazy times. Ill make a suggestion. Instead of camping at glen aulin  a tourist donkey filled trap although the area is beautiful. Camp at Mcgee Lake a mile or so past glen aulin.

If you dont have a job you could hike the JMT or something like that.  You could hike the Colorado Trail too.  You could peakbag up and down  all summer.  You could do whatever you want.Being in Yosemite seems stifling to me. Unless you need the money the tradeoff doesnt seem worth it.
