5663650,0,t3_3s3jo8,I cut mine down right before it curves so they are straight nubs.Currently only using two paddles in the top slots.Was easy to do with a deremel and a metal cutting wheel  But you do need a vice to hold the piece up wear goggles and cut it somewhere where the hot metal flakes wont damage anything they land on.  A garage works good plus I have no idea if the fumes are harmful so ventilation is always a good idea.  Polishing is also a piece of cake I just used this tip  It smoothed it out extremely well took a few seconds to get the job done.I never used a dremel before if anyone has better tips have at it.,XboxElite,cwz4pzb,2,t5_3an3s
