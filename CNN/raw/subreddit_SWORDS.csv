185195,0,t1_cezbq4w,The afterblow much like rightofway before it seems to be in the weird position of being a good training tool that ends up making for awkward rules when applied to competition.Sure if theyre worth the same youre forced to defend properly after hitting. But youre also making defending in the first place less interesting than going for the hit. Hit first? Worry about defense. Hit second? Its OK you got an afterblow and it doesnt matter.If theyre not worth the same perhaps youre a bit more encouraged to care about being hit since the afterblow wont get all the points back though perhaps some rulesets could encourage baiting a lower value target if using different points for each target so you can exchange it for a higher value one.And of course no after blow leads to not caring about defense after the attack.I dont know it might be the nondeadly nature of competition that messes things up but it seems to me buffaloing ends up encouraged either way.Have you seen how it plays in tournaments with possible double elimination ie Its not about winning so much as surviving the round to few or even one hit? Its more or less what we tend to do here its actually to  points with disarms and deadly hits being  points less for others though we dont do all that many tournaments and theyre more of a training aid than something with public and all that.,SWORDS,cezj4ys,3,t5_2qt1p
229864,0,t3_1wq9u5,I think a high quality machete would better serve you for chopping up vines and brush. An authentic Japanese katana nihonto would be prohibitively expensive for that but there are a lot of options for high quality production swords made in the style of of nihonto with many of the traditional techniques but made in a Chinese forge and without the very strict and limiting regulations that Japan has on sword production and therefore at a very reasonable price. Chenness and CASHanwei both make good swords in a broad range of price and quality. They seem to be roughly comparable to each other. Cold Steel makes some extremely durable sword blades. They wont cut down trees mind you but they can take a lot of stress that many other swords in a similar price range cant. However they tend to be quite heavy and poorly balanced and I think theyre ugly as sin and sometimes overpriced. Musashi has some cheaper but still functional options. They have a line of  carbon steel blades which are differentially tempered with a real hamon for less than . They have a very similar line with more traditional folded steel also differentially tempered for more money. Their swords seem to be the most economical among functional folded clay tempered katana but they might not be quite as high quality as a chenness or hanwei. Basically what youre looking for in a battle ready sword is this Right steel. Stainless just plain wont work as its too brittle for long blades. You need a high carbon content. The basic high carbon steel range thats suitable for swords is somewhere between  and  carbon steel. The lower the number the softer the blade the less likely it is to snap and chip but it bay bend and lose its edge more readily. The higher the number the harder the steel and the sharper you can get the edge but its more brittle and may snap or chip more readily. There are other steels like spring steels such as  which has the same carbon content as  and tool steels which lend other properties like springiness and strength to the blade. Correct temper. You can have the best steel in the world and it wont matter if its not tempered correctly. Tempering is the second factor in how hard or soft brittle or flexible strong or weak the blade is and how well it takes and keeps an edge. Traditional katana and modern production swords are differentially tempered meaning the edge steel is tempered to a higher hardness than the spine steel. This way the edge can take a wickedly sharp razor edge without making the whole blade too brittle. Full tang. Swords undergo a LOT of stress. A half tang or spot welded rattail tang will snap and cause serious injury.  Correctly attached to the hilt. The blade should be pinned or riveted through the handle or bolted firmly to the pommel. Katana are always pinned through the tsuba traditionally with a bamboo pin called a mekugi. Handles that are attached with epoxy and friction will fail. The blade will fly out in a spinning helicopter of death and hurt somebody. Check Sword Buyers Guide in the sidebar theyll tell you whats what and help you avoid buying an overpriced or useless blade. ,SWORDS,cf4kn60,1,t5_2qt1p

1105764,0,t1_chts38a,As to that group please see my other post in this thread. In short stay far away.gt i would perhaps like to keep this piece after restoration and in doing so would prefer to have the mountings rewrapped into the original hilt. would you have any comment on that? for example why would one have the mountings wrapped on a tsunamiIm not following the question perfectly so let me be very specific about how this works. As I said elsewhere when the sword is repolished it is in your best interest not to return the blade to the original antique saya scabbard as old oil  dust  grime  grit  whatever will probably scratch up or mar your expensive restoration. The old saya cannot be cleaned without destroying the old lacquer which is obviously less than ideal. So the polisher has a shirasaya plain wooden resting scabbard made for the blade and a tsunagi wooden sword blade copy made for the koshirae. The koshirae needs something to hold it together and a wooden blade works just as well as a metal one.To restore the mounting on your sword you do not need a new tsuka core wood hilt or sam rayskin IMHO  all you need is for it to be rewrapped. In other words a tsukamakishi professional handle wrapper will remove the old silk and replace it with new silk. The core sam rayskin menuki palm ornaments fuchikashira collar and end cap etc. will all be the same.There are some other minor things that could be done like gently cleaning the red rust off the tsuba by laboriously rubbing it with a piece of soft bone. But most of the koshirae is in acceptable condition asis.Of course it is too bad that the blade cannot be returned to the antique saya after restoration. But there is no ideal solution here. Either you relacquer the old saya losing a bit of its history or you make a shirasaya and store the blade in that. You can at least mount the blade in the tsuka hilt occasionally if you want to show it off  display it just dont put the polished blade back in the old saya.Regards G.,SWORDS,chtzdk5,2,t5_2qt1p

The steel does have an even grain due to the crystal growth but thats not something thats visible like bands from alternating carbon content.

3762093,0,t3_33fat3,You seem to have already gotten a lot of good advice!  Ive been making knives for a while so let me chime in with a couple of opinions.. Start with a knife not a sword.  Heat treating is a tricky thing and a jerry rigged furnace like the one you described will be difficult to use to keep a constant temperature over a long piece of metal.  Youre talking about keeping  or more of steel at exactly the same temperature for a long period of time.  This is EXTREMELY difficult to do without proper equipment.  Heat treating a sword before youve ever even tried heat treating a knife might be biting off more than you can chew.  Youre also going to be doing stock removal by hand.  Expect to spend an hour an inch getting the shape just right between fine and rough work.  Youll probably have a much easier time starting with something smaller like a  blade or something.  Remember your blades can and will destroy themselves during the heat treat process.  Expect to break a blade or two during quench before you figure it out.  Id hate to see that happen to a beautiful sword that youve already put  hours into.. Buy knife steel.  Dont recycle just yet.  Recycled steel is unpredictable this means theres more of a chance of it failing during heat treat.  Do yourself a favor and get a nice piece of steel.  As long as were talking about nothing over ft youre looking at no more than  for a nice piece.  I use www.usaknifemaker.com.   Maybe look at ftx.xin of  or w?  Those are nice beginner steels.

Its really only the lengthened quillon block and upturned guard that key into that aesthetic.  The branches on the finials the latheturned pommel the swelling bare wood handle stepped blade profile and overall compressed dimensions this is a very small sword borrowing the appearance of very large swords are all disparate elements that dont align with any sword that would have appeared historically.

4516997,0,t3_3cxoti,It looks like a French Briquette. They were used Napoleons army and they were not well liked. They were cheaply made unbalanced and usually blunt. They didnt see much combat use but soldiers found two better uses for them. One was to split firewood and kindling which is how it got the name briquette which is french for kindling or a lighter. Second they were famously used for opening champagne bottles that soldiers liberated. This is still a technique thats done today in fancy restaurants and hoitytoity parties called sabering a champagne bottle. The blunt edge is slid along the length of a bottle and the blade sharply strikes the lip at the neck of the bottle. The force of the impact combined with the force of the pressure inside the bottle causes the glass to fracture in a clean ring around the neck of the bottle and the cork and glass ring go flying off in a shower of champagne. Its messy but its an impressive display.Despite the fact that these were terrible and wildly unsuccessful swords in their day their association with sabering bottle shad made them popular and there are a lot of reproductions on the market. ,SWORDS,ct00f8m,7,t5_2qt1p

4854747,0,t3_3hcxyz,swords are a great allaround sidearm which is why they were in use for so long across so many cultures. They are the longest effective weapon better reach than a mace or dagger that doesnt require two hands and can be worn on the hip for travel unlike a polearm which in most other ways is superior for open battle. someone who carries a hammer or mace is expecting to get in very close to lots of people in armor and against an unarmored man with a sword will be at a huge reach disadvantage. so people in armor would carry such weapons in case they met one another but thats also just one more freaking thing weighing you down in a hot and exhausting battle. soldiers carry a lot of crap but never want to carry more than they need. Axes tend to be cheaper than swords so they are more of a budget weapon than a really good one. The time where you will be very glad you brought a mace is when you are in armor and meet another man in about equal armor who has a sword you might be able to get some really good bone breakingkilling blows before he finds an opening. but youd have to get all the way across a battlefield to meet another knight in full plate and a mace alone wont help against spearmen or the like which make up the bulk of infantry. ,SWORDS,cu6h6uy,5,t5_2qt1p

LeGuin      gtThis is a bronze sword I made for the upcoming exhibition The Sword Form and Thought at the Deutsches Klingenmuseum in Solingen Germany. It is one of four swords in a part of the exhibit called Xiphos penetrating light. Four other smiths and I were invited to create contemporary sword artifacts which explored the idea of penetrating light.    gtPictured is a slideshow of the making of this sword. Thanks to Green Foundry for casting the blade and hilt scales.     gtWhen cocurator Peter Johnsson described the idea to me one of my first thoughts was Ursula LeGuins poem Only in Silence the Word which describes the relationship between apparent opposites. I made this sword as an exploration of the idea that darkness is the context in which light exists  one implies the other. It seemed to me that the best representation of both light penetrating darkness and the integral relationship between light and darkness was to cast a bronze sword. The bronze penetrates the darkness of the mold as a glowing liquid matter that is light incarnate. The mold shapes the liquid bronze into a sword just as darkness gives context to light.     gtI was partly inspired by the huge Bronze Age swords which may have been altars. There is one at the British Museum as wide as a mans chest as long as his legs with no hilt. I wanted to make a sword that pushes the boundaries of size a sword for an oakskinned Bronze Age hero a sword which holds the spirit of light in its pommel is sharp and balanced its blade a golden line of intent.    gtThe opening of the exhibit will be on September th  for more info have a look here The Sword  Form and Thought I hope to see you there!    gtJake Powning,SWORDS,cv4w8kt,15,t5_2qt1p

Then try and get a sharp weapon that has as close as possible statistics to your training weapon.  There are a lot of different kinds of swords which feel very different in the hand under the category of longsword.  Yes techniques do transfer between variants quite easily but when youre just learning why complicate things.  Get a sharp that has a similar length weight and blade attitude to your blunt training weapon.  If you get a feder this is a good plan for training you can still get a weapon with a similar blade and handle ratio.  ,SWORDS,cv5zmmt,2,t5_2qt1p

Emerson amp Silver were a manufacturer of swords during the war and the blade and markings are suitably worn that I could believe its the real deal.What makes me think it might not be is that its utterly dull which might be understandable given its age and that it has a red tassel tied to the hilt which I cannot imagine is an original accessory...  Also both of my grandparents immigrated to the US in the late s so there is no chance anyone in the family actually fought in the war amp this belonged to them.Im not trying to sell it Ive just always thought this was a fucking cool thing to own!

5629967,0,t1_cwut7ib,The thinner a blade is the easier time it has cutting. But since it will be more flexible it can have a harder time thrusting.For thrusting you want a rigid blade especially for penetration against mail or some other armor you can actually get through which on the extreme would be an Ibeam shape but that would lack edges which also aid penetration so you get compromises like fullers diamond or concave flats.The specific performance is hard to tell with just that though. You could have a very flat diamond cross section or a very thick lenticular one and theyd behave more or less the opposite of what you expect though theyd probably be suboptimal or end up resembling a more optimal shape.Instead of going for cross section we could say that roughly thicker means more thrust oriented while wider means more cut oriented. So a fully square estoc vs a flat diamond longsword for example.Oh and thats missing triangular blades for the most extreme example.,SWORDS,cwuy90g,6,t5_2qt1p

No steel is naturally black they are perhaps unsurprisingly steelcoloured. a greywhite metal. Blacking is an oxide surface layer which is applied to polished steel either in the form of an acid or as an application of heat over an oiled surface. the latter method is more historical but is less reliable both in terms of quality of coverage and in terms of durability of the steel underneath getting it hot to blacken it gets it close to being overheated which softens the blade.Generally speaking any carbon steel can be blacked. for a sword   EN or similar carbon or spring steels all blacken well and all produce excellent blades.  ,SWORDS,d5fm3z6,11,t5_2qt1p

10885969,0,t1_de2spn9,A axe for cutting wood does have a thick heavy bit.An axe for war has a very very thin bit. original vs reproAnd yeah chopping the rigid strike with no followthrough is generally something not done with swords because youre attackign a moving target. You can do it but its hard to make a cut that isnt at least slightly a draw cut and arresting your followthrough takes a lot of energy. Its better to just transition into another guard after cutting.HOWEVER having said that all the points made about cutting power are still valid youre just using a different term to describe it. Falchion still have a lot of cutting power against unarmored targets and yes I include gambeson under unarmored.On the topic of how chopping implements work in many cases they do wedge things apart. But this is a bad way to cut even light padding like a thin gambeson as the fibres are tightly knit and you really need to shear and slice at them with something thin  you arent trying to split the gambeson youre cutting it.On the topic of mass and speed in terms of force they are proportional. But when a human has to use the a heavy weapon cannot be accelerated to the same speed so the acceleration value decreases as the weight increases unless you put in huge amounts of energy and over commit your cuts which means you wont recover in time after a cut and reduces your chance of parrying riposting or reacting to changes in the fight.In my years training in HEMA  mostly broadsword and sabre  Ive moved from cheap slightly overweight swords to my current custom made ones and one of the main features is that theyre lighter  even though Im stronger than I was before. The extra control means I can make fast cuts with equal power without risking losing the ability to recover parry or control my opponents blade.,SWORDS,de2t6e8,1,t5_2qt1p
