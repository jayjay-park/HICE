2169175,0,t1_clfjg3c,And are the businesses actually hurting? Admittedly I havent lived in st. kitts for a few years now but anytime Im down there when Im visiting family they seem just as busy they usually are. In fact the parking lot by the park has been plenty full many times. And theyre all about to benefit from pan am traffic. Whether or not the property is developed wont matter. Those people will still be visiting. ,stcatharinesON,clfjwsn,1,t5_2r8ur

7062335,0,t1_d122w9r,I know white people in St. Catharines who regularly reffer to black people as jiggaboos and nrs and arab people are terrorists and chinese and korean are always chinks.. just because this city has those races doesnt mean people arent prejudice. Ive noticed since moving here from Toronto that while other races exist here everyone seems segregated. White people stick with white people Koreans stick with Koreans Black people with black people etc. I often see diffrent races. I rarely see people of different races hanging out together.,stcatharinesON,d1gvkh1,1,t5_2r8ur
