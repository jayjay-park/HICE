5324282,0,t1_cvs841d,I posted the process here on the sub when I made my shirt The medium was acrylic paint with textile medium. I laid out the logo the way I wanted it and printed it out. I used clear repositionable contact paper placed down over the image and cut it out with an XActo knife. Then I placed it down on the shirt and applied the paint. After a few coats I pulled the contact paper off did a couple of touch ups with a fine brush and heat set the paint with an iron. ,skyhill,cvs8lzb,3,t5_2zx98
