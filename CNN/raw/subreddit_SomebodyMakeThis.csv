992741,0,t3_25ckfm,Before is shunned to oblivion hear this out some insurance companies actually have smartphone apps for proof of insurancebackup in case an insurance card is not handy so there is actually some slight thought put into digitizing personal documentation. With that in mind while this concept may work in the context of something like an insurance cardlibrary carduni id etc. things like drivers license and passport are a totally different realm. Aside from easiness to forgeduplicate its pretty easy to screw yourself into identity theft if such things are left on an easily accessible device like a phone. While it may be convenient it opens the door to all kinds of bad stuff that could happen. ,SomebodyMakeThis,chh4rc9,1,t5_2rngx

5743412,0,t3_3tt3sl,The problem is that induction charging requires the coils to be aligned with each other to fairly close tolerances. The charging coil and the device coil have to be along the same axis. If you were to make the entire pad an induction coil you would need a mouse the size of the pad or deal with tremendous losses from lots of misaligned loops. It would technically be possible to put a bunch of individual coils that detect the mouse using backscatter this is how Qi works so you only enable the coil under the mouse but that would be hundreds of times more expensive than simple contacts and a charging base.Phones get away with induction charging because we want it to work through a protective case. Mice dont have that requirement. ,SomebodyMakeThis,cx90y4i,2,t5_2rngx

6235772,0,t1_cyxxx1u,For an easier wayfor anyone reading this later on to do this in Windows  Rightclick Start Menu click on Command Prompt Admin Type the following and hit enter control userpasswords Untick the box at the top Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer and click Apply Type in the username and the password of the user you want to automatically log on. This is so Windows can store the password somewhere it can retrieve it from to run it through the login process without needing you to type it in.Plz note that convenience usually comes at a cost to security and that you are making your computer rather less secure by doing this  especially on a slower computer even if you have a startup script set to lock your session it may take a little time to fire off Windows will be busy starting all your other apps and may not get round to your startup script immediately so theres a chance to disable it before it runs. And I think Safe Mode ignores startup scripts so breaking into your computer is suddenly as easy as hitting F while its booting up.That was a security tradeoff I was happy to have many years ago when I first did this but nowadays and especially with booting off an SSD that makes this sort of thing needless I wouldnt do it myself.,SomebodyMakeThis,cyyftz2,2,t5_2rngx

8776839,0,t1_d71ynjc,Well there are solutions to pronunce text in certain languages theyre called texttospeech engines thats nothing revolutionary. Im thinking of more general applications whereas pronunciation needs to be represented as written text. Its way easier to copy a piece of text around than an audio snippet for example and it would need speakers to be present. Sound data requires digital media in general but you can write text on paper or print it in IRL dictionaries you want to distribute.Also you might think that people can easily imitate pronunciations when heard but thats not always true especially if the foreign language uses sounds you are not accustomed to. In that case it might help to see something written and trying to pronunce that even if the pronunciation would be quite off from how it should be according to a native speaker.,SomebodyMakeThis,d72ru66,1,t5_2rngx
