I started playing WoW back at launch in  raided through Sartura in AQ as Resto and OTed Patchwerk as I collected the gear because Feral tanking was always in my heart. I raided hardcore through TK in BC with a server firsttop  guild and have been semihardcore since Wrath. With the dissolution of my previous guild of six years during MoP and my enjoyment of the raids in WOD I have decided to once again dedicate myself to raiding hardcore Mythic content while it is relevant.Below you will find a list of my skillset and preferences that may assist you in assessing if synergy may be found between your community and myself.ampnbspWhat I bring to the table I am a leader that knows how to follow and that can pick up the reigns when needed and relinquish them appropriately from a  man Heroic to getting out raid invites and doing the raid comp to recruitment and managing a guild in the GMs absence. I bring experience as player Member Officer Council and GM and know the plight of each. I bring the ability to tank at the highest level of play. I bring constructive criticism and deserved praise when and where needed. I bring the pool of strategies and tactics from all bosses of WoW and many other games. I bring a love for other people and a love for teaching and helping others on and offline. I bring a love of serving others to make everyones existence better.ampnbspWhat I want and expect in a guild I choose to play with I want a long term guild association with intelligent people where long term friendships out of game can occur. I want and expect a mature environment of adults that play on time do not make excuses and strive for results. I expect my time to be valued and not squandered. I expect to be invested into and to invest into others and the guild. I expect to raid Mythics while they are relevant.ampnbspMy Availability Monday  PM   PM  Tuesday  PM   PM  Wednesday  PM   PM  Thursday  PM   PM  Friday  PM   PM  Saturday  PM   PM  Sunday  PM   PM ampnbspYou may reach me via my BattleTag or by posting in the comment section below.I look forward to speaking with you about the possibility of becoming a part of your community and raiding Mythic content with you while it is relevant.SincerelyDejableu Dejablue,wowguilds,cook3vt,1,t5_2s8h3

4108078,0,t3_37oh3x,Hola. I would be interested if we were able to get this off the ground.  This is the way I have always preferred to reroll in the past. I never have understood the mentality of people who want to do the reroll project for the intention of restarting from scratch and then just power their way to cap via LFD using heirlooms.I just feel a reroll should have a goal and intend to be social. Anyway comment back or PM me if youd like help getting this off the ground. Rerolls are not always easy to coordinate but can be so rewarding when you get the right collection of individuals.

4345890,0,t3_3aa94x,Well hello there  I see that you want to raid  nights a week in an adult environment focused on progression using epgp. I happen to have a raid that runs  nights a week with grownups focused on progression using epgp AND FB and forums to boot! See where Im going with this? D  RhawnaAtropos is a medium size Horde guild on the Whisperwind server with  Heroic and  Mythic in Foundry. We will be starting the new patch content on heroic mode. Majority of us play to raid and prefer to do it with people that we like in a reasonably laid back raiding environment. In composition the guild age range is from the s to s. There are married couples engaged couples and the forever lonely on the roster. What you wont find in guild is any passive aggressive dramatic obnoxiously immature behaviors. We dont troll alliance or trade chat or each other for that matter. That being said Atropos is out for progression. Server firsts? No. But competitive? Yes. We raid onSCHEDULETuesdays  Invites at pm combat starts at pm no late invites. Raid ends at pm server.Thursdays  Invites at pm combat starts at pm no late invites. Raid ends at pm server.Mondays Invites at pm combat starts at pm no late invites. Raid ends at pm server.All times are CST.All players with a reasonable ilvl and the desire to be on the progression team are invited to the Tuesday night raid for the farm kills. We take the logs from Tuesday and set the roster for the rest of the week based on your performance on those logs. If you do not make the cutoff for whatever reason no big deal! You are invited back the following Tuesday to soak some loot and try again. The goal is progression for the whole and we mean it. The GM has sat for performance officers have sat for performance. No one has immunity we are all treated equally. LOOTWe do use the EPGP loot system with a weekly decay set up so that new comers dont have any issues being eligible for loot right off the bat. EPGP policies are posted on our forums for details as to the amounts given and how we run it. EP is awarded for attendance bonus EP for new boss kills bonus EP for stellar performance of mechanics during progression nights and bonus EP for assisting in the guilds reg mode  group that runs on Sundays to gain gear and experience. The guild pays for repairs and provides all consumables including gems enchants potions  food runes and flasks.WHAT WE NEEDWe are looking for nice people who are driven to succeed! We need players who are comfortable and knowledgeable in their classspecs  and who take feedback gracefully. Feedback on performance is given both during raid and after via oneonone private whispers with an officer who has studied your logs. Players need to be able to respond in a positive manner to that feedback and push for improvement. If you are sat based on your log from Tuesday we are looking for players that wont rage quit the guild because of one bad log but that will look at the log objectively and work at getting better. We also need players that can consistently attend the raid times listed above and who do not have major life changes looming on the horizon ie job change that will change your availability marriage to a spouse that doesnt play cause everything changes once the ring goes on! unemployment making your ability to pay for your account a questionable variable. If all of the above sounds like a good fit for you please contact any of the following players in gameRhawnaRhawnahChaeyla  the poor fool that got suckered into GM.

8671721,0,t3_4ym211,Hi uirishrazr !ltThe Basingt has many former military personnel in it. We understand how difficult deployments can interfere with that important game time. Our message is a bit different than most Ill post it below.  I hope you find what youre looking for. ltThe Basingts roots on Alliance Stormrage date back to World of Warcrafts release back in November . We are a part of a larger community of gamers across several different games The Amazon Basin whose history dates back to Diablo II. We are looking for members to join us.ltThe Basingt is a bit different than a lot of other guilds out there. Here is a description of the guild thats pretty accurate as one of our Guild Leaders Dan Quixote posted on our forums  We are not a Hardcore Raiding Guild. We are a guild that raids maybe one or two nights a week. If you come here to raid in a more hardcore environment or more frequently than one or two nights a week I would suggest one of the dedicated raiding guilds. There are plenty of them. That being said if youre looking to be a part of a group that does raid at a more steady pace we may be the guild for you. Although some basiners are quite skilled at PVP we are NOT a PVP guild. Although some basiners are very skilled at their class in general we DO NOT nor will we ever consider someones skill level when deciding if they are a good fit to the basin. We WILL consider to a certain extent your gear and basic competence with your class before inviting you to participate in certain endgame content i.e. invites to specific raids. This is unfortunate but this is driven by the mechanics of the game. If this were not necessary it would not be so. It also doesnt affect whether you get in the guild or not. There are many of us who are more than willing to help someone gear up should they want to participate in endgame content. We value personality respect of others and friendliness well above your ability to play the game. Racial slurs griefing cheating hacking and vulgar behavior have no place in our environment. We have a great reputation on Stormrage and we jealously guard this reputation. We understand that the way we treat people OUTSIDE the guild is very important. People are not lesser than us because they choose to play the game in a way we find distasteful. They merely differ in us as to what is fun and should still be treated as human beings. These principles of ours can all be distilled down to our motto Play Nice And Show Some Class.Demographically Id guess the Basin is probably filled with more older folk than most other guilds. As a wild guess Id say average age of a basiner is  although we have many in their s and s. We do have some teens that exhibit a high level of maturity. Although we officially draw the line with a minimum age of  we honestly find that most applicants that young are not happy in the guild and are better finding a guild more in their age bracket.We believe that there are like minded folks out there who are interested in a friendly casual environment that is pushing tougher endgame content in Legion whether this is Raiding or Mythic as well as levelling alts and running mans .If you find this interesting and want to check us out further please visit us at www.theamazonbasin.com . As we are a smaller part of an overall gaming community youll note upon visiting that our forums are divided into several different game sections. To reach the World of Warcraft subforum you may have to scroll down so you can explore our section of the forums.

We have three confirmed healers two holy priests and one holy pally. We are having one holy pally that will be joining us today so seeing how that works out. We also have a mistweaver monk but he cannot raid with us due to work obligation until Feb. .  We also have five to eight dps though showing up consistently is the issue one enhancement shaman two arm warriors one cannot show up to all raid nights two ret. pallys one shadow priest and a mage. We also have another warrior and mage who are gearing up to join us for Nighthold.So either restro druid would be good or ranged dps so a moonkin.

Below is our guild information About UsOoken Dookers is a mythic progression raiding guild located on USThrall. The guild has been around since midWrath with some of the members having raided and played together since VanillaBC. The guild was created with one goal in mind to be a competitive endgame content progression guild while also allowing members to pursue real life endeavors. We believe that in order to be a high level and successful raiding guild members possess an innate competitiveness to push themselves to always be the best while also having the competitive maturity to receive feedback to improve their play. While we are generally laid back and are looking to have fun it is a game after all we do expect that raiders come prepared and ready to perform your role to the level expected of mythic raiders.We are open to trials from any player regardless of competitive raiding background. We have some players where Legion is their first experience in WoW while others who have played and raided since Vanilla. At the end of the day if you can show a consistent ability to play your class at a high level it does matter what experiences you may or may not have. In the same vein it doesnt matter if you are able to spend only  hours or  hours a day on WoW as long as you are able to perform during progression.

We have a great history on our server including  progressed horde side guild in MOP and have been nothing short of a respectful group of people for nearly  years. If you are looking for a solid group to raid with and enjoy the game in the process visit nervclan.com or message me on Bnet.Thank you  NapalmDawn,wowguilds,dgoof67,1,t5_2s8h3
