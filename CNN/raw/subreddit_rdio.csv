3973068,0,t1_cr8scuo,Im curious to know how specifically do you think the Premium product has suffered and how specifically Spotify has continued to get better.Also can you blame them for catering to free users some of them time? After all they are a business with two types of customers free and Premium.,rdio,cr95vki,2,t5_2reij
4080088,0,t1_cr5cfus,record companies corrupted Rdio which used to be a good service. Half of my prized playlists are missing songs like missing teeth. I cant get those songs back. FuckRdio,rdio,crlctdi,-3,t5_2reij
4457923,0,t1_csrb5l9,Yes. On Rdio I just wound up following the people who would comment on albums. People who write thoughtful comments are usually pretty active on the service and will lead you to other good stuff. I have no idea how to find those people on Spotify or Apple Music.,rdio,csslot1,2,t5_2reij
4816095,0,t1_cu1l4zh,Yeah  that may be the draw for some.... but that drive time chatter is exactly why i switched to rdio. Yuck. To each his own.... Now a few Sirius XM chat stations I would love to get but nothing beats being your own DJ.,rdio,cu1lwfp,1,t5_2reij

5209090,0,t1_cvdul4x,The new APP is a lot more smooth and fluid Im really liking it. Its still pretty new and they started rebuilding it from the ground up apparently so there may be a few bugs but overall Ive switched over to using it. You can sign up for it here ,rdio,cvdvz8d,5,t5_2reij
5745550,0,t1_cx3ozz2,Ok. Ive got my solution finishedSpotify has some weird limits on what you can do with their API. I cant move super large libraries  albums to completion. I can move a large bulk and give you links to open the album in the app so it can be easily added.,rdio,cx9ai8c,2,t5_2reij
