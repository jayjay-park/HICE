6169326,0,t3_3zy6wo,Try raudioengineering or one of the other audio subs. To answer your questions yes it is completely different from data cabling. Analog audio is often susceptible to electrical interference and you will want to be sure you can ensure quality sound by not running it along the same route as power.If youre running several cables in the same direction you can bundle many cables together to help with sanitytidiness. This is generally referred to as an audio mult. Audio XLR cables are indeed more expensive to make. Youll need to learn to solder. I love making them and find the process enjoyable. There are some XLR connectors that incorporate binding post connections but probably arent the most durable. Ive only seen them used in longrun temporary situations.

8291181,0,t1_d5diury,Rozakiin is correct. My source is a build that I personally did. I trusted the AIO too much and mounted it this way.

10059021,0,t1_dbipb2w,Well AMD has this wattman software that allows you to control the themal levels according to what you want.By default it goes up to C a little more than I was comfortable with so I moved it down to C. Guess what it stays at C all day.Maybe a side cooler would help bring it down a few degrees ,CableManagement,dbipqq0,1,t5_2tdv7
10294910,0,t1_dcav47p,Your hubbys a lucky lad! Im impressed with how the cabling is so clean with an AX PSU. Im using the exact same one and its a real hassle to try to flex it enough. I barley managed to get the back side case panel back on ive managed to to keep most cable alinged near the holes.Off topic but was that a ZX motherboard for his old build? Looks near like a replica of my ZXUDB. And I think ill swap out of this case near summerhopefully some new budget options will be available! Thanks for the pics as well.,CableManagement,dcazflg,2,t5_2tdv7
10297180,0,t1_dcb7dk1,Thanks for the pics man ive already got a somewhat similar setup but my pin goes through the holes at the side. Get some compressed air in there dude for shame!,CableManagement,dcb8ovw,1,t5_2tdv7
10345184,0,t1_dcggvan,The way the PSU is made is that the stickers on either side of the PSU are inverted. So if you look at a pic from the front the PSUs sticker is facing the right way but from the back its upside down. This is so the user can install it either way drawing air from the bottom of the case or from the inside of it.    I have mine drawing fresh air from the bottom of the case and expelling it out the back.,CableManagement,dcgoov4,1,t5_2tdv7
10472599,0,t3_5odqf4,Update time!So after some tinkering Ive managed to fit both the CPU amp GPU coolers in the orientation Id originally hoped for.My Ensourced cables arrived and my god they are nice. Props to Joey theyre a cut above the rest..My only issue now is one of the Hi tubes protrudes from the case  ever so slightly. When the glass side panel is attached it pushes against this tube which in turn pushes the tops of the tubes closer to the top fans and therefore makes contact with the fan closest to the front of the case. Cue horrible noise.. Im trying my best to try and work the cables into position so they sit in a position on their own accord however theyre damn strong. Ive pulled the cables down somewhat this morning and fastened a few velcro ties in the hope it will assist with this. Will see what else I can do when I get home from work this evening..Im also still unsure what to do with the pin GPU fan power cable Im hesitant to cut it off and Id forgotten to try the under the backplate trick before putting this all together.. so may need to start again just so I can hide it.Pics,CableManagement,dcv6dsl,1,t5_2tdv7
