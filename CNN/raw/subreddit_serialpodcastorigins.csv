5195944,0,t1_cvcaj1m,OK if I disregard the arms I have a photo that resembles that except my photo is cropped at the point of Haes left knee so I cant see lower leg and foot.  And I can see left arm clearly in that photo along side the body. Of all the photos I have that is the one that is most clear in showing the face chest down position and twisted torso. The sweater is folded up so that the skin is exposed from mid back to waist. That may be something that happened during the excavation process because there is no apparent moss growing on that part of the back as opposed to the legs being almost entirely covered with moss.  However in the photo Im pretty sure I can see the ridge of the spine which also confirms face down position.So basically that additional info confirms to me that  SS has seen the full face down position  and in fact if you look at the green arms it the outline the torso would have to be face down because her drawing clearly shows the left shoulder in contact with the ground.  Which it would have to be with the rock present as that rock was either right up against the shoulder or positioned in such a way that the shoulder may have been slightly pinned under the rock. ,serialpodcastorigins,cvcazx2,1,t5_39h2j

Most of the people on this sub or the others do not want to view them I imagine. Secondly the podcasters who do not represent him in any way legally have seen the photos and are interested in acquiring more. Also they are using the descriptions of these quite publicly in furtherance of their own ends. Do you not find that ghoulish as well?The original description of the photos given here severely undermines the claim that the burial position precluded the possibility that Jays testimony was accurate. There really hasnt been much interest in the photos beyond their value of possibly discrediting the misinformation that has been plaguing the various media outlets for the past year. Any perverse characterization of the people discussing the photos is wildly off the mark in my opinion.

They cannot hide behind saying ATampT should not have supplied the affidavit in that form its their fault not ours.So State can argue one of two things or both.  That the misleading affidavit and exhibit made no difference to outcome..

6068964,0,t3_3ykii1,This line of thinking leads to a ton of inaccurate generalities but one I believe is accurate is that guilters on the whole have a more abstract individualized maybe even eccentric and at times inexplicable seeming engagement with the case and the Serial reddit subs.  Adnans already in jail and the states interests will be adequately represented by the state.  Theres no need to do much organizing no need to rally troops or work like activists aside from the brief spots obtaining transcriptsfiles.  Beyond that the only throughlines I see on my side are a true crime interestobsression b skepticism about medias frameworkpresentation of events generally and in this case c desire to not let lies and inaccurate representations about the legal system drive the cultural conversation especially in terms of who is regarded as being part of a noble cause.  The last one is key as I know that many on my side are generally sympathetic to wrongful conviction cases and juvenile sentencing but are unwilling to stomach the way the rhetoric surrounding those issues has been coopted and hijacked by an unworthy sloppy and often nakedly fraudulent PR effort to freeAdnan.And though I think theres more comfort with solitary anonymity on the guilter side I dont actually think its necessarily depersonalized  in many ways Im more myself on here than I am in real life. This forum enables selfexpression and gives me more of a community feeling than most of my IRL interactions  even under the cover of anonymity.  Maybe thats somewhat unhealthy but there you go.

6105025,0,t1_cyji3n9,gt You have to draw a line somewhere.  I think part of the point is that a hardandfast line in the sand can be a bit meaningless and that the judicial system should be able to look at the individual caseperson and come to an informed decision on whether the person should be tried as an adult or as a child.  And our judicial system thankfully has that latitude.  In this case it determined that A. Syed in making the decision to murder his exgirlfriend who rejected him was acting more in the realm of adult than child.  We can disagree in good faith about whether that determination was appropriate or not but the fact of the matter is that a determination was made and that is as it should be.  I for one think that the determination was appropriate.  A man over the age of seventeen plotting over the course of days to murder a woman because he cant have her is much more in the realm of adult than child.  One can say But he wasnt yet fully an adult and the response is Our judicial system doesnt require you to have gotten a Ph. D. had ten years managerial experience at work and paid off a mortgage in order to be considered legally speaking an adult.  It simply has to make a determination regarding whether the person is more appropriately deemed in the realm of adult or child.  Its not always a determination that people will agree about but its a determination that needs to be made.  ,serialpodcastorigins,cyjkuss,5,t5_39h2j

Those filmmakers were not the first people to ask if prison made Avery a murderer. I actually think it happens all the time. Great old Dustin Hoffman movie on TCM the other night. Not the best movie in the world but good for other reasons  the acting the time it was made the cast they chose the director. Its basically one of those s message movies what today wed call concern trolling. The message in this case is that prison makes people into criminals. This has been going on a very very long time. I think Serial missed a big opportunity to talk about sentence limitations for minors.

These men though see that his family is greatly depressed and they see his sick father who might die soon and they think that he should be released because its been long enough. Not to mention the fact that the Syed family has probably been ostracized from the community and all that. In these type of close knit immigrant communities the nail that stands out gets hammered down. I mean interracial dating is a huge issue of contention many extended family members felt uneasy about both my father and his brother marrying outside the race and faith.

6724608,0,t1_d0e090l,Ive just finished watching S and . Ive heard a lot about it over the last year or two much of it using superlatives and most of it unrelated to Serial. I enjoyed both series but S was much better. S is really just a repeat in many ways of the same story in a different situation and a few of the characters seemed a bit stereotyped or unrealistic specifically Sabotkas wacko son. I agree Stringer is great. The actor guy who plays Avon is terrible in the Series at least and he never rises above cliche. The scenes about the cops are fascinating and seem convincing to me in what they show about how the department was run and office politics. Also it opens a window onto an urban existence many including me would not know much about. Those little snippets are also great like Wallace living in a squat whilst looking after a bunch of kids and getting them ready for school in the morning.Amusing to see where Susan got her tapping theory from and how that scene has been misrepresented on the DS.

8024570,0,t3_4p2rgh,I proposed that Becky lied several months ago. Back then this was an out on a limb idea. Everybody took her statement at face value even guilters. I think everyone gave high deference to both Aisha and Becky because they were genuine friends with Hae and neither has done anything disrespectful or fameseeking during or after the podcast. Im glad that this is becoming more accepted now that Beckys statement isnt true. Really the statement has zero corroboration and it was made months after the fact. Even Adnan himself contradicted this statement when talking to Adcock. And thank you for bringing up that something else to do was never brought up in court. That is more evidence that it wasnt true and everybody knew it. As for why Becky lied your theory of Kristas atonement is plausible. I would take that speculation a step further and I wonder if Adnan and Krista worked up the idea together. It appears that Adnan and Juuan were working on something why not Adnan and Krista?

Edit also worth noting that Krista is the one repeating the Becky said story today. I dont think this makes Becky a bad person. Hae was her friend but so was Adnan.

8348921,0,t1_d5l54n7,The money issue is truly hard to decipher. This is the first time we are hearing that the masjid was so behind on the balance due that any funds paid went towards back due amounts. Rabia seems completely clueless about this. Shes suggesting that the masjid should be able to pick and choose what they pay for and earmark certain parts of the payment for a field trip. Who thinks this is the way bills get paid? I cant imagine telling a lender that youd like to pay for July and August but youll pay for May and June later. Who would agree to this? The amount you pay goes toward paying down your debt. And as the person paying for services you are not entitled to renegotiate terms on a whim because you decide thats what you want. Im still unclear about much of it. It sounds like the firm recommended a jury consultant and the masjid said no. Thats one issue. It also sounds like the masjid agreed that the jury should go on a field trip but were so behind in their payments that the funds they wanted earmarked for the field trip went to paying down their balance owed to the firm. In terms of the first part it sounds like Rabia is owning the decision not to hire a jury expert and saying this is something a good attorney should do without hiring a consultant. I am no attorney but I have to agree with Gutierrez on this. It seems like both Oprah and OJ won their high profile cases mostly during jury selection. Seems like things could have gone differently for Adnan if theyd hired the consultant. The field trip doesnt seem as make or break. I do think that Jays story was still kind of grey at the time.

8622105,0,t1_d6java2,As PRNmeds notes below  I think Jay is most concerned about the fallout in his personal life if he told the truth.  It seems pretty clear that the version of the story he told his wife not to mention friends at the time of the murder differs drastically from what actually happened.  So I think unless there are charges to compel his testimony we will get more of the same.As another way to approach this  I dont think anyone ever gave Jenn a written deal and she admitted to throwing out the shovels accessory after the fact.  Perhaps the state can threaten Jenn to get Jay AND Jenn to be more truthful about what actually happened.  As much as I dont want Jay to walk free on this  I can still justify a deal for him to get the true killer off the street.For Jenn  I think she was a true victim of this crime and the trial etc on her mental well being.  Remember  she was a Magnet Program kid as well  was attending college  had a jobs etc  and her life has now clearly fallen apart.  I think at least part of that sad progression is being caught up in this murder.  Further I think Jay still has some feelings towards her his family is still involved with her and I think he would tell the truth if it meant that Jenn could escape jail time for murder.

Would it have been reasonable for a detective to think they knew that it was impossible to hire a horse in Baltimore and hence not look into it. I would consider not following it up a fairly egregious miss in that case. But Im still not sure where this common knowledge was acquired from. I can see certain books refer to local calls not being recorded by payphones but find it hard to believe that the detectives knew that distinction but perhaps experience taught them that. Perhaps advantages of having rookie detectives is that this knowledge not being inherent it might have got documented. Wouldnt law enforcement have found payphone information useful to prosecute other drug cases? Wouldnt there be records of them pushing for this information only to be rebuffed by telecom companies?,serialpodcastorigins,d6zkfj3,0,t5_39h2j

Everyone has learned to trust certain sources more than others. Guilters rally behind Jay Jenn the police amp prosecution and tend to discredit things that come from the defense side. Vice versa for the innocentundecided crowd. People who buy into the uninvolved Jay scenario reject the narrative propounded by the police amp prosecution accept arguments from the Undisclosed team and credit the promise of evidence to support this particular claim which I agree is extraordinary. I dont see the wholesale abandonment of reason. What I see is trust. I agree that the present state of the evidence makes it difficult to argue the uninvolved Jay defense. I also agree that any such theory would have to face a mountain of Jenn and that nobody puts a dude away for motorcycle money.

For that reason they would have wanted AS to mention JW of his own accord without any prompting bc that admission would have corroborated the fact that AS and JW were together.

9559944,0,t1_d9q81ji,First regarding the relative behavior of barristers and American defense attorneys please see this paper from a legal journal citing Supreme Court Justices on this very topic  Quote After comparison with the volatile atmosphere and often unruly conduct of a trial in a United States courtroom it is natural to assume that the British model of courtroom advocacy provides an instructive model for its American counterpart. After observing the British trial bar the barristers the Chief Justice concluded that British courtroom attorney performance is superior to the American bars performance.  Granted it is from the s  years ago and truthfully I had not thought about the topic since the early s  years ago and perhaps things have changed over that time period but surely I could find a barrister who was alive in the s who would support my claim  and the fact that they have just recently been allowed to use media doesnt hurt it. Given that JB himself has called this defense the first crowdsourced defense I am assuming he is acting in a way not practiced in Britain.Ironically a footnote mentions that some defense attorneys are walking sixth amendment violations which I believe is the case being made by ASLT on CG.As for your examples the articles may be notable as exceptions and one is from an actor. More important to the issue is that you must realize that theatrics can be differently interpreted  Shakespeare and real housewives are both technically theater. On the other points Im afraid my lack of clarity has led to confusion. Allow me an attempt at clarification.I agree that the concept of reasonable doubt is misplaced here. That is in fact my entire point. I have seen the term misused several times by the participants of Undisclosed and ad nauseam by commenters on Reddit and considering that the ASLT funds both Undisclosed and JB I have grouped them together in my arguments. I think I am justified in that grouping since JB himself has said that this was a crowdsourced defense.They have raised several of what they call weaknesses in the states case which they then presume to clear some bar of reasonable doubt. This is a violent abuse of the term because reasonable doubt is not a static concept  it only exists for a certain jury at a certain time. Sure they can offer their opinion that if these new weaknesses were presented at the original trial AND the state changed nothing about their case then they might convince a jury to have reasonable doubt but its not something even you or I can say we have because we are not in a courtroom hearing two sides of a case. They have no idea what the state might present and in fact if they were truthseeking they might recognize different interpretations of their weaknesses.My comment on the bail filing was not intended to say that the filing inappropriately included information attacking the weakness of the states case but rather to show that the information they presented in that vein was more appropriate for trying to establish reasonable doubt which as I note above they would like to pretend has been established in a mythical trial from  years ago.Why? Because they are attacking the character of a witness who as part of the first trial  years ago admitted to being an accessory to murder. This is not new information. How many people do you think get out on bail because they were fingered by an accomplice with no other evidence to the contrary? All of the other attacks on Jays character may serve them well in a trial to raise reasonable doubt but its not going to help in a bail hearing  unless they can show that he was lying.But they have provided neither exculpatory evidence nor evidence that shows Jay is lying about Syeds involvement.  I know youd like to believe that since Welch tossed the first conviction based on CG not challenging the cell records then that must mean Jays claims are proven unreliable because he is not corroborated by the cell records. However Welch himself made no such claim. Whether or not the first trial was voided they have added nothing to the strength or weakness of the evidence against the accused  again Welch did not rule that the cell phone evidence was weak  only that CG should have challenged it. Like Asias testimony it could very well be that the first prong of bad defense was met but the second prong wouldnt be met because the data is correct. Welch wasnt convinced that the data was correct but he didnt rule that it wasnt.Why do I think the data is correct? As opposed to a theatric argument about a subway call please read this I have an opinion on which is truth seeking and which is zealous advocacy.You have avoided the question  the disclaimer could be correct and the locations as well as far as is necessary to make the states case rendering the lack of challenge moot no? Second prong and all?And as for the lividity they have an expert and so what. The state has an expert too. Do you think a bail judge is going to sort out which ME had the right interpretation?If he is granted bail then I will buy you a drink.Regarding the use of the term charlatan if you are going to hold me to the dictionary definition why not hold me to the origin of the word? Am I charging him with being a th century medicine quack? On anonymous internet comment sites I take the liberty of using terms colloquially. What are you his mother?And yes I have spent countless hours listening to ASLT talk about their search for truth  first attempting to make this a social justicepersecution of a different race case when really they are searching to free their client. To me that is saying one thing and doing another. Colloquially char deception. I was an avid listener to undisclosed until I saw them making the same type of assumptions in their arguments as they criticized the state for. You lose the purity of intent claim when you commit the same sins as those you attack.I just dont get your points about our legal system and the search for truth. As I understand it the point of having the advocate system is that both advocates can vigorously work for their client and trust that the truth will come out of the process. Of course each advocate is not supposed to violate the truth but they are not investigators looking for truth  they are looking to provide the best defense of their client. If they were looking for truth only they might miss an opportunity to provide a defense for their client.The inquisition was a model where everyone was searching for truth  however it lacked the benefits of dual advocacy.  By the way I am referring to the State as the prosecution not the system which you have noted produced an unconstitutional trial. They have attacked the prosecution  who was not a party to CGs alleged mistake.,serialpodcastorigins,d9rgjr8,1,t5_39h2j

The  postconviction statute doesnt set out any expiration dates or filing deadlines it doesnt spell out procedure at all so it would be more than a little arbitrary for the court to rule that Adnan essentially waived his right to bail by not filing prior to a non existent deadline. If the court did rule this way Adnan would be able to appeal it. So I think the court will rule on the bail. The question is when. It would make a lot of sense for it to wait and see what the COSA does first. The ALA is a big deal. If its denied this particular bail motion will be moot and the case will go back to the trial court. If its allowed the COSA would basically be saying that it thinks the states appeal has merit without necessarily tipping its hand. If Im correct in thinking that the court is inclined to deny bail pending appeal it might as well wait for this endorsement. Btw bail decisions are basically unappealable. Judges generally prefer these kinds of decisions. Hope this helps.,serialpodcastorigins,daagavw,3,t5_39h2j

That same record indicates that Mr. Rahman was born in . I tend to think that Mr. Rahmans age is correct at the DMV. But Shamims is made up. If Mr. Rahman was born in  and was  when he married an  year old Shamim Shamim was born in . If Shamim was born in  and Tanveer is  that means Tanveer was born when Shamim was . I do think its possible that Mr. Rahman went to Pakistan and married Shamim when she was  and Shamim became pregnant. But that Mr. Rahman didnt bring Shamim to the USA until she was  not considered a minor by the US government. ,serialpodcastorigins,ddh66p2,2,t5_39h2j
10683968,0,t1_ddepgmd,I am with you. But you have to account for the context of the questioning and quality of the questioner. Jay is speaking to investigators who are tasked and trained specifically to elicit facts from fiction. They are building a case and trying to turn Jays statements into evidence. On the other hand Koenig was on a different mission in different circumstances with different rules and standing with the subject of her questions.

11148310,0,t3_5z43kb,Adnans utter lack of curiosity about who killed Hae even going to far as to avoid the question entirely has always been one of his most obvious tells. He has no interest in solving this mystery he actually persuades SK not to try and find him innocent despite the fact that the key witness who testified against him is still alive and available and there is possible DNA that has not been tested.ETA Even when Adnan addresses the court at his sentencing he cannot bring himself to call Jay a liar. As always he resorts to mushy vague phrasing.......I dont know why people have said the things they have said about me.... In sixteen years and twelve episodes of Serial he never pursues an answer to this question.,serialpodcastorigins,devndhe,17,t5_39h2j
11242956,0,t1_df6cda2,gt Theyre asking you not to wave it away as something youd find in a cheesy detective novel.Well I definitely dont do that either. So Im not sure what youre looking for. gtTheyre asking you to consider it along with all the other evidence.From my perspective Adnan is guilty with or without that note. Jays corroborated testimony makes him guilty and the Im going to kill note doesnt really corroborate a whole lot maybe helps support Jays claims that Adnan had been thinking about this for a while to some degree. Put another way if that note didnt exist Adnan would still be guilty in my view because Jays testimony is corroborated by much stronger evidence than the note e.g. Jays firsthand knowledge of burial site Jenns testimony Nisha call cell records. ,serialpodcastorigins,df6df3l,3,t5_39h2j

11307768,0,t1_dfc7ifx,I disagree with this. How could anyone be that naive? I do think that Richard was legitimately concerned about people he supported and helped. But I also know for a fact those actions were part of the enterprise. He made his fortune by being concerned for overweight people and engaging them on a personal level. Im not saying hes deeply cynical and in secret didnt care about people. But I think that once the monetary payoff was out of he equasion it was too big of an ask to maintain all this caring about others. I think the podcasters are well aware of this and one of the points they are making is that the caring Richard was congruent with the moneymaking Richard.It wasnt with good intention. My guess is that Simmons has received some kind of medical diagnosis having to do with dementia or alzheimers and prefers not to have that play out publicly. The podcast itself is the height of disrespect. But Richard knows that he made money by portraying other peoples challenges. Im sure he recognizes the irony of someone making money from his own challenges. ,serialpodcastorigins,dfdpvj4,0,t5_39h2j
