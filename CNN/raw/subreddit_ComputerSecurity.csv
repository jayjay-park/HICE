It is entirely possible to learn everything you need to know using man and apropros.Compared with some of the Linux man pages it is light years ahead of the competition.,ComputerSecurity,cpgiu7l,2,t5_2qhy7

7483945,0,t1_d2ssd1a,Honestly I think it was because I use the same password for TeamViewer that I used for other online accounts that were blatantly hacked. I changed the password on everything but TeamViewer.I know I know... I swear Im not usually that much of an idiot.But it was the most recent version of TeamViewer and as far as I know I dont have malware  I ran Malwarebytes before work and when that was done I started a Norton full system scan before I left for work and if you have any other suggestions for free antimalware software to scan it with I genuinely would love to hear it so I can feel safer. I definitely do not download cracked games edit or any cracked software at all or drop my firewall in fact I should probably stop spending so much money on Steam sales.They had access to my account. There was another computer on my TeamViewer account that was hacked immediately after mine was. All computers are now rid of TeamViewer except for the computer I wrote about here which Im leaving TeamViewer installed on only for the Ubuntu scan at which point Ill immediately uninstall it. TeamViewer is turned completely off though.As far as I can tell before using the Unix scan you linked they just came on and went to Amazon and PayPal in hopes of me being logged in.CC ubillybobcoder,ComputerSecurity,d2svswx,2,t5_2qhy7

10113414,1,t3_5kntos,Moderators spend a lot of time reading all the posts on their forums and after a little while they get to know the writing styles of their regulars. Misspellings are a common error that serve as a flag if youve created similar posts with the same misspelling under two different account names and one of them is newly created thats sort of a red flag to them.,ComputerSecurity,dbpsc0j,0,t5_2qhy7
