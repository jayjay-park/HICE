4619608,0,t3_3e9a4c,To answer that question on the forum I think it is pretty bad going north too.. Its not really away from Boston.. Just around it... Woburn might not be bad  min train to Lowell or Boston you might prefer the commuter rail anyway.. Theres a Downtown shuttle from the station to Tsongas every  minutes all day.,LowellMA,ctcvn1w,2,t5_31a22

LTE is good the rest of the way but I imagine Verizon is better.,LowellMA,dc0ppcm,2,t5_31a22
