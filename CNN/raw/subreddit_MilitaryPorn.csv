It is a recoilless smoothbore.The difference is essentially where the propellant is located.In a rocket like the M LAW the propellant is located within the grenade. With a recoilless weapon the propellant is located behind it.It should be noted that some recoilless weapons like the RPG and Carl Gustav can fire ammunition that has a rocket booster that engages in flight to extend the range of the grenade.,MilitaryPorn,cenp5a4,3,t5_2sq9y

88051,0,t1_ceofds7,APCs exist already...if youre in an urban patrol against a presumably asymmetric threat like what these scout vehicles would be used for then I would imagine that IEDs would be a very real danger. But if you were in a situation where troops and fire support were needed in a heavy frontline engagement then you still have APCs. And I seriously doubt that the US Army has seen its last IED. Asymmetrical warfare is here to stay. Even a conventional opponent would be quick to exploit a demonstrated vulnerability...the point of armor is for it not to have holes in it. Just curious how do these represent a compromise? The way I see it it would be an unpalatable compromise to field a non IEDprotected vehicle. And I dont really think you can trot out the JSF argument for this thing...the BRVs been designed to replace one vehicle not multiple vehicles. It may be somewhat ridiculous to replace the f f and f with one VSTOL plane but replacing one armored truck with another better armored truck is a little bit different.,MilitaryPorn,ceogc68,2,t5_2sq9y

The SMGs were initially fitted with the standard M rifles duckbill or threeprong flash hiders which did not alleviate the problem. In September  Colt developed a .inch long moderator that lessened the noise and muzzle flash which also increased the weapons reliability by increasing the amount of back pressure. However the moderator created its own problems such as heavy bore fouling and causing tracer bullets to wildly yaw. A .inch long moderator with six slots and an expansion chamber which further reduced noise and flash replaced the previous muzzle device and became standard for the SMG and the Commando series but fouling and tracer problems persisted.,MilitaryPorn,cgjrf2o,12,t5_2sq9y

1135201,0,t1_chwr1ae,Im not sure it could have given them air superiority even if they had produced them in any meaningful quantity. For starters they were losing great quantities of skilled air crew and pilots due to sheer attrition and unsustainable losses on both fronts  with no pilot rotation system both to preserve pilots and to use combat experience in role as instructors as the US and British did on a regular basis. Without a ready supply of experienced and well trained pilots to fly the complicated and finicky ME numbers of planes produced would have been offset by the sheer lack of skill competence from its users which would have resulted in an even higher amount of accidents and engine blowouts which the ME was notorious for.Secondly even with the limited amounts of MEs the Germans did have they had barely any fuel to power them. Most of their fuel stocks came from a synthetic coal solution named J  and the synthetic coal producing plants were already coming under heavy attention from allied strategic bombing campaigns. Fuel shortages were crippling not only to ME formations like Jagdgeschwader  Nowotnoy  but all sectors of the Luftwaffe. Pilots as per training videos Ive seen only had two or three flights at most for training in which to familiarize themselves with the revolutionary jet engines and negotiating the treacherous landing gear  which while improved with the tricycle configuration was still delicate and often broke under hard landing  causing catastrophic accidents. Pilots had precious few hours of flight time due to fuel shortages and a need to rotate planes for training purposes which while it could be mitigated with higher production numbers  the fuel situation would remain unchanged. All the pilots selected for ME units were already aces and were brilliant pilots the training was not to teach them to fly but just to get them familiar with the new engines and landing and take off procedures  which were complicated in their own right.Finally  the remaining allies had already made progress on their own fighter jet planes such as the P and Meteor. While admittedly inferior to the ME in speed maneuverability armament and even plain visibility  they had similar characteristics and could have posed a serious challenge to ME formations had they encountered one another. If the Luftwaffe did have a reasonable amount of ME aircraft and had the fuel to deploy them  along with a healthy amount of pilot and trained ground crew. They could have expected a hearty advantage  that would have proved temporary in the face of greater allied jet deployment and counter tactics.The MEs engines also were not made with strong enough alloys that could withstand the extreme heats produced by the engines. This was caused both by a shortage of strategic resources in the German economy and a lack of innovation that would later come along in extremely strong aluminum titanium steel and other alloys in later advanced jet aircraft. As a result the engines had limited life times that could only be expected to get around  hours at best from the engines. They would frequently burn holes in themselves due to their lower heat tolerances.  The ME was fast but it was not so fast as to be impossible to intercept. If the  dropped speed or got into any amount of turning or energy fighting with allied aircraft such as the P Mustang it could be destroyed in a Dogfight  as was proved by the venerable Tuskegee airmen over Berlin. Allied prop aircraft could lure Mes to attack bombers and lower fighter planes while prop planes placed at higher altitude dive down to intercept the otherwise preoccupied Jet fighters. The  also had poor low speed performance and acceleration  as did all early jet aircraft. If you caught it at low speed either at take off or landing they were exceptionally vulnerable  causing the Luftwaffe to set up extensive flak shields around bases with s to protect them from such tactics. If a prop plane  which has much better throttle response and acceleration  caught an ME at low speed in combat as well they could have superior performance characteristics in a certain range of speeds and altitudes. Although the  did have excellent turning and handling characteristics  it was not defenseless in such situations. As well the principal armament of the  was  formidable mm Mk Rheinmettalborsig cannons firing at a phenomenal  rounds per minute. This was a powerful force against enemy bomber formations but there were drawbacks to these cannons. They were lower velocity scarifying speed for a shorter barrel and higher rate of fire. A pilot needed to be within around  or so meters before engaging otherwise the cannons were not accurate or at a high enough velocity to inflict serious damage. The  was not equipped with airbrakes making diving on B bomber formations hazardous and less effective due to the distance one could engage being shortened by the short barreled cannons. This was compounded by the aircrafts extreme speeds  giving the pilot only about  or  seconds with which to fire his guns at his targets. This reduced effectiveness both as an interceptor and a fighter  due to its sparse ammunition load compared to other allied fighters carrying higher velocity and high capacity mm and . caliber machine guns.in short  even if they had more technical isues lack of pilots lack of trained ground crew and most of all a lack of fuel would have made it almost irrelevant.EDIT I just realized I typed a huge essay unconsciously  Im not trying to deride you or insult you with this response it simply got out of hand ,MilitaryPorn,chxbjbs,2,t5_2sq9y

At that point it loses its lustre as a support weapon and will probably be just as effective as artillery or a hellfire which costs about half of what a Javelin does plus you dont have to carry itWhat youve said still doesnt really address the question of costbenefit analysis given that the Javelin costs nearly  times what an AT costs.

Personally Im in favour of more integration because overall it would be far more efficient and allow a better allocation of funds as it stands now theres a lot of duplication of roles across militaries in the EU and theres a lot of variation in equipment making cross cooperation difficult.I think the reverse of what Battle Groups are should occur The EU gets all the core military the member nations get Rapid Reaction Forces that act independently of the Federation to act in the State interests. Thats a pipe dream and probably wont happen until the Federal government gets more powerWhich is going to happen in the next few decades or a dissolution of the Union. Whats more realistic to me and should happen in the short term is a streamlining of the deployment process so that Battlegroups actually get deployed on missions for some field experience as opposed to just sitting around all day doing jack.,MilitaryPorn,cjkiggl,3,t5_2sq9y

McEachin Combat Damage Assessment Team AGAU Low Angle Firings Versus Individual Soviet Tanks FebruaryMarch  Volume  United States Air Force February In this test an A aircraft attacked two combatloaded individual Soviet T tanks in five missions totaling seven passes technicians rehabilitated the two vehicles after each pass. The aircraft were seldom higher than  feet in altitude firings were initiated between  and  feet and terminated at ranges of  to  feet at dive angles of . to .. The bursts ranged from  to  rounds.Altogether  DU rounds struck the tanks during the seven passes including no impacts on one pass. The ratio of impacts to rounds fired was .. Of the  impacts  penetrated the armored envelopes for a ratio of perforations to impacts of .. The report noted many of the side or rear impacts that did not penetrate the armor nonetheless extensively damaged the tanks exterior suspension components whereas all the rounds that hit the tanks front caused minimal damage. These results reinforced the strategy of attacking tanks from the side or rear to optimize damage potential.That and if you read the report it will show you that fighting a t copy might just might be pierced but a fully up to date modern MBT has absolutely nothing to fear from a A mm GAU. Shit of the five tanks  were utterly unharmed.This is why most of its kills were from mavericks and such. Furthermore read friendly fire reports and youll see that the A accounts for like  plus.

4254263,0,t1_cs4y2zd,What do you two mean by drones? Predators and UCLASS? its very easy to design short range high speed remote controlled suicide drones to swarm targets and Russia is quite a bit ahead in the design of such systems that are also designed to target up to a range of  km away and  km up from the drone control vehicle that is equipped with radar IR and day light camera to track both up to four drones and the target. And those are only the drone systems the Russians use to protect their larger drone systems that have suicide drones that can autonomously track and engage targets some of those larger drones are equipped with both radar and IR sensor to find their targets at much greater ranges. Additionally some of those drones can find and kill airborne jammers without much outside control necessary by humans.The Russians also have a drone launching high speed jet that targets AEW tankers and jammers for its sixpack drone swarm that it carries.Those are not drones!!! you are probably thinking. And the systems launching them Pantsir S S MiG and not something as stupid as drone control vehicle!!! Why? Just because we call them missiles? What is the difference between a suicide drone and a missile? If you think of drones guided bombs and missiles as killer robots as a general term then the US bet sounds a bit different Lets put killer robots into other killer robots. UCLASSguided bombs for example Compared to the Russian bet Lets increase the range of our killer robots. S R Kh ,MilitaryPorn,cs567a8,0,t5_2sq9y

EDs have a  Greek for delta natch on the nose cone.The ED has several dozen rows of external rivets on the fuselage aft of the three windows on the starboard side going all the way back to the ass end of the aircraft.The ED has a large brass ball tucked up underneath the bottom of the fuselage aft. Its a little under two feet in diameter.The ED lacks the distinctive fez SATCOM antenna on top of the rotodome. It actually has two SATCOM antennas on top of the dome but they are a much more flushfitting design.If you look very closely the ED has an extra oil cooler scoop and exhaust on the inboard side of the starboard engine.Thats about it. For those of you wondering what in the hell an ED is doing in Alaska theyre up there on detachment for training I think with the USAF. I work in the same hangar as them normally in Norfolk VA.If you have any other questions about Es ask em. Ill answer them if I legally can.Edit I forgot there is another difference  the tube that goes between the fuselage and the rotodome pylon in the middle is much more aerodynamically shaped on the Delta its just a simple tube we call it the stovepipe on the Charlie.

4314158,0,t1_csbvqht,The hardpoints are specifically designed to have a lowRCS.Theres  parts to passive radar stealth. Materials  you can use materials that absorb radar energy  these have limited use however as you typically need very thick layers to absorb  of the energy and so the thick absorbing stuff is used inside the aircraft structure while the skin has a thinner layer that helps a bit.. Shaping  this is where most of an aircrafts stealth comes from.  Because an aircraft has to have surfaces unless its a black hole  singularity it has to reflect radar energy somewhere. A sphere reflects in all directions evenly. A triangular aircraft reflects directly upwards and downwards as well as in  horizontal directions and a bit elsewhere  radio waves  microwaves radar will diffract and scatter a little bit.  On aircraft like the F and F the goal is to make the surfaces line up so that they reflect into the place that the enemy is least likely to be or see them from  to the sides. Thats because if an F  F flies past a radar the radar will only see a very short glimpse which it wont be able to discern from random noise energy from the sun civilian emissions etc. The F and F also go a little further by having their side reflections bounce towards the ground or high into the sky meaning that you only get a really significant but momentary radar return if the jet is turning away towards or away from you.Consider the shape of a hardpoint I think you mean pylon though its thin and has a sharp front edge it also has flat sides. In other words the only place youll get a significant radar return from them is from the sides where youll get a significant radar return from multiple parts of the jet. Its not perfect for stealth but it doesnt take too much away from the stealth factor. The big killer generally for stealth aircraft is to do with scattering and diffraction off the weapons and their electromagnetic interaction with the hardpoints wing and fuselage.The F isnt stealthy when carrying external weapons but it does have radar absorbing materials to help absorb some of that erratic scattering etc off the weapons and it does have little features in its hardpoints  pylons that help reduce those effects.If you want to learn more about this kind of stuff I highly recommend reading through this PDF it has plenty of graphics etc to help you understand the material as wellwww.web.archive.orgwebSome of its a tad simplified  slightly old but the basics are still the same.,MilitaryPorn,csbxkoh,7,t5_2sq9y

But also the Bin Ladentype raids we hear about on television arent all they do their original purpose is to infiltrate via water access so swim ashore work underwater work on the high seas etc and so thats still a crucial part of their training. Its just that the US isnt really newly invading a lot of countries right now but rather needs its special forces to do complicated missions as part of ongoing conflicts so thats what we get in the media.,MilitaryPorn,cv2a1hc,2,t5_2sq9y

Of course if you want the same gliding capabilities it pretty much forces you to create the same kind of design as aerodynamics work the same way in Russia but thats not the point.The point is just how far in the journey to low Earth orbit do you think copying the orbiter aerodynamics gets you? Correct absolutely nowhere. Despite looking somewhat similar Buran launches and functions completely different from the Space shuttle.,MilitaryPorn,cv6o8yb,6,t5_2sq9y

Some quick info TLd from the postYesterday the third serial production DozorB was released.  more are to be released and delivered to MoD by the end of the year. Next year factory will be ready for full mass production per monthbut that depends on Ukraines  military budgetPretty decently equippedwith a Deutz fahr Diesel engine and Allison automatic transmissionnavigation and air conditioningwhile still costing half the price of a KrazStreit group Spartan which is not as well equipped. The production quality at Lviv BTRz is also much higher. TL note Kraz spartan is losing popularity as its too heavy for its chassishas poor offroad performance and is expensive.Plant has the usual deficit of specialists. Only several dozen hired in  months. Hundreds of vacancies CNC operatorsfitterstunersetc...The factory has had  directors for the past year and a halffirst two were classic soviet while the third guy is more progressivewhich is a good sign Finallyof all armor factoriesLviv BTRz is the most alive as seen by Yuri Biriukov over year.

That the moderate Syrians wont be able to keep the country together against IS.  Considering Iraq thats not entirely unjustified.  Sure if Assad had gone down in  things might be different but its too late now.  Ive done a lot of research on the subject but this is basically my opinion so youre free to disagree.

5637873,0,t1_cwvv31i,gtContrary to some rumours the museums are no longer required to maintain them at a reserve state of readiness just in case.Quoting you from the link you posted. So this following no longer holds truegtAlthough the navy firmly believes in the capabilities of the DDX destroyer program members of the United States Congress remain skeptical about the efficiency of the new destroyers when compared to the battleships. Partially as a consequence Congress passed Pub. L.  the National Defense Authorization Act  requiring the battleships be kept and maintained in a state of readiness should they ever be needed again. Congress has ordered that the following measures be implemented to ensure that if need be Iowa and Wisconsin can be returned to active dutygt Iowa and Wisconsin must not be altered in any way that would impair their military utility The battleships must be preserved in their present condition through the continued use of cathodic protection dehumidification systems and any other preservation methods as needed Spare parts and unique equipment such as the inch  mm gun barrels and projectiles be preserved in adequate numbers to support Iowa and Wisconsin if reactivated The navy must prepare plans for the rapid reactivation of Iowa and Wisconsin should they be returned to the navy in the event of a national emergency.These four conditions closely mirror the original three conditions that the Nation Defense Authorization Act of  laid out for the maintenance of Iowa and Wisconsin while they were in the Mothball Fleet.From ,MilitaryPorn,cwvxk9o,4,t5_2sq9y

Same when Morocco purchased some Fs they were delivered by American pilots.In the case of the UAE though I believe the planes were flown back to the UAE by Emirati pilots.

6099283,0,t1_cyim7xr,Its not quite as straightforward as that.  The Soviet Union had . million men and the Allies had  million about  million Americans and  million British Imperials in the ETO.  The Allies had better logistics and better planes.  The Soviets did build great tanks and planes but they built the planes in limited quantities and they were heavily reliant on the Allies for raw materials.  Its often forgotten how much stuff the Soviets got from the West.  That stuff includes things like food telephone wire railroad rails etc.  In peacetime that stuff could be manufactured or replaced by a large civilian workforce.  In this case there would be no replacing those things when they broke.  The raw materials werent even available steel aluminum nickel and zinc were not being produced in any significant quantities due to the devastation and depopulation caused by the War.Ill grant that they have something of a qualitative advantage in tanks but not in every other kind of vehicle.  Combined the Western Allies have over four times as many planes fighters and bombers.  Their artillery may be equally good but I would give the advantage to the Americans artillery is something the US was really really good at in WW.  The British Army is in decline but its a veteran force.  The American Army is waxing in strength but theres a big disparity in unit quality.  The Soviet units on the knifes edge are very good but the rest of the army is poor to middling.  Dont forget that by this time the Soviet Army is also in decline.  Since  the Soviets have been drafting men from their liberated areas straight into the army usually with no training whatsoever.  The discipline issues and the total lack of tactical finesse was extraordinarily apparent in units composed of those soldiers.So with that in mind lets wargame this for a second.  Im going to ignore that by December  the US was producing a nuke a month because we really dont know how we would have used the Bomb against the Soviet Union.The Soviet Armies attack.  They need to project their armies into a western Germany that had been devastated by aerial attack in ways that the eastern half of Germany never had to face.  Their depots are further back than the Allies depots.  Initially theyll have the alliedsupplied trucks to do the job but those will begin to break down or get destroyed. Allied airpower will make itself felt fairly rapidly and kick the logistic props out from under the Soviet Army.  The actual combat experience will vary according to what unit is facing what but in general the Allies will be pushed back.  In some places they may even collapse but the Soviet Army wont be able to exploit the advantage.  Allies bombers really cant reach the untouched Soviet industrial areas so theyll focus on interdiction.  Eventually the Soviet advance would peter out.  An Allied counteroffensive would probably follow.  Given the Allies military record it would likely be an unimaginative attack focused on the Wests superiority of material.  It would be bloody and it would be ugly but the Soviets would ultimately begin to give way.Would the Soviet Army collapse?  Maybe.  Would the Western Allies have been able to invade the Soviet Union?  Probably not.  Would the Allies have been able to free Poland?  Its entirely possible.  One thing is certain it would have been bloody as hell.  The biggest loser would have been millions more dead in central and eastern Europe.,MilitaryPorn,cyixcxn,9,t5_2sq9y

6367272,0,t3_42rq20,From a friend Something about the picture is weird. Guy on the left is definitely wearing Russian kit. But I can see that his load bearing equipment is being worn rather loosely over body armor. B or B with a kevlar shoulder pauldron on the right shoulder another strange move considering he is clearly right handed. Either way the body armor has MOLLE attachment points on it already so why wear a vest over it? Take the pouches off the simple webbing and attach it to your plate carrier. Its not practical. If anything it is only going to get in the way of movement.Also the goggles are those a tank crewman would wear. Not standard Russian issue. His weapon is not standard Russian issue also not from this decade anyway. Which also raises the question why this Russian Spetsnaz member would have an LMG variant of a standard AKM something that his country no longer issues to combat units and only use standard capacity  round magazines? No s?  All the pouches on his sloppily worn vest are for s.He does not even have a radio. Thats something more akin to the guy on the right than any Russian combat unit. No headset which is standard issue. No visible radio equipment which is standard issue. Why would they just throw in some guy without any communications equipment looking  out of place underequipped and alone. lolMy verdict B.S. There is a lot of Russian kit on that guy but he is not a member of the Russian Armed Forces. Maybe some contractor or a Syrian playing dressup. Because Ive seen Syrians in Russian body armor and helmets before.Have a nice day.Read more at ,MilitaryPorn,czde0gt,-13,t5_2sq9y

6407250,0,t3_43eloj,Im reading Dispatches by Michael Herr and he touched on the Lrrps. He said  I knew one th Division Lurp who took his pills by the fistful downs from the left pocket of his tiger. suit and ups from the right one to cut the trail for him and the other to send him down it. He told me that they cooled things out just right for him that he could see that old jungle at night like he was looking at it through a starlight scope. They sure give you the range he said. This was his third tour. In  hed been the only survivor  in a platoon of the Cay wiped out going into the Ia Drang Valley. In  hed. come back with the Special Forces. and one morning after an ambush hed hidden under the bodies of his team while the VC walked all around them with knives making sure. They stripped the bodies of their gear the berets too and finally went away laughing. After that there was nothing left for him in the war except the Lurps. I just cant hack it back in the World he said. He told me that after hed come back home the last time he would sit in his room all day and sometimes hed stick a hunting rifle out the window leading people and cars as they passed his house until the only feeling he was aware of was all up in the tip of that one finger. It used to put my folks real uptight he said. But he put people uptight here too even here. No man Im sorry hes just too crazy for me one of the men in his team said. Alls you got to do is look in his eyes thats the whole fucking story right there.. Yeah but you better do it quick someone else said. I mean you dont want to let him catch you at it. But he always seemed to be watching for it I think he slept with his eyes open and I was afraid of him anyway All I ever managed was one quick look in and that was like looking at the floor of an ocean. He wore a gold earring and a headband torn from a piece of camouflage parachute material and since nobody was about to tell him to get his hair cut it fell below his shoulders covering a thick purple scar. Even at. division he never went anywhere without at least a . and a knife and he thought I was a freak because Iwouldnt carry a weapon. Didnt you ever meet a reporter before? I asked him. Tits on a bull he said. Nothing personal. But what a story he told me as onepointed and resonant as any war story lever heard it took me a year to understand it Patrol went up the mountain. One man came back. Hedied before he could tell us what happened. I waited for the rest but it seemed not to be that kind of story when I asked him what had happened he just looked like he felt sorry for me fucked if hed waste time telling stories to anyone dumb as I was. His face was all painted up for night walking now like abad hallucination not like the painted faces Id seen in San Francisco only a few weeks before the other extreme of the same theater. In the coming hours hed stand as faceless and. quiet in the jungle as a fallen tree and God help his opposite numbers unless they had at least half a squad along he was agood killer one of our best. The rest of his team were gathered outside the tent set a little apart from the other division units with its own Lurpdesignated latrine and its own exclusive freezedry rations threestar. war food the same chop they sold at Abercrombie amp Fitch. The regular division troops would almost shy off the path when they passed the area on their way to and from the mess tent. No matter how toughened up they became in the war they still looked innocent compared to the Lurps. When the team had grouped they walked in a file down the hill to the lz across the strip tothe perimeter and into the treeline. I never spoke to him again but I saw him. When they came back in the next morning he had a prisoner with him blindfolded and with his elbows bound sharply behind him. The Lurp area would definitely be off limits during the interrogation and anyway I was already down at the strip waiting for a helicopter to come and take me out of there.Sorry for the wall of text I just love his description and story around them.,MilitaryPorn,czhxtqp,18,t5_2sq9y

6590566,0,t1_d00x0mt,There is a great story with a SR and a Cessnagt There were a lot of things we couldnt do in an SR but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if because of this fact it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there at least for a moment.gt It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed  hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts  feet below us I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was finally after many humbling months of simulators and study ahead of the jet.gt I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was with no really good view of the incredible sights before us tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult too for me to relinquish control of the radios as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground however. Walt was so good at many things but he couldnt match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.gt Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center far below us controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope albeit briefly we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.gt We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied November Charlie  Im showing you at ninety knots on the ground.gt Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna or to Air Force One they always spoke in the exact same calm deep professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the  Houston Center voice. I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this countrys space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didnt matter what sector of the country we would be flying in it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely over the years pilots always wanted to ensure that when transmitting they sounded like Chuck Yeager or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.gt Just moments after the Cessnas inquiry a Twin Beech piped up on frequency in a rather superior tone asking for his ground speed. I have you at one hundred and twentyfive knots of ground speed. Boy I thought the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue a navy F pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. Center Dusty  ground speed check. Before Center could reply Im thinking to myself hey Dusty  has a ground speed indicator in that milliondollar cockpit so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it ol Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. Hes the fastest dude in the valley today and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply always with that same calm voice with more distinct alliteration than emotion Dusty  Center we have you at  on the ground.gt And I thought to myself is this a ripe situation or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still I thought it must be done  in mere seconds well be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.gt Somewhere  miles above Arizona there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally and with no emotion Walter spoke Los Angeles Center Aspen  can you give us a ground speed check? There was no hesitation and the replay came as if was an everyday request. Aspen  I show you at one thousand eight hundred and fortytwo knots across the ground.gt I think it was the fortytwo knots that I liked the best so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say in his most fighterpilotlike voice Ah Center much thanks were showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.gt For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A.came back with Roger that Aspen Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.gt It all had lasted for just moments but in that short memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed and more importantly Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine days work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.gt For just one day it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.,MilitaryPorn,d010o9j,46,t5_2sq9y

6640187,0,t1_d063kk9,You dont know what youre taking about. The F is completely different technology to the F. Its much older and much less capable. Secondly any stealth aircraft including the F will show up on a radar of it gets close enough. Those Fs were flying the same routes at the same times night after night so the enemy was basically able to move the radar stations to be in the path of the Fs. Thats why the F got shot down. Anyway this guy is talking out his ass to say with such confidence that the raptors have drop tanks to mask its true radar signature. Stealth jets have components they use in a non combat environment that reflect radar waves so everyone can see them for safety and deconfliction. The raptors would have been using that as they came into Korea. Theres no need for fuel tanks to mask its true RCS. Zneave made that up and I called him out for it. Anyone who has a problem with what I said is pretty much implying that the raptor isnt stealthy. Because apparently you think it would show up on North Korean radars if it was flying in South Korea in a stealth configuration. If you think the raptors stealth is compromised from that far out explain to me a scenario where you think its stealth is useful. ,MilitaryPorn,d065ih8,-1,t5_2sq9y

After that things started becoming more automated but in many things tolerances went down on daytoday items.  While we certainly can do amazing things today the average items we deal with every day are not nearly as finely made.  Many of the seminal machining texts were made in the first half of the th Century.  Think about boring  gun barrels.  Its mindnumbing to consider the tolerances they were made to.

I cant begin to fathom why the coalition just doesnt do the same. sYes Putin did act swift strong and decisively in Syria but I would hardly call offering airstrike support a good indication of overall military strength. If anything the fact that Russia is already talking about pulling out lets not forget the sorry state of the ruble is showing that they would not be able to offer sustained support. Lastly I think its an illusion to think Putin cares half as much about the presence of ISIS as he is concerned about oneupping the West and keeping his buddy Assad in power. You could argue that Assad is the lesser of two evils here but its to the people of Syria to decide if he should stay in power not us as a foreign power. The longterm effects of such careless intervention could be far more devastating as we have seen time and time again. ,MilitaryPorn,d2nnl1j,12,t5_2sq9y

8033683,0,t1_d4iri7k,Not exactly. The rocket motor of a missile is normally burnt out by the endgame  the missile is just a very fast glider at the final stages of intercept. While attempting to deliver its warhead onto target the missile may have to execute various highg maneuvers up to  times the number of Gs the target is pulling to deliver its payload to where it expects the target to be called proportional navigation. High Gs bleed airspeed extremely rapidly  the higher the G the more speed it loses and speed lost is never regained since the rocket motor has burnt out. In contrast the F can more or less maintain its speed throughout its evasive maneuvers. Its comparison with the SR and MiGR is not exactly applestoapples because although the Raptor is slower and doesnt fly as high its way more stealthy and way more agile than either the Foxbat had a turning radius of  miles at Mach  with an infinitely better missile detectionwarning system to boot. The advertised speeds you see on Wikipedia for missiles is right at the instant of motor burn out. ,MilitaryPorn,d4j28m2,1,t5_2sq9y

On top of that the Tornados doctrine for the first couple of decades of its life at least was just...bad.The RAF held that fast and low interdiction was the way to go while the FE was normally flying higher but at comparable speeds. The Tornado had several losses due to overly complex strikes resulting in blasts from fellow Tornado jets taking out ones overflying airfields and targets.The methodology was nice in theory but overly complex very hard to execute and more vulnerable to AA than was believed by our RAF command.The Tornado was okay it has served us fairly well and has been a relatively decent aircraft but the FE is exceptional and for that reason the FE will continue to fly into the s while the Tornado is to be replaced by the F which is not really the same kind of aircraft but can probably on the whole do about as good a job and is capable of far much more in many ways.,MilitaryPorn,d69m44z,1,t5_2sq9y

9067884,0,t1_d81rthx,But it hasnt. The US military has always existed first and foremost to fight a peer adversary regional peacekeeping and counter insurgency has always been an exception the closest theyve come has been Vietnam which is a far cry more conventional than what were doing today. Look at the actual security objectives of the US military before you talk about what theyre fulfilling. If were talking about equipping for Afghanistan the military wouldnt have anything bigger than a thousand MRAPS and Prop planes and drones. We wouldnt have any warships let alone aircraft carriers. Why do we have any jet aircraft at all? The enemy has virtually no antiaircraft capacity. A simple look at the composition of the US armed forces tells us that its blatantly false to think the military is only oriented around fighting counterinsurgencylow intensity warfare. Whether or not that should be the case is another debate but attacking every weapons system not directly related to doing something thats not the established mission is at best pointless. Attack the cause not a small symptom. gtWe achieved total air dominance instantly and as for air to ground support what could the F do so much better than any current aircraft that would justify its price tag?Be cheaper? Because it would cost more than two and a half times as much to try and keep the aging cold war airframes flying than it would be to buy the F to replace them and youd have a much worse capability for that cost. You cant just squeeze infinite lifetime out of an airframe designed for  hours of flight time. Though of course we could always buy more of the planes we already have! But by the time you take a brand new F and equip it with drop tanks targeting pods and EWECM pods its as expensive as an F and less capable and inherently obsolete in the coming years as it was designed with s and s technology in mind. Youd get a worse product that would be obsolete in a few decades for the same price. gt Otherwise you might as well bring back propdriven aircraft like they literally just did with two OV BroncosWhich is a fine idea since something like the A is ten times or more as expensive as a prop plane which can do the same job and neither stand a chance in contested air space. However it does not fill the roles the aging airframes do so theres not really much of a choice with proceeding with new high performance aircraft regardless of if a cost effective COIN craft is introduced. This is why youre being called ignorant you dont know why the US military exists or what its mission is and you dont know that the thing youre railing against for being too expensive is by far the cheaper alternative. ,MilitaryPorn,d81t9w7,1,t5_2sq9y

9181531,0,t1_d8fomhi,Yes. This is why whenever you read about SAMs or AAMs in the specialized literature you will rarely see maximum range mentioned as a given  it changes dramatically depending on the circumstances.For AAMs for example maximum range assumes the missile being fired from the aircraft flying at highest practical altitude and with highest practical velocity against a target that flies on low altitude and is not evading the missile. For SAMs it is against a nonevading target flying at a lowest altitude that the missiles guidance can aim at. If you shoot from low altitude against a target flying higher your range can be reduced to less than  of  your maximum. This is also why maneuvering warheads are such a big thing when it comes to ballistic missiles and ABM and why it is such a difficult thing to achieve.  When your missile is speeding at  Ma or more against a target any change of direction is extremely costly and would require a very powerful impulse  lots of fuel  which in turn would require more fuel to accelerate everything that is necessary to redirect the missile.Even a small midcourse correction can be expensive in terms of fuel for a SAM a bit better for AAMs.,MilitaryPorn,d8ftrq1,6,t5_2sq9y

9805739,0,t1_dakb8lz,Continuing...gtEven if you look at F and YF independently built by competing bureaus they share a loooot of common elements simply because theyve applied the same principles.Yes they are. For a couple of reasons. The most primary among them is that they both had access to the same data and the same design brief. When you are cooking from the same group of ingredients it isnt hard to come up with shockingly similar designs. And when both of the design bureaus have access to the same stealth technology designs and ideas such as Have Blue and Tacit Blue they will hit many of the same marks. Again engineering similarities are rarely by chance.And to that end I would present to you the Joint Strike Fighter program. Where two teams who didnt share data like before but had their own home brewed designs presented their best. And the two JSF candidates couldnt be more further apart from each other if they tried. So clearly you can see that when design briefs arent pigeonholed like the YF program was you get true variety.And finally while we are on the subject of copying designs I will also present the Project .. A Mikoyan prototype that is every bit a scaled up Eurofighter Typhoon. So similar are the proportions that I am certain many aviation buffs wouldnt even notice it wasnt a Typhoon at a glance.The truth of the matter is espionage is a thing. It happens all the time even today and it is still a big part of military weapon development across the board. The United States spends an obscene amount of money on RampD and does a very thorough vetting of nearly all of its designs F bumble fuck not withstanding and they are regularly seen as the leader in military hardware development the world round. So just like every other leading design out there it seems to reason that the best US design elements would end up on someone elses war machines. Especially when it is something as important specialized and difficult as stealth technology.,MilitaryPorn,dalrnnc,1,t5_2sq9y

In Call of Duty you have access to everything.IRL you got shit like inventory versus what you wish you had and whats available.The grenade launcher definitely affects accuracy when youre holding it up in a standing or kneeling position. The foregrip for positive purchase helps a cup grip over a launcher tube is just not as effective.I mean I havent shot .xmm from a standing position so Im probably talking out my ass but with a grenade launcher attached it stands to reason it adds more overall weight which affects the ability to hit shit consistently at a distance due to naturally occurring arm fatigue. If Im carrying a heavy hunting rifle I prefer to shoot from a prone position with a stable rest just because of this.Annnd the m might have been all they had available hence why this fella aint carrying a german made polymer launcher.  ,MilitaryPorn,dc6blw8,4,t5_2sq9y

The Kashmir issue has literally nothing to do with ethnicity and little to do with religion anymore. Today it is about the fact that most of Pakistans water flows through Kashmir and that it serves as a great excuse for both countries to keep pumping money into their defense budgets. The ethnic disputes in Pakistan are more internal and are by and large extremely silly in the big picture perspective.I highly doubt your shoe on the other foot statement but lets just agree to disagree because thats a big ol can of false equivalency.
