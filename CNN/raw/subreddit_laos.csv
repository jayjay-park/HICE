3961259,0,t1_cr7roh2,Well not JW. But in my opinion its a bit worse. JW usually just go door to door and are sometimes a bit pushy but theyre open with their purpose. The group this person is part of goes under the guise of helping people by teaching them English or something else with barely any training. But in reality theyre only going to teach them enough English to allow them to talk to them about God and thats it.Thats the thing that gets me. This group sends  people per group in without alerting them of the dangers apart from the whole Being a martyr is the best gift you can give to God thing and they send those people in blind and inefficiently equipped to do the thing that they say theyre going there to do.My entire family and any friends who arent as delusional as them have been trying to make them reconsider because they arent suited for passive beneficial mission work. The idea of mission trips like this is to help improve the lives of others and then maybe talk about their God if it comes up but not being pushy about it.Like you said theyre supposed to help people live together. Theyre supposed to help people. But ultimately its just a Ill be better than everyone if I do this or I wont burn in hell forever if I do this. Its this delusional notion that forcing religion on someone will somehow improve their life more than teaching them lessons they can use or building shelters or feeding the hungry.,laos,cr7tf74,1,t5_2ro7e

9501284,0,t1_d9k1v8x,Yeah these locals have been making a trail that leads to the top and sell snacks and drinks at the base. It was pretty rocky and steep but only took me  minutes. They are building a platform at the top but when I was there they hadnt finished it quite yet. ,laos,d9k8i3e,1,t5_2ro7e

Pretty much all of the major cities in Laos are on the Mekong. Vang Vieng might not be that bad of an option for you if you can find a place to stay long term. The scenery is truly breathtaking. The most beautiful place Ive seen in SEA. And since most of the tubing bars have been shut down they have been getting a lot more normal tourists as opposed to the backpackers. ,laos,dgw7xnt,4,t5_2ro7e
