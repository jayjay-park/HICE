1399712,0,t3_2a1r2r,Hey everyone! Your earthquake perspective here  Caught me just before bed timeWhat you need to know UPDATED  GMTMagnitude Currently sitting at a . on the moment magnitude scale. The USGS has downgraded this quake to a . not a big drop unfortunately.Depth . km deep . miles  Quite a deep quake but this depth could be revised as more data comes in. New data suggests the quake occurred at a depth of km . miles making this a much shallower quake than before.Location km km NEE of Puerto Madero MexicoMercalli Intensity Scale Rating USGS has rated this quake at a VII on the Mercalli intensity scale. This translates to very strong shaking with moderate damage expected.Did you feel it rating This is an opinion based rating so please keep this in mind. Locals are rating this at a Mercalli scale of VIII which translate to severe shaking with the potential for moderateheavy damage. Its still very early on so the few reports they have hold higher power. As more reports come in this should show a truer opinion of the quake.Expected Fatalities Here are the expected fatalities statistics  no fatalities  for  fatalities  for  fatalities  for  deaths  for  fatalities and finally  for k deaths.   uURPerfect cites AP reporting two confirmed fatalities  expect more.Expected Damages Here are the expected costs from the quake. All values given in USD.  for less than m  for m  for m  for mb  for b and  for b   uplanninglady cites Guatemalan TV for damaged roads and buildings in Guatemala with collapsed homes and a shopping centre. People are outside and not wanting to go back in which is understandable. Power is out in Quetzaltenango. Tsunami No Tsunami has been generated by this earthquake. NOAA has reported registering the quake but not registering any data to signal an impending pacific wide tsunami. It does however remind us that these quakes can cause local tsunamis sometimes and to be aware.Recently Ive launched an attempt to make this part of my full time job. Id love to be able to report on things for reddit and make sure you get the real story with appropriate updates! Id really appreciate it if you could check out my inprogress website  www.theearthquakeguide.com  Im currently writing up guides and posts and rewriting the content on there to be more friendly and reflect myself more. There is a guide to building an emergency kit on there with product recommendations as close to my own products as possible. Id appreciate feedback of what you would want to see from this website! Ill be up for a little bit longer answering any questions!Stay Safe!TheEarthquakeGuySource ,Earthquakes,cirqg7c,1,t5_2qqp6

9276790,0,t3_57h46k,I found this to be a well written summary of earthquake predictionforecasting where we stand scientifically and what makes a successful predictionforecast. I also recommend reading the September  report by the National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council that the author cited. This is important because earthquake prediction and forecasting are brought up on social media often and I would like to see that interested people like subscribers of rearthquakes have access to the most recent and pertinent information on this subject.,Earthquakes,d8rwe57,2,t5_2qqp6
