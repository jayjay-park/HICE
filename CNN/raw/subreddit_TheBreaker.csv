5824550,0,t1_cxj44lz,Why Sosul stays is a good question. Honestly theres a part of me that thinks Kaiser has something on her or has some kind of trump card we dont know about. Possibly hes murim too. I have little fan theory that hes Sosuls dad but I dont have a lot of evidence for that short of superficial resemblance based on the lower half of their face  which is the only part we see of either of the two.Then again maybe shes being controlled or her memory has been erased with the same kind of drugs that the SUC and AD used.,TheBreaker,cxj4go8,1,t5_2w0y1
