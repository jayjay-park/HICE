527898,0,t1_cfy4lvm,gtPeople who play this game primarily to fly planes or drive tanks are at the mercy of a whole bunch of shit that means they might have to wait ten minutes to pull another tank pull another lib whatever  they could be out of resources and the right territory and that might ruin it for them for the half an hour or the night or whatever.Likewise people play this game to primarily ground pound as well and without counters all you are is food for vehicle whores.  Sure theres the oh shit moment occasionally when your shiny new prowler is destroyed by an AV mana turret  pixel big in the distance but really just because it cost resources does that really give the right to be an invulnerable farming machine?A lot of us remember back in the age of HE spam and Zepher libs....the ground game was absolutely awful.Just to be clear I use vehicles regularly esfs prowlers lightnings whatever.  However I also love the infantry game and am a proponent of experiencing all that a game like this has to offer rather than limiting myself to just one thing.  That includes using anything a pilot or tanker considers cheesy or dishonorable to prevent myself from being a free lunch.

Im still confused as to why the buff against AP damage was needed given how badly they need to be flying to be regularly killed by such.It doesnt matter that theyre supposed to be a hard counter to tanks they counter them by being where they cannot be attacked by tanks not because they have as much durability as an MBT you dont get into a straight slugging match with a heavy ground vehicle in an aircraft.

Its dropped only because I stopped giving a shit.In short were lacking coordination at every level From squad to platoon to command.,Briggs,cgtm9ej,3,t5_2xzvh

ZFOD run casual platoons that aim to have fun and crashing switching continents and then playing log inside for  minutes isnt fun and definitely discourages the casual player from coming back to planet side. And also I was crashing on every switch meaning I was away from platoon lead for  minutes trying to login during the early alert and then after the alert which was kind of a more selfish reason.,Briggs,cgzzyjk,1,t5_2xzvh

If Vanu have low pop and we getting zergedsmashed we give up and look for a fun fight anywhere. It really rather sucked for the first time in a while I heard commanders asking for help on the alert it sucked to say that we couldnt come and help out cuz crashin However now that we can safely switch again Ill be there fo sho! Dare I say..... I might have to stop running private squads and open up some pubby squads. Please NCTR I know that squads of vanu on an alert is a strange thing but it sucks that you both want to fight us and send everything at us please dont forget to fight against the biggest threat. Maybe Im high or something but I have seen  person squads of each pushing VS trying to get as much territ as possible quickly before fighting eachother. Youll all complain that we dont go but thats what we are immediately greeted with.NB Great to see some RSNC jump on VS with us and fight against the masses too. Would be great to see some other TR and NC high BRs jump on to VS for alerts and give the zergs some stiff competition.NB  Guttered to hear about TCFB low numbers of recent  Maybe some combined alert ops could be arranged?,Briggs,ch0mwca,1,t5_2xzvh

936217,0,t1_chaocw4,gt Wouldnt it make more sense to prevent the victor from having more territory?It makes as much sense as the fact NC had a platoon attacking us instead of the VS.Towards the end of the alert TR were losing seven territories at once. NC had two  forces ghostcapping TRs territory while also a larger force was capturing a base where some TR were trying to save. I actually went over there to one of those ghost caps and asked in yell chat why they were attacking us instead of the VS and the response I got was that they were just going for second place. In light of that decision why should TR be the ones who focus on VS and let NC get more territory? And Im saying that as one of the TR who was focused primarily on the VS for the entire alert.The Sungrey fight seemed to be the only meaningful fight that NCVS had the entire alert looking at it from TRs perspective.

Playing with IB in my opinion is more fun and I found that we got more stuff done.The trouble with a platoon is that its like herding cats sometimes. Nero does this very well. And having that cohesiveness and correct composition is only going to be seen on the likes of ops nights when theres enough members willing to fight objectively that this will be achieved.A piece of advice from me for R with their scaledown  when running a platoon get your squad leaders to micromanage if running objectively. Say you might have two squads going for the point and one squad nailing spawn solutions. Sure the A pointers might get slammed but thats a distraction to get rid of spawn solutions which is why guarding a sundie is a good thing to do.

It would have been ok had you said them seperately. Like im eating tropical fruit and im asian. Much like picard calling people asian and having skin dicks.

1693369,0,t1_cjsd369,Personally i changed my own policy of trusting another player with the keys to the outfit and that was a mistake i wont be doing that again. At the end of the day i have to run this ship others simply dont care about CIVZ as much as i do. Whilst we have people that are super dedicated we also get people that have low moral and mental issues that i simply cannot control what they say and think however ridiculous that might be. I clearly state in our outfit recruitment thread that at CIVZ its what you make it. But people expect too much from the outfit and have high expectations of others without thought to what they could contribute in a positive fashion. We had a lot of negativity come from those core players and as far as im concerned i want positive and responsive members if people are going to bitch and moan all the time than good riddens.The player base seems to fight each other and not get along when i am not around and i cant control peoples relationships with each other. My commitment is to the outfit and its members. If people want me on  that isnt going to happen. So people just need to learn to get along and work out viable solutions. Which I was working on unfortunately people have very sensitive feelings like little girls and i cant help that.The leadership structure is that i am the boss and after me there is room for squad leaders to step up when i am not around or if i need a break.Others will only have the powers to recruit members i cannot trust people with abilities like kicking people. We were under threat to be disbanded because some members wanted to change the name. And i wont be risking that again.We will bounce back i always bounce back cant help myself.The exodus is still largely a mystery. As only a couple of people told me why they left everyone else just followed the prominent personalities.That is why i am stating outright here on Reddit that i dont have a grudge to anyone personally and if anyone wants to return they can.

As such VS took over lead by a couple of percent.With about  minutes left on the alert ourselves RIP and a couple of other outfits including SOCA I think? were doing enough to keep TR on the attack on most lanes but we just didnt have the population to finish the caps as we had an unnecessarily large force of TR sitting at Octagon plus we had about  population compared to both NC and VS sitting at . So I got in orders and leader and did my best to get those at Octagon to push out. I dont know if it was my encouragement which got them to do so but a minute or so later they were actually helping us push through a couple of those bases and we got back to a  lead against the VS at . In the last couple of minutes VS were attacking two of our bases which would have given them back the lead but we managed to save both and hold on for the victory.,Briggs,clwkqpg,2,t5_2xzvh

Sometime after mblades forms oxsalthough this seems much later I cant really place the date  SOGA renames to SOCA.  KOL dies.

Beyond this I started to not give a fuck and took long breaks in between runs so I dunno what happened. Some useful info IIW and VFD regularly fought each other as competing special ops outfits.

2927822,0,t3_2toiw6,Its just another case of Bushidoside...For some reason some players think that this game should only be played in a certain fashion with particular sets of tools and tactics.  Be it either no antiair lockons no Maxs or in this case no shotguns and so on.  These people havent yet come to the realisation that they are playing the wrong game as whatever gives you the most fun and allows you to win by achieving your objectives Securing Territory or KDR are the only legitimate ways to play this game.I personally find it rather perplexing that many people just play one particular classvehicle with certain loadouts and then rage when they get owned by the counter tools and tactics that are available in this game which are there to keep things balanced.Bottom line many people feel like a failure each time they get killed not realising that death in this particular game means very little as it only keeps you out of the fight for a few seconds.  Also many Newbs dont realise this which can make them rage quit the game permanently when veterans use high KDR enabling cheese against them. ,Briggs,co0wjv1,6,t5_2xzvh

3256406,0,t3_2xbrzq,It is fairly easy to be get great stats lots of kills and the best score. There are a whole bunch of cheese mechanics you can exploit with ease. Along with that I reckon focusing a lot and playing solo given you have a good setup hardware wise is the key. I find myself constantly performing better when I dont have to communicate and listen in on ts. And about the skill limit I feel exactly the same. But then again it goes back to focus and hardware setup. Ive recently changed my sensitivity and try to actually give a shit when playing and have noticed quite a big jump in my stats not really a stat person but if thats a measure then sure. So people are imo constrained by their thought process but then again its relatively easy to get switched on.

After winning the alert he congratulated everyone for their help and then we all chilled at the WG for the last minute.  That comes from DavyJonesBooty on the VS who has led platoons and squads that I have been in and who has played a valuable role in platoons and squads that I have led and so I trust his account. Im mindful that others have presented abombernation in a Jekll and Hyde light however and so whilst he might have positive motivations for platoon leading theres likely negative ones as well.gtAsk the HMMR outfit that lost many members when he began kicking anybody from that outfit from PUBLIC platoons... Upon lead he kicked  full squads of HMMR members and began randomly kicking people until there was  people left in the platoon.Also in the thread mentioned above One of hammertimes best methods of tracking abombernation when we were tking him was looking at the map and finding out where the TR were performing the worst.An entire outfit was actively tracking the guy when he was leading platoons specifically to TK him and youre not only saying that I should speak to them to find out what HIS motivations are for platoon leading youre also presenting him kicking HMMR members from his platoon as being unreasonable?gt To TK him isnt to destroy the platoon either. Its to keep platoons alive.Really? Cause originally you said that putting bullets in him makes him kick everyone from the platoon. How does harassing the guy when you know it will result in everyone being kicked from the platoon result in saving the platoon? gt People have had their differences and there was tension against him but hes not letting it go.

Multiple continents where untill you realise all the buildings are the same you got so lost. Such large scale fights. Territory meta and the old alert system. Now I am just jaded old man. Love Server smash. Enjoyed farmers dispite struggling to field a team. Do not care about auraxiums. Stat whore accounts that last a day or . Deleted my accounts multiple times to try and end the addition. For some reason I just keep playing.

Most likely we will be outnumbered and get destroyed as has happened in all of our recent server smash losses.You would be better off not full contesting air dominance and planing a strategy around that.

The fact that these same fights still can go up to  mins means that even after half way through the cap where scu is vulnerable with previous mechanic people werent spamming maxes to get to the SCU.Fine not always people are going for the SCU so then why would you be worried about your good fights? Even if it were made vulnerable early on in a fight as long as these fights have equal pop there shouldnt be a problem for defenders to hold onto said fight.Like I raised before the main thing to be argued would be how long it takes for an SCU to go down rather than the mechanic itself.

By nature however it is an indication of either a certain bais in aiming or how you control your recoil. You are more likely to kill with a headshot than a bodyshot so you likely headshot more regardless as not all targets are at full health.

And on top of that its fun to play in if you arent lagging. We ran our team on the threshold of performance and community participation. Thats what we wanted and many reps pushed for.

As for being too spammable I argue they are just where they need to be given how easy it is to take them outnegate their effects.  Not to mention they are literally the only thing that makes an infiltrator worth taking up a squad slot.  EMPs are great for breaching but youd be better served by concussionflash grenades on a heavy.My response about your comment about my infiltrator playtime was simply illustrating that trying to use that as an indicator about the validity of my opinion is retarded.

6166334,0,t1_cyqca86,Sniping is pretty bad now I tried to make it work but its basically worthless to bother with the BTX as it forces an energy pack It would be okay with a thrust pack but as it stands the throwing knives do its job better without a downside and the Phase Rifle is only useful within m of the flag stand as using rage to instantly refill your energy is required in order to kill anything in a timely manner since even with rage it takes three shots to kill a light.This makes sniping in the midfield onehundred percent useless and some maps are completely not viable to snipe on due to no decent nests within that m range. Against better cappers the only way to kill them is to pray your defenders deal at least  damage to the capper shoot them before they grab the flag and then shoot them immediately again with the refill from rage.Dont even bother shooting at anything that isnt a light they take ages to kill and picking up one nugget makes all of a snipers work worthless.TLDR Using a sniper rifle as a main weapon is worthless and using it as a secondary weapon is even more of a joke.

Perhaps I misunderstood that what do you define as a top outfit? You seem to think that outfits with standards should be lowering said standards but outfits like ICE are bad. PS certainly has a lot of problems with both player attraction and player retention what youre saying is that population and player retention is the responsibility of the players and the community and to some extent it is.It becomes our responsibility because the game struggles to retain players in particular Briggs but that responsibility cannot and should not be shouldered by every BR nor are they stupid for not doing what you suggest.

Anyone who gets on their high horse claiming some groups are bad for noobs and others are good for the server etc etc are just grandstanding and scape goating because beating on someone specific for problems out of their control is what people do.

6403073,0,t3_436iyj,Im sorry but what youre asking doesnt exactly fit in this game.Bit of a jumble below possiblytldr is its a unique sandbox game where new players have to meet the experienced players halfway and actually want to be taught and learn which most dont.In other consolearcade style FPS game that have minimal sandbox opportunities and elements then yes youd have a point.This game doesnt cater very well to those that cant think for themselves and is well know that it has a bit of a steep learning curve. Thats part of what makes it the game we all love because we wanted a bit of a challenge and something different from all the other washed out clone shooter games out there. I think youll find that most of the experienced outfits do quite a lot for this game and new players but being a sandbox game it requires a lot of skills and qualities that you use in the real world when meeting people applying for jobs working etc. Its a two way street and you have to be prepared to meet halfway! Most of these new players either dont want to do that or are at this point in their lives incapable of doing so and frankly there is nothing even the most experienced player can do for them. This isnt babysitterside  but youll find most outfits are willing to put a considerable amount of effort into helping and teaching but the new player in question actually needs to want to learn to be interested and focused on improving and fitting in etc.I have ran many many public platoons in the past been very interactive with its members micro managed them taught them many things about the games mechanics the flow etc. Only a handful actually stood up and said I want more of this can I join your outfit. Now why when I spend countless hours putting time and energy into helping people would I want to keep doing that for those that arent actually interested? Most of the older established outfits are now pretty full of very experienced leaders who like myself have put so much into this game and the new player base but there is only so much you can do. At some point the new players have to stand up and walk. They have to want whats being offered and they have to look for it. ,Briggs,czhgqay,3,t5_2xzvh

7666391,0,t1_d3cpdvs,gt I disagree Well there was more than one point made..gt and youve not addressed my point. if you kill  guys and at the end of the engagement you have  health and you still have an objective to hold or take the th guy you come accross shouldnt be able to just  hit you and move on.I thought I had addressed it but heres an expanded version..Well the reason that a player is down to  was that they incurred damage trades that ate into their health pool not just the regenerating shield pool. Part of the skill is managing that through skill in the game positioningpredicting flowvarious class and aim skills etc. etc..gt th guy you come accross shouldnt be able to just  hit you and move onThe way you are looking at the issue is a bit focused on very specific bits rather than the whole issue.With any type of aid there will obviously be scenarios when that aid comes to the fore. Those situations can have the full range of being decisive to objectives.For instance if there was an aimbot weapon attachment slot activated mode toggle this would be an efficient way to use the minimum bullets to kill. Perhaps once activated it would consume resources.For guns that have limited magazine size before needing to reload its possible to identify scenarios like  there were  players to kill at a point with a very short time before a base was lost. Without activating the aimbot mode a player might be able to kill  of them but not be able to finish the th with a small magazine size or perhaps fewer bullets left from previous engagements. With aimbot mode a player might conserve the few bullets needed to finish the remaining player and achieve the objective.So the question now becomes is this a desirable mechanic to have and would the player in question be better off?Aimbot attachment lowers the skill ceiling. Aimbots can also be used by the opposition. On average the effect is to make the player weaker with respect to the opposition because that aimbot boosts the opposition more than the player. Enemies get all the skill boosts related to reflexesmuscle memoryrecoil managementCoF managementburst length calculation based on distance as well as bullet conservation skillsreload management while the player being able to aim pretty well just gets a boost to a little bit of bullet conservationreload management they dont have.Whats easy to overlook are all the instances of when the aid would benefit the opposition. There will be plenty of times when enemies  benefit from aimbot and these will eclipse benefits to the player. The times when enemies benefit will include times decisive for objectives. gt th guy you come accross shouldnt be able to just  hit you and move on.Going back to medkits  there will be a lot of instances when the enemies have partial health due to previous events and the player can get very small damage trades as a result  and get comfortably more than  kills while securing objectives. Every instance when players find themselves hurt also happens to enemies but at the moment this info isnt visible on the death screen so its not observable.The difference is if a player has better positioningpredicting flowvarious class and aim skills etc. and can manage using the shield system in a balance system without medkits that player would stand out more.TLDR The boot ends up on the other foot too and it ends up on the other foot more often as a player becomes more skilled so theres a net benefit to skilled players. Because the system is PvP the strength from a mechanic is useless on its own. Its the strength in terms of how it affects different player types across two sides compared to each other that matters for balance.This is all speaking from the perspective of pointing out that theres no net loss overall and a gain to skilled players.The most fundamental issue with medkit balance is that in a system with broken stats this puts players in a situation where have to give up on contributing to a sides success to boost broken stats.,Briggs,d3dmi5k,2,t5_2xzvh

Most people dont know how to disengage while chugging medkits so the lack of aiming ability from most people doesnt matter a whole lot. Like Ill still be able to mow down any random pubbie that starts chugging kits but if someone like Spud or Chilly does it Ill probably let them go. The movement is part of the whole thing and someone that can do it well is nigh on impossible to kill.

Ideally this is meant to be paired with Jammer rounds being introduced although Id be happier if spotters received a rework. Spotters are the stronger and more problematic of the two they can shift a fight a lot easier than an EMP grenade and theyre free. EMP spam or grenade spam in general is never really pleasant though especially considering the generous radius on it.

11542820,0,t1_dg4d5ce,Tking another faction on their own faction by switching is inherently wrong because its not suppose to be part of the game . Playing the game with the tools given is alright however  technically the tker is still in the wrong as I did not switch or tk I just played the damn game .,Briggs,dg4dpag,1,t5_2xzvh
11562747,0,t1_dg46dou,But switching factions to team kill because you are losing is not playing the game normally right? I highly doubt the game was designed that way.You can agree with that at least?,Briggs,dg6n4pu,-2,t5_2xzvh

11573397,0,t1_dg7u0a2,Think Axis was trying to say the TRVS fight over Hvar North to Quartz and some attempts for Allatum over at least the first hour I was on and earlier in the night but I dont know. Once we lost Allatum to the VS stealing it from our pushprogress on it who had no intention of moving out of the biolab or the NC for the previous half hour they owned it we went middle of the map and then up to dahaka hoping to draw some pop away instead of trying to crack allatum again since it was shutdown. But yeah were just fucking shitcunts for going somewhere else hey.  ,Briggs,dg7umr1,3,t5_2xzvh

11702717,0,t3_66z8o0,Ill have to agree with you on this one went from  HSR on the betelgeuse to  on the Polaris not to mention how crap his reaction time is if you get the drop. Is exceptionally good at spotting cloaked infils from afar its really weird. Theres also FatherTVT who I think is almost certainly hacking headshotting fully cloaked infils consecutively from  metres away. Doesnt look like BattleEye did much.,Briggs,dgmiskh,7,t5_2xzvh
11718894,0,t1_dgoc5dk,Yeah I know exactly what you mean played at a friends place on my character and I seemed to be able to survive more on his ADSL ms ping than at home on my ms cable. Had a lot less instances of dying to people who have a slither of health left as well which is the bane of my existence. I notice when it happens on my connection that the final couple shots that would have finished them off dont even register probably because Im already dead on their screen. I always assumed that having a lower ping in games like this would give you and advantage if anything but with this game it feels like a handicap. ,Briggs,dgod5wj,2,t5_2xzvh
11720794,0,t1_dgok95u,The irony is once again strong with this one.It wouldnt be the first game to implement a ping limit. Heck even DBG have put a ping limit on King of the Kill. It isnt racist to put a ping limit on. You could question racism if it was not placing a server that was valid due to ethnicity religion etc but I guarantee that an Asian specific server doesnt exist primarily due to lack of a large enough demand. Irony there being HZ is more popular in Asia than it is in NA.A ping limit would be in the interest of not just fair and balanced play but also primarily fun and fair play but you have already made it abundantly clear that fun play for all as an idea is completely out the window if it interrupts your personal fun. A ping limit may not kill the server either case in point is that Connery is hemorrhaging players due to frustration cause by high ping players.,Briggs,dgokxng,4,t5_2xzvh
11723849,0,t1_dgogoi7,Theres a little bit more to it than that. Commissioner has higher alpha meaning if youre shooting a wounded target or swap from primary its more likely to net an instant kill. Of course if you didnt get that first shot finisher then the underboss gets a followup a lot sooner. OHKs on nonarmour cloakAux Infils is attractive but the same rule applies to heavies with HK headshots. Both work really well in a lot of situations the underboss can have the same number of shots to kill and it does it faster it does however suffer more against heaviesNW if you arent landing headshots. It really is pretty important to pace shots with the commi and to give a somewhat arbitrary figure If you cant hit at least  accuracy with it its probably not the best option for you. Solid points though Id agree with the commissioner being better at range but how it fares in CQC is more up to the user and the scenario.,Briggs,dgoxfsu,8,t5_2xzvh
