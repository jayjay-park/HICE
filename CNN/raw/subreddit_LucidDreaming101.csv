Once you become lucid you can then control the nightmare and confront the thing youre having an issue with.However you choose to deal with the nightmare at that point is up to you. From what Ive heard there are two thoughts on the matter. The first is that you walk up to the thing that is causing the nightmare and embrace it with love. You can hug it or even absorb it into you as everything in the dream is a manifestation of your mind. The other school of thought would be to beat up and capture the thing causing the nightmare i.e. overpower it.I dont really have nightmares so I dont have experience with this. Everything above is what Ive read myself. Like I mention in the videos if you can Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming I believe has an entire chapter devoted to this and Im sure there is plenty more about it on the web. LaBerges technique was the first one by the way. In more serious circles of people his technique seems like it worked best but from random browsing of forums the second one seems to be more popular and efficient. As a side note some people actually try to use nightmares to trigger lucidity otherwise known as NILD.Although not precisely a nightmare I have had some dreams that were kind of scary or infuriating whereupon I became lucid. For me the moment I become lucid the bad parts of the dream almost always fade away.Wow so this turned into a really long post. Honestly for SP Im not that familiar with being stuck in it. Personally it doesnt freak me out and I find it kind of cool. If it is a really big deal to you then I suggest avoiding any of the techniques that use it particularly WILD. My only other suggestion is to embrace it and when you are stuck in SP think positive thoughts and try to enjoy it.If anyone who has learned to overcome either fears of SP or overcome their nightmares through lucid dreaming wants to comment feel free to.,LucidDreaming101,ci86axh,3,t5_3241e
