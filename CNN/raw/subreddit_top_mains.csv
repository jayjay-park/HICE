AP mage Adc Assassin Tank Bruiser Anything. Good qualities for toplane is dueling power sustain and the ability to support diving. With items as of now anyone can get those qualities.If you find a champion fun and youre not sure where you get to play it as you want. Top is a good place for it.,top_mains,dcel1hb,2,t5_3ihvx

Against most match ups I start with e for easier harass and a guaranteed thunderlords proc on auto e auto though q start allows you to push the wave for an even earlier level . If you can poke them down enough and you have ignite you will probably get an easy kill against most melee match ups or at least force them to flash and recall. Ooor theyll play super safe and have  cs  minutes into the game like the last platinum Renekton I played against. ,top_mains,dcgyeef,2,t5_3ihvx
10348329,0,t3_5o2ukp,I love this matchup as Nasus. Once I outscale him he cant stay in lane anymore and I try to kill him whenever my ultimate it up. You just cant die to him early is all. ,top_mains,dch1jz2,1,t5_3ihvx
