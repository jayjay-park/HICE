4312131,0,t1_csbj707,There is no Cache you are in full control what you want to host if you dont want to store a site anymore you can delete it on the ZeroHello interface.Maybe in the future  if we have more peers  it would be possible to define optional files for the site eg. images videos witch is stored in a Cache folder and the client deletes the most served ones when he runs out of space.,zeronet,csbpc21,1,t5_35uue

6050555,0,t1_cy49qqg,You seem to though all about it and you are talking about running scripts in decentralized way...How about database how this will run in a decentralized way and sync all the data between peers? There is no easy way to do this!,zeronet,cycqay9,1,t5_35uue

7300975,0,t3_4fcm86,ZeroNet built for dynamic content so js is necessary. Every site is served from same host ... so sandboxed iframe and restricted js api is necessary to load every page to avoid sameorigin security problems.,zeronet,d282koq,2,t5_35uue

8431709,0,t3_4v3yza,The biggest issue I see is that ZeroNet requires the CLI or at least it does for me on macOS. As amazing as this project is it wont see any significant adoption until nondevelopers can download an app click on it and it just starts working. Until then ZeroNet will just be a neat little toy for us nerds.,zeronet,d5vi639,3,t5_35uue

9186254,0,t1_d8gdumd,Merger sites are more like shared databases rather than actual sites. Both Zeronet sites would have to be designed to connect to the same merger sites in order to share data that way.,zeronet,d8gfatx,2,t5_35uue
9754717,0,t1_dafbf76,Interesting design choice. A bit like MAC randomization. But with DPI without obfuscation its pretty easy to tell who is running what. ,zeronet,dafhk0v,1,t5_35uue
