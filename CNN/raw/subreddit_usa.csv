4703821,0,t3_3ck1p7,The problem and issues regarding gun ownership in my opinion are There is the argument that we could save lives  this would be OK but the fact of the matter is that in the US we simply dont believe all lives are equal. A criminal rapist sociopath on crack with  illegitimate kids he doesnt take care who commits robberies with a knife is worthless and a man walking to his car on the way home from work to support his  children is worth far more. If he shoots the knife guy then it is a life but in the act of killing him he could have saved the lives of  more people or at least he saved the money and possibly the livelyhood of a carpenter whos tools would have been stolen causing him to lose his house because he cant work and now has to forfeit the contract costing him thousands and now he has no money or tools because of knife weilding crackhead.You can get meat for your family if youre poor for virtually nothing. Meat at the supermarket is grey about  a pound at the cheapest filled with hormones and antibiotics that are safe whereas venison from a deer can stock your freezer for literally months for a few cents per pound. Approx  lbs of meat for . cents.Guns are fun they bring people together. Ever shot one? Its like using a nail gun but you can make a can fly away from yds. the news in this country always reports accidental deaths and shootings like theyre rampant but if you look at the statistics theyre insignificant completely insignificant. In reality more people are killed by police while trying to kill them. Most criminals in the USA dont even use a gun and if they do its loaded because they know if they kill someone in the commission of a robbery or someone is killed at allincluding the robbers friend it goes from  years for armed robbery to usually the death penalty. Youre EXTREMELY more likely to be killed on your way to the gun store in your car by a drunk driver or die of emphysema from all that smoking you do. The UK has the same amount of KNIFE ATTACKS as the US has shootings and the population of the UK is  TIMES LOWER! People die just as often from knife attacks they like to think you have a chance against someone with a knife but you dont. Because knifes hurt more than guns believe it or not. I feel safer with a gun in my pocket. Knowing that if a bipolar schizophrenic chases me with a sharpened screwdriver I can shoot him a few times before he gets my eyes and likely the next guy wont get stabbed too.He wont take my gun because Im in the military.Im better than that. Most people forget something like th of Americans are military veterans.,usa,ctngcuk,1,t5_2qh7p
4760824,0,t3_3ey6f0,Its very very expensive to go to university here! I would suggest that you go to a community college not as prestigious as big colleges like the university of washington or harvard etc but they still get the job done. Unless you have a lot of money saved and an offer for a decentlypaying job here already then it will be very difficult to pay tuition.Im sorry to say this but it might be a good idea to immigrate find a good job and save up money before going to school here. Although not as bad as greece by a long shot its still somewhat difficult for young people to find jobs here especially during the summer when college and high school students are hired for many service and restaurant jobs.What I would do if I was you is I would try to make contacts in the US first. Become friends with people look for opportunities and jobs and scholarships in the US in the mean time while saving as much money as you can until you can move here. Once you have a Plan B if everything goes wrong For example if you dont find a job and you end up homeless your new american friend might have offered you a place to stay then it would be a great time to move here.Good luck to you!

The only catch is that you need to use the skills you learned in college to the benefit of the nation I.E. work for the state departments various foreign and domestic aid sectors and as long as you borrow entirely Or at least primarily from the government they will remove your debt.This is good for both you and the country.  The United States is able to continue providing cheap and decisive foreign aid maintaining its image around the globe.  And it also gives you the ability to gain infield experience which if you worked for the state department is an INCREDIBLE asset on your resume arguably as good or better then having retired vet on your resume.So knowing that I find free education past high school absolutely ludicrous because then colleges will start being required to meet national standards to receive funding which would significantly impact their effectiveness at providing the learning experience they currently do.,usa,d9wxazu,1,t5_2qh7p

11610036,0,t3_65o4ti,First and foremost most Americans dont go to Europe because it isnt presented as an option unless youre rich.Most Americans dont even have a passport so thats a barrier as well.But we have thousands of schools in the United States to choose from.  And for those that are poorer many go to community college for  years and then transfer to larger schools and get a diploma from there.  That gives them a name brand diploma which is ultimately what we care about.  And that saves thousands of dollars.Further even if you know about European schools you have to factor in travel costs cost of the euro and standard of living and then an unfamiliarity with languages other than English as an issue.  Most Americans speak one language and could maybe go to Australia or England but would be royally screwed in France Spain Germany or elsewhere.Personally Ive studied abroad and it was a great experience.  But I went to Mexico and the cost of living was way lower so I got to live very well.  But even then I slight that out for a summer and forced it to happen.  It wasnt presented as an option and I had a full ride.Also we are typically busy in high school and have to make a school decision in a short time period.  We dont take gap years to figure things out.  We decide where were going to college during our final year of high school and start  months post graduation three days post graduation for me because I am crazy and started in the summer.  If there was more time and education to consider foreign options Im sure some would go abroad.  But its not as easy for us as it is for Europeans.,usa,dgc0ahv,7,t5_2qh7p
