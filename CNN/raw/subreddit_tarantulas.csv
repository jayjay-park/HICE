But if we step away from my whole it MUST look real BS ideals I actually like it based on the colors. The greysilver color of the water bowl goes nicely with the green and the purple. As far as flow goes I would personally move the cup into the right corner and angle it out from there. This would free up a little more space and feel more natural especially looking in from the front which I am assuming is to the left based on the Dark Knight to the right.Otherwise it looks pretty species appropriate so no worries on that front either.  if the cup is moved for better flow.,tarantulas,cf9xnxo,2,t5_2sbwy

If you need to keep a relatively small space warm its just a few watts here and there.Most tarantulas are native to areas where itll dip into the s and even lower so long as youre comfortable even with a sweatshirt on they should be fine even without a heater.If you keep them on a book case you could put a sheet of plastic over the front and put a small incandescent light in the bottom. Put the Ts on the upper shelves and that bulb would convert almost all of its energy to heat. Use a thermometer to determine if you need to use a larger bulb or more insulation. Just make sure the bulb is in a fixture so its not going to touch anything and risk a fire.

3266008,0,t1_cp0jd8g,Thanks! I remember talking with you the other day saying I was leaning towards a GBB. Turns out the expo I went too had a seller who had about  of them.  were unsexed due to their size and then I saw this beauty. I can definitely saw shes quite skittish. Moving her enclosure makes her move quite a bit and any time I openclose the top latch albeit does make a lot of noise when Im forcing it to shut she jumps in surprise. I dont plan on handling her for awhile if at all just because of her nature and until I figure out how skittish shell be after she calms down a bit.I did actually get to handle her today though. Let me say this was the first time I a still slightly arachnophobia man handled a spider. It was completely not by choice either. I was transferring her from the small deli cup I bought her in into the enclosure I now have her in. I was doing this in my bathtub for the open space. As I opened her lid I didnt realize she had webbed it more than I imagined and so it pulled up the substrate along with her. She particularly didnt like this and I got to witness first hand just how lightning fast everyone has been saying this species can be. In the blink of an eye she bolted out of her container and landed half on the outside of her container and half on my hand. This scared the crap out of me and idk how I kept my composure but I managed to stay still and gently coax her back on the container and then into her enclosure all while mentally going holy crap. She also sprinted from one end of the enclosure to the other dead next to my hand as I was shutting the cage. Spooked me a little.Ive heard theyre quite the opportunistic eaters so I cant wait to watch her munch on a cricket. I put one in not too long ago but she hasnt touched it. I was debating waiting to let her settle down first but I heard it was ok so if its still in there by the time I get home from work tomorrow Ill take it out.Shes taken quite a liking to exploring all of her new den walking along the walls then the ceiling back on the walls on the ground back to the walls ect ect scoping out her home. Shes finally sit still for the first time in like  hours! Im assuming shes doing this as to start to place down her web that will soon encompass the rest of the inside.She is so beautiful though! The only thing I like more about her beauty is the fact that my mom is scared shitless from her.

3722936,0,t3_3302c1,I recently  days ago got a P. Subfusca LL and what was supposed to be a P. Regalis but ended up being a P. Vittata.  It had been hiding so the yellow on the legs wasnt visible when I got it home and it came out I saw it was missing the white abdomen band and yellow warning legs I launched an investigation into the differences.  I spent so much time trying to find any consistently reliable way of differentiating the different Poecilotheria I am in complete agreement with Richcymru about the genus the subtlety of the differences in color on these spiders is a counterintuitive way to ID many of them.  After clearing up the RegalisVittata thing I launched an investigation into my Subfusca just to make sure it was properly IDd as well.   I found numerous sites and boards that had pictures of each and listed differences what was frustrating was seeing my spider listed as both HL and LL depending on the site I was on no one was reliably accurate.  After hours and hours of researching and mostly only anecdotal evidence on the differences determined that unless youre trying to breed them pick a colorform you find attractive and dont sweat the Latin name too much.,tarantulas,cqgn2yc,2,t5_2sbwy

Ive heard a lot about Jamies Tarantulas and I really think she is a legit seller with great animals. From what I see she just breeds and sells them so it is  possible that she was told this by an importer that she buys from or from a middle man who was also lied to. If somebody that actually imports tarantulas tells you there is now an import ban you probably wouldnt question it. The ones exportingimporting the tarantulas seem to be the ones spreading this lie. Sadly there are quite a few black sheep that will do all kinds of things to maximize their profit.

You could purchase another Chilean Rose for about  for an unsexed spiderling.  You can also purchase an entire spiderling enclosure kit from her for about  and it includes everything you need.  The most expensive part is the overnight shipping though at .The url says mature male but thats not what this is.Ive had a few recommendations to use petcenterusa.com.  People say that Paul Becker does a great job.  His prices are cheaper too!  Ive never used this website before though so I cant vouch for it personally.  Ive only heard good things about it.

8402458,0,t3_4upxp8,Rose hairs are really a luck of the draw Ive seen many rose hairs and they were all very different spiders. Some would threat pose the second you touched there enclosures others were living rocks who didnt seem to mind when you cleaned up their place.  If you want something similar to the rose hair but are more docile by majority look into the curly hair tarantula.The Mexican red knee is also a good choice but theyre a little skittish so you have to be very careful if you decide to handle it it could get spooked and run off your hand. The bad side on the red knee is that it takes a very VERY long time to reach adult sizes. The curly hair takes a long time too but not as long. If you want a pretty looking but fast growing tarantula look up the avicularia avicularia or avicularia Metallica. All the avic species are beautiful theyre fast but not too fast and are not quick to bite. I would stay away from a few such as the avic urticans since theyre a little less docile. As for care and maintenance it would be easier to help you once you have a spider in mind but generally DO NOT OVER CARE. What I mean is as long as they have a water dish dry substrate and a cricket or two once a week they need nothing else. They are very hardy animals and can survive rough conditions what kills spiders is us trying to keep everything perfect when in reality they dont need much at all. If you decide to get an avic DONT STRESS ABOUT HUMIDITY. I live in Los Angeles and it is not humid here I have two avic species who I have kept on BONE DRY substrate. What is more important is VENTILATION a lot of holes going up and down their container and a big water dish is all they need. Every now and then Ill sprinkle some water on the substrate if its a particularly hot day but what kills avics is TOO MUCH HUMIDITY. If theres condensation in the enclosure walls ITS TOO HUMID youll kill your pet.Most ground dwelling species dont need anything but a small water dish and dry substrate with ventilation. ,tarantulas,d5ruqhx,6,t5_2sbwy

9388288,0,t3_595s7b,What a beauty! I dont have much experience with juveniles but Ill tell you about my experiences with my adult female.G. Rosea can be very picky with food. I have seen mine eat  crickets at once no joke! and then fast no food for as long as seven months. Just give him some food a few times a week. If hes hungry he will eat. If he looks bothered by the cricket scooting away and such take the cricket out and try again another time.Spiders like people have different moods and temperaments across individuals. Temper testing with the paintbrush on the hind leg is a great way to get a sense of his mood. Once they get into posturing it takes a while to calm down. Best to just leave him alone in that case. Rosea is a pretty docile species so I wouldnt be too worried about this event. I would be surprised if he actually bit at the brush. If he did then you know that maybe yours is a little bitey. In my experience they usually hold the posture for a while but dont bite for defense. More contact will help even his temper. But do remember that the spider will decide what kind of mood he is in not you. As you gain experience and confidence in handling you will find that you are increasingly able to judge your spiders mood. I handle my G. Rosea all the time. We have a great rapport! But when she postures or throws hairs shes saying that she wants to be left alone and I can disrespect that at my own risk.Another note Tarantulas are effectively blind. Their eyes can do little but discern light from dark. If you want him to get comfortable it is not advisable to redecorate often. I clean and redecorate about twice a year.I wish you and Hubert a long and happy time together! Enjoy!,tarantulas,d9615oj,1,t5_2sbwy

10145803,0,t3_5l7e5n,I think most beginner lists should be a bit more upfront about what beginner friendly means in the context of tarantulas. DO YOU PLAN ON HANDLING YOUR TARANTULA?If yes most beginner friendly list focus on tarantulas that are a bit more docile and less biteprone so look at one of those. Keep in mind that docile tarantulas might still act unpredictably or bite. If you DONT plan on handling your tarantula just get whichever one you think is the coolest as long as you can stomach getting bit by it because even if you dont handle it youre going to be tinkering with the tarrarium feeding it and so on so bites can still happen.Thats it. Some tarantulas are higher maintenance than other tarantulas but no tarantula is a lot of work compared to almost any other pet that people are used to. The most finickyaggressivehungry tarantulas that frequently get labeled for advanced keepers are still less work than a housecat even if you get  of the tarantulas and compare it to the one cat. Tarantulas just arent hard to keep. Im personally of the opinion that you shouldnt handle your tarantula since look how cool I am touching the creepy thing is probably one of the most common causes of deathescapes and dont benefit the tarantula in any way and that beginner guides that focus on handleability and docility just encourage that.That said everyone should keep their invertebrates however they like Im not going to make a fuss.
