Not sure what those four lines are below the header because only Home and School arent blacked out but you can probably delete that or if its address info format it like a normal address and put it somewhere in your header.Some stuff is a bit wordy. The thermo bullet point is a good example. Graded papers and provided tutoring for Thermodynamics I says the exact same thing.,EngineeringResumes,cq4aibo,1,t5_37mk2

10431643,0,t3_5m2gz8,Hey I would redesign the headings and change the wording. Im currently following formats like this. Also focus your bullet points in experience on results of your actions rather than what you did unless what you did was exactly what the job position is looking for. Under projects list every project as its own category and include about  bullet points underneath job experience outlining your top responsibilities and achievements to make room for the projects.The date of your first job on the resume shouldnt be misaligned from that first point under projects see how the project bullet point continues past it. Recruiters will find little things like that enough to toss out a resume before they read it in too much depth. I would also take out the fluent in Arabic part unless its relevant to the job positions youre applying to. Im not an expert on resumes myself but these things Ive learned from my coop office at school th year biotech engineering. ,EngineeringResumes,dcqhvco,1,t5_37mk2
