10881919,0,t1_de2d7gp,You havent watched Barrow Hill yet? Wow youre in for a treat!Killer Stones! I shall say no more. DBut yeah its been great to see his subscribers pretty much double in a year and now as a substitute I can use this subreddit to sorta sub! Dont really have any suggestions at the moment other than maybe getting his logo up in the banner or something...Maybe you could while checking thats cool suggest that he mentions this SR in his next video so people who didnt see your bit in the comment section can check it out?Anyway thanks again and I hope to contribute many inane comments and frankly pitiful puns in the future!,cjugames,de2e56y,1,t5_3iqcr
