Right now all you do is chat online and text  get him to visit downtown with you. Just starting a romantic relationship with him wont change his current behavior so you have to ask yourself if youd be happy with a boyfriend who never leaves sleeps all day and communicates only through electronic means. I speak from experience  I dated a fellow VERY introverted man for  months. Your description reminds me of him introverted stays home and never explores sleeps constantly witty very smart judgmental. I thought getting into a relationship with him would help him expand and I could draw him out of his shell. I was very unsuccessful and it ended poorly because I was unfulfilled in the relationship.  Just food for thought.  ,introverts,cfjoako,2,t5_2r74k
1440566,0,t3_2alopg,Im usually on time or no less than  minutes late to an appointment. I feel its disrespectful to others if I make them wait too long and I dont like waiting either so I try to be prompt. However Im rarely early. I remember reading a study where certain people preferred being late because they valued their time and didnt want to give it away by being early. I guess I fall into that mentality.,introverts,ciwunza,1,t5_2r74k

Tell them once that youre not interested.If they try again say Didnt we talk about this already?If they persist presumably because that tactic has worked on extroverts in the past try Buddy I am very tired right now and pestering me all day is not helping.If they really cant take a hint try negative feedback on the extrovert channel Your nagging is making me reconsider our friendship. accompanied by death stare,introverts,cptgas1,3,t5_2r74k
6000937,0,t3_3xnidc,Im lucky in the way that any time at home alone with my partner feels like recharge time. As long as we are at home I feel perfectly comfortable and am able to recharge with him as much as I would if I were alone. Is your wife aware of what an introvert is and what your needs are? Its a particularly difficult time of the year for us introverts. Its easy to be pushed over the edge right now but perhaps as difficult as it is this may not be the perfect time to address it. You have family commitments that you cant get out of so you might just have to grin and deal with it until after Christmas.  Your wifes family ARE coming and she is likely stressed about it all enough as it is. I wouldnt put this extra stress on your relationship right now. But maybe thats just me. After Christmas I think you need to try to set some boundaries with your parents too. ,introverts,cy694mg,3,t5_2r74k
6239060,0,t3_410bdi,Its definitely a challenge to find other people whose company I truly enjoy. But when it does happen its amazing! To me it feels like most people will be friends with just about anyone because they want friends...I on the other hand am selective and only very rarely find people that I want to spend time with. I want more friends but I want them to be people that are actually interesting to me. You gotta keep looking and find those people that truly interest you. They do exist. ,introverts,cyytb0c,7,t5_2r74k
8306812,0,t3_4t9sdy,Because you say hello and greet people you see and know on a regular basis. Its just the societal norm it can be draining but if its only a few times a day and youre basically alone for the rest of the time then does it really matter?You dont even have to respond with words every time just give them a nod and move on while looking busy. Seems to work for me a lot of the time and people will begin to understand that youre not always in the mood to talk.,introverts,d5fwpco,5,t5_2r74k
