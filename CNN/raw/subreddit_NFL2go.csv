5086912,0,t1_cuxf7o4,Just to add to thisI had unlocked a bunch of times previously each time saying it was successful.

Even if the yellow U is still present the game loads.Thanks for your tip!,NFL2go,cuz5z62,1,t5_39gr3

There is also a way to add Kodi to the AppleTV for unofficial sources but Im trying not to have to go through the hassle when the way I used it last year worked quite well for me personally. Im simply trying to find out if there is a way to see the direct stream URLs on the new site so that I can continue to use my unmodified platform. Worst case I still have AirPlay or ChromeCast but that ties up my cellphone as well. ,NFL2go,d66wkqu,3,t5_39gr3
