1215422,0,t1_ci65zv1,To clarify I said it has less RPG elements then the Souls games. To me there are two differences that I interpret as a reduction of the RPG element. First there is less diversity of weapons. All we have seen is the saw cleaver and blunderbuss in both the trailer and gameplay. To add to this all FROM has said about weapons is that the saw cleaver will change to adapt the play style. This leads me to believe that the saw cleaver will be the primary weapon of that class assuming there will be more then  class. This type of weapon choice is much more in line with an action games weapon options. Edit more weapons were shown in a new bit of gameplay. I still think there will be less options but its kind of up in the air for the moment.Second is that the option to play slow and defensively is going to be actively punished according to Miyazaki. This ties into there being less weapon options and that there are no shields in game which would lend to defensive play. Ideally In souls games neither aggressive or defensive combat are actively punished unless the players makes a mistake this does not seem to be the case for Bloodborne and the game will just punish people being overly cautious and defensive.,bloodborne,ci6cqhz,1,t5_31k9i

2920722,0,t1_co02bop,But from what weve been shown thus far that shouldnt be a factor anymore. The reason high level PVP was horrible was because you would have the necessary stats to wear tank armor and roll around using invincibility frames whilst having every spellhexmiracle in the game to buff your already broken character. It all was based around at least in my opinion the ability to take even more hits more so than their ability to dish them out. Given that there is no armor in Bloodborne that wouldnt be a factor and you would still need to personalize your build to be good using weapon that suit you playstyle and skill level. Since you cant just tank hits I would say Bloodbornes PVP could allow for more weapons. That isnt to say people will use them however...,bloodborne,co03fo5,1,t5_31k9i

Also while the DLCs were pretty good everything that both you and I have talked about is completely subjective. People dont treat DS as a leper we are just passionate about the series and dislike many decisions made in DS by the other team. Its completely understandable if you look at it objectively.

3399437,0,t3_2z52qt,Its not really about the mechanics what we enjoy about the game doesnt come from them. These are psychological games  what matters is the mindset you bring when you play it for the first time.   Play like you and the character are one and the same. If your character knows something its because you took the time to read a key description.   Play it like a detective something is a miss in Yarnham and whether or not you are the one to make a key decision in this realities future or whether you are merely a pawn of fate depends entirely on how much you figure out what is actually going on. Who is really pulling the strings and who can you really trust.If you are in a hostile environment you need to think of a way to ensure you can survive it. If you rush in and bash buttons like a video game you wont beat it.   You need to persevere and outwit the challenge before you.

3420323,0,t1_cpi38oo,For me its the loading screens unfortunately noticeable if you play on the pc and the number of weapons though that fear has been dissuaded somewhat with the justification that weapon classes in the past havent been as plentiful as we might have assumed. I assume a lot of players will have gone with a favourite weapon out of several due to either the weapon being objectively better or for moveset purposes  I like choice but my hope is that the moveset for each weapon will be highly refined and functional so that we dont feel like any particular weapon is any worse than it could be. Attire as well  it wouldnt be true fashionborne if there wasnt a plentiful degree of garbs to choose from but with the amount of effort put in to make the cloth truly clothlike has definitely paid off and having a huge amount of clothes might not be required anymore.

3448032,0,t1_cpl8ved,So while youre in the Hunters Dream there are little tombstone markers for your Chalice Dungeons. Five or six spots for them IIRC.When you approach one the Chalice editor pops up sorry NeverQuiteEnough there IS an editor menu and gives you options in creating a new Chalice Dungeon.This is where it gets neat. There are four types of dungeons to choose from I believe this is like a setting for what sort of zone it will be although it may be specific to the mob types or bosses... Im not sure once you have the corresponding Chalice. Major bossesi n the game drop these initial startup Chalices.Then you need the corresponding crafting materials Special Chalice Dungeon only crafting mats you find in the game quite rare to create the dungeon.While you are clearing the dungeon bosses may drop newer types of Chalices. These are the key ingredients on making more Chalice Dungeons in the future. You see the dungeons vary in depth and the harder a dungeon you complete the better a Chalice you may receive. Im not sure if theyre one use only or permanent but after completing one introduction dungeon run and killing the three bosses I had two new Chalices for that dungeon type in my editor menu to choose from. They each have a unique formula of crafting mats associated with them.Its a bit confusing but basically envision Chalice Dungeons    and . Now envision each of those having variations to craft so  would have a b c. Initially the game rewards you with a from the story boss but then clearing it you may loot b and c. When clearing c you may loot e. So on and so forth. I have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes.,bloodborne,cplavnx,4,t5_31k9i

Once the hype of replay dies down and it becomes mostly PvP a lot of people are going to be pretty pissed at having to run through hoping to find someone to help or beating a bossif they can on NG or beyond and keep the cycle going over and over just to fight each other for fun. The same goes for Chalice Dungeons the luster of them being randomly generated is going to lose its polish when it gets to the point of people constantly repeating the same thing over and over just to be able to do it with friends.I hope Im wrong or they make it easily available because as of know it seems like I could blow through an entire playthrough of Insight on PvP in  nights.,bloodborne,cpp4de8,1,t5_31k9i

Its got a decent distribution.Try to run and die to the first boss ASAP doing so will allow you to actually spend your blood echoes rather than losing them constantly.Learn to lure enemies to favorable spots for you.Read notes from others some of the advice can be decent.If youre having trouble with a boss use the bell charm you are granted. It will let someone come help you with it.Expect to fuck up terribly your first time around its totally fine. Youll begin to feel progress and see your skill go up and eventually everything that melted you will be on the other end of the treatment.Explore the area as much as you can. Early on its really good to stock up on things.If you see a lot of blood pools it means people died near there theres probably something dangerous you can see how they died. After awhile youll be able to tell common mistake pools and can just ignore them since youll be skilled enough to avoid dying to whatever caused those. Youll also learn to spot trap or nasty ambush blood pools and it will guide the way you go through an area. Learn to parry and Visceral counter. Learn to hit and run and pattern your attacks. Learn to burst things down sometimes the best strategy is just to go all in swinging. Run and heal if it looks bad. Running can also space mobs for you to fight. Molotovs are really powerful.

It is brutal and beautiful. I havent felt such levels of awesomeness when I downed the Cleric Beast without dying or finally killing the second boss after so many.The game doesnt babysit and hold your hand and in my opinion it is worth so much more than the  tag. Best game on the PS by far and it can and should be the reason to buy a PS.,bloodborne,cpq9ig1,2,t5_31k9i

Depth seemingly being a levelscale somewhat.Root chalices at least according to the description change the chalice dungeon every time you return I havent tested to see what exactly changesRegular chalices you do to unlock more depths  more other chalice types.Any chalice of a given depth will drop the materials to form the next depth it seems So to create a depth  you need materials from a depth  chaliceHope this helps,bloodborne,cpr5bux,1,t5_31k9i

3508483,0,t1_cprufi7, this. After wiping at cleric and realizing Id have to fight the twin wolves I tried out the sewers which took me back around to the beginning and the big shortcuts. How could he not find one of the two entrances to the sewer system in twelve goddamn hours? The beginning of the game is the most frustrating.

3510836,0,t1_cpsf36e,I like that its different. Its a huge callback to Demons Souls in that youre more concerned with clearing individual areas rather than bonfire farming.Warping between lamps is a QoL hit for sure but I think most people are playing the game with the wrong tenets in mind. Carrying over playstyles from dsds.My opinion on this may change when Ive put hundreds of hours into the game because at that point QoL issues become top tier but for now Im fine with it.,bloodborne,cpsgjil,0,t5_31k9i

3513950,0,t1_cpsrtb3,Youre too focused on inyourface story being an integral part of a game. It doesnt have to be. You asked where the hype is and I told you. Like I said if you need that kind of story for a game to be enjoyable then this probably isnt for you. Im just here to tell you that a lot of people dont care about a storyline being front and center if the game is fantastic otherwise. Thats why Bloodborne has gotten hype. Because it does so many things better than so many other games. Story presentation isnt one of them but give me gameplay over story any day of the week. Id rather have more Bloodbornes than more The Order s. One nitpick towards the end I dont consider Bloodborne hack and slash. That implies a degree of mindless buttonmashing and this game is anything but that. I like most of the games youre talking about and Im not dissing them. Games like Bloodborne are for the hardcore gamers though. The ones that dont want the game to tell them what to do. You say Skyrim doesnt hold your hand but thats just wrong. There are tutorials waypoints etc. And thats not a bad thing! I loved Skyrim. But some people like that blind exploration myself included. In Skyrim I activate my waypoint and follow it. In Bloodborne I have to figure it all out on my own. Its a level of challenge rarely seen in video games today. You seem very focused on the story. This is not that kind of game so if thats all youre looking for you will absolutely be disappointed. ,bloodborne,cpstdnh,3,t5_31k9i

The designworldart style seem perfect and the differences from the souls series more aggressive gameplay different weapon system etc should help it feel fresh. I loved DkS but towards the end it was all starting to feel a little familiar. This seems like a good change up to the formula and I love the gothic victorian style setting.Thanks again for explaining so well I might just try and deny myself for another week or so before caving and getting it   Happy hunting. ,bloodborne,cpt8b91,3,t5_31k9i

3522256,0,t1_cptr39p,Correct the higher the grade E lt D lt C lt B lt A lt S the more bonus damage you get from that stat. All trick weapons start off as pure physical and will usually scale with BOTH your strength and skill generally favoring one stat or the other. A couple weapons scale very well with both stats such as Ludwigs Holy Blade B Strength B Skill. Upgrading your weapon will almost always improve the scaling at certain points. Some weapons may also scale with your Arcane stat however in order to benefit from that scaling you have to infuse your weapon with an element arcane fire or lightning using gemstones. However doing so will remove the strength and skill scaling.,bloodborne,cptrgw4,2,t5_31k9i

3528647,0,t1_cptq1gf,Yea Ive noticed that. I just recently ran across a rather nasty enemy or collection of enemies bundled into one nice neat package and the range for the blades really does it in. Thats really the only complaint though. The damage output is decent although slightly less than I would care for. But dat speed though. Ill gladly trade damage output for agility any day. Now range is a different story. Im not sure if Im ready to trade range for agility. Logically speaking you can have the strongest weapon in the game but if you practically have to be touching any enemy to do the damage then an enemy with a pitchfork might actually get close to killing you. Ill give em a bit longer and a chance at a different area because the one Im in now is harder than hell with the blades and then Ill see how I feel about them.

Hes weak to fire so use fire paper or molotovs. Hes also attracted to pungent blood cocktail. Use those to distract him when you need to heal eat an antidote or apply more fire paper. Hell run over the area twice before returning his attention to you.If you dont have a cocktail on you theres a statue way in the back. Run around it and heal.

Not trying to argue but I encourage anyone to try faster weapons as well as the ultra  popular kirkhammer and Ludwig . Theyre easily as viable and I much prefer them after trying both.

With amplifier you can have both audios come out of your speakers but not simultaneously. You would need to swap your input every time you want to hear audio from the other source.Through an mixer with builtin  channel sound card you could possibly get both audio out simultaneously if you route both audio sources to separate channels. ,bloodborne,cpvem9y,1,t5_31k9i

There is no grand scheme for us there is no meaning we are nothing. But we have been indoctrinated into thinking that life is precious etc and to follow along the theatre we have built to hide the real fears obscurity and death. The fact that we really know nothing but mimicry and what we have claimed as truths yet we are so fragile that it only takes the sighting of something unknown that drives us to the brink of insanity.

3551531,0,t1_cpx2lgy,Look man if you liked Bungies prior FPS mechanics see also  entire HALO series youre going to love Destiny for a good while at least.  I say that from personal experience.  What will kill it for you if anything does is that under all the beautiful art assets and polished shooter mechanics lies a soulcrushing grindfest ripped straight from the pits of the worst MMO grinds and FTP moneyholes.  Only with the FTP games they make the grind interminable hoping youll break down and pay them money to skip some time on the treadmill... but Destiny doesnt have that option and the grind is just as bad.  If youre totes cool with doing the same stupid boring repetitive thing endless amounts of times just to grind out enough Glimmer game currency to upgrade a Legendary or Exotic item only knowing youll be expected to do the exact same thing umptykazillion times again in a couple of months when the next expansion releases if youre okay with that play it and have fun.  If youre fortunate as I was youll meet awesome people from around the world who share your love of shooting aliens in the face.Im not saying its a bad game.  Its a potentially great game thats totally hamstrung by A a criminal lack of content slowly being corrected by DLC releases and B unforgivably bad decisions regarding the endgame activity treadmill.Diablo  Reaper of Souls is basically an illustrated howto in EXACTLY what any good game developer ought to be doing to keep its endgame run varied interesting engaging and fun.  Destiny takes literally no lessons from this nearly perfect model.  Its almost as if they saw it and said Lets do literally the opposite of this.  I still cant believe they did some of the stuff they did.  You might actually enjoystay with Destiny more just because some of its worst growing pains are  hopefully  behind it.  Just ask someone about the Exotic regrind whargrrbl if you want an afternoons worth of comedic reading.,bloodborne,cpx3iy2,9,t5_31k9i

JUST WAITTTT!!!!  not that i doubt that it has happened its just not the core gameplay experience its not what the overwhelming majority of time and energy during development goes to and its not what they make most balance changes for after the fact.  no disrespect towards PvP players but thats just the nature of the game,bloodborne,cpxjpz6,1,t5_31k9i

Yeah if you wanna head in and play a beatemall type of game its gonna be tedious but thats why youre given molotovs pebbles shortcuts etc...  As for Rom or freja patience IS a combat strategy and its the one you need to use for that fight. Its literally the only thing you need to use to win. Well that and the O button a lot.

You should really look up how NAT types work and seeing if this is the issue instead of blaming a game that probably has nothing to do with the problem. You most likely have a strict nat type or nat type  which only allows you to connect with others that have nat type . If you just forward your ports you should be at nat type  which allows you to connect more freely. I had the same issues cooping but after i forwarded my ports and followed the instructions posted here I connect to friends instantly  of the time.,bloodborne,cpynwop,0,t5_31k9i

3567369,0,t3_316dbr,Well OP im gonna find you a video that perfectly explains Souls PvP. This was made for Dark Souls but it somewhat applied to Bloodborne because of how PvP is handled here as well. Basically somewhere a group of PvPers in Dark Souls created an obscure set of rules when it comes to PvP. These rules were made to apply to legit v duels where you summon your opponent. From there a bunch of idiots tried to force the legit v duel rules into all forms of PvP........which is stupid. InvasionDuel. This has since created an idiotic cognitive dissonance. For example look up OroborotheNinjas youtube and watch his First Bloodborne PvP video. He mentions how bad his enemies are because they use Blood Vials then like  seconds later he uses . He also calls them bad because they are ganking host fighting with summon against invader despite that ringing the summoning bell is one of only  means by which to be invaded. This is something that has been going on since Dark Souls and I dont imagine its going to change until prominent PvPers like Oroboro stop perpetuating the idea that the rules of legit v duels apply to all aspects of PvP. I would honestly say that with the way online works in this game legit v duels will disappear because there is no system in place to allow for them. Most PvP is going to occur as invasions or coop turned invasion.,bloodborne,cpywnf3,2,t5_31k9i

Im not sure how wide the radius is that you can summon other people from  and if it matters on where you are now vs where you rang the bells. I tend to get summoned pretty quickly in some areas  was able to get summoned  or  times in a row pretty quickly at two bosses that people tend to have a hard time with.When doing coop with a friend with a password playing in the same room  sometimes the summon happens almost instantly other times it can take a few minutes.

You get one insight just for seeing a boss if you kill it you get a couple more.  So you can suicide to a boss to open the ability to level.

If you can pick up a chronological collection of all his short stories though Id recommend going for that one so you get a sense of how his universe was born and progressed through the years. He never wrote actual novels but a couple of his longest stories are basically short or even medium novels namely At the Mountains of Madness Charles Dexter Ward Call of Cthulhu and others.Its hard to go wrong with him though maybe Id leave his collaborations and his forays into ancient Egypt and such for later since theyre not always worth it.One of my favorite and less talked about stories is The Shunned House if you wanna try something at random.,bloodborne,cq0um3e,10,t5_31k9i

3588440,0,t3_31gh7s,Couple of things to keep in mindYou might be too low of a level. At lower levels a lot of Roms attack can nearly one shot you. Maybe try farming some good spots and getting your damage resistance up.His attacks are rather easy to read. Be patient. When he shoots those annoying crystals down onto you actually look up and try to dodge them that way. The rest of his moves are pretty easy to dodge.I beat him without bolt paper and very few molotovs. All I used was the threaded cane really. Just be patient circle him and wait for s solid opening in the spiders. Go in for a few hits then back out. You can kill the spiders their weakness is their back but honestly its a waste of time. You open yourself up for too many attacks from Rom himself if you try to take out all his little minions.Focus on Rom dodge the spiders look for openings and look up when he shoots the crystals. Not saying the boss is easy by any stretch of the imagination but if you do that it should be easier. Again you may also need to level up a little bit. No shame in that. ,bloodborne,cq1b63q,1,t5_31k9i

3601564,1,t3_31kvyy,Spoilers The old man in the beginning of the game who turns you into a hunter is the blood minister. The woman who asks you to leave is the real Iosefka. The girl you meet in the clinic is a member of the choir and killed the original Iosefka so she could pretend to be her to get people to come to the clinic thinking theyll be safe so she can experiment on them. The Alien being in the first room of the game when you come back later on makes a lot more sense now right? Yharnam blood Is just human blood mixed with pale blood the blood of a great one He says just look at it as a bad dream is because youre sort of in a bind. When you die the pale blood in you returns you to the dream which also lets you go from the dream to the real world. However youre trapped in the dream unless you can Transcend the hunt You know how once the blood moon starts the nightmare kind of starts to spill into the real world? The hunters dream spills into the real world also in the form of hunters being able to go to and from the dream and back. How hunters are made is theyre injected with Yharnam blood which has much more paleblood in it than the blood that the church used for blood ministration so the transformation into a beast is almost instant. Drinking paleblood makes a human see themselves for what they really are and if youre weak and give into this feeling you turn into a beast however your character overcomes this feeling this is symbolized by the werewolf being you almost giving into the feeling and then burning up as you overcome it and as a result becomes a hunter. The overcoming turning into a beast is sort of the test to become a hunter if you fail youre a beast if you pass youre a hunter. The lore of this entire game is great if you dig deep enough to find it.Edit Fixed the Iosefka part,bloodborne,cq2sy5i,1,t5_31k9i

3616221,0,t1_cq4aby7,I think people are still figuring out the level ranges. I have had a ton of PvP and CoOp going through with my th character. Im level  currently and at the Nightmaresspoiler. I have found that  for the second half of the game After Rom basicallyspoiler works really well. I kind of thought I would be under leveled and have a harder time but its been very active. It seems some people are stopping their levels around the s and early s.That being said I can go into Nightmare Frontierspoiler in NG at level  and get constant invasions for anyone curious thats a PvE character I have a  and an  for PvP. If I dont get invaded within  min after finishing an invasion or being invaded I just exit the game load back in and I get instantly invaded.Also we have found that for coop it matches a ton faster if the person is already ringing their small resonant bell when you ring your beckoning bell. So if you are using a password make sure to have your buddy ring his bell first before you try and beckon him into your game. We normally get summoned instantly or within  seconds using this method. Outside this method it would seem without a password the system is looking for people who have rung their bell before your beckoning bell to match you up. Physical location also seems to have an impact so try to stand around where you think a lot of people would be waiting to be summoned. like by the lamp a short cut or the boss door.Thats all I got.,bloodborne,cq4h4a3,3,t5_31k9i

3616672,0,t3_31qxln,Hey for someone that claims to not be good at figuring out the Lore you did a great job with this. If you havent finished the game dont read down heavy spoilers.Let me toss you a few more bones to work with.There is an item When I get home if I find it I will tell you which one it is that confirms in its description that The Choir is made up the leading scholars from Byrgenwerth.  It isnt this exact quote but it is very direct and specific about them being one in the same.This is important because of the cut scene you are referencing.Master Willem Oh I know I know. You think now to betray me.  Laurence if directly or indirectly does end up betraying Willem. How do I know this? The Healing Church over takes the College according to the lore we find. It was the healing church after all that declared the woods leading to Byrgenwerth The Forbidden Woods and made them off limits. Something could have gone bad at the college for them to have done this and Willem may have been at fault but since the Church remained in power and we have that item description saying that the heads of the church and leading scholars are one in the same I think we can say Laurence or the Healing Church at the time took over the college and muscled Willem out.This leads me into what is actually going on in the game. It would be my guess that Willem is somehow trying to fight against whatever it was that Laurence unleashed. This being the case it seems he points you in the direction to free ROM as this will lead you to the nightmares and being able to kill the newborn and eventually lead you into fighting the moon presence. What I dont know yet is why or how this is supposed to help as we end up bringing the Blood Moon once we kill ROM. This part is still fuzzy to me any thoughts are appreciated.I do want to point out one more connection. The Unseen Village appears to be lead by Mensis I think going off memory sorry if it was Mergo. I think you can find this in lore Going to try and find these when I get home for you. He was also a scholar AND a choir member. Not sure if he took over after Laurence became a beast or if he was there from the start but there is overlap between The Unseen Village and the Church. A lot of the Churches dirty laundry seems to be hidden here.So just to be clear what we have found has lead us to be able to see that the Church is really at fault here. They arent healing anyone they are slowly and methodically spreading the beast plague throughout the city. They are the source of the plague and at the point that we get there the Church are the ones most far gone from being human. Imposter Inoesfka has a Choir garb on after all and she likes turning people into Kin. She seems to be one of the eldest members of the Church left as she is actively trying to be a vessel for one of the great ones. Hence why she becomes pregnant at the blood moon and when you kill her has an umbilical cord. Pretty sure this is what she wanted.Sorry kind of a rant hope there is some helpfulinteresting stuff in here for you.,bloodborne,cq4iywg,2,t5_31k9i

Dance in front of him and if you can find the sweet spot to invoke the vomitlava sequence immediately dodge to his side and go to work on the legs with charged attack.

But I like how the beasts have personalities and characteristics. Comparing Cleric beast to something like Abhorrent beasts shows this i think. Cleric beast comes off to me as something that is suffering and not in control. Where as Abhorrent beast has refined accurate and strategic attacks.Humanoid bosses are pretty interesting though as the new player moves set allows for much more agile fights however this is nothing new to the industry but in the context of souls games this is refreshing compared to the armoured dude with a weapon bosses.,bloodborne,cq6eu5s,1,t5_31k9i

3636899,0,t1_cq6rafj,gt but its completely accepted as what Dark Souls  could have been if it were done right.By who?  I cant think of anyone that wanted Dark Souls  to have no magic schools less than  weapons a switch in setting to victorian roles changed to quicksteps a regainhealthonhit system PvP restricted to people doing coop for the most part no dueling arenas and so on.  Unless were talking of completely accepted as things you think to yourself alone.  The only thing that Bloodborne got that Dark Souls  purchasers wanted was Miyazaki at the helm.gt It is TECHNICALLY its own IP yes but it has the same controls and combat style albeit with more rollingsidestepping than previous titles with the removal of shields and armor.I mean sure Destiny is technically its own IP but really its Halo without blank.  You still have similar shooting but they added character levels classes and some other stuff.  Its still Halo though.  Thats what that argument sounds like to me.  Lords of the Fallen had more in common with Souls than Bloodborne and it was a pretty shitty ripoff.In any event even if they were the same series the mechanics dont necessarily translate.  Ive already pointed out that youre comparing a game that lets you carry  blood vials with games that let you carry hundreds of healing items literally.  There is no comparison there.Cannibalizing health to use as ammo wasnt really a thing in Souls either at least not a mainstream mechanic of the games. gtI never need to use blood bullets because gtyou had to through some VERY POOR practice to reach a point where you wasted  bullets and your opponent is still standinggtIf you dont have low vials you managed bullets poorlyThis is Argument from Leetness or the equivalent of saying I dont need to do that and if you do it you suck  I am awesome git gud scrub.Let me turn that back on you then.  If you cant kill someone before they burn up a bunch of vials healing themselves youre a shitty player.  If it takes you  minutes to kill them youre a shitty player.  Stop trying to change the meta of Bloodborne which is not a Souls game to accommodate the fact that youre a shitty player.Alternatively you could try to change the meta to be lower level and people would die faster.  It accomplishes the same thing without removing healing.You also completely ignored the fact that I pointed out One PvP Oath gives you a bonus to blood vials a no healing meta discriminates against them specifically.   There are plenty of things that use more than one bullet and most of them Arcane tools cannon also counts though.  No healing necessarily restricts these things.  You might make do with  shots someone with a tool that gets  uses or so with a  round cap is clearly not using their bullets in the same way.This does more than expect people not to heal it expects people to adhere to a meleeparryfocused gameplay.  This restricts the PvP and makes it less interesting.  Your suggestions for meta imported from a series thats only tangentially related will directly harm the variety of combat.,bloodborne,cq6u12m,2,t5_31k9i

Ive gotten far more mileage out of points in Skill across the board in terms of that particular weapons physical damage. does it not actually make a difference? Is this anyone elses experience?In any case since youre already heavy on Strength Id definitely say the Kirkhammer or the Wheel. Though some weapons have a natural element and still have physical damage on top of it  the Mercy Blades for example do physical and arcane. The weapon system in this game is kind of weird. In some ways its more streamlined and easier to understand but in others its more complicated  the elemental effects is definitely one of those places. Like if I affix an elemental gem to a weapon like Ludwigs it switches everything to that element. Does the same thing happen when I use a paper? Or is it mixing the physical attack and elemental?Very strange indeed...,bloodborne,cq6z31j,1,t5_31k9i

3645075,0,t1_cq7mfan,gtbow noobsOh boy.  Please dont do the git gud thing nonironically. The level isnt  melee friendly by any means.  The best safest most efficient easiest way of getting through it is still with long range attacks.  Go to the DS subreddit and search for threads on the Shrine of Amana.  The top rated comment in any of them and the accepted approach to the area was using your bow.Nothing in the Souls games  except killing enemies like the dragons from DeS and that one from DS  is impossible for melee.  But there are points where you dont go the melee route unless youre doing it to make a point.  The Shrine of Amana was one of those and in my opinion that means it was poorly designed.,bloodborne,cq7rk6p,1,t5_31k9i

3645764,0,t1_cq7tunr,Lol and it shows its true colors. Someones better and smarter than you? They are right and you are wrong? Insult them. Try so hard to offend them that your desperation almost makes a thread of its own about how pathetic you are.To be fair I am still stupid. I fear I cant even begin to describe what that makes you. Circlejerk...? really? Do those exist anymore or did they ever? Isnt that just something that children and men of no significance say to anything and anyone they dont like?Look it is what it is. You created a post with an issue. Then everytime someone offered sound advice which a lot of were the same and these people all reported success you still come up with why that didnt work or wont work. Youre like the girl on facebook that complains shes sick. then is offered a ride to the doctor but no cuz she cant work the seatbelt. is offered medicine but no cuz she might choke. then is offered to be comforted but no cuz she tried that nothing worked and now shes gonna kill herself. dont we wish PAfter I saw you called me honey I thought maybe you are a girl. In which case all of my above grievances are null and I revoke them all and apologize. Yet whether I care if you accept it is another story as your opinions dont matter to me.If you are a guy then . you are whining a lot and irrational illogical and bad. please return the game and stop wasting peoples time.. you said circlejerk as a direct insult. I never got good at dark souls. I am far from any circlejerk like activities involving. Im relating my friends experience with me complaining about that to you complaining about this.. Your sympathies and thoughts mean nothing here. you are a non contributing waste of skin HA.

3646508,0,t1_cq7s1p8,I have platinum on the game and I have all weapons. I have  weapons  including Blades of Mercy... And that is not dual wielding. In Dark Souls  you could use a greatsword in one hand a hammer in the other and switch to a dual wielding stance  you could use  different melee weapons at once. In BB the best we get is a weapon that splits into two daggers or the beast claws. That sucks a little bit in comparison to the DS system I actually loved to dual wield longswords katanas and greatswords. The blades of mercy moveset is fun but its just  weapon. It actually reminds me a bit of DS dual wielding  daggers. Heck there were  daggers in DS. That game was ripe with weapons.,bloodborne,cq7xgnm,1,t5_31k9i

3647397,0,t1_cq7nvqr,While I agree in principle I wouldnt say the reason Bloodborne works without a map is because its simple. Its not. The levels are way more complex and labyrinthine than most games with maps. What they are is much MUCH more tightly designed and they make use of far more sophisticated environmental cues to help guide the player through an area and even then its very possible to get lost which is fine because it fits the theme of the game. ,bloodborne,cq813vs,6,t5_31k9i

3654252,0,t3_327u5u,Now that the honeymoon phase is winding down for a lot of people the flaws of the game are starting to show. Like network issues frame rate issues during online play build variety PVP covenants are lacking long load times etc. True that these are slightly disappointing but the game is still easily a . The setting the interconnected world how the theme is so thoroughly woven through lore character design world design and gameplay just makes for a brilliant experience. When comparing this game to Dark Souls  people tend to focus on build variety and pvp covenants but they dont list what they get in Bloodborne that Dark Souls lacked. Chalice Dungeons and a game thats much more centered around fantastically tight combat. To each their own but give me Bloodbornes combat system over any other From game.Its been said before but patches and DLC will likely fix most of the flaws with Bloodborne anyway. We know a patch will be coming soon to fix load times and improve performance. Hopefully the network issues will be patched soon as well. Things like build variety will be improved with DLC. As for PVP covenants being a dev myself my guess is they just wanted to get these into the game in the most basic form that would let them expand on them later. Its a lot easier to add content to something like this if the framework already exists. So yeah Bloodborne is incredibly good and it will only get better from here.,bloodborne,cq8t75d,10,t5_31k9i

3699783,0,t3_32rbim,This isnt a comment on your ability but I think its really cool how some people have a lot of trouble on a certain boss but other can easily beat it first try and the other way around of course.Anyway when she begins to attack try to roll to her side and around her so you can get a few hits in on her back.  She doesnt have too many nonfrontal attacks.  Also as a few other comments have mentioned use fire paper.  It isnt a massive help but it does a noticeable amount of damage and that extra damage could bean the difference between a win or a loss.  Also get a few numbing mists and throw them at her throughout the fight so she cant heal.  The healing essentially gives her more health than she actually has and blocking that out effectively knocks a significant chunk out of her health.Good luck!  And I bet youll easily get some of the bosses I had a ton of trouble with.  D,bloodborne,cqe006t,1,t5_31k9i
3700000,0,t1_cqduvzp,You realize the PvP and multiplayer aspects of these games were never designed to facilitate a fair or balanced PvP environment right?  When people say that PvP in these games is people constantly finding new cheeses and ways to manipulate the meta its the truth. The most unfair setups have by far always been the most popular in every game. Scraping spear and tower shield babys nail crescent falchion spammers in DeS. Dark Magic Bead Gold Tracers Chaos Zwei in DaS. Ice rapier Santiers helixadons avelyns in DaS and now Ludwigs and cannon builds in BB. Youre playing the wrong games if your primary concern is getting pvp action. Seriously. There has almost always been something in place keeping players from being on even ground. Invaders have had a handicap of some sort since DeS.While I certainly understand the appeal of the PvPI have thousands of hours across all of these games because of it its absolutely silly to sweep all of the other amazing things that these games provide under the rug in favour of a much more shallow and supplementary multiplayer component.,bloodborne,cqe0wc1,1,t5_31k9i

This is also the source of the chord. A wet nurse is the person that helps the woman who is pregnant deliver so she has no reason to have a chord she never gave birth her self. We also know the message appears after killing mergo the baby because after killing Rom a message appears saying hunt the child to end the nightmare. Not sure the actual words.

3727543,0,t3_30lvsp,I know from my friend and personal experience that it does help in certain portions of the game.For example the tagteam hunters to the right of Cathedral Ward can be made a bit easier with it. The Rifle Spear spamming prick becomes a little less obnoxious if you use it since it makes you a lot harder to stagger with guns. My friend used it to defeat Djuras shotgun in Old Yharnam. Note I ended up just cheesing the gunner in C. Ward by running in a circle to get him to reset then backstabbing him. Laziness OP.Its not much but if you havent gotten the hang of dodging yet it can make life a little less obnoxious.It also does reduce the damage by SOME if not a lot.Also fair to note that when youve run completely out of stamina you cant dodge or sprint for a short time till it reaches ? so I guess as a very last resort.,bloodborne,cqh5y1p,2,t5_31k9i

3728710,0,t1_cqh9e35,Does Gehrman want to wake up from the dream? Or does he simply wish to release you from his dream? Who is the real host of the dream is it you or him? If its you youre right that offing you would free him from the Dream and Nightmare too.spoiler However theres much language adrift that seems to suggest otherwise of the dream being a captor of you rather than of Gehrman. I think were mostly on the same page sort of but coming at it from different angles. I dont think its necessary for the Dreamscape to be real for you to physically manifest in it but on the flipside of that I dont think its necessary if the Dreamscapes are real for you to physically manifest in them to Awaken and as you rightly think die. For the purposes of the game I think we do physically manifest in them as you think but I think Micolash and Djura are great examples that you could project yourself into these places just as well and awaken from them without death although probably not as much with Micolash. However this says nothing of the reality of them all it says is that you can appear in them in such a way as to be hazardous to yourself. Similarly you can draw things out of them in such a way as to empower yourself or bring yourself harm of which the people of Yharnam appear to have done both.Personally in writing this Ive come to be fond of the idea that these are real places in another plane of being where people are projecting themselves but in the process distorting them through the stresses it puts on the mind to project into such a different reality. It also probably doesnt help that the Great Ones may be contributing to these places distortionstress on the visitors minds. I suspect that the scholars of Byrgenwerth dreamt the Lecture Hall into being though as a central point to move out into the rest of the Dreamscape which would explain the Nightmare Frontier and Nightmare of Mensisspoiler being accessible from there. In itself the more structured nature of the Nightmare of Mensisspoiler suggests the possibility of an attempt to colonize the Nightmare albeit Amygdalas Chamberspoiler does seem to indicate the possibility that may not be the case.Sorry for the longwinded comment. This is a really neat part of the game to me. ,bloodborne,cqhaq43,1,t5_31k9i

I think of these games as being a bit like driving games. The tracks are initially challenging and getting the hang of some of them can feel almost impossible at first. After a while and with a bit of practice you can swing you favourite car through the even most challenging chicanes with the ease of someone who knows what theyre doing.

3739081,0,t3_338dj1,I have a nice little route I take which is pretty good for avoiding him and getting to the bottom of his tower. When you head across the first bridge and turn right down the steps to the immediate left is a broken balcony you can drop down from. Drop down from here and head into the door which is now behind you and kill the beast in the room. You should now be in the room next to the one with all the barrells on the ground and two beasts lurking around the trick here is the entice the beasts into your room one at a time if possible. Fighting them amongst the barrels where he shoots you is near impossible.Once you have dealt with these sprint across the little bridge and into the next room. As you head through the door do an immediate uturn to the left and you will find two hidden beasts who can be ganked quickly before they get to their feet. Then as you move across the room another big beast will burst out the door and attack you. Kill it.Outside of the room there are quite a few beasts but you can entice them in small numbers into the room and take them out one or two at a time. He can still shoot at you in the area outside this room but the spots he can hit you are quite small and its easy to roll out of his gunfire here. If you head down the ramp from this area you will be at the bottom of his ladders or you can move on into the beast summoning room where there is a handy shortcut at the end.Hope this helps.

3741325,0,t1_cqiltsv,gt I fear a little for its replayabilityThis is my only concern with Bloodborne. While it has been a fantastic experience there are a couple of reasons that I may not be playing multiple characters. First of all it doesnt feel like there are as many possible builds available. Faith Intelligence Hex and Pyromancy builds dont exist. A handful of arcane items pale in comparison to the casting possibilities in earlier games. There are few enough weapons that making a pure strength or skill character means limiting my playthrough to one or two weapons. Perhaps Ill do a Waste of Skin run though.The second point is more basic theres no way Im grinding through all the chalice dungeons with multiple characters. Dont get me wrong I love the high level dungeons. Great stuff. But the grind for materials and unlocking all  chalices again doesnt appeal to me especially when Im not convinced that alternate characters would provide a genuinely different experience anyway.,bloodborne,cqiqhrc,22,t5_31k9i

3741776,0,t3_339ju7,Ooo man I just beat this thing last night.I was using Ludwigs  all the physical ATK gems I could muster but Burial Blade  should work just as well.First note that the Watchdog always uses the charge attack first. Make sure youre constantly strafing around it right from the start. You should dodge the charge easily and then it will be pressed up against the wall. Immediately get in there and use a charged R. If you stagger it risk two Rs or an L and get the hell away because it recovers from stagger with an AoE.After this stay midrange and constantly circle it. The best time to attack is a moment after it does a head sweep it swerves its head one side opens its mouth then chomps down sweeping to the other side where you should quickstep forward and R but be sure to dodge back after you swing because it can chain head sweep attacks back and forth. I found the other attacks too risky to punish. Staying midrange also lets you backstep when it uses a fiery pawswipe so you dont get hit by the flashy fire.The other highly punishable move is the lava spit. When you see it stop tracking you and its throat start to bulge rush in next to its side and charge an R at its belly. If you get the stagger risk another L or R and dodge back to avoid the AoE. Otherwise just dodge back after landing the charge attack.This boss of all the bosses I felt the most important thing is dont get greedy. If you miss its okay. Dodge back and stay safe dont try to attack again and wait for your next opportunity.,bloodborne,cqiscbe,1,t5_31k9i

3762057,0,t1_cql21cq,gt I mean come on... Kane Hearst?Its definitely a clever interpretation and not a connection I would have made. That doesnt mean its wrong of course just that Im skeptical PI think part of my reluctance to embrace it stems from Citizen Kane feeling a bit out of place as a source of inspiration at least when measured against the games other more explicit influences. For instance Miyazaki toured eastern Europe for architectural inspiration and the Lovecraftianness of BB barely needs mention. Citizen Kane in this context somehow feels foreign to me.Moreover I dont think the Annalise  Charles Foster Kane comparison really meshes. To my mind its inaccurate to view CFK as an aristocrat. The trappings of wealth are not in and of themselves aristocratic. CFK was an industrialist and a self made bootstrapped man to boot. Thats almost the antithesis of aristocratic.Perhaps more importantly what are arguably the central character themes of Citizen Kane are not particularly well reflected in AnnaHurst. Regret. Love lost. Innocence lost. I didnt really get the sense Annalise shared any of these sentiments. ,bloodborne,cql3pc5,6,t5_31k9i

3763391,0,t1_cql8tvm, Use the regain system more instead of blood vials. Consumables seriously arent a problem. I like farming silverbeast in the loran chalice. Its about a  minute thing and he gives off about k echos. Vials cost k a piece. IMO thats not a bad farm at all. The only place you will be hurting for vials in is early game and thats where enemies drop them. I think this is going to be a lot less of a thing to complain about once the loading screens get patched this month. The fact is games like this dont see a whole lot of variety. Its not the games fault its just that people tend to flock to the most powerful weapon. I use hunters armor for just running around its got really good p.def. I use keeper armor for lightningfire res and I use either Tomb Prospectors or the white church robes for Arcane def. If you find the game too easy not one of your complaints then you just dont have to worry about this I guess.

3784429,1,t1_cqnnfo9,Thats mostly true but its also not that simple. For example Dark Souls II has better latency handling on hits than in Bloodborne. Ive tested this with video proof and if you still dont believe that compare parry timings from Dark Souls II to Dark Souls I or Bloodborne. You can parry enemies in II almost as if they are PVE enemies and in Dark Souls I and Bloodborne you have to parry way before they even strike. I know everyones panties get in a bunch when you say something good about Dark Souls II here but you cant ignore evidence.,bloodborne,cqnnk6u,5,t5_31k9i
3785032,1,t3_33qkl3,TLDR at the bottom.Bloodborne PvP is broken at the core.Bear with me here.Throughout its PvP history Dark Souls  had a problem with stagnant overdefensive play.You know about DWGR spear turtles picture an everpoking spear retreating at Road Runneresque speed forever. and roll backstabs right? They dominated the game sure.But the ultimate expression of them was how a DWGR reverse roll could roll backstab any attack in the game and was absolutely riskfree because you could just spam roll again if it failed. You didnt have to meaningfully predict the enemy just anticipate that they were going to do SOMETHING.If you were right you backstabbed them.Wrong? No biggie it was zero risk for a big reward keep rollin.So whoever got bored first... Lost.Highest level play was basically  minutes of rolling and occasional poking.You might see where this is going.Remind me what do guns in BB do? Well they parry. If they predict you and parry you you might get oneshotted.But hey its a riskreward thing.If they fail their prediction of your exact method of attack and fail the parry theyre punished with... Staggering you out of any attack and dealing chip damage to you. Or  damage if youre a BT build.Which is enough damage to kill a Hunter twice over with  bullets.But if they miss? They... Well... Get away scottfree. Theyre completely unpunishable.Youd think this is balanced by only having  bullets but thats where ultraspammable dodges come in. Youre going to spam dodges so you dont get chipped and theyre going to spam dodges so you dont hit them when they dont expect to be hit so theres no pressure to use their ammo up quickly.When they think youre going to push a button other than circle they fire! ... That may take a while.You know what happens then. You rinse lather and repeat twenty frickin times.Its essentially DWGR reverse roll BS in minature. It punishes everything with impunity so the only winning move is not to play and whoever gets bored first and actually wants to play the game shock! horror! is the loser. TLDR guns punish everything with impunity spammable rolls ensure theres no pressure to use up your ammo and get down to fighting in a timely fashion ergo dodge for  minutes fire gun occasionally first one to get bored loses. No reason to swing a weapon.Edited for TLDR. ,bloodborne,cqnq1k7,-3,t5_31k9i

Fighting them gives a multitude of advantages  item drops echoes for levelupsweapon upgradesother purchases and most importantly experience.If you run past the mobs the only thing you get...is experience at running past mobs. Im a souls veteran and I was stuck in Central Yharnam for at least five hours. I rarely sprint past enemies and as a result I know their attack patterns have more currency etc.Persevere approach combat with a plan focus on isolating enemies and learn their attack patterns. A hugely useful tactic is to only attack after an enemy attacks you without getting hit of course. Bait out their attacks dodge away and then hit them during their cooldown period just be wary of combos and flurry attacks.  More aggressive approaches to combat can be taken later after you get into the game. ,bloodborne,cqotypq,2,t5_31k9i

Maybe if there was something like a Chalice Dungeon but above ground where you couldhad to hunt uninfected Humans... but each time you hurt an innocent person you got more risk of invasion from HoH or Executioners or both or some other Covenant focused solely on exterminating beasts gone mad.,bloodborne,cqub2zd,7,t5_31k9i

3843222,0,t1_cqu8qma,Uh everything that exists in this game exists solely for either gameplay purposes or symbolismor both.   The fact that its period blood well...think about it historically women have been quarantined during their periods cultures have made them feel infected and dangerous for it its present in cultures across the world in strikingly similar ways. Yet the player character consumes it to get stronger and heal and we depend on its absence to come into this very world.  You want to talk about heavyhanded this and that and how this symbol ties into that symbol thats coolbut if you view this as an archetype in a web of archetypes there are PLENTY of parallels to be made.   Did you know the silent guardian in the ward is blind? And that most beasts cover their eyes? And Willem went blind in exchange for what he called eyes lining his mind? Are you aware that the Tomb of Oedon is nearby? That Oedipus blinded himself? That Freud cast blindness as a simple for emasculation and tied the fear of blindness to the fear of being unmanly?  You act as if the acknowledgment that Ariannas blood vial is menstrual in nature is meaningless in and of itself correct? And heavyhanded? I completely disagree. It ties in with MANY themes within walking distance of the chair she sits in. Moreover theres nothing heavyhanded about referencing something that is inextricably linked with the potential for birth probably the central theme of the game considering the Old Ones alone.  Symbolism is the point. If you find symbolism for symbolisms sake uninteresting then why even discuss the plot? The reason writers use symbols is to make connections to OTHER symbols and share information in the traditional nature of storytelling.,bloodborne,cqud0dz,1,t5_31k9i

3866913,0,t3_34pwqq,DUDE listen. I went to NG before I even started the Chalice Dungeons and doing so I missed some content CRUCIAL for obtaining the Platinum. Remember to pick up the Red Jelly I think from the Lecture Buildings st floor to the right of the exit. Also in Nightmare of Mensis drop Mother Brain drop down to its location and pick up all the Great Ones Wisdom and the Blood Rock the only item in the main quest that allows you to upgrade weapons to . Next go back to the place with all the pitfalls and the little dwarves with pots in their heads and there should be a new elevator. Ride it down to a pitch black room and find Mother Brain. It wont attack you. Stand in front of it and do the Make Contact gesture in front of it for  seconds youll get a Moon Rune. Then kill it and youll get the Living String item that you need to make the final Chalice dungeon where you fight the secret final boss that gives you a Gold Trophy. I completely missed some of this stuff and had to fight through NG all the way to the Nightmare of Mensis to get it. Still the Platinum was worth it. Good luck!,bloodborne,cqx28jb,2,t5_31k9i

Hmm is it possible that if I enter this room with glowing red spiders that I might find the bell maiden on the slight middle tier of this three tier room? Wow what a lucky guess!! ... Oh my I just lowered myself into a dark dank sewerlike area where there is muck on the ground piles of rotting corpses and exposed treeroots overhead in a bunch of tight tunnels. Oh no and there are giant rats down here! How could this be?! I shouldve known!! ... Hmm Ive just entered an eerily familiar dark giant hall that is the shape of a rectangle and looks to be four stories tall. Oh what a surprise to see the closed boss door directly in front of me on the other side of the hall! And whats this I see in the center of the hall but  monsters walking aimlessly in and around a couple of wooden carts that someone mustve misplaced here whilst on their way to the market. Oh but where do I go in this room?? Hmm Im going to hope there will either be a ladder at the other end of the hall that leads to a small second story platform and another door or possibly a doorway on the ground floor in the middle of the room which could lead to one of the aforementioned sewers or maybe even the ladder AND an entrance to the sewers!!! ... Hey wait a second these rooms are starting to look very familiar. Oh come on who am I kidding? This room has to be different because occasionally a flash of electricity shoots three meters up the side of the room. ... And this room looks kinda like one Ive seen before but it cant be because this room has dust that swirls around my feet. ... Huh this boss seems familiar to me as though I fought him  other times in the game. But I know he cant be the same because the other similar bosses were all found in different dungeons with completely unpronouncable consonantladen names!

It has amazing singletarget DPS but is lacking when it comes to dealing with crowds.The threaded cane was my weapon of choice on my first character through NG and NG. It has ridiculous range in trick form that makes up for any slowness. You can annihilate groups of enemies without them getting close to you and its great for a lot of bosses i.e. Abhorrent beast bloodletting beast etc..Ive also dabbled a bit with the reiterpalasch. Its a lot of fun and I could see myself investing more in it. It doesnt have the damage of the BoM or the crowd control of the cane but it sits somewhat inbetween them.As for health and stamina I have my VITEND at .

There seems to be multiple tiers of Great One but they all share this blood type. The Wet Nurse the Amygdalae the Presence the Menis Brain and I suspect the Messengers as well.Kin blood is almost clear. These were once mortals who have ascended or were transformed somehow to Kinship of the Cosmos. They arent true Great Ones they can come close but vary greatly in power. Ebrietas Rom Willem the Mindsuckers the Celestials and their emissary are all examples of Kin. The th and last one is unique to only the Doll. Her blood is pure white. What does this mean exactly?

3931287,0,t3_35gsy5,Yeah you have a point with defiled not really fitting into the games theme of fast aggressive combat.Not everyone is the ultimate badass and can avoid all hits for the whole fight even if some people act like its super easy to do so and anyone can do it if they try just because they can.Id assume most players take hits at least occasionally in almost every situation and putting you into a defiled scenario where you get oneshot unless youre way overleveled is a bit lame.Dont get me wrong I think its OK for it to be in the game but it shouldnt be part of the story chalice dungeon route imo. Should be completely optional for those seeking the extra challenge.I feel sorry for the people who want to complete the chalice dungeon route but usually need help for bosses... summoning in defiled really is ridiculous and should be changed.I also wish you only had to unlock chalice dungeons once per account that would be sweet.So after going through them once on your next character you could join any chalice glyph you previously unlocked.... the grind is real right now if you want to get multiple characters in late chalice dungeons.

And as an invader it can really get weird too when there are a lot of enemies.

3947179,0,t3_35n5dg,Reiterpallash is a great weapon to use for skill. It achieves an A scaling in Skill at  and has a quick moveset in both forms. Unlike other weapons that deal physical and blood damage Reiterpallash can actually be buffed so thats extra damage on the side. Overall it deals very strong damage in a skill build.Its bullets are also notable for being potentially very strong even with littletono levels in bloodtinge. Its blood damage is what the bullets are based on so at  it will deal base damage comparable to another fullyleveled gun. However because  physical damage  gems also affect blood damage your bullet damage will be much higher with a Reiterpallash gemmed with strong gems than it would be with any other gun at low bloodtinge. You cannot use bone marrow ash with the Reiterpallash as it is a mainhand weapon but the extra fireboltarcane damage added from buffing your weapon also applies to the bullets so you will get extra damage on gunshots if you buff your weapon as well.Sadly the Reiterpallash is a truly awful weapon to use with arcane due to a bug. Reiterpallash displays a B scaling with arcane at  but due to how the game sees split damage adding elemental gems will actually do nothing instead of converting physical damage to elemental damage. This is because you are not supposed to be able to change splitdamage weapons to another element and the game reads physical and blood damage as split damage even though the physical damage is being done by attacks and the blood damage is being done by gunshots. Because of this until they fix this problem Reiterpallash is actually a very bad weapon to use with arcane. Overall though it is a very strong weapon and one of my favorites. It is perfectly viable in a pureskill build as just a rapier or a dagger but if you want to use its gun form to deal damage as well then you will want to put some points into bloodtinge. Nevertheless no matter how you use it it is a very strong weapon. ,bloodborne,cr67o1q,1,t5_31k9i

If any of these were tactics either you or your opponent employed in these games there was always ways of punishing them if you were skilled enough and there was always plenty of depth beyond that. The majority of DS PvP I got for a while was replete with Monastery Scimitars Chaos Blades Ice Rapiers Mastodon Greatswords and Sun Swords.

4031816,0,t3_36fr8v,Perhaps they start appearing after the death of BSB because they come from the chalice dungeons? By using the chalice looted from the BSB church building this somehow opens the dungeons and allows the snatchers to leave.I believe the three Yahargul hunters to be the last members of Mensis who remain alive the snatchers being pthumerians who came from the dungeons to complete the Mensis ritual and bring the One Reborn into our world..I wrote the following down on another thread concerning Yahargul and the origin of the snatchersMy theory they are Pthumerians who are kidnapping people from Yharnam city in order to build a physical vessel for Mergo to return to our world. the one rebornAs I see it the School of Mensis beckoned Mergo and they all got their brains fried and their consciousness trapped in the Nightmare of Mensis. Mergo the nightmare newborn and also child of Queen Yharnam of Pthumeru instructs the pthumerian survivors in the chalice dungeons to abduct people from Yharnam city so they can build Mergo a new body from their sacrificed corpses.This is just my own backstory feel free to disagree. But as I see it the Great Ones as beings far above our meagre understanding have really funky ways of producing offspring. You must understand that the Great Ones are either immortal or very very very hard to kill in fact impossible to be harmed by a normal human. Those times ingame that you beat Great One bosses is just that you defeat them not kill them. They simply retreat to a dimensional plane different from ours. This might explain why we meet Ebrietas Amygdala and Rom again in the chalice dungeons.This also happened with Mergo as he was born his body died in our human world but his presence fled to a nightmare realm. I am even tempted to think that the line Every Great One loses its child on the umbilical cords is in reference to the fact that every infant Great One dies or better their physical body in our world has to die or perhaps simply cannot hold the consciousness of a great one before it can become an adult.I dont know this for certain cause I havent gotten that far in the chalice dungeons but isnt Queen Yharnam pregnant again when you meet her in the Ihyll dungeon? Perhaps after defeating Mergos Wet Nurse the presence of Mergo fled back to a familiar place...,bloodborne,crfuwgo,2,t5_31k9i

4046819,0,t1_crhk2s9,It mirrors Laurences note that indicates Willem was right when he said that evolution without courage will doom humanity sacrifices have to be made chances need to be taken. This is also the way religions work introduce something fundamentally human as sinful or in need of some sort of holy mediation bind it to something physical or metaphysical that can provide respite use it as leverage to gain power and influence. In this case its literal the Healing Church introduced a disease only so it could peddle the cure as a widespread method of experimentation.    The word courage in that note always got under my skin because the courage it seems to be indicating is not the heroic type but rather the mentality that its all for the greater good. Depending on your reading of the Antidote as well one can interpret it to be saying that the poison itself served as the root cause for rampant blood ministrationthe only cure availableor its introduction to the general populace precipitated blood ministrations ubiquity in Yharnam. ,bloodborne,crhkgxy,15,t5_31k9i

I get it down to  health left and it always grabs me and instant kills me.  Mergos Wet Nurse. The clone is what always fucks me up. Darkbeast Paarl. Fuck this guy but hes a pushover after Rom.  Rom. Just like the blood starved beast I always get killed when Rom is at like  health. It drives me nuts.  Cleric Beast.  Vicar Amelia. Shes one of those bosses that completely demolishes me the first few times but then I beat her instantly the next day. Shadows of Yharnam. The giant snakes are probably the most difficult part. It was pretty easy though with parries.   Amygdala. Somewhat easy boss. Very predictable.  Father G. Parries all day.  One Reborn. Hitting its  legs and dodging the fireballs is pretty much all you need to do. Its a long but easy fight. Martyr Logarius. I beat him on my second try. He was annoying at first but once I figured out his moves I just parried over and over.  Gherman. Beat him on my first try. Moon Presence. Beat it on my first try too. Right after Gherman too so I had like  blood vials left. It was a pretty easy boss.  Micolash Cage. Beat him on my second try. Once you figure out what he does hes a complete push over. Wait for his squidarm attack dodge to the right get one or two hits in and repeat for both phases of the fight. Witches. Beat them on NG and NG on my first try. At least Gherman and the Moon Presence was a challenge. These two were super easy. I didnt even get hit by their demons.  Celestial Emissary. I killed this boss in like  minutes. I thought there would be a second phase to it but nope. It got me really confident for Ebrietas though which was a fucking mistake because fuck Ebrietas.

I would assume the nightmare existed already and the ritual in YaharGulspelling? was the school of mensis way of trying to access it. Everything else that happened in the unseen village including the One Reborn was just an unwanted by product?

4083147,0,t1_crlduhg,Its SAFE to say the doll is dressed in whatever was the latest fashion at the time? This made me lol a little this is more of a leap and bigger assumption than anything the OP said. The lore is admittedly based on HP Lovecraft and one of his main underlying themes is that there are certain things beyond human comprehension that when confronted will drive people insane. Its not a leap at all to say that we dont fully understand the Winter Lanterns and what they represent. I tend to agree they are probably hostile but theyre origins and relation to the lore is very speculative. Theres no question they are misunderstood to some degree.Also you somehow reach a definite conclusion based on your own theories that the Doll is not a great one. This is very debatable and its the reason there are tons of people debating it as we speak. Its by no means obvious the Doll isnt a great one the OP offered plenty of evidence that you just brush off for your own theories.Trying to apply Occams Razor to an HP Lovercraft inspired lore makes absolutely no sense.. not to mention the fact that there are no obvious conclusions about most of this stuff.,bloodborne,crlpd75,0,t5_31k9i

4111812,0,t3_37px8a,Ill add my two cents equip your best bloodtingedefence armour probably the knight gear from Cainhurst equip the wooden shield in your off hand equip numbing mist on your hot bar Lure him to the stairs  not to cheese him but because this is where you will have a chance  be patient be stingyFirst lead him around down the stairs and figure out where you need to be in order to make him backoff. Thats your safe zone. I remember that my biggest problem with him wasnt his difficulty or how hard he hit  but the fact that he would finish me off often with the gun when I needed to backpeddle and heal. That is the most frustrating thing for me. The fix is to swap out to the shield anytime you need to heal use it to block his bullets especially the chikage still hurts through it while you backup down the stairs and give yourself an opportunity to healAdditionally I would just keep the shield out unless Im planning to try a parry so that you can block the bullets when need be.Extra points if you can visceral him into a corner into one of the little alcoves along the stairs let your stamina recharge and wail on him while hes stuck there. You should be able to stagger him with every hit  its just that he usually dodges away really quick. Unload until you have one sliver of stamina left then get the fuck out and reset.  I think he only heals once heard someone say that before but even if thats true its really discouraging.

It wasnt until many many tries later exploration and some discussion with a mate who also played the game that I understood that running by enemies is an entirely valid option and that there was a hidden path near the fountain that would ultimately lead to opening the left gate and creating a shortcut to the boss that allows you to skip those werewolves.I can definitely see how someone with less patienceexploration skills could quit here if they wouldnt be in the know.,bloodborne,crv9sq2,3,t5_31k9i

4190625,0,t3_38ueez,gt. Am I only meant to increase  stats e.g. STR END VIT?many builds will primarily focus all their points outside of ENDVIT into just one primary damage stat such as strength but there are plenty that spread things out a bit more as well.  the best example of the latter is called a quality build where you focus your levels outside ENDVIT into strength and skill evenly.  quality builds are quite strong in bloodbornegtDoes levelling STR over SKL mean I will only use two handed weapons? I use Kirkhammer the term two handed weapon is a little ambiguous in bloodborne.  do you mean weapons that when transformed get an L combo instead of being able to use the sidearm at the same time?  or do you just mean the giant smashing weapons typical of strength builds in the souls games? anyway I think the answer to your question as best I understand it is no.  the saw cleaver and tonitrus are examples of weapons that work well in a strength build but arent of the giant twohanded smashing varietygt. I really like the look of arcane stuff should I put some points into ARC or would my stats be too broad then and not focused enough on one thing.for arcane you should probably invest no levels go to  and stop or just go full arcane to  its a little late for that though maybe on your next character!.  level  is a good arcane level because it doesnt require too many levels but unlocks a few of the useful hunter tools such as the phantasm shell hunters bone and beast roar.  anything more than  on a build that isnt intended to eventually hit  arcane gets into that awkward area where youve invested all these levels to get the burst damage tools and yet they wont do much damage because you havent fully invested into arcane.,bloodborne,crxximf,3,t5_31k9i

4193613,0,t3_38vxdx,I would probably go farm a little and start raising your VIT END and SKLSTR up above the rest as youll need it. Also try to focus on one weapon to bring up to  and use that as your main until you get to the end of the game. Bell maidens are a pain but at that point in the game theyre fairly easy to kill. The bigger issue are the enemies at on the streets towards the boss. If you dont have enough VIT they can easily one shot you and the boss itself isnt a pushover. VIT is probably the most important thing. I would suggest getting it to at least  before you attempt the boss but thats just me. VIT and END can sit at  until the end of the game and from there you can just do chalice dungeons before NG to level up more.As for STRSKL they both have a soft cap at  so leveling it past that will give you diminishing returns but its still okay to level it past that. You dont really want to take it past  though because at that point youd be wasting your level ups but that wont be an issue for right now.If you havent noticed enemies with the red veinsstreakslines on them are the ones that will come back to liferespawn via bell maidens.

4207264,0,t1_crzssyu,Endurance is fine people seem to think its a waste since you can boost it with runes. I think high end is useful for huge stamina intensive combos it can really increase your burst damage. You have to let your massive stamina bar fully recover to reap the benefits. Also stamina runes give you a larger boost if your endurance is already high. Its an underrated stat that is especially useful with stamina intensive weapons. If youre using a threaded cane for example endurance might not be a focus for you since it uses so little stamina.Also hes saying skill is generally favored over str for weapons that scale with both equally since visceral damage scales with skill making it more valuable than str in these cases,bloodborne,crztedv,1,t5_31k9i

Crow hunters are something i would like to see more of but it doesnt warrant an entire sequel. Maybe itll be in the dlc?Really though all of that is my interpretation! Part of the beauty of the souls games is the way that these stories are told with gaps intentionally left out leaving us to interpretate and speculate for months.

4246337,0,t3_39l4tk,If you value some input from someone who has not played the Souls games I can give you my advice. It does sound a bit like the descriptions in your post seem to be mainly criticising BB combat for not being the same as the Souls games.It is a very quick game the combat is explosive rather than strategic it does rely on dodging and being aggressive and playing to a quick rhythm. Youre not meant to watch the boss wind up and react accordingly youre meant to take the fight to the boss and try and control what sort of attacks they do. Learn the situations and bait them into acting a certain way.Combat is definitely not just spamming dodge. While the weapons are limited in number they are very varied in style and you can change your approach midfight without even switching your weapon. Dodging is important but its also a sure fire way to get yourself killed if overused. In fact one of its best uses is to dodge into an enemy to get in its face. In short while I cant say whether you will like it or not I dont think the reasons you have given in the OP are necessarily valid.,bloodborne,cs49ub3,2,t5_31k9i

Now bloodborne was freaking excellent but dark souls  was not in my opinion. It was still a very good game but I think most agree that it was the weakest in the series. I just dont want this great series to go the way of games like assassins creed where they crap out games as fast as possible where profit is all that matters and if the game also happens to be good well thats a bonus. Im not saying gaps like the GTA series has in between releases but maybe just a bit more time in between games could be a good thing. Build up hype let the devs have some time to think up some really new interesting ideas. Now dark souls  could come out amp totally blow everyone away which would be awesome but I dont want it to go down the path that weve seen other series go down. Dark souls is now a big namemoney maker and sometimes publishers dont know when to ease off the gas a bit. Thats my  cents.,bloodborne,cs4t8i7,2,t5_31k9i

You might be forced to go back depending on how many vials you have left but this will save you the consumtion of another insight to summon for help and you can get to the Small Resonant Bell a bit earlier.

Big skeletons near the large divine ember for example are difficult to see aggro on you all at once and are in a pit you cant get out of without killing them first. Titanite demons are not even close to being cheap. Bed of Gravity is an example of cheap design as well. It is very weird youd use titanite demons as an example considering that they Dont respawn except for Izalith are completely optional are fought in large areas even in Izalith since the walkway is quite long and no additional mobs are fought while dealing with them. There are cheap enemies and areas no doubt titanite demons are a poor choice to make your point though.,bloodborne,cs9mjwh,1,t5_31k9i

4312774,0,t3_3adc5d,As uOIP said go for her head whenever she gives you an opening for the first half of the fight. I find the best way to bait her head slam not flying is to keep running in close and then backing away quickly to just out of tentacle range.Once you hit her in the head enough times shell stagger and you can visceral attack her. The best way to stagger her is with charged attack if you can get away with them but regular attacks will get her there eventually. Hopefully your visceral gets her down to below half health then shes going to do her charge up move with the shrieking sound. My first instinct was to get away from her when she was doing that but you actually want to get right up in her face and charge attack her and then just smash at her for as long as you can get away with. Ludwigs in its transformed state is perfect for this with the charge attack and the R follow up then you just L her head as much as you can until she starts attacking again.Doing that you should be able to get her down to just a couple of hits left before shes in her last phase and starts doing the flying slam.  At that point just stay really close to her and hit her as often as possible until shes down.Using bolt paper the whole time makes this much faster and you definitely want to have it on when shes charging up after you visceral attack her. I was stuck on her in NG for a very long time until I got in her face while she was charging up killed her my first time doing that.,bloodborne,csbrxvq,1,t5_31k9i

4349655,0,t3_3atzid,The executioners I cant be of much assistance on cause Im not great at fighting them but the kidnappers arent as hard as they might seem at first.You want to bait them into a punch attack or the attack where they try to hit you with the bag these attacks have a very large backswing a time in which the enemy is recovering from his attack and cant attack again.  Avoid that with a dodge and get a couple of attacks in hopefully it will do enough damage that he will begin to use his power up He just stands for a second clenching his fists and then poofs red if not try to bait the same attacks again this power up takes a while so run behind him and use your weapons charge attack hold R to cause a backstab which will hopefully kill him. If it doesnt follow his body and attack while hes standing back up. The main part is you have to backstab him when hes powering up because they become monsters when theyre powered up. Really fast and really strong so if it seems risky to run around him because he already started the animation do it anyway if you die then oh well not much to do about it because you likely wouldnt survive the powered up version.This game has a lot of emphasis on learning movesets of the enemies and being able to figure out which moves give you openings to land attacks. Shields in the DkS games allowed you to forgo this and create your own openings by blocking which would stagger the enemy. Without having a shield to compensate for the lack of moveset knowledge it becomes almost vital to your progression. Whenever you have trouble with an enemy make sure you pay a lot of attention to the moves they use most enemies have unique windups for almost every attack. Use these windups to decide wherewhen you should dodge and try to decide beforehand if youll be able to land a hit or two after the swing. If you dont know the windup or you arent sure if youll have time to attack back off and remember what he did for the next time.,bloodborne,csfxsdf,2,t5_31k9i

Both Oedon and his inadvertent worshippers surreptitiously seek the precious blood. Its saying the Oedon lacks form and exists only in voice and also that blood is the essence of Oedon himself. Dont know what that means but I think we can both agree that the Moon Presence does have a form. And for the Moon Presence it doesnt want to kill all the hunters. Gherman is the one who does that he gets to free them from the dream after they have completed the hunt. The Moon Presence comes to us because we have killed Gherman and a hunter must always be present in the dream as a caretaker and guide for other hunters.

At least when you do it at higher levels you can probably take a couple of hits.I knew Loran Darkbeast would be a nightmare and couldnt stomach it directly after Abhorrent Beast so did Isz and some main game bosses then came back and died  times.

4562548,0,t3_3diilk,This is so appropriate for me on new game and Darkbeast Paarl seems literally impossible. During my regular game he was pretty easy get under him knock him down swing to death no problem. Now in new game plus he does his aoe every time I get under him immediately.  His swipes seem more effective making it harder to get under him and when he doesnt use his aoe he moves or hops away quickly so its very difficult to get under him and do a charge R with anything. Not sure if its purely because of new game or if they recently super charged him during a patch but holy shit hes way op Im considering playing the rest of the game and just leveling as much as I can and leave him for last.,bloodborne,ct5q43h,1,t5_31k9i
4564342,0,t3_3djb3u,Hahaha some people were complaining about the blacksuited humanlike beasts killing them shit the mob of red spiders I hate most.No man k is noting.  The best place to get echoes is inside the dungeons.  You are in NG already so you mustve done the dungeons or you should start immediately.So try to get to Ailing Loran just killing the mob of hooded beasts at the Layer  without any damage to you you get K per run.  No need to kill the boss.  If you equipped multiple Moon runes two or more you could get K per run.Now march on to Lower Loran at Level  each run you will net K plus nice bloodstone chunks by killing the so ridiculously easy boss.  This is where I farmed echos and chunks with a small or no scratch.  So easy to level up your character to  each level would cost gtK and upgrade the weapons with chunks.  After this point on echoes are useless as you can max out all the storage to hold your consumable items.  This is when you buy  handlanterns.,bloodborne,ct5y7sx,2,t5_31k9i

4669537,0,t3_3ew86q,The combat is by far the most stand out thing in the game. Every time I put the game down I wanted to play more and I have made multiple characters and played through the game around  or so times now because I just want to play more of it. Its very rare I find a game where the gameplay alone is that enjoyable.BB also has a fantastic atmosphere and world in general. I like Dark Souls but I am far more interested in the gothic world of BB than the fantasy of the Souls games.As for the story itself and why you should care about saving it you are a hunter. Thats your role. You are a scary manwomen who walks the dangerous streets at night killing anything that moves. Nothing more needs to be said at the start of the game the story progression from then on is entirely from the perspective of an outsider who has come to Yharnam. The story is told visually without the use of long dialogue with NPCs or lots of cutscenes. Its just a different take on storytelling.Games are best experienced first hand. You cant get a sense of the combat if you arent the one fighting and you cant get a sense of he atmosphere if you arent controlling the pace of the game and the character itself.I will say if you do play this game do not be discouraged by the obnoxious press surrounding the Souls games. There are some rather vocal fans especially in games media who obsessed over the idea that these games are hard and that dying is a huge part of the game. Lines like the Dark Souls of X when comparing any game that is remotely challenging or has any loss when dying springs to mind. Its really not about that. You learn the rules of the game quickly and at times when you die you know exactly why you did. Luckily this attitude has died out a lot as more and more play these games. The games are about interesting encounters you overcome its not about screwing over the player at every turn just for laughs from the game devs.,bloodborne,ctj5c1m,1,t5_31k9i

4681261,0,t1_ctjsntc,Well right but its still true that Dark Souls was designed to be played with a shield and while you can play without one or one on your back its a gimped way of playing.  Its fun though I did it myself.     What I was trying to describe in my OP is that it would be cool to see something like the Bloodborne gameplay be brought into the Dark Souls universe such that making choices to dual wield and wear light armor brings about significant changes in how the game plays and makes you feel equal to someone who carries a shield.  Im imagining that below a certain weight and with certain weapons perhaps the fastpaced swooping type dodging becomes available at the expense of defense and poise while carrying heavy armor and a shield still plays more traditionally like Dark Souls.            It actually sounds like they might be doing something along these lines.,bloodborne,ctkmbgu,1,t5_31k9i

4759548,0,t1_ctuh7nw,Acetier logic. Its not ganking because I say its not! There are four hollows as you enter the Burg not two. There are five hollows before the bonfire and three of them immediately aggro on you more if you go further. The archers contribute to ganking. There are no solo giant hollows in Blighttown except the very first one you fight and its exceedingly difficult to not aggro more than one at a time.The game punishes you by fighting the pursuer.Are you fucking serious? Your post is giving me a headache with all these roundabout and falsefacts. Not only is that firebomb hollow extremely eacy to knock down with a throwing knife to melee him but the Pursuer despawns as soon as you leave the area and he wont pursue you. Thats not ganking even by your definition.Guess what? The drake you died to is visible as soon as you enter Heides. Maybe take your own advice and pay attention to your surroundings. You dont even have to fight it. Its more an obstacle than an enemy. You died once get over yourself. I didnt twist anything. I listed core facts about the game and then you said nah thats not true. You are a great troll I have to tell ya. I mean three enemies that throw things at you isnt a gank is the funniest thing Ive read all day.

4772251,0,t3_3g834z,My advice is to watch the first video or two of ENBs videos on Bloodborne. Itll show you the way. Heres my advice as a noob who was in your place.  Get to Cleric Beast to get your first insight. Just reach him and youll get what you need here. The first insight opens up the ability to level up using blood echoes at the doll in The Hunters Dream. Leveling up increases your defense making you harder to kill. Its subtle but it helps if you stack on Vitality for the first few levels.  Learn how the weapons work Be sneaky and get behind enemies. Pebbles are your friend early on dont be Fraid of using the blood vials. Theyre plentiful in the beginning  attack on your terms not the monsters termsThe videos of the first area really helped me understand the game better.

4926497,0,t3_3idioy,Ok  the version of weapon you are looking for is totally dependent on the gems you have on hand or will farm for to power it. For example the Lost LHSword has radial triangle and waning slots. This version would be okay for arcane buildout since it has a radial and triangle slot and since arcane type gems favor triangle and radial then you could use it. Now the waning slot is problematic  you will find arcane gems in waning gem form but you will probably obtain one due to offshape drop meaning shape of the gem does not match the dungeon type. Bolt and Fire gems are very easy to find in waning shape  just farm Loran type dungeons. IMO the best version of the LHSword for an arcan build would be the uncanny version since it has two radials and a triangle slot. You should be able to easily find arcane gems in radial and triangle form.The same rule goes for the LWheel  the Uncanny would the best version for arcane damage because it has two radials and triangle slot.Ultimately you will want to obtain all three versions of weapons so you can efficiently use ALL of the gems you have acquired todate.Good luck.,bloodborne,cufivb7,2,t5_31k9i

So I can see what you mean there but I cant think of any enemyboss in the game that behaves the way youre describing. Again I think youre just blaming the game for your inability to recognize or react to telegraphs. Its your issue not the games.gt yea...i need  tries but couldnt they make him like more health and harder hit?Why on earth would they do that? Thats the literal definition of artificial difficulty and would be pretty terrible design. If you want that do a BL run or something or go through to NG where everything can oneshot you. gti feel stupid when i dodge something that suposed to be direct hit but ends up like hit from boss ass?I cant tell what youre saying. You should try and articulate your points better.gtIm i allowes to say that this is funny in the way that instead of mimicing real hunter it boils down to some chinese im flying around shit? I spent like a good give minutes trying to get what you were saying here so correct me if Im wrong from what I gather youre not a fan of the games speed or flashy animation but im not clear on everything. For some reason you think Chinese people can fly? What I said about articulating your points better applies here as well.gtWE im going for platinum and i dont feel much of the challenge here ...thats why im posting.... not because it is hard....it is because i feel that tactics that works is have strong nervs no matter how this community think there is some tactitc shit that makes them so cool im playing cool hardcore gaming shit. it all boils dow to we are all playing some japanese crap that we all love but game itself is real mediocricy fun...Nobody thinks theyre hardcore for playing Bloodborne.

This isnt down to simply gameplay the build variety is simplified the weapon variety is slim to teach a new player to the series to find what weapon works for them and build around it subsequently why each weapon is actually perfectly well balance in most cases. Everything about this game is an introduction to the Souls series and if people like it enough then Dark Souls etc is there to be the step up.I think Bloodborne does exactly what it was set out to do ,bloodborne,cv16tjd,7,t5_31k9i

5157926,0,t3_3lmnso,Upper Cathedral gives chunks a set runes a badge and a chalice which is going to be extremely important for character building.Cainhurst gives chunks a Hunters tool a weapon some attire and a badge for more weapons and attire. Hypogean Gaol is an amazing source of early game twin shards besides Hemwick if youre looking to have two upgraded weapons. It also has a weapon a set and a rune. Plus it gates Paarl who provides a badge and allows you to finish Djuras questline.Old Yharnam has a chalice a fuckton of shards a weapon and a great fire resist set.Hemwick is a good source of early game cursed gems if you go there with  insight as the Mad Ones drop good triangle Phys gems as well as twin shards. Then theres the obligatory rune workshop toolIts advantageous to visit all of those areas as soon as they become available and in that sense they serve a lot of the same purpose the optional areas in Dark Souls did. The only area I feel is truly imbalanced as youve put it is the Nightmare Frontier. You can access the level during the Forbidden Woods at a point when youre already picking up twin shards left and right yet the area itself mainly drops you single shards and obsolete soul items. Then Amygdala itself is usually a pretty easy fight for most because it and the level overall is balanced for lower level players. The chalice is good for character building of course and there are a few good runes but overall I feel that level is by far the most disconnected from the rest of the game. The end of your post doesnt really make much sense at all though. For normal progression you go through the game and all its optional areas at the earliest possible and are better off for it later in your playthrough because of the echoes or loot you picked up . This isnt a fault in the game design at all. Its rewarding you for exploration and it works the exact same way in Dark Souls. Explore and do enough tinkering and youll be back at the undead asylum where you can grab the rusted iron ring and trivilize Blighttown. Or you can get the crest shield which is fantastic for blocking magic. Or you can finish the Catacombs early and get the rite of kindling and a mask. This is besides all the Souls earned. If this progression is too easy for you and that bothers you then maybe you need to impose restrictions on yourself. Or maybe you need a break from Souls. Perhaps youre too gud now,bloodborne,cv7q0j0,2,t5_31k9i

5351643,0,t1_cvvq660,gt It makes it a bit of a show of summation of your skillsgt One thing people like to mention is the drop in boss difficulty at the end of the game. Mergo is no Gascoigne and the Shadows are hugely more difficult than Micolash.I found subsequent encounters with Gascoigne in NG to be far far easier due to being familiar with dodge timing and the gun parry. This fight is brutal your first time around considering its the ndd boss. Heck I didnt even know there was a parry mechanic in the game at that time due to me not favouring guns as they did too little damage.gt I find that decision more interesting. The bosses become simpler and more straightforward when the world itself becomes more difficult.Thats absolutely true. I recall multiple attempts to unlock a shortcut the way to The One Reborn anyone? followed by a boss kill in  or  attempts. Come to think of it thats also how most Zelda games progress. The world itself is the encounter not the boss fight.,bloodborne,cvvqdso,2,t5_31k9i

That being said twinks can be killed too given that it is hard. However the previous games should have alerted you to the problem of twinks therefore you need to be wary of every invasion. I was invaded myself by a decked out twink in the nightmare frontier a simple parry and riposte does more than enough to end their tiny pool of health. or i also buffed a flamesprayer with bone ash and drank a led elixir. while the twink though he could just spam r i seared away his hp and he died. The game gives you so many way to deal with situations like this. Thats what makes the game unique if a player knows what to do a level  can easily kill a level . Ive done it numerous times. So instead of trying to blame the possiblity of twinking as a gamebreaking mechanic you can explore the many ways to combat them and reap the satisfying reward of OHKoing these depth  farming twinks.

You spend the whole game looking for a specific kind of blood but what youre meant to do and what you accomplish completely by accident while pursuing your wild goose is reveal the moons true form and then kill it.Hence Behold a Paleblood sky!The message is telling you your quest is to destroy the moon and replace it rising above the hunt.  Both literally and figuratively.  You just dont know that until youve already done it.You know like a really violent episode of Thats So Raven.You as a Hunter werent chosen because you could resist the Moon Presence.  Thats not an ability you have inherently.  Its something you gain by eating the umbilical cords.   Until you do that youre just a normal hunter who happened to show up on a particularly special hunt.

5398556,0,t3_3oz6tt,My educated guess on the church members is that theyre trying to keep you away from either the Upper Cathedral Ward the Forbidden Woods or both. The upper echelons of the Healing Church is something that they would certainly want average outsiders to keep away from since its the home of their terrifying experiments and the Great One Ebrietas. The Forbidden Woods meanwhile are obviously forbidden probably since it too is full of Eldritch secrets Byrgenwerth. I assume they dont just murder people during the daytime but maybe since its the night of the hunt they suspect youll unleash the Eldritch horrors theyre protecting more easily than a typical Yharnamite which is true. I assumed those troll dudes were just especially badly affected beastmen. They do still speak albeit rarely and in a baritone garble and they almost look bandaged together like theyre in advanced stages a horrific disease and are turning into a huge beast but arent quite there yet.As for the pigs...I have NO idea.

I originally notated the WL fragments when someone asked about comparing them to the tune that plays in Hunters Dream in the second half of the game or when you have enough insight which is called Moonlit Melody.Heres the imgur file of that  the composer is definitely working modally here as the Moonlit Melody sections are clearly in G Dorian and F Lydian. On this one youll see Ive also notated with colored brackets things that are motivically related        The order in which I did the WL fragments was the order in which they occurred on the YouTube clip Id been referred to in the other thread. They do always repeat in that order although when you come across one out in the wild they might happen to be on fragment  when you meet them the next one is always going to be fragment  and never fragment . Its their little loop. I do think if it has any modal center at all it is Eb Lydian. Fragment  in that case would be articulating the modal tonic chord. However theres also so much overtone and pitchslidermanipulation happening there in postproduction that its really hard to satisfactorily corral that warbling into things that dont involve quartertones. ,bloodborne,cw930jd,2,t5_31k9i

5547168,0,t1_cwkjrru,Sure! Well Ill start with parrying. At the beginning of the game you were given a gun. If you shoot an enemy right as theyre starting an attack they will be staggered. Walk up to their face and press R when theyre staggered the enemy will take a knee for a second basically and youll do a critical. It takes a bit of practice to get the timing down for every enemy but its worth it!Bloodborne also gives you another method to do a lot of damage backstabbing. Its hard to pull off but if you manage to do it you can get a lot of damage on them. What you need to do is execute a fully charged R attack where you hold R until the weapon glows and makes a little ding on the back of your enemy and theyll be staggered differently with their back facing you. R their back and youll do a critical. The rally system is also important to learn. Take any damage in Bloodborne and youll see for a few seconds after that your character is slightly glowing. Look at your health bar and you can see the difference between the amount of damage you just took orange if I recall correctly and the health you have left in red. During that small window where you glow you have the chance to attack enemies and regain whatever health they took from you. It is important to note that you should always be careful with it though never freak out and frantically mash your opponent to make up for whatever health they take from you. Always stay calm is a good piece of advice for the whole game. Another thing I just thought about that I cant believe I forgot to mention earlier is how your weapons work. Most weapons in the game have a one handed mode and a trick mode. Press L to access the trick mode. It gives you a different usually more damaging move set. What weapon and gun combo did you choose at the beginning?For lore and combat videos VaatiVidya on YouTube is a good place to start. Hes the most popular and his video on the overall story of the game is really good. I do recommend that you hold off on it until you beat the game though. Believe me its so cool to see everything that you noticed while playing come together like that. ,bloodborne,cwkoe34,6,t5_31k9i

5644126,0,t3_3sbzc6,I think that hes Eileens master and he became bloodaddled from doing his job. So the way I see it is the Hunter of Hunters is one at a time and the previous one trains the next one. If hes her master he was probably around for the Cainhurst massacre and picked up the helmetChikage by either killing executioners who came back bloodaddled or hunting vile bloods alongside the executioners. Heres an interesting part of the theory though what if the final test is to hunt the master because in doing their job they become an appropriate target for a hunter of hunters. After all you become bloodaddled by killing hunters and thats the entire job of the Hunter of Hunters. It helps that Eileen doesnt sound particularly old to me just very tired of the world and her duty.

5758278,0,t3_3u0g3d,Curious about what you had to say about the weapons supposed garbage scaling. Looking at the wiki while the  data is still inconclusive looking at the scale for the base weapon doesnt look terribly different to the weapons we have now. I feel like you simply have a bias for your Holy Blade simply due to stat allocation. On top of that with the changes to the scaling gems though it could be a bug as of yet no one knows these weapons could also be made to meet higher potential. I feel you might have been a little unfair in your judgment to the weapons but I sill need to wait and see. It is annoying though that despite finding those weapons unless you came in with mats prepared ahead of time they will just be set aside for the rest of the dlc as catching them up isnt terribly possible right away.,bloodborne,cxavaon,1,t5_31k9i

5763470,0,t1_cxb8fv9,Nice! Good work on getting some new stuff and making some progress. So first off you dont lose Shards when you die. The only stuff you lose upon death is Echoes which are honestly the least valuable thing in the game since its pretty easy to get them back just by killing some more guys. So dont stress too much about them. Theyre important but easier to recover than anything else. Second youve got a few ways to get back without losing them. You return by using a Lamp right? So your goal if you decide to return is to get back to that Lamp in one piece. Youve got a few options. I recommend running at the beginning. You dont have to kill everything. You can run past some enemies. This is useful to get through an area quickly either to advance or to return back. I do not recommend this unless youre actually going somewhere and you know exactly how to get there. On your first run through an area be thorough both in exploration and killing. Later on youll want to do this to maybe get back to a boss quickly or to get back to a Lamp. Just do make sure that you watch your back. Enemies wont follow you forever but they will for a bit. The most important thing here is to understand what happens to Echoes when you die. Sometimes theyll be a pool of glowing blood on the ground. If youre close to it you wont miss it. Run into that and hit X. Youll retrieve them. Alternatively unlike Dark Souls which only had the pool of blood enemies can actually pick them up now. If this happens look in the area for an enemy with bright glowing eyes. Hes the one with your Echoes. So he should be your main target just dont be stupid and risk everything to collect them again. Because if you do and then you die without retrieving them those Echoes are gone forever. Until you get them back of course by getting more kills. Youll also get these items called Bold Hunters Mark. Theyre these golden things with the Bloodborne symbol on them. They are one use only items but you can collect as many as you want that teleport you back to the Lamp that you last used. Be aware it does take a few seconds to work and you also have to hit a confirmation prompt so dont do it in the middle of combat. Just in case you didnt know you can equip items like this in the Start menu. At the bottom theres a bunch of open squares. Fill them up with your items. When youre playing hit the down button on the DPad to cycle through them then Square to use it. I recommend saving these for surprise boss fights that youre not prepared for when you have tons of Echoes or for a situation where you are far away from the Lamp and its a dangerous trek back. Hope this helped! Happy Hunting!,bloodborne,cxbifvd,1,t5_31k9i

5774684,0,t1_cxcwhx7,CONTDThis arrangement is intended to be temporary. Laurence leaves to try solving the issue but his use of the blood gets the better of him and he becomes the first Cleric Beast. He dies and his skull is venerated as a holy relic.Ashen Blood hits Old Yharnam. People are dying. Antidote isnt enough. The Church ignores Laurences adage and treats the citizens with beast blood in a desperate attempt to heal them. The citizens are healed but begin transforming into beasts.With the original Hunters now operating from their home base in the Dream rather than the Waking World the Church forms its own Hunters based on the Executioners. Its also possible the Executioners are folded in to the Church in the absence of Logarius. Ludwig is Gehrmans replacement and leads a civilian militia. These new Hunters attempt to contain the scourge but it grows worse.There is another attempt to contact the Great Ones but instead the Red Moon is summoned over Old Yharnam and the population are fully transformed. The Church burn the town down and seal it off.As a cover story the beast plague is blamed on outsiders. Yharnam becomes gradually more xenophobic as a result.Ludwig finds an enchanted glowing sword which speaks to him. While the blade cannot be replicated exactly copies are made for his Hunters.Willem learns of the horror caused by the Blood Moon. He also forgoes his adage and begins experimenting with the parasites he finds in the body of Kos. This creates Rom the first human  Great One hybrid who is though mindless powerful enough to hold back the Red Moon. Rom is dumped in the lake to hide her.Willem further experiments with the parasites but ends up going insane  senile. Those who remain at Byrgenwerth are transformed into the Gardens of Eyes.Messengers creatures who inhabit the dreamlands and may be the spirits of the dead begin drawing humans into the dream where they meet with Gehrman and become Hunters. They must work for Gehrman for one night after which they die and wake up as if the experience were just a bad dream.Ludwig gives in after prolonged exposure to the corrupted blood transforming into a beast.Maria Laurence Ludwig and countless other deceased hunters are likewise drawn into the dreamlands with the death of their physical bodies. This is caused by Kos who now exists in the Dreamlands and hates the Hunters for what they have done. Laurence loses his mind completely and lays delirious on the altar of a cathedral built from his memories. Maria awakens in a nightmarish version of the orphanage which is itself connected to the fishing hamlet that haunts her. Like Logarius she martyrs herself to act as a barrier in the hopes of preventing anyone repeating the mistakes of the past. Ludwig finds himself in a river flowing with the blood of his untold victims losing his humanity without the aid of the voices from his sword.Micolash an ambitious scholar forms his own faction within the Church the School of Mensis. Micolash believes the answer to humanity ascending lies with Kos. Mensis attempt to continue Willems work and succeed in contacting the Amygdala great ones but things go wrong and their lecture hall is drawn into the Nightmare. Micolash and other scholars avoid this fate and believe the answer lies in summoning the Red Moon again.Finding their own Cord of the Eye Mensis try to contact a great one. Micolash intends this to be Kos but instead he summons the Wet Nurse who has stolen Mergo the child of the Pthumerian Queen to use as a surrogate. Most of Mensis are drawn into the Nightmare by the Wet Nurse.However a barrier exists between the Nightmare and the Waking World and they can only cross over during the Red Moon which is held back by Rom. A stalemate is reached with Micolash trapped in the Nightmare fruitlessly searching for Kos and the vengeful queen Yharnam unable to locate Mergo who is being held by the Wet Nurse.The remnants of Mensis left in the Waking World hatch a plan to summon the Red Moon by means of a massive blood sacrifice.Beast outbreaks grow steadily worse due to the spread of beast blood through ministration. Hunts are declared more and more frequently and what qualifies as a beast becomes increasingly vague so that transformed Yharnamites can still act as Hunters. The Church know that the cause is Beast Blood but continue to blame foreigners for polluting Yharnams purity. Hunters can now target foreigners as well as beasts.The Choir the thinkers of the Church venture into the labyrinth in search of a solution and find the Isz chalice and in turn Ebrietas a Great One who was left behind when the others ascended into the dream.Ebrietas blood stimulates arcane powers and does not cause beastliness so the Church begin experimenting with it slowly transforming their own servants into a form reminiscent of the Pthumerians. However the Clerics continue to take in Beast Blood as a form of communion transforming into beasts like the one we fight on the bridge presumably the captain of the last hunt.Amelia one of the vicars who replaced Laurence is at a loss and prays to his skull in the hopes of a divine revelation.Our character suffering an illness is drawn to Yharnam in search of healing. Some time before our ministration we hear a voice maybe a Great One maybe the kind Ludwig heard its unclear. All we remember is Seek Paleblood to transcend the Hunt which we hastily scrawl down on a scrap of paper. Paleblood is the name of the ritual by which the Red Moon is summoned as it metaphorically draws the blood from the sky into the moon leaving a bloodred moon in a sky that according to Miyazaki looks like a corpse drained of blood.Our character kills the transformed Amelia then heads to Byrgenwerth and kills Rom breaking down the barrier and allowing the Great Ones to descend and the ritual to commence.The Yahargul ritual is performed turning the captured citizens of Yharnam into blood before petrifying them. Sinister bells resonate with the Red Moon but rather than summon a Great One they instead resurrect the dead as a single sentient pile of corpses The One Reborn.A great one possibly Oeden impregnates Arianna who is a suitable host because of her Cainhurst blood. She gives birth to an infant Great One but dies. Her child also dies and reveals that it had one third of the eye cord inside it.Our character fights through Yahargul and breaks into the Nightmare of Mensis where we find Micolash still trying to contact Kos and Yharnam looking for Mergo. We defeat the Wet Nurse and save or kill depending on how you feel Mergo. Either way Yharnam is grateful and presumably returns to Pthumeru Ihyll. We find a further third of the cord of the eye which was either used by Micolash or found inside Mergos body depending on your preferences. Refusing to submit to Gehrman we defeat him in combat and reveal the Moon Presence who embraces us like a new child. However! An infant Great One has the PRECURSOR to the Cord of the Eye but weve managed to put together a COMPLETE cord. This sends the Moon Presence crazy and it suddenly perceives us as a threat and attacks. Defeating the Moon Presence we complete the work of Willem and Laurence evolving beyond human limitations.Youre a kid now youre a squid now.,bloodborne,cxcwj52,16,t5_31k9i

5787413,0,t3_3ufm8v,Similar like you I got troubles with it and could not find much help through summoning. I suggest this strategy The basic idea is staying in front of it dodge its sweep attacks and dash in and hit once or twice when it lows its head after a move then dodge away. You can do the same for the nd phase but the window of lowing its head is shorter. You can try shooting it down with bone marrow ashes. Anyway the key of this fight is being extreme patient.

Phase  wasnt that bad thanks to parring but phase  for me was just random carnage with boss flying all around the area dropping blood bombs and spamming  degree attacks like an asshole.  . Ludwig. Almost all of his attacks shotted me during his phase  and he kept spamming his charge as soon as I went close to do some damage and he was first DLC boss so I really hate this phase. Phase  on the other hand was pretty cool.  . Lady Maria. Hands down my favourite DLC boss and one of the best bosses in the game. Nothing about her is cheap or stupid or unfair. Its a straight up duel between two best hunters.  . Living Failures. I killed them on my nd try almost without any effort and at the time I was very glad cause after Ludwig I thought the next boss will take days to kill but now after completing DLC and killing all bosses I cant help but think that Living Failures fight wasnt needed at all.  ,bloodborne,cxg0gfu,1,t5_31k9i

5821614,0,t3_3uxxvz,You start by getting the Pthumeru Chalice from Old Yharnam. This will make a Depth  dungeon that is always the same. By using this chalice to make a dungeon you can then use chalice search and codes to join any randomly generated Depth  Pthumeru dungeon. The second boss of the regular Pthumeru dungeon will give you the Pthumeru Root Chalice which lets you generate your own Depth  dungeons. The final boss gives you the Central Pthumeru Chalice which lets you make a Depth  dungeon that is always the same.Just like the first makingnot clearing Central Pthumeru will let you join other Depth  Pthumeru dungeons. Killing the second boss will get you the Root chalice to make Depth  dungeons and the final boss will give you the Lower Pthumeru chalice for Depth .This pattern applies to all other chalices as well. Once you reach Depth  the last you will get the Root chalice from the end boss instead of the second. Different types of chalices are found elsewhere  the Hintertomb chalice is somewhere in Central Pthumeru and the Ailing Loran and Great Isz chalices are dropped by optional bosses in the main game.,bloodborne,cxiqln1,1,t5_31k9i
5821935,0,t1_cxhwo4h,guess you didnt read any of the item descriptions. the gatling gun hunter you kill in the BSB cave in hunters nightmare? he was one of djuras apprentices. his gatling gun says so. and the item descriptions about maria amp the rakuyo clearly state that these events happened while she was a young hunter and that gehrman trained her. he probably led the invasion of the fishing hamlet himself frankly. it would make sense because when you kill the orphan of kos and speak to the doll she says gehrman is suddenly sleeping better.edit and these are just two specific examples of why it cant have been more than like...  or  years ago at most. unless you use the time is convoluted excuse or that characters in bloodborne can live for extreme lengths of time this all has to have happened in the lifetimes of the main characters. willem is an old man now. he founded byrgenwerth. the healing church split off from him but a lot of time must have passed between the founding of byrgenwerth perhaps when willem was a young man and the invasion of the fishing hamlet. so this might have happened when willem was a middle aged man... but that doesnt make sense because in the cutscene triggered by touching laurences skull in the grand cathedral we see a young laurence and an already old willem. that makes it seem more plausible that some of the characters or at least willem are very long lived or that time is convoluted. but since time is convoluted can be used to defend my theory too we are ignoring it. it seems most likely that the timeline doesnt fit perfectly together. it didnt fit perfectly in any of the souls games. it wasnt meant to fit perfectly because it probably wasnt planned out in advance and it just wasnt identified as important by the developers. nonetheless i just dont see any evidence that the developers intended to suggest this was an event from a very long time ago.i think my theory that it happened fairly recently wins out even if just by occams razor. without any evidence to the contrary we have to assume that the age amp time aspects of the game are pretty much normal. the only way to explain these events happening  years ago is to say that these characters willem and djura at least since gehrman is probably dead by the time of the main game have been living for  years. that of course is possible but theres no evidence for it and its not a simple explanation. its a perfect example of a stretch. a simple mental gymnastic maneuver but a gymnastic maneuver nonetheless. it is perfectly plausible that the hunters dream kept djura artificially young for many years but it is not plausible that it did the same for willem because willem is not and never was a hunter. moreover i dont think the hunters dream could even exist until gehrman died in the waking world so that means willem couldnt have been artificially sustained during the DLCs events.,bloodborne,cxis4a7,1,t5_31k9i

5850106,0,t3_3vac9l,Im not sure if its been mentioned here anywhere already but I think your summary of the Dunwich Horror is a bit off. As I recall the actual horror itself was the twin of the Wilbur. The professors from Arkham believe that the Whateleys were calling a creature into our realm to destroy it right? But at any rate it wasnt as if when Wilbur died the horror appeared because Wilbur was left in charge of it when his grandfather died. He and his grandfather had to make several alterations to the house to contain the horror as it grew.

5876612,0,t1_cxpxmvb,Things that made my life easierDont be frustrated if you lose your blood echoes. Levels dont matter too much on your first playthrough so if you lose a bunch of echoes you shouldnt feel bad. Theyre easy to come by once you get the hang of the game.Buy Blood vials after leveling. Youll probably end up with a bunch of leftover echoes so you might aswell buy vials or bullets. I personally found it really frustrating to always be out of vials when I first started playing. Learn to be aggressive. If you havent noticed the game has a rally mechanic which gives you a chance to heal back up when you take damage. And when it comes to boss fights remember that the longer you fight a boss the more chances you have to make mistakes. Most bosses are easier when you are on the offensive.Weapons are pretty much your own prefrence. Any weapon in the game is good enough but I would recommend the Saw Cleaver. In my any many others opinion its the best weapon in the game. The thing that sets it apart from the other starting weapons is its good DPS and the fact that its a serrated weapon. Serrated weapons do increased damage on beasts. the cane is also a serrated weapon in its transformed mode but I prefer the Cleaver because of its better damage per swing and relatively fast swing speed. The fact that its the first weapon you get is great because then you can upgrade it whenever you get materials.Dont bother with chalice dungeons. If you dont know what they are they are very generic dungeons with  bosses in each one. They get boring really quick and theres nothing you need in them. For the end game you can get the best blood gems from dungeons but you wont need them on your first playthrough. About  or  bosses are fun and to get  on the game youll need to do about  bosses most of which are reused main story bosses or generic mobs made harder. Ive only done the chalice dungeons once to get the Platinum Trophy for the game and Im never ever doing the whole shenanigans again.,bloodborne,cxpyexj,1,t5_31k9i

For picking your second weapon slot read on.For what to do with the  levels Id say pick one of the three key stats for you.If you invest in STR youll want to grab the Boomhammer tonitrus or Loggy Wheel as all scale from STR but get a nice boost from your ARC stat.If you Invest in SKL you can use the Burial Blade or Blades of Mercy efficiently as both have solid SKL scaling and a built in Arc damage buff.Now if you invest in ARC which is what I recommend you have a good few options. For starters get at least  Arc this lets you use all the hunter tools and will help you wreck shop at a distance. As for your weapon slots Ludwigs Holy Blade with an arcane gem is amazing a Threaded Cane also takes Arcane very well. If you pour all  into Arc the Kos Parasite with Milkweed is a TOP choice for you as it scales with Arc amazingly and has an excellent Moveset.For Guns just use the hunter Pistol or Blunderbuss and upgrade them for damage dont worry about bloodtinge.,bloodborne,cxqsssm,2,t5_31k9i

5899592,0,t1_cxs0bbp,well. its .. but I would assume its basically the same.. Because at the beginning you have low vit so the enemies do big damage comparatively..Later when you get back they do less damage because your vit is higher..But at low vit the  HP you have to have to not die are just smaller numbers..As I said. I get mysef grabbed by that amygdala near oedon chaopel next to the capelesshunter stuff.So I heal up  get that set and then let myself get grabbed by amygdala because it gives  Insight for like what two bloodvials..

5913321,0,t3_3w9bll,Mostly because I believe its just a matter of time before someone makes a mistake and healing during a fight drags it out. Also because PvP is forced upon anyone that is trying to play multiplayer. I get that the way PvP functions fits the game brings more to it than just good ole TDM...but since there is no way to cooop without PvP forced upon you..please as an invader dont drag it out.Just hunter up and realize you are going to die die with some respect and invade again. But the person that just runs and panic heals gets annoying. I cant be bothered as I am being summoned to help someone for PVE and somone invaded our game if youre the host then by all means run and panic heal. This is how I feel about it. I would say about  out of  invaders I fight is a fun and entertaining fight. The rest are just blind twitch dodging and pistol spam...why heal and drag it out. Also all the PvP I have encountered on this game is people invading a game i have been summoned to or summoned someone else I have never once intentionally engaged in PvP. What I dont understand is why FROM thought that making coop wonky and cumbersome then forcing PvP on people was a good idea. Why not have a dedicated PvP server? or maps? How awesome would a full kill on sight map with say like  different hunters be? I would actually enjoy that and PvP. let people that are not actively seeking PvP still be able to enjoy multiplayer. ,bloodborne,cxurou5,-1,t5_31k9i

5923330,0,t3_3wfyo0,Note I can not speak for Lords of the Fallen as i have never played it my answers apply only to Dark Souls  and Bloodborne.. The games can be VERY challenging but the key is to understand everything is a pattern there is  or more ways to dodge deflect or block every attack you encounter in the game but it will not hold ur hand and tell you how to do it u have to watch the enemies careful and figure it out urself and no you can not adjust the games difficulty it has a single default difficulty level and it gets harder with each New Game .. Puzzles mostly revolve around finding keys and hitting levers to open doors nothing too complex. DS has hidden walls u either check the wall hit it with ur weapon or use a special stone to reveal. BB only has a few hidden walls u strike with ur weapon in whats called the Chalice Dungeons. The worlds are more like a metroidvania u can freely walk back and forth between the areas at any time but they are mostly linear in a somewhat maze like pattern it wont always be a straight clear path but every path either leads to a dead end of treasure or another area eventually plenty of exploration to be done for tucked away corners and hidden ladders and such.. When u kill enemies u gain souls in DS and blood echos in BB. Despite the names they are the same thing ur currency u spend them to buy new items weapons or to increase ur stats. Raising one stat by one point counts as  level for ur character each level has its own cost that raises with each level i.e.  souls at lvl  to raise  stat  souls at lvl  to repeat and so on each stat has an impact on what ur character can do and the gear they can use. You can increase ur Health which is obvious increase ur stamina bar which is used to do almost every action increase ur equipment load the heavier ur weapons and armor are the slower u will move and it can hinder ur ability to dodge if u rely on that increase spell slots increase str which ups ur physical dmg especially with str scaling weapons and allows u to use stronger and stronger weapons like greatswords hammers and crossbows increase dex for the same with agile weapons like spears rapiers and bows increase adaptability to increase the speed of ur movement actions and increase invincibility frames during dodges increase int to make sorcerysome hex spells do more damage and have more spell uses and finally increase Faith for the same with miraclessome hexes. its a very deep RPG system with lots of possibilities. That all applies to DS btw bloodborne has a few stats that differ like bloodtinge and arcane instead int and fth but they basically operate in the same principle but BB over all is a much faster paced game no defense just offense and dodging. And lastly there are no Perks u start with every combat skill u can perform and gain no new ones as u level armor and weapons will come with additional passive effects and special attacks but theres no trick to using them outside of meeting the stats to wield the weapon.I hope this helps i have enjoyed these difficult hair ripping rage inducing games since Dark Souls  came out but they can be very VERY infuriating to first get into unless you find a reason to love the games on your own terms. I rage quit and sold DS after clearing the first story hurdle and having no idea where to go next and finding death everywhere but i watched other people play it realized my own mistakes and fell in love with the setting and story that pushes me to trudge through these nightmares for the sweet taste of victory and that little kernel of lore that will bring a tear to ur heart.,bloodborne,cxw2vvj,3,t5_31k9i

What I did is I stayed out of the range of her swipes and tried to bait the hand slam. Then I just spammed attack either on her hands or the head since you do almost no damage when you hit her legs and tail. I just dodged the lasers and dodged her swipes when she takes out her arms for more range just dodge to the direction of her hand so if the swipe comes from the right dodge to the right just before it hits you. The only scarry attack is her jump which Im pretty sure can  shot you with not enough vitality so watch out when she jumps. Also when she rips of her arms to have more range notice that the hand slam has a little explosion around it and she does it more than once so watch out when you go for a hit.,bloodborne,cxwlz1n,2,t5_31k9i
5929784,0,t1_cxwx04l,Thank you for the link! i was raking my brain trying to think where it had been mentioned that Great Ones place curses outside of what unfolds in the DLC. Oedon is definitely a major player in Bloodbornes story hes responsible for Rom turning into the Vacuous Spider according to Micolash and Ariannas baby of course. But so far it looks like everything dealing directly with the Plague of beasts connects to Paleblood. it is possible since Oedon has this grand Father like visage in the story that when mergo was taken by the School of Mensis Oedon may have commanded Paleblood to direct us once we were deemed worthy enough to handle the trial but id like to find some more evidence some mention linking Oedon to Yharnam at the least to support it.,bloodborne,cxwxccm,1,t5_31k9i

5961076,0,t3_3x1qly,TLDR Ludwig is strong and aggressive as hell but once you learn his moveset hes as fair as can be.I promise Im not here to blow my own wiener but let me give you my experience.First time I fought Ludwig it took cooping with my cousin for  hours before we finally downed him. We were playing in NG. But by the end we had learned every tell and every move and knew how to avoid getting hit by every attack. When we finally beat him we sat back for a second reflecting on the fight and thought You know it actually IS a fair fight once you learn everything he has to throw at you.Ludwig is similar to every boss in the game in that he does telegraph his moves. The difference is he is PUNISHING and often times you die over and over before you even get a chance to learn anything. Also just when youve finally learned all he has to offer he changes forms and now you have a SECOND form to learn all the moves for haha.Now with that being said just having played him again now in NG I solod him in about  tries. Patience was the key to this boss and I know that if you are ever to fight him again youll have a much easier time. Happy hunting! ,bloodborne,cy110d2,2,t5_31k9i

At your level the cost is usually about  to level up.To level go back to the Hunters Dream when you have a good amount of Blood Echoes and talk to the doll note you need insight for this to work. If youve seen Cleric Beast though that means you do have at least  insight. If not try to find an item called madmans knowledge and use it then come back to the Hunters Dream.

Abandoned WorkshopThe nameless moon presence beckoned by Laurence and his associates. Paleblood. Lore note in the lecture building.Moon presence is definitely a Great One. Nothing is said about them being ancient and the moon presence isnt directly related to chalice dungeons. Ebrietas is explicitly described as a left behind great one.

Ghermans congratulations at the end is easily interpreted differently once you learn that release from the Dream is something that he wants for himself Im thinking of that nifty piece of dialogue you discover when hes sleeping sometime midgame. More than releasing you he wants you to take him out of it all and he wants to die a Hunter at the same time. Hes also a proxy bound by the Moon Presence right?

6125458,0,t1_cykmzk0,They like that because thats how the industry has educated them. Developers are less passionate and more money driven in this day and age. This industrys gotten too big for its own sake in the past few years and its in the interest of the people running the show to make it even bigger by pandering more to the masses with easily digestable products to reach a larger demographic and earn more money. This is also why were seeing way more sequels from established franchises rather than new original IPs.What I hate about games like Witcher getting THIS much recognition is that it sends the wrong message. Devs arent being encouraged to make a game that they know will only pander to a smaller demographic and end up selling  millions like Bloodborne when they could just make some easily accessible thing with less effort while slapping in some mass appealing stuff such as the pointless open world fad of late and scream many times over how much the map size if  times bigger than skyrims! for marketing purposes and sell  millions like Witcher . That will ultimately make these games like Bloodborne which are genuine works of passion with lots of care and attention to detail applied to them become even more rare to the point they stop being a thing altogether because the standards are as loose as they could possibly be AND theres a push for them to become even more dilluted. I dont like this notion that its the product that should lower itself instead of the person who should strive to perform better.

Closest I get is Cthulhu which isnt even really close but isnt entirely dissimilar.Dagon fits into the story better Especially with the Innsmouth connection but obviously the name is totally different and Dagon isnt described as A fucking jellyfish mother fucker on the beach.tldr Kos is probably its name for realsies but the confusion is a result of how little anyone in Yharnam actually knows about the Great Ones.,bloodborne,cyp4trl,2,t5_31k9i

6161065,0,t1_cypnsoo,Yep thats how I feel too. Ill usually just blindly play through an area unlocking any shortcut I can find and so far have had a pretty good sense as to when a boss was coming up so I try to spend my echoes if I feel Im close to one. Although BSB surprised me because I thought he was a normal enemy from far away and caught aggro before I could spend my echoes and level. Luckily she wasnt too bad and I had a lot of antidote on me. Watching videos after clearing an area really helps me a lot because I like to clear each place a second time finding everything. This is how I found the secret entrance to the old hunter dream area  in the tall tower near cathedral. This is also how I found out after the fact that kidnapping wasnt such a bad thing as the place you get taken is now my ultimate farming spot for shardstwin shards not to mention the ridiculously good mace and k echoes every few minutes. This is pretty much my ideal way to enjoy the game because Im able to enjoy a great challenge and still be able to satisfy my obsession with collecting everything it really bothers me and takes from my enjoyment knowing I missed stuff. Its only gone wrong for me once because now I know where the late game boss is at the place you get taken to when kidnapped and it would have been a cool surprise. Fortunately I dont plan on fighting him yet and running into him on accident may have frustrated me a bit. ,bloodborne,cypy71w,0,t5_31k9i

6168245,0,t3_401mbu,Its probably best for a nd or rd playthrough.Slight spoilers names aheadThe utility spells are worth it if you like using them Empty Phantasm Shell Beast Roar Messengers Gift. Augur of Ebrietas can also parry now unless you want it to do more damage these will all work fine without extra ARC stat investment.The other spells are damage dealers and will want for more ARC stat investment consider  or even  ARC if you like using Tiny Tonitrus and A Call Beyond. The way the tools scale is more linear and doesnt cap at  you can take ARC up to  for benefits to your damage A Call Beyond is satisfyingly destructive at this level.Additionally with up to  ARC you can get great elemental damage on weapons. All weapons have an ARC scaling rating to them E thru S with S being the highest. However if a weapon has inherent Physical damage including BluntThrust only it will convert to whichever element type you may slot a gem for if a Saw Cleaver gets a Fire gem with  Fire damage itll convert the base damage plus the  from the gem to Fire plus any attribute bonuses for your stat investment depending on how well the weapon scales in ARChow upgraded it is more upgrades yields better scaling so weapons increase in damage more than just the AR raised with each upgrade represented in the  to the right of your weapons base damage.If you have a split damage weapon Blade of Mercy Tonitrus that has Physical and another type of damage you need either Physical or that elements type of gems to increase damage. PhysBlood weapons are an exception increasing Physical damage will increase both but usually you only attack with Phys or Bloodtinge depending on the form and its attacks but not both. You can figure this all out by seeing how your damage changes as you apply gems so dont use Phys and Elemental to cancel each other out.,bloodborne,cyqrkm8,4,t5_31k9i

6197842,0,t3_40ggh6,It seems odd to me that quotes from the guide are now being used to interpret lore... Anyway...Other than the guide I dont think theres any decent evidence that Byrgenwerth killed Kos  There arent even any visible wounds on Kos body. It doesnt make sense.As for what happened in the Hamlet from what I gathered Byrgenwerth hunters Gherman Maria and perhaps others? slaughters and brutally experimented on the citizens of the fishing hamlet due to their changes  Byrgenwerth wanted to learn as much as possible from them by any means necessary to further their own research.I think its safe to say the people of the hamlet worshipped Kos and Kos being a Great One which are known to be sympathetic nature bestowed changes upon the villagers. Presumably good changes but who knows. Because of their worship it seems they preyed to Kos to invoke its wrath on the Byrgenwerth hunters.Edit I would also like to add something that people seem to be forgetting  the villager at the start of fishing hamlet says mercy for the poor wizened child. It seems more likely to me that Kos washed up dead as per the Kos Parasite description and Byrgenwerth went to investigate finding that Kos was carrying a child. They then experimented on and killed said child Orphan of Kos. This and the other atrocities committed by Byrgenwerth caused them to invoke the wrath of Kos via prayer.,bloodborne,cyu4mxk,1,t5_31k9i

6345436,0,t3_42jjyi,Oedon may also be a duel reference to both Oedipus and nonGreek Odin the latter of which is associated with healing death royalty the gallows knowledge battle sorcery poetry frenzy and the runic alphabet. No blood though unfortunately. That being said Im not sure whom youre referring to when you say that characters gouge their eyes out in response to insight. However where Insight and Beasthood are inversely related gouging ones eyes out may lead to an increase in Beasthood. Theres not a direct connection between Oedon and Beasthood however there is an indirect connection between them via blood the essence of Oedon. In particular the Formless Oedon Oedon Writhe and Beasts Embrace rune all contain a nuance of blood as does the Moon rune and we know that when the red moon hangs low the line between man and beast is blurred. Thus Odin aside I wouldnt be surprised if the Oed in Oedon has its etymological roots in Oedipus.,bloodborne,czawmbx,1,t5_31k9i
6348719,0,t1_czb07pb,Keep in mind the skyboxes DO NOT MATCH the physical paths you walk.  Many angles and elevations do not quite work.  They are close.  So if you measure angles to the windmills from Cathedral Ward they wont match my map but if you physically walk there it will match my map.  The second windmill is also much lower in the actual world than it is in the skybox.  There also seem to be  castle Cainhursts!? when viewed from that location.  Even better there are ! Castle Cainhursts when you look around Hunters Nightmare That place is a copypasta frenzy.Iosefkas Clinic thankfully FROM put it in or increased the draw distance to show it from the forbidden woods skybox now is not quite in the right spot it is turned incorrectly but at least is is really close.  Now that the old abandoned workshop was added to the Cathedral Ward skybox or unhidden by reduced fog increased draw distance it looks perfectly correct.  The deep alleys where you get the waning fire gem is still not visible from anywhere else either and should be from the path towards Yahargul from Grand Cathedral.Many vistas in YaharGul are aproximiate for the background buildings.The bridge into Old Yharnam is way too elevated compared to the huge descent we make to get to the Old Yharnam Lamp but otherwise seems to be relatively in the right place horizontally.The facade of the Cathedral Ward from Old Yharnam and Central Yharnam the cliff facebridges etc. is a mess.  I think partly because Tomb of Oedon does not seem to exist other than while you are in it  I think they added that area and path later when they decided not to use Great Bridge as the transition to Cathedral Ward through the magic door we cant use.Skybox issues persist into the DLC also The bridge you fight the living failures on is higher than the astral sundial on the front of the building yet you walk straight across and UP.You did convince me to try to finish my DLC maps tonight so cheers to that.,bloodborne,czba1ik,3,t5_31k9i

Hes definitely slow enough for the Hunter to be able to start the animation it takes a second or two. I guess now that the real big stopping point might be Bed of Chaos. It would probably be just as hard for him to break the two chaos sapling things as it is for the Chosen Undead and jumping isnt really any better in Bloodborne than it is in Dark Souls. The other bosses can probably be handled through speed and the much better technology from Yharnam but Bed of Chaos is probably the real equalizer. ,bloodborne,czg2wum,1,t5_31k9i

6396265,0,t1_czgnztf,What aspects of eastern RPGs do you dislike?Another huge thing with BB is the lack of handholding that many modern games do. They have an area early in the game with notes for the controls and how to use things like the trick weapons or blood bullets but other than that and a few other relevant notes theres no tutorial mode nor map as you may have seen from previewing the game. The emphasis on good game design to help guide players on the right path is strong. The scaling of the different attack stats of STR SKL BLD and ARC are what determines your damage with different weapons but as long as you meet the base stat requirements you can use any weapon you please and everything is viable if you dedicate yourself to a couple weapons due to the limited resources. This is where some of the strategy might come into play the stats and how weapons scale off them can somewhat help you determine a build for certain stats.,bloodborne,czgou1v,2,t5_31k9i

6416970,0,t3_43lc9e,Just a forewarning forgive me if I sound kind of vague in terms of the DLC but I dont want to accidentally spoil you and give you information you didnt want haha.You can totally get by in BB with any weapon and the cleavercane are very solid choices.Have you seen the BoM moveset? Just a few days ago someone posted about how despite how cool it is they couldnt get it to work for them.My point is that if you have another target weapon and the BoM is just filler you might want to hold off on buying it. If you know you like it and want it and you plan to use it then feel free to go for it now. If not the cleavercane combo will carry you through just fine and focusing on them would be nice. Of course if you feel like you have money to spend just go for the BoM and try it out.Im no arcane expert but I do believe the DLC has some weapons that scale very nicely with skill and can be buffed with firebolt paper.Some more comments on the DLC below The DLC is generally recommended for higher levels though you can access it relatively early. You can nab some new weapons without crashing into a metaphorical wall with a lot of running and dodging.,bloodborne,czj1m6q,1,t5_31k9i
6417119,0,t3_43lby0,Flamesprayer and Rosmarinus are best used with Arcane builds.  Much better damage potential with high Arcane.  Flamesprayer melts crowds of beastskin.  Rosmarinus is particularly useful in chalices as many enemies there are weak to arcane damage.  The problem I have with these weapons is that they dont flinch enemies though so theyre best used for damage over time fired in short bursts here and there.  Remember to use oil urns with Flamesprayer and bone marrow ash can be applied to both sprayers.  The shotguns are slower than the pistols both in firing and recovery but they hit harder and will stagger most enemies if you miss the parry.  They also have a wider spread which makes it much easier to hit faster enemies like dogs.  Shotguns are great for dogs.  Hit one pointblank while its jumping and youll see what I mean.  Really both types of guns are great in most situations so it comes down to personal preference.  The Gatling Gun can have high damage if gemmed properly but I use it more for its stunlock potential.  Note about the Piercing Rifle applied bone marrow ash affects every enemy hit by that bullet.  Great for narrow hallways.,bloodborne,czj285r,1,t5_31k9i

I had already lost hope of finding her so this came as a huge surprise.

Mainly because while From games requires mostly a strategy and precision which can be practiced those old games also required ridiculous reflexes most of the time so every playthorough is challenging. I can beat Bloodborne at BL  without dying with pretty much no problem at least base game only beaten DLC with  characters but I will never S DMC DMD Mission  for example even though I tried dozens of times.

With the bowblade try to get the Lost version since it is mainly used to shoot arrows so you might get the max damage output under this version while shooting arrows.The bow is a good weapon for big bosses like motherfucking Defiled Amy for example or annoying mobs like Brainsuckers at Isz or even the Fireball witches In Pthumeru Ihyll. Now for PvP well it depends strongly on your gameplay because personally Im terrible using it on PvP but Ive seen hunters that do pretty well with it.Oh and the Chikage if you have it on your plans is a must to have the Lost version it hits soooo hard with  BT in transformed mode.,bloodborne,czsjrky,1,t5_31k9i

6560290,0,t1_czx3gny,Tbf I got the witcher  and Im not a huge fan. The combat is horrible and I hate the potion and healing system. I like that they tried something different from other games but I personally dislike it. I think the combat controls really bad like geralt is made of jello. I love the story and the world but I also have a hard time figuring out and keeping track of how you do everything it just feels like a lot for a new person getting into the series. I really love a lot about the witcher especially when it comes to world building characters story and just about everything that doesnt involve combat and the alchemy system. Unfortunately I feel like I get pulled into that a lot when Im mid stride in something enjoyable and I get taken out of the game. I also am unsure about the crafting but I just dislike most crafting systems in general. I do feel like it does a lot of what I dislike about big open world RPGs better than almost all of its conpetition but I still dislike that it does them. I feel those games could improve a lot by abandoning some of the ideas for more simple ones and stop trying to make action and creation more in depth and complicated to match action rpgs especially since in the case of the souls series the action feels better and more fluid while maintaining its simplicity.,bloodborne,czxvzr8,-1,t5_31k9i

So Martyr Logarius Orphan and Gherman not Gascoigne since he is early enough in the game where youll deal good enough damage regardless as to your build and not Maria because brawling her to death is just as effective as parrying.  ,bloodborne,czybe3x,2,t5_31k9i

6707406,0,t1_d0d3eyc,Forcing players into pvp will never yield good results. At least in Dark  Souls  and  you could stay hollow and be fine. In Bloodborne you have to find the bell maiden and they can be quite hard to find. Even still Ive had someone invade just as I killed them. There is no way to limit pvp. Being human used to be a riskreward system but Bloodborne makes it a default feature. gt you can make the invader fight you where you want and if the invader wants to try and drag you out all you have to do is ring a resonant bell and force the invader into fighting you before help arrives. You can try and run through the level to the boss granted it can be difficult or you can hide and test the invaders patiencetime limit. These are valid strategies but they take time. Why even bother sitting there when you can disconnect or die? These behaviors stem from invasions being a hassle and little else for the people who do not enjoy them. Invading in Dark Souls  was a pain for everyone involved I am glad to hear they are bringing back the whole eye orb in . ,bloodborne,d0d3qac,0,t5_31k9i

The word forcibly could and probably does contrary to what I wrote before refer to cruel treatment by Byrgenwerth surgeons vivisecting live villagers looking for eyes instead of dead ones after the fact which would be a far greater cause for laying curses and for keeping the Fishing Hamlet a secret worth employing an assassin like Brador to keep covered up.

Personally compared to other Fromsoft games the health pools for the main player characters in Bloodborne are really low.  In NG and on most bosses are going to  shot you with even  VIT and a couple of health runes.  That being said I dont think its a huge difference from  to  VIT since youre basically gonna get killed really fucking fast either way.  Its the basic difference from EVERYTHING two shotting you to MOST THINGS two shotting you.  Also I would focus more on BT than skill if youre using the Reiter and the Evelyn.

So say you have the Ihyll root chalice. Make a fetid rotten cursed Ihyll and you can then make any glyph dungeon for Ihyll for free.

6852700,0,t1_d0t221r,In all seriousness you need to make sure you have Visceral Attacks down.  Those giants that frequently carry bricks are good enemies to begin practice on.  Easiest way to get the timing is not when the attack begins but right before it would begin to do damage to you.  Or just while it would be.  Enemies have different opening intervals.Another one after the first is to learn to make openings.  For example enemies will have different attacks depending on your position or whether or not youre attacking.  Certain attacks are easier to parry and theyll have preferred conditions.During boss fights some of them are not humanoid...actually most of them arent.  This means that Parrying must be extremely precise.  Good luck.  Visceral Attacks can also be performed through a charge Heavy Attack on their perfect backside.

6930223,0,t1_d11umah,gtThey literally seeked beasthood to transcendThere is no evidence that supports this in the game.They however did try to experiment with controlling the scourge of beast. As stated by the Beast Embrace.Beast runeAfter the repeated experiments in controlling the scourge of beasts the gentle Embrace rune was discovered.When its implementation failed the Embrace became a forbidden runeThe rune was found after the attempts to control not during the proces mention where the Church is embracing the Beast Hood.Also your statement that the Clawmark rune shows that they were interested in becoming beasts is not true. The runs simply says that the user goes back to hishere state of beinga beast that finds warmthcomfort in blood. It does not state that the user wants to go back to that state only that they find their insticts going back to their primal state.Also the reason why the church knows a lot about beasthood is because they know about ascend and the way to do it. The way to do is so to seek eyes on the inside the way of Master Willem. However this way of ascending is going too slowly for Laurence and his followers the Church. Therefor they use the blood of the Old Ones however what they didnt knew was that using this blood the result was not ascending mankind but regressing mankind this they probably didnt knew when they started using the Blood. However at a certain point they crossed a line and couldnt back out of it and had to continue their road of trying to ascending using Old Blood,bloodborne,d11v6pt,5,t5_31k9i

6961646,0,t1_d11ulm7,... Im not angry but okay! I wish it didnt have to be personal to have a disagreement about an awesome game but whatevs. Caryll wasnt with the church though so his runes dont reflect the decisions of the church. He was with Byrgenwerth and Gerhman certainly didnt know about him as is implied by the rune tool description So Im not really getting why you think the runes imply the church sought out beasthood.And about Old Yharnam... it couldnt have been the church. The church tried to cover it up by sending in the powderkegs. Regardless of whether or not they knew the risks the definitely were trying to burn the place down not try to harness the power of the beasts in any way. They sealed Old Yharnam off from the rest of the city and were intent on never opening it again. This much is clear.Additional evidence that points to the Church being against beasts is how it is understood that Cleric Beasts are created. Essentially the longer a person suppresses the urge to turn into a beast the more of a beast they become. This is why the weak willed townsfolk of Yharnam only look halfbeast while higher members of the church turn into giant horrifying creatures such as Vicar Amelia. This indicates there is a general unwillingness to turn into a beast amongst the church members. This unwillingness can otherwise be understood as an expression of the churchs clear stance against beasthood.This is how I understand it. Byrgenwerth discovered the dungeons and with that the old blood they learned of the Great Ones and studied them finding that insight itself would guide them to ascend. Lawrence got greedy thinking the blood carefully used could heal people. This was true but in his folly he unleashed the scourge of the beast. To put down beasts the church created the Hunters Workshop which initially worked in secret to kill the beasts so the church could maintain power. Eventually the beasthood got out of the hand and the church had to up their game by creating church hunters. Nowhere did the church want the beasthood  they simply wanted it gone so they could continue their work.So I get what youre trying to say but your facts are a bit off and Id recommend doing some more research. No anger here just trying to help you get more insight. ,bloodborne,d15fsfx,1,t5_31k9i

7001164,0,t1_d19jn9l,My main gripe with Dark Souls now that Ive played Bloodborne is that a single trick weapon in Bloodborne has more different moves than any entire class of weapons from a Dark Souls game even though Dark Souls has more weapon customization its a pretty shallow system in that regard. Sure Dark Souls also has shield play or magic etc. which adds variety but that is the ONLY real variety to combat as far as weapons go Bloodborne is without a doubt the better game. Im excited to see what Dark Souls  brings to the table!,bloodborne,d19xcs6,2,t5_31k9i
7003933,0,t1_d19lmsc,After having played the heck out of Dark Souls  and  the best piece of advice I have ever come across for this game is that you should almost always be dodging througharound your enemy instead of away from them.  Obviously this doesnt count for AOE abilities but generally speaking you want to stay right on your enemys butt for  percent of fights.  Just dodge towards and through an attack as its coming and the Iframes will protect you. Your natural instinct will be to get away from the big scary guy flailing his arms around wildly but most bosses actually have mechanics that they only use when you have distance between each other specifically to punish and discourage that type of play style.  Just stick right to the guys legs and butt and dodge towards its back when you feel an attack coming.  After Dark souls defensive and tactical combat system where getting some space and reevaluating was the status quo it takes some getting used to before you get comfortable but just stay on them while you stick and move and you will come out on top eventually. ,bloodborne,d1a8nzf,2,t5_31k9i

Paarl is an optional boss as well so I dont see your issue with him. I have read all your posts and find them all lacking substance. The protagonist is not the main focus of the story because you are him. Why would you need to learn more about or empathize with yourself? You are the hunter and you have no memory so you must find out where you are and why. Pretty simple to me. No need to complicate it with your need to fit into a certain archetype of story. It is a standalone game with influences within a wide range. It is for you to decide in the end what the game is about. It seems you want the story to be handed to you as well as the gameplay. This game is for those who wish to make their own path and explore and discover through trial and error. I didnt like Demons Souls when I first got it but it was a challenge to me and that challenge is where the fun lies. Bloodborne is pretty hard when you first start out and for you to imply that it isnt when you gave up and never finished the game shows the dichotomy of your arguments.,bloodborne,d1b66p1,2,t5_31k9i

7042939,0,t3_4c33o5,The Moon rune dropped by the Brain of Mensis can shed some insight heh onto the relationship of the Make Contact gesture and the Brain itself. The wiki states that the Great Ones of the Nightmare are sypmathetic in spirit and when called upon will answer. The Make Contact gesture literally does what is intended caling upon a great one that great one being the Brain of Mensis. I guess if the secret was never revealed that one would just have to draw conclusions based on random item descriptions. Also based on the item description for Living String we can infer that the Brain of Mensis was a great one however it was corrupt and rotten. Thats why the gesture works as the Brain is a Great One itself and since it has been called upon it helps the player out even when its in its pathetic state. ,bloodborne,d1eoacf,2,t5_31k9i

7117790,0,t1_d1n4rcx,I know theres two conditions or situations for the snakes to come out. For me its always when theres one Shadow left.The fight isnt really easy but I always leave the caster for last. Its hard to fight the two while dodging the fireballs but after they transform the two sword wielders get long range armor breaking they send you flying attacks so fighting those two like that would be terrible.Kill the one with one sword first try to learn how to parry firing your gun just before an enemy finishes his physical attack animation. The mob men are pretty easy then you can try with the brick giants then you kill the one with the sword and candle his fire attack cant be parried and trying the make him use a physical attack can be a bit dangerous so just cut him up good carefully always hit them and save a bit of stamina to dodge away finally for the caster youll need to stay really close to him and this means youll need to dodge his attacks so you dont get hit a lot while trying to interrupt his snake summons. Your stats are more than fine specially your damage output but if youre using a heavy weapon you might want to up your endurance a bit. Dont always rely on charged Rs. If youre using STR try getting a faster weapon. Kirkhammer has a onehanded sword with fast attacks that I think scales off your STR stat. Theres also Ludwigs Holy Blade probably the best weapon in the game but to make it the best youll need to spend some points in Skill its badge is located in the Healing Church Workshop. And it might be helpful and sort of fun to bring the Leagues summons talk to Valtr in the shortcut thats just in the lamp and join the covenant hell give you the rune Impurity equip it and summon Henryk and Madaras their signs are just before the boss fight.Good luck!,bloodborne,d1n7dp7,1,t5_31k9i
7118365,0,t3_4d24gz,In my experience circling clockwise and up close to bosses tends to screw with them. This works for most and i do mean most bosses.Aside from staying super aggressive with bosses try to dodge into their attacks. Most of the time youre getting killed its probably because youre dodging away from the attack but since most bosses have such long sweeping attacks and combo like crazy youre just jumping into the next attack.Blood Starved Beast is a good example of what Im talking about. It has broad right handed strikes as do most bosses  its rare that a boss favors its left side. If you dodge to its left or straight back youll get hit no matter your timing and youll get staggered and hit again and again. Instead when it pulls back to strike dodge right at its hand. The brief immunity you get via dodging lets you dodge through it safely and now the BSB is stuck in its combo allowing you to spank it quite a few times. Even just simply circling around it to its right will keep you safe almost the entire fight.EDIT As far as Paarl goes the electric one just be stupid aggressive. Dont dodge at all. Just stand right under him and spam attacks. Paarl to me is honestly the easiest boss for me aside from the witches of Hemwick and very little finesse is needed to kill him. Underneath you totally immune save for an AoE attack that is survivable.,bloodborne,d1n9rad,1,t5_31k9i

7130259,0,t3_4d8bpl,Church Pick and... Church Pick. On a more serious note I think for Skill builds the Church Pick and Rakuyo can cover quite a bit of ground. Ran with these two for a long time before I got my other stats up and they did great.Church Pick normal  Fast and solid onehanded combos some thrust attacks if you need it etc.Church Pick transformed  Extra range all that thrust pretty fast for a twohanded weapon great moveset. Plus that R gt Follow Up R can be devastating. It also has some wonderful overhead smashes.And then theres the whole serrated and righteous bonuses plus the fact that you can buff it with anything. Beasts? Burn em up. Kin? Thrust into them with the power of lightning.Rakuyo normal  Lots of nice frontal jabs and slashes pretty fast and hits hard enough. I like to use it against NPC hunters and single targets.Rakuyo transformed  More spread to clear out mobs feels faster than the onehanded mode in terms of hits spin to win. I find it pretty fun for PvE.Again the Rakuyo can be buffed with whatever you wish. Its fun to go to Layer  of Isz and just boltspin the little Emissaries there.At the end of the day though it does depend on your playstyle and build. There are other combinations that can cover both speed and range. Not everyone likes the Pick and Rakuyo movesets for example haha. And damn those stupid sharks.,bloodborne,d1ompjw,2,t5_31k9i

From the way that the Hunters Nightmare works it pulls people specifically Hunters who have gone mad drunk on blood from the real world into this nightmare. And the only way we can get to it is after we kill her. So it wouldnt make sense? Right? Then again Laurence is a tricky character as his skull is on the Altar and we find him in the Nightmare. Not to mention there is strong evidence that suggests he is the BloodLetting Beast in the chalices. I also dont think that the are wearing the same outfit the one Amelia has when we fight her in a more tattered darker grey almost outfit and has an included blindfold which is not present when we see her in the Hunters Nightmare who is wearing the White Church Hunters Set. Also Im not  convinced she was a Hunter but just a high ranking official of the church much like Laurence  seemingly the current leader before we kill her anyway.

7158587,0,t3_4dk0jk,I dont know what youre talking about. Madmen are one of the best if not the best nonboss mob in this or any Souls game. A design full of character and really fun to fight especially in one of those small lever rooms with stairs pParrying them is not hard. They have a flurry kind of move where you dont even need to time the shot. But its not the only way. The double sickle version will often jump at you just dash out and attack. The corpse guy is the hardest but you can also hit him at the end of his combos or dodge through one of his slow swings. Do not dodge wildly time it to their attacks although that goes for the whole game really.They are weak to fire. If you hit them with a trap or make oil barrels explode close to them that will often oneshot them. In many places you can slink behind them for a backstab. They often pause between attacks and give you time to back off or heal. They are extremely fair enemies.,bloodborne,d1rv1eb,1,t5_31k9i
7158732,0,t1_d1ozlip,Interesting I honestly dont really understand the mechanic behind damage based staggering or in this case stunning on boss characters but that makes sense. However its just odd that Ive fought rom over  times and Im the only one whos locked him out of teleporting with the reiter. I suppose I worded the second part about the bullets poorly. Physical attack scales with skill therefor the bullets indirectly scale with skill. Im pretty sure other weapons that have a built in firearm however only scale with blood tinge. I could be totally wrong but I notice no difference in weapons such as the spears shot attack and I used that the first half of the game.I know the physical and attack  increase gems effect blood damage but I only use the reiter for both its normal move set and its bullet attack. Others just dont seem worthwhile. Except the bow but I primarily use that for shooting arrows do bt gems are more beneficial usually.,bloodborne,d1rvmpn,1,t5_31k9i

The DLC was exactly what i wanted except Lawrence he can piss off reusing an enemy but giving it all the health and massive elemental damage is nonsense though i got him eventually. I thought the difficulty was on point and Ludwig is my favourite boss in gaming outright. Thats not to say they werent difficult except the living failures but I literally know everything about Ludwig to the point i beat him at lvl  though i wont pretend that was my first run against him that was lvl  ish and had like thirty deaths and an hour and a half put in to it he was brutal. Maria was sort of Gehrman . so that was ok. The DLC is a real jump and takes more time to get used to. Seriously those Cthulu executioners are just trolling design at this point. However I think its generally what was wanted and expected more difficulty and more stuff. It recovered the fact the end game was too easy imho from about Rom onwards the bosses are gimmicky jokes really that excepting random one shots they can call down on a whim dont offer all that much albeit what they do offer in terms of design is cool af.,bloodborne,d1syk2y,1,t5_31k9i

7314753,0,t1_d28l6r5,I know where you are and no you really dont need to level up to be able to take those enemies on. The whole point of that area is to teach you how to manage large mobs. The game isnt even set up for you to be able to level up until you are done with that section. The cane is actually the hardest of the three starting weapons to begin with. However make sure you are using its transformed mode since it does extra serrated damage that way. If you are truly stuck look up a guide. Theres no shame there. There are shortcuts you can open to the first lamp in Central Yharnam once you get past the large group of enemies surrounding the fire and you may not be able to find them without a nudge in the right direction. Your other option is to reroll your character and start from square one. Where youre at it wouldnt mean having to trudge through large sections of game to get back to where you are. The Saw Cleaver or Hunters Axe may be a better weapon for you. The cleaver does serrated damage in its regular form and has a low stamina cost while the axe will allow you to regain more health from attacking and has a nice spinwin charged attack in its transformed mode.

When it comes to combat people will tell you that Dark Souls is slower you have to use a shield wait to attack etc. These arent exactly true. You can choose to use shields or not and this will change combat dramatically. See which you like better. I will say though that the enemies including bosses ARE actually slower than Bloodbornes and it honestly makes it easier.Dont expect weapons as amazing as Bloodborne. You will be severely disappointed. But I think you will like it because Dark Souls is a great game just remember Bloodborne is a more recent game from the developers so it is bound to have improved a lot. Dark Souls  is AMAZING.P.S. You will see a lot of people say DS is terrible. Some do really think this but the majority are those who cant let go of this kind of meme idea of the game.

If you have PS you can just search for chalice glyphs you have unlocked to create them for free rather than spending your materials each time you create a new one.Ask google where you can farm specific mats. For example off the top of my head kidnappers seem to have a decent rate of ritual blood drops. You can just kill an easily accessible one reload the area rinse and repeat rather than creating brand new dungeons to look for more.To go back to the dont bother with root chalices thing if you fully explore every room of every story chalice you probably shouldnt have to farm at all.,bloodborne,d2e2g03,1,t5_31k9i

Never get too greedy.A few more tips Wear armor with poison resistance Gascoigne or Black Church to make the final phase less annoying.

7632014,0,t1_d39i07w,When I did this I used the saw spear.  Also if you do decide to do this I have a couple of recommendations.   Go for the Sinister Lower Loran Root chalice.  Its easier to get than the Lower Loran Root chalice AND youll have an easier time running through it to get one of your own.   Dont spend echos from the chalice dungeons on level ups.  If you are doing this as early as possible right after Amygdala which you can do right after Amelia using the massive amount of echos you will receive on levels will leave you ridiculously over powered in the main game.  I instead recommend using the echos on bullets and vials and then consumables.   Do a chalice directly after BSB and Amelia.  Itll break up the monotony of the early dungeons.  Its really fun to do this btw.  Insanely hard but very fun and very rewarding.  ,bloodborne,d39pvps,1,t5_31k9i

7735019,0,t3_4l7uid,After playing Dark Souls III no. I mean Dark Souls III is one of the best games I have ever played make no mistake about that. But the world in DSIII has no sense of history to it like Miyazakis other games do. Dark Souls Demons Souls and Bloodborne all have this but DSIII does not since Dark Souls  IS the history. With no sense of history a lot of the feeling of mystery is also missing.So rather than giving the game a sense of history Dark Souls III has a sense of continuity and whilst thats great for a sequel because of this I truly feel like Miyazaki and his team are better off working on New IPs. Making a prequel to Bloodborne would remove all sense of history from it and a lot of the mystery would be lost IMO. Id still buy it though and likely enjoy the crap out of it Bloodborne is my favorite game ever made after all! But at the end of the day I guess Id prefer the mystery of the original game to be left in tact.,bloodborne,d3lf0f4,1,t5_31k9i
7735573,0,t1_d3lgopn,Maybe you just have a different view on what makes a good boss fight but in say Dark Souls  there are only like two or three boss fights that dont bore or irritate me to death. Most seem to be just lumbering big guys that telegraph their attacks for so long that theyre just checks to make sure you dont have blunt objects lodged in your skull and can hit the dodge button reliably. Meanwhile gimmick bosses aside Dark Souls  was largely filled with fastpaced big arena v boss fights which I personally hold as the greatest kind of boss fight hands down and the highlight of any game that employs them. Thats why Ornstein amp Smoug Artorias and Gwyn are really the only bosses in DS I actually like at all. DS also felt actually really inconsistent in its quality to me. Its all well and good until you get to Sens Fortress which is just a big raised middle finger to the player followed by the tightrope walks and archer gauntlets of Anor Londo. Then things get good again for a while until you get the Lordvessel whereupon the  Lord Soul areas compete for the title of which one makes you angriest. Like the halfbaked Lost Izalith concluding with the Bed of Chaos which kidney stones are preferable to. Then the frustrating gearcheck Four Kings where you just have to get lucky enough that they dont spam their massivedamage magic projectiles that track you for  literal seconds. Dukes Archives was too densely packed with hard hitting enemies and archerschannelers that made the early parts of it a bullet hell followed by crystal cave invisible floor nonsense and then the boss fight for real this time is an anticlimax where you dodge to his side and slash to win. Then theres the catacombs which is pretty much alright. Annoying at times but on the whole I liked it. Nito was an ass with his skeleton adds but the fight didnt take me very many attempts so on the whole I cant complain and you meet patches there who is always fun to kill on sight. But yeah taking each game on the whole BB and DS were far more qualityconsistent to me Id even rank DS for its polish bosses and the wonder of its contributions to lore as my favorite. DS is still a great time overall though Im definitely not gonna be replaying it anytime soon being spoiled with the mechanical improvements of BBDS.,bloodborne,d3lh9oa,3,t5_31k9i

I wasnt talking about that however.Demons Souls Dark Souls and Bloodborne are fantastic standalone games. There were never any sequels planned their story and message is selfcontaining and complete. Making a sequel to such a game is like sewing an extra limb on a person. It adds something but is it something of value?Id give up Dark Souls  and  any day for  new standalone fresh IP games. Dark Souls  had very little to do with Dark Souls  and Dark Souls  is a big bag of retcon and fanservice but other than that just a hollow sequel. Yes PVP is fun level design is mostly great gameplay is fun and everything but it does not really add anything of value to the already existing Dark Souls  lore.Dark Souls is about fire fades gt need to link gt kill big bosses gt link flame.

Youre probably going to be patient wait for openings and back off to heal.Dont. In Bloodborne its all about aggressiveness. Attacking hunting your enemy. There are even mechanics that encourage this  the Rally system. When you get hit you have a  second window to regain the health you lost by attacking the enemy. Certain Runes The Rings of the game improve the amount you Rally with each hit.With bosses it can sometimes be good to back off and heal  but more often than not youll find yourself waiting for an opening in their attacks. If you cant find an opening make one.Parry them  stagger them by attacking distract beasts with Pungent Blood Cocktails. Use your items to your advantage. Beasts are weak to fire so chuck a few molotov cocktails at them. Want to improve the damage? Throw an oil urn on them first. Some things are weak to bolt others to arcane.

Longer weapons tend to be better. Axe for str is great and the church pick for skill is also great. Also when he jumps at you dont dodge forward walk towards him. When he lands you can land charged r to his back fairly easily.Source Just beat him last week.Edit Easiest attack to parry is his overhand smash. As soon as his right leg lifts shoot him. Also when he uses his electricity attack run to the entrance of the fight. If you need help add me on PSN Emeica.

The fisherfolk worshipped Kos and some Byrgenwerth students found out about it Gehrmann amongst them with Maria his protege. They maybe took the Orphan of Kos with them the physical body not the one you fight. Maybe the orphan was already Long dead cant remember right now and experimented with its blood to let humans ascend to great one level. Lady Maria was a mother figure for all the testsubjects in the library hall. But at some point she cant take how inhumane these experiments are anymore so she commits suicide. After that Gehrmann presumably builds the doll after her likeness.After the library hall events chronologically you see what became of great people like Lawrence the first Vicar who thought he knew better than Willem and Ludwig probably the most famous of the church hunters.As for the Hunters NightmareThe Orphan much like Mergo is dead in the waking world but not in the nightmare realm. And for all the shit the old hunters did to Kos body and the Orphans? he cursed all the bloodadded hunters to live this nightmare for all of eternity. But since youre willingly going into the nightmare you can move past the loopstate and continue to the origins to stop this nightmare.

8193776,0,t3_4rff00,It took me  hours to get out of Central Yharnam on my first playthrough not counting boss attempts. And yeah that mob by the bonfire was a big part of that.It took me those  hours to learn these things Just because an enemy or more than one is there doesnt mean you need to fight it. Running past is equally valid and is my goto for one particular area later in the game since most enemies will just miss you and wont pursue very far. Dodge forward or sideways not back. Dodging backwards doesnt help you because now youre out of range too. If you jump forwards to behind the enemy theyll miss you because their attacks dont track usually and you can quickly finish them off. Some enemies are easier to kill with parryvisceral others are easier to kill by stunlocking others require more dodging and attacking when you can. Youll start to recognize which is which. Losing your echoes is actually not that big of a deal. Dont stress about it. There are plenty of great farming routes that can help you recover your losses in just a few minutes. Dying doesnt mean youre bad at the game it just means you havent quite figured out that enemys pattern yet. I was stuck on the first DLC boss for days then set the game aside for about a month. When I came back to it it took another few evenings and at first I was feeling fed up but then I noticed that I was starting to recognize the attack patterns and knew how to get out of the way. I got closer and closer and then beat it and I knew it was because Id finally figured it out. You learn.

8299583,0,t1_d5eyt4p,I dont think plate armour would help all that much in a fight. The lore of Bloodborne mentions that the reason Gehrman developed a style based around speed quick strikes and light clothing was because armour proved useless while exploring the Gods Labyrinths hence why the floors of the Chalice dungeons are littered with broken plate armour. Even the quickest armour in Dark Souls is fairly slow compared to the hunters who can get in and out in a flash doing tons of damage while theyre there.,bloodborne,d5f07y2,3,t5_31k9i

8604356,0,t3_4xlyi9,PvP questions. I believe the covenants only apply when youre matchmaking for cooperators as opposed to adversaries. Say if you were in the Executioners covenant and rang your small resonating bell theres a chance itll send you as an adversary to the world of someone in the Vileblood covenant instead of someones world as a helper. Im not  on this stuff as I really just use the covenant runes for their bonuses.. Like I said not  sure on this stuff. Maybe someone else can enlighten.. First is to find out if its an invasion or a duel. if the host is just running away its fair to say its an invasion and you can hunt them down any way you like. If its a duel gesture first and then try to not get hit while hitting them sometimes too. Sounds stupid but thats about what it is. Dodge timing attack timing spacing learning movesets takes practice.. You get a percentage of echoes based on their level. You also get an insight I believe.

Im not sure on the best fire gems though. I just got back to playing BB and decided to go again for physical. Felt like elemental damage was too complicated to calculate  farm. I just obliterated Ludwig last night with a physical weapon  fire paper.I put some fire gems I had picked up during some farming sessions on my Boom hammer but Ive yet to test it. Its almost purely fire damage now.,bloodborne,d6jvi3y,2,t5_31k9i

In the first phase he cant attack you so I suggest killing all the spiders so they dont attack you later. Then deal as much damage to him as possible you can hit him as he teleports. Then you can either go in to hit him or kill the spiders he spawns first. If you choose to attack the spiders the key point is to keep your camera on Rom so you can see what attack he is going to do.,bloodborne,d6pbdxs,1,t5_31k9i

So if you start swinging and something pokes you poise determines if you complete the attack or if you stagger back. Thats why if you ever watch DS videos specifically  amp  youll see people in heavy armor just tanking hits and pounding their assailant into the ground with their giant sword axe or hammer.With the Winter Lanterns they are incredibly difficult to stagger without fullcharge Rs or the KirkhammerStake DriverOther giant weapon.,bloodborne,d6to8dz,2,t5_31k9i

Plus Im pretty sure  they scale the enemies to strengthen up when theres more than one player. So anyone like that can fuck right off just play the game how you want and if you come across anyone like that just ignore them and move on.

8987466,0,t3_53df6g,The DLC is meant to kick you while you are down. Git gud. That being said I have been through it multiple times and with different characters. My Str build much similar to your build was the hardest one to get through. Weapons that are slow in the dlc seem to punish you. That being said you can grind those first hunters and the beats to level up. I usually dont start the DLC until Im level . I have helped tons of people who are lower level there and they are usually skillBT builds that rely on speed and dexterity than power moves. So my suggestion is either level up a bit and go from there or learn the mobs moveset and remain vigilant. Other people have mentioned doing CDs. I can confirm this is a good choice as well. Blood gems can really really change your weapon for the better. If you are going to grind to to level up this is a good way to do so. Good luck hunter.

9073100,0,t1_d82f22y,I know for a fact the Healing Church no longer cares about fearing the Old Blood.Listen to Amelias mantra  seek the Old Blood.Willem told him to fear it and disdained its use in any capacity. Whats the Healing Church about? Blood Healing.Willem was right to say Laurence was betraying him  Laurence had no intention of fearing the Old Blood. Evolution without courage will be the ruin of our race.I initially saw things your way  this being the Church taking a moderate road between abstinence and bloodorgy  but knowing Laurence was the first Cleric Beast knowing what Amelias words were knowing Laurences legacy and his intentions of using the blood? Beasts are just bad for PR so they outright ban everything to do with them.Then behind the scenes?Archibald granted with some amount of skepticism from those around him looked into the nature of Darkbeasts and developed Bolt as a method for Hunters to hunt.Yahargul is the area the School of Mensis works in. The School of Mensis is a part of the upper echelons of the Healing Church. A Yahargul hunter there has beast claws.Laurence was the first Cleric Beast and Clerics turn into the most terrifying beasts. Why do they turn into them? Theres three possibilities as I see itFirst Clerics use force of will think Gascoigne to delay their transformation turning into much more potent beasts when finally affected. This in my mind is unsatisfying. It explains it sure but its completely unfounded except for Gascoigne who certainly didnt turn into a Clerictype beast just a scary aggressive halfbeast. As we see with Amelia such transformations are nearinstantaneous.The only other argument in favor you could bring is Ludwig I think. Ludwig wasnt really a beast Im pretty much absolutely certain of this. Blooddrunk? Sure. Twisted by the Nightmare? Most certainly. But he was definitely no beast he has none of the identifying attributes. Further he had outside help so to speak so I dont count his as force of will offsetting the plague of beasts even if he was a beast and we have no reason at all to say that he was.So with  out what about ? Clerics get vastly more blood ministration than the average person. This makes sense  theyre the top of the Healing Church. It also makes no sense  that creates a massive drain on your upper echelon when fully half or more go crazy and eat the staff every hunt and need to be brutally murdered. It makes more sense that theyd actively keep their leadership away from blood ministration unless ... they were trying to do something special with it. The only thing the blood seems to do in the long run is turn people into beasts. It confers no special benefits by itself it simply cures disease and prolongs life and then turns the patient into a beast. Ergo anything they could possibly do with blood ministrations necessarily involves their leadership becoming beasts. Thats problematic for saying they hate beasts in more than a public imageserving sense.Well what about option three?Option three is skipping the middleman. The end result is beasthood and thats the secret. Beasthood diminishes with Insight and the upper echelon of the Healing Church has access to the Great Ones. If as is posed a couple times in the game see Beast Roar tool Beasthood is the inner nature of humanity then its possible the upper echelons are trying to become close to the Great Ones without losing their humanity. Theyre embracing the beast within them at the same time they try to become kin of the Cosmos hoping that this will keep them human. But the Great Ones arent easy to contact and Insight isnt easily acquired so they fall victim to the plague.With Option  Laurences path to evolution is walking a razor edge between the celestials and the beasts hoping that when the Great Ones come calling they have the beasthood to stay human  and hoping that the timing is right.No matter what you have to concede one of the following points either the Healing Church is incompetent to the point of stupidity letting something they know causes beasthood be given to their leadership the Healing Church is given to risktaking behavior and purposefully plays with beasthood or the Healing Church actively pursues greater notions of beasthood on the inside.Insipidly incompetent to the point of disbelief  every item description suggests the cause of the plague is well known to hunters and the church suicidally gambling with all of Yharnams population or out and out Beastworship.,bloodborne,d82ftzf,2,t5_31k9i

Trying to fight him without doing that makes the fight near impossible since youll inevitably use up at least half your vials doing so.Phase two is entirely reliant on patience. Stay just a quickstep away from him and wait for him to use a move with a lot of endlag the slam down being the big one to watch out for. Jump in get a few hits in and dodge out. He only really fights right up in your face or spams projectiles in phase two the only melee move he uses with a lot of range has quite a bit of windup and is comparatively easy to dodge.Phase two hes still got some parriable moves but he moves so chaotically that its near impossible to land them even if you time it right. I found it best to go blunderbuss for this fight if you want parries since its long reload time hardly matters given how fast hell close the gap on a missed parry regardless of phase but its wider spread makes it a lot more reliable in general.,bloodborne,d8db13e,1,t5_31k9i

Bloodborne is tense for sure and the atmosphere is very eerie and unnerving but there are only a few jump scares maybe two in the whole game and only a couple of scenes that are horrific. There are two zones that are genuinely frightening because of the music and atmosphere but generally speaking the fear and tension in Bloodborne comes from the sense that youre going to run into something that will kill you.

By their name it ties them to the group that the Healing Church sent to purge Cainhurst. You might be wondering but we dont see any of their corpses! Well we dont see any Pyramid head executioners corpses the closest is an armor set.I think they were there because you can see that the Cainhurst ghosts have been cleanly beheaded. You cant do that with a Wheel. An axe though yes yes you can.Now to explain the locations of the Executioners.The one executioner in Yharnam is to show that the Healing Church has a presence in Yharnam. It guards nothing its just patrolling a seemingly empty space. This is interesting because if you had this game when it was made originally you could jump all the way to the back of Iosefkas Clinic and then go to Forbidden Woods. Those two places are heavily linked to the Church.The next executioners can be seen in front of the chapel that leads to Yahargul. This is to protect the School of Mensis perhaps they enlisted these executioners to protect them? Maybe the Choir just didnt want anyone to enter the place thinking that it was blocked. Or it was just cordoned off they were patrolling the area to prevent anyone from entering so that they can try breaking down the door and entering. This is further implied by the placing of the snipers and Edgar Choir intelligence man in the Nightmare of Mensis.Executioners in Hemwick are there to prevent anyone from reentering Cainhurst.This doesnt explain the Hemwick witches in Yahargul but I have a theory.I think the Hemwick witches are actually just vigilante witches that go everywhere in search of eyes. They take the phrase What we need are more eyes and requirement of eyes pretty literally. I think the more eyes you have the stronger you are. The Witches can use arcane powers who else can? Brainsuckers! They are the embodiment of too much insight and yet the witches can use them.Why?Look at their clothing its lined with eyes. Thats why! Thats why they can summon Mad Ones and use arcane powers. They have sight. They constantly want more though as they like trying to scoop out eyes from anyone.We can see who has more eyes than others by just looking at whether the witches can use arcane. From memory only the Yahargul witches cant use arcane.,bloodborne,d8p18k2,5,t5_31k9i

The boy runs away his uncle takes over and is essentially a cruel dictator with the Hyenas at his command. Son almost dies of starvation is resuced by hippies and becomes vegetarian. Found by an old friend and taken back. Goes and kills his uncle and becomes the king.Its a pretty dark story for a six year old but yet its allowed.

For the charge always dodge to the side that doesnt have the secondary mouth otherwise youll likely get caught as his hitbox is larger on that side. The ceiling jump isnt actually hard to avoid all you have to do is sprint straight ahead and hope you dont run into a wall. Get hits when you can the best times in my experience are during the spin dodge through it and youll have free chances to attack after the shorter jump if he lands in front of you can get his head during the bite flurry dodge through one of them to get some hits the three slash combo again dodge through and the long duration spit you can dash through and then heal when you attack him.

9687255,0,t1_da73vw8,While I agree with everything you said I think us having multiple chances at the fights is purely gameplay. Once Gehrman is defeated he says The night was long... and doesnt come back which implies that simply dying in the dream is enough to sever the ties. Coupled with the theory that the MP is controlling Gehrman based on the neutral ending where you take his place he couldnt have accepted death as the MP wouldnt have allowed him to. I lean more towards this theory considering that Gehrman is in a wheelchair the entire time previous leading the hunters to believe or assume that he isnt combat worthy and poses no threat. This would allow the MP to take unwilling hunters by surprise without placing Gehrman at too much risk as he overwhelms his fellow. Granted that is built on the assumption that the MP isnt controlling him only physically but mentally as well  I.e. Not allowing him to accept death emotionally. If Gehrman still has the ability to desire and accept outcomes your theory would hold. Just because he doesnt physically accept death he mentally could and that would be enough to release him from his bondsI think it boils down to how much control the MP actually has over Gehrman but I dont think well ever have that information ,bloodborne,da75r0v,3,t5_31k9i

Not because you are a sorry undead who just cant die but because youre an immortal Hunter with the Mark etched into your Consciousness. And do you know what Hunters do? They HUNT! What do they Hunt? They Hunt BEASTS. So if you feel your spirit being crushed just go out and kill a few BEASTS its just what we do.But if you feel that Greatness is immanent drawing nigh to the Elect give some thought to the Hunt the Blood and the horrible Dream.Stop the spreading scourge of Beasts lest the night carry on forever.Our Eyes are yet to Open.,bloodborne,daduxmy,2,t5_31k9i

9748965,0,t1_daefbtm,gtEnding  is the best ending for you because you are cured of whatever plagued you in the first place and are now free to go wherever you want in the world. Ending  is the best ending for everyone because they are free of the moons curse.I agree with this. I view the endings as a choice between saving yourself and sacrificing yourself with the second ending being basically just a trap sentencing yourself to great suffering at no benefit to the world.The point where I depart from your view and most other peoples views is that I dont think turning into a Great One is necessarily good. To put it in a more general sense I dont think the Great Ones are good. I can see why everybody assumes that because the game outright states their greatness quite a lot calling it a blessing and all that. But the fact that GreatOneworship is laid on so thick by the game is the reason one note in particular stood out to me. The one in the Lecture Hall its even slightly hidden that mysteriously just says Hunt the Great Ones. Hunt the Great Ones. Its such a stark contrast to the positive light all the rest of the lore puts them in.And on similar grounds the game goes to great pains to paint beasts as horrible awful creatures. And that makes Gehrmans early statement that you should just hunt some beasts and not think about it really suspicious to me. If beasts are so horrid and cleansing the streets of them is so good why does he tell you not to think about it? Gehrman while under the influence of the Moon Presence tells us to kill beasts and not think about why and then later tells us to kill ourselves Gehrman of his own free will tells us to kill him in order to end his suffering. If theres anything in the game that I think should NOT be trusted it is the things Gehrman says while he is awake and under the Moon Presences control.There is explicit lore describing beastliness as an inherent trait of humans and the Great Ones as inherently inhuman. Theres a pattern in the Souls series relating to this. On the surface level theres this presentation like humans are weak and that they live in the shadow of these allpowerful creatures but thats a deception. Demons Souls tells you that the power is beyond human imagination but as you progress the bosses become more human not less until the deadliest boss of all has the form of a human. Dark Souls starts with this incredible imagery of a Gwyn hurling thunder at immortal dragons but hes ultimately helpless before unstoppable dark souls aka humanity and the greatest threat to the world is a human growing uncontrollably. And to get back to Bloodborne the two most dangerous bosses are Logarius and Gehrman both human. Two of the bosses in the DLC are humansturnedbeast one is still human and the Orphan of Kos is humanoid the Orphan and humanity discussion is a whole other can of worms. Mergo is nominally the central character but in reality Mergo is only present because of the scheming of the cult of Mensis and the real antagonist of the story is Micolash a human. The final opponent of the game the Moon Presence would seem to almost be over and above even the other Great Ones but in combat the Moon Presence is little more than a beast. Its only outstanding trait is an ability to CONTROL HUMANS. Humans those creatures that are so powerful theyre able to hunt and kill Great Ones in physical combat.,bloodborne,daertlg,1,t5_31k9i
9753214,0,t3_5euu0a,This may be able to help if you dont mind a general walkthroughUse the Old Hunters Bell to summon Father G for the Cleric Beast fight. Hell draw most of the attacks leaving you free to attack from the rear.

The Music Box can help but nothing replaces the visceral attacks.

9785149,0,t1_daj73bb,Exactly. The feat that we are given the opportunity to complete is very special. And all achieved by ruthlessly murdering a bunch of stuff. There could be other ways to ascend of course something definitely happened to Rom. But Rom is Kin and not a true Great One. And Im not sure of any other way that we could ascend or if there would be any purpose including such unknowns in a point about the lore. Something that you said just struck me we consume the cords that give us the eyes to ascend. But youre correct we only are able beat the Moon Presence by the use of blood echoes. Laurence and Willem were both right. We needed Blood and Eyes to ascend. Maybe slightly off topic but it seems those who consume blood turn to beasts and those who gain eyes turn to kin. Great ones are neither and as you pointed out to ascend we must consume both. ,bloodborne,daj8e3t,6,t5_31k9i

9803043,0,t3_5fmodr,I think Nightmare Slain indicates that you have ended a Nightmare. The Nightmare Realms seem to exist without necessarily having an active Nightmare hosted by a Great One like the Nightmare Frontier but it seems that sometimes a contact between a human and a Great One leads to the creation of a particular Nightmare. We know of three such Nightmares  the Nightmare of Mensis the Hunters Nightmare and the Hunters Dream. The last one is called a Dream but it seems its the same underneath. You can also make a case that each one has a human host  Micolash probably Maria and Gehrman. So I think the Nightmare Slain message is associated not just with killing a Great One but ending such a Nightmare. I note also that it actually says Prey Slaughtered when you defeat Orphan and Nightmare Slain when you destroy the shadow of the Orphan coming out of Kos.As for say Ebrietas Augur of Ebrietas reads Use phantasms the invertebrates known to be augurs of the Great Ones to partially summon abandoned Ebrietas. Choir Garb discussing the Choir ...Together with the left behind Great One they look to the skies in search of astral signs....

9968157,0,t3_5ibgb7,A lot of people will tell you Dark Souls  is the worst entry in the series I couldnt disagree more but I guess thats not the point. The atmosphere is going to be very different not quite as pervasively dark and depressing though sometimes that makes the dark areas that much more effective. Dark Souls is also in a more typical fantasy setting by which I mean there are knights and wizards and dragons etc you still have minimal interaction with people who dont want to kill you though. Difficulty wise Id say theyre all pretty comparable youll just take some time to get used to the slower pace of pretty much everything. Story presentation is also very similar you still have to piece together whatever is going on entirely on your own. You will also have to deal with more mechanics probably the most significant being equipment weight and poise. Basically the heavier your gear the slower your roll becomes. And higher poise means youre harder to stagger. Bloodborne is kind of like someone took a Dark Souls game simplified some of its more obtuse elementsfor better or worse is up to opinion and turned it into more of an action game.Also yes Scholar of the First Sin is the complete edition of the game.,bloodborne,db6vl7f,0,t5_31k9i

Off the top of my head Saif untricked has amazing stun and crowd control and the L can be used to finish off a straggler after hitting a group with the wide Rs of untricked and if the L doesnt kill the straggler the new tricked move set excels at v. Boomhammer charged R can cheese any knockeable enemy extremely hard the wide deceptively fast r swings and hyper armor give it great crowd control especially with its high damage and once again L should make quick work of a straggler with its quick startup fire damage and heavy stun.Yet those weapons are at the very bottom.

When youre close to then you can hear frequencies constantly sounding.  The theory was that this was how some great ones could communicate with the humans.  Sound is also used in some attacks such as Beast Roar and Ebrietas eerie sound wave that inflicts frenzy.So perhaps the particular resonance we hear while near a lamp is one that is attuned to the dream too and so gives us a means to go there by focusing on it.  This would explain why we cant warp from lamp to lamp.As for the lamp design itself it simply fits in with setting.,bloodborne,dbisgdn,18,t5_31k9i

10161644,0,t1_dbv4h9g,Yeah they can get a bit complex but the ones youve got available to you at this point are likely just physical attack  up gems which is what you want.The trick with gems is that they only fit in the same shaped slot i.e.  radials fit in the radial slots triangles in the triangle etc. Your weapon will have  radials and a waning right now you can find different versions of the same weapon later on with different gem slots so you might only be able to fill those radials as wanings are harder to come by early on.Also you need to upgrade your weapon to open up all of the slots  I think  will give you access to all of them. At some point youll find a droplet shaped gem which can fit it any slot. Thats probably your best bet for now for that waning slot.And finally this assumes that youve beaten the Witch boss in Hemwick Lanespoiler as there is an item after defeating her that is required to insert the gems into your weapons.,bloodborne,dbvvn94,1,t5_31k9i

Its base damage will convert to that type and STRSKL scaling is replaced by ARC scaling. So you want the base requirements for STRSKL eg  for Whirligig and then  arcane for damage scaling.I recommend a  STR  SKL  ARC build since it lets you use almost any weapon converted to elemental damage as well as using Wheel Moonlight Sword and Tonitrus to thier near maximum potential. ,bloodborne,dbxw3sd,2,t5_31k9i

That player then gets hit no matter what except that during rolls in addition to not having a hurtbox which is enough to make you invulnerable in PvE but not in PvP youre invulnerable to damage and hitstun.  So the player cant take damage but the stagger from the charged R is probably not classified by the game as a form of hitstun and thus they are not immune to being put into a visceral state during their iframes.Basically the same as how lagstabs work in the Souls games.,bloodborne,dc3n3fy,2,t5_31k9i

Once the blood moon happens all of them die as the bodies they carry are brought to life. The mummified corpses of the college do look old yes but they did not simply die they were sucked into the nightmare. Being drained and having your brain leave you might indeed leave humans in a mummified state. It is true everything looks decrepit but not necessarily old if the ritual drained the life of the college and transformed every one into stone who is to say it did not also affect the scenery of the town? gtI think the Ritual is something ongoing since they used the third umbilical cord to make contact with mergo which formed the nightmareThe ritual is on going until you kill Micolash because he did not create the nightmare he hosted it. That is why he is the sole survivor and the rest formed into the brain. They aspired to create a great one or all become great ones which might be more likely in order to be on the same level as Mergo. The brain is different it is indeed a great one the only true artificial great one there is. Rom was simply kin. Moving to Rom whatever her original purpose was she now blocks the blood moon from happening. It is not simply a cloak because we can see the Amygdala once we have enough insight. Killing Rom before we have that gives us insight as well if not literal currency insight. The blood moon does move it has moved from a lot of places. It was once in the land of the Pthumerians then the land of Loran then old Yharnam. It might be where the Moon Pressence has the most influence or which place has the highest possibility for the blood plague. ,bloodborne,dcf4aau,1,t5_31k9i

10333464,0,t3_5nrvtn,There are a few things that sway this argument in both directions. On one hand we have the chosen undeadashen one who has a much more vast arsenal but the hunter has a much more powerful set. No matter what anyone says a shield will not stop a cannon ball but at the same time I cant see the hunters leather armour stopping a sunlight spear or a crystal souls spear.Hunter   Undead So lets remove both of the range options and target healing. The hunter has more option for healing purely through more vials and the ability to steal health back so thats one for the Hunter.Hunter   Undead Now we get to the more nitty gritty details the advantages of both. We can argue that the Chosen UndeadAshen one is much stonger but the Hunter is much much faster. This offers up an interesting dilemma as even though the hunter is faster the reduced arsenal hinders them. I can see a way without the use of the cannon for the hunter to win in a straight v fight.Hunter   Undead As we are at a tie lets brings in each characters world and the enemies within. As we only have one Bloodborne game and three in the Dark Souls series purely for fairness lets just use one the original dark souls.Both games lead you to fight enemies that you are strong against dark souls  making you fight enemies that are best to fight head on and bloodborne letting you use the best of your mobility. This is a very difficult one but I have to give it to the undead here. The vast amount of sheer monstrous enemies in dark souls  tips it towards them monsters ranging from massive dragons enemies as mobile as the hunter and multiple beings close to gods just gives the undead the advantage.Hunter   Undead ,bloodborne,dcfctca,1,t5_31k9i

And also gained by killing bosses.There are also items called Madmans Knowledge that you can use to increase insight.Insight has a number of uses but also carries some disadvantages.First  The first point allows interaction with the doll to allow spending echoes to level up.Once you have talked to her once you can safely return to the dream at  insight and even though she isnt standing you can use her services to level upSecond  It acts as a currency. There is a bath messenger just outside the house which allows you to buy specific items which may not be available on the one below.These are the uses of it.Other things involve unlocking specific world changes at specific insight numbers Disadvantages are that higher insight is supposed to make the game harder in certain ways.

Very few areas have them by default while most of the time they spawn because the host has a cooperator or they themselves are trying to invade.Invasions therefore can often lead to getting ganked.Said enemy can be killed to prevent being invaded but still enables you to invade. Reloading the area and meeting the above conditions will respawn it.The boss also needs to be alive for a player to be invaded or to get summons just like Grim Spirits The First.Two late game areas that have the enemy by default are popular invasion spots as the risk of getting ganked is reduced.Players under Lv cant be invaded.,bloodborne,dd3d8mx,1,t5_31k9i

Its probably my least favorite game in the series and I honestly feel like what it had been trying to do had already been done semisuccessfully in DS.  So its lack of originality and the fact it draws heavily on the mechanics and lore of other games in the series makes it a disappointment for me.

And I also almost feel that Kin could have fallen under Psychictype as well though making it a new type does seem the better call thematically.Micolash needs a condition to his effect.  As it is now it seems kinda vague lol.  Just a when this card is summoned or something.Rom should specify it summons tokens since you didnt make a basic monster for the little spiders.Purely for usability on Childhoods Beginnings Id add the ability to banish the Umbilical Cords from the grave or your hand.  Or if you wanted to keep it a little more difficult to use but still thematically correct make it so you banish them ONLY from the grave to reflect how the hunter has to actually use the cords before the MP will appear.Transform Weapon should just say Hunter rather than Hunter of Beasts to match up with the sets new type name.I would also add something to Laurence where if its destroyed and sent to the graveyard then it is immediately special summoned back to the field but with reduced ATK and  DEF.

I hated getting one shot on cursed watchdogs charge attack when his back foot just BARELY scratched me.Instability damage on the whole I dont have an issue with. They might want to rework how its calculated though. The attack rating goes up by  which doesnt necessarily mean damage goes up by .  increase in damage would seem fair w multiple hitboxes. Loran darkbeasts aoe ends up dealing what feels like  more damage depends on BL while running so I typically end up doing what you do sitting there to just tank it before healing.

10903642,0,t1_de3u1g6,They act more like dogs and they look more like dogs albeit really fucked up ones. Maybe they are human victims of the scourge but the simplest answer is often the most correct one and there just really isnt enough suggesting that they arent just a breed of dog with swords taped to it. Hunting dogs are considered beasts for the purpose of game mechanics but that applies to all the dogs crows and the pigs all of which seem to have contracted the scourge by eating the flesh of the dead no differently from the Madaras Twins snake. They are not though considered grossly transformed beasts which scourge beasts and the less developed beast patients in Old Yharnam are.They arent mindless. They can fear something beasts possess a natural fear of flame and some of the ones in the Hunters Nightmare will cower in fear of you even without you holding a torch. But there is still no sign of any beasts being tamed. They did it with magic isnt a good enough answer because arcane is not a universal solution it seems to do a very small amount of things.It is possible that multiple hunters can act in the same hunt but we at least appear to be alone on our hunt and I cant imagine more than a couple ever being tied to the dream at once. I think that writing it off as they made the area and then filled it with gravestones quite misses the point. There are that many headstones whether they were planned beforehand or added after. It is canonical and is the information we have to work with. The Hunters Dream has lasted longer than Gehrmans abandoned old workshop but also is based upon it. Dreams and nightmare realms seem to be able to change with time unless you think Kos died was desicrated did nothing for decades and then finally decided to create the Hunters Nightmare as vengeance after the burning of Old Yharnam. I can only assume that before Gehrmans time it took another shape and probably had another entity filling the role of the doll. When Laurence and his associates beckoned the nameless moon presence its form was altered to reflect the place that contact was made.I dont think it makes sense that people would try and beckon for a nameless Great One that appears to be a church secret on a regular enough basis to account for all of the references to other hunts. Also the moon presence descending so often would result in far too many births of Great One children it would be a regular event which it clearly isnt. You dont get multiple degrees of beckoned moon presence it just doesnt work that way logically. You have dont beckon beckon and be ignored or beckon and have the blood moon answer two of those have the same outcome and the other one is fullstop it is happening bad times all around. The blood moon excites the blood and induces frenzy. The former leads to the great concentration of beasts the latter to the changes in the people we encounter. No effect on the arcane seems to be noticible.I would even hazard to say the Mensis ritual doesnt involve a Great One being born just communing with a Great One who isnt born. But it is confirmed that the blood moon descending means that a womb will be blessed with the child of a Great One it is just a constant like how Great Ones will always lose their children.,bloodborne,de4mswe,1,t5_31k9i

11169405,0,t3_5zfpzq,LOVE this boss fight! everything about it is amazing. The edgy introduction as you walk into the cathedral and see a innocent looking woman in white praying at a alter... friend? nope she fucking explodes into a giant beast! then the music kicks in and the intense screaming and rabid movesets. Fighting her for the first time everything is so intimidating I bet there aint many Hunters who went in blind and one shot her. obvs there are some gods among us who did it with their bare hands lol! But she does have a lot of opening that let you get in some attacks especially on her limbs and it teaches you to rely on your quickness to get into position to weaken and damage limbs for viscerals either by keeping some space and baiting and avoiding the big forearm smashes or being aggressive and ducking under her faster attacks up close! Perfect for an early boss and when you get good enough to beat her it sets you up for reading some of the more tougher bosses later in the game.If you really want some fun on your next run head back to the lamp in central yarmham after getting to the cathedral ward and get a free flamesprayer from Gilbert! level it up as much as you can and then use a oil urn and her some bone marrow ash and burn her alive! as long as you hold shoot the buff from the ash applied to all attacks and you can seriously melt her quick! so much fun especially for helping fellow hunters in coop,bloodborne,dey1gll,2,t5_31k9i

In Dark Souls the thing I miss most is the bit of health regen you get when you put in a hit within a time frame after you get hit.

11256713,0,t3_60l43q,If we want to set the bar for easy Platinums Im pretty sure Horizon Zero Dawn was the easiest platinum I ever got.At least Bloodborne has the fact that it is a hard relatively speaking game so average players will not platinum it. Many other games hide their platinums behind those trivial kill  million enemies style achievements because the game is specifically not hard.I also feel like Bloodborne and Dark Souls to an extent instill a sense of challenger in the player. The game is hard from square one. The people who want to play the game have to really rise up unless youre just a FromSoft game veteran in which case its another notch on the belt really. Given that most people who buy a game have a desire to get their moneys worth out of it you have an above average number of people having to git gud. But once you start rising to the challenge you certainly cant just stop at the first playthrough. Now each achievement is another challenge the game presents to you and certainly the vaunted Platinum is the penultimate challenge. So youve got an above average number of players getting the platinum because this is the kind of game that makes you want the platinum.,bloodborne,df7xjhr,2,t5_31k9i

You failed to gain enough insight to resist the moon prescense or to resist against Gerhman when he offered to kill you. So now you wake up after the hunt has ended forgetting everything and as ingnorant as you were in the beginning and you cant do anything about the upcoming hunt or the great ones for that matter. How often does the hunt happen?Basically when the great ones feel like mating. The whole peopleturningintobeasts thing is a effect of great ones trying to make babies. Is the beast scourge the result of fishing gamlet villagers curse?No. The result of their curse is the hunters nightmare where blood drunk hunters are trapped and are forced to partake in a perpetual hunt.,bloodborne,df80yrg,4,t5_31k9i

Pay close attention to what hes doing and dont dodge prematurely. Dodging towards him also works when he leaps at you.And only heal when you know you can get away with it. After he finishes a combo is often a good time. The temptation is to heal immediately whenever you take damage and bosses will frequently punish you for this. After a combo is often a good time to attack him too but dont get greedy. Always be ready to dodge when hes winding up for his next attack.You can do it Hunter!

Where do you get off judging ones experiences without even knowing them? Is it alright if I assume negative things of you and act on those negative thoughts every time you speak or do anything? Personally I dont think its fair to assume the worst out of a guy just because they dont see eye to eye with x other group of people disparaging them.And No they dont need to pass anything nor does the guy need to change. All I did was state my opinion whether he cares for it or not is irrelevant. What Im shocked by is how much you guys seem to care about the fact that I dont pity him based on how he treats others. Half of you have made rash generalizations of me with nothing to back up claims and on top of that even claimed I think the opposite of what I said to begin with.I would be more than happy to debate anyone on this but it seems no one here wants to actually debate just make false claims and assuming the worst out of anyone who thinks mansplaining is in fact a sexist term.

11688298,0,t1_dgkvory,Parrying is mostly optional but so rewarding when you get the hang of it. You should not focus on being agressive more than being defensive at the same time. Bloodbornes combat quickly boils down to a very unique dance with the enemy one which mixes dodging and attacking and constantly learning how much of each should be used in every situation. It may sound complicated but it will slowly become natural. Dodge and slice and slice and dodge and open a window for a charged attack. The more you fight the more you realize that you can make enemies that constantly beat you down your bitches and not take a single hit from trolls and executioners. And it is so so rewarding.,bloodborne,dgkvx3e,2,t5_31k9i

11732334,0,t3_67dgi5,It could be a dream in the same way that we visit the dreamscapes of Nightmare Frontier the Nightmare of Mensis etc. As far as we are aware when we travel to these dreamscapes we do so physically as in our bodies travel with us but there are certainly other characters we meet whose consciousness leave their physical bodies behind. For instance it is implied that we travel to The Nightmare of Mensis through Micolashs corporeal corpse. The fevered blood dream could be one that our consciousness not physical self really does experience. I think that there is enough ambiguity from the introduction and language of the Blood Minister to assume that From were at least aware that this was a possible interpretation of the story.

11797796,0,t1_dgx8tss,Thanks! I feel like the ending of DS proved that many things are the way they are just because and that some characters are little more than names with no real weight on the story and that we were never supposed to meet them in person.Father Lloyd and Velka are no different from Irreverent Izzy or Oedon... they only provide fancy background for cool items but its not like the Suspicious Beggars real identity is Izzy or anything like that.Yes there are some cases in which we actually get to meet the heroes and villains we read about Artorias Ludwig the Nameless King Gwyn himself etc but most of the time the game keeps throwing new characters and factions at us instead of allowing us to meet or find more about those we already know about. Filianore is a perfect example of this. She was never mentioned before and there she is a central part of the last DLC. Same thing goes for guys like the Millwood Knights the Oto Workshop etc etc. The reason why I find BBs lore much more compelling and cohesive is that the DLC actually answered BIG questions instead of raising tons of new ones. Yes the specifics of what happened in Fishing Hamlet are still a bit obscure but what the Hunters and the scholars did there is blatant. So yeah my point is that many aspects of the lore were never meant to be explored and explained in the games. Lets just make the best of it and have fun with our creativity D,bloodborne,dgxbjtf,2,t5_31k9i
