9737682,0,t3_5elhca,Few extra things to note We are going to start requiring Discord and as such the link will be handed out as soon as you are all done with the process and you are expected to join. This serves as a way for you to both know important details and events as well as giving us a way to contact you in the case of inactivity so you arent just blindly kicked.  Activity requirements are going to a tad bit more strict.  days inactive gets a warning of some sort through Discord. This is your opportunity to tell us why you arent playing. At  days if you havent sent us a reply or if we dont think youre reply is a good enough reason we will let you know and you will be removed from the guild. If you do not have Discord you will be kicked at  days regardless. I understand that this may seem really strict but since the guild has gotten significantly larger the unfortunate trade off is that there is more of an appeal to people to get in and play and we want the most active and friendliest for this guild.  Guild games will be a weekly thing now! As the guild is much larger now it really helps with inter guild relations. Its encouraged that everyone participate at least once and there are always people in the guild looking to form teams that you can join yourself! ,Vaingloryguildhall,daddra6,1,t5_36drs
