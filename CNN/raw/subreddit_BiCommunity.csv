6593175,0,t3_45x1sw,I think coming out is really important but I know it holds different weight for different people. The first person I ever told was my mom and I was met with a well I hope thats not your life. But ever since then shes become so much more accepting. I never formally came out to my friends as we were all trying to figure out our sexualities in high school but we do talk about LGBT issues often as were all on the not straight spectrum. I think coming out just gets easier as you go and the words feel more and more comfortable in your mouth. The only person I havent told is my dads superreligious family but Im not at a place in my life where I am able to risk those relationships.,BiCommunity,d01ae8m,2,t5_3cgfk
