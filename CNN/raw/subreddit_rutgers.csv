Make sure to also introduce yourself to people your sitting around in class. It will take some time but if you put in the work youll definitely get there.

7350017,0,t3_4fz8ae,Heres an updated statement from usgtThe Daily Targum recently conducted a referendum asking students to agree to keep its fee on term bills a procedure that has been required in order to receive student funding since the newspaper became independent from the University in . The official results of that referendum have not yet been released to The Daily Targum.gtWe are aware of an article stating that we lost referendum. We were not contacted by the author or publication and have no knowledge of where the writer obtained the information. Once the Universitys Oversight Committee releases the results we will share them with the public.gtWe would however like to note that The Daily Targum has been unsuccessful in securing enough votes to win schools on campus in the past. While the loss of those schools created a financial hardship the paper has operated continually as a daily studentrun organization for the past  years. We are committed to serving the Rutgers community and have no intention of ceasing publication.,rutgers,d2dnaj2,19,t5_2risk

If this occurred on campus it would be reported even though no one involved is Rutgersaffiliated.Ive also learned that an Emergency Alert and Crime Alert are different things. Imagine someone threatened someone with a gun in an oncampus parking lot. If this was reported immediately then the threat still remains and an Emergency Alert will be made. If it was not reported until after the threat is gone then only a Crime Alert will be issued. Additionally many Clery Actreportable crimes such as weapon posession dont have to be reported at all if there was never a threat even if it was on campus.Edit The question still remains why they bothered to issue a crime alert for the same intersection a week or two ago for a less violent incident even though no one affiliated was involved,rutgers,d9p4638,14,t5_2risk

9594821,0,t3_5ce6zx,First talk to the professor. If you have a good reason for missing class and if theyre lenient theres a chance they could override it. Otherwise just take it again next semesterbefore you graduate. Retaking a class you failed will replace the F with whatever you receive the second time around. In the grand scheme of things failing one class is not that big of a deal. I believe most majors will allow  F before kicking you out. If you get back on track and deal with whatever caused you to skip out on class youll be fine. I know because I was in a similar situation failed an easy class I was getting an A in because I prioritized my much harder classes that semester.

10058804,0,t3_5jsppe,Depends on your course load and how quickly you learn. If youre the type of student than can learn well in class and doesnt need too much extra time outside of it to reinforce the material then youll have more time. If you need to put in the extra effort then youll have less free time or youll take the hit and do worse in class.Overall youre gonna spend a lot less time actually in class than you did in high school but most classes are going to require you to learn on your own as well. Its up to you to determine what you priorities and goals are and how much time you need to put in. Some people are just naturally good at learning material and can get by with not as much effort with decent grades. Others need to put in a lot more effort.Overall I wouldnt say college for most people is super stressful. Sure the final exam period can be very hectic as you need to know a lot of material in a short period of time but throughout the semester you may find yourself with more free time than you are used to. All depends on how well you want to do in classes and how great you are at learning knew material. ,rutgers,dbioq1r,2,t5_2risk

And most of all get the fast pass. Theres always a line to attend which can span  hours wait time. To get a fast pass attend an X number of events they host prior to the career fair so you can skip the line really helpful.Make  copies of your resume get a good suitprofessional attire and practice a  second pitch about your experience and what youre looking for.Im RBS so I cant say I have comp sci experience but a lot of companies look for CS I would say nearly  of them.Best of luck. day  and day  companies will differ so make sure to check the list before hand and choose the companies you want to target its packed alwaysMost companies will tell you to apply online on their site of CareerKnight but the key is to make an impression get their card and then a couple of days after the career fair email them and say thanks for all the info etc etc and how youve applied.

10396554,0,t3_5otfc7,I did a study group my first semester for my physics class and found it really useful. Its sort of like a recitation but its more focused on what the students in the study group are struggling with rather than the required material for the week. I also found that the other students were more likely to be motivated to participate since you have to sign up and give up more of your time to attend. Because the other students are seemingly more motivated its easier to talk to them about the class and work with them. But your experience may vary. I found that going to the recitation forces me to work an extra hour a week on the course material and in the end it really paid off for me.Full disclosure I am now a study group leader. My fellow study group leaders and I are really just trying to help you guys out as much as we can but have the extra advantage of not grading anything you do. This takes the pressure off us and you guys as students and lets us focus on helping you guys learn. Meaning we want people to come to our sessions because we want to teach them stuff.As far as semantics I believe that you will have to sign up online in the near future. Once you sign up the learning center asks that you commit to the sessions. Basically this means that if you miss a couple sessions  I think like  or  you will be dropped so that someone on the waiting list can take your spot. So basically attendance is mandatory but just so that people dont sign up and never come and then the study group leader doesnt go and sit in the classroom by themselves for an hour. But other than being dropped I dont think theres any other penalty.As a student a highly recommend the study groups if you have the time because I have had good experiences with them.As a study group leader I also highly recommend them but for more biased reasons.,rutgers,dcmikrl,2,t5_2risk

11021584,0,t1_deh8lxz,Disagree somewhat. I dont have experience with employers but I got asked in one of my medschool interviews during my application cycle many moons ago why did you opt to complete a BA in cell biology instead of a more rigorous BSc as they were confuseddid not fully understand how things are structured at Rutgers. Im aware it shouldnt matterthey should have known better that anyone with indepth knowledge of Rutgers knows it isnt even a choice that its all kinda the same anyway etc. This doesnt change the fact that I was asked and it did matter since human biases especially in science fields are a thing. It kinda sucks to be honest.As to why I dont know. Cornell only offers BAs this is the only other school I know offhand that does but everyone knows Cornell does this. With Rutgers it gets very muddy since it isnt a blanket BA only policy and theres no consistency about what gives you a BSc vs BA. Like OP mentioned exercise science and public health are awarded as BScs physics and compsci give you the option to do either and if im remembering correctly every other science major is BA only. If your employers or gradmedschool interviewers arent aware of the intricacies of how Rutgers works theyre not going to know any of this either.,rutgers,deh9lfh,4,t5_2risk

11191490,0,t3_5zqbre,General Chemistry doesnt have much curve to begin with as they already provide you several ways to improve your grades Replacement grade. If you got a better grade on a portion of the final exam that corresponds to Exam  Your hourly exam grade gets replaced. Only  of them however For example you got a  for exam  but you got  for exam  portion of the final exam. Your exam  grade will be recorded as . ACS. They used to completely replace your final exam grade with ACS score if you did better in ACS. However starting last year they instead make an average of ACS score and final exam grade. Only if you did better in ACS For example lets say you got  for ACS and  for final exam. Your final exam grade will be recorded as .Basically they give you  chances to improve your grade by possible an entire letter grade or more. Not much reason to curve generously.My point is you should not be relying on curve especially for General Chemistry.As a general rule curves will only get smaller as you get to higher level courses. Make it a habit not to rely on curve.,rutgers,df0jj1i,2,t5_2risk
