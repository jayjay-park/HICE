3081024,0,t3_2vg7hi,Im not positive about this because thats pointillism but you could try image trace in Illustrator and then import the file into Rhino. edit Did a quick test and it looks okay but will need a lot of cleanup depending on how youre using it.,rhino,cohcgz0,5,t5_2r38j

7246635,0,t1_d202lmc,gt is there a reason why you are doing this if all you want is d collision?gt In concept Im trying to do circle packing with a fixed set of geometry with a fixed set of tensile linkages. If youre familiar with force direct diagramming that is more specifically my intent. In practice I have a set of circles connected by tensile members clamp length Kangaroo  components originating from the centers of my packed circles or what ever. The issues I have arethe clamp length tensile members are not remaining associated with the geometries when the solver is running.The polys when they collide with the tensile members deform when it is better that they remain mostly rigid.I have tried Constructing the circles using the same points as i did to construct the tens members.Using the actual end points of the lines to construct the circles.,rhino,d21w2vc,1,t5_2r38j
7416623,0,t3_4gv6dv,There are definitely easier ways to do this in grasshopper and I suggest rather than trying to boolean out boxes you make a box full of boxes and then random reduce. The key here is to test if boxes are touching each other and if they are to choose the largest group. I can help you out by writing the script if you need any further assistance.Edit or to be even more accurate you could make the boxes significantly smaller a xx grid box vs a xx grid box and then actually create random rectangular prisms intersect it where you could test volume inclusion. The only downside is this process will most likely crash your computer unless you have gb or more of RAM.,rhino,d2l8032,2,t5_2r38j
