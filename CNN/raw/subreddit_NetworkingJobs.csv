3394739,0,t1_cpevr4o,CALO is a rotational program unless something has changed recently  as long as thats still the case theyll be looking for folks yearround on a rolling basis.  I dont know how competitive it is at the moment but my memory was that rotation positions would sometimes be available  months ahead of the start date while other years rotation roles could fill up  months ahead of the start date.  Definitely connect with them and talk options  its not the end of the world if you can jump on a later rotation ,NetworkingJobs,cpf86lb,1,t5_2tvyy
5346418,0,t3_3o6eto,Im  have a CCNA TS and I make like k  benefits. Im still working on my year degree which will open more doors but from most IT people I know you shouldnt expect more than K starting unless youre experienced in security or have an CCNPCCIE.I have a former lieutenant who works in DC now making K a year but he left IT to work in an intelligence cell for some contractor. Were you in intel? If yes pursue that if you want a higher starting salary.,NetworkingJobs,cvv2cv8,1,t5_2tvyy

10776714,0,t3_5u2lyg,You want a senior network engineerarchitect in downtown LA who has relevant experience designing implementing and operating every kind of network and all network technologies spanning everything from campus LANs to datacenters?  And you think you can get that in a buttinseat hire for k? You must not have hired anyone in that market in the last decade.  You need to at least double that number to get to the low end of what that kind of candidate would be willing to have a conversation about.  If your budget wont support that you should toss the bullets about great budget and high pay.To underscore it  k wouldnt even buy that skill set in the cheaper markets on the east coast  and LA is a pretty solid jump beyond even the midsize or more expensive east coast markets. years of experience is also the wrong target given the rest of the role scope.  You really need more like  years on that with both technical and leadership roles demonstrated.If youre the hiring manager your writing makes you sound pretty cool so Im not knocking you or the role itself.  The comp is just way way off.  The lack of relocation is also going to make it hard  those candidates are generally employed and need incentivesassistance to make a move.  Yes you might eventually find someone desperate enough to take the offer but theres going to be a reason for that with other tradeoffs you probably wont like.    ,NetworkingJobs,ddrjgp5,4,t5_2tvyy
