867922,0,t3_23zmwv,Ive spoken to a handful of staff members who are loyal longtime employees.  The general consensus is that an examination of this practice is long overdue.  Its too bad there has to be a public airing of dirty laundry to accomplish it but it had to happen.Here is where a supplemental pay case could be legitCaptain Hotshot has some highpaying job elsewhere at the University.  He agrees to become dean at a unit but the deanship pay is lower.  The University does not expect him to take a pay cut to do that they want the hob to be important and think he can do great things for the unit.  However the U also doesnt want to raise the base salary of the deanship to the level of his previous job.  It would raise questions from other deans who might demand comparable salary and would also raise the expectation of the next dean when the time comes.  So the base salary is a reasonable deanlevel X and then a supplement of Y is used to bring the total compensation up to the candidates previous level.I think this is the case for at least one of the people mentioned in the report.  I bring it up only to provide an illustration of how additional pay might be used and why it can be a high figure for an individual.  However this does not account for all the cases the report highlights.Its a good read.Some staff at the University have had very modest pay raises over the previous five years.  The story we were given was that during a time of declining state support and critical costcutting staff and administration must get small raises so that money could go towards giving faculty better raises.  Therefore it is a kick in the teeth to learn that our slim merit program was helping to finance large undisclosed handouts to extremely wellcompensated administrators. ,uofm,ch2xrd0,2,t5_2rjkn

From  PM   AM Safe Ride sometimes called Safe Walk for reasons unknown to me since you dont walk offers students and staff rides free from any campus location to their residence of vehicle within one mile of campus. From  AM   AM riders can take Ride Home also free from the Dude the Ugli or the Cancer Center to their residence or vehicle. The paid service Night Ride is a shared taxi service offered by the city of Ann Arbor for  that runs from  PM   AM during the week and  PM   AM on the weekends. Night Ride will pick you up and drop you off pretty much anywhere.I prefer Safe Ride Walk? to Ride Home because the drivers are university employees usually students in vans and sometimes the short paratransit busses.

5856205,0,t3_3vg9mc,Do you live close enough that you could commute for a few weeks if necessary? Or do you have friends who would let you crash with them? A friend of mine was in the same situation and didnt have much luck with sublets until after the semester started. Since her parents lived in Metro Detroit she commuted for two weeks until someone who was originally looking for a full year subletter gave up and accepted her four month offer. I think it would be hard to find a subletter in January since so many LSA students study abroad and list their places at steep discounts. The least risky version of this would likely be finding a place farther from campus that would appeal to nonstudents who might move to the area. I had a friend who had success signing a six month lease at an apartment complex near Briarwood. Im not sure what complex it was specifically. The less popular coops may still have spaces. You could also consider moving back into the dorms or renting a Northwood Apartment.

8782880,0,t1_d73e9e4,There are rules about the number of consecutive nights a guest can spend in your room but no one is actively looking to enforce that. For your information I think the limit is three consecutive nights.The main thing is to be respectful of your roommate and be mindful of their feelings. If youre proactive and you communicate with each other about your opinions on guests your relationship will be better for it. If your RA suggests filling out a roommate agreement I would strongly suggest taking that a little bit seriously and using it as a tool to discuss your feelings on guests. The big issue unless youre in a suite style dorm like Baits or Oxford is access to bathrooms. Do not swipe an oppositegender guest into your bathroom. If the wrong housing security officer catches you that can be a big deal.

10033259,0,t1_dbfauyl,I used to work in admissions and thought Id share a few things just so youre aware if people ask you in the future.  Glad that you acknowledged up front that your experience is obviously different.   Michigan moved to the Common Application in  which radically changed how admissions worked.  There was an insane spike in applications it will have doubled from K to K in a decade and as a result it has become much more competitive. Because of point  strong ECs and or test scores are not necessarily going to overcome a lower GPA.  Michigan has enough students applying with high . unweighted and up GPAs  on their ACT that they cant even accept all of those students.Last year the middle th percentile of admits had a  on their ACT.  From some of the schools I read for a . and  on your ACT was basically a guaranteed deferral.  Again it is mind boggling how much more competitive it has become I guess good news for us is it continues to raise the profile of our degree.  Students are viewed in the context of their school.  So in state vs. out of state is not so much relevant as where you are coming from and who else from your school has applied.  Some of the schools I read applications for offered  AP courses others maybe  or .  Students from those schools are going to have very different opportunities and experiences and it would be unfair to review them in the same plane. There are far more students who apply from out of state but instate students enroll at a higher rate.  So about  of students accepted are out of state but they still make up a smaller portion of the overall student population here.,uofm,dbfcza5,4,t5_2rjkn

And he is a pretty good programmer too  he was able to get an internship with CME group as a freshman.  If you like data science or computer science vs. software engineering you might choose to do research and research and internships arent mutually exclusive either  you can do research during the school year and internships during the summer.,uofm,ddx9y59,2,t5_2rjkn
10843844,0,t1_ddy2dl9,I stayed in A year round. When classes ended and my short term lease expired I always found sublets for the summer that were not only cheap but also located in fairly decent neighborhoods still student oriented. Definitely go that route. You can check classifieds either on craigslist or even the Michigan Daily student paper for a fairly good selection. ,uofm,ddygsn9,1,t5_2rjkn
10880634,0,t3_5vfx9b,Yes all classes and research for you will be on North campusNCRC.  That being said all of the things to do in Ann Arbor will be located around Central Campus and its worth living there and dealing with the longer commute. Winters kind of suck but as someone who also didnt experience winter until coming to Michigan its not a difficult thing to adjust to. Just make sure to have good winter clothing. Chemical Engineering is a great department with lots of fantastic professors. I think it has some of the most interesting research happening at the university. I could provide some recommendations as to what labs to think about joining if you provided some details as to your research interests bioenergynano etc.. The department tries to have good interactions between the grad students and faculty which is really nice. It also holds lots of social events and activities that will help you get to know people within the department as well as meet other grad students from other departments. You will see that for yourself at recruitment weekend. Making friends in other ways will obviously just depend on what you do and where you live. ,uofm,de29dd2,5,t5_2rjkn
