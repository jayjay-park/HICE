118253,0,t3_1vg3mu,I would recommend focusing your collecting on one particular aspect of the hobby that you love.  It can be a huge waste to try to collect everything for the sake of collecting partly because it is difficult to have expertise in many different genres at once.  To be serious you actually have to know what you are looking for why you are looking for it where to look and be able to spot fakes or poor quality copies.  It can also be wasteful because you end up not enjoying certain parts of your collection because you picked them up without much forethought.  Whats the purpose of your collection?  For enjoyment?  Do you enjoy those Stevie Wonder albums you got at a garage sale?  Are you collecting for an investment and for them to retain value?  Do you think it was wise to pick up that Good second press copy of Dark Side of the Moon when there are many first press NM copies available?Right now I stick to albums that I know and really like.  I research their availability average price and then find out the best ways to obtain them.  Often I just pick one album I am seeking and if by chance I see something at a very good price that is on my list but further down I will buy it.Sometimes I will go digging but when I do I set a strict budget and force myself to put stuff back on the shelf.,vinyl,cerwasp,6,t5_2qh7i

As much as I didnt like Yeezus I like that Kanye is at the point in his career where hes just doing what he wants. Starting with s it seems like he began caring more about the concepts of his records and making them really unique and different from what else is popular. Thats not to say CD LR and Graduation arent outstanding records too but theyre definitely of their time. Theyre some of the best hiphop albums of that era but I think Kanye didnt really become a real forgive the pretense here visionary artist until he started putting out weirder records and taking more risks. He was still a solid artist before that but I think because of his newer albums hell be looked at in the future as one of the greats.Kanyes early production is A though dude defined hiphop for a period of time.

Manufacturers had an advantage then of multimillion dollar budgets for RampD and tooling whereas modern turntable manufacturing is a cottage industry by comparison. Nevertheless you can get an awfully nice brand new turntable for  and a very decent one for far less so theyre doing fine work with the resources they have.  In my opinion vintage turntables do offer better build quality and performance for the money but there can be considerable difficulties in finding one if you dont live in a major city getting one shipped without damage if you dont and dealing with age and wear related issues if youre not good with electronics repair.    ,vinyl,cf11t5y,3,t5_2qh7i

The resolution is only about  Lines which is about the same as VHS. This is not nearly as much as the  Lines of Laserdiscrlaserdisc or the  lines of DVD.    A CED movie can also be messed up by dust on the disc because it uses a needle like vinyl except instead of just an audio pop the video gets fuzzy until tracking realigns. The only way to get the dust off is to fast forward and rewind over the spot repeatedly. Dust mitigation is why theyre inside those cartridge covers. The graininess of the picture makes watching a CED look like watching a worn out VHS tape.

459809,0,t3_1z9mln,Artist Lyn CollinsAlbum Think about itRelease Date Just by looking at the credits on the song tracks produced by James Brown you know its gonna be good. The first track is Think About It which if you are a hip hop fan was sampled in many classic songs. From wikipedia some include the same  bar loop of Yeah! Woo! appeared for Rob Base and DJ EZ Rocks It Takes Two or YoYo and Ice Cube sampled it for the Bonnie and Clyde Theme and many more. Before the break its got that classic James Brown feel but with a female voice instead. I was pleseantly surprised that there was a Bill Withers cover of Aint No Sunshine. Lyn sings this song with lots of emotion. To me at times she sounded like Janis Joplin right about to lose her voice. Even the Fly Me To the Moon cover has a funky feel and showcases Lyns powerful voice. I feel that there are two distinct sounds on this album. Classic James brown funky soul type sound and is proven by the sole arranged and produced by James Brown credit. Then the other songs that were produced by James Brown but arranged by Sammy Love or Dave have the Motown soul R ampB type sounds. My favorite song is Womens Lib which is produced and arranged by James Brown. It begins with the Hammond organ drums and Lyn is singing her heart out then begins to build up and goes back down to just drums and the Hammond organ and Lyn just talking. You can feel Lyns powerful voice in this song.I originally had got this album because I end up getting fascinated by the samples that are manipulated to create the hip hop songs I love. And Think about it was one of the most sampled songs along with James Browns funky drummer. I found online that it was a fairly inexpensive album so I bought it. I would recommend album to anyone that loves soul music and funk. Lyn has a great voice and it seems odd that you rarely hear about her.,vinyl,cfsj39d,7,t5_2qh7i

492001,0,t3_1zpu1d,Most of the people in this thread are recommending to buy used and Id tend to agree with them especially if you can find something thats running correctly and of decent quality. But since you said you were apprehensive about buying used Ill give you some advice on new turntables. If you stretch your budget just a little bit you can get the Audio Technica AT LP. This is the cheapest turntable that I would recommend to someone. Its not the best thing in the world but its decent quality and for the price its not half bad. Now if you do end up stretching your budget to  Id suggest taking a look at the ProJect Debut III. It has a better stock cartridge and is generally regarded as a pretty solid audiophile turntable. ,vinyl,cfw6zos,3,t5_2qh7i

If you purchase or purchased this speaker system you are still missing a vital piece of equipment an integratedsurround preamplifier. The integrated preamp is where youd send your phono preamped signal in order to be processed and directed to the appropriate speakers.Nice speaker set but youll need to save a few hundy more and acquire an integrated pre before youll hear anything.

937725,0,t1_chaurfw,The ELP Laser Turntable is fully analog  no digitization occurs. It uses a red laser similar to that in a CD player but instead of the laser reading bumps that would correspond to s and s the laser is reading the modulation of the groove similar to how a stylus riding in the groove would read the modulation.So it is behaving like a CD player you can even skip and repeat tracks but it is by all means an analog turntable. Its trying to solve problems inherent to analog reproduction in a new way although one that is not always necessarily better. Would I get a laser turntable in the future if it were significantly improved? Probably. But for now more traditional devices seem more attractive and perform better.

948276,0,t1_chc27dm,Its possible. Not a  year time line I dont think though. One barrier to vinyl is the cost of large pressings honestly. The middle class musician so to speak is one the rise and labels are on their way down. Because of this shift in market concentration you have a lot of artists doing Independent releases or putting their records out through indie labels. Getting cds pressed is way cheaper than records. I can get  CDs made for about  depending on various factors cassettes for about rds of that cost part of the reason the cassette market is also growing again and records pressed for about double to triple that cost. Now due to economies of scale its obviously much cheaper per unit to have k records pressed instead of  but theres where the problem for smaller labels or independent artists comes into play. Cheaper though it may be to get  records pressed a lot of the smaller labelsbands cant afford the  grand itll cost to get the records pressed even if they could sale a good quality  for  USD and be making a  profit margin the barrier is the initial cost. CDs do have a few small advantages. First is that they are far more durable. Try leaving a record on the floor boards of your car for a week long road trip spitting on it then using that spit to while it clean and see how well it plays. Also there is portability. You wont be playing your records in your car making your morning commute any time soon. Digital however has the advantage on portability especially via streaming. A lot of people arent ready to hop to a full lack of a physical medium. One cd breaks grab another from the case and jam it your phone streaming spotify breaks youre screwed. Ultimately I think well see a pretty even equilibrium in a a decade or some. Right now things are pretty tumultuous in the music industry as a whole. The  big labels left will either split up or shrink substantially there will be no big  in the future. It will be more like the mediumsized  or whatever. CDs vinyl and cassettes will all be established formats but due to the tactile nature of vinyl I think it will pull ahead as the dominant physical format in years to come. How much of a market there will be at for physical formats is hard to say. If I could store  TB of storage in my brain and then broadcast it to my car home stereo play it in my head use my own perception to adjust the equalization of the track and have my  library in losses format why bother with physical at all? Not spell checking this way to wordy.  ,vinyl,chc2rho,1,t5_2qh7i

986948,0,t1_chgfuwj,Coming from a pretty big The Black Keys fan though not the biggest you should enjoy what you hear. El Camino to me is pretty terrible. It seemed to me that once they got massive off of Brothers they put out another album as soon as possible to cash in. I skimmed through Turn Blue and its a lot better than El Camino but still doesnt match Brothers IMO. Brothers without a doubt is my favourite album by them just because of how consistent it is. That record just keeps going and has so much replayability. All are obviously worth checking out. MY personal favourites are Rubber Factory and Brothers. This is followed closely by Attack amp Release Magic Potion The Big Come Up and Thickfreakness. I havent heard Turn Blue enough to rank it yet but I would say put it off until youve heard at least two of the other albums at least once. Brothers in particular NEEDS to be heard.

999527,0,t1_chhwc4a,I agree to a point.  Aaron Dilloway may have started out underproducing to meet demand but at some point it had to have been pretty obvious to him that making more than  copies of those tapes wasnt going to hurt anyone.  I do agree with what youre saying and I think its kind of a line between the old and the new kind of collector.  There have always been people paying a lot of money for records especially limited or hard to find records.  But in the last  years it seems like the number of people willing to pay a premium for something that was intentionally underproduced has skyrocketed.  Tracking down something that was released in a quantity of  because no one gave a fuck about the band at the time seems like a different kind of thing than tracking down something that was released in a quantity of  so that the onesheet could say ULTRA LIMITED TO  BUY NOW OR RISK NEVER SEEING IT AGAIN!,vinyl,chhwjwg,3,t5_2qh7i

I love the story behind this record and how Gram became involved. His voice is truly magical.Favorite song The Christian Life amp You Dont Miss Your WaterThe Clash  London CallingWhat an incredible record. When I first heard this in high school I didnt know punk could sound like this. It was raw yet refined. Completely different from what I was listening to at the time. I now own original copies of every Clash record.Favorite Song Rudie Cant FailBob Dylan and The Band  The Basement TapesI looked for this record forever. When I found the last Clash record they guy who sold it to me mentioned that he had a copy of this album. I had to drive pretty far to pick it up from his shop. When I got there he wasnt there. A kind young lady called his home and they guy said I could stop by and pick it up. I got over there in a heartbeat and finally got a record I had searched for for so long.Favorite Song Million Dollar BashThe Judys  Washarama This is a local new wave surf punk band from Houston. They are badass. My uncle introduced me to them when I was in high school and I was instantly hooked. Though their records are hard to find I have managed to find every one of them with the exception of one . Im getting close!

I like the NAD phono preamp as a recommendation because I have heard it personally and it has won a few rewards and it has been a Stereophile recommended component so it is a safe recommendation in my mind.Watts alone are not the only story when it comes to loudness or even being able to truly drive a speaker neither the NAD or the Cambridge Audio puts out a lot of watts.  When you upgrade speakers down the line and want to keep the amp it means you look at a speakers efficiency rating that is how many decibels it pumps per watt like my speakers do db per watt so IT CAN RUN YOU OUT OF A BASEMENT with just a w amp when I turn it up.  ,vinyl,chsz90t,2,t5_2qh7i

This was an insufferable movie but when I heard Sexy Boy on the soundtrack I found the only redeemable thing about that movie.Beyond that I know this album is renowned for its downtempo treatment of the burgeoning electronica genre and an antidote to the overamped hype of The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers. Not that theres anything wrong with those bandsjust that its nice to chill out every once in awhile too.A few friends I have who are originally from France speak very highly of Air and claim that theyre the artistic equal of Daft Punk. Having not heard Moon Safari I cannot confirm thisbut I do note that Air is also responsible for the Virgin Suicides soundtrack which was quite intense.I cant wait to crack open this album and see if it lives up to the hype.

You fully immerse yourself into the music and the time it was created.  You can feel the intensity of the Vietnam War in the record and you know that someone back in  played the vary same record many times before and probably felt the same way you feel while your listening to it it totally connects you to a past generation or person.

Youre seeing records that youve never seen in the wild and the next thing you know you just dropped  on a handful of albums. But heres the thing... a Doors LP with a very worn sleeve is not nearly worth . A copy of Sgt. Pepper with a taped sleeve is not worth  either. Record shops and antique sellers prey on people who are new to collecting by putting absurd prices on wellknown artists because they know someone will come into their shop think oh my gawd! a beatles record! and pay whatever the asking price is. Personally I think asking for more than  for either of those records is outrageous.Since there arent any shops in your neck of the woods consider shopping online. Discogs eBay craigslist etc. Itll save you a ton of money and youll learn about the market in the process. I bought my copy of Sgt Pepper with a sleeve in better condition for . on Discogs last year and it arrived on my doorstep a few days later.

Unless youre flatout calling a blogger youre not even familiar with a liar the test results he got speak for themselves.

1714523,0,t1_cjuxdbe,gt I have sold records that would go for thousands  years ago for half the price. Im curious what youre selling that has depreciated so much in value. I cant say whether its a buyers market overall but I think it really depends on the genre or niche. About  or  years ago I unloaded a ton of records I bought in the college years we seem to be about the same age so you might be able to relate. Originally bought at retail prices sold at Theres Nothing Wrong With Love prices. Stuff like original pressing White Stripes or the diecut white vinyl version of the second Death Cab LP. I have stuff that Ive bought retail since then that has appreciated up to triple digits in just the past  or  years. Nobody cared about early DIY bands like Desperate Bicycles in the early s and you could get their s for cheap. Same goes for early My Bloody Valentine. I knew a guy who assembled a complete Bicycles discography got bored with them and unloaded them all for hundreds each and now their value has waned again.Im sure a smarter man than me would understand the economics of this. For me its all about space keep what you love no matter what its worth. But sell everything else because I gotta stop moving  boxes of LPs every time I change apartments. ,vinyl,cjva0b9,2,t5_2qh7i

The asking prices on Discogs I have found to be pretty much useless.Bottom line you can follow some decent general selling advice and still get screwed big time in the record game. If vinyl buying is anything its casebycase. Too many variables. Edit so far the eBay idea is your best bet. Keep in mind they take a pretty big chunk of your cash then wait a couple weeks to release the rest. And in a dispute you are likely to lose bc eBay favors the buyer.All this is the reason why I very rarely sell unless Im culling a bunch of commons and trading em back to the record store,vinyl,cka1dxs,2,t5_2qh7i

I love the history of the albums just as much as the albums them self.  Im only  and have grown up on oldies radio.  I look at records as history and take the best care of them because I hate seeing records thrown away.  I see it everyday where records arent taken care of.  I love the history because it matters what was happening at that point in history and what the artist was writing about to make the album what it is.  ,vinyl,cke1cnx,3,t5_2qh7i

When it was released it was unheard of for such a great quality of amp to have what was a relatively low pricepoint so much so that it was quickly dubbed a giantkiller and it created a category in the marketplace all of its own.Was it i.e. the original version superseded by subsequent amps? Definitely. Amps from Marantz and yes I mean the Phillips owned years of the s and s Rotel Pioneer eventually and the like all made amps that equalled and bettered the original  though NAD continued this amps lineage into the s themselves with the abei etc variances  and it was always a contender. But the original is still a damn fine amplifier.NAD still reference the model number today see their digital D amp from last year.Maybe its my particular age but the golden age of hifi for me was the early to mid s. Its also probably down to it being the point in which I started taking an interest in hifi gear. Whilst the styling of boxes from that era  all black and anonymous  might not be to everyones taste I think thats a great opportunity to take advantage of unfashionable kit.

2086865,0,t3_2ismfb,I have a Debut III with the stock platter so I cant comment on the acrylic except it looks badass. But I have upgraded the cart to a M Red. It was not as straight forward as I had hoped. The Debut III seems to have an issue with very brittle tonearm wires. They snap off if you look at them the wrong way. I have read in numerous places that this is an issue with this table. I currently still have a ground wire issue somewhere inside the arm and the right channel cuts out frequently this began a little before the M install when I checked alignment on the OMe. The tags snapped multiple times during the M install and even after soldered and heat shrinked still were very brittle. Ive since ordered a new wiring kit for the arm and will disassemble to replace all the wiring internally the RCAs have been done already. I think when this is done the table should be rock solid. I still highly recommend the table but beware of what may happen during a cart upgrade. ,vinyl,cl534m4,3,t5_2qh7i

Ive taken very good care of the needlearm Thats fine for now but the longer you play records on that turntable the more likely they will get damaged. Just like the Crosley tables. It sounds fine now and nothing may seem wrong but playing your records on a better table will get you some better sounding results. That looks like a Sony PSLX table. I used to have the same one. Its just too light and theres no counterbalance on the arm. It scratched the shit out of some of my records and Ive never looked back. Id also be careful to not store your records like that. Prolonged storage when stacked can cause some records to warp or cause distress on the grooves plus it can mess up your album covers if you care about that stuff  Either way keep up the collecting! ,vinyl,cllhyq5,2,t5_2qh7i

Side A is a bunch of vignettes or stories narrated by Laura Olsher. Following her brief introductions are sound effects telling the story. Titles include Shipwreck and The Dogs. Side B is just sound effects. Probably the most famous and unPC track is one called Chines Water Torture. Its sounds of water dripping dripping dripping dripping followed by Laura doing her best worst fake Chinese. Wow that would not be on any record these days.My favorite is The Martian Monsters. Its interesting how something like this can bring you back  plus years. The album was first released in the s I must have picked it up out of my dads collection or maybe I bought it at Disneyland.

Id think the sub would easily move the speaker overtime or make noise due to the stand rattling on top of it. End of the day though if it works for you then it works.

2583473,0,t3_2pdh8e,I think a lot of it is the fact that rvinyl is made up of a lot of different countries and theres a lot of European bands on vinyl that a lot of us here in America go WTF? about. The wonderful thing about collecting vinyl is finding stuff you didnt know about. The National is now the cool indie band out there and its trendy to know them but I bought Alligator and Boxer because the guy in the record store asked if I was looking for anything and I said what are your current recommendations. Cut to me buying those two records Calexicos Garden Ruin and an old Jackson Browne record. However there is a dark side to this subreddit where people get really pretentious and try to show off that pretentiousness and I would encourage you not to get bitter about it. If youre in the mood Spotify some of the artists you dont know and see what you think. Just keep listening and finding stuff you like. Dont worry if people here or otherwise dont like your taste in music. The point is its your taste in music and fuck the haters who want to shit on you for liking a certain band.

2655291,0,t1_cn55q5e,I hear what you are saying but I disagree.  Elitist as always is a poor choice of words but theres nothing wrong with letting kids enjoy it for a while or to learn on their own if they want to take their hobby to the next level.  Who knows they might not be lifelong record collectors and in that case every record they own will get sold anyways.  Or maybe they just dont take it as seriously as the guys who wants to buy  dollar decks they are more casual and dont care.  Nothing wrong with that theres all kinds of people listening to records.  Your car analogy is flawed they turn to the right and to the left.  I think its more like comparing a Yugo to a Porsche not everyone can afford the Porsche but they both have steering wheels that work.  Youll get laughed at driving a Yugo but itll probably at least get you to work.  And records are the gasoline you can put premium unleaded in a Yugo and itll still run although it wont keep up with the Porsche any better than regular unleaded.  Car companies make cheap cars for people with less money and teenagers learning to drive who will statistically ruin the car anyways  and they make luxury cars for rich people or more experienced older drivers as it is with record player companies.  Just as we cant expect everyone to buy the Porsche its not elitist to think they should its just unfair and unrealistic to insist upon it.  I agree with the OP Im no Christmas angel by any means but its especially unfair to squash their bubbles on Christmas morning.  Let them enjoy it until they are ready to upgrade and even if that never happens let them be happy with what they have regardless.,vinyl,cn56crv,12,t5_2qh7i

2688724,0,t1_cn9iqgd,I had an MP player for a while. I actually found it kind of cumbersome. I had to connect it and turn it on every time I got in the car and start it playing. I had to charge the batteries otherwise it would die. I didnt want to leave it in plain sight in the car lest someone decide to break one of my windows and steal it.Tapes are pretty darn easy. Leave one on the player it stops and starts with the car. Leave them on the seats and in the center console nobody is going to steal them  or the indash player. I have my music without having to think about it so I can concentrate on all the other things I need to use the car for.That said its sure easy to get music on to the MP player. Not so much with tapes. But the process of recording tapes is kind of a fun experience in and of itself  just time consuming.I can see someone buying music on cassette for the nostalgia and the experience of it. I mean listening to records is kind of a ritual  and I can see someone having a similar attachment to tapes. For me theyre kind of utilitarian but I see where theyre coming from.Id be more likely to buy the album on CD or vinyl and record it to the tape for all my portable listening. Even back when cassettes were current thats what I did. I do buy a lot of albums on cassette at thrift store though.

2693342,0,t3_2qu194,When you have lived in  cities in the last  years moving stuff becomes a hassle. My cds are in special storage crates and housed in Jazzloft sleeves and take up much less space and weight a lot less than vinyl. I have less than  LPs right now and even those were a pain to move. From a purely utilitarian standpoint Id just be listening to all my music via digital or streaming but I like physical formats. I didnt grow up with Spotify or Pandora like the average teenager that posts on here.To echo points made by others the best sounding version of a particular album is not always on vinyl. Sometimes its a CD because the pressing was bad. Many times to get equivalent good sound quality youd have to buy an older pressing of the LP version is extremely expensive. Many albums I love were also never released on vinyl. I love vinyl but I intentionally limit what I buy on vinyl due to the reasons outlined above. Vinyl makes up less than  of my collection with CD being my primary format. I also have cassettes paidlegal downloads and a streaming account I can listen to if I want. Streaming is something I use the least its good for listening on the go when I dont have access to a physical copy of what I want to listen to or if I want to check out some unfamiliar music and discover new things.In general I try not to focus on the format too much if Im getting the type of sound quality that I deem acceptable. For me its about the actual music over anything else. ,vinyl,cna50ot,1,t5_2qh7i

2740473,0,t1_cnfk8tf,The problem with a lot of these super low end tables is that they dont track very well. When you couple with with relative high tracking force you get into a situation where damage can easily occur. The timeframe is tricky but even one play where the arm does not track well and skips can damage records. For this reason I suggest that anyone who has one of these record players starts of by listening to cheaper dollar bin records if they enjoy the hobby they should look to upgrade. If you are already buying new albums which now cost quite a lot of money you really should be ditching the table as soon as possible. ,vinyl,cnfkweg,3,t5_2qh7i

2772332,0,t1_cnj6tzd,also understand that spinning vinyl is an expensive hobby. you said you wanted a turntable with builtin speakers for max .  is a decent price for a budget table alone. youll need an amp to go with the TT followed by speakers. if a preamp isnt builtin to the TT or the amp youll need a seperate phono preamp. the full system can run a minimum of . it seems pricey but it will last you a long time and you wont have to upgrade for awhile you will need to replace the needle for your cartridge tho but thats inevitable.if it isnt in your budget you should start investing plain and simple. you really arent missing anything by not listening to records so you dont have to feel like theres some big secret in music youre missing. yes a good system sounds leaps and bounds better than earbud music or a crosley because theyre pretty much the same thing but thats just something to look forward to as opposed to something to be desperate for.thats just the way i see it anyway.,vinyl,cnj7cvu,2,t5_2qh7i

I joust cant see myself doing a proper clean before every listen because itd just kill the joy of it. I like to spend my time listening not doing choresThe real point of this question is not about playing a record as being a solution to cleaning an old dirty record but rather regular play being a good way to keep a record from getting badly dirty in the first placeedit and to the original point.... if the stylus doesnt get right down to the bottom of the groove... what does it matter if its gunked up then? the stylus doesnt reach the gunk!,vinyl,conv8sx,1,t5_2qh7i

3163189,0,t1_copu2rk,I also dont see the attraction to the RP but I do see happy owners. There are differences in the deck itself and the subplatter that turns under the platter. The platter itself is laminated to add more glass and weight which improves speed stability. The RP comes with the external power supply which provides pushbutton speed changes and a minor improvement in sound quality. If you want any of those upgrades beyond the subplatter the RP becomes the better deal. I like the GrooveTracer subplatter upgradeson the RP as well as the RP and any Rega above the RP but below the P. I started with a Planar  then moved up to a P with a GrooveTracer subplatter and the Rega belt upgrade then moved up to a stock P. Ive been happy with them all.

Even vibrations that originate from the movement of the stylus need to be properly isolated and the feet of the turntable arent capable of this. This is the basic idea behind using an isolation platform such as granite wood sandbox bike inner tube marble etc..Also having your speakers two feet apart like in OPs set up creates a collapsed sound stage unless youre sitting further than two feet away from the speakers.

In my case I buy new stuff cause I like it and I dig for nostalgic stuff because I actually have money to buy it now as opposed to being broke and .As for pops and clicks. It depends. Yeah it can ruin a good song but on the opposite end of the spectrum it can make a song. For example if reissues of old Delta Blues s on LP didnt have noise it wouldnt be that great.

If someone removed the sleeves the clerk just looks up the album in the system even for used vinyl.

Everyones been praising her and her music for a long time so I wont go into that too much but to be honest I wasnt sure if her latest album could match the raw awesomeness of her EP. I was wrong. I just got back from an hourlong excursion through Richmond VA after missing out on the last copies of her record at two different stores and it looks like I ended up getting the last copy in the entire city though some are restocking this weekend. The album sometimes i sit and think and sometimes i just sit is just as strong as her previous installments and its chill funny and laid back. A few tracks have already been released as singles. The vinyl which is orange came with a turntable mat that has chairs all over it and her namethe name of the album. Not sure if Ill swap it with my baby blue Technics mat but well see.On the insert there is a photo of the band along with the lyrics to all of the records songs and a thank you note to a bunch of folks. Theres also a card with a code for a digital download of the album. My favorite tracks Elevator OperatorPedestrian At BestDeprestonAqua Profonda!

3688853,0,t1_cqcd79m,To be fair some of the songs on the White Album were also mixed into stereo first even though it got released in Mono as well.  Helter Skelter has major differences between the Mono and the Stereo the mono is actually edited and shorter and has no fadeoutfadein at the end! and Revolution  was mixed live in the studio with many tape machines going all at once getting dropped into the mix by Lennon at the console almost randomly.  That mix was stereo from the getgo and the mono version is just a folddown of the stereo mix.But Pepper for me is just two different experiences.  Both the Mono and Stereo mixes have interesting bits.  People say that Shes Leaving Home being played slower at a lower pitch in the stereo wrecks the song I just say it gives it a different color more melancholy slightly less hopeful than the mono version.  The edit going from the last quack at the end of Good Morning Good Morning to a distorted guitar that starts the Reprise flows better on the stereo version.But you know whats even more fun?  Playing around with the original tracks for some of these songs!  A few years ago I found torrents of Sgt. Pepper With a Little Help From My Friends Shes Leaving Home and A Day in the Life and had some fun producing new mixes from those.  Theyre raw transfers of the contents of the final track tape with all the previous mixdowns already done.  A Day in the Life in particular is a lot of fun to remix.  For the big orchestral moments I like to fade out everything else and just leave the orchestra  the result is much more dramatic.  For the bit where Lennon is kinda floating around after McCartneys bit again taking out the rest of the band and keeping only the vocals and the orchestra makes that part much more powerful  and did you ever realize that McCartney also kind of harmonizes with Lennon during that bit?  Its hard to hear on the final mix but you can kind of hear it in the multitrack.,vinyl,cqcr5bs,3,t5_2qh7i

3730984,0,t1_cqhibhn,Thanks for your thoughtful remarks!gt Is the surface noise just a sound file that you mix in with the MPOGG we drop on the window?Essentially yes. My original attempt used a collection of short samples of vinyl noise played in a randomly generated chain but performance was abysmal and it didnt sound as good. Current browsers including Chrome have a slight delay in playback which caused gaps between the samples. I could overlap them slightly but the gap length was associated with hardware speeds so it was an unreliable solution. So I went with one long relatively long loop until I can come up with something better.gt dropping the needle anywhere other than the runin groove should play the song from somewhere in the middle.Actually thats how I programmed it and thats how it works on my local development instanceit calculates exactly where in the song it should start playing based on the angle of the tone arm when dropped. But I see that its not behaving that way in the online version which is annoying because I was proud of myself for figuring out the geometry. Very curious I will need to inspect it. Thanks for pointing this out.gt a pitch slider would be fun to play with.gt a speed selector well one to set the recording speed of the record and one to set the playback... maybe consider offering all  speeds    .These along with a volume slider will eventually occupy the empty space on the brushed aluminum portion. I also intend to have a condition selector similar to what you described above and improve browser compatibility. This version is not quite done I uploaded early because I thought it would be fun for RSD. gt a startstop button. My turntable doesnt have a cue lever so I usually place the needle on the record before I even start it spinning then I press start. I cant be the only one that does this.I have tinkered with this with the intention to make the playback speed match the actual turntable RPM as it comes up to speed if it is stoppedstarted during audio portions but at the risk of getting too technical the spinning animation looks much smoother using CSS animations which are currently in use but using CSS removes my ability to detect the spin speed via Javascript. I can animate the rotation with Javascript directly instead of CSS and I tried it but it was choppy to the point of great distraction because this loses the hardware acceleration benefits of CSS animations. So in short Im not sure how to accomplish it yet.gt I dont know how easy this is to find but if you can find a sound processing library that allows simulating a tube amp I bet a large portion of the people here will appreciate it good tube amps do color the sound but usually in a good way they make it less harsh cutting part of the surface noise in the process and cause the bass to rumble a bit more. For a lot of people this is how vinyl normally sounds to them and this is how vintage records from the s and s are remembered.With local filesystem playback like Im using here I dont have the liberty to modify sounds I can only layer other sounds atop it such as the needle drop sounds and vinyl noise. I could do more complex processing if the files were uploaded to the server but this would make the startup process much slower as large files uploaded and open me up to potential legal problems if I accept copyrighted music files. So I might be stuck on this one unless browsers add more comprehensive audio manipulation tools.,vinyl,cqhk1cw,2,t5_2qh7i

3759679,0,t1_cqkrqtj,Thats how its supposed to sound though it it a weird edit. The intro on the record is  eighth notes long and probably was edited rather abruptly. The first note lands on oneandtwoAND in the bar you can hear him do the full guitar part later in the song about a minute in before the Cookie! bit.Lennon was often impatient and didnt mind leaving errors or rough edits in sometimes doing them on purpose. There are examples across his and The Beatles records eg the coda of Yer Blues the end of I Want You Shes So Heavy the start of My Mummys Dead. You know when it goes bambambam after the final versechorus of Revolution ? The engineer on the session accidentally left in an extra beat when editing mixes and instead of fixing it Lennon made him add a third.Theres also a terrible edit in Working Class Hero where a verse from a different take was spliced in When theyve tortured and scared you for twentyodd years which sounds completely unlike the rest of the song. Apparently Lennon forgot to sing that verse and it sounds like they took it from a home demo. The edit when it goes back to the master take misses out a few beats too.Youve got me intrigued now.

3827587,0,t3_349khc,A few thoughtsI call bullshit on the whole the flaws of analogue reproduction is why the music sounds better.  There are many reasons why a record may sound better than a digital recording  and distortional warmth is not what has me drawn to the sound of records.There is no mention of the fact that a record is a piece of art that represents the band.  The cover is bigger and can be appreciated as art  unlike CDdigital artwork.Collectibility.  Some people love to collect things.  Records are historical artifacts and work very well as collectibles.  Look at the baseball card market or comic books etc.  Will digital baseball cards ever replace someones drive to own a Honus Wagner?  The collectible record market is hot right now.  Used records.  Stats like these are based on purchases of new records.  I think the sales of new records pales in comparison to the amount of used records bought and sold on a daily basis.  I know for me its probably a  ratio.  For every  used records I buy I buy one new.  I realize that its very difficult to get stats on used records especially since they come from so many different types of markets but I really think THATS where the real story is.Record Store Day.  The increasing number of exclusive releases each year doesnt necessarily reflect the popularity of record store day.  In my opinion it is more a reflection of big labels finally realizing there is an audience and attempting to milk it for every penny that they can squeeze out.,vinyl,cqsks6r,7,t5_2qh7i

3834058,0,t3_34cd99,Records are meant to be played...  To a point.  Once they are so destroyed they skip or are so poor that all you hear is white noise it basically lost its sole purpose.We all have beat to hell records that are completely unplayable.  If the thing is so destroyed you cant play it and NO one can play it it either gets tossed or repurposed.  People make clocks out of them bowls by heating them and folding the hot wax upwards they make all kinds of things out of them.  For practical purposes being a beer drinker coasters were the way to go for me.  Yes youve seen them before but they are easy as pie to DIY so I figured Id share my method.Its simple.  All you need is a power drill.  A hole saw and a sacrificial unplayable record with a decent enough label worth trying this for.The center drill bit in a hole saw fits perfectly in the spindle hole so you can do this drunk.  Tip Always operate power tools with at least a mild beer buzz.Take your  hole saw stick it in the hole put the record on a sacrificial piece of wood to hold the record and bit steady during the cut and press the drill trigger.  Like butter theres the coaster.Then you gotta pop it out of the hole saw with a tiny flat head screwdriver.  Then lightly sand the coasters edges.  Next glue some cork on the bottom I use spray glue cut the cork with a sharp exacto knife after its glued glaze the top with a little polyurethane  coats is fine  coats is better.   Thats it done.BTW might wanna do the poly and gluing outside the stuff stinks.You can use the leftover vinyl for another artsyfartsy project perhaps if its red vinyl and you are good at shaping it you can make a Devo energy dome or you could just toss it.  Edit I forgot to mention sanding edges are a bit sharp after initial cut.,vinyl,cqtbdxb,25,t5_2qh7i

3994746,0,t3_368akg,Heres a list of general things that help to prevent skipping as well as the TT picking up thunks from walking. TT placement in the room. Unless you have a concrete floor some parts of the floor are springier than others. The more stable the location the better.. Isolationmass. These two work together. Ideally you want the TT coupled to something massive slab of woodstonemetal which is then isolated from the floor through foam tennis balls silicone gel carpet whatever.  A triedandtrue favorite is to place  halved tennis balls I actually prefer blue rubber balls as they dont allow sliding under a slab of stone roughly the size of your TT then your TT over that.. Vertical tracking force. Unless you set the tracking force by listening to a test record its best to aim for the upper part of the recommended tracking force range. This is for reasons not entirely related to skipping but may help anyways. That said I wouldnt recommend setting your VTF outside the recommended range eh  a gram extra is probably fine as it will change the dynamics of whats going on with the stylus cantilever and suspension. Its the rubber of the stylus suspension that pushes against the tracking force to keep the cartridge off the record surface and by overloading it you may push it out of its linear range as well as risk damage to it or the record if the cartridge bottoms out completely.. Cartridge choice itself. Again this relates mostly to the suspension specifically the compliance of the suspension compliance here is the opposite of stiffness. I wouldnt go too far down this rabbit hole as youll be spending money based on nothing more than anecdotal evidence. Besides youre running a cart that ships with that TT and lots of people happily use in combination.So long story short Id recommend briefly investigating TT placement maybe enlist the help of a friend stand still in one spot while the friend stomps around the room change spots and repeat bumping up the VTF if your cartridge will support it and then experimenting with different isolation methods.,vinyl,crbmulj,7,t5_2qh7i

4020818,0,t1_creldn9,You probably want to search for receivers not amps. Most of the time when you are referring to amps in a home audio setting they will be called receivers because they are used to receive and play radio signals as well as amplify sound to passive speakers. Some companies do put out units that are strictly amps but that is pretty rare and usually reserved for nicer models and hifi equipment like tube amps. If you still cant find anything on CL or locally you can check here just skimming through those search results I can already see there are some vintage models available. The rest is just setting a maximum on how much you are willing to spend and using that to bid on listings you like until you get lucky.

4094170,0,t1_crmxi28,gtSo what happened with the baseball card prices after the bubble poppedLets just say that I have a lot of kindling for a fire if I ever need it.Basically most cards from that era are completely worthless. Some retain a minimal value that card you had worth  in  is now worth  but for the most part theyre barely worth the cardstock theyre printed on. I have boxes upon boxes of them in storage  I didnt save them specifically because I thought their value would increase but because my interests changed completely and I was too lazy to get rid of them at the time.gtdo you expect the same to happen to the price of records?I think it will but I dont think it will be as drastic. Its already happened once due to the popularity of CDs  but I dont see happening again as drastically until we are able to D print our own records. Much like how Napster killed the greedy CD industry.However I do see retail prices hitting a peak soon. The average consumer will be priced out of the market it will wane in popularity and all those superrarediecut varientslimitedtocopies are going to be selling for waaaay less than they are now. Once it becomes unappealing to  year olds again well see prices drop dramatically.Of course thats just IMO. IANA market analyst. ,vinyl,crmylk1,2,t5_2qh7i

4313724,0,t1_csbtauk,Thats definitely not the reason. They would usually just press with more distance between grooves on a  and pass it off as having done it to increase sound quality and to keep a standard size which is probably a lot more important to most people than feeling like they got a lot of music per inch honestly. A lot of records are pressing with less on a side today for this increased quality. Compare these  or  songs a side to the compressed Ktel compilations where they could sometimes cram  tracks on a side. Unless you have a  single youre not going to have a ton of noticable dead space  itll just play though quicker like the Jimmy Eat World represses or M albums do. On the flip side Kid A and several of the Radiohead albums are pressed on x and could have just as easily been on x with their similar length.

4343361,0,t1_csez0fy,No. The speakers are rated for up to whatever the specified wattage is but you would not be using that much power to drive it to listenable levels. In general you dont really want to be approaching the stated limits of power handling for either the speakers or amplifier as there will be more distortion.You need to look at the sensitivity of the speaker. For example the Pioneer SPBSLRs mentioned below have a stated sensitivity of  dB.Vm meaning given .V W for an  Ohm speaker .W for a  Ohm speaker like this example a microphone at m will see  dB.Doubling the power increases the volume by  dB. So W would produce  dB W  dB W  dB and W  dB which is pretty loud OSHA says no more than hr a day at  dB. Of course its more complicated than this because our sense of perceived loudness does not scale exactly with power see here or here or here for more explanation.,vinyl,csf87n7,3,t5_2qh7i

4527113,0,t3_3d2mpg,By upside down do you mean that the grooves are inverted?These are either masters plates or stampers. If the grooves match a vinyl record then they are plates or masters. If the grooves are inverted and exposed then they are stampers.Basically when pressing a machine cuts grooves into a metal disc that serves as the master. From there the master is coated in a thin layer of nickel which produces the father plate. The father plate is then coated which creates a mother plate. In two step processes the father is used as a stamper and the mother is stored for future plates. In a three step process the mother is used to create multiple stampers and the father is stored to create new mothers.A father can produce multiple mothers something like  or  if I recall correctly. A mother can produce a similar amount of stampers. A stamper can produce between  records depending on the equipment used. This means one mother is capable of producing up to  records and one father x more than that. So the max amount of record you can get from a single master is somewhere between  again cant remember if the metal parts can produce  or  of each other.If larger pressings are required youll need a new master plate cut. Even if cut from the same original audio source this is considered a remastering which is often confused as the term is also often used with the audio source by remixing the levels of the audio. Mind you plates arent kept for long and their quality can degrade so unless you are pressing such large quantities in a short time chances are that youll be cutting a new master for a repress years down the line. Hence why most labels take the opportunity to remix and remaster the audio at the same time. Anyway... This is most likely a plate or stamper depending on the orientation of the grooves. Are they worth anything? Maybe as a collectible only... I would certainly not listen to these unless you want to wreck your needle! But yea if they are popular or rare recordings then Im sure some collectors may want them. Edit I forgot to add that when you press a record you give the plant instructions on what to do with the metal parts after. You can have them sent to you with the vinyl stored for X amount of time or destroyed. By default most plants will store for  months in case you want to repress in that time. That being said plates and stampers being out in the wild isnt unheard of since some labels may prefer to store them themselves after a press is done. ,vinyl,ct1a3gp,46,t5_2qh7i

4544625,0,t3_3dan84,I just posted about this topic the other day. So this is mostly cut and paste...Its a question of physics not brand. The trick is to get the shortest thinnest cable needed to carry the maximum rated power load directly from the source to the destination. That will yield the cleanest signal.Using thicker than necessary cables too high resistance can lead to signalclarity loss and low frequency attenuation. Using too long cables too high capacitance leads to high frequency attenuation. Long length cables except optical or differential signal also sees significantly increased noise floor hum from mains power and RF signal interference.TLDR If you are experiencing hum hiss or or interference due to long cables upgrade to inexpensive shorter cables rather than fancy brand name cables with spaceage looking connectors and weird colored sleeves unless youre in it for the looks rather than the sound. ,vinyl,ct3h5y5,3,t5_2qh7i

4665472,0,t3_3euql0,I think one the dust settles in a few more years or so much of the people who recently jumped on the vinyl bandwagon will hesitantly go back to digital. This could mean a few things for noncasual vinyl collectors and stores. People who bought Crosleys to play their copies of Lazeretto and Random Access Memories will probably attempt to sell them back either through ebay Amazon or going to their record store to sell them back. Of course this means in the future vinyls popularity wont be where it was at once but honestly I dont see it going away for good. However once these newer records start piling into the used bins they probably more than not will be slightly shoddy and be ridden with groove wear from the horrid ceramic carts most people use. I think the fact that this degradation of quality may drive future record enthusiasts away from collecting but that rules out people who buy vinyl strictly for the aesthetic. I see vinyl as a medium reaching its second peak and then riding on a plateau of moderate popularity amongst music lovers and audiophiles.

4699414,0,t3_3fat3x,gtI dont want to get into buying new records on vinyl when I could have it downloaded or on CD or something that fits the modern time period more. Going on this alone the answer is no. VMP is all newlypressed vinyl. Even if they had for instance Born to Run as their album one month it would be a fresh pressing of it not a copy from the s.That being said a lot of new music in certain styles is being put out on vinyl. I only buy vinyl. A brandnew record almost always includes a free mp sometimes even FLAC! download code too  so you can still throw it on your iPod or listen to it on your computer or in your car or whatever.I say Almost always but I have literally never bought one single brandnew record that did not include a download code. Im sure theyre out there though.So for your  you not only get the vinyl record but you ALSO get the digital files  and at a higher quality than iTunes offers unless theyve ramped up their quality.

4826698,0,t1_cu2aish,This is a little off topic but here goes...gt I think a lot of people have lost their love for albums. Most people I know and music lovers with huge digital collections tend to listen to a variety of things and almost never sit down to just listen to an album from beginning to end.This seems to be a fairly common sentiment but I dont really agree with it. People bought and enjoyed singles long before they ever bought an LP. Even after the LP become more popular many if not most people still enjoyed buying their favorite tracks individually on . Enter cassettes and people still cherry picked their favorite tracks to create awesome mixtapes. Enter the CD and people were pretty much stuck buying a whole CD to get the few tracks they really liked. When digital formats allowed people to go back to just listening to exactly what they wanted of course it was going to explode.For me listening to an entire album is a pleasure  if I like listening to the entire album.

4949454,0,t3_3inffi,i think people are willing to pay too much because they know that records have historically been valuable but mistakenly apply that logic to new records without understanding the context of actual monetary and collectible value. ever see that guy who finds a beat up copy of the white album at a flea market and is convinced he just found an arbitrage opportunity?expensive records used to be about real scarcity. before cds used vinyl was literally the only way to hear some stuff so it went for a premium. i remember even seeing a market for jackets only being valuable enough for resale.so  and i know this sub wont like this  i think people new to vinyl are willing to pay more for a new record which is artificially scarce because they are aware of truly scarce records going for absurd amounts of money in the past. its a bubble based on a misunderstanding of scarcity and utility. how else can you explain a  White Stripes ? is that the only way to listen to it? why buy that and not listen to it? the precedent for expensive vinyl was set by people who wanted to hear stuff not mount it in a frame and brag about it. that is historic root of these valuations which people dont seem to recognize.i pay a premium for records i cant hear any other way or which are scarce in a manner where they are very unlikely to be repressed. the new market doesnt seem to see things that way.their bubble pricing madness used to be contained in new releases rock and electronicdance vinyl but recently ive been seeing prices creep up in used jazz contemporary classical funksoul etc.i dont know how so many people can afford these absurd prices and i want this bubble to burst. ,vinyl,cuif2vr,5,t5_2qh7i

You will probably notice a difference in sales with certain records when selling online a person collecting classical records will probably just go on discogs and buy the best quality of exactly what they want not go to a store where its very unlikely that youll find something special.I went to a local store and the guy had piles of CDs and vinyl.  I didnt find anything and he told me how hard it is to find what classical people want.  Another store has what I consider gems pretty consistently.  So you just have to know what is good and bad because that one guy doesnt know shit about classical and the other is right on the money.

Id guess they cut costs here and there but its also possible that these are exact clones of the AT model and Crosley just has the buying power and market presence to offer it at a lower price point.There are plenty of manufacturers out there who are buying the same parts as other guys and just rebranding.This is a positive direction for Crosley especially since their name is trusted by people who are still fairly new to the hobby andor lack the funds for a VPI McIntosh tube gear and horn speakers.,vinyl,cvtyc3c,0,t5_2qh7i

5499125,0,t1_cwe6sn1,The stylus definitely makes all the difference. There are actually two forms of IGD one avoidable on the playback end  you can do something about this and one that can only be avoided during mastering. Investing in a better stylus will definitely bring your performance up to a new level however Im not so sure its worth investing more into upgrading the a. Im not typically a fan of performance of the audio technica carts.   The closest thing to the shure mxeSAS combo is the audio technica mla or mlb I personally think the shure combo is a step above but in reality they are extremely comparable and often are. The vivid line stylus for the at which I believe is actually manufactured by JICO features what is essentially an SAS type stylus mounted on an aluminum cantilever and unfortunately that is only half the battle in tracking your discs more accurately. This is also true of the SAS stylus made for other cartridges  not all are built to the specification of the one for the mxe which has the diamond mounted on a boron cantilever which has very different performance properties in comparison to aluminum. For that reason Id sooner invest into another elliptical that you can later upgrade the stylus on rather than investing into a pricey stylus that is unfortunately hindered by the cartridge it is mounted on. ,vinyl,cwekcuc,2,t5_2qh7i

Add a  buck preamp  and you got a good xmas gift for less than this pile of garbage Anyone who knows better and is recommending a Crosley over that is simply being unhelpful and irresponsible. ,vinyl,cwoffk7,3,t5_2qh7i

The albums I want are always very close or higher than the highest historical discogs prices. So I can only buy select things there but when I do the math and calculate the risk Ive always been fine with it. To order an album for  online Im taking a risk that the album is potentially overgraded something will happen during shipping andor it was only visually graded so could have issues with audio. If I can avoid the risks by spending  and check it out before buying and avoid Canada Post from bending the thing in half  Im OK with that.

This is one of the many videos I found on preamp removal for my turntable. I cant imagine yours is all that different on the inside. Some tips for you there may be tiny metal spacers on the inside of the plastic molding where the screws enter. Watch out for these. Leave yourself lots of extra wire when you cut them. Make sure to have something to rest your table on so the weight isnt on your tonearm. If you dont have tools go to your local hardware store and tell them you need to splice small gauge wires and they should help you out. You dont even need to solder anything. All together this mod took me like  minutes. If youre worried about the warranty just wait until it runs out to open your table up. I hope this helps! Have fun.,vinyl,cx5azhw,2,t5_2qh7i

5914658,0,t3_3wa46n,At one point I bought small tension rods so the records couldnt be pulled out very easily. It worked until my daughter was old enough to try to pull herself up on them and then had to get rid of them. Then we tried redirecting her every time she was near the shelf which was mildly successful. She has gotten a few out and colored on the sleeves. This would have made me mad at one point in my life but now whenever I listen to Lou Reeds Dally Cant Dance it reminds me of the blue crayon decorations that my daughter added to the cover when she was  months old and gives a different hue to the music.

Both of them are essentially big warehouses with records neatly categorized.Other stores like Good Records and my store Spinster Records will have jazz but mostly reissues of stuff like Coltrane and Davis. If you want originalobscureodd stuff youre better off going to a more cratediggy type store. Also for what its worth HalfPrice Books is a chain store in the area that has a lot of vinyl depending on location and people are constantly trading in vinyl there. Ive found some good jazz buys from time to time but it seems like most HPB locations are getting better about figuring out that maybe they shouldnt price original s Blue Note albums for .each. Haha. The biggest HPB is on Northwest Highway but prepare to duke it out with every other record nerd in the metroplex for fresh picks.

If your turntable is even decent the speakers are going to be what make or break it for you and having an amp thats powerful enough for the speakers is the other important part.

It still definitely requires a certain very rare mood for me to be into it but for what it is its great.  TDAG I dont consider it an emo album.

The tonearm design is one that requires perfect calibration at the factory however due to the cheap mass produced nature of the table the tonearm is not set correctly in a large number of cases resulting in poor playback usually manifesting as skipping especially on ewer thicker records.

6369906,0,t3_42uzc8,Usually Id comment to not bother with spending  to try and upgrade from a Croz and to check the sidebar but im bored on a nightshift so....First off the  that you plan to eventually spend is generally where good new turntables start. Spending  plus is quite common for a true audiophile table. That being said I use a moderately priced ProJect Debut Carbon and for my setup and budget it works very well with enough room to make small upgrades in the future. My advice to you would be to save your  and keep using your Croz until you can afford something better. If you have certain records that are rare or valuable set them aside and play stuff that you dont mind damagingis easily replaceable. I used to cringe at people playing anything in a shitty turntable but if you play a Boston album until its shot you can probably go buy another for a couple bucks. Save your cash until you can pick up a decent budget table like the Audio Technica you mentioned. Ive also heard great things about the ProJect Elemental and I love the minimalist design that helps isolate motor noise. Now if you are impatient and need to go get something NOW you should be looking at something that is used and that you can test out. When looking through ads read the description and see if the seller has maintained the turntable replaced belts installed a new cartridge etc. If youre shopping at a thrift store make sure you try it out. If you want to get really picky you can try and print out a strobe test sheet to spin and check it that way. The problem with most used tables is that they will have an old cartridgestylus that will likely need replacing. Id try and find one that someone can confirm has already been changed. Whatever you buy make sure it has a counterweight of some kind usually looks like a short fat cylinder at the back end of the tone arm. This isnt a guarantee that it wont damage your records but it can certainly help get your tracking force set correctly. For speakers there are tons of used options. Do a little research and check out anything used to make sure its working and the speakers are intact. For new I would recommend two budget options..... If you dont want to buy a receiveramp you could go with powered speakers may need a phono amp depending on your turntable. Mackie makes reasonably priced studio monitors that apparently work quite well. .

Tbh the living room was full of clutter until the housemate moved out over the weekend. This gave me the perfect opportunity to put the system as the centrepiece. Who needs a TV right? Im quite happy with the setup. I have to say Im impressed with the A having done all the research availability and budgeting the amp sounds more powerful than I expected. The Zenzor s are fantastic. Fills the room and much more punchier bass than I imagined. I was looking into floorstanders but after listening to these it feels like I dont really need anything larger for the time being.I did a lot of research looking for a turntable. This was my first venture into the world of records in general. I grew up with cassettes and CDs and later digital music. But the idea of vinyl was very intriguing to me. I remember as a kid I saw a record player once at a hostel and I knew I had to get one of my own someday. So I wanted to start off at a decent point. In the end I went with the Project Debut Carbon mainly as it came with the Ortofon M Red which got a lot of great reviews. And Im very pleased!,vinyl,czq2rs9,2,t5_2qh7i

Or you could get a power amplifier and connect it to the receiver if it has inputs for that. I like vintage amps because of the look and quality. Modern amps can sound just as good if not better but have a lot of unnecessary stuff like HDMI.

People that have those records are going to know enough to trade them in to an actual record store for cash or store credit instead of dropping them off at Goodwill. The last time I tried to go thrifting for records I found one used CD I wanted and zero records. All the vinyl was schlock I didnt care about or in such piss poor condition I couldnt buy it. I remember picking up a Merle Haggard LP that was actually broken in half when I pulled it out of the jacket. I know some folks still hit the jackpot thrifting but these folks are going to several stores multiple times and week and spending hours digging through beat to shit albums and schlock inhaling a bunch of dust and mold in the process. Maybe they hit the jackpot a few times a year after all that. I just dont have time for it. I rather dig at record stores and find some decent used vinyl in the  range. ,vinyl,d01yhci,4,t5_2qh7i

Speakers can be better secured to your stands using sticky tac that light blue sticky play doe stuff  this helps absorb vibrations protect your speakers and keeps the sound from feeling like its shaking. You can also use thin foam which is used in tool drawers.  Its a few mm s thick and acts like memory foam.  The best method is to use metal spikes on the bottom of your speakers which IMO produces the cleanest sound.Stands are important because they raise the floor up to the speakers so that the speakers play at ear level.,vinyl,d0h04ew,1,t5_2qh7i

7132334,0,t3_4d9428,I feel what youre getting at  but I really think there is no album that should be in everyones collection. I mean there are albums that you should definitely listen to if you like a particular genre but owning a record is a completely different thing. People buy records for a lot of different reasons and sometimes they have nothing to do with music. Our turntable is more of a family turntable so I mainly buy records that I know my wife will also like. So as much as Im into gangsta rap or hardcore punk I just dont own records in those genres. I play that music in the car or on my headphones mainly. So people curate their collections in different ways. Another example is that Im not really that interested in buying albums that I used to listen to a lot in the past. So although a lot of classic rock may be essential listening for pretty much anyone interested in popular music my tastes have largely moved on and Im not interested in investing the money or the space for it. The thing I love about vinyl is that you really cant own it all. So you have to be very deliberate about your choices and what you choose to include and exclude in your collection.

7217663,0,t3_4eb8lf,Howwhen did you first become interested in listening to vinyl? november What about the experience of listening to a record is important to you? listening to music as an activity to be valued just as much as any other activity instead of just putting on something in the background. the physicality of owning media is wonderful.Does the physicality of the record play any significance to you? How so? i should have read ahead... see above. it is of HUGE significance.Do you believe the experience of listening to music digitally differs from a record? If so how? yes. its digitized and even though it may be a faithful representation of the original master it has still been digitized compressed uploaded download etc. etc.  a record is just a record. it never changes. Is there a community factor present among individuals whom own vinyl? not for me.What are your thoughts on the recent reemergence of vinyl? well im part of it but i appreciate the work and time people have put in to their collections i dont buy anything i dont plan on listening to and im not some shithead kid just buying up new vinyl for  a pop because its cool.hope it helps,vinyl,d1ylc92,3,t5_2qh7i

7301901,0,t3_4fdx1n,If thats the only record you have that sounds bad then for once it isnt your TT. The fact that its NOT skipping could be related. Its very possible that theyve dumbed down the sound so tables like yours can play it without skipping. Bass is the first thing to go when they do this since its the leading cause.Its also possible that they were working off of an unsuitable CD master with more bass and treble than any record or cutting machine can handle. The metal bands like their CDs LOUD and use all sorts of digital tricks to make it happen  tricks that just cant be cut into vinyl. When faced with this a cutting engineer really doesnt have any choice but to drop the bass treble separation and sometimes volume just to make the stuff trackable and get it to fit on the record.Or it could be just another very bad day at United Record Pressing. A worn out or mistreated stamper can make mushy sounding records too. See My copy of Lazaretto which Im STILL mad about even though I havent listened to it much since.In any case you usually cant compare the sound on CD to the sound on LP. There are just too many variables both human and technical that can cause them to sound completely different. Thats no excuse for a wussy sounding metal album but there you go.,vinyl,d286ddg,2,t5_2qh7i

7457131,0,t3_4hilm4,With a rare Monday off I figured Id clean up the house a bit grab some husband points and spin some of the records I snagged this weekend. Pumped to get my hands on Princes Batman soundtrack. Luckily Ive been grabbing his records out at the flea market for the last few years so I havent had to pay any of the crazy prices. This record comes from England as even with shipping it was cheaper than anything US based on discogs. Everyone loves Batdance but we all know Partyman is where its at.Currently listening to the best of the sugar hill gang which I traded my copy of BlackStar for sorry!. Ive been hunting for some of their inch singles and striking out left and right so I felt this was a good chance to grab the hits and see if I should keep digging further. So far its certainly a good time. The towering inferno was a cheap pickup Im torn over. Im working on completing the John Williams soundtracks and this record is in great shape but the cover is in really rough shape. Any tips on helping it seal properly would be appreciated opened on both sides and Im thinking maybe a glue stick may do the trick best.Pumped to snag poltergeist  by Joe renzetti who also composed childs play this addition rounds out my poltergeist ost collection. This is on deck to be played after prince. If you like s soundtracks especially horror give childs play a listen its wonderful. Lastly my jaw dropped when I found Texas is the reasons do you know who you are? Its a hot topic repressing on red vinyl which I grabbed for  bucks. The guy didnt know what it was and it wasnt priced but still had the hot topic sticker on it for . so I offered . I believe it goes for about .

I put a small piece of clay on the finger lift which prevented contact between my skin and the actual headshell and that seemed to help a lot. I couldnt replicate the issue with my main headshellcart and eventually it just... stopped. So I really have no idea what caused it or what made it go away but the best I can think is that reseating it made a better connection with one of the pins which have been problematic in my tonearm in the past.

Forget about a Crosley or any of its countless offshoots and variants out there since they never last long due to utterly poor QC and build quality.

It peels easily and bonds to the surface even less than it does to vinyl. I say only do it as an absolute last ditch effort to get a better transfer and only if one transfer has already been performed. At your own risk of course.

8133141,0,t3_4qlxt3,Ive been listening to records since the midnineties. For a while I was buying records because they were much cheaper than CDs to own the album at the time especially used records.Presently Im buying records mostly used because I want to own the original pressings from when the music was first published. I listen to older punk  new wave  ska primarily when a lot of the stuff was naturally on vinyl and I like having the physical version of the music is it was released when new. Sometimes Ill get a repress if the original is too pricey or just impossible to find.As an offshoot of that some stuff I listen to is only available on record being from smaller labels in the s  s that no longer exist and which never made it to CD or streaming. So vinyl is the only way to really get it.If Im buying new releases of current music buying a record makes it more of special investment and makes me listen to the record more intently. I try to buy direct from the artist or the label to give them the most profit. If I stream something I really like Ill try to pick it up the record as a way to support the album as well.,vinyl,d4u8ler,3,t5_2qh7i

Nearly  of my records in my collection were bought online through websites such as fatbeats and rvinylcollectors. I love ordering online and waiting for my record to ship in the mail. Every now and then I treat myself to a record that I wanted like Kamasi Washington box set for example. Even if a record shop opens in Dubai I will still order most of my records online because online sellers have more variety of records and its a better experience in my opinion.

The group has had a handful of projects before this including this years Wriggle EP and this is their second fulllength studio album. Their beats are typically very noisy experimental and almost industrialsounding at times. Daveed Diggs is an incredibly skilled MC who brings a refreshing level of accessibility to experimental hiphop his lyricism and delivery are much closer to what youd find in a conventionally good hiphop album as opposed to what youd find in a Death Grips or B L A C K I E song.I personally love Clipping.

No TT or amp issue would selectively affect a single speaker across channels.Edit Triple check the rca cables and especially the speaker wire. Disconnect everything then reconnect your system carefully. Hopefully you just crossed something or didnt clip a wire in firmly. Otherwise isolate everything. Try radiocdipodcomputer instead of turntable. If the speaker works for other devices its your TT  check to make sure your cartridge is still firmly hooked up and the rca cables are on correctly. If the channel is consistently out whatever is hooked into the left channel doesnt work across inputs then something is probably messed up in your amp.,vinyl,d6aat6k,1,t5_2qh7i

AND chances are the majority of these records were potentially meaningful club tracks in there day but probably not to you. and even if youre thinking of wanting to get into DJing in the future these records still likely wont work out because youll probably have specific ideas about what records you want to buy and spin. dance music is so specific and niche that unless these records are exactly what youre into its probably a big waste of time and money for you.and lastly if theyre club records theyre worn and there probably isnt much resale value in them. which is why dealers likely have already passed on them and this seller is now semidesperate to find a buyer.,vinyl,d6kgvs0,17,t5_2qh7i

The label has a solid light blue prism. Subsequent pressings have a blue glowing inner edge prism with the centre black.. The Gramophone Co. text starts at  oclock on label.. AB matrix stamps appear in the runout area.. Thick heavyweight vinyl believed by some to be the finest and most true encapsulation of this historical recording as the first pressing was pressed direct from the original masterplate. . There is a distinct bluish tinttinge in the black ink of the cover.. There are three known original sleeve variations. . The right front opening of the gatefold cover is sealed with the two sides glued together. . The right front opening of the gatefold cover is sealed with a fold over flap that is glued inside the opening. . The right front opening of the gatefold cover is not sealed. A known  matrix  mother G stamper copy came with  an unglued and nonfolded in sleeve at time of release which hints at the possibility that very first pressings did not come with glued flaps which is where the poster and stickers were located.. Inner sleeve is a distinctive polythene lined die cut black semi matt paper with white printed text stating  patent numbers bottom left  and MADE IN GREAT BRITAIN bottom right.. Posters and stickers were printed on paper stock that has a rough texture later pressings used paper that was gloss laminated. . Stickers have printed backs with diagonal lines across them and the words Fasson FasPrint and CrackBack.. First copies came with a small round sticker white text on blueish black stating Pink Floyd The Dark Side of the Moon confirmed for stampers GLMO.,vinyl,d6nsvkx,1,t5_2qh7i

Never thought a pen was anything different.  In my s I discovered fountain pens and I love them and use them whenever possible.  My parents think Im nuts.  They grew up in a world of fountain pens and jumped ship to ballpoints as soon as they became available since theyre basically perfect  they cant leak they write for months nonstop without refill they can last for years in your desk drawer without attention and all pens of a given make write exactly the same.Its possible that vinyl is the same way  I grew up with the inconvenience so I love the convenience of digital and as soon as digital got good enough that I couldnt tell the difference I jumped ship.  I still have a largeish LP collection but it is now evershrinking as I rip and discard source material.  Maybe theres some ineffable quality of LPs that Im simply missing or maybe the ritual of maintaining a record collection and turntable is a nice comfort in the face of an increasingly convenienceoriented world.  ,vinyl,d81lnbz,4,t5_2qh7i

I get the impression from your wording that youre thinking of changing this setting depending on the record. Its something you set for a specific cartridge not something you actively change.  The weight of a record has basically nothing to do with how it sounds. gtIs there another kind of turntable with same quality as crosleyWhy oh why is this your criteria?!

9517843,0,t3_5b773x,The sealed record is The Innocents debut album. There are a lot of bands with this name but this unique sounding band was active in the s. I couldnt define their sound each song sounds different for the most part. Call em new wave or pop rock all I know is that they sound like The Doors meets Psychedelic Furs. Oh and the record isnt that warped. I was a bit skeptical ordering a still sealed record but it turned out just fine.The VG record is Dreams so Reals debut album Fathers HouseSurprisingly I can deal with the pops and ticks. Its not too bad it only gets annoying for the piano part in the beginning of one of the songs. I can live with it since I only payed  Canadian including shipping for both records. This is probably my favorite album out of the two I ordered. Everything about this bands music is timeless. If Johnny Marr put on some overdrive and Morrissey had a voice box transplant this would be it. ,vinyl,d9m9z95,3,t5_2qh7i

9575093,0,t1_d9tbc1l,I think the initial recordings were actually on  then something happened to the tapes theft? and they rerecorded everything in protools but then mixed down to . So not all analog but the master is an analog tape. Ideally an LP would have been cut direct off the tape and avoid yet another round of ADA conversion Cut by the late and otherwise great Stan Ricker so this makes the problem even more excusable. Theres a very obvious digital glitch between Holiday amp Boulevard of Broken Dreams where there should be a seamless transition. If they supplied files to cut from why not supply them as single files for the entire side not separate tracks. Digital glitches like that could probably be avoided or the sequencing issues that plagued the last release of John Lennons Rock amp Roll album with duplicated tracks etc. if you ensure that the master you supply plays out you know like it should. Of course it mustve slipped past Stan while he was cutting it and everyone who listened to test pressings afterwards. A stellar work.  I tried to return it immediately but theyd only swap it out for another copy. Hot Topic doesnt understand how vinyl works apparently like the issue wouldnt be present on the next one they ripped open. I wouldnt recommend buying this on vinyl. ,vinyl,d9tbqm6,2,t5_2qh7i

9634898,0,t1_da0ndvy,Cannot as in the player isnt designed for  standard mount cartridges in mind and instead Sanyo opt to have the infamous red ceramic cartridge built right into the tonearm.  Also there are no wires to hook the cartridge into that tonearm since the ceramic cartridge is built into the tonearm.  The plastic tonearm is merely springloaded into the base which means adding weight at the end of the tonearm is utterly meaningless and futile.  Even if you manage to jerryrig a cartridge from say Ortofon or Audio Technica into the tonearm it would be riding far too low and would likely be too heavy for the plastic tonearm to handle it.  In other words you would very likely destroy the cartridge and its stylus cantilever and suspension since it will be bent right down due to the very low clearance between the platter and the tonearm on the Sanyo.What you are doing is an exercise in futility and akin to trying to place a massive hotrod engine into a Ford Pinto or rather build a working toaster made entirely out of chocolate.

This analog vs. digital signal chain discussion is bollocks a typical correlation does not imply causation thing.Overall quality is less these days since its not the standard format. From an interview with a retired mastering engineergt In the last year especially there have been problems with supplies in the blank lacquers that we use and in the cutting styluses that we use. And with the insanely busy pressing plant situation it seems as though many many more issues have been popping up at that level as well. That means lots of recuts are needing to be done compared to how it used to be and right now there are two pressing plants in the country doing vinyl the way it should be done and thats it.

Not being a CD guy or super keen to sit through the exact same setlist so many times I opted instead for this stand alone release of the Royal Albert Hall show. Awful cover image aside the concert itself is amazing. If anyone has the previous show from this tour released as a bootleg series you may not necessarily need this one same set list fairly similar sound. That being said Dylan is on point throughout. The opening acoustic set is truly an amazing thing to hear. Ive never understood people that slam his voice as I find he is able to convey a million shades of emotions with it and he does so one the first lp. Visions of Johanna is probably one of my top  favourite songs of all time and this acoustic version is on a whole other level. Set  is when he plugs in with his band and explodes. This tour was famous for a couple things heavy drug use and hostile audiences during his electric sets. For this particular concert the crowd seems pretty respectful and into it. The finale of Like a Rolling Stone really sounds like a violent cathartic release for Dylan as he puts everything into each syllable. To sum up ESSENTIAL,vinyl,daxv9nh,1,t5_2qh7i

9944850,0,t3_5hx30k,If it helps I have one of these on order. I have heard nothing but great things about it!  I will echo the comments of others on here  I didnt see a reduction in static moving from felt to cork on my uturn. And depending on the record static varies dramatically. Climate affects things too. For the health of your house you want humidity below  percent. Its winter now and my indoor humidity is about  percent! That dry climate seems to cause more static to build up. I played the Cure Head on the Door last night and when i lifted it off to flip it the mat came with it  Its a nice black  gram pressing. Phantogram III went on right after  its a lighter white vinyl. No static AT ALL. I super clean everything with my antistatic brush and keep them in mofi sleeves. Doesnt seem to matter. I live in a dry house with  cats and a husky. The climate  pet hair  the nature of vinyl   static electricity buildup. There are lots of good articles out there on why and how to avoid  guessing you already read through most  Good luck! ,vinyl,db3u74y,2,t5_2qh7i

If these record companies wanted to they would sell it for  and make a huge profit.

I recently got that cart and am not ready to ditch it. Because of that the Tube Box is able to offer me some flexibility on cartridge loading and longer term will be able to handle if I end up with an MC cartridge. Additionally I had those RCA tubes collecting dust and knew they would offer a bit of color in my audio chain. There is a very satisfying fuller sound on older presses that were play tested on tube gear and are of that era. Even some recent presses still struggle in the HF area but that is likely just the pressing.It really all depends on what you have and where you want to go really.

Imagine going to a photography sub and showing off your new disposable kodak.But thank you OP for taking the time to ask and research and not just coming in guns blazing with a new setup. As for the LP  it is missing some necessary features antiskate counterweight that causes poor tracking of records and premature wear of the vinyl. The headshell and cartridge are fixed to the tonearm which means factory settings is as good as youll ever get from it. Overall build quality is poor and is known to have speed issues. No one here would recommend it for someone who seriously wants to get into the hobby. For someone on a budget we will always recommend going vintageused and we would gladly go through local ads to find you something within your budget thats miles better than the LP .

Because youre able to to make it go away by moving the TTs output cables that really suggests that what youre hearing is a ground huma low hum at a single tone. And the fact that moving the cables can help really suggests that its in the cables or perhaps right where the cable meets the plug. I dont really think theres any more trouble shooting you can do. This is not usually a terribly involved repairredoing the plugs is much easier than replacing the entire cable tho. Just a question of whether you feel comfortable trying to do it yourself or not.

The majority of my collection was new when I got it.  Slide it out of the inner sleeve and try to hold it by the label and the edge.  Fingerprints are very bad.  I always tried to put the records back away as soon as I played them.  Some folks would slip the record and inner sleeve into the cover with the open end out so the record could just be rolled out.  I didnt think that was enough protection so I always slid it back in with the opening at the top. With proper care records likely dont need to be washed.  I have always used a Discwasher  they are still on Amazon.  The original ones had a directional fiber to the pad hold it the right was and dust came up off the record onto the pad.  A quick swipe the opposite direction on a pant leg removed it.  There is a Diskeeper Stylus brush on Amazon that looks to be built like my old Discwasher one.

TLDR  I cant say no to vets We have a record store in town that just stocks jazz and blues and the owner keeps a pretty good stock without a lot of filler or junk. Just solid offerings in good condition. I was in there one day in the mid s and he puts on this record. The first song opens with a wailing organ that just whines and screams and goes fullon blues. Stormy Monday After a minute or so I ask him what hes playing. He stops the record and tells me who it is and how this is the song he would put on when his forward base would come under fire from the Viet Cong. Every time he plays this record it reminds him of good friends bad times and that no matter how fucked up shit gets it probably wont ever get that fucked up again.

It can often be attributed to dirty pententiometers aka as pots and switches. The receiver controls should be cleaned with a quality electronics cleaner and then followed with a lubricant. While it isnt a cureall it works in a large percentage of the cases I have done it.Audiokarma.org cleaning guide for your receiver  I recommend Deoxit electronics cleaner followed by Deoxit fader lube. If you cant get that then CRC QD Contact Cleaner BLUE can NOT red can and their lube work well.

However the other day I noticed that the azimuth is a little off. I read somewhere else that per Teac there is no way to adjust it.Its a removable headshell one of the keyed types so it cant just be rotated when the collar is loose. Ive looked at the headshell keys and theyre definitely off center not  and  oclock.Heres my dilemma Im still in the window to return it to Amazon but theyre going to want the whole table sent back. Im perfectly comfortable shipping it but then I risk getting another unit with a speedmotor issue just to solve the headshell problem. Ive not contacted Teac directly but from what I can gather theyre going to tell me to contact the vendor anyways. Theoretically my other option is to just buy a new headshell for . That way if I get another headshell out of spec I can just ship that back instead of the whole table. I wouldnt mind spending a few extra bucks for that.Ive attached a photo maybe you guys will tell me that Im crazy and its totally fine.

10466838,0,t3_5px915, Looking to buy a turntable and cartridge  around  primarily looking used.  Im considering an original VPI Scout with an Ortofon black listed at .  My gear follows     Speakers are Philharmonic Audio Philharmonitors with Fountek ribbons and SB Acoustics . woofers.   The turntable will connect to my Audio by Van Alstine Transcendence  RB Tube Preamplifier with an integrated AVA Vision Phono Preamplifier which can run various load settings for MM amp MC.     The speakers are powered by two Emotiva UPA monoblock amplifiers.  Im considering upgrading these too as the sound out of the headphone jack on the the preamp is golden.     I listen to digital sources using the Arcam irDACId like a turntable that can easily adjust for higherend cartidges later down the line and not be outclassed by them.  Any thoughts on certain VPI or Rega models or other manufacturers that I should be hunting for?  Ive also seen older Linn Sondek LP tables selling in this range.

Thanks to ualtonspeed and ugruttepier for their record posts as well.ampnbspAvail  Dixie Lookout! Records . Sophomore release on Lookout! Records by Richmond Virginiabased punk band Avail. Dixie is the beginning of Avails mids peak when they released their best music. Im torn between this album and their follow up  AM Friday  for my favorite album of theirs AM Friday is often heralded as their best and contains their singalong anthem Simple Song. Nonetheless Dixie is an excellent album showcasing Avails seamless blend of mids hardcore and punk. I have the  Lookout Records pressing but Suburban Home Records reissued the album in  as a xLP with the second LP containing their Live at the Kings Head Inn   and Attempt to Regress  . My favorite tracks are On The Nod Clone Virus Beliefs Pile Model South Bound  ampnbspBruce Springsteen  Nebraska Columbia . Recorded on a Track Portastudio in his New Jersey house in the winter of  Springsteens sixth album is made up of ten tracks that were originally meant as demo tracks for the E Street Band. Springsteen eventually released the demos as an album because of the encouragement of his producer and engineers who found that the full band versions were lacking the stripped down raw nature of the demo tracks. The album is definitely my favorite Springsteen album and is an interesting contrast to the poprock anthems found in Born In the U.S.A. released only two years later. Nebraska shows off Springsteens singersongwriter skills and the underlying folklike construction in which he creates his music. My favorite tracks are Nebraska Atlantic City Johnny  State Trooper Reason to Believe ampnbspBilly Bragg  Talking With the Taxman About Poetry Elektra .  Released in  this is the third album by the English singersongwriter and leftist activist Billy Bragg. This is the first album in which Bragg starts incorporating a backing band into some of his songs unlike his first two albums which were only him and an electric guitarmy preference is still towards the tracks on the album where it is just Bragg and his guitar. While Talking With the Taxman About Poetry is not my favorite Bragg album it still contains some of his best tracks see the five listed below and is a great starting point if listening to Bragg for the first time. This is one of those records I found in great shape at a local Goodwill for a dollar. My favorite tracks are Greetings to the New Brunette Train Train Levi Stubbs Tears There is Power in a Union Help Save the Youth of AmericaampnbspNeutral Milk Hotel  On Avery Island Merge . I included this album to be a little facetious as Neutral Milk Hotel especially their sophomore album In the Aeroplane Over the Sea seem to be pretty polarizing on rvinyl. Its unfortunate that the last decade has turned their most famous album which I thoroughly enjoy into hipster fodder and pretentious coffee house banter about Jeff Mangum falling in love with Ann Frank does it make me more or less of a trendy asshole since I listened to them since the late s when I was in high school? probable more. I picked up On Avery Island sealed in a record store in . The album was released in  and was Neutral Milk Hotels first release not in a cassetteonly format or a  and the first to have a full line up rather than Mangums solo work. Likewise it is their first album to have a much more polished nondemolike sound though it definitely keeps their signature lofi indie rock sound found in all their releases which is either something you love or hateI dont think Ive ever heard anyone say theyre okay. The BSide of the LP is one of my favorite BSides of any album I own and unquestionably overpowers Side A. This album contains some of my favorite Neutral Milk Hotel songs including two songs that always hit me with their hauntingly beautiful sadness Three Peaches and April th. Overall its a great album if you enjoy lofi indie music and definitely holds its own compared their latter work.

10738042,0,t3_5tmgi8,A bit of commentary that Strife record I got as one of my first used records. It was at a store that gives you  off any used item when you buy a new one. I had downloaded this when it came out and wasnt very impressed. I loved the first two Strife records and had heard this would be good AND had the benefit of Igor Cavalera playing drums. As a digital album it was ok at best. But on vinyl cranked up? It sounded incredible!

10754409,0,t3_5tukah,I have a problem with buying second hand records as although cheaper doesnt be an option to me as I dont want to take a chance that its got one or two scratches when I get it. When buying online which is how I buy  of my records I want to get a new product that I know wont have scratches or marks that a seller online may not see any point in telling me about just so they get the sale.I understand your frustation at the prices but thats what happens when they make different and limited versions of things. Its been happening more and more with video games and if it isnt for you then just avoid it dont buy them and if there is a vanilla version at a price you are willing to pay then you will know how much it is worth something to you. I do like to get a special version if the record means a lot to me but this is an expensive hobby and like anything else you have to budget and might miss out on some things.There is the new David Bowie No Plan record coming out in April and one site has a limited white version with a few extras but I ordered the plain black version at almost  of the price and that will do because I just want the music.I ordered Mastodons new record with a tshirt and badges and album poster only to change my mind after not enjoying the first  tracks as much as I wanted to. I then cancelled that order and just got the record preordered on its own from a local retailer and the money I saved can go towards other records. I do care less about coloured vinyl than I did a while back but still like to see what different options are available and if they are the same price I may go for the one that looks best to me.Are you really saving that much money buying preowned records if those records are newer releases? Is it worth the gamble of buying second hand with there being more chance of damage?,vinyl,ddp8i13,2,t5_2qh7i

There are other locals in my area that charge far more reasonable prices for secondhand records i.e. anything below  but they do not have an as large selection as some others charging heaps.Its a fucked world.

I know the motor is accessible through a hole in the bottom of the plinth and there are adjustment pots for  L and  H rpm.  Ill have to check again to see if theres a third for  rpm didnt see it on cursory glance.

10965142,0,t1_deaxmd6,I would absolutely avoid any console system. They look cool as all hell but are never going to sound as good as something built in the s or later. Youre going to run into tricky reliability and maintenance issues. This is a bit like buying a car from the forties to try out driving.A quick google suggests that this model does not have a counterweight on the arm which means that the needle might be very heavy in comparison to a modern turntable which in turn means it might be hard on your records. It is stereo tho! So thats something. I thought it might be so old that it would only be mono.In my opinion when youre dealing with older consoles youre dealing with equipment thats of an age where the important thing isnt the reputation of a given model so much as the shape that the specific unit is in. Plus its pretty hard to make a comparison because these older consoles are just different animals.If youre interested in vinyl as a hobby Id get something different. If youre interested in antique electronics as a hobby then hey. Go for it. Its a cool looking console. Id suggest only using dollarbin records on it. ,vinyl,deaz6rq,4,t5_2qh7i

Either a Stylus  or Stylus  depending on what your budget says. Thats a lot more buckbang than buying a whole nother cartridge. That cart plus the Stylus  is essentially a M Blue minus the technicolor plastic.ETA And since theres so much discussion on dusting methods let me put in a strong recommendation for a vintage not one of the new RCA ones  they suck Discwasher brush. It has curved bristles that trap and lift the dust rather than just lining it up on the record. Fluid not necessary in fact the D stuff that comes with it is not so great. You can use a few drops of distilled water on the leading edge if you feel you must. Leading edge The one the arrow on the handle is pointing to. It has to be the leading edge or the bristles are pointed the wrong direction.If youre doing used vinyl you should invest in a proper record cleaner  either a vacuum machine or if youre skint after buying all that gear a Spin Clean.,vinyl,deetg8a,4,t5_2qh7i

You need to save up and increase your budget. What do you currently have other than the Crosley? Sounds like powered speakers if you are plugging in the turntable directly into the amp. That said if you are playing cheap thrift store records enjoy them on your Crosley. If they have monetary or sentimental value play at your own risk.,vinyl,deu8tf1,2,t5_2qh7i

One thing you can experiment with if you experience any signal loss issues is to remove a cross shelf on the kallax if possible in this configuration and mount your amp in there as well then run speaker cable to your speakers. Im sure youve already figured this out but make sure to keep your records up off the floor as well with pups running around.

I expect that when you floated the arm you werent really at zero grams of tracking force but rather still at negative tracking force meaning that it was tipping backwards rather than balancing at zero.

11434672,0,t3_638jz6,Dont bother with Jerrys if youre looking for exclusives because he only sells used vinyl. Its a great store and quite spectacle but not the best spot for RSD.Im in the Pittsburgh area and in my experience you better not be claustrophobic if youre planning to go out to any record store on RSD. Most of these places just arent designed to have a huge line of people all coming in at once and its exhausting and frustrating. Plus if whatever you want is actually sought after you better be waiting outside of the store at  a.m. to get it. Most of the times I went looking for an exclusive release Id ask the owner and hear That was the first thing we sold this morning.So yeah Pittsburgh has a lot of great record stores but RSD is usually a nightmare there. The only store I like going to for RSD is Assumption Records in West Virginia. They offer food bands etc. and it feels like an actual celebration instead of a sardine can of people and records.,vinyl,dfs3x8y,3,t5_2qh7i

11703184,0,t1_dgme2ej,The very peculiar thing about this Soundtrack as it explains in the liner notes is that Monk absolutely paid no attention to movie cues and was completely indifferent to the movie. All the songs performed on this set are what his bands repertoire was at the time so its played as a straight ahead jazz album. If it wasnt labeled soundtrack you wouldnt be able to tell the difference The performances are very top notch and fill with excitement and surprises youd find from Monk.Edit would also like to comment that the sound quality on this release blew my mind you can hear every detail to the bite of the saxophones and the mix really fills the room definitely a go to record to impress those who want to hear some hifi jazz.,vinyl,dgmkpb3,3,t5_2qh7i
11703447,0,t1_dgmlhif,You must be fun at parties.Ah the copyandpaste comment of a truly brilliant mind. Im amazed you didnt choose something equally brilliant like butthurt.I do understand sarcasm. You see that paragraph above this one? Thats clearly sarcasm which is stating the opposite to mock or convey contempt. I think youre the one who doesnt understand it... that or youre just terrible at using it. And what are you trying to say here? That your beloved president is so unpopular that posts against him get more likes on social networks? Seems like an odd thing to admit. ,vinyl,dgmlrzo,8,t5_2qh7i
11710350,0,t1_dgn9g3f,I saw this review that makes me believe the low output is caused solely by the stock cartridgestylus.  Do you concur what are your thoughts?review saysIt does come with a cartridge but its not a good one. The one supplied has a Conical Stylus which is the worst for sound reproduction as it rides high in the groves it also only puts out . mv of power which is not much. I added a Grado Green cartridge with an Elliptical stylus and it puts out  mv of power the best part of this turntable is the fact that you can replace the cartridge with the best one you can afford as this is what produces the sound and you sound system is only as good as your weakest link,vinyl,dgneby0,1,t5_2qh7i

11779346,0,t3_680pfq,As others have said youll need a good preamp amp and speakers to back it up. Id argue theyre as important as the player itself. When you get them space out your speakers by about ft and keep them on a separate surface from the turntable to prevent vibrations making the needle skip,vinyl,dgv85sm,3,t5_2qh7i

11798171,0,t1_dgxbv1r,Not true records are black because of the added carbon which homogenizes the material and protects it against premature needle and particle wear. Colored Vinyl has inferior chemical composition and thus inferior durability and thus is noisier usually straight out of the package. ,vinyl,dgxd32i,1,t5_2qh7i

11806459,0,t3_68g9q0,If its the record a clamp may help a little bit but clamps are ridiculously overpriced and I doubt youd hear an audible difference.  On both my turntables I have had a clamp and can confidently say there was no difference in sound.  The slight bounce of slightly warped records was not stopped either.My current Music Hall .

11807350,0,t3_67icvd,HeyThis is pretty much just a vinyl noob asking for some help and advice. A couple of months ago i bought an used turntable. It was an Technics SLBD. As far as i know there are no flaws with the engine and so on.Its been working great except for some i would call it enginesound wich can be heard through the speakers untill today. I recently bought the ...Like Clockwork  by Queens of The Stone Age. It consists of two vinyls. Now as i mentioned i dont know a lot about vinyls but when i first gave it a spin i noticed it played slower than it does normally. Thats why i turned the rpm from  to . In the beginning it sounded fine but i quickly realized it was not playing as it should. I would often hear the record going slowly down to what i would imagine rpm for a few seconds. This kept happening multiple times through out both vinyls. As far as i know the vinyls are in perfect shape since i did not buy them used. I should also mention this is my first vinyl wich i play at rpm. I can attach a video or sound recording of it if it is needed. So i am asking you guys if you have any guesses on what might be causing the problem and if you have any solutions. Thanks a lot. ,vinyl,dgyejxn,1,t5_2qh7i
