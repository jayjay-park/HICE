5363421,0,t3_3ogpif,Niiiice re EMIL LIME. WARREN CHAMBERS episode  Warren is a network of interconnecting rabbit burrows.  like the hivemind he was helping to create. So it seems like names are significant in this podcast. WINONAMeaning amp HistoryMeans firstborn daughter in the Dakota language. This was the name of the daughter of the Sioux Dakota chief Wapasha III.OSCAR TOTEMA totem is a spirit being sacred object or symbol that serves as an emblem of a group of people such as a family clan lineage or tribe. Oscar has a few meanings but according to Google one of them is Divine Spear or God Spear. Lia spelled backwards is Ail... not necessarily significant. ,limetown,cvx8kdz,7,t5_39exm
5376915,0,t1_cvyyhs2,I guess the fact that she pointed out that the limetown podcast website was created with squarespace got me thinking that there might be some hintsclues on it possibly? Like in the old days with the donnie darko website or any of the websites fictionally created around LOST.,limetown,cvyymrd,2,t5_39exm

5949909,0,t1_cxyqkbd,I want to disagree entirely...I felt like it was totally fine. I got a whole season of a podcast and they only gave a tiny mention of GE. And when they did it didnt interfere with the story at all. Way better than hearing about squarespace and naturebox three times an episode,limetown,cxzkads,10,t5_39exm

7320835,0,t3_4fkdpi,Go back and listen to the podcast again and try to picture it as a tv show.  Remember tv is a very visual medium so personal stories fall into a show dont tell trap.  Can you picture the story of the Reverend and Napoleon being as emotionally moving without the husky voice of the Reverend telling how he killed Napoleon as a mercy to a traumatized friend?  Or visually trying to show how he felt Napoleons afterdeath communication?More touching for me is the ending of Scarecrow.  Im sure that tv could do a decent job of showing the madness that led to the burning  but that would lose the point of the episode.  Deirdre found Max in college lost him for a while in Limetown had a profound moment of connection to him just before it all went to hell lost him again when she blamed him for what Hummingbird did and realized that she was wrong when Lia asked her about Dorothy  too late because he was dead.  It is a tragic love story and finishing with the song The Tennessee Waltz gives the listener a perfect moment to feel everything.  I have never finished that episode without tears and I just cant picture a tv show hitting that perfect note without some kind of visual display which would distract from the mood.I wish the guys the best in whatever they do but I cant help but feel kinda like we their audience have been used as a stepping stone to bigger things and now we arent important anymore.  We have as much of a right to be upset over this as Firefly viewers were when it was axed.The well get back to you eventually but it will be a while is about as satisfying as hearing Ill call you sometime after a night of great sex.,limetown,d2abu2w,14,t5_39exm
