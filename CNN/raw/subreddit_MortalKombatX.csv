3670974,0,t3_32cnp3,Cassie Cage has a similar playstyle to Johnny Cage but has less range. She has a handgun attack though which eliminates that weakness. She has a few brutal combos but ideally you want to get in do some damage and back off.DVorah is pretty good at most ranges. She has a few attacks which set her up for uppercuts juggles and she has a pretty brutal throw which does decent damage.Lui Kang  not played as him very much but in his Flaming Fist variant hes pretty brutal. The CPU combod me for something like  health from a blocked Sub Zero slide and just juggled me to hell. Is as strong as hes always been.I havent played much as Mileena yet sorry.Ideally in MK youll want to play as a character you a like and b can pull off their special moves and combos with at least some degree of consistency. For me its always been Johnny Cage and SZ as I like their juggles and ranged attacks. Theyve also got great incapacitation JC has the nutcracker  YouTube that and SZ can freeze opponents in a number of ways.,MortalKombatX,cqapr27,1,t5_31yn0
3694585,0,t3_32pg6w,as of right now from my own experience is because when it comes to raiden Ive personally seen that scorpion is a very easy character to use to counter raiden so that might be all if you like raiden and dont want people to keep changing my suggestion is switch characters or even variations the best character to sub raiden for maybe takedalasher ,MortalKombatX,cqdeo54,1,t5_31yn0

3751129,0,t1_cqjgm5i,This is true. Hardly seems fair with someone like DVorah though as she has the extended arm thing. So if she hits a block she can recovery quite quickly or well i feel that way,MortalKombatX,cqjus1m,1,t5_31yn0

3761786,0,t3_33hz04,I have similar specs as you. The only level that I see the pixelation issues you describe are on the snow forest one. It started when the last large patch came out. I have not experienced any crashes while playing though. I know its kind of a crap solution but have you tried deleting and reinstalling the game? ,MortalKombatX,cql2lbj,1,t5_31yn0
3783357,0,t3_33plwb,I also thought it was weird. I just assumed after you beat them they become unlocked like shinok. I am loving MKX but it feels like were missing a ton of fighters.

4659996,0,t1_cthty1x,It really depends I find that SF online is a totally different game than SF local matches.  Playing SF online can feel like you are playing underwater at times but playing locally with your friends is awesome and far more fun than MK which I agree is stiff feeling and Im not a fan of MK dialacombos either.The story modes in MK and MKX are really worth playing though and SF never bothers to have any real ingame story.The input motions for SF are a bit more transferable to other games than MK in my opinion too.If you want to get a game and be winning online honestly both of them are going to be frustrating and take a lot of time on your part before you win consistently.  All fighting games are way better in person.  I am fairly good at SF and MK in person but online its just shenanigans and lag.  USF also has  characters which can take a long time to learn the matchups or learn stuff like how to escape frame traps characters with vortex loops etc.   Mortal Kombat X has its own bullshit  situations where you have to guess right over and over to escape which I think are worse than any shenanigans in USF.  NRS also keeps patching and changing the characters all the time which drives people nuts when they invest in a character.Overall even though Im in a MK subreddit and people might not like this my opinion is USF is more worthwhile than MKX even though it can be tough to win online in USF after you get to about B ranked.If you want to have fun and play some fighters that have barely any lag and use GGPO for netcode you might want to check out fightcade.com and play some older arcade fighting games like Samurai Shodown or SF Alpha  or SF Third Strike.,MortalKombatX,cthy6p2,1,t5_31yn0

9424997,0,t3_59kw1e,Watch sonicfox play him because hes one of the best Errons in my opinion. His low overhead startup just got nerfed  its slower now  but I think he can still be op. Remember to throw caltrops and poke in between long combos. When you play marksman he has some pretty tricky wall combos that involves a lot of good timing to keep the juggle going but you can take out huge chunks of health. But I suggest watching sonicfoxother Erron pro players thats how I got better at my main,MortalKombatX,d9aolwa,1,t5_31yn0

It uses GGPO netcode now which is really good as long as both players have a stable connection arent too far away and use a wired connection.,MortalKombatX,ddgcdwv,1,t5_31yn0
