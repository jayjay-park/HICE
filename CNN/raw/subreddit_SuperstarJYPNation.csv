For those who want the math     hours gt  minutes gt  headphones  that you start with   headphones excluding the ones you get for completing challengesAssuming you grind out  RP per song      RP at minimum Lets say challenges appear every  songs  times in total granting you    RP on average youll get extra RP     depends on your luck   With the headphones you get from clearing challenges thats easily another few thousand RP.You can potentially hoard up  RP if you play hardcore in that  hours. So grind away we need more people to invade Teas million RP club. although youll probably have  million by the end of the event,SuperstarJYPNation,d64w2wt,3,t5_3f9g8
