1637140,0,t3_2cy78q,My suggestion would be to hold on to your current job and on the side join a site similar to Envato Studio maybe Elance or hell even something like Model Meyham and try and get some freelance jobs and see how you do. From there build a portfolio on behance of paid work. When you dont get paid work make up your own projects with great behind the scenes gifs or videos. Call them studies and post them as well.I lucked out and was able to transition from my design job to retouching within the same company years ago but I know thats unusual. Most of my career has been unorthodox so Im not the best at giving advice but I think if you sort of just dive in to the field as a freelancer and build a portfolio is the best way. Thanks for reaching out though I hope this helps a little. Could you post any of your manipulations?Edit Also if you find any of the artists on here that you really like and live in your area shoot them an email and tell them you like there work  try and buy them a beer and just talk. ,retouching,cjliye6,1,t5_2xxpe

3972907,0,t1_cr93kj7,muck around in photoshop look at youtube tutorials make funny faces. Lots of these masters started out by making funny faces.Photoshop are sets of tools. It is not realistic to learn them all as there are so many. Start with the basics. Each tool has a specific purpose. Learn these tools and know what they do. Most masters dont even use more than  of them. There are too many combinations to really know it all.For example something as simple as sharpening an image can have many techniques by combining tool usage,retouching,cr957s4,2,t5_2xxpe
