2242462,0,t3_2kt1tt,Ill be honest Im of the opinion that theres almost nothing left to be said about the nude form and its generally now the realm of cheap titillation passed off as art. Id love to be proven wrong but unfortunately the very few images I can preview only show a woman undressing while mainly maintaining a classic S curve. Im sure youre a competent photographer and I certainly wouldnt want to discourage you from pursuing something that you enjoy but I would possibly suggest thinking a bit deeper on the reason youre shooting nudes. Be critical of the concepts youre proposing and dont use excuses to justify them. If you just like naked women thats fine but dont trick yourself into making up reasons why that alone is a form of artistic expression.,FineArtPhoto,clovc0y,1,t5_2xzdg
