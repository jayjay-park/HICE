3051450,0,t3_2v3rqr,TLDR WatchRooms will be back. Streaming is more up in the air. Also we spent six months making creator tools that make using YouTube easier than YouTube makes using YouTube. It wasnt easy.Thanks for checking in on us!gt I see you guys have reimplemented channels with series that are synced with YouTube playlists. Its good and Im glad I can set at what state a series is in In progress Hiatus Completed.Cool. Glad you like it friend. Its something were actively working on but its coming together quite nicely.gtHowever what happened to Watchrooms? They will be back but only after a significant refactor to get them more in alignment with the current channeldriven focus youre seeing now. Were integrating watchroom functionality into the channel itself. This is more Twitchlike in that if youre doing a watchroom someone can go to  and see it there. Basically were integrating watchrooms into channels instead of having them be their own standalone thing. gt And finally whats the status on streaming?Based on how we built our WatchRooms we get live streaming essentially for free. We needed a live streaming architecture to handle the streaming of webcam audiovideo at large scale. It turns out that can support game streaming pretty well too. However we do not want to be labelled as a streaming platform. Twitch does a great job of that and well never ever be able to handle live streaming at their capacity without millions upon millions of dollars of investment and many many hours of hard work. Will streaming be around when the WatchRooms come back? Maybe. Will streaming ever be something we actively promote and attempt to scale to Twitchhitbox size?...thats a very strong probably not. There may be a place for it on GameWisp as a more niche service but only time will tell.And heres a bonus question you didnt ask. gtWhat exactly are you guys up to anyways? Why are you changing things?TLDR If you didnt find it on the site already heres a marketingheavy page that talks about what were doing nowadays Complete with video.When we initially launched GameWisp back around March of  creators were drawn to the idea of providing some alternative to YouTube that could  coexist alongside YouTube serve as another revenue source Make their lives easier and save them time This is something we always wanted to build but couldnt do it justice until we had the resources to really focus on it. So thats what weve been up to the last six months or so. We built an entire suite of tools that allows content creators to upload videos and serve them on GameWisp ad free in a premiumearly access fashion. Then automatically deploy those videos to YouTube placed in the proper youtube playlist with the correct cover art description tags etc. If you messed with the Series Manager at all on your GameWisp channel you may have noticed some references to things like a push to youtube default etc. These options are all related to that functionality. Were scaling it slowly however so you have to request access to those tools at this point. You can request that functionality under the Insider Program page located on your Channel Dashboard.The ability to upload video to us and serve it early accesspremium to your fans is currently called the Insider Program. Your fans can pay a price you set above a certain minimum to cover our costs to automatically receive your videos early andor exclusively. Basically it takes a large portion of the work out of fan funding. As a content creator that may not be something youre into. Thats fine. Im simply relating to you the business portion of what we do at the moment.If you want to see what the Insider Program looks like from the viewer perspective were currently very quietly testing the Insider Program with one channel on GameWisp GeekRemix If youre interested I can PM you a promo code so you can get an idea of what video content served from our servers looks like for a viewer.,gamewisp,coea4j4,2,t5_30mhy
