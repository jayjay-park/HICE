If you cant then dont focus your application around STEM.EDIT was meant to be a comment reply on mobile.,Emory,cypmjd4,1,t5_2rscc

Thats what I did my second semester senior year when I was busy with other things. I would just do  Tuesday night shifts because nothing ever happens at night really. The thing about bio classes is that they were all pretty general. In PA school everything is really specific so having a good base helps but the information is so much different its a little tricky. Anatomy and Physiology is definitely going to be the most helpful. But when I was there graduated in  they only offered physiology in the college if you wanted to take Anatomy and Physiology you had to go through the nursing school which required some extra permission. Shockingly the most useful classes for me so far have been my neuroscience classes. Theres a huge section in anatomy that is just about the brain nerves etc and that all got covered pretty well by the basic neuroanatomy and behavior classes. Plus well have an entire class dedicated to neurology at some point so I can imagine that will be helpful with an already established background. Definitely try and take some neuro classes and any psych classes you can. There are a lot of fun random bio classes too. I took one on the eye a whole class on just the eyes and how they work and thats really really helpful for PA school now.  Pretty sure you could use neuro classes and any psych ones to fulfil some degree requirements towards the bio degre.,Emory,dg2329w,1,t5_2rscc
