Diaz is kind of your man on the ground full of slang and the sludge of the street whereas Llosa is the man at the top a very measured powerful writer.  The characters themselves are reflections of the different voices.  It would make an excellent pointcounterpoint paper.This week after all of the namedropping about the Mirabal sisters Ill be reading Julia Alvarezs In The Time of the Butterflies.and of course cheering the Broncos  ,52book,ceti9y3,11,t5_2s935

As a woman Im not a huge fan of the way he portrays women but I think that as I am learning more about the characters its getting better.I began the third book in The Wheel of Time but Im not terribly far  maybe  pages. That being said I think that I need to break up the series a bit more. Ive also started the American Gods audio book which I am listening to on youtube heh.

I read a couple of Agatha Christies   From Paddington After the Funeral Murder at the Vicarage and Peril at End House.I also read one of the few Stephen Kings I hadnt read yet Cujo. I had never really been that interested  I love dogs so the idea of one as the big bad never seemed like something Id enjoy. But I decided to give it a try. ....I really didnt like this book. I think I got the symbolism Stephen King was going for in it  Cujo goes rabid amidst a backdrop of failing marriages and homelives Cujo is clearly about that supposedly safe domestic thing you put all your faith into going bad and hurting you. But somehow I just couldnt like the story. I dont know if it was my own mood or my feeling sorry for the poor dog or that a mad St. Bernard seems pretty mundane in the face of a haunted killer hotel a town full of vampires or the Walkin Dude and the Super Flu. It took me a long time to finally read Cujo but Im not really glad I did.,52book,cf5cdy4,9,t5_2s935

Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer  Liked it but I get the feeling that this trilogy should have been just one book. There was just not enough meat in this book but it did make me want to pick up the rest of them at a later date. Trigger Warning by Neil Gaiman  Really liked it. Some of the stories are soso but a lot of them were really great.  The Strange Library by Haruki Murakami  Liked it. Short sweet. Wolf Winter by Cecilia Eckback  Liked it but I was a bit thrown off by the climax. Its not at all what I thought was coming. Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel  Loved this. The setting the characters and even the abrupt climax  this book is right up my alley. Redeployment by Phil Klay  Really liked it.

The book is about a family that lives in Yosemite illegally. It was a recommendation and going in I thought it would be nonfiction. Sadly it is a fiction book.

Agnes Grey was way better in my opinion. Perhaps not as good as Jane Eyre but definitely something I enjoyed reading. The fact that Im a teacher who sometimes feels two steps from being a governess definitely made a lot of the story resonate more.I read Candide and Zadig by Voltaire.

Cant wait for the movie.  The Long Walk by King. I think this is my favorite King book that Ive read so far. I was extremely emotionally invested. Perhaps his best work but Im gonna try .. soon so we will see.  Cats Cradle by Vonnegut. This was my first Vonnegut. I really really liked it. It had a lot of wisdom and got quite a few laughs out of me.  The Strange Library by Murakami. This was my first Murakami and I absolutely loved it. I know its a bit different from his other works but I will definitely be looking to read some of his other novels.  The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Adams. Looooved it. I think this is probably the second funniest book Ive read closely behind Good Omens. Will definitely read further in the series.    Currently Reading  The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman.

Im ready for something light after all of these lengthy fairly dark novels Ive been reading lately! It also might be time to finally dig into The Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler especially since the coworker who recommended her to me might be quitting soon. Im at  books out of my goal of  so far so Im in pretty good shape assuming I dont totally forget to keep reading anytime soon!

4331214,0,t3_3alos8,I felt like the pressure was off after completing my goal last week of . I was able to read  this week. I started off by bulldozing my way through N W by Zadie Smith. White Teeth was one of my favourite books Ive read this year so Im probably unfairly comparing the two. I did enjoy N W but it was definitely harder for me to get through. Until I got to Part Three  then I couldnt put it down. I really fell in love with Keisha at this point and whilst I got the ending of the novel totally wrong I did end up enjoying the book. I then moved on to finish Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J K Rowling. I didnt read the series when I was younger and I think this possibly explains why Im not as enthralled as a lot of other readers. I did enjoy the final instalment especially the tale with the three brothers. It was well paced and had lighter moments to counter the war.  Finally I read The Almost Moon by Alice Sebold. I wanted to love this book because The Lovely Bones is my favourite book from my adolescence. The Almost Moon however was really not my cup of tea. I felt no guilt for Helen instead I found her irritating and slightly aggravating. The concept was intriguing but I think it was poorly executed. This week I have FINALLY got my hands on a copy of All the Lights We Cannot See by Anthony Doeerr a  month wait from the library! so my main priority is to finish it. If I have time I might also give The Giver by Lois Lowry a shot as well. ,52book,csduv9n,4,t5_2s935

My wife loved it and I liked the idea of reading a book with lots of references to fanfiction Harry Potter fanfiction was certainly part of my teenage years. I liked Fangirl because of how welldrawn all the characters were. I also liked reading a book set in a nonmajor city Lincoln Nebraska in this case. I wish Levi or someone had said Cather Avery?

6417289,0,t3_43jkqh,i actually finished an audiobook and a real life physical book this week which is a bit of a happy accomplishment.  I didnt have a lot of time with a lot of textbook reading which I suppose will eventually count as a completed book but I did manage to get my first fiction book of the year out of the way as well as finish my second Tudor audiobook while also doing a little reading of my other books.I completed Station Eleven which I loved.  It was an easy read with a great premise.  Im happy I took the time for this.  I dont read many fiction books so I always take a gamble trying a new author.  But part of my goals with my personal  week challenge is to try new authors and new topics and this certainly qualified for both.  About  of this subreddit has read it already so Im doubting my review will sell many additional copies but if youre in the other  Id recommend checking it out.I also completed the audiobook of The Children of Henry VIII because Im randomly into English monarchs right now apparently and specifically the Tudors.  This is the follow up book to The Six Wives of Henry VIII and while Id recommend Children Id only recommend it if youve readlistened to excellent Six Wives.  Children is mostly about Queen Mary with the first part of the book about Edward iV with little real reference to Elizabeth.  As I said last week the kids arent as exciting as the parents.The author apparently saved Elizabeth for The Life of Elizabeth I which Im listening to now.  Its a different narrator than the previous two books and Im not as much as fan of the reading Im fine when shes narrating but not enjoying the acting she does whenever she reads quotations.  This book is entirely about Elizabeth and seems to be a third book in a trilogy by Allison Weir.Also reading But Enough About Me by Burt Reynolds.  Now this is completely unlike me  I know nothing of Burt Reynolds nor really have an interest  but Ive really gotten into a well written celebrity memoir recently even by people I dont know much about.  Two of my favorite reads of   Not My Fathers Son by Alan Cumming and Unfaithful Music and Disappearing Ink by Elvis Costello  were celebrity memoirs by people I didnt know much about.  So Reynolds was recommended to me based on the above ... and its not very good.  Im about a third of the way complete but dont like the basic writing style nor the narrative at all and wouldnt recommend it at this point.Still reading Destiny and Power.  Slowly but surely ...Im still looking for a new fiction recommendation.  I have no clue just yet since I dont have anything on my toread pile.EDIT  Clarifying should read over what I write before publishing.,52book,czj2x7r,6,t5_2s935

Im currently waiting for Reunion in Death and Purity in Death to come in and Ive got a list of stand alone fantasy novels I plan on checking out soon. My main reading goal for the year is to read all the In Death books that are currently published in order. They are currently in transit so will likely come tomorrow or Thursday at the latest. Ill likely finish them both within a week as that has been my standard. I tend to read multiple books at the same time because Im not the greatest at always remembering to bring the same book with me whenever I go some where. I also would love to try and read through all the books I currently own before the end of the year minus the text books this time around.

7764095,0,t3_4lk88p,This week I finished Tricked Iron Druid book  by Kevin Hearne and while I enjoyed this one a lot more than I did book three I still think Im probably done with the series.  The reviews Ive read seem to indicate that from book five onwards the series seems to take all the things about book three I disliked and doubles down on them.  Also Atticus himself is beginning to grate on me I found him fairly charming in the first two books but he is becoming less so as the series goes on.  Overall Tricked gets a  out of  and the rest of the series gets thrown on the probably wont read pile.I also read Fire Touched Mercy Thompson book  by Patricia Briggs and I loved it.  I ended up reading it in one sitting it was fantastic but without taking anything away from what I just said it was also a bit lacking in substance plot wise after I finished it and was thinking about it I kind of realised not much actually happened.  Now I love the characters in the Mercy Thompson series and would probably read about their adventures doing household chores so to me its not that big a deal but yeah not really sure it felt like a full novel it felt more like the plot of Fire Touched could have been covered in a short story.  Still like I said I loved it so it still gets a  out of  from me cant wait for the next one.I started reading Johannes Cabal The Necromancer by Jonathan L. Howard and while Im only about  to  pages into the book Im not loving it I dont really like the main character at all.  Im thinking I probably wont go back to it at least for now the series did come highly recommended by a few people whose recommendations I normally trust so I might give it another go at some stage but right now Im just not in the mood to read something where I dont like the protagonist.Im thinking of picking up the first Jill Kismet book Night Shift by Lilith Saintcrow next but havent decided  yet.,52book,d3optcb,5,t5_2s935

10219515,0,t3_5maaj0,To paraphrase the words of graphic novelist and creative project guru Jessica Abel Too many projects means you have no projects. As applied to something like a reading challenge you have to either be willing to sacrifice something like campus groups or sacrifice reading and while you can technically read and attend some campus groups its not likely that youll really do either satisfactorily. Set for yourself a clear priority is it reading? Or is it being part of a community or several? Whichever it is that should be your focus instead of spreading your attention too thin over multiple obligations. And to be clear nobody will judge you for choosing one over the other. Its totally your choice what you do but you have to be honest with yourself as to what youre willing to accept at the end of the day.,52book,dc2fu4h,5,t5_2s935

10437295,0,t3_5pg28r,Last week I went through Sebastien De Castells first two novels in his Greatcoat series Traitors Blade and Knights Shadow. Ive heard the series described as The Three Musketeers meets The Lies of Locke Lamora while that doesnt really describe the contents of the books it fairly well captures the tone. Falcio val Mond and his closest friends Brasti and Kest are Greatcoats members of a an elite order of traveling magistrates and master duelists that were were disbanded when their benevolent king was overthrown by a coalition of the corrupt nobility. The common people they were meant to protect now disdain them the nobles they were meant to protect the common folk from despise them and the country is coming apart at the seams and on the brink of civil war. Then things start getting unpleasant...De Castell chose an interesting place to start the story. For all effects the bad guys have already won and the good guys are trying to survive in the aftermath with nothing but the strength of their ideals and their wits to carry them through. And they are witty the humor in the story is one of the main strong points and goes a long way to keeping the tone from being too grimdark. The action is also great De Castell has apparently made a study of rapier fencing himself and writes gripping informed fight scenes. Really enjoyed this one a lot only decided to take a break before moving on to the next book because Id been getting overexposed to the writing style and familiarity would have begun to breed contempt if Id kept on. So instead I segued into James A. Moores Seven Forges. It concerns an explorer Merros Dulver from whats called the Fellein Empire commissioned to lead an expedition into the Blasted Lands the remains of a millennium old magical cataclysm and there encountering a previously unknown race known as the SaBa Taalor. Theyre a martial culture with strange physiological adaptations to their environment and direct contact with the gods they worship and did I mention they are a martial culture? When they send emissaries back with Merross caravan it seems inevitable a conflict will result eventually and one would expect it would go poorly for the Felleins.This was an interesting read Moore made good use of multiple PoV characters and kept the plot moving just fast enough I couldnt complain about the pace being slow. He introduces a lot of mysteries and looking for the answers kept me reading. If I had to complain though Id say that the Fellein Empire was really overshadowed by the Saba Taalor. Its just a generic lowmagic preindustrial human empire nothing really to set it apart from the default kingdom in any human focused DampD game Ive ever played that seems to exist just to be familiar in contrast to the exotic Saba Taalor. The characters who call it home are intriguing but as a setting it doesnt make much of an impression. I suspect this will change in later books Ive already encountered vague spoilers about how the second and third books will progress but in this installment the Saba Taalor really stole the show. Still jumped directly into The Blasted Lands to continue the series though I want to know why the SaBa Taalor are wearing those veils and I will find out. After I wrap that up if I start getting burned out I can switch back with the next Greatcoats installment. And I still have not finished Catcher in the Rye.,52book,dcr5149,4,t5_2s935

10533227,0,t3_5qsxpk,I finally finished The Idiot by Dostoyevsky after reading it in small portions for about three weeks. The story is a slow unraveling of a cast of society characters in St. Petersburg Russia and how badly they behave  Theyre greedy selfish egotistical childish and always quite dramatic. In the center of it all is Prince Myshkin  the Idiot  who was patient and goodnatured but always demeaned and easily taken advantage of by others. There were several awesome insults in this book that you knew Dostoyevsky directed toward society as a whole. My favorite was one about a characters profound unoriginality and commonplaceness not the smallest idea of your own will ever take shape in your heart or your mind. But you are infinitely envious you are firmly persuaded that you are a great genius.  Earlier the narratorDostoyevsky addressed the reader to say something similar about how there are no longer any practical or original people and that societys intelligence has dulled. These were my favorite parts of the book because they were a good coordination to what the author felt about reallife society and then instilled among his fictional characters behavior.Im still reading SPQR by Mary Beard and I love it.

The section on resistance was also pretty sobering. An excellent book.

10887666,0,t3_5uxcd7,I finished Revolutionary Russia by Orlando Figes and cannot suggest it enough! Its a great overview of the Russian Revolution through the theory that the revolution lasted . Theres enough historical analysiscomparison to make it highly educational and the narrative is thrilling to read.  I also slid in Rebuilding Russia by Aleksander Solzhenitsyn to cap off my Russian Revolution books.  It was...mindblowing.  I cant believe that I had never read it in all of the political history and philosophy classes Ive taken! Its a brilliant synthesis of political philosophy especially when it comes to democracy written by Solzhenitsyn in  when Russia was about to start the struggle of looking to implement democracy.  So many passages were eerily prescient with regard to the  election that I need to recommend it to anyone and everyone! Now Im on a fiction break before heading back to Russia in the middle of Out Stealing Horses by Per Petterson. My boyfriends grandma sent it to me and the language of the first few pages really annoyed me short jolting sentences but its definitely picked up and reminds me of a shorter more stoic verion of My Struggle by Karl Ove Knausgaard with not only the setting but the fatherson relationship a loner child and a jumping back and forth between childhood and present.

10945372,0,t3_5wbtsb,I began this week with Perfume by Patrick Sskind. I really enjoyed the first half of the book but felt that the story kind of dragged in the second half. Ive since read that the story is an allegory for the rise to power of the Nazis in Germany which makes sense.Next up was Missing Man by Barry Meier about retired FBI agent Robert Levinson who disappeared in Iran  years ago whilst working for the CIA. I wasnt too familiar with Levinsons case but Meier does an excellent job uncovering the events leading up to Levinsons disappearance and the woeful response by all government agencies. I couldnt put the book down and finished it in a day.Final book this week was Im Thinking of Ending Things by Iain Reid. Good but not great. Decent psychological thriller but I guessed the ending quite early on. That was book number  of the year for me and Ive got to say Im pretty chuffed with that.

I have two hours left and Ive loved just about every minute.

Guns by Stephen King   Interesting essay on the topic of guns Underground Airlines by Ben H. Winters   Fantastic althistory modern thriller set in a US where the civil war never happened and slavery is still legal in the south following someone who is a runaway slave catcher basically.  Baltimore The Plague Ships by Christopher Golden amp Mike Mignola   My main complaint was this was too short and split between backstorycurrent so it didnt really have much to it but otherwise love the premise and reminded me a bit of Penny Dreadful so I need to read more of the series to see if the story dives in more. The Paper Magician by Charlie N. Holmberg   A whimsical magic schoolapprenticeship story reminded me a lot of Harry Potter if it had a female protagonist and more focus on the learning magic aspects. The Last Girl by Joe Hart   A more actionthriller take on The Handmaids Tale as far as Im concerned liked it.  Norse Mythology by Neil Gaiman   Absolutely perfect.

11419029,0,t3_6303kz,Finished  How Paris Became Paris by Joan DeJean .  A history of how certain parts of Paris Pont Neuf Place des Voges etc came to be. It focused on the period between Henry IV and Louis XIV. I wished it had covered the changes under Haussmann in the same detail but it got sloughed off to the afterword. A History of the Third French Republic by CHC Wright.   Its actually a history of the presidency during the Third French Republic written by someone who apparently lived through the times and had strong opinions about certain figures. The writing was lively enough with some wonderful bits of snark but I know enough about the period to wonder why there was a lot of events that didnt come up. A Short History of the French People by Paul Lacombe.   This was much more A Treatise on Power Relations Using Examples from French History. It had some powerful thoughts on the purpose and power of government and the justice and necessity of the republican form of it.
