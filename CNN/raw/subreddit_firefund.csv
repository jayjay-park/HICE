In general it is better with a lower goal because its better to succeed with   than fail with  . But I will definitely work with my team on a model than can do both direct donations and pledged donations. Its obvious that a lot of people just want to donate directly no matter what everyone else do. ,firefund,cu8h4ri,6,t5_36vcu

The success of campaigns such as these are entirely based on trust  not just the trust that the money will not be ripped off but also the trust that the people running probably know what they are doing so that the credit card information does not one day end up in the wrong hands. That is why the question who is firefund and why should I trust them is important to address somehow.From what I recall it also took some time before the campaign had proper endorsements and IIRC I held back donating until later due to that. In such campaigns you often only get one pitch to most people. There should have been recognizable names backing it on the campaign page from the first day.,firefund,cubxtsd,3,t5_36vcu
