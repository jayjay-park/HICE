2154425,0,t1_cldmlmv,Right but how is this different than from what I said besides that your post has more details which the OP did not ask for?But yeah I agree with you FXGuides articles on new technologies and research papers are often incorrect and they miss a lot of the details. Geometry isnt the most important issue but it certainly is possible to have so many models in a scene that fully subdividing everything is possible using breadthfirst ray tracing definitely amortizes the geometry cache misses which allows for significantly more geometry in a scene which reduces the amount of time artists have to spend preparing shots. I dont know the numbers but it is definitely possible that San Fransokyo is too large to fully fit in memory.The research paper itself indeed only mentions using breadthfirst ray tracing to reduce the amount of texture cache misses and to be able to significantly speed up Ptex although the issues with Ptex are not specifically mentioned. ,computergraphics,cldocli,1,t5_2qhxp

2526232,0,t1_cmo9jwj,Honestly I think that companies response is a major overreaction and while I understand why the reaction makes you think twice I would just try to write them off as a bunch of idiots.I look at this guys portfolio and see some great diversity in both realistic d and stylized and between d and d  both great attributes.The other thing is that more and more companies are using zbrush in lowpoly work. Its converting to a WOW pipeline which is using high to midpoly zbrush sculpts to bake out lighting Bent normals AO cavity and Vertex colors and then using them to texture the models vs. the old workflow which is about handpainting.I do a lot of freelance and even mobile games are using this workflow now I havent seen many companies using a nonsculpt workflow unless the style is purposefully flat.But thats just my opinion.I definitely wouldnt split things into more sections.Only crit on the portfolio is that the spider motorcycle is the weakest piece and it was the only zit on an otherwise clean presentation I would highly suggest removing it.,computergraphics,cmobd1s,3,t5_2qhxp

5508095,0,t1_cwfatjw,gt I mean on current pcs you can do crazy things like raytrace game in realtime on CPUPlease give an example for this? Direct lighting only doesnt count since that looks worse than current rendering methods. The example must have at least a couple bounces and look similar to current engines. That quake raytracing demo from a while back is definitely not good enough.Using the GPU as uLPCVOID said the leading tracer is the Brigade path tracer not plain raytracing. That does not run in realtime at HD resolutions only looks like it by updating the frame buffer even if the frame hasnt finished being rendering yet thats why you get the noise. Its certainly catching up however Im yet to see any games with lots of different skeletal animation using it there was this one game with it but not many things moved.The main problem is that they are making a game Im assuming they have lots of coders under lots of pressure to implement features as fast as they can. If we had all the time and money in the world certainly it shouldnt be a problem however they have to cut corners somewhere to get the game out.,computergraphics,cwfpk0h,7,t5_2qhxp

If I had to be critical of anything it would probably be the wood in the secondthird shot maybe the yellowness is a bit much for the all grey scene. The trees look awesome maybe their movement is slightly unrealistic but hardly. All of your texturing is seriously fantastic I really admire your attention to detail. The whole thing really felt like The Third amp The Seventh by Alex Roman which is great.I cant imagine your render times though did you use a render farm?

The ones Im thinking about are only available through Plural Sight which is a subscription service.  I think a month of unlimited access is around .  Trust me though youll get a your moneys worth.  The first tutorial uses a free modeling tool called Fusion  which will change your life and the second covers converting the high poly model from the first tutorial into a fully textured game rez model.  The second tutorial uses zbrush xnormal photoshop quixel suite and marmoset.  It might sound like a lot but itll get you where you want to go.

9731525,0,t3_5ehtm3,Our studio more like the one i work at right now is  Maxwell. It was a cheaper alternative to vrayarnold and we do spend a lot less time debugging scenes here are the pros and cons IMO we use maxwell with maya so variations may apply to RhinoPros Amazing quality in terms of shading and lighting Eats up huge scenes without any problems Very reliable no GI flicking NaN problems Ability to stop and restart renders to make it better what maxwell calls SLs which means you get a fairly good initial idea of how it will look Good IPR Maxwell FIRE Cinemalike camera language ISO Frame Shutters Fairly good documentation  Easy layered shading system really good looking metals  online library of shaders free to useCons Slow as fuck. Yes. Theyve just put out a GPU accelerated version but results arent exactly similar. So you need beefy CPUs and its going to cost you a lot of cycles No procedural shading inside maya  Maxwell studio the standalone application has a few procedural shaders which means you need to UV and texture everything Hugeass files if you use the ability to start and stop your renders Cinemalike camera language. Sometimes its a pain. Shitty IDs AOVs are nice but you cant do IDs like in vray for instance Hardimpossible to do NPR rendering no surface shadersolid color Again really slow especially if you have SSS FFSWe have a good relationship with the Maxwell crew whos sister company works on Realflow. Theyre a smallish crew but ambitious.Proof of the pudding is in the eating so heres our work If I were to start a company on my own Id look at Redshift first then either vrayarnoldmaxwell.
