9382436,0,t3_55hjzr,If I understand you correctly the answer would be FCP X. It has a system of rangetagging that lets you skim through your content and markup your footage with ratings like Reject and Favorite  and also attach keywords to those ranges that allow you to recall chunks of your content instantly. If you have some familiarity with iMovie it should be a relatively easy set of concepts to learn.One time investment of  to own  no ongoing lifetime rental payments. Powerful enough to edit major films and documentaries with literally tens of thousands of assets to manage.,editing,d95aget,1,t5_2sail
9695148,0,t3_5dlhxy,HOLY i love your work. This is all i could ever dream of doing myself. This is the exact type of videos i want to shootedit in the future. I have a couple of questions if you dont mind. How long did you have to practice in shootingediting to achieve this result? Im just starting out and really looking forward to practice and play around and do something like this in the future. How do you shoot your videos? The videos look incredibly smooth for being handheld but the timelapse i guess is doen with a tripod? I only ever used to do photography and only now im starting out with video. I have a canon d and the most common problem i have is that i cant autofocus mid shot. For some reason i can only focus once before the shot and then i if the distance to my subject changes the shots are all ugly and out of focus. Everything in your video looks incredibly on point.How do you find ideas for your shots? When im out of the streets i tend to film a lot of stuff but then i find trouble connecting the films in a way so that it creates a story. Do you just do a lot of random videos and then they go together like a puzzle or do you already have an idea of what you are going to do? I guess this just comes with practice.Lastly what kind of editing software do you use and what would you recommend to a beginner to do exactly these kind of videos? I have sony vegas pro and im currently just trying to learn it but is there something that is better suiting for me. I am also very interested in doing more heavilyedited videos like thisI fucking loved your video and exactly these kind of things inspire me to do this myself. Thank you in advance!,editing,da84sjq,1,t5_2sail

You should either start learning an industry standard like After Effects or Nuke which are equally difficult to wrap your head around or get something like Hitfilm which I believe is free and does the sort of things you want but I bet it still isnt easy. ,editing,ddx693d,1,t5_2sail
