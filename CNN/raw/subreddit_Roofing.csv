933079,0,t3_24q1vg,without pictures I will recommend calling a pro I recommend calling a roofer  of the time.  Our minimum repair charge is . within  miles . beyond that.  If it is a very localized leak that is obvious from the outside you will be looking at a minimum charge.  Id ask if that covers a certain amount of time and maybe they can clean your gutters or check your flashings in the same minimum.,Roofing,chacgkc,2,t5_2s0ys

2470472,0,t3_2nt2cw,Im not sure how snow loads affect structures elsewhere because where I am its not a concern but around here roofs dont cause structural deficiencies in block walls its rather the other way around. I would give some serious thought to getting the opinion of a structural engineer as to all the underlying causes of your problems before you spend a single dime. You might spend a bunch of money on the roof and end up with the same thing happening in a few years because you didnt fix an underlying structural problem in the foundation or walls.,Roofing,cmh1s9z,1,t5_2s0ys
2740581,0,t3_2rcuft,I would put a vote against painting a shingle roof. Ive seen people do it and never cared for the look of it. Not to mention youre really not improving the roof in any substantial way. A high elastomeric percentage may help reflect UV rays. I couldnt tell you exactly how much of a difference that would even make. Good luck. ,Roofing,cnflcc0,3,t5_2s0ys
3753765,0,t3_33bfdw,The only thing I would look into is do you have vented soffit?  If so then I would highly suggest going to the ridge vent style venting.  It is much better.  If you dont then dont bother with the added expense as youre not going to help yourself adding ridge vent if its not vented at the soffit as well.  Now if you want it done right and they already have the roof tore off then adding a vented soffit piece around the house would be a good investment.  I would also go with the Certainteed shingles over the GAF shingles.,Roofing,cqk5n1c,1,t5_2s0ys

5175918,0,t1_cv9spd9,Thanks for the reply! I shall look up some of those terms in my many roofing books thanks library. The estimate I received does include removing the current builtin gutters and adding real gutters. The area is PNW in the Seattle area.,Roofing,cv9vzor,1,t5_2s0ys

6086374,0,t1_cyhdi71,Its actually on the ground floor I might be able to pull some floorboards up and have a look. Ive logged a claim with my insurance company and have booked  roofing companies for quotes. Unfortunately the insurance assessors wont be available until the th! So Im a little concerned it will get worse if I just leave it. I think Ill keep an eye on it and get the emergency repair done if it gets worse. So far I dont think any real damage has been caused.,Roofing,cyhei7i,1,t5_2s0ys
6159709,0,t1_cypgajk,I think my attic has proper ventilation. It looks like I have gableend and mid roof vents. Im not sure about the soffits. I crawled in as close as I could but couldnt get a good look. Edit Heres a picture of the vents on the roofYou had also asked about the climate. I live on Vancouver Island in British Columbia and it rains a lot in the fallwinter but doesnt get too cold. When I first noticed these wet spots it was during a heavy and windy several day rain storm but wasnt terribly cold probably around C. Then after the rains it got cold and went below zero and then we even got a bit of snow for a couple days but then it all melted. I dont think any really stuck around on the roof for very long though. If it were condensation due to a ventilation problem wouldnt the problem be more widespread as opposed to localized to these separate smallish areas?,Roofing,cypsn9z,1,t5_2s0ys

6615829,0,t1_d00t0u5,Do not go with quote . IKO shingles are garbage.  You will have issues.  The second quote didnt list what manufacture they were offering which is important.  There is no such thing as a lifetime shingle unless you are looking at Slate or EuroShield.  Highly recommend Euroshield!  Even though the rd company didnt bring a ladder they could have pulled an eagle view.  We use them all the time so we do not have to go up and measure the roofs our selves.  You are right on the ice and water shield. Demand that in the valleys.  That is a common practice and anyone using lb felt is just trying to save a little bit of money but setting you up for leaks later in life.Certainteed on quote  is a great product.  You would be happy with that.  A normal price too for rotten decking is around  a board.  ,Roofing,d03msxw,2,t5_2s0ys

7090118,0,t3_4cbiyt,putting a silver coat on an old roof is just kicking the can down the road for a year or two.  its not going to add significant amount of years to the roof depending on the state it is in.  Its better to install them when they are newer,Roofing,d1k17q1,2,t5_2s0ys
