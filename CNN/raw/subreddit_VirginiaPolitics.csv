391270,0,t1_cfl821b,The difference I see is that the Moose Lodge isnt asking to sit in on classes or have lunch in the cafeteria during school hours while this bill proposes an intrusion for lack of a better word into actual school activities.I dont really think its a bad idea to allow homeschooled kids to participate as it gives them exposure to their peers but where do we draw the line? Do the homeschooled kids get to come to prom? Can they get a part in the school play? Use the school library?And if were going allow these kids to join in then where do we draw the line among kids who do go to public school? Can a kid who goes to one school with a sucky football team opt to play for a different school with a good team? ,VirginiaPolitics,cflbkcy,2,t5_2tekq

1048369,0,t1_chnaeue,You mean other than the  congressional elections that Paul won from  to ?  Of course he didnt win the GOP nomination for President but if youve been following the internal politics of the Republican Party in Virginia youd know that his impact inside the GOP cant be ignored.Now as for Sarvis I think theres no doubt that his chances of being elected to a statewide office as a Libertarian border on the nonexistent.  Thats an unfortunate product of the two party duopoly that controls politics in this country but there you have it.  I think whether his election bids will have any sort of influence remains to be seen.  Getting elected isnt the only way to have influence in politics forcing a debate on issues that wouldnt otherwise be debated or pushing the dialogue in a different direction are other ways to make a difference.  Only time will tell whether Sarvis candidacies have that kind of effect.,VirginiaPolitics,chngcyv,3,t5_2tekq
1291511,0,t1_ciewjf4,gt Gov exercises legal veto authorityThats the point thats in dispute.And the potential crisis would be if the Governor went beyond his constitutional authority to spend money that has not been appropriated by the General Assembly.  It starts with his attempted veto which the General Assembly can simply choose to ignore in the enrolled version of the bill.  It only becomes a constitutional crisis if McAuliffe chooses to try to act outside the law by spending money that hes been forbidden by law to spend.,VirginiaPolitics,ciewtsm,2,t5_2tekq

1860192,0,t3_2fuoje,One of my frustrations with Libertarians in Va is their avoidance of running local government candidates.  However most of the government services people use  public safety education roads  most are managed at the local level.  Local funding of development would certainly seem like an issue they could run with.It would provide the party with experienced candidates to run for higher offices and give evidence that their ideas could be effective.,VirginiaPolitics,ckdcj5r,2,t5_2tekq

4595749,1,t1_ct9pufj,Killing children is always a good thing to take a stand against. I dont care if it is  of their business model. I did some research. the  figure is misleading.  of all women that use PP will use it for abortions and PP provides between  and  of ALL abortions yearly in the USA. So this organization is a BFD when it comes to the abortion business. Not to mention it gets a sizable portion of its budget from abortions either from direct grants for it or from mothers paying for them. ,VirginiaPolitics,ct9vwbq,2,t5_2tekq

Never mind that for years public interest groups analysts and I think a couple of my elderly relatives who had some free time have all made recommendations how to better redraw the districts without gerrymandering. But no lets hire this guy from California to come over here sit in a couple meetings tell some of our state employees how to do their job then walk away with a big fat check whether or not the plan is actually successful or not.
