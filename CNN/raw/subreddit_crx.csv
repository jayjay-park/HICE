1987183,0,t3_2hhama,I used to have an  si once. I do remeber wanting to swap the  Integra engine in. The swap will be more difficult for you because you only have a carburetor based engine system.  ,crx,cksnmpv,1,t5_2sfmr
4260846,0,t3_39eh85,Actually I still have my  CRX Si and I love it!!!  To this day I still get notes left on her asking if I want to sell her.  Heck no!!!  Believe me I can afford most cars drove an SL for awhile and the Si gives me a thrill every time I take it out. It might be that I also have a SUV for the family so when I swap to the lightweight Si it seems like it can fly and it does.  Go and pick one up.  Parts are still available and the great thing about this as opposed to my Mercedes back then it is so dependable that you should be able to drive it for a long time without any issues.  Good luck!,crx,cs5wzxo,1,t5_2sfmr
