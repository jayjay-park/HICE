405399,0,t1_cfmkh8r,That can sometimes be true. Still i would have thought that there were a few more profitable CPU only coins around. Its always my opinion that the botnets share of all the hashing power is less than the mining companiesdatacenters share of power in other coins. Id love to see some stats on that though.,MinCoin,cfmsas7,1,t5_2wt92
