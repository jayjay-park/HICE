6883007,0,t3_49wprp,How the hell are you accurately measuring raw LiCl and Setipiprant in mgs?! Do you have a super sensitive scale or something? if so can you direct us towards it? thanksI have a miligram scale. Theres chinese scales that are accurate up to about mg. Personally I own a satorius scale now.,SwissTemples,d0wi6lq,1,t5_3cte2
6883874,0,t3_49wprp,So it is required Seti which seems to be the most safe PGD inhibitor PGE of some sort seems like Castor Oil only activates one of the four receptors so that wont be enough Lithium Chloride or VPA and dermaneedling. And of course keeping with an antiandrogen my case finasteride. Correct?Yes thats correct. An anti androgen isnt needed but if youre not applying the seti to your whole head its better to stay on it than risk losing it.,SwissTemples,d0wlqcq,2,t5_3cte2
7166622,0,t1_d1srlmz,idk I got some  solution off Amazon. Its a chemical that is used by industries in large amounts so its fairly cheap. Bought  liters for  because  liter was  really dont know what to do with the rest now. But it supposed to be good for cleaning electronics. Be careful with the stuff it freezes solid at C and it heats up if you mix it with water. It also started dissolving the finish of my wooden desk.And clean your skin before using it as itll pass anything thats on your skin into your skin.,SwissTemples,d1srz6i,1,t5_3cte2
9800989,0,t1_dakzua4,It works surprisingly well. Even the big  people are not getting as much regrowth as I hear people reporting here. Im not on fin. The whole reason I got interested in alternative treatments was because I dont want to take fin. I believe that DHT might play some important roles in the body beyond puberty and I dont want to mess with it. Also Im too much of a head case to take a drug like that without letting it get to me.,SwissTemples,dal6ll1,1,t5_3cte2
