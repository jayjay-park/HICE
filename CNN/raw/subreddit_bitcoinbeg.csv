371089,0,t1_cfj3m8n,Im aware of this idea. There have been a volumes of basic science studies done on cancer metabolism and a few clinical studies on diet as an adjuvant to treatment. I have a number of colleagues who study cancer metabolism. Its very interesting. I wouldnt be surprised if a ketogenic diet become part of the total treatment strategy for cancer in the future. However more clinical evidence needs to be collected to demonstrate a clear benefit.,bitcoinbeg,cfj88uc,7,t5_2wrwz

376136,0,t1_cfjq0cz,Thanks for the reminder. Unfortunately cause of death due to chemo versus the cancer itself is not tracked so it there can be no way to say one way or the other how many people die from the chemo. What is interesting to note is that most practicing doctors would not put themselves through lifesaving interventions that are big on promises but small on success and involve great pain and distress. If most doctors refuse chemo for themselves then that tells me there may be something wrong with all the talk about how effective chemo is.,bitcoinbeg,cfjr2s3,-1,t5_2wrwz
416574,0,t3_1y6f6x,I am on birth control and it makes me completely lose my sex drive. I had this when I was on the lowest dosage and I think I went up from  to  last year. I dont see any other issues with my body but Im embarrassed to talk to my doctor about it! Should I be changing dosages or is birth control just not for me? I have heard of other women going through this as well. ,bitcoinbeg,cfnxzi2,1,t5_2wrwz
