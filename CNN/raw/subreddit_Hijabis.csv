113761,0,t3_1ve19z,NonMuslim here so please excuse me if I am ignorant so from what I know of Islam many women identify the hijab as both a cultural and communal symbol as well. Has there been much discussion historically regarding whether the hijab is more of a religious or a cultural symbol? I know many times religious symbols and cultural norms go hand in hand so its probably difficult to differentiate. Are there some women who only don the hijab for prayer like some of the Jewish women in this article? ,Hijabis,cerdu87,2,t5_2tgrb
286853,0,t1_cfahoki,I strongly advise her NOT to tell her family if in any way it would be detrimental to her security. If this sister is a teenager for example it isnt uncommon for families to kick kids out of the house for coming out with something like this. Telling your parents is not an easy thing if you still require their assistance in living.My own parents freaked out when I told them I had converted and Im an independent  year old that hasnt lived with my parents for  years. This is something that requires a lot of thought because it could have serious consequences.,Hijabis,cfahvq9,6,t5_2tgrb

1078085,0,t3_26fpeg,As a convert the thought of arranged marriage has crossed my mind so many times. I would have loved to have this opportunity for my family to have been involved. Alas Im in my s now and my parents who have been married amp divorced multiple times are not Muslim and quite frankly dont really care. In fact they discourage me from ever getting married. Ive been told Why get married youll only get divorced and When you get divorced who ends up with your future kids? So I dont even bother talking about marriage with my parents anymore. All I can say is... no one is perfect. If a good man comes your way either through aunties parents or friends... dont write him off because he doesnt fit into all your check boxes. There will eventually come a time when men wont be interested in you anymore because of your age. Its sad but a true reality. ,Hijabis,chqty4s,2,t5_2tgrb

1621429,0,t3_2cstqb,gtI dont feel like Im looking to wear a headscarf for modesty.Hijab has a very specific style and requirements covering all hair and the neck. For practical reasons that often includes the shoulders and cleavage area too.  Since you dont want to cover up for modesty just to make your hair more manageable you got a lot more options available to you. Wraparound turban snood hat Hollywoodstyle wraparound scarf ....Hijab is a religious symbol it is a sign of faith. It makes me uneasy that you want to wear it just because you dont want to deal with your hair. If a nonmuslim wears it for a day as an experiment or because the lawcustom in Saudi or Iran says so that is cool. But a hijabi woman represents Islam and if you effed up unintentionally or not it would reflect badly on all hijabi women out there. For example I dont eat pork. Yet a friend of mine saw a woman with a hijab headscarf eat a pork sausage at a fair. So my friend bought me a sausage and was offended when I refused to eat it. Called me Osama bin Radical and stupid and other kinds of names. I told my friend that the woman in question probably did not even know the sausage was pork. But all my friend could say was she was wearing hijab! If she can eat pork why dont you? Why do you make this so difficult? Everytime we go out you always want it extraspecial because of your stupid Allah. BTW lots of people with hair like yours do well with dreadlocks or small africanstyle braids. Something to think about. ,Hijabis,cjjjowp,5,t5_2tgrb

2750756,0,t3_2rj9li,Meh this article reads like a highschool students rant on tumblr. The fetishization of women covered or not has long occurred and will continue to happen long after Mia Khalifa. Not sure why thats news. Talk about the undercurrents that give rise to these monolithic forces instead. Pornography is all about objectification and power. Its recreational and armchair misogyny its disassociation in a mouse click. Pornography and these sorts of warped fantasies are meant to cultivate a mindset that creates two worlds one where real human interactions take place and another where women are on their knees at the behest of a man. That way women are only people part of the time and objects at others. And then sure go nuts. Treat them like toys and chattle poke and prod abuse and humiliate. And taking a look into the authors background she says that theres sexual repression within Muslim spirituality. Gotta say though that there are books like Ibn Hazms Ring of the Dove and the eyebrowraising poetry of Ibn Arabi and Rumi that would put that argument swiftly to rest. There are definitely cultural influences that foster the taboo but within Islamic scholarship and literature itself? Lol. No. ,Hijabis,cngqzrm,13,t5_2tgrb

He draws long noses sometimes but you could argue that the nose in this phallic and joking at the Prophets expense. Distasteful and vulgar perhaps but these cartoons were never meant to be reverent or clean and they werent about Arabs. Most of their cartoons covered French current affairs so many of them are impossible to understand without context. For example the man sodomized was Dieudonn a French comedian who seemed to defend the Paris gunmen and raised antisemitic salutes if were thinking about the same cartoon.

2961207,0,t3_2tzaq0,ASAJazakAllahu Khayran for sharing this. I just read this ridiculous article about how Michele Obama is so amazing for sticking it to the Arabs at their leaders funeral and I was floored by the ludicrous notion that she is somehow a hero for this disrespectful action. You are so right to point out that this is not a statement on oppression when the US backs KSA and vice versa. It would have been more affective to wear the hijab in solidarity with Muslim women especially after all the stereotypes and bigotry rampant in the world we live in especially in recent times. This is a stigma that Muslim women are oppressed everywhere just for how they dress. This woman and all she stands for really bothers me. She is a hypocrite through and through. Talking on obesity and how parents need to exercise their kids more when your government serves up garbage to the masses through legalizing chemical GMOs made substances to enhance food and basically kill off or zombify generation after generation of your own people speaking against Boko Haram and their killing of girls when US drone strikes take the lives of children everyday giving cause for groups like Boko Haram to even exist and thrive speaking about education while schools in Washington DC and beyond are understaffed underfunded and lack infrastructure literally school buildings are falling apart especially in the inner city. What is this if not hypocrisy?Above all in a misguided effort to promote equality acting just like men in physicality and emotion is actually the very downfall of the female. I believe acting like a man to be just like him and putting him on a pedestal as if he is the perfect specimen of a human being is oppressive. Men are not better than women that we should strive to be just like them we have our own nature and our own God given path in life isnt it time we embraced it? Let him do him and you do you!

6518897,0,t1_cztixr7,You definitely have a point. People are going to take advantage of anything they can if they see a business opportunity. So there is that aspect. And I agree with you on hijab rejecting ideas of beauty standards and who gets to say someone is beautiful and another isnt. And in a perfect world we would all think this way but its just the reality of our current world. IA in the future this will change and so I think this brings me back to a message that I tried to bring across in other posts in this forum education. Even if we do give our kids gendered toys not saying we should because I also dont really agree with it what message we put across and the importance we put on them is vital. Personally I had a few Barbie dolls growing up but my parents never stressed fashion or beauty and always stressed education and knowledge and independence so thats how my sisters and I played with our dolls. Our dolls were either at university or volunteering to help poor stuffed animals or for some reason camping. So my point is the values at home are whats more important here. In a lot of even Muslim homes the value of women is still less if they dont say it outright. People still expect a woman to always fit some idea of beauty whether Muslim or not and not enough emphasis is put on heart intelligence or deen. All ideas start small and grow. We just have to be the ones to nurture those ideas. ,Hijabis,cztlscj,1,t5_2tgrb

Likewise with life saving surgery doctors firefighters etc. You are permitted to reveal what you would otherwise keep hidden if its to protect your health and well being.

I dont think it should be banneddisallowed but I also think that there should be no issue with it being temporarily removed for identification purposes and those who try to get out of doing so are offbase from what Ive read even scholars that DO see it as obligatory acknowledge this as a necessary and acceptable exception. One of my close friends wears one and it works for her and her situation tech field works from home often but with me it would not in education and typically working with ESL students who rely on facial expressionwatching mouths for context and pronunciation clues if that was unavailable it would be detrimental to their learning rather than just an issue of my personal preference. So... basically you do you but do so reasonably and dont get surprisedoffended if youre told its in the way of something its in the way of. Alternate example being going to the doctor  yeah its your right to decide who does and does not see your body but if youre wanting treatment and a visual is needed for diagnostic purposes thats not discriminationoppression. Interestingly though Ive noticed that its BY FAR western converts who get up in arms about exceptions ID photos and verification doctor visits etc. violatin their freedums not just with niqab but hijab as well regardless of how excited you are about it its not a violation of your rights to be required to wear a sports hijab to play soccer rather than the straightpin filled shayla you had imported last week and such reactions rarely come those who are coming from a culture in which it is more commonuncontroversial and will temporarily adjust to the situation and move on rather than draw a ton of attention complaining about something that was arguably quite reasonable. ...I got a bit away from the niqab topic there. It just bothers me when people claim X is the issue when Y is really the issue and peripherally involves X. It makes it that much harder for people to raise actual concerns about X. ,Hijabis,d1urjlu,1,t5_2tgrb

Well in case she didnt answer your questions outside of how long is your hair our hair can still grow pretty long depending of course on geneticsheritage. Its a good idea to use enriching oils or vitamins as an additional source. Also we can take off our hijab at home around immediate family so if theres a private yard at the house then we can certainly get some sunlight there as well   ,Hijabis,d9y85bg,6,t5_2tgrb

10483340,0,t1_dcwbu2s,I dont personally appreciate people that I dont know commenting on my religion and level of spirituality based off of their assumptions of me. If I dont know somebody personally then theyre not speaking from a place of knowledge. For example Ive had someone tell me that I shouldnt be sitting beside or close to my partner at the time in public. I understand that dating is haram and I also understand the implications of putting myself in that situation right? I can see someone pointing me in the right direction and telling me that they think that I shouldnt sit so close it wasnt but that shouldnt be coming from someone I dont know. My partners family was familiar with him and I was told that hes not practicing himself. Thats hypocritical. Another example is a female friend I have hugging her male friend goodbye because she was moving to another country and a random Muslim came up to her and chastised her for doing this. I dont think thats appropriate. Its very easy to point out what other people are doing wrong but whos place is that? If someone is doing something obviously wrong or haram like the vices you mentioned then theyre likely aware of the consequences. What will mentioning it to them do? It just brings shame to them and pushes them further from the Ummah and Allah. I am definitely concerned with the niceties of it and I think theres a tactful and respectful way to approach every topic. I dont however believe that all of these people are necessarily coming from a place where they take enjoyment in telling other people theyre being bad Muslims. I just know from personal experience which is wholly what Im speaking on and from that the people Ive encountered were not in a position to say something to me. Whether thats because I didnt know them vice versa or they themselves participate in things that they Islamically shouldnt. Youre right that theres no way to dispute certain activities but those that participate it on a completely different path for whatever reason. Im not talking about those impermissible activities though. Im speaking about people who would harshly judge or talk on say a woman wearing a looser hijab or a man wearing tight jeans. They might be haya but thats not my place to judge. Thats Allahs. Im not sure if Im conveying everything I want to properly because Im typing this between lectures but let me know if I can further expand or dispel anything. ,Hijabis,dcwe89q,6,t5_2tgrb

10867759,0,t1_de0w4se,Or I speak from a place of personal experience where I learned these lessons firsthand the hard way. As far as parenting goes. I fall more into the Likely to say yes category. It is better to have a open and honest relationship with your children... and to let them demonstrate their independence and reliability. Otherwise you have a kid who runs around lies and you have no idea where they are or what theyre actually doing. ,Hijabis,de0xkhs,4,t5_2tgrb

11184224,0,t3_5znygp,Im assuming youre not a troll because this post is just...idk.gt  But I do not know if that exists. I know that I am a total catch because of the lifestyle I have chosen to live except for my prior relationship but I want someone better than I am. I want my queen. And I really hope she is real.I have a question. Why is it okay for you to disregard that prior relationship  years lol you had and focus on the new lifestyle you have chosen to live but not okay with the woman you want to marry? If a touched woman chose to repent from her sins similar to you why isnt she worthy of you? You made the same mistakes anyways.I dont understand this post at all lol.,Hijabis,dezpw2r,6,t5_2tgrb

11283393,0,t3_6111c7,Sister you are very brave to speak about something that has been such a heavy burden for you. Its only natural that we keep things locked away sometimes sometimes for fear on how it affects us now in the future or even perhaps how it has made us who were are today. I dont know if it may be the same for you but perhaps even ways that things that couldve been different without fear being in the back of your mind constantly. Its only natural to break down when seeing someone who did something to you that hurt you. But I hope you get solace from posting here and opening up about something that I know is hard to speak about at all. ,Hijabis,dfayf49,4,t5_2tgrb
