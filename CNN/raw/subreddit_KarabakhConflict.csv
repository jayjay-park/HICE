7269124,0,t1_d245d5a,That is correct. Armenia did not participate in the recent conflict. azerbaijan has always tried to make this a conflict between Armenia and azerbaijan by completely ignoring Karabakh. Armenia stated they would join the conflict when azerbaijan threatened to attack Stepanakert.gt However the President of Azerbaijan made a clear announcement that Stepanakert would be targeted if Karabagh forces did not withdraw from the disputed territories. In response President Serzh Sargsyan threatened Azerbaijan with retaliatory strikes. He also threatened to recognise Karabaghs independence a move that could have potentially escalated the conflict.By recognizing the independence he stated Armenia would aid Karabakh by sending troops,KarabakhConflict,d24g6yi,3,t5_3dwnu

Do you want Ararat back?Sargsyan Nobody can take it away from us Ararat is in our hearts. In every Armenian home in every corner of the world you will find the image of Mount Ararat. I believe that the time will come when Ararat instead of being the symbol of divide will become the symbol of common understanding between our two nations. However I would like to clarify the following no official in Armenia has ever presented any territorial claims to Turkey. The Turks ascribe such claims to us themselves probably since they have a sense of guilt?And yet azeris and Turks like to claim Armenia is the one who has territorial claims towards our neighbors.  ,KarabakhConflict,d3l4e4a,0,t5_3dwnu

Everything indicates that theres virtually unanimous support for independence and fierce hatred for Azerbaijan among Karabakhi Armenians. Thats not to mention Azerbaijans inane antiArmenian propaganda and stuff like Safarov and the deliberate destruction of Armenian populations and heritage elsewhere in Azerbaijan for which theres been no apology and no regret and which lead to such Orwellian phrases asgtArmenians have never lived in Nakhichevan which has been Azerbaijani land from time immemorial and thats why there are no Armenian cemeteries and monuments and have never been any ...not even getting into the simple fact that if it were true that Armenians would vote for Azerbaijan then Azerbaijan wouldnt have been making an issue of Armenias insistence that a hypothetical binding referendum on legal status would include an independence option.,KarabakhConflict,d9qyf4e,2,t5_3dwnu

You can or cannot agree with the methodology of adding  azerbaijani who were violently deported from Armenia to the sum figure. Simply I dont care your methodology of countint IDPs or refugees. Thats not my point. In any case the number of people affected from conflict is higher in Azerbaijan rather than in Armenia. Thus the bigger victim of the conflict is Azerbaijan. That was my point.

Amusing. I do not have any other comment to it. I reread statement of De Waal but I havent seen something that armenian population of Karabakh faced repressions by Soviet Azerbaijani side. He never wrote azerbaijani side repressed armenians back in soviet times at least I dont remember from my reading Black Garden. He wrote armenian side had several complaints.

Why would they go through all the trouble of constructing the device to take few pictures and not even publicize it much in the end. What can possibly be an objective?I see three possibilities here. Armenians are trying to construct something to weaponize the drones they have but indeed this hardy looks like a professional effort. Azeris made it for propaganda purposes but it is not clear what they were possibly trying to achieve.. A third party in either Armenia or Azerbaijan is trying to use a hobbyist drone fitted with an IED to provoke an escalation. This one is farfetched but interesting to consider.

The Armenian diaspora living in the west factors into the affairs of Armenia even if in the form of soft power. This diaspora cherishes western values and already is pressuring Armenia itself in regards to democratic governance. Their concern is the survival of Armenians in a historically hostile neighborhood. An inclusive liberal democracy in the region would give no reason for advocacy or concern. After all this diaspora has thrived in almost functional liberal democracies.

11357204,0,t1_dfj9ixl,I dont know why you start your comment arguing with me.You make some good points. But note that you actually answer yourself in the first paragraphgt Any genocide acknowledgements will set their relations sour as weve already seen in certain European countries. The only one that Turkey continues to majorly cooperate with is Russia who acknowledged the genocide long ago which is ironic for TurkeyRussia relations. The US could recognize the genocide Turkey will of course have an angry reaction and threaten to cut diplomatic ties etc but perhaps they might have to just deal with it and relations with reestablish between the two countries...In all cases the ambassadors returned no diplomatic or economic ties were severed its just noise and no substance those of us who follow these things know it all too well  Turkey supposedly moving away from the west has nothing to do with the Armenian Genocide. In fact its the other way round the Armenian Genocide recognitions might have something to do with Turkey moving away. The reason for the US resisting recognition probably has to do with treaties related to reparations and the potential damage this could cause to Turkey. Probably the same applies to the UK. These are the two states with common law systems and the two relevant states left still not recognizing the genocide. Turkey is probably liable legally one way or another and that is probably one reason it is fighting recognition. gt There have been numerous other individuals in the likes of Condoleezza Rice whove said similar remarks for other administrations they arent on that list.Im no expert in American politics vis a vis the genocide issue but feel free to give names and Im sure they will add them if they indeed denied or worked against recognition. I dont even know if that list is exhaustive ask armeniapedia. gt  Why not just label the entire US federal government for playing a game of politics brand them all as genocide deniersBut they arent all Genocide deniers. Nor is the US officially denying the genocide. There are only two states which deny the Armenian Genocide Turkey and Azerbaijan the rest either acknowledge or have no official position on it. Germany also recognizes its own role in the genocide. The US federal government does not officially deny the genocide. The US federal government simply has no official position on it. These two things are not the same. As for playing politics all governments and parliaments in the world play politics and all of their resolutions are political statements and are political. This is by definition. There is nothing contradictory here. The US federal government is no different.,KarabakhConflict,dfjbgtu,1,t5_3dwnu
11392951,0,t1_dfnbnsm,gtDo you ever wonder where the huge sums of money the CIA budgets for activities against Iran goes towards?Not really I do know that the CIA did aid as well as the Mossad the Kurdish militant group PJAK which has attacked and is at war with Iran  . They also funded and assisted the Balochi Sunni militant group Jundullah. There has always been a rivalry between Turks and Persians but this isnt between Azeris and Persians Azeris were one of the great forces to fight against the Turks during the Safavid era. Turkish rivalry was focused on the Ottoman Empire and the newly founded Turkish state. The user amirkabir is simply just wrong hes a confused diaspora Iranian with a weak link in identity.Iran has been trying to assimilate and bring Azeris close to their side because they do view the Azeris as a potential threat to their territorial integrity. This is a speech by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei the Supreme Leader   Turks and Fars Persians are one and the same people at the end of the day we are brothers. gtSee you are doing it again  ethnocentrism. If I say that Karabakh belongs to Armenians all users who are supposedly of Azerbaijani origin will jump on my comment. Would you say that Karabakh belongs to Armenians and thus support its independence? I dont recall having read any such thing in your comments Iranian Azerbaijan certainly belongs to the Azeri people it is our historical land and the birthplace of the Azeri people. I never once disputed that Nagorno Karabakh is historically Armenian the difference is that in Iranian Azerbaijan it is inhabited by Azeris  there are some pocket regions of Kurds and ethnic minorities such as Armenians and Assyrians who live between several cities. But the region is Azeri. Nagorno Karabakh was  Armenian but had a large minority population  Azeri I am assuming. The Armenian diaspora in Iranian Azerbaijan was vibrant and open to the public eye but it was negligible in terms of population ratio. There are more Persian migrants in the Azeri regions than Armenians or Assyrians. Please give me your opinion on whether or not you disagree with my statement.gtNo Armenians or Iranians existed there no? Some villages and areas were historically Armenian just like Nakhichevan was. Iranians will come up and say that prior to the Turkification of Iranic peoples throughout the last few centuries that region has always been IranianPersian. So what now?The modern Iranian identity is a recently new one the old Persians who lived in this region spoke what you know as the Azari language. Some of our descendants are individuals like   the Persians living in the Fars region or Khorasan region etc werent the Persians who settled in todays Iranian Azerbaijan it was the Azeris or Azaris before the Turkification. Armenians lived here too as our neighbors my grandmother lived in an Armenian neighborhood for example had very good relations. They lived side by side with us and flourished the region as well but it isnt their native land although it is still their home to us. I think it was the Safavids who deported some Armenians from the Armenian kingdom and brought them to Iran? The Armenian historical homeland is the old land of Hayastan.gtWhat  of population even would be proindepnence? Compare that with the  of population who wanted independence from Karabakh since day  Karabakh was given to Azerbaijan all the way throughout the history of Karabakh under USSR until its independence and until today.The two short lived states that arose from Iranian Azerbaijan was supported by the people before it was quashed by the Iranian military. I would say a decent portion would support independence if it was possible. Iran has made it extremely hard to show dissident or anything so this isnt really something most Azeris dream of or relish to happen its even extremely difficult for Persians to do anything about this current government which is an easier task to do than separate from Iran. gtPogroms by their nature involve civilians. Whether they were government sponsored or not is not relevant. The crackdowns on Azeris of Iran were exclusively government acts as you stated by Basiji IRGC and Shahs henchmen prior  these are not civilians  you will not find ethnic friction where nonAzeris attacked Azeris there is no such thing in Iran in its recent history that I am aware of. There is zero equivalence here between Armenians living in Azerbaijan including Karabakh and Iranian Azerbaijan.Perhaps I was mistaken I agree with your point  and .gtLet me put it this way. I believe you are in the US right? Do you consider yourself AzeriAmerican? If someone were to argue with you that you are not American but you are Azeri. What would you say?Yeah I am in the United States. Id say to that someone that they are silly I was born in the United States but I certainly am of Azeri heritage. gtObviously many disagree with this because they are against the Iranian government and policies and want to separate themselves from the Iranian nationality  and there is nothing wrong with this either.You hit the nail on the head as to why Iranians in the west began calling themselves Persian.gtBeing a Turk can mean many things and right now apparently it can mean being a citizen of Turkey independently of ones ethnicity. Wouldnt you consider this to be a worse encompassing nationality than Iranian? Why we never hear about this from nationalistic Azeris but we hear about Iranian integration of Azeris?The term Iranian is connected to Persian history. Iran meaning land of the Aryans in English. I dont really think its any different to Turks of Kurdish or Armenian history. I agree that anybody born in Turkey is considered a Turk nationality wise but I dont think its a problem to distinguish TurkishKurd or TurkishArmenian? Its funny for the Jews and Arabs in Iran who have to call themselves IranianJews some call them PersianJews or IranianArabs when the country name is land of the Aryans when these people are Semites.gtIranians consider ArmenianIranians as Iranians something which sounds strange to Armenian Iranians even today. But they are right. Iranian is a nonethnic nationality which includes all citizens of Iran. People not liking this which is fair doesnt negate that fact.At least Armenians are IndoEuropean your language is too. Azeris are often looked at as being Turkic which is connected to the Altaic family away from IndoEuropean. The Semites are also in this bandwagon. Iranians often also think Armenians are extremely related to each other many think of you as an Iranian people not sure if this is true or false. ,KarabakhConflict,dfndhyv,1,t5_3dwnu
