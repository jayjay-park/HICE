I think there would be at least two factors ensuring the provision of services for children with special needs. On one hand you have parents with special needs kids creating demand for a school with specialized services. Why wouldnt businesses rise to meet this need? Its very possible that these schools would in fact cost more than other schools but thats an issue of relative pricing not whether or not the service would exist. Second in the case where parents could not afford to send their children to such a facility on their own I think its easy for us to ignore the role of charity. The fact is we care about people in our community. Before Government there were various forms of social organization to promote the common welfare of communities churches fraternal associations community groups traditional charities. In the absence of government I believe that the average person would give far more of their income as a percentage to causes such as this especially in their local community. One of the worst effects of government is that it encourages all of us to abdicate our collective responsibility because government is handling it.Those are just some thoughts of mine off the top of my head on this issue.edit Another way of looking at it is to look at services that ARENT provided by Government but could concievably be in some alternate universe. Imagine a country that had a Ministry of Language whos job it was to define words and create laws to ensure that everyone spoke and wrote according to the official rules that they endorsed. In such a world you can see how people who were accustomed to such policies might think that such an agency was necessary. After all no one could ever communicate if we didnt have an authority settling which words meant what and in what order to use them. ,ThoughtfulLibertarian,d1ynfo6,1,t5_2w9cp
