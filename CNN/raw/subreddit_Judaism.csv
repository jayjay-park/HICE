If you know of one please feel free to link to it.  My understanding is that they do not feel that the obligation to adhere to previously codified law is binding.  To me this is no different from reforms wholescale abrogation of Halacha except in that it is on a smaller scale.tldr can you explain why conservative does not feel it necessary to adhere to the aspect of Halacha that prohibits overturning established opinions?,Judaism,cejbj5m,1,t5_2qi67

62191,0,t1_celi5v6,I would put recreational marijuana in the same group with recreational alcohol in that its understandable and even expected for the average person to use it on occasion and the occasional person will use it regularly but with a keen eye to dissuasion of abuse. There are other substances that are much... Iffier in my opinion. LSD mushrooms etc. Even tobacco isnt quite as straightforward to classify as marijuana to me. Tobacco seems to cause cancer in much greater incidence although extracts of both plants are significantly healthier and are usually more highly controlled. The unfortunate part is that much of our system and even opinions for the classification of drugs comes from secular law and secular law was assembled ad hoc in response to whatever strange societal pressure was going on at the time. For LSD it was counterculture for marijuana it was reefer madness for alcohol it was religious piety then combatting crime etc. ,Judaism,celidt4,1,t5_2qi67

63036,0,t1_celjox3,My point which you seem to be missing is that selfinterest by itself provides no objective basis whatsoever for any kind of moral standard. On the contrary it makes morality into nothing more than a personal preference.Religion by its very nature and this is true even if the religion is entirely false posits the existence of an objective moral code that exists independently of human opinion. Once that is established the debate and there is a great deal of debate is over the content of that moral code. Did God reveal it? Do we have to figure it out for ourselves? How would we do so? Etc.The relevance of the dictators is to illustrate the difference between these approaches. If the entire basis of morality is simply selfinterest then what response can you make to a genocidal dictator who argues that his actions are in the best interests of himself and the people that he cares about. Of course you can argue that isnt true but strictly speaking he may be right. Maybe he and his friends really are better off with those people dead?In the end even if you successfully manage to convince the dictator that he will actually be better off if he doesnt commit genocide you are still left with the fact that in principle you acknowledge that if that were not true there would be no moral problem with what he wanted to do! In other words there is nothing inherently wrong with genocide or any other action. The only question is pragmatic do you or dont you benefit from the given action.However if we assume that morality exists independently of our personal opinions and preferences then the entire debate changes. We are no longer arguing about whether or not he will benefit from genocide but whether or not genocide is inherently a bad thing.Now of course the mere fact that you can make that claim doesnt guarantee that the dictator will listen to you. But at least you can justifiably claim that what he did was evil! From a purely secular perspective such a statement can never be made ever. The most that you can say is that what the person did was foolish and stupid as it didnt serve his best interests. And even that case can often be very difficult to make.,Judaism,cellu86,1,t5_2qi67

86952,0,t1_ceobmyd,gt Very briefly Judaism bases itself on the national historic experiences of the Jewish people. The most critical of those experiences was the mass revelation at Sinai at which God revealed Himself to the entire nation and in their presence appointed Moses as His prophet. Through Moses God gave the the Jewish people His Torah which includes the Five Books.of Moses together with an extensive interpretive tradition.This is an extremely controversial and logically inconsistent statement. I was certainly not taught this through my years of both Jewish day school and summer camps  in fact I had never even heard of such a claim until reading this forum. To call it historical and the basis for Judaism I would say at the very least is misleading.The real issue with citing this in your response to the OP though is that it provides no better basis for disbelief in Jesus based on rational historicity. Consider the Torah contains the narrative of Moshes death including events following it in the rd person. This means when he delivered the Torah to the Jewish people it was not only a narrative of the past as we consider it today  but an actual fortunetelling predictor of future events. There is no historical evidence and no hermeneutic tradition or any thing at all that Im aware of supporting the conjecture that the Torah ever predicted such a fine grained account of future events.,Judaism,ceobu4v,0,t5_2qi67

112455,0,t1_cer25pi,This is a common claim but it doesnt really match up with the facts. Obviously the rise of the nonOrthodox movements had a major impact on Orthodoxtraditional Jewish life in many ways and there are certainly some aspects of modern Orthodoxy that would be somewhat different if the nonOrthodox movements had never come into existence however that is a far cry from saying that Orthodox Judaism is somehow fundamentally different from the traditional Judaism of three or four hundred years ago.Imagine an alternate timeline in which none of the nonOrthodox movements e.g. Reform haskala secular Zionism etc. ever developed.

172031,0,t1_cexzb0o,Ive already addressed that in several previous comments. There are two significant concerns discussed by the poskim. There are number of significant demands that are required from a person wearing tefillin and failure to maintain this standard is itself a sin. For this reason the poskim discourage wearing tefillin beyond the basic minimum requirement of wearing them during morning prayers. For women who are not required to wear tefillin in the first place it is better that they not do so at all.. A number of authorities prohibit women from wearing tefillin because the desire to do so is often rooted in a rejection of the rabbinic tradition that they are not required. Any change to traditional practice that is rooted in a desire to fix Judaism is at best deeply suspect. This is especially true when the change is part of a general ideological movement that is foreign to Judaism such as feminism.,Judaism,cey0z8y,2,t5_2qi67

Its not to wear the tallit katan its to apply tzitzit when appropriate for a specific reason.The tallit katan is IMO a contrived garment. Humans used to wear garments that had four corners. We mostly dont have fourcornered garments today. So... we make up a garment that allows us to fulfill the mitzvah all the time... which hey fine go right ahead especially considering the purpose of this mitzvah. But observant Conservatives go to daily minyan andor say the morning prayers wearing their tallit gadol to fulfill the mitzvah of tzitzit. Some few wear them throughout the day.

So while you can say what you wish it really just sounds like a high school student talking about how he doesnt see whats so great about Shakespeare. And even if I also dont really understand whats so great about Shakespeare I am going to be more than a little hesitant to just write off his reputation as some kind of gadolatry or whatever the equivalent would be for English playwrights.gtBut to say he is fundamental or the most important is almost gadolatry and dismissive of the many other great rishonim of his time.Honestly I dont even know what gadolatry is nor why it whatever it is might be a bad thing. I assume that the word is somehow associated with idolatry but we are obviously not dealing here with a question of idol worship so obviously it means something else.I also dont see how it could be called dismissive of the other rishonim many of whom clearly agreed with this basic assessment.

345233,0,t1_cfgbneb,Really? Ive never had anyone comment on the convertiness of my Hebrew name. If anything I tend to get compliments on it. People definitely do name their kids Bruriah although I think that happens more often in Orthodox circles than Conservative or Reform. Shame really because Bruriah was a pistol and its too bad more people arent familiar with her.And I actually meant to clarify what I meant by social in my previous post but totally didnt. My experiences with Hillel were that most people were there primarily as a social endeavor as opposed to being there because they had some deep burning fervor to rediscover religion. Chabad was plenty social as well I definitely spent a lot of late Friday nights there just hanging out and talking but the tenor was different and Chabad had a rabbi which our Hillel did not. While there were certainly areas where I didnt specifically agree with said rabbi having one available of any denomination was worthwhile and important I think.I agree that everyone who has access to both should at least try both Hillel and Chabad. It can provide a pretty wellrounded Jewish experience without necessitating that someone go off campus. Im not super rahrah Chabad as an organization for a few different reasons but they do know how to meet people where they are and are very good at starting from ground zero if someone has no Jewish education and doesnt really know where to start.,Judaism,cfgjwd1,2,t5_2qi67

I think my husband gets different things from religion than I do and that can cause to move at different paces. There seems to also be misunderstanding about how serious the other person is about certain mitzvos. For example he is really serious about making minyan davening and learning formally. Those arent mitzvos we can do together so it can be confusing. Its also confusing for our friends whether they be secular or Jewish. Questions like so you wear skirts but he doesnt wear a kippah? can be funny since when youre married people treat you like one unit and assume you have the same amount of enthusiasm for all the same mitzvos.

This is halakha but the punishment isnt death andor kares and all punishments in the noahide law are death and kares. Also for this passage to work there needs to be a noahide court under jurisdiction of a sanhedrin and we do not accept these when the jubilee isnt observed. So theres that in favor of considering them Noahides. On the other hand to be a noahide you must observe the law because you believe it commanded not simply because reason confirms it to be true. You cant believe Judaism to be true and Islam to be true so yes you cant be a noahide and be a Muslim. It appears to me that the orthodox who believe Muslims to be noahide are mistaken in the rambams ruling.

However many Zionists like the entire Daati LeUmi movement do so out of a religious sense of Kedushas HaAretz. The Grizs objections had nothing to do with Shalosh Shvuos or tyranny. They had to do with a secular group of people trying to establishing a Halakhaless nation.And the Igros Moshe I was referring to is where R Moshe says making Aliyah is a Reshus and a Mitzvah Kayemes but not a Chiyuv. I dont have the Sfarim on me at the moment but Ill find the source later.No amount of revisionism can deny that numerous Gedolei Torah have made Aliyah and lived in Eretz Yisrael.

So you say that people shouldnt leave the world if they arent literally dying which is a surprising position to be sure and not one I agree with and suggest that there should be Rabbis equipped to deal with those who have already left I think. Or maybe those questioning whether they should leave?But for those who do find they have to leave apparently their only options are secularism or Islam or Christianity or being gay.What about teaching people that there are ways to be frum even within the so called ultraOrthodox world without having to conform entirely? Rabbi Finks recently posted article is relevant here and there are ways to maintain traditional Judaism without being ultraOrthodox and there are ways to maintain some of traditional Judaism or to still be religiously Jewish without being Orthodox at all.Hes from Israel so perhaps being secular includes being traditional but Israelis know that there are Datiim who are not Ultra. And I think Israelis know as well that there are many communities where you will still be considered close to the community without conforming to every law and custom of the community and not everything is even covered by laws and customs.tldr he makes some good points but its hard to see it as much of a discussion with so much left out in the middle,Judaism,cfzxpnm,4,t5_2qi67

551303,0,t3_20emni,I dont entirely agree.  I mean yes Halloween is more than just Commercial Purim  its rooted on Christian stories and celebrations and in Mexico it even connects with the synchretistic Dia de los Muertos.  But as far as the basic points of celebration go yeah Purim and Halloween are quite similar.  Both have observances involving costumes.  And of course Purim also has some of the carnaval in it with the fast preceding the feast rather than the other way around though for some reason theres less nudity at shul on Purim than in the Rio parade on carnaval...  Lets summarize a bit.  In Purim weEat cookies meant to represent the ears of the bad guy yeah not the hat Yiddish speakers!  I only eat the earsDress up in costumeSend meals and gifts to each other and to the poorGet really really drunkPlay with noisemakers and generally partyOK so we also read the Megillah well hopefully someone is still sober enough to do so but the other stuff is what really makes it a holiday.  It doesnt correspond to Halloween other than the costumes but the fact is that its a day where people dress up and get drunk.  Maybe the reason is different but its pretty close to what people do on Halloween and St. Patricks Day and Christmas and the other commercial Christian holidays.There was a time when John McCain was in Iraq I think with his Democratic pal Joe Lieberman and he mentioned something about Purim being like a Jewish Halloween.  He had to issue an apology which I thought was ridiculous because Purim is a Jewish Halloween.

905805,0,t3_24gap8,Can you suggest an alternative approach to be followed which is first and foremost true to Halacha but also not hurtful? Im sure if you had a really good answer then Orthodox Rabbis would love to start using it.I dont think anyone is trying to be hurtful but the reality is that it is a very unfortunate and difficult situation obviously for the person raised being told they are Jewish but also for the Rabbi who doesnt want to be rude and wants to be inclusive but feels obligated to say the halachic truth.I see this as similar if a couple comes to a Rabbi to get married and then it is found out they were adopted and really they are siblings. What is the nice way to tell them that it makes no difference what they feel in their heart it makes no difference about love they can never be married or their marriage accepted by Halacha?Similar to a Kohen marrying a divorcee or a Mamzer being born. There are unfortunate consequences of actions yes even our parents actions before we are born. If a person is born a Mamzer due to no fault of his own that is an irreversible status.

Even Christians who are forgiven of their sins must still atone for them. This is what penance is and it can be done on Earth or in Purgatory. This is necessary to maintain the justice of creation.

I picked my username because I like to sit in learn which is not synonomous with chareidi.  More strict does not mean more god fearing or more knowledgable or more inclined to learn.  gtBut you are not permitted to do it like this. Generalized statements like this one are highly offensive and very much violate the very laws that this thread is discussing.maybe I am a little sarcastic but characterizing chofetz chaim as over the top or more relevant to subgroups of judaism and even orthodoxy and not universal I dont think you can say is forbidden.  Especially in a forum which comprises all streams of judaism this is a relatable assessment and is not presented overly disparingly.  There are many rabbis which I or others revere whose rulings are called too lenient or not in accordance with torah for various reasons.  Or it is questioned if certain people can even be rabbis...  I think it is your personal reverance for chofetz chaim which prompts you to selectively defend him in this fashion but you must realize that it is not incumbant upon me to revere him in this fashion.And is it not a halakah that when coming to a new place one must adopt the minhaggim of that place?  The minhaggim of chareidim and chofetz chaim are based on life in eastern europe.  This style was non existent in america pre ww and is increasingly impractical as many of the old ashkenaz minhaggim are the result of insulation from a hostile surrounding culture and secular ideas seen as  a threat to torah observance.  In america we now accept many premises of secular thought and do not need to fear the gentiles.  I hope you realize I am not completely serious and am not trying to forbid people from following a certain path but it is not ideal IMO and when you imply that I must revere chofetz chaim you should contemplate that perhaps you must abandon these foreign minhaggim in america!,Judaism,ci87ge0,-2,t5_2qi67

1365898,0,t1_cin7grn,gt I did not find his alternatives reasonable at all. I found them extremely farfetched. Far more troublesome than the assumptions of DH which do have their own problems. Whybray was a far better critique of DH than Cassuto.Youre not supposed to be convinced. Again thats the whole point. Like I said the name of the book is Documentary Hypothesis not Mosaic Authorship. The alternatives provided are not supposed to be convincing they are supposed to be reasonable. Youre supposed to say yes thats technically a possibility. Youre going yeah but I have no reason to believe thats the case. Which is fine but youre not turning that same critique back on DH which is the next logical step. The entire point of the book is to provide an equally unbacked alternative reading that does not necessitate DH to show the DH is unsupported and circular which it absolutely is. Your next paragraph goes on to make the same error again and youre even more explicit about it. Among these easily rejectable theories is that the bible was written in its entirety before  BCE. There is enough evidence to reject an early author. Cassuto doesnt touch this point... This is wrong headed and if youre thinking these thoughts you didnt read the book right for all the reasons I just mentioned.gt Read the paragraph I wrote about why it chooses one name versus the other and then guess what name should appear in the Tower of Babel story. You would guess Elohim based on Cassutos theory and he admits that.....I dunno. I read the story and I see the tetragrammaton which means Im expecting a directly meddling deity. Which is exactly what I see. Like I said I dont have the book in front of me. If you want to debate this point I need the arguments on both sides as presented in the book. The same goes for this Cain birth was joyous and deep connection with god so use YHWH Seths birth was sad because Abel died so use Elohim. I think joyous vs sad is the wrong way to go about differentiating the names of Gd. Its more like naturalistic vs personal but youre missing the point. The point is that the words have different meanings at least the idea that they have different meanings as at least as reasonable as the idea that theyre actually different deities. Yet again youre reading this as an alternative to DH instead of a critique of DH which is just wrong.gt Do you agree with Cassuto that the Torah contains contradictions in fact? This is the crux. How you resolve that is the next step.It doesnt matter. Its not the topic and your entire comment is stuck on this aside. if youre not talking about the support of DH that comes from outside the assumptions of DH youre autowrong for not staying on point. Yet again if youre arguing this point you didnt understand the point of the book and I strongly believe you need to reread it with the correct mindset. Im not saying Cassuto is  right about everything he said but you are  off topic and fundamentally arguing past the book in a way that demonstrates simply not understanding the purpose of the text. Which is even more demonstrated in your last two paragraphs.gt The problem is that there are multiple ideas of what DH is. My idea of DH is very different than the one Cassuto argues against. So its not surprising that his arguments felt hollow to me.Because this is wrong. The details are different but the pillars are absolutely necessary and each one is individually necessary to all formulations of DH and refuting one of them topples the whole thing which is whygt He also completely mangles the ending....is ironic because its actually you mangling the ending. Horribly so because you not only dont understand Cassutos point has ive now demonstrated ad nauseum but you also dont understand DH. This whole paragraph is just factually incorrect. By your math theres actually  chance DH is incorrect. If you topple one premise they all fail. You say it doesnt work like that but it does. You can show me an elaborate geometric proof but if its based on the principle that the internal angles of a triangle total  proving that one fact wrong does topple the whole proof.I dont have the book in front of me so I cant debate the specifics and its clear that your points against the book are based on a fundamentally faulty reading of both DH and the purposes of the book. You obviously read the book with the idea that he was creating a cogent alternative to DH which means you missed the purpose of the book. This is probably because you read the book with the idea of refuting it instead of seeing what it actually had to say. Im not saying thats true but Ive read books the same way and this is what happens when you do that. For example I find myself doing this with Gerald Schroeder all the time especially his biology. But he actually did change my opinion on the teleology of the different phyla and I found it enhancing my understanding of Aristotle in a way I dont think Schroeder intended. I was stuck on the fact that I thought he intended a physical tampering with evolution but reconsideration showed it was a teleological argument. Reread the book or at least a few sections with this in mind.

1645760,0,t1_cjmlo51,Hmm I thought you said Lamarckism and Lyskenkoism seemed to be a political structure that used it as a basis. So to be clear Im talking about the heritability of acquired characteristics.Im also a layman so I cant say very much Ill explain it simply with more technical words in parenthesis since I dont know your knowledge level. The basics of it that I know is that experiences stimuli over the course of an organisms life can change whether genes are turned on or off expressed. Since genes are usually just codes for a cell to make proteins expression simply means whether or not the specific proteins are made.  This is mostly caused by the way the genome is foldedheld together. For example and this might be relevant for people here the gene for lactose tolerance in adults can frequently stop being expressed i.e. the protein it codes for stops being make if you stop drinking milk. So an adult with lactose tolerance who does not drink milk for a few months would find it difficult to start again because there are no more proteins to break it down.The theory is that the expression of genes in addition to the genes themselves can also be passed down by parents. How exactly it works Im not clear about. Its not Lamarckism in its original and expansive form but it does share similarities.,Judaism,cjmm17n,1,t5_2qi67

But I do believe strict observance of ancient laws can easily become an obstacle to spiritual growth as demonstrated by sexist and homophobic attitudes that are codified in sacred texts but completely incompatible with ethical values.Again poor choices of words aside I was explaining how liberal religion can be at least as authentic and in some cases more authentic depending on what you consider to be the foundation of the religion.,Judaism,ckcwbap,-5,t5_2qi67

If they are more religious then the holiday isnt considered a New Year celebration but rather as the day all your deeds are judged and your fate for the upcoming year is decreed.

1882511,0,t3_2g3xao,Guys single for a reason. Him looking for tznius is exactly like a secular guy looking for a doubleD  focusing on the physical appearance of the girls he comes across.Its sad that a yeshivish education leads bochurim to these idiotic values. Yes a bochur should look for someone who is tznius since that is a Torah value. But that doesnt mean tznius in dress that means tznius in heart. A girl who is makpid on stockings and necklines so that her tznius can be admired by bochurim is not tznius at all.This bochur needs to start looking not at hemlines and stockings but at the girls heart and learn to get over his jealousy over how other men look at his future wife. An unattractive wife will be unattractive to her husband too  what a man really looks for is not unattractiveness but loyalty.And his understanding of secular culture is completely screwed up. Strong longterm secular relationships are not about selfishness. Plenty of secular people do get married for life. Thinking that your marriage is about fulfilling what God wants and not what your wife wants is a surefire path to divorce.Its good that this letter is anonymous as that bochur would never get another shidduch date again after being vetoed by every girls mother out there and her aunt.,Judaism,ckg19xk,1,t5_2qi67

2155831,0,t1_cldswvx,gt The rabbinic ordinance is lest people get mixed up.Thats very faulty logic though.  Were comparing chicken and beefgoatlamb.  People getting mixed up would be eating beef with sheeps milk because its easy to get that confused.  Chicken is not easily confused with mammals meat not by a long shot.  This ordinance is squarely in the making stuff up category.  A similar restriction would be to forbid lighting a candle on all days of the week lest people get mixed up on Shabbat and think that its Wednesday.  A reasonable restriction would be to forbid eating any combination of foods if there is a reasonable chance that the person has gotten confused and might be boiling a calfkid in its mothers milk.  When youre eating chicken especially in modern times you are quite aware that it has not been boiled in its nonmammal mothers milk.  People do not get mixed up over this.  This restriction has the force of halacha only because nobody has had the authority to call out this total invention of Torah for what it is.Again if you respect halacha regardless of its origins then thats fine.

2297261,0,t3_2ljmks,after reading other comments i thought id go at this anthropologically.    archaeology confirms that some form of Judaism dates back  years.    back then the few who could read or write were of the ruling or priest class.  so religion revolved around supporting and participating in priestshaman rituals.    judaism was innovative not just as monotheism trying to ween people off idols    it also attempted to make each new member feel like a roving priest intern  or ambassador of the religion and like any job this requires some training.    this empowerment was needed to replace the personal idols people carried.  this approach may help explain why judaim didnt spread yet was resilient  enough to survive mostly intact for  millennium.  i dont think jews were    chosen by god any more than christians or moslems rather that jews  are choosy about who they include in their religion thus the tribulation   applied to weed applicants out who may not be totally committed to it.  ,Judaism,clvnnvd,1,t5_2qi67

2361738,0,t1_cm3lv27,can I assume your family is not strictly religious like you drive places on shabbat dont only eat food under hashgacha etc...and that you are more observant than your family...Im not saying you have to be happy but I wouldnt make a big fuss.  Because you cannot control other people and it seems that to your sister judaism is not super important.  And I do not think there is anything unethical about this as it doesnt seem like she or your family in general believes that you have these obligations from god but rather its your familys tradition.  and while I see that as important it is unethical to tell someone how to live so that they fit in better with your lifestyle they have a right to live how they want...the same way you are becoming more observant and if you continue on this path you will find many things that will separate you from your family because of orthodoxy and its likely that because of this your family will urge you to not get involved in this but you have a right to choose how you want to live.and I would insist that if you find yourself taking on customs which say make it impossible to eat by your parents that you examine closely what youre doing because the orthodox community will accept you so long as you follow the rules but if you dont they will not.  whereas your family will most likely accept you whether you are orthodox athiest etc... but that is for another thread.I understand that it probably feels like a big seperation from your sister which bothers you but I dont think you can fault her morally for this and I think you need to be tolerant of what your family does so even if it bothers you a lot I would not antagonize the situation.  Because she is going to do what she is going to do and she is family the situation is not yours to control and you dont want to make this one day into a thing with long term animosity.my  cents.,Judaism,cm3mdm3,5,t5_2qi67

Your name is Matthew not matisyahu.  Your family is your parents not the rebbe.  Youre interested in Torah great!  Show him how to learn and let him integrate this into his life instead of extending his years of teen angst into a lifelong process.  Yeah he was able to leave when the mood passed but hes a millionaire rock star with a huge social network.  Most people to whom this happens are stuck.  I love Chabad but sometimes and I think this is the bts more than the ffbs they try and coerce people to adopt a set of minhaghim not because its the best thing for them but because they are validated when a new recruit grows a beard wears a yarmulke changes his name...  And this is of course not only Chabad. If he had spent his s learning Torah and integrating it with who he was instead of following his childish tendencies to run off and join a band perhaps he would have found a spouse not destined for divorce and his sense of Judaism would be strong enough for him to maintain it when he gets involved with a new social circle,Judaism,cmkg2ce,-1,t5_2qi67

2567206,0,t1_cmtmm6z,Two more things one I believe only the Sanhedrin rather than local religious courts can mete out death penalties in Jewish law.  And theres no Sanhedrin today.  All attempts to revive it have failed though the last was in .  Two even when there was a Sanhedrin the Talmud insists they were death penalties were rarely given out.  You can see the way that evidentiary law is structured its basically impossible to.  There are actually a lot of other requirements not mentioned in ubegeges comment like the witnesses cant be related to each other the warning must come within seconds of performing the sin in the time it took to say Peace unto you my Rabbi and my Master etc..  There are other weird conditions that are required too like if all judges agree on the death penalty then the person is let go the theory being that if no one can make a good argument that the person is innocent then there must be something wrong with the trial procedure.  The Talmud says famouslygtA Sanhedrin that puts a man to death once in seven years is called destructive. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah says even once in seventy years. Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Tarfon say had we been in the Sanhedrin none would ever have been put to death. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says they would have multiplied shedders of blood in Israel.One important thing to know about the word translated destructive here is also translated as bloody elsewhere ovlanit the term ovel generally implying a type of injury in which there is blood.Later authorities are similarly disinclined towards the death penalty the RaMBaM Maimonides probably the most important single Jewish authority since the Talmud writes It is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent one to death.So while Jewish law is in theory fine with the death penalty in practice it is so skeptical of its actual implementation that its hard to make an argument for anything more than the hypothetical threat of the death penalty from the Talmud.,Judaism,cmto7cr,13,t5_2qi67

Theyre meant for nailing the bottom plates of walls down onto concrete slabs or into concrete walls imo and are likely to break a brick.  Tapcons are coated steel screws for use in masonry which you predrill with a masonry bit preferably with a hammer drill  Unless you have some kind of industrial mezuzah I think the big blue tapcon heads would look strange sticking out of your mezuzah.   How about this  attach a nice piece of wood to the brick using a hiddenfastener technique then nail your mezuzah to the wood with the standard little brad nails?  I recommend using   or  tapcons to secure the wood to the brick.  Countersink the hole in the wood to the right size to receive a wooden plug you can buy and then glue in.  The first technique in this video is the one to use to cover up the countersunk tapcon hole.In short youre screwed and its hard and you sort of need a minor carpenter to do it.  You need  tapcons masonry bit masonry drill wood regular drill the correct wood drill bit and premade wooden plugs.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings here this is way more epic of a feat than I suspect you wanted to get into just to hang a mezuzah.  Has anyone actually really used tape in this situation?

2765855,0,t3_2rqwds,gtThe term was coined by Wilhelm Marr  to define Jew hatredFactually incorrect. He used it early in  but the term existed before then.gtThere are no words for any other hatred of a people...There ARE words we just dont really use them. Antisemitism itself is a compound word meaning that a person is against semites which in its cultural context generally meant Jew as Jews were the only significant Semitic peoples living amongst the nonsemitic Europeans of the th century. The term Semite originates with the biblical name Shem the antecedent of the Semitic peoples which includes Arabs Jews and so on. To that degree I could construct antihamite to describe being against African peoples and it would be technically valid.gtIf youre anti black youre a racist. If youre anti Italian youre a racist if you dont like Asians as a whole youre not anti Asian youre defined as a racist. Racist simply describes that the person has a hatred of other races. If you want to be specific you would have to say AntiItalian which is linguistically equivalent to saying AntiJew or AntiSemite.gtthey love using the term Antisemitism to describe hatred for themselves and the state of Israel...Because historically despite the secular Jew otherwise fitting well into society they continued to be isolated and discriminated against based on their race. In many ways this continues to exist in many forms where people continue to find reason to hate otherwise completely assimilated members of their society based on their racial background.The damage of AntiZionism is that it has given a nonracial hatred that just so happens to be focused on one racial group and their homeland legitimizing it in the modern worldview and a modern incarnation of the traditional antisemitism.Note simply that I dont mean being critical about Israel but true antizionism which continually manifests itself in violence against Jews and a denial of their natural rights under the guise of being solely antiZionist.gtthey are simply bridging theie connection to Judaism and admitting the fundamental differences they have as Jews from the other nations.For the secular Jew they see it as their continued oppression for simply being a part of an ethnic group which makes it an appropriate word. From a religious perspective we can say that Jews ARE in fact different from the other nations simply that it is not a regular secular hatred but an imbued experience due to being a part of a nation that has a unique connection with Gd.,Judaism,cnigtoe,3,t5_2qi67

As long as sexual exclusivity is perceived to be an essential part of marriage fewer married couples will have sex outside the partnership and there will be less disease. If sexual activity is seen as an optional low priority aspect of marriage which is the direction its moving as samesex couples are entering the institution there will be more disease among gay AND straight people involved in it.Youre simply not right that laws require business owners to serve gay and straight couples alike. Yes they do in Boston. But there are still many places in Texas etc. where a business owner can absolutely say we provide wedding cakes to marriages we consider marriages only and two men cannot get married in our eyes. If gay marriage comes to their city state or nation they will no longer be able to do that  which is a great reason for them to oppose gay marriage because gay marriage literally restricts their freedom.In places with neither gay marriage nor nondiscrimination laws my example above applies.As for your constant references to the quality of my argumentation theyre becoming tiresome.

3233842,0,t1_cox5vj1,gtIf god is a discrete entity and is causal why should god have special dispensation to not also be uncaused? You said physical object but for the purposes of interacting with the world god would act in a metaphysical way perhaps but otherwise have some sort of existance that would need to be caused to begin. Gd is not physical and does not have parts. The causal chain must terminate somewhere and only gd can meet the requirements for not requiring a cause. It can be demonstrated that physical objects require causes. Physical objects have parts and they require an explanation for how they came to be. Even imagine there be two gods they would have to be different in some way. They would each be the cause of the difference in the other and that difference would itself be a third thing that causes the difference in the others. No matter what type of multiple part system you posit it will imply a chain of causation that terminates at a principle which itself does not demand a cause.gtAs far as things being arbitrary just to pull out a random one how about the various actions of the kohenim during the services of the high priest? He must shake the blood once upward and seven times downward and so on and so forth. If you check my post history Im mobile now so I cant link it search for sacrifice in the last day or so. Its a conversation with carbonious where I discuss this exact question. Let me know if you cant find it or have any questions.gtNow if the answer is because thats just how rituals are then fine I was in a fraternity and know that traditional rituals can be weird and just symbolic....however this is somewhat different in that the assertion is that god himself has required that this specific actions take place. Its not a human ritual designed to be symbolic of something for the purposes of teaching its mean to be some kind of pleasing ceremony to a divine being. What is pleasing to Gd is that it instill good character traits in us and brings us to learn important lessons. And it being pleasing to Gd is metaphorical. Gd doesnt change. If we acted and this affected a change in gd then we would be a cause of gd and gd does not change. Rather it is his will that we submit to his Torah and we say we are pleased when our will is satisfied so we by analogy say that our service is pleasing to Gd.gtAnother example would be prohibitions against mixing such as different fabrics. Different crops could be explained by agricultural efficiency and not boiling a calf in its mothers milk is in my mind a prohibition against weird animal cruelty that was taken way off course by mortal leaders later. But not wearing shatnetz clothing has no good reasoning. The purpose of these is to distance oneself from idolatry. Shatnez was worn by pagans as part of their rituals and boiling a calf in milk was a fertility ritual. Many of the commandments concern every day mundane aspects and every time we eat or put on clothing we symbolically distance ourselves from idolatry. Different crops as well as yolking different animals together and even shatanez has two lessons. One is fairness. When you mix different crops the value of the mixture when harvested is the value of the lesser. When two different animals push the weaker is pushed too hard and the stronger ends up doing all the productive work. And linen is expensive and cool and wool is cheap and hot. Wool was used as a cheap filler and cheapens the linen again analogous to the mixed crops. These verses were used in support of the practice of grouping students by ability instead of age as you see in the west. The second lesson from this is economical it maximizes each items individual value. By separating the items each ones value is allowed to shine and its detrimental properties contained to itself. Conversely in the temple we offer cakes mixed with oil. This teaches us to process items and mix them when their value is greatly increased. Raw grain and olives gain value when milled and pressed mixed and baked. They compliment each other in a way forbidden mixtures do not.,Judaism,cox6zcy,1,t5_2qi67

Im using the assumption that the Torah purports to be an educational piece of literature intended to be believed and believable.Are you sure youre not projecting modern knowledge to ancient people who were considerably less knowledgable about certain details.  Its not clear to me that a st millennium BCE Israelite would be able to tell you that something like a volcanic eruption a comet or a solar eclipse were possible albeit rare while something like a wall of water or the sun moving backwards in the sky was impossible.  We today know that the sun moves across the sky because the world is turning.  But that wasnt known until long after the time that the Torah was written.  To an ancient author and audience I have a hard time buying that they would disbelieve the sun moving backwards in the sky on the basis of it being scientifically impossible.  They had no way of knowing that.Even with something like a talking donkey there are lots of people even today who think that it literally happened.  Not everyone is a skeptic.Similarly I find this a bit confusinggt its irrational to assume something supernatural when something natural does the jobYes this is true for actual events.  But I dont search out natural explanations for something like the story of Perseus and Medusa.  I guess this relates to the differences in assumptions about what the Torah is.  So if you dont mind can you outline what you think the differences are between the book of Genesis and the Epic of Gilgamesh?  I choose those two because they seem very similar in genre to me.gtProphetic vision. The mechanism for a hallucination is not the same mechanism for a prophetic vision. A hallucination has its origin and expression in the imaginative faculty. A hallucination has its origin in the intellective faculty and its expression in the imaginative faculty.You will have to elaborate on this because Im not sure I understand the distinction.  I think I would still call your prophetic vision a hallucination but that may just be a matter of semantics so its irrelevant.  Can you give an example of a prophetic vision?  Is it possible to describe it neurologically compared to other hallucinations that we have some characteristics of?  Would any of these be considered a prophetic vision dreaming hallucinations from schizophrenia hallucinations caused by meditation hallucinations caused by sensory deprivation chemical induced hallucinations LSD etc.?  Do you believe that prophetic visions ceased with Malachi or do they still exist today?  If we cannot determine differences neurologically how can we distinguish between a prophetic vision a hallucination or just a fictive creation?gtPillar of salt having similar sounding consonants to look for the king.Im not sure this is a useful explanation the chet and kaf would not be interchangeable sounds to an Israelite although they are to a modern day Ashkenazic Jew.  Personally I think the story is best explained etiologically but thats another topic.gtYes except Im not sure euphemism is the right word. The presence of angels is also indicative of a prophetic vision. Im not saying every single instance of a prophetic vision is indicated with such language or imagery but enough of them are that the torah is clearly indicating that prophecy can occur in a naturalistic fashion and opening eyes is about as explicit as it gets.I can agree with you that opening eyes could be interpreted in the way you say.  But I disagree that you can then apply it to every case.  There are many where it seems off.  For example using Balaam yet again.  When he saw the angel God opened his eyes Numb  it actually uses a slightly different word than open but thats fine.  This could be a prophetic vision by what I think is your definition sure.  However one would expect then if the speaking to the donkey was also a prophetic vision you would see something like And God opened Balaams ears.  But thats not what you get instead you get And God opened the donkeys mouth.  This is just one example.  I think the problem I have with your interpretation is that it just doesnt seem to be supported enough in the text itself.  I honestly think the other interpretation the author actually meant the donkey opened its mouth is more logical.  But as noted above this comes from the fact that I dont share your assumptions about what the Torah is.,Judaism,coxwnch,1,t5_2qi67

In fact one could say that electricity is permitted once the prohibited uses are excluded.Nor are the doraisa issues all necessarily obvious.The problem with your approach is that instead of actually clarifying the issue you are just muddying the waters further. Instead of explaining that the assumption of an intrinsic issue with electricity is incorrect and that each application has to be studied independently you accept that there is an issue with electricity in of itself pure electricity in your words but that the issue is only drabanan.

3410557,0,t3_2z8d6v,gt quoted from John  In the beginning the Word logos already existed the Word logos was with Gd theos and the Word logos was Gd theos.Quoting from John presupposes that John has authority equivalent to the prophets of Tanach and that those words are True and only correct interpretation is needed to extract truth from them.We do not suppose these things. It is very possible that John wrote those words with the intention of substantiating the claim that God is triune but that he had no basis for that claim.As it is there are only two objects of that statement GodTheos and The WordLogos so I dont understand where the third or Jesus comes from.I hesitate to ascribe any truth to the gospels but it seems to me that it could even be interpreted in consonance with Jewish Tradition  the WordWill of God ie the Torah in its most encompassing sense existed before Creation and is inseparable from God.The word elohim is used in a number of ways in scripture. Sometimes it means God sometimes it means false gods and sometimes it means angels or just powerful humans. We know which sense is being used by a combination of context and tradition.Its not completely absurd to read the Bible as suggesting that there are other gods but God is more powerful. Even today there are those who want to read it like that. As far as Jewish tradition is concerned its a nonstarter those are corrupted readings against the obvious intention of the Bible based in ignorance or deliberate misreading.

3638296,0,t3_320j22,One issue is that it is easier to identify Jews who were kicked out of Spain than Muslims. Separate Sephardi literally Spanish as Spain is Sefarad identity continues to the present day. Its relatively easy to identify these Spanish Jews from the general Jewish population. I know of no equivalent way to identify the descendents of Spanish Muslims. Second the cultural connection between Sephardi Jews and Spain has continued. In Turkey a lot of my Jewish friends less so this generation but in the older generations definitely speak fluent Ladino which is also known as JudeoSpanish. Sephardi food still shows a lot of influence from Spain even in the names of the dishes. These are the people probably most likely to move to Spain the ones who already have the language skills. There was an earlier round of giving Spanish passports to Turkish Jews I dont know if it applied to other Sephardi countries. I know several highly educated Ladinospeaking Jews who claimed them. On a practical level I dont think Spain expects many Sephardi Jews to actual move to Spain and if they do I think it expects high tech Israeli Jews who just want to work in Europe anyway. What the reality is of who will claim this citizenship I dont know but Im fairly confident thats what Spain predicts. Which means this wont actually cost them much money for the good publicity they hope and may inspire some entrepreneursskilled workers to move to Spain. If Spain could identify Spainish Muslims in North Africa they would anticipate them being of a different skill strata as others have pointed out. So I think youre right its not fair in a global sense but its i think understandable from a practical sense. It also fits into long standing Orientalist views of European countries which view Muslims as particularly other often more so than the Jews even which is impressive. For example the French gave Arab Christians and Jews from Algeria French citizenship in the th century but not French Jews not that we were de facto considered equal citizenssee for example the Dreyfus Affair which inspired Herzl to push for Zionism but at least generally considered as citizens in the postNapoleanic era up until ish after which as our numbers declined we became more or less de facto as well as de jure equal citizens of continental Europe except the Soviet Union which continued open discrimination against the Jews until the very end. ,Judaism,cq6zrex,8,t5_2qi67

The Government appears concerned about the emigration of Jewish citizens and permission generally is not granted for all members of a Jewish family to travel outside the country at the same time.Andgt In  the group Families of Iranian Jewish Prisoners FIJP published the names of  Jews who disappeared while attempting to escape oh? why would they do that from the country in the s. The families continued to report anecdotal evidence that some of the men were in prisons. The Government never has provided any information regarding their whereabouts and claims that it has not charged any of them with crimes. FIJP believes that the Government has dealt with these cases differently than it has with other similar cases because the persons involved are Jewish. The families of the missing individuals reported that government officials claimed they lacked the authority to discover whether the missing individuals were being detained. ,Judaism,cqmqf9f,8,t5_2qi67

Each position is a prayer to the god shiva see here  or to the god surya see  I think there are different sequences they have and different ones are prayers to different gods.The only question that could be is about modified yoga where they change the positions but the origin is still the real yoga.See here  where the Lubavitcher Rebbe says to take the medical ideas out of yoga and teach them but the yoga itself is idol worship.A possible question is if the person doing the positions doesnt know its idol worship but the answer is here It says that its forbidden to do it even unintentionally  i.e. without intent if that is the manner that that idol is worshiped.So basically if you want to do yoga you must invent new positions and do those but not any of the original ones.Also see ,Judaism,cqsalne,1,t5_2qi67

Justice Bader Ginsburg clarified Leviticus problem with homosexual unions  in a patriarchal society putting a male in the role of a woman was considered an act of abuse and debasement.

3994460,0,t3_366kp1,The basic idea of Reform Judaism since its inception has been that commandments are not binding and subject to choice.Here is the commentary from the  commentary on the principles of Reform JudaismMitzvot. The Hebrew root of this word is tzadeyvavhey usually translated command. Since its inception the Reform Movement has wrestled with the classic notion of God commanding us  it seems so frontal so authoritarian so hierarchical. But if God is in dialogue with us perhaps we hear Gods commands as though God were calling out to us in words that a beloved human being in our lives might use It is very important to me that you do this  awaiting our response. We may respond to many of these calls by taking on these sacred obligations building them into our lives to others we may respond We need to dialogue more. To others we may respond I cannot do this act  in terms of my present moral or communal understanding it seems meaningless or even wrong. And perhaps God responds as our beloved might Lets keep the conversation going.Additionally this is primarily how virtually all Reform Jews in practice engage their religion so both in ideology and practice Reform is largely about freedom of choice.I am not sure how or why some claim this is false or even controversial.

Critics of Israeli policy say that a system of control in the Israelioccupied West Bank including the ID system Israeli settlements separate roads for Israeli and Palestinian citizens around many of these settlements military checkpoints marriage law the West Bank barrier use of Palestinians as cheaper labour Palestinian West Bank exclaves inequities in infrastructure legal rights and access to land and resources between Palestinians and Israeli residents in the Israelioccupied territories resembles some aspects of the South African apartheid regime and that elements of Israels occupation constitute forms of colonialism and of apartheid contrary to international law. Some commentators extend the analogy to include treatment of Arab citizens of Israel describing their citizenship status as secondclass. gtA secondary part of that statement should be that Israel is the only Jewish government on the planet. Therefore when Israel does something it is viewed as the action of Jews everywhere and local Jews get the antisemitism fallout from it like the Gaza war caused many antisemitic attacks in Europe.True.

I just dont think of orthodoxy in the same way that I think you are.gtThis really doesnt provide justification for the Conservative and Reform movements though. Even if you think theres more room for change it still has to be done within the confines of halachaMy comment was not intended to justify the Conservative or Reform movements. It was purely for the purposes of pointing out a major flaw that many people that affiliate with Conservative or Reform groups see within orthodoxy.gtIf I understand what youre saying about your personal history you left Orthodoxy because you felt like people were overdoing their piousness because they werent folllwing the Torah and halacha for the right reasons. If thats the case why shift to reform or conservative? Im not talking about you specifically here but people in general that have these views. Because Orthodox overdoes the idea of keeping to halacha we should completely ignore halacha altogether? Why is it all or nothing?I dont think that most people see it as all or nothing. I think it is a comfort thing. I think once a person starts to notice this stuff like the Rambam says they may need to swing to another extreme before they can find a middle ground that works for them. For others the ConservativeReform movement is the middle ground. Having grown up the way that I did I never felt comfortable in a Conservative or Reform shul. It was just awkward to be there.gt Because Orthodox overdoes the idea of keeping to halacha we should completely ignore halacha altogether?

The gemarra leaves that with a teiku.

4732035,0,t1_ctqzdcl,What you doubt that TaySachs and Sickle Cell Anemia show up in higher concentrations among certain racialethnic populations?Or perhaps you doubt the idea that different selective pressures could cause different human populations with tendencies to breed within the group to develop different genetic trends which in turn contribute to in whole or in part demographic trends relating to these populations?Im not saying blacks are dumber than whites or Jews and Asians are smarter than whites.  I denounce those ideas unequivocally the evidence isnt there and besides that such an absolute statement is absurdly unlikely.  Im also certainly not saying that people should make judgements on those points blindly hiring a Caucasian over a person of African descent for instance any trends which may exist are not likely to be strong enough to justify such a policy and even if they were itd be terrible for society.  Im just putting forward the idea that different selective pressures on isolated or semiisolated populations may have lead to real genetic differences leading to certain genes which were selected for to a greater degree in one population than another being more prevalent in one population than another and therefore the traits which they affect being expressed in different ratios in those populations.  EDIT I dont even consider it certain or likely that the trends are particularly strong.  I just think that its plausible that the trends exist.It happens in every other species on Earth.  I dont see why we should disregard the idea as it applies to humans offhand simply because it is uncomfortable and inconvenient.  Better to face it head on and factor the possibility into our planning.EDIT Besides all that my core point is that its a grey area.

4794114,0,t3_3gha20,Hey there! So the Tanya is written in a way thats makes its deepest parts somewhat difficult for beginners to Jewish mysticism and its even harder if one is not already very familiar with Jewish nigleh or traditional learning.For example there are numerous places where the Baal HaTanya will reference a particularly esoteric concept and then just say and the wise will understand. or and this will suffice for the familiar.That said there is still a lot to be gleaned from it even at a basic level especially in its practical applications like its advice on how to strengthen certain feelings and traits like Ahavas Hashem or Ahavas Yisrael through thinking deeply on specific ideas or what to tell the Yetzer Hara. Or how one should feel about challenges and setbacks in ones spiritual work.Perhaps it would be best for you to examine why you want to learn Tanya? What do you hope to gain from it? What makes you think its valuable?As a side note generally Jewish classics are meant to be learned with a partner andor teacher. Its part of our tradition obsession .

Ive come to notice Hillel can be very traditional or very liberal depending on the campus. Chabad is more about connecting one with Judaism in the religious sense whereas Hillel caters more on having Jews socialize with one another.

5069297,0,t3_3kf5vj,I know Ive said things similar to this in the past. I never realized they might be hurtful but the reason I say them is due to history. Judaism has in the past not been just the nice things like candle lighting and challah baking. Its also been persecutions pogrums and worse. Although a person whos father isnt Jewish isnt halachically Jewish they would be considered racially Jewish by many outside the community. If God forbid gentiles ever got their pitchforks out against us again a person whos father is Jewish would be swept up with us. Therefore I dont consider it a big step for them to become more Jewish.    Contrast that with a convert. His or her connection to Judaism might be strong but the  years since the Holocaust have also been very good times historically speaking for us. You probably didnt read that Rabbi Akiva was tortured to death. Or think about who the people were who suffered through two thousand years of being killed for our religion. Or think about the people who were expelled from Muslim countries.     I was born into this faith. My fate is the fate of the Jewish people whether the times ahead are good or bad. A convert has a choice though. I dont want them to be lulled into believing this is how it has always been. A gentile can live a good and righteous life without being Jewish. If you choose to cast your lot with Judaism you have to know these things before hand and be sure you want to take the possible bad times if they come with the good.,Judaism,cux1ihb,21,t5_2qi67

5141421,0,t3_3ldult,Some people prefer to follow the Jewish calendar but just because they view it as objectively more correctconsonant with Jewish life not because those names are idolatrous in fact the month names we generally apply to the Jewish calendar are Babylonian and probably also have idolatrous connections.Many people are just more comfortable with the solar calendar and its conventional names and of course anyone dealing with nonJews have to use this as well. Personally I also think the solar calendar is more objectively correct as a measure of years though the lunar calendar is a better measure of months and perhaps everything else so I eg celebrate my Gregorian birthday more heartily than my Jewish calendar birthday.Main point Using those names isnt ascribing any power or existence to the things they are named after its just a useful convention though to be honest I do wish it were different  more descriptive perhaps  personally.Theres also a Jewish convention of naming the days of the week after the Sabbath eg The Holy Sabbath the first day after Sabbath ... the day before the Sabbath which I like. It infuses just a little reminder of spirituality into all your physicality related plans. If I could use that in general usage I would but even among Jews most people are more comfortable with Sunday Monday... Jews do tend to use Hebrew etc equivalents of the term Sabbath rather than Saturday.So I guess that kind of covers the private environment part of the question. We also tend to connect things to Jewish events biblical feasts on an ad hoc basis but it depends on context. So if something is happening towards the end of the year I might say around Hannukah time rather than NovemberDecemberish or if I mean at the beginning of the rainy season I might say Sukkottime. And things like that.gt how do I name the biblical deity without potentially offending anyone?God is fine.

I miswrote above.I think youre wrong about most Reform Jews caring about things but just disagreeing.  Given my background growing up most Reform Jews and Conservative and TBH Orthodox Jews too arent really tied to the philosophical underpinnings theyre just doing whatever their parents and community tell them is right.  There are many Reform Jews who are dedicated to the tenets of Reform Judaism but they are vastly outnumbered by the people who are Reform because thats what their parents were or that was a lowpressure way to be involved in Judaism.  This is also why Bronfman is scared because Lubavitch is also a lowpressure way to be involved in Judaism.  This is why they are so successful.By lowpressure I mean that they will not turn away anyone.  Obviously they can and do pressure people to do mitzvos.gtClearly Reform Jews want to engage with Israel in a way that antiZionist Orthodox Jews dont.I disagree.  NK has their philosophy and beliefs and are actively working to undermine an Israeli state.  Witness things like picketing parades going on news shows in Iran etc.  J Street has their own philosophy and is decidedly nonmainstream themselves  for example they werent allowed to join the Council of Presidents.  Heres a quotegtReacting after the vote the same member said that there had been a serious and appropriate debate at yesterdays meeting and that it wasnt a rightwing vote.  It was the center that rejected J Street the source explained adding that things change and they could try again. This was really done on their merit.

If a candidate sucks and they are as close to your view as it gets youre basically SOL.Like...Obama sucks hard. But Im not going to invest my confidence in someone who equally sucks hard or potentially sucks harder.  Id rather not vote than be part of the supporting count for the evil I know.A few weeks back when I filled in as a body for this speed dating event my friends wife organized one of the girls  ratio.... was someone involved in politics.  She made a very good point about looking at voting record and I realized that for Israel it makes sense to go on this.  Her whole case was in favor of Yisrael Beiteinu.  I nearly fell out of my chair that a supposedly dati MO American girl would ever vote in favor of the guy.  She made a pretty good case though.  According to her own research they did the most for olim in terms of rights and benefits and help integrating.  Their voting record stood solid as she understood it. They were Rightwing and helped her immediate needs i.e. stuff for olim.  It doesnt matter that theyre mostly secular Russians or that Lieberman sounds like a clown when he rants in his public speeches.I could respect that. She did her research knew what she wanted to focus on and put her vote there.  She wasnt voting Labor because muh progressiveness and she wasnt voting Bayit Yehudi because Bennett wont apologize.  She wasnt voting Likud because Bibi. She votes like how I think we all should vote.,Judaism,cx1xw4t,3,t5_2qi67

Personally I think you should be able to choose!With that said personally I would probably do what they ask until Im on my own. When you were born into a Jewish family they didnt ask you if you wanted to be Jewish or not. You were raised Jewish and indoctrinated with our ways. Unfortunately in your stream of Judaism Payos is a very important feature and value. By cutting them short you are sending them a scary signal that you are departing from their values. For some parents depending on how liberal they are this could indeed be pretty scary.So you need to weigh the pros amp cons. On the one hand you make a stand and get your way on the other hand you scare and worry you parents and you send a message to them and to the rest of your social circles that you are different rebellious etc.Even if there is no substance to those claims you need to understand it scares them on a deep level they may not even know how to explain it to you or to themselves. They have always done it a certain way and deviating from that way is scary different and thus it is Muktse.Good luck brother!,Judaism,cxhjgg0,1,t5_2qi67

5835720,0,t1_cxkj1il,Genuine Kabbalahs acceptance is so widespread that many of the accepted leaders of our current generation across Litvish Chasidish and Sefardi lines have affirmed it not only as an essential component of Torah Judaism albeit not necessarily one appropriate for study by everybody but even arguing that rejecting genuine Kabbalah is in fact heretical.This has been the general consensus throughout the centuries with the leaders of the generation investigating whatever new texts or scholars might arise and concluding that they are correct.  Its only really in our generation that certain groups often claiming to be rationalists or rambamists have attempted to argue that Kabbalah is not authentic etc.  Their views are not widely accepted in mainstream orthodox Judaism.As for a definition Kabbalah is an extremely broad subject that delves into the process by which the universe was created the means by which the Infinite Creator can interact meaningfully with a finite creation and how our actions in this world have an impact on higher planes of existence and how those actions can eventually effect a substantial change on our physical world by drawing it closer to Gd.,Judaism,cxkl8uw,0,t5_2qi67

Do you have a support system and a supportive rabbi youre comfortable engaging with? Thats key bro sis?. No woman is an island and Judaism is a communal religion which is why its so hard to do it in isolation. Id also encourage you to keep exploring. Spend time in various communities if you can until you find one that feels like home.

Right.Are you seriously insinuating that I am incapable of making a nuanced argument?... Im not even mad DgtWhats sharper than direct quotes from Rambam himselfIm not sure you leads you to believe I an disputing the quoted lines.The specific facts I originally challenged are that the Rambam was not paid attention to outside of a small circle after his lifetime that Rav Yosef Karos authority rests on claims of prophecy or magic that Rav Yosef Karo diverged from Rambams universally accepted rulings.Those were the main ones there may have been one or two others but its not worth going back again to check.These things are not a matter of interpretation. Even the most academic or proMaimonidean or antiKabbalistic or whatever metric of legitimacy you choose to use scholar will agree that your statements in this regard are simply counterfactual.I challenged your interpretation of the text you quote as well and I am not the most learned person here to have done so but I tried to make it clear that it is a matter of interpretation rather than verifiable fact.gt Had we been in person you wouldve warranted being hitltdeep breathsgtgtgt Impacted the pointgtWha?I thought the  points I was addressing were peripheral to the point you are trying to make so addressing them did not in my mind constitute attempting to refute you or criticising your argument.gtYou were the one that posted on my postWere we not supposed to?

I singled out the paragraphs you quoted so that others could read just the parts you intended.But sometimes people prefer to see things in context even when they trust the source. Its not only a question of trust its a question of getting the full picture which may or may not be relevant to or implied by the quoted text accurate as it may be.

I feel ready to take the next steps toward converting. I read everything you recommended last year and arranged to learn Hebrew at the JCC. Could we please get together sometime soon to talk about what Ive learned and how I should move forward?But dont do that if your schedule is so overwhelming that you wont be able to engage in the next steps which would probably be the Hebrew another class andor regular meetings. Instead talk to the rabbi and explain that youre not flaking out just slowing down for a while. Basically what you told us  youre not in a hurry and dont want to rush to convert until you can give it . But be very appreciative of the time and attention hes given you and make sure he knows youll still be involved in the community.If he doesnt respond positively then it might be a good idea to look for another rabbi to learn with once youre ready to move forward.

6677019,0,t1_d09brg6,I think you are looking at the past with an anachronistic perspective. It is certainly true that there have always been Jews who remained part of the Jewish community even when they were not fully observant and in certain times and places this population was quite substantial. However these less observant Jews rarely if ever claimed to represent a distinct from of Judaism that had its own legitimacy. If the laws of kashrus were widely neglected in a particular community the people of that community didnt claim that this was their legitimate practice. This is still true in the Orthodox world. For example there are many Orthodox synagogues where it is commonplace for congregants to engage in conversation and gossip throughout the services despite the fact that this is explicitly forbidden in halacha yet none of these synagogues claims that this is their minhag. One could name many other examples of this. And of course throughout history it has been the role of rabbis and prophets in Biblical times to look for these problem areas and to admonish the people to fix their ways. In premodern Europe in addition to the local rabbis there were also many itinerant preachers maggidim who would travel from town to town and village to village and admonish the people for whatever such errors they saw in the community. These speeches were usually attended by the entire community and sometimes had a dramatic effect.What has changed in modern times is that today such semiobservant but still nominally Orthodox Jews will often take offense at any suggestion that what they are doing is wrong.

7232012,0,t1_d1zzfgp,Regarding what Hartman answers in his own book were in the same boat. But I think I can comment on some of your excellent questions. Ill start at the end. You wonder if there is a difference between putting God second and declaring God is dead. One thing I really liked about this interview was how Mark Golubs nontheistic views contrasted with Hartmans more religious ones. That created a refreshing thread throughout where Hartman implicitly criticized the common ReformConservative tendency to paper over the more ugly parts of tradition. In my understanding the living and notalways moral God is far preferable to the dead God because the for the religious the former is forever in mind compelling one to reexamine their moral choices. A dead God exerts no such effect. As for whether a philosophical system could do this job I will hedge a bit. First a secular outlook might achieve much of the same outcomes. But I dont think that would be long lasting or sustainable. Religion unlike philosophy can reach further to the emotional core of a person affecting their identity and sense of connectedness etc. Sorry. I irrationally dislike the word spirituality Notably it is transmitted personally to descendants.To wit a secular person doesnt have to wonder about why a loving God would command his loyal follower to sacrifice Issac. But even a nontheisticunobservant Jew is compelled to at least briefly wonder.   There was a Why be Jewish post? that went up before Shabbat that I never finished writing. But perhaps I could selfplagarize a bitgtWhy be Jewish? Depending on what you think the question is there may or may not be an answer. In any case it might also be unsatisfying. gtHeres my two cents There are I cant even call them values more like parameters in a process that creates values that can only come from a perspective that has its roots in a particular kind of historical memory. When people talk about tradition its easy to pick out superficial particulars like bagels smelly unlovable pickled fish love of booklearning or even ethics. But thats not what tradition is. gtTradition is embodied living knowledge. It cant just be picked up like a recipe for ethnic food or an abstract theory. In Judaism this knowledge is maintained and supported on several levels with much of it being action and behaviorally oriented as well as discussion and endless literary exegesis etc. Regardless of ones theological position on exactly how they came to be or how one should be observing them this is what mitzvot accomplish. Telescoping out to the communal level this produces a culture of people who are predisposed to a hyperactive level of ethical behavior and intellectual inquiry.PS Did it seem for the briefest moment that Golub would invert the usual question and ask if one can be moral AND religious? Instead of can one be ethical amp non religiousEDIT minor corrections clarifying parenthetical sentence at the end,Judaism,d20863s,1,t5_2qi67

Circumcision for men doesnt really do this. How I look at it if Germans dont like circumcision they dont need to do it.

Being circumcised reduces your risk of infection and disease and its easier to clean. gtAnd the difference between vaccination to protect against diseases and transmission and circumcision to protect against diseases and transmission is that vaccination protects against involuntary contraction and transmission of diseases whereas to contract and transmit a disease as a result of being uncircumcised is not considering rape voluntary requiring sexual intercourse.Uncircumcised men who arent properly clean could be spreading diseases to women or causing vaginal infections.gtUsing lotion means we have to buy lotion. I dont know if lotion does anything harmful to the penis either but it may. It means we have a lot more to clean up afterwards.

And how is circumcision not also a deliberate infliction of physical injury?Because I wouldnt consider a piercing or circumcision to be an injury. gtRaping a baby is inflicting your desire on a baby a harmful desire without its consent.

The getting together to do it is mainly to form a minyan a prayer quorum. A chazan sings scripture and there is often a sermon but thats not an everyday thing. Its not lead by a rabbi like a church service is lead by a reverend or priest. Women pray as well and do so out loud most parts some are silent to both genders and sermons and stuff like that can be given by them. They just cant be part of a minyan and stuff like that and are thus excluded from taking part in that. Not because people are conservative but because the law prohibits it.

7970801,0,t1_d4byp3v,I really already did or do you also not know how law works in every civilised country?Orthodox Judaism does not and no interpretation of Judaism that has ever been recorded dies interpret the many verses in the Bible that say that someone should die or deserves death as a permission for any standerby to execute the person involved. Theres a whole complex section of law on due process which is even more strenuous in capital cases.With one vanishingly rare and one slightly less rare exception executing a criminal without due process is nothing short of murder just as imprisoning someone in the US is nothing short of kidnapping and worse Im sure even if you can personally prove that that person has committed a criminal act.There is no reasonable interpretation of Jewish law at any point in history that would give sanction to the murder of fifty people just because they happen to be in a place.And we dont actually believe that anyone should die. Even when a court does execute someone which was extremely rare it is with regret and when there is no other choice it is not something to be celebrated. As Ezekiel quotes emphatically As I livedeclares the Lord GODit is not My desire that the wicked shall die but that the wicked turn from his evil ways and live.Besides for the assumption that were stupid or that we live with a miraculous degree of selfdeception or cognitive dissonance or that we have not seriously considered our own foundational texts all of which simple empirical enquiry would demonstrate to be false and specious its bigoted beyond belief to insist that any rightthinking Orthodox Jew might feel anything but horrified at this mass murder.

I am not a pathetic being that needs other people to treat me like a wounded animal.gtMany people believe that your interpretation of Halacha is wrong or that Halacha is less than infalliable or indeed that God does not exist at all.Its not my interpretation.  This is authentic Judaism.  I didnt write the rules. I just live by them.  And not believing in God is one thing.  If they struggle to believe struggle with the concept thats more authentically Jewish than anything else.gtIts ludicrous to expect them to become frum JewsIm not saying people need to frum up.  Frum life isnt for everyone.

Its also my right to say that I do not recognize forms of Judaism that deny the divinity of the Torah as valid streams of Judaism.gtAlso its downright hilarious to me that you seem to lump the MO in as insufficiently pious.That wasnt my intention.  Im sharing an anecdote of things Ive seen by people in my community.  However Im not an asshole.  Im not going to be a guest in your house and give you a check list of ways you violate the sabbath.  I know plenty of MO people who are machpid on their halakha as well.  Those are not the ones Im referring to.  My point is that on what wed consider to be the lighter end of the stream of strict observance and I used televisions as a sign of what this lightness looks like to make a point that these are orthodox Jews who will recite the first Mishna from Pirkei Avot to back up torah emet but then disassociate their belief in Torah with their social issue sympathies.  That was my intention and I apologize if that wasnt clear at first.gtFinally the phrase JINO is phenomenally offensive. What gives you the right to define what makes someone a real Jew?Never have I acted as if I hold right to anything.  Youre very accusatory and are making me feel very unwelcome to this sub.  All I do is follow the rules of Judaism.  I have family members who are casually religious outside the orthodox context and will go eat a cheeseburger.  Then they talk about how theyre Jewish or theyre offended because someone crossed their Judaism.  Im sorry but how can they be offended when their Judaism is insulted when they insult their own Judaism all the time by eating treifot?  They know full well they arent supposed to but their response is that the burger tastes so good.  They even giggle about the sin and say its okay its not like we go to hell for it.Im a firm believer in that we have a right to speak on the matters that pertain to us.  I am orthodox and gay.  These are aspects of my identity.  They matter globally.  I also eat a mostly vegan diet.  Ive had vegans tell me Im not vegan enough and Ive had vegetarians and meat eaters call me foolish for choosing the things I want to eat.  If you want to insult me on my eating habits so be it but I dont intend to portray my diet as an authentic vegan diet.  I dont claim to represent all vegans or any food eating group for that matter.  However when Jews want to twist Judaism to permit their sin thats when Im going to get vocal.  Thats a matter that actually means something because the more Jews who want to paint homosexual activity as not a sin makes those of us who observe the Torah look like bigots.  Im not a bigot.  I dont hate anyone needlessly.  But ignorant morons will look at people like me and since I dont telegraph my sexuality theyll call me a cis gendered white male peddling the patriarchy through my archaic religion.

8042083,0,t1_d4jwn41,Ive never seen that before to be the case. If that has been your experience Im willing to bet that is was the exception to the rule not the norm. In fact  when I visited my friend in Albany the lubuvichers all daven at an old shul that started as yeki askenaz and even though there are only a few members from the old shul and the majority daven ari when the chazan goes up he is expected to daven the old nusach. In west Hempstead there are several different shuls but the recognized rav of the community is the young Israel rabbis. And none of the other community rabbis make a move outside their shul without consulting the rav. Last year during sukkos when there was high wind the rav sent out an email telling people that they should take down their schach for safety reasons. Although it is chabad custom to eat in the sukkah pretty much no matter what the shliach there did not protest.  He simply asked that his name not be included in the memo.  The final email that was sent to the community by the rav was signed by all the community rabbis with a note on the bottom stating that those still wishing to eat in the sukkah should go to chabad. Of note is that people continued to use the eruv that shabbos. It seems to me that if the wind is bad enough to warrant taking down the sukkah it should be assumed that the eruv is down also.

You can explain or describe how any of that happens in whatever terms you like as far as Im concerned. There might be shades of substantial difference but by and large different metaphors appeal to different people.gt the evergrowing rationalist mindset of st century JewsFTFY The currently fashionable scientistic materialism that has gained a foothold among Jews as all intellectual trends do.gt but is returning to a Temple period with animal sacrifice important for the goal of Jewish practice at all?Youve said what you think is the explanation most nonharedi orthodox jews give for religion and I cant tell you what most nonharedi orthodox jews think. But dont you think that as Orthodox Jews and even more so as thinking Orthodox Jews we should try to understand the overarching themes of Torah and reasons for specific Mitzvot from the Mitzvot as they are rather than deciding a priori what Mitzvot should be about and then deciding which ones fit within our framework?The fact that the halocha is that we will return to all Temple services when we are able to is sufficient for me to say that it is important for the goal of Jewish practice. If someone gives a reason for Mitzvot or a Mitzvah which obviates any part of the Halachah then that reason must be incorrect.But anyway I dont see why you dont think that sacrifices should be a part of a culture devoted towards moral growth and control over base desires. Are moral growth and control over base desires among the reasons for the sacrifical services?And if you dont think they are important for moral growth and control over base desires than why did God give them in the first place?

My MIL is certainly part of her community but she has a more rigid personality and is less social so shes given herself fewer opportunities to learn certain things or acquire certain habits that other people find to be second nature after being in the game for a similar amount of time.

8116087,0,t1_d4sauq6,gt Why is that misleading? That is simply another contradiction to this case.Its misleading because youre arguing that SCOTUS says abortion cant be regulated. I assumed you were embellishing for rhetorical reasons but at face value its flatout not true. Theyve upheld regulations multiple times that do not impose an undue burden on the ability of women to obtain an abortion. If the Texas law had say subjected abortion clinics to healthsafety inspections and required them to have outlined plans for what to do in the case of various medical emergencies it would almost certainly still be in place in fact I wouldnt be surprised to hear those are already the law though Im not about to go looking.gt I cant even. have admitting privileges at a hospital is completely relevant to a medical procedure such as abortion. I cant I just cant. You are objectively wrong and intellectually dishonest right here.gt As for guns dont give me that bs in NYC they effectively regulated guns out of existence.gt They regulate property rights without regard to relevancy or safety all the time. They are definitely undue burdens far greater than these. The argument is preposterous.Im not sure what you think is intellectually dishonest here. Texas was given a chance to prove its relevancy and could not. They were asked if there was any case in Texas where the law would have improved treatment for women and they said that no such case existed. Simply being medical doesnt mean its relevant. The regulation made no more sense than requiring all abortion providers to be dentists or all dentists to have admitting privileges  after all both are medical. Whether you believe this to be true is irrelevant because no connection between this law and medical outcomes was shown to exist at trial.As someone who lived in Chicago when SCOTUS struck down its handgun ban  and where federal courts recently struck down laws prohibiting the sale but not ownership already struck down by SCOTUS of firearms within the city limit  Im guessing that NYC has not managed to regulate guns out of existence. Im not sure why you think the undue burden standard is preposterous other than on the basis of thinking abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right in the first place.gt I doubt the national guard or the military would stand with the government on contrived constitutional crap made up from the bench if you think they would take a poll of the military to see where they stand on the issue. Even a child can tell that this stuff is made up from the bench you dont have to be one of the dissenting judges to understand that.The idea that the military is going to override the US Constitution by ignoring the Supreme Court and the President and quite possibly Congress and save the day by enforcing a particular set of political beliefs is a fantasy. If this was going to happen it would have happened over desegregation not over a state shutting down abortion clinics.

8251556,0,t1_d58eg0f,You can argue that many jews are disconnected from their roots because most jewish strands have not adopted to contemporary life but instead refused it.As in the orthodox secular split as a result of modernity and the enlightment.Many secular Jewish people feel that judaism is anachronistic. Sure very closed communities that close themselves exactly for fear of assimilation might carry on but is there really no way to integrate judaism with contemporary life? Is judaism really defined simply by self exclusion?Contemporary life is much faster society changes much quicker which is definitely a challenge but is the only answer to refuse changes as oppose to integrating them?I obviously agree that judaism and jews should remain distinct and yet I dont think we should be completely separate but rather a somewhat different and changed look at life but not in the way of refusing change just incorporating it in a jewish sense.What does that mean? For israel it simply means processing things making laws directing culture while always looking at the history of judaism and jews taking it into account.Your question about what I think is the message of judaism is exactly what I was asking about. How should future judaism look. Israel by definition as a sovereign jewish state is already separated from other nations. How to make sure that it remains jewish? IMO by investing in jewish thought reinterpretation and bringing contemporary life and knowledge together with ancient jewish texts to asnwer the demands of a modern state and people.Bringing judaism to the forefront in an integrated way appropriate for a jewish state.But IMO what we need is a sober look and reinterpretation of jewish texts. The text itself will always remain as it was but it makes total sense that in a time of quick change and acceleration interpretation also become more fluid and fast.There is simply no comparing the fact that in contemporary life change is the prevalent occurrence while stability is the rarity while before it was exactly the opposite.In Israel I think the role of rabbis should be rethought. Judaism needs to be fully integrated into the state but for that it must be able to confront and address all modern issues that are important to a modern state.As in a return to an actual jewish state but with a judaism that is flexible and that looks at itself as a means to incorporate and integrate necessary ideas while also criticizing them.A more democratic judaism if you willso integrate democracy into judaism not judaism into democracy that looks at its sources not as dogma that must be followed but as a guide to preserve for contemporary jews that somewhat different and specific jewish view on life that through its historical and cultural power can contends with all the new ideas from acorss the world meeting them head on.,Judaism,d5900xa,1,t5_2qi67

8400271,0,t3_4uozpm,Many articles have been written defending this or that modern system on the basis of Torah. All of them cherrypick.The Torah including the interpretation of the Talmud of course provides its own regulatory principles which do not  perfectly conform perfectly to any of the systems you mentioned or others that Im aware of.We must support the Kohanim as in a Socialist system but unlike in Socialism the distribution of support is neither  centralised nor necessarily equitable. A more popular family could get a greater share of priestly gifts.As in Communism we relinquish our personal rights to certain property eg the corners of our field. However unlike in Communism this is only temporary and ownership of land as well as most other property not only persists but even reverts periodically to its ancestral owners.As in Capitalism personal property rights are fiercely defended  various forms of theft and damage some quite subtle are treated at length. Unlike in pure anarchoCapitalism various taxes are extracted and the court or the monarchy can more or less arbitrarily confiscate your property if they deem it necessary.I cant think of any ways in which the Torah system is Fascistic or State Capitalistic but it does provide virtually unlimited powers to the king so I guess a tyrannical king could enforce as much central government as he wanted to. But on the other hand there is no builtin system forcing anyone into one or other industry and as long as they arent extortionate theres no upper or lower limit on pricing or other business practices.For every argument that the Torah supports one system we know about there is another that it definitely doesnt. So the conclusion must be that the Torah supports the Torah system which takes several tractates to fully lay out of carefully balanced regulations providing just the right amount of power and protection to each party in Gods eyes.I dont think it can even be said that the Torah system has an overriding economic aim like lifting people out of poverty we cant let them starve but theres nothing but an encouragement of kindness to keep people out of poverty even for generations or stimulating growth growth is permitted but frequently must take a backseat to spiritual goals or maintaining equality  either of outcomes or of opportunity.

Its not even called the Holocaust or the Shoah its Churban Europa to put it in line with the other Churbans. I guess in a way its the feeling that most Jews really obsess over the Holocaust making it a massive part of being Jewish. For the frum community for the most part being Jewish is about the Torah. All of Jewish history is viewed through the lens of the Torah. So when you read about Shabbetai Tzvi you relate it to the longing for Moshiach and how that can dangerously overwhelm logic when you learn about Salonika you hear how Jews shouldered the responsibility of closing ports on Shabbos despite the financial loss and when the Holocaust is taught the context is In every generation they stand upon us to destroy us the stories of faith in the most turbulent times and how no matter how assimilated a Jew was the Nazis still came for them.,Judaism,d6k5min,5,t5_2qi67

Its noncontributing if the thread is whats the Reform answer to X but that doesnt make it intolerant or rude. I think thats generally pretty okay. But I also know there are people who hide behind the label of Im just giving the Orthodox opinion while doing things that I think are unacceptable. For instance a user suggesting that another user who is a Conservative convert ought not to be considered when they complain about the attitude in this sub because they are a Conservative convert and therefore not Jewish. I saw that happen just today. The post might not have technically violated any rules maybe  since its a catchall depending on how it was phrased but I saw it and I got mad. I admit that I didnt report it mods I will if you like because I didnt think it was toeing the line close enough to get attention but I still think it was inappropriate. The issue is that the intolerant people take advantage of the tolerant. Im not sure how to stymie that.,Judaism,d70sms5,3,t5_2qi67

8824299,0,t3_511gg8,I agree with everything you just said. Here are a few reasons for the movements rise as I see it that might help contextualize further It is also important to see the altright in context of the current cultural climate We exist in a world where more groups of people are more rapidly accepted for themselves than ever before. Discriminating against someone for their race religion sexuality gender and on and on are all things that modern society is trying hard to eliminate. Part of the reason the altright has support right now is because people whose identitiesbelief systems are built on the prejudices at the basis of those discrimination realize their time is limited. As a result it doesnt matter which part of that list you hate. People who hate blacks people who dont want gays to marry people who think feminism is about unfair advantages instead of an equal standing and so on are all finding a home in this movement because it is a movement about anger and bringing back what was only more virulently and powerfully than before. The guys and yes it is almost all guys who hate Jews are along for the ride with guys who hate all those other groups and theyre building off and mimicking each others hatreds and biases as well. Thats one big reason that the altright has power that individual bigoted groups dont have.Another is that as a result of this the altright can cover its true motives. They can say its not about women its not about Jews because they do have other issues they stand for... its just that those issues are as bigoted and hateful as the ones you brought up initially. Together each individual altright principle can hide itself somewhat they can also say this is just about not being politically correct while ignoring the fact that sometimes its not about things being PC its about them being wrong. Lastly one of the great misconceptions about political conservativism is that it means change is impossible or undesirable. Being conservative is about being cautious in the face of change not refusing it but the Republican party has embraced the idea that conservatism means never ever giving any ground or changing on anything. Thats whats allowed the altright to so capture it in my opinion. The reason Jews should be against the altright and people who supportencourage them like the Republican nominee but by no means only him is not just because theyre antiSemitic. Its because they are antiprogress. They dont want society to move forward even cautiously they want to turn the clock back. They dont want to bury the axe they want to pull it out and start whacking away. History has rarely been kind to the Jews we live now in a period that believe it or not is better and safer for us than much of the time that came before. The altright would undo that. ,Judaism,d78k4or,8,t5_2qi67

8880014,0,t1_d7f34md,Maybe proselytize is an inappropriate term. Most of us do associate that term with a model used by Christians Muslims to spread etc. However it seems pretty uncontroversial to acknowledge the Judaism of the Second Temple amp TannaiticAmoraic periods were a lot more porous to converts than any time since. There was also the one instance of the forcible conversion of the Idumeans by John Hyrcanus.Practically Im not sure if its a term academics of Jewish history would use to describe the way gentiles came to Judaism in late antiquity. But even if they do its not clear if were talking about the same things. Their definition might be a lot more technical FWIW My personal view is very firmly against seeking more converts in any general fashion. Reform Judaism should more strongly emphasize raising Jewish children etc. This has already leads to a certain appetite for conversion on its own which institutions should concentrate on. I think any generalized practice of outreach risks destroying very important qualities in Judaism. ,Judaism,d7f93we,1,t5_2qi67

9028023,0,t3_53vrja,Im in a somewhat similar situation. Im not quite decided on belief in God or which aspects of Judaism Im going to adhere to although for the most part I keep kosher I eat out dairy but no meat. Similar to what someone else said I do it mostly out of respect for tradition. My grandparents entire families were wiped out in the Holocaust because they were Jewish and kept kosher. They so strongly believed that it was the right thing to do I can just imagine the disappointment theyd have if they knew I was able to be Jewish freely but chose not to keep Kosher. Aside from guilt though I also tend to agree that its not necessarily so much more than an inconvenience but it does definitely help with self control. I realize my arguments are based somewhat on fallacies and dont necessarily make the most sense but if keeping Kosher is what feels right to you then I think it is something you should stick with. ,Judaism,d7x0yiw,3,t5_2qi67

9105803,0,t3_54zo6c,Speaking as an Orthodox Jew Im torn between telling you to find your own meaning in performing whatever mitzvot you feel called to do and wanting to keep you from treating them as a matter of personal taste. Simply telling someone to believe  or to act as if they do  doesnt really bear any kind of worthwhile fruit but I want all Jews to feel connected to their heritage and I believe that a mitzvah is a mitzvah even if the inspiration to perform it isnt always optimal from an Orthodox perspective. So this isnt an easy question to answer in an unambiguously honest way.When it comes down to it though youre Jewish. It doesnt matter whether you like gefilte fish or fasted last Yom Kippur its still who and what you are. Which means youre part of our family and are entitled to participate in family matters however you can. It might mean you dont come around as often as some of your other cousins do or that well fight over different things when we do get together but the ties that bind us  to each other and to Gd  will always be there. Personally I like to focus on those points of connection even when the points of separation seem too wide to overcome. Find your points of connection to Judaism and to Jews and keep them strong. Without that youll never even have the chance to figure yourself out further. And wed really miss you because kol Yisrael areivim zeh lazeh.,Judaism,d86ddqy,9,t5_2qi67

Im aware of them but cant vouch specifically for themtheir pricestheir quality because I havent ever bought from them myself. I know they have a store in the old city of Jerusalem they might also have elsewhere  Anyway back to the judaica. The question is partly what do you need so you can buy something youll use and then also if you want it as a memento maybe to go in the direction of more ornamental things. So for example theres a ton of beautiful shabbos options   board for challah challah cover havdalah set etc etc. You could get a mezuzah.  You could get a pretty washing cup. You could get a menorah a rosh Hashanah apple dipping set a seder plate etc etc. Tallit is a good practical idea easy to get here. My family regularly stocks up on kippot when they visit as well. the adults favor very closely and finely knitted black kippot and the good ones are really hard to find elsewhere but the selection for kids kippot is also better here Do you live somewhere its relatively easyhard to buy Jewish equipment? Would you be interested in less keepsakey not particularly expensive but handy to have stuff like say stickers for kitchen equipment meatdairypareve or a washing cup with a cover for morning hand washing?

9220068,0,t3_56jmo8,gtMany orthodox Christian sects hold that in our sin we are dead that sin has brought both physical and spiritual death. Salvation by the grace of God then is the only way to be saved from the death that sin brings.The only way to be saved from sin is to repent from sin and improve your ways. No amount of salvation from God will save a man who refuses to save himself. What we do have as a concept is that sometimes overcoming challenges can be too hard to do without divine assistance. Hence we can pray for help from God to do the right thing. Note also that in Christianity sin seems to be some kind of state. In Judaism theres simply... Sinning. Its not that you exist in a state of sinfulness or whatever. You can sin or not sin. And there is not a single person who is totally free from sin. Which is okay because God accepts that we are going to make mistakes and He gives us the pathway to learn from them and improve. of possible relevance is that true repentance turns sins into merits. That is if you truly learned from and regretted your misdeeds if the mistake you made was the trigger for setting you on a better path and helped you become a better person then now it is no longer something that distances you from God but rather something that has brought you closer... I think it is possibly helpful to bear in mind that at the end of the day all these concepts are simply about a relationship with God. If you are married when your spouse hurts you or does something nice for you that isnt being dead or being saved. Its simply a matter of whether your relationship is closerwarmer or distantcolder. And just like it is possible for a spouse to apologize sincerely and for you to forgive them so to with God only God doesnt hold grudges and is generally more forgivingpatientetc than humans generally are ,Judaism,d8kplxz,3,t5_2qi67

9403187,0,t3_59eil4,I wonder how much of this is driven by the perception that gentiles arent welcome in Jewish communities. I cant count how many gentiles have asked if its OK for them to even attend a synagogue service if they dont intend to convert. Then theres the taboo against intermarriage and rabbinic refusal to officiate them. So they learn early on that Christian ministers are more welcoming and open. Why would couples try to raise Jewish children when they think the Jewish community wont accept a mixed family? The Jewish community is viewed by many gentiles as closed off and exclusionary despite attempts by many to be open and welcoming. Intermarriage doesnt have to be a death sentence to the Jewish community. If Jewish identity were more diffuse if intermarriage wasnt taboo if rabbis and synagogues were more welcoming to intermarried couples intermarriage could help grow the Jewish community. ,Judaism,d97x5kl,-1,t5_2qi67

Orthodox Judaism will be a problem for a gay man.

Maybe this will change over the next generation who knows?There are also a growing number of independent communities communities with no official affiliation which tend to be conservative in many areas of observance and quite liberal on many social issues.  If you have a community like this in your area this may be a good match if you are someone who eventually wants to end up in a learned mostly observant community i.e. most people are keeping Shabbat keeping kosher can read Hebrew etc. but one which will welcome you and your family.

9791850,0,t1_dajscv2,This JEDP idea was the theory of one Julius Wellhausen May    January    a German and son of a Protestant minister and Karl Heinrich Graf February    July   also a German Protestant.   These mens education was at the hands of other Protestant theologians including Georg Heinrich August Ewald of the th century.  Graf and Wellhausen seemed to have been a product of their antiSemitic th century German world. Graf  Wellhausen based their theory on the fact that because the bible uses two names for Gd there are actually far more than two! there must have been a merging of two gods  two religions.  They thought that Moses could not have written the Torah thus lessening its value  because the Torah uses the Tetragrammaton holiest name and elohim which means a mighty judge  ruler and is used to speak of Gd false gods angels and even humans to speak of Gd.   They decided that since there were two names there had to be different authors.  This theory divides the Torah into four separate sources J. J is for jehovah a made up name since there are no j sounds in Hebrew  but this would be Gds holiest four letter name the Tetragrammaton. E. E is where the title elohim is used to describe Gd.   There is not much text from E in the JEDP and it supposedly comes from the northern kingdom of Israel not the southern kingdom of Judah. D. D is Deuteronomy. D is thought to be composed during King Josiahs reign s  ish BCE. D is a pure legal code that exalts Jerusalem. P. P is the Priestly text. It was thought to be the latest postExile  BCE forward and focuses on Temple related priestly rituals. Um.Did anyone bother to explain to Wellhausen that the names for Gd are really descriptions?  For example elohim   a word used to speak of humans angels false gods and Gd means a mighty judge.  The word adon   means a lord or master and so on. . .  Although many Christians are taught the JEDP as if it is fact it has actually been disproved by archeology  which shows that there is historical proof for the Torah and nach dating much farther back than there theories would contend. On Bible Criticism and its Counter Arguments from Torah Emet  Umberto Cassuto  and Yechezkel Kaufman  further demolished the theory showing that Wellhausens observations contradicted his conclusions. Kaufmans main contribution lies in his thesis that monotheism was not as Wellhausen and others had stated a gradual departure from paganism but an entirely new development. Israels monotheism began with Moshe and was a complete revolution in religious thought. . .Special mention should be made of the famous archaeologist William F. Alright.   He convincingly demonstrated that archaeological research did not support and in fact often contradicted this view of history. In many of his works Albright destroyed the very foundations upon which Wellhausens edifice had been erected. . .In his classic work Critique of Religion and Philosophy Princeton NJ Princeton University Press  p.  Walter Kaufmann discusses Wellhausens as well as other forms of Higher Criticism and shows one of the major failures of these schools in the following observation    Imagine a Higher Critic analyzing Goethes Faust which was written by a single human being in the course of sixty years. The scenes in which the heroine of Part One is called Gretchen would be relegated to one author the conflicting conceptions of the role of Mephistopheles would be taken to call for further divisions and the Prologue in Heaven would be ascribed to a later editor while the prelude on the stage would be referred to yet a different author. Our critic would have no doubt whatsoever that Part Two belongs to a different age and must be assigned to a great many writers with widely different ideas. The end of Act IV for example points to an antiCatholic author who lampoons the church while the end of Act V was written by a man we should be told who though probably no orthodox Catholic was deeply sympathetic to Catholicism. Where do we find more inconsistencies in style and thought and plan in Goethes Faust or in the Five Books of Moses?. . .What can be said with certainty is that honest Bible scholars no longer maintain that the Torah is the result of different fragments edited and reedited. The Torah is now taken to be Mosaic in origin and content and it has been acknowledged that much of this tradition was already well established in proMosaic times. Although this position has moved considerably in the direction of the Jewish traditional view it has definitely not thrown in the towel to the tradition concerning the verbal infallibility of the Torah. . .One of GrafWellhausens main points was that the Torah wasnt written until after the Babylonian Exile.   Archelogical discoveries in Israel alone disprove this  as does the discovery of the silver scrolls shown in the image for this post from   which contain the priestly blessing from Bamidbar Numbers. The silver scrolls have been dated to about  BCE and their very existence destroys a major contention of the JEDP theory.Our  masorah along with the written Torah tells us that we Jews have ransmitted the Torah and its history from generation to generation in an unbroken line.  Unlike most religions where someone supposedly saw something communicated one on one with Gd with no witnesses or passed on stories to anonymous followers Judaism is based on the  million eye and ear witnesses at Sinai who heard Gd speak and who then told their children and their childrens children from that generation to this one.In an unbroken line.,Judaism,dak23u3,2,t5_2qi67
9800312,0,t3_5fkwwb,during the medieval period not much has changedJews prospered during that timeBoth of these are largely incorrect although it varied a lot by location and time.  But generally as the middle ages went by you had the spread of Christianity through Europe the codification of feudalism the dispersal of small groups of Jews founding new to them communities the consolidation of power of the Catholic church increasing association among Christians between the Jews and dark magicthe Devil increasing economic isolation and exclusion from various trades and guilds the Crusades the Black Death forced conversions multiple mass expulsions and the Inquisition. Overall not a cheery time to be Jewish especially after the tenth century.So what were some common community dilemmas? Under feudalism most Jewish communities had their own charters that outlined their legal relationship with other stratified groups in the area. Social institutions had to be organized within the community courts policing schools charity banking etc. Only if a Jew got into conflict with a Gentile would it be handled by a nonJewish court for instance. So problems would be stuff like The blacksmithing guild is colliding with the local lord to forbid Jews from that trade! Quick send a delegation with bribes! Its the tradition to throw some dirt over our shoulders on the way back from a funeral but some Gentiles saw this and thought we were hexing them! What do? How can we make it through Passover without anybody getting beaten upkilled? Somebody take the temperature of the streets see if okay to walk outside or not. My sailor husbands ship never returned! Can I remarry? What other community resources can I fall back on to support the family? I mean my daughters dowry isnt going to pay for itself. Weve got a lot of poor people in town. How do we fairly collect this ridiculous tax that we collectively owe? Studying Torah is great!  except it doesnt put food on the table. How do we support our scholars? Who should we support  like just anyone? Because that Shlomo makes a mean biali but he cant tell his alef from his bet. Im a Jewish doctor and despite my best efforts my patient died. Now the family says I poisoned him! Leave town now or suck it up and take possible kiddushin to protect the rest of the community?

9928493,0,t3_5hgh85,The Jewish take on meditation like many things is hard to summarize except to say that it doesnt have anything that  corresponds. Many will say that prayer contains much of the essence of what in somewhat secular terms we would think of as meditative. especially so when it comes to concentrating during prayer or having intent. Others might bring up various kabbalistic concepts that somewhat correspond but not exactly. IIRC theres discussions about character traits so a person could cultivate being mindfully contemplativebut with the appreciation that one needs to balance this out with an attentiveness to action. Back to your question meditation as we often conceive of it in the West doesnt exactly exist as one single concept in the east. There are many many different techniques and practices most of which arent practiced by lay people. What we think of as meditation is in many ways a secularizedAmericanised distillationreconstruction of different practices. Id say the same about yoga The upshot of this is that for us Jews is that we have a lot of neat ideas in classical texts but no concise roadmap or conceptual framework for how to apply them. So my approach is to read up on these simplified but effective practices to get a sense of the science that makes mindfulness work. And then just to practice. This means making time to practice say a breathing exercise or to try to pause your identification with your thoughts to examine them and see how complicated they are. One effective way to do this is to pay attention to how granular bodily states are For ex. your inner monologue says Im so angry I cant believe xyz. Instead of following the inner voice rant just make a note of what you are feeling. Hmm...Theres a lot of anger. Wow this anger its this whole process. My back gets tense blood feels rushing through me and then I notice pain. The pain itself is shock and disbelief which gives to vulnerability and then disgust. And then I notice the tension and the blood rush again.  Once one is practiced enough then it gets to be easier to stop a recurrent thought or reframe an unhelpful state. Semitangentially the idea of enlightenment probably does more harm than good. There is nothing otherworldly going on here. And more importantly in terms of expectations meditation will not make anyone immune to sadness anger etc. The goal is just to better manage these states. ,Judaism,db1phtp,2,t5_2qi67

I always wondered Well the Pharisees were right that you need to wash your hands before ya eat but its not like its their business if Jesus wasnt hygienic anyway. I had no idea it was about ritual purity and etc. I freaked out. When Jesus does the water to wine thing he does it out of keilim for handwashing! I do it all of the time now and I never understood the significance. The scene at the wedding is basically a set of washing stations before bread like youll see at shuls. They held  to  gallons so its obvious they would get water out with a smaller vessel and do it.Also baptism probably has roots in the mikvah ritual but Im not sure. The idea of needing baptism to convert strikes familiar.Jesus being wrapped in linen before burial. Chanting the Torah in the synagogue. Even the haftorah. Jesus literally quotes the Shma saying Whats the greatest commandment? insert Shma here He knew they couldnt disagree with that. Most people werent literate therefore choosing it was rhetorically brilliant. It wasnt a passage that people wouldnt have known off the bat. Christians arent always aware. Most think wow cant believe they didnt know that. Jesus really taught them something mean Pharisees didnt even know. Thats an actual view. He only said it since they did know it! When the Jews run out with palm fronds and say Hosanna! Hosanna! its basically Sukkot. Jesus parables scream Jewish often. I found the rabbis methods of parables easier to understand due to my background. I was used to having to tease out the meaning.The rabbi and talmidim relationship Jesus has with the disciples.Also how the writers quoted a pasuk and then divulged upon it connecting it to something quite different than its contextual meaning at least is similar to Midrash in terms of literary genre. I dont know if I would go all out and say it was such an attempt at Midrash but it looks like simply a related genre that utilized similar structure. ,Judaism,dbx74da,1,t5_2qi67

You can check the Wiki on minhag to read  about how the Rambams father wrote that communities with the minhag to eat sphinge on Chanukkah shouldnt stop. Eating sphinge was neither instituted by the Sanhedrin nor is it a fulfillment of a mitzvah.There is also a phrase in the Yerushalmi minhag mevatel halachah.

10407491,0,t1_dcno4bt,gtTo Conservatives hes not ego driven at all. Im a conservative who voted for Trump while holding his nose and I think it is glaringly obvious that he is very ego driven.Of course so are Obama and the Clintons to at least as much a degree if not more so.The truth is that most people are ego driven and this is doubly so for politicians so this is mostly a pointless discussion. gtThe whole he could change any moment is a stupid argument for us. You could say that about anyone. That is certainly true. But there are things that can make it easier to predict the likelihood that this will happen.In the case of Trump his pattern of behavior and statements regarding Jews in Israel make it extremely unlikely that he will suddenly move significantly in a different direction. The mere fact that he has already established a positive personal connection Prime Minister Netanyahu makes this unlikely. Precisely because Trump is driven largely by a desire for approval means that he is likely to value personal connections over the supposed pragmatism of realpolitik.,Judaism,dcnr9bh,4,t5_2qi67

Turkey has a history of being a laicistic country where religion was strictly a private issue but Erdogan and pretty much everyone in his administration is deeply religious.The Arab community on the other hand has grown a lot lately. The internet can be blamed as well. I have a coworker. Shes about  her parents are Turkish she used to be a liberal Muslim. We were friends on Facebook and about half her postings were Turkish half were German. At one point I realized she pretty much stopped writing in German. Most of what she did write included Allah Alhamdulillah whatnot. And finally she had that huge portrait of Hitler on her page with a proverb underneath. I did a quick Google translate and realized it was a saying falsely related to Hitler but one thats noticeably disgusting even for Hitlers standards which means a lot.

10631395,0,t1_ddcii6n,You think that. And I think that. But Orthodox Jews dont. Orthodox Jews dont consider Conservative or Reform Judaism to be appropriate Jewish practice. Theres a reason why a Conservative conversion doesnt count as conversion in Orthodox communities. Those reasons matter. Someone who converts to Orthodox Judaism should do it because in their heart and soul they know it to be true. If OP does then he should not convert into another branch of Judaism because of what that truth entails. If he has any doubts any questions or wants to explore every branch of Judaism before coming to a decision that would be a very good thing. But if he knows what his soul needs...then he knows.These oaths that we take when we convert mean something. It is about more than just a person and Hashem. It is a threeway covenant the convert Hashem...and the Jewish people specifically the people you cast your lot with in that moment of time. Your rabbi your beit din your community the Jewish people as a whole... They matter!Even if time and circumstances change your future you need to mean it in that moment. A conversation is invalid if the convert goes into it knowing they have no intention of following through.

10680286,0,t3_5srnbs,I grew up in an observant Conservative Household. My Shul had  families thousands of people and as my dad likes to use as a metric the amount of people that fast on Tzom Gedalia from Shul can be counted on two hands.Our Shul in theology was a very right wing Conservative Shul. The people aside from the Rabbis chazzan and one other family were not.There was a decent amount of knowledge especially amongst the older regulars but it never translated to much practice.My parents sent us to an Orthodox School not MO then an MO high school  though we were staunchly egalitarian. We were pretty much what The USCJ wished CJ looked like.But then our Shul started losing people and that opened up a new realization for us. The movement had been adopting practices that didnt seem to even remotely mesh with anything Halachic from our perspectivethings were changing to keep butts in seats.Last Purim I actually went back and they were encouraging people to drink...BEFORE THE MEGILLAH READING. TAANIS ESTHER meant NOTHING.Once our Shuls membership started dwindling it started adapting some of these new rulings.This didnt jive well with me or my family. My dad was the lead Gabbai ran a consistent minyan and since it wasnt gaining people or losing people the Shul lost interest in keeping the actual people for whom Judaism was relevant in their everyday lives.My dad now goes to a Hashkama minyan at a nearby MO shul though he still holds strongly to egalitarian beliefs. It doesnt effect his davening so he isnt bat up over it but it did when my sister was growing up!I just think the Movement is sacrificing its principles to get people which implies Halacha has no basis in it which means its no different than Reform Judaism. I have no quarrel with RJ. I disagree with it but at least theyre honest about what they believe and practice CJ isnt honest.So no longer do I associate with a movement that I believe doesnt know what it wants.

I still felt the need for religion but felt the well of Christianity to be poisoned and I have always loved all things Jewish so I converted to Judaism. It ultimately wasnt for me and I missed Christianity. I was able to come back to it and got baptized in the Anglican church where I am fully accepted for being gay just like I was in the conservative synagogue. I regret my conversion because it wasnt really fair to Judaism. I feel like I didnt convert for the right reasons hence the question. By the way you sound like me with sexual ethics. I dont have sex either. Not because Im opposed to it in all circumstances. But I dont want to be with someone until its sure. And dating in the gay world is hard enough already but especially so if you have a more conservative sexual ethic. Anyway I wish you all the best. Please dont see this comment as me trying to discourage your conversion. ,Judaism,deqaq89,1,t5_2qi67

The only times she mentions Zionism she is clear to say rightwing Zionism. I think Zionism and Feminism are perfectly compatible but I also think Shires article was a pile of trash.

11244585,0,t3_601p1e,He speaks well and makes a good case that Classical Reform Judaism does not mean free for all and that it entails certain obligations. Its quite a good history lesson too and refreshingly frank as well.However he fails to support his thesis. Reform Judaism may be Jewish Action heavy but traditional Judaism is also Jewish Action heavy firstly in the sense that it requires what Reform Judaism calls Ceremonial or Ritualistic Jewish action in day to day life but also because it demands Jewish Action in mostly the sense that he means here  doing acts of kindness standing up for the oppressed etc.Obviously traditional Judaism doesnt extend these principles to things which are explicitly forbidden by Jewish law and needless to say traditional Jews arent always perfect in this often because it would be selfendangering but the principles are certainly there. If Classical Reform had invented the ethical principles of Judaism it wouldnt be Judaism at all! It found them in Jewish tradition.So in sum Reform Judaism is the same as traditional Judaism just with fewer obligations except that some things which are forbidden or discouraged by tradition become obligatory. Thats pretty much light by definition  kind of the same just less.And hes speaking mostly about Classical Reform which isnt quite the same as contemporary Reform although hes arguing that contemporary Reform should go back to its roots which is fair.,Judaism,df6k2aq,1,t5_2qi67

Joseph Telushkins Jewish Literacy is good for very beginners covering Jewish practice beliefs and even a decent section on Jewish history. Probably not necessary for students who have been studying JUdaism for awhile though.Siddur It should match the one used at your shul. Most beginners are half memorizing the prayers based on what they hear half slowly painfully reading it. The process will go much faster if you are familiar with the visual clues and English content from home practice so at least newbies can be on the right page. Bible JPS is better for beginners even though its dreaded historical criticism is often not Orthodoxapproved. The problem with Artscroll is that it can be difficult to parse for to newcomers to Judaism. Both are good to have for comparison purposes especially for people coming from secular backgrounds.Benscher This is one of those items that Jews from birth take for granted but is really useful for potential converts to acquire. The NCSY ones are ubiquitous but also use the Ashkenazi transliteration which may or may not be maddening depending on what summer camps the people around you went to. Speaking of benching Shabbat for Starters is still the best CD Ive ever found for learning Shabbat blessings and zmirot. They do birkat hamazon a lot slower than most people do in real life making it easier to follow along from your benscher while practicing. Also although all the voices on the CD are male its a capella covering a wide range of harmonies so everyone can follow along. The booklet that comes with the physical CD is also nice with large clear Hebrew font and an interlinear transliteration.You also might want to look into online audio links for common prayers. Its been awhile since I converted so I dont know what is currently out there but surely this is a thing.Learning modern Hebrew Youd think with all the ulpanim in Israel thered be better materials available for teaching adults but no. Back in the day I used Ora Bands workbooks and they were adequate. Other good references are Modern Hebrew An Essential Grammar Barrons  Hebrew Verbs which is conveniently organized by shoresh and the LaudenWeinbach Bilingual Dictionary This dictionary is somewhat rare in the U.S hence the amazon price but is GREAT once youve learned a little Hebrew.

11673599,0,t1_dgj5x68,Well its hard to say Shabbos is necessarily more important  what does that even mean? But it is the basis for the major Jewish festivals which are often described in relation to it.  For example the Torah calls Yom Kippur Shabbos Shabbason The Sabbath of Sabbaths. Typically for Shabbos there is a short prayer service at sunset women generally stay home and light the Shabbos candles then when everyones home there are some songs sung around the dinner table and Kiddush sanctification is recited then the meal begins often with challah.  There are traditional foods like Geftile fish chicken soup potato kugel and roasted chicken is popular but you can really eat anything.  Eating the same thing every week gets boring obviously. Sometimes on Friday night there are gatherings called oneg with snacks singing learning Torah or just hanging out. In the morning theres the prayer service lasts  to  hours depending on how fast your synagogue goes or if theres more or less to do that week or an event like a bar mitzvah.  Every week theres a different portion of the Torah read called the parsha.  After the service theres usually food called Kiddush same word as previously used.  Then people go to lunch which is often big.  A traditional food to eat for Shabbos lunch is Cholent Ashkenazi or Chamin Sephardi or other variations which are stews that were cooked overnight.  Since you cant cook on Shabbos they are started on Friday and left to cook until lunchtime. After lunch people are usually stuffed they nap or go on walks in nice weather or learn Torah or whatever and the kids do kid stuff. Later there is the afternoon prayer service Jews pray  times a day then a short light meal called Shalosh Seudos or Seudat Shlishi youre supposed to have  meals a day then the evening service followed by Havdalah ceremony to end Shabbos. ,Judaism,dgj7vr7,2,t5_2qi67
