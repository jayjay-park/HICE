1536143,0,t1_cj3xwnb,  PMMan what a week. I definitely didnt get  hour of writing done a day. Yesterday I managed to do a full hour but I was pretty tired and it probably wasnt worth it.I have to admit my motivation for sticking to this whole screenwriting thing is pretty low right now. With trying to find a job and taking care of a sick girlfriend frequent trips to the Docs this week I just cant find the time or the energy to do it. Maybe thats what separates the little fish from the big fish though. Kinda wish there were other people here it gets lonely talking to myself. On to the next week. ,shutupandscreenwrite,cj8txmk,1,t5_30ktg
