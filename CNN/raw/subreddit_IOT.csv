As for content I just skimmedpartly because of the formatting and also because I dont have much to compare to dont read blogs. You should make sure you proofreadedit your submissions. Some of the wording is awkward and there are a couple mistakes here and there.For examplegt... but it will also be critical to develop ways to destroy the stored information when do dispose off a gadget or sensors that store all that personal critical data about us.reads better asgt... but it will also be critical to develop ways to destroy the stored information when you do dispose of gadgets or sensors that retain personal data.These kinds of things can help make your blog more accessible for people interested in the topic. You could even provide some related links for further indepth reading which would help IoT newcomers and veterans alike.Otherwise keep up the good work.,IOT,cqd7ykd,1,t5_2shj9

11699304,0,t3_66xbw8,I am not sure if you want an IoT intercom or just visual alerts when ringing so that your parents notice. For me it sounds like the second one. I wouldnt think too complicated. It is not the intercom that you want to connect. There are surely intercom systems with some output some relay or similar on ringing where you could connect something. As for security the most hacks are due to open ports and devices publicly available on the internet. This is a home solution so keep it in your parents network. I currently see no reason for connecting it to the internet.Controlling lights is one of the most common smart home cases. Try look for solutions there e.g. WiFi smart bulbs. The connection between intercom and lightbulb can be as simple as an raspberry pi checking a GPIO where you input the signal from the door bell and then turns on the bulbs for x seconds.Hope that gave you some ideas.,IOT,dgm4v00,1,t5_2shj9
