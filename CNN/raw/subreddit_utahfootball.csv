You cant develop an offense when you do that.Not only that but you cant develop an offense if you only keep a QB with the same OC for one year which is what youd be doing right now. Thats why play calling is conservative its troys first year in our system. I knew this thread would happen yesterday and its reactionary bullshit. Were still  in a good conference. Remember what happens when you fire  win coaches? Look at UGA LSU etc.That sounds like a great idea!  sWere utah. We dont get the same recruits as USC by virtue of not being USC. And yes Colorado has a lot of incentives we dont either. We do a pretty damn good job with what were given.   ,utahfootball,dahs9f1,2,t5_2v1s4
