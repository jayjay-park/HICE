In fact all of farming is vastly more complicated than youre making it out to be.Edit Now that Im being downvoted perhaps I should explain.  Farmers buy all those expensive things to write off part of the cost this year and depreciate it in later years because the tax rates for us are kinda high.  And since equipment manufacturers know were going to spend some amount of money on new equipment each year the markup on that stuff is insane.If you institute a flat tax at  or lower farmers wont be that mad.  We write off and depreciate all that stuff to get a tax rate that low.  Herman Cains  is insanely low compared to what most farmers pay.This is a pretty simplified example of why this is a dumb argument against a flat tax.

2042482,0,t1_ckzdt4b,Your sentiment isnt wrong but your reasoning is a little shaky.  The founders intent is actually a pretty strong argument because thats one of the major ways that we interpret legislation.  Liberals like myself use it quite often when we do stuff like explain that the nd Amendment was meant to refer to militias and muskets not AKs and a bunch of rednecks in the back of a Dodge Durango.  Its a reasonable way to figure out how to interpret a law when the text itself is insufficient.Judicial Review is a separate matter arising out of Marbury v. Madison.  This gave the supreme court the ability to review legislation ratified by the legislature for its constitutionality.  The reason this is problematic for your argument is that one could be a very conservative judge like Scalia and reject a law on a textual basis or one could be a very liberal judge like Ginsburg and reject it based on the spirit and evolution of jurisprudence.Therefore rejecting the Affordable Care Act while still stupid for other reasons is hypocritical simply on the grounds of judicial review coming into conflict with textualism.Source Am law student,Liberal,ckzg0u6,6,t5_2qxt5

I also explained why its irrelevant.gtIt doesnt magically change genetics.Your genetics arent whats special about you. The fact that you can think feel and have a will of your own is whats special. A fetus doesnt have that.gt It still wont change what they are.What they are is an undeveloped person. In other words they are not a person. They have to develop into one first. Until they do they arent special because they cant think feel or have a will of their own.gt Again you tell someone that is lucky enough to have their  week old child live that they arent a fucking person because they are premature. See what happens.They might act irrationally like you are. On they other hand if theyre scientifically literate they might understand that their  week old fetus is still incapable of conscious activity that its brain literally doesnt function yet and that it still has time to develop before it can.gtIts not obvious that you have because you think that babies havent been saved at  weeks.Youre wrong. At no point did I indicate that I thought that. I said it was irrelevant if they had been saved at  weeks.gtI didnt think you were a woman so like prochoice people like to say you shouldnt have an opinion on the subject.If someone says that theyre wrong although Ive never heard anyone on the prochoice side say that. More likely youre misunderstanding or misrepresenting the argument that a man shouldnt tell a woman what to do with her own body in other words that he shouldnt prevent her from making the choice for herself and Im not. Im saying that she should make that choice and that theres no reason she shouldnt be free to. My position is not that a woman must have an abortion. Its that theres no reason that she shouldnt if she chooses.That said this isnt a matter of opinion. Its a fact that the brain of a fetus is not developed enough for conscious thought before sometime around  weeks.gtSo yeah Im an expert. No Im sorry but all of this is irrelevant and it doesnt change the fact that the brain of a fetus does not function and isnt capable of conscious activity until sometime around  weeks. It also doesnt really affect your capacity to understand that very simple scientifically verifiable fact nor would anyone else need your experience to understand it nor is this something we appear to disagree on. Once again this is simply irrelevant.gt What does it matter if something can feel pain?Because something has to be able to experience pain for pain to be inflicted upon it and whether or not we inflict pain or cause suffering is the basis by which most rational people determine the best course of action. If theres no harm theres no foul.gt Abortion is killing undeveloped human babies.Semantics aside this is correct. They are undeveloped. Killing developed humans is wrong because being developed they are capable of experiencing suffering having conscious thought having a will of their own and are therefore persons. Killing undeveloped humans isnt because they havent yet developed the capacity to experience suffering having conscious thought or a will of their own and they arent persons.gtWhat if in  years the technology comes out that those babies could feel every bit of pain and had their own different type of consciousness?Then Ill change my position but as of now theres no evidence and therefore no reason to believe that. Its quite simply your fantasy.We determine the best course of actions based on what we have good reason to believe is true not on what we fear could be true for no reason at all.This question is equally as compelling as the supposition that we shouldnt sit in a chair because in  years we might have the technology to discover that theres an invisible person already sitting in it. In other words its ridiculous.gt If they cant feel pain or have no consciousness how are they doing that?Possibly reflexes. Possibly the video you saw was of a fetus past the th week of gestation. Who knows? What we do know is that a fetus can not experience pain before  weeks because its brain simply isnt developed enough.p. VIII  In reviewing the neuroanatomical and physiological evidence in the fetus it was apparent thatconnections from the periphery to the cortex are not intact before  weeks of gestation andas most neuroscientists believe that the cortex is necessary for pain perception it can beconcluded that the fetus cannot experience pain in any sense prior to this gestation.Consciousness is a more complex question but our best guess is that it begins sometime around  weeks Before that time a fetus isnt capable of experiencing anything whether it can react to physical stimuli or not.I thought you were an expert... why arent you aware of even these basic facts?gt ...because its irrelevant when in a few weeks if you dont murder them they will be babies that not even you can deny.In a few weeks theyll be conscious and capable of experiencing pain which is what makes it wrong to kill them. Before then they arent conscious or capable of experiencing pain.gt It shouldnt be a choice any more than killing your  month old baby is a choice or killing your  year old child is a choice. And  month old and an  year old are conscious and capable of feeling pain. The  year old at least has a will of its own. Thats why its wrong to kill them. A fetus is not conscious or capable of feeling pain nor does it have a will of its own.gtWhen really its a fucking developing human folks.Thats right. An undeveloped person.

Hes going to introduce a wallstreet speculation tax to pay for college. Hes going to expand medicare medicaid and social security introduce a single payer system and invest a trillion dollars in infrastructure jobs.I dont know exactly what the numbers are but economists like the one Hillary referenced in order to criticize the tax hike agree that a single payer healthcare system will cost us less than private insurance premiums that subsidized education will cost us less than private lending companies that creating jobs means people can continue to buy things and therefore manufacturers can continue to pay their workers.So what exactly do you need regarding a tax plan?

I believe so much of this election is simply about the American people trying to send a message to the power structure that weve had it. Our leaders have failed us for decades and I believe we are all seeing just how rigged everything truly is. Enter Bernie Sanders. So much of his support  seems to come from people believing hes getting screwed by the power structure. And a ton of his support also comes from him challenging the economic power structure as well. I truly believe that Sanders and Trump supporters are actually angry at most of the same things. We have a govt and economy that is not working for us anymore. In their own ways Bernie and Trump are calling out these things. I guess my overall point is if youre wondering where this right wing populism is coming from its more about anger at our leaders and less about policy.

Liberals and socialists have been wondering for a hundred years why people in economic distress do not vote according to their economic interests. The answer should have been obvious long ago People in adversity turn not to economics but to culture. They are fortified not by policy but by identity. They seek saviors not programs. And as the direness of their circumstances appears to imperil their identity they affirm it by asserting it ferociously against others. Hurt people hurt people. Against these hurt people therefore and against the profiteer of pain who shabbily champions them it must be insisted that no amount of sympathy for their plight justifies the introduction of a version of fascism into American life.

Those you mentioned can also buy insurance on state or federal insurance exchanges.Im really not arguing against anything you posted.  Id just like to add that higher health care costs exist in lowincome populations due to health disparities with respect to obesity diabetes etc.  My original point still stands though.

There wouldnt be a Pledge of Allegiance said in schools no one would sing the Star Spangled Banner before any sporting event and no one would celebrate the th of July. Gas would cost  a gallon. Liberals would consider this a plus because it would cause more people to get tax credits to buy government subsidized  electric cars. Seven year olds would be able to vote. Free candy and endorsements from cartoon characters would become a staple of campaigning. The corporate tax rate would be  percent higher most American workers would be unionized and tax rates would soar. As a result our economy would be stagnant and our unemployment rate would permanently be in the  range. Prison sentences would be short crime would be rampant and the police would be so undermanned and tied down with regulations that they wouldnt even bother to lock people up for committing crimes like burglary..CARTOONS | STEVE BREENVIEW CARTOON  There would be price controls on electricity gasoline and most household goods. Of course there would also be regular shortages of electricity gasoline and most household goods. Children would be taught to be androgynous genderconfused weirdos in school rather than risk exposing them to gender stereotypes. Conservatism would be considered hate speech that could draw a massive fine or even jail time for repeat offenders. The good news is that housing would be free. The bad news is that it would mostly be in ugly cement buildings with drug addicts former homeless people the severely mentally ill and career criminals peppered all through the complex for the sake of diversity. Wearing a cross mentioning the Bible or advocating Christian beliefs anywhere outside of a church would be illegal because it might offend people. Meat  ounce sodas and trans fats would be illegal. Crack meth and heroin would be legal. Americas military would be so weak wed have to rely on Mexico and Canada to defend us from potential threats. The Israelis would be driven into the sea Taiwan would be swallowed by China and Russia would begin to gobble up the countries that broke free after the Soviet Union fell. Not only would partial birth abortions be legal but a mother would be allowed to kill her child for three months after hes born without penalty. Stopping sex offenders from teaching school or adopting children would be considered discriminatory. Activists would be able to sue on behalf of individual plants and animals in court. The government would control health care toptobottom. It would take six months to get an operation which would be considered a feature not a bug because a lot of old people would die in the interim and save the government money. Only government employees would be able to legally own guns. Income inequality would be nearly eradicated after all the rich Americans and big corporations fled the country rather than pay confiscatory tax rates. WalMart would only be allowed to hire union employees and completely coincidentally their prices would double. Wed have open borders and so many illegal aliens in the southern United States that California Arizona New Mexico and Texas would end up being ceded back to Mexico. There would be a free inhouse abortion clinic in every junior high in America. President Kucinichs new idea to help deal with the soaring jobless rate? Paying workers the new minimum wage  a year to dig holes and fill them back up.
