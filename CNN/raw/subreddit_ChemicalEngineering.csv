362901,0,t1_cfiamxp,I think all engineering programs share a lot of traits of the hell I wrote of. Ive only studied a year of Computer Science and three of Chem E so have a limited perspective Ch E does have a reputation of being harder than most other engineering programs. uiamcarlgauss nailed it. Youll know by the time you finish your stoichiometry course some programs call it mass and energy balances if chem e is something you want to do or drop like a bad habit. We do enjoy it in a masochistic kind of way. I told my advisor that I want it hard. And thats true. I live for a challengeif its easy then I get bored and then I get myself into troublebecause trouble is hard even if unproductive. A solid understanding of chemistry IS important in chem e. In my last internship I frequently overheard the conversations between the lead process  engineer whom I worked with and the research chemists that also worked onsite or in an affiliated university. Methyl group unbinds then... The kinetics of the X reaction are favorable ... Dehydrogenation... Free radical conversion and deposition onto the ... I cant elaborate signed a NDA but you get the idea. But chemistry isnt what we do. We do physics that smells like chemistry. Strange analogy but its the best I can come up with. There are opportunities at a graduate level to be more involved in the more chemistry side of the field. But most Chem E graduate programs really want Chem E undergradsand if they take in someone who isnt theyre going to have them take several of the undergrad coursework anyway. I know a guy in this situation nowhes undergrad chemistry graduate chem e but in the junior level thermo heat mass etc with the rest of us. Hell go through a good portion of the senior year curriculum too. Biological applications are also going to have a stronger emphasis on chemistryone must understand the chemistry of biological processes occurring at a cellular level to design bioprocesses. Enzyme catalysis protein unfolding etcIt sounds to me however that engineering isnt really what you want. You seem to prefer the pure science aspect. Which is totally fine we love and need science. But engineers generally are more interested in the practical applications of what we learn through science than science for sciences sake. There arent many employment opportunities for pure science at an undergraduate level however. A former roommate of mine graduated BS Chemistry solid GPA from a prestigious U. Went back to school for Ph.D because he was tired of being a way overqualified dishwasher  he worked in a lab cleaning lab glassware. My mother studied pureabstract mathematics in undergrad she always encouraged me to go into an applied sciencemath field. She was gainfully employed in academia and loved what she did but Ill earn more in my first year out of BSChE than she ever did in the peak of her career even after adjusting for inflation.TLDR. Sorry this is so long winded. ChE does use chemistry but is more about macroscopic applications how to make  kg Of X per hour efficiently than molecular details. You need to decide what you really want from your education before you get too far into it. Any flavor of engineering will open many career options. Any flavor of science is going to all but require grad school for decent employability. ,ChemicalEngineering,cfidpds,2,t5_2qwn7

If you think you would be interested in those jobs then I recommend you research them heavily. If you are pretty sure that is what you really want then yeah get a PhD. If you arent sure Id recommend against it.Also from a purely financial point of view a BSc is definitely better than a PhD even over the long term. You just wont make up for the decreased salary in your early twenties.On the other hand an MS is a smart thing to do while youre looking for a job. It will make you more employable youll gain skills youll make valuable contacts and the time commitment is reasonable. Opinions vary on whether a thesis or nonthesis option is better.

861268,0,t3_23xkav,Question OverviewBecome familiar with how to do simple operators like gradient divergence laplacian etc. all the del operators. Theyre used throughout the entire book. Although theyre all tabulated in the back so I wouldnt fret too much. BSL thats what most people call the text is an excellent book. Its the transport book. However one thing about it is that after a few chapters the derivations get intense and they leave out steps expecting you to look at it and be like oh I could see how you get there but not actually do it. The thing is it might be in your best interest to fill in the missing steps. This depends on the problem some are just too frustrating but I would create an addendum to the text that fills in the steps. This helps you study truly understand the material and will be a helpful reference tool. Chapter SuggestionsIf you are convinced on preparing over the summer I recommend reading based on nd editionSection .  Take note of Newtons Law of Viscosity and Appendix B.Section .  Learn how to set up a shell momentum balanceSection .  This is the first time you use a shell momentum balance so its a great problem falling filmIf youre feeling adventurousSection .  This takes you to shell momentum balance in cylindrical coordinatesSection .  The continuity equation and Appendix B.The NavierStokes equation and Appendix B.Question There really is no text like BSL. If the class is taught from a theoretical perspective youre best bet is to crunch through BSL. I wouldnt fret too much about preparing beforehand. BSL will teach you many of the techniques you need and the aid of a professorpeers will certainly be helpful.Not to plug my own stuff but Ive tried to outline important facets of fluid mechanics in BSL on my website Feel free to take a look when youre reading through BSL. ,ChemicalEngineering,ch26jjz,5,t5_2qwn7

The problem with machine learning models are they tend to have a hard time predicting things that they have not seen before whereas first principles models can give you some hints when you encounter novel problems or are trying to design a new process.While not quite big data a lot of control schemes will use neural networks or similar techniques to infer measurements that are not readily available or otherwise augment their behavior.I would suggest looking into singular value decomposition in general the concept of orthogonal decomposition is really useful here and feedforward neural networks.

Im not sure what stage of your undergraduate career youre at but ChemE and chemistry have vastly different undergraduate curricula. If you got accepted to a ChemE grad program youd have to do quite a bit of catchup work. I just applied to ChemE grad programs and on all my visiting weekends I only knew  person that just did chemistry in undergrad a few people did things like a double major in general engineering and chemistry. So its not impossible by any means but youll be competing with people that have a better background than you especially at highlyranked institutions if thats something youre looking at. Im not sure if youre looking at a masters or a PhD but if its a masters it may mean you take longer than the average student to catch up on classes such as engineering thermo fluid dynamics heatmass transfer and process principles.As for job prospects ChemEs seem to have better job prospects at the BS level but I dont necessarily think a ChemE PhD is by and far better off than a chemistry PhD assuming youre interested in a PhD.

Your prices all need to be calculated in similar terms bbl. bbl is breakeven in a refinery and anything above  is really good. I havent checked in a while but my guess is it just around . Use Bloomberg.comenergy to get these prices. They mix units so you will need to convert  galbbl Also many oil companies are vertically Integrated meaning they have business in upstream which means the company as a whole is hurting so it doesnt matter that the refinery is doing well.

6591705,0,t3_45fgug,Im currently a junior ChemE and Ive gotta say... you need a solid understanding of differential equations and how calculus relates to real life scenarios.Granted you can survive and get your degree without being great at math Ive known a few people who have and theyre doing good in industry but itll be pretty difficult. Where Im at right now in my coursework Im taking  specific classes that are incredibly heavy on diff eq and they are the most useful classes to the major Ive taken so far. One is ChemE Thermodynamics which relies on using multivariable calculus calc  essentially just calculus in  dimensions instead of  and differential equations to understand and analyze energy changes in systems and reaction equilibria. The other is called transport phenomena and is about the transport of mass and energy specifically heat. The entirety of that class is based on understanding differential equations being able to read differential equations and translate them to real life scenarios being able to turn real life scenarios into differential equations and solve them understanding the physical meaning behind your solution and using pretty complex differential equations to derive solutions. It is also incredibly heavy on multivariable calculus.I am not trying to put you down however or say that you cant do it or arent smart enough. I got a C in college algebra in high school didnt take chemistry til college and first semester took precalc and prechem and I am doing pretty great in the classes Ive described above. I killed calculus chem and physics prereqs because I spent hours each day studying for them. Its hard work but if youre passionate about it itll be really fun!

I started with a guy that graduated with his masters at  top  chemical engineering school. We made the same pay we had the same responsibilities and I outperformed him where after  months my salary trumped his by a decent amount. It all depends on the person. School names are just a pissing contest.You can be like another old coworker who also graduated in a top  engineering school. She Always brought it up constantly because she thought she was a better engineer since she went there. Well shes k in debt and once again did not help her salary or responsibilities. Also being a good engineer is to make responsible financial decisions. I would argue she was a pretty bad one for making that choice.Stick with the state school.

6833263,0,t1_d0qrih3,There is another reason why industry has a slight disdain for ChemEs with GPA gt. IMO a bigger reason. They make the assumption that they are not well rounded individuals. Because chemE is largely a manufacturing profession the most important skill to have is the ability to work well in a team they already know you have the technical skills if you are graduating with a cheme degree. You will be interacting with everyone from the plant manager and other executives to operators on a daily basis the best chemes can relate and effectively communicate to both. I had  internships during college and got job offers from  of the companies at the beginning of the school year. My GPA was in the meaty maybe leading part of the bell curve. I didnt even apply for other positions because one of the job offers was a position they typically only offered to people with greater than  years of experience. What Im saying is go out and party on occasion have friends outside of cheme. Do your best to keep your grades up that is still very important.

This not only solidifies your position in the company as a hard worker this also solidifies in your industry that you will get things done. The buck stops with you.

Be the guy who will show up get it done day   day  for atleast the first  years. Consider yourself very fortunate that you have a job especially when the market is absolute shit.

As long as the pay post graduation will be competitive I would say it is a no brainer. Getting paid to get the degree and guaranteed a job that will give you  years of specialty chemicals experience?

8117608,0,t1_d4rsggp,gtI would apply for an MS program at your state college since you are going to have to pay for it and that is the cheapest option and then apply to PhD programs everywhere elseThat was what I was planning to apply to the MS programs at a few places and applying to my top choice PhD programs just in case they decide that my research experience is good enough to overcome my GPA. After the MS Ill apply to both the top choices and the safety ones because I would be out of options by that point.gtAnother option is working for a few years and taking  or  grad level courses as you have time to show you can handle the coursework.I already took one and did well but I dont think that a couple of courses is enough.gtyour eventual advisor primarily cares about your ability to do good research. Getting an A in a few courses doesnt say much about your ability to do that writing a thesis does.Its true that PhD is about doing research and I was thinking that I had already proven myself in it. However I would still need to pass the courses first. In addition other PhD program threads in this sub and others agree that GPA is important in getting in.In addition another reason for considering the courseworkonly route is that no MS programs seem to offer tuition and stipend and Im trying to save money.

People honestly have a connotation that chemical engineers cant do anything unrelated to chemical. Whereas employers tend to look more favourably on mechanical electrical etc. engineers just due to the name. Its definitely not the case everywhere but many employers Ive met at career fairs just dont like chemical engineers. Usually I have to say that Ive worked in industrial environments before and other things like I enjoy programming etc. A lot of employers hiring coop students at least those who hire from Waterloo usually try to take advantage of the financial incentives they get a rebate?. I have friends hear from companies that theyd rather hire coop students each semester than hire a fulltime employee. At many places Ive worked procedures developed by coop students end up becoming broken telephone games...But yes without connections its really not good especially with the oilgas industry.

9373883,0,t1_d93oydp,gtI believe most of the comments show that the chem eng world is filled with going to stock up on some cash and getting the hell out.Yeah I think the reason for this is that theres a huge difference between what college professors say that industry is going to be like versus the realities of the jobs that  of graduates will be doing upon graduation. The reality is that working for most companies isnt anywhere near as intellectually stimulating as the academic work is. Youre given these problem sets and told theyll be like the problems youll have to solve in industry  now I see that might have been the way it was  years ago when these professors were in the industry. From talking to my classmates in a lot of cases you just dont have the freedom to truly be an engineer because it has been taken away from you by strict regulations advancing technology braindead coworkers or office politics.I believe that most people are very unfulfilled in their jobs but are trapped there due to the lifestyle that theyve created and the mountains of debt theyve built up mortgage car student loans credit cards etc. Were told that we should get good grades so we can get into a good college so we can get a good job.

The only way to obtain a superheated liquid a liquid above its saturation temperature and below its critical temperature is to increase the pressure which increases the boiling point. Off the top of my head the saturation condition for methanol at C has a vapor pressure of  psi but Id confirm that. As for evaporation it is always occurring. Recall the definition of vapour pressure and its behavior. It can be thought of the quantity of fluid in the vapour phase directly above the gas liquid phase surface and note  that even at temperatures below saturation there exists a vapour pressure.

Ultimately they benefit from you getting placed somewhere with good pay and they benefit if that turns in to a long term position for you so they have a lot of incentive to find a good fit.  Typically theyll be temp positions but its a good foot in the door and maybe could help you rule out something you definitely dont want to do.Grad school is alright but I dont think its the right move to pay for your own masters or to get a PhD just because youre not sure what else to do.  Ultimately the PhD qualifies you for much different kinds of work than a BS and it might not be what youre looking for.My involvement for hiring hasnt really been on a technical level and has always been after the initial HR and hiring manager screening.  Theres usually at least one person there thats just there to answer the question would you want to work with him or her?  Do you think theyd fit in with the safety culture the worklife balance etc?.  So if you can work in some personal stuff tell us a little about yourself.  There will be plenty of people there to quiz your technical knowledge but dont forget to let people know that you think company xyz is a good fit for YOU not just the other way around.To give you the behind the scenes look typically the hiring manager will pull in a few other people for various roles including HR technical leads someone for culture fit like I mentioned above etc.  He or she will pass out your resume well review and get a scheduled time to meet with you.  Hopefully they will send out a description of what position exactly theyre hiring for and what exactly it is theyre looking for in a candidate.  Once the day of interviews has been completed there will be a debrief meeting where we all go around in a circle and discuss our impressions pros cons and ultimately a yesno on if we think we should extend an offer.  The hiring manager usually goes last and lets everyone know based on our feedback what they think theyll decide.,ChemicalEngineering,ddpbmmx,8,t5_2qwn7

10879130,0,t3_5veqhd,Getting an internship is more dependent on timing and luck than your academic standings in school. It depends heavily on when a company is recruiting for interns and if they have a need for interns during the summer. Your academic qualification will allow you to get your foot in the door for an interview but getting an offer for an interview is a whole different game. I would say this dont get too down on yourself. Your doing well and Im sure your doing all that you can with what you have. My next advice would be to target certain companies that you know your school is a feeder for. Going to career fairs is one way of doing this. Remember to also touch up your resume and make your that its up to par with what it has to be. ,ChemicalEngineering,de23sa9,1,t5_2qwn7

How would you say the pay compares to other paths Chemical Engineers can take? Are you happy doing what you do satisfied with your work? What kind of interests brought you to where you are now? What do you have planned for the future of your career?Answer as many of the questions as you would like I appreciate it! ,ChemicalEngineering,de8o3r3,1,t5_2qwn7
10962863,0,t3_5wkbjt,So I am installing a bypass around this condenser. Red line is vapors blue line is liquid. Blue dash is the undesired flow that I am afraid could occur.The condenser condenses vapors from a scrubber which fall in to the tank below. A level is kept in the tank. The liquid is volatile so the pipe on the left red line manages these vapors. The condenser and tank are kept at the same pressure because of this equalization line. I am worried that since I am bypassing the condenser there could be potential for the liquid to flow to the condenser. Physically the line will be closer to the condenser which is ft above the tank. The pipe on the right blue line is not straight between the two tanks so there will be more piping loss from the inlet to the tank vs. inlet to the condenser above. This has led me to think the liquid will flow up to the condenser. However that just doesnt make sense because they are at the same pressure. I would imagine to flow up to the condenser the pressure would have to be less than the tank below at least by the head pressure of a column of liquid ft.I apologize for this stupid question and I would really appreciate some help understanding a simple concept. I can clarify anything to help get a grasp on whether I need to be concerned about flow in to the condenser or if it will all go to the tank below.And sorry for the crappy Paint drawing...,ChemicalEngineering,deaqq3j,2,t5_2qwn7

11053863,0,t3_5xuh3v,Likely this number is referring to how pinched the cooling curves are. You need a certain delta T to drive heat exchanger right?Example below is for a counter current heat exchangerLets say you have process air fluid A that needs to be heated. And you have hot air fluid B that you are using to heat it up.efficiency  inlet temperature of fluid A  outlet temperature of fluid Ainlet temperature of fluid A  inlet fluid temperature of fluid BIf efficiency    then you can rearrange the algebra in that top equation to become outlet temp of fluid A  inlet temp of fluid B which is fully pinched condition at one end of the exchangerA really really efficient exchanger needs to be massive with large residence time for the process fluids.,ChemicalEngineering,dekxq9l,2,t5_2qwn7
