53884,0,t1_cekj9wa,The point is that the movement was religious. It is an absurd claim that he wanted to turn back the country to the times of the Sassanian considering how Sassanians massacred the Mazdakis and Khurrami religion was an offshoot of Mazdakism mixed with Islam. He may have had used nationalistic feelings but if nationalism was his main intention why did he chose such a controversial religion that was heretical to Zoroastrians too? Also the claim that he was against Islam is questionable too since Khurramis believed in Muhammad. It is more likely that the nationalists claimed Babak to be one of their own even though his movement was mainly a cultish religion. Babak was discovered in the time of Reza Shah and falsely promoted by the ultranationalists as a national hero and it makes claims of his nationalism more dubious. ,iran,cekkc8d,1,t5_2qhzq

120670,0,t3_1vgdq7,I wrote a long post a while back about how Irans political system works. Id recommend reading it here There are a lot of different views among Iranians my interpretation is not universal but I think it will be useful.It would take a book to answer your questions completely. Ill write some basic stuff and ask me any questions you have. Realize these are my views only not every Iranians.Iranians as a whole are hyper nationalist and have a strong feeling that they have been unfairly dealed with in the past  years. You will clearly see this if you hang around on this page for a little. Throughout the past  years every political group regardless of ideology has tried to appeal to two things  Religion and  Nationalism. In action people have shown they will often support groups they disagree with on almost every issue except nationalism if they act or pretend to act on nationalist causes.As far as the nuclear thing goes the vast majority of the public believes sees very clear double standards. Who is America to tell Iran not to have nuclear energy when they have the biggest nuclear weapon stockpile in the world and are the only people to have used it? What right does Israel have to speak when they are not part of the NPT they have nukes and they go around bombing new Arab country every  seconds? There is no doubt these double standards make the vast majority of people angry. That having been saidIn  Mr. Ahmadinejad became the president. He definitely played tough on the nuclear issue for the first  years in order to win nationalist points. This at the beginning largely worked. He got a large support base because of his hardline views on the nuclear issue across Iranians of all stripes.In  there was a dispute over whether the election was rigged or not. People were tired of Ahmadineajd they didnt care about his nuclear stuff anymore because there was increasing mismanagement inflation unemployment ect. Ahmadinejad tried to reach a deal with the US and the other candidate who alleged the elections were rigged basically accused him of selling out the country. He was in a very weak domestic position then couldnt afford this so he bailed on the deal. There have always been sanctions on Iran but we always found a way around them. However since  there were draconian sanctions imposed basically shutting Iran out of the global banking system and shutting down our oil sales. Suddenly the ordinary person clearly felt pain from these. To make things worst Ahmadinejad made major economic reforms removing government subsidies off major goods but implemented it in a poor way and the economy just spiraled out of control. Things would double in price by the day. Irans currency lost its value by  over like  months and then over course of a week lost it by another . There were shortages of essentially medical drugs in hospitals. No one starved on the streets but people clearly lost a lot of purchasing power and everyone suffered.At this point there was a growing sentiment that having nuclear energy is Irans right but we cant just fight the entire world by ourselves perhaps it would be wise to reach some sort of compromise. Come  and new elections. The former chief nuclear negotiator who made a deal with the EU ten years ago that fell apart because the Bush administration didnt sign on named Hassan Rouhani was a candidate. His famous statement was it is our peoples right to have their centrifuges spinning but it is also their right to have their lives spin.Initially it was a long shot. People were very disillusioned after what happened in  the economy just dying a super paranoid closed political atmosphere and growing corruption and international isolation. Even core regime supporters were just tired of it all. A lot of people figured voting is useless this regime has to go and the whole thing is probably rigged anyway. However as a result of the TV debates and particularly the last few weeks of campaigning things heated up Rouhani got more and more popular people started getting excited and in the end Rouhani who  months ago was a nobody won in a landslide.At this point Rouhani cannot provide any quick fixes on the economy it will take years to bring back to normal and does not have the political ability yet to fully take on hardliners and ease the cultural and political atmosphere. He needs to do something though to differentiate himself from Ahmadinejad and win political points. His best chance is through foreign policy and reaching some sort of settlement on the nuclear issue and ultimately reestablish normal relations with the West overall. He desperately needs this.As far as the media goes there is a lot of censorship in Iran. It is not like North Korea status but there are clear red lines. A lot of times websites and newspapers have to be subtle and talk indirectly. In recent months things have definitely slightly relaxed on the press freedom front not greatly but certainly a little and now there are some people openly questioning the need for certain aspects of a nuclear program and advocating making peace with the West. This has generally been unheard of in the past  years.Financially a lot of people specifically the IRGC majorly profit from sanctions. Basically they have their own mafia networks and can import stuff abroad from underground. Sanctions eliminate their competitors and give them more power. At the same time because Irans currency has devalued so much certain people exporting things are having a lot easier time selling their stuff abroad in places like Iraq Afghanistan TajikistanTurkey ect and making big profits. So there are some people that profit both economically and politically from sanctions and dont want them lifted.At the same time there are a lot of rich insider people particularly the group that Rouhani is a part of that follows former President Rafsanjani that are big on international trade and want foreign investment. They would profit from lifting sanctions and doing deals with the outside. Basically sanctions would result in a net shift in political and economic power from the IRGC people to the Rafsanjani people.Finally as far as the people go Rouhani wanted to hold a poll of people in regards to relations with the US but apparently they prevented him from publishing it. Supposedly the number were  something percent in favor of it. It is in the advantage of most people particularly the middle class for the RafsanjaniRouhani crowd to win because they the people are the ones ultimately suffering from sanctions and while all problems will not go away life will definitely get easier with better relations with the West.,iran,ces670b,8,t5_2qhzq

Iran would BOOM it would outpace China it would become incredibly rich VERY quickly and those crazy religious lunatics who we ALLOW to abuse our people our heritage our pride as HUNAN BEINGS will suddenly be in control of one of the worlds fastest growing most promising economies. And what will they do with a booming Iran? they would most likely waste in building gigantic mosques that take  years to build increase military spending but still starve us during our mandatory military service attempt to gain hegemony in the Middle East so they can spread their crazy religious beliefs and ideology to others probably try and destabilise Saudi and Israel they would increase the police state build a private Iranian intranet and cut us off from the outside world build more prisons force more sex changes and of course steal money into their own bank accounts.What we Iranians need to do is kick the Mullahs and religious fanatics out of power and send them home to bed with a good kick up their arse for good measure. These Mullahs have ruined our country and our reputation and prestige and we still let them do it. We need to install a TOTALLy secular modern parliamentary democracy. We need to realise that Israel the US and the West will NEVER trust Iran and will never let us back into the world economy with those crazy bastards in power.Iran will NEVER be allowed to improve with our current leadership and political system. We need to get off our lazy backsides and start the Second Green Revolution and this time DONT FUCKING STOP.Otherwise yes they are gonna lie about Iran.

1619119,0,t1_cjirf2b,I have never heard of the Shahnameh having an antiMuslim message. Its possible that it fell out of favor among revolutionaries because it was perceived by many as having a racist antiArab message but that was part of the Arabs ruined Iran by forcing Iranians to become Muslim myth propagated under the Pahlavi regime. When I studied in the US I often came across this phenomenon in which Iranian expat communities continue to cultivate this myth that the Shahnameh is somehow an archetypal antiIslam or antiArab work which is funny because it was written by a Muslim and doesnt predate Islam. They havent read Shahnameh otherwise theyd know that it isnt.If you actually read the Shahnameh Im sure youd find lots of proIslam statements and zero antiIslam statements. That was typical of literary works at the time and authors would introduce their works with some homage to religious personalities. Shahnameh unsurprisingly praises Muslim figures. If it hadnt it probably never would have been published in the first place or stayed in print for a thousand years which has led some to speculate that the statements are insincere but giving old Iranian Muslim works of literature an antiIslamic tint is more likely to be anachronistic bias.Generally theres no stigma against the Shahnameh among any Iranians religious or otherwise. If it went out of print in the early stages of the IRI it may have been for a number of reasons. Since the IRI itself is only a few decades old to say early stages could mean a period of anywhere from a few months to a few years. This is also the first time Ive ever heard of it being censored by the regime. One of the notable characteristics of the IRI is that it is rather open to literature for a Muslim country. Of course there are notable cases where books have been banned but Im not sure if a banned books list in Iran would be any lengthier than a list of books that have been banned in the US. Shahnameh was always regarded as valuable cultural heritage and not antiestablishment.This video recently produced by the IRI quotes the line of the Shahnameh that every Iranian has memorized Basi ranj bordam dar in sal si ajam zende kardam badin parsi and even bothers to read an English translation of it. This video also repeats the common myth that Shahnameh contains only Persian words and is pure Persian. Shahnameh is notable because the percentage of Arabic words is lower than other writings of the time I think I read somewhere that its about .As for the former USSR I can ask some people here in Tajikistan if the Shahnameh was ever censored. The Soviets basically banned anything written in the Arabic script which means that Central Asians DID have access to literary works in their own language but only if they were converted to Cyrillic script and approved for publication. There were also underground circulations but also only in Cyrillic because thats all people knew.,iran,cjj98br,3,t5_2qhzq

This is actually quite repetitious in the history of the Kurds.Several rebellions caused the Safavids to take drastic measures against the Kurdish Emirates including deportation to the Khorasan province so they would no longer be influenced by the Ottoman empire. This deportation occurred during the th to th centuries. Now there are . million Kurds in the Khorasan province and theyre quite a unique bunch with great music.Interesting to note is that after they were settled in the Khorasan province they took advantage of the Afghan invasion and sided with them during the siege of Hamadan. In their pursuit for independence the Kurds have often formed alliances with whatever enemy power that comes along. Before it was the Ottomans then the Afghans and now Israel.

He asked GharaBaghi to arrange a meeting for him with Mehdi Bazargan the human rights lawyer who became Khomeinis First Prime Minister. The General informed me of Huysers request before I left but I have no idea of what ensued. I do know that GharaBaghi used his authority to prevent military action against Khomeini.

Kind of like how US supports Israel in part because they know Israel is much less of a potential threat to US commercial interests than Iran Israel is small low population no resources and everyone in the region hates them Iran is relatively large high population resources and has some sympathy from a few neighboring countries.Third this might have been possible if the Shah was willing to take risks and let smart people lead and take charge but it seems to me he was not willing to risk the good situation he had even if it there was a potential benefit for him if things worked out.,iran,co1kmse,2,t5_2qhzq

Aurenghzeb and Tamerlane are  examples of Muslim rulers who committed some atrocities but none of this is exclusive to Islam and if anything happened less frequently by the Islamic empires than it did by other empires.No one seems to remember things like the fact that the Assyrians made mountains of skulls out of their Mesopotamian rivals or how the Normans murdered about a million people in Britain or how many people the Second Reich killed during the Scandinavian Crusades. Its a microscopic focus on Islam and its not intellectually honest. gtif only because of what the phrase is associated with. That phrase is associated with ultranationalism.

Atheist cant be considered to be good people according to the book and this man says the contrary to make me or another atheist feel somewhat of remorse or kindness toward Christianity. You cant get a job and cherry pick what you want. Puritanism is absolute. Why is Christianity slowly dying? Because as it progressed it became tolerant forgiving and welcoming to a certain extent.

Both false negatives and false positives can occur. In case of a false positive a repeat test can be requsted. Other drug tests are available but not included. The parties can arrange that between themselves if they so desire.The notary is not allowed to pass judgment on the results. The test serves to inform the parties before marriage because addiction can be a reason for requesting divorce. This is particularly important to the woman since barring inclusion of nuptial conditions equalizing divorce rights the woman has few ways to request a divorce without the mans consent.You can inquire about and discuss with your tobe husband the inclusion of nuptial conditions that equalize the parties rights.gt I always hear rumours of chastity examinations?No such tests are required by law. Its up to the parties. A GYNOB examination for intact hymen is not normal or common but is sometimes arranged by the parties request and consent.gt I find that kind of violating and a sign of mistrust!Regulation of trust in your relationship is entirely up to you.

CurtissWright Export CorpgtIn this vast external realm with its important complicated delicate and manifold problems the President alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation. He makes treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate but he alone negotiates. Into the field of negotiation the Senate cannot intrude and Congress itself is powerless to invade it. As Marshall said in his great argument of March   in the House of Representatives The President is the sole organ of the nation in its external relations and its sole representative with foreign nations.Boehners actions have been borderline treasonous. As an Iranian this is great. A clear rift has been sown between America and Israel. The majority of Americans opposed Netanyahus speech and continue their support for negotiations.

One guy was doubting that the downing of flight  even happend because the U.S. is literally democracy and our government is literally hitler trying to brainwash us with fake stories . . . Western media has a spin just like Media here has a spin. Neither side bothers to verify anything beyond what the media says. Some people who left the horrors of the aftermath of the revolution and live abroad have that negative experience  the media spin of their current countries. Let me give you an example two men were hanged in my home city Mashhad for the rape of a  year old boy. The paedopheila and rape charges were made clear. This was in . It wasnt until many years later when I was arguing with someone was a different chat forum in a different era  to be more specific somebody first brought up that they were hanged for being gay. I didnt know what case they were talking about and it took a lot of back and forth before I realized they were talking about this specific case  these people had no idea what they were talking about because they werent there. We arent the US not everything here is documented like it is in the west. Think about this In . There were about  million people who lived here. To us their memories and experiences are gone forever like tears in the rain. People on reddit tell me things that only an Iranian living here for his entire life would know are false. I share a lot with  million people and even more generally something with a few billion people who live in countries like Iran all across the world.Some people however no matter the place.

He had legitimate mental problems. Since he left the sub has improved a lot. Kind of like how rIran has changed for the better since new mods but that was even longer ago.If you arent aware of who this guy is let me just talk about his last months active on Reddit. His last post on that sub was a thread that tried to explain how the Archaemenid Empire was Median not Persian. This connects to his other posts that Medes  Kurds I think he desperately wanted the Archaemenid Empire to be Kurdish. He left rKurdistan after that thread was deleted by the other mods because this sub went nuts and he banned us all and the other rKurdistan mods unbanned us. He was an A grade retard when it came to history he tried to argue in raskhistorians with content experts that nobody won WW. Then he became communist while at the same time being fiercely proBarzani and I saw some posts in communist subs that USSR did all the work in WW and the other Allies barely contributed. He was legitimately stupid and deserved his own sub just to read his comments. I wish he came back because he was soooo funny. He came bck with a few alts and I immediately knew it was him just because he posted exactly the same crap that only he says. Random other stuff he was always totally excited over the prospect of Israel  USA bombing Iran and toppling the government. There was a Turk poster in rTurkey discussing how his cousin doing his mandatory national service and was assassinated by what was assumed to be PKK and uKurdishNationalist cheered it and basically said it was deserved.,iran,cti09po,8,t5_2qhzq

Like B P E N T and Th are all written in the same form but vary with the number of dots and the location of those dots. Its literally the easiest thing in the world. gt especially when you start including the grammarwut gt  Plus it doesnt look as bad as you say it does.Well eh yeah it looks normal on the outside and perhapse comparing it to Vietnamese which is written in the Latin script is a bit drastic. But comparing it to languages like Hindi or Farsi which look terrible in the Latin script on a different level still applies to Kurdish. Im much much much  more fluent in Latin than I am in Persian script but even for me Its much easier to read it in the sorani script than it is in the Latin. It doesnt look bad on the physical level like vietnamese does it looks bad on a different level a level only someone fluent with both scripts would understand. uMarmulak made an excellent post on this a while ago on rkurdish. gt One of the strengths of the PersoArabic script is that it has enough ambiguity to smooth over some accents  dialect differences and it makes information related to the language more readily accessible. For example salam is a common word in many Middle Eastern languages. Here we see it written in its original formgt gt gt gt Here at Latinized versions of itgt gt PersianArabic salm  gt Tajik Persian salom  gt Turkish selam  gt Azerbaijani slamgt gt As you can see one word is now fractured across different languagesdialects making it harder to recognize and compare vocabulary. Of course if you pay attention youll notice its the same word but get ready to play hokeypokey if you ever want to be a language scholar in that region.gt gt If practical I would suggest Kurdish use the PersoArabic script because I am guessing its closer to Kurdish identity and culture and its probably what most Kurdish literature has been written in. It fits in more within the region and also it would make Turks jealous.gt the word for and in Kurdish is U in Farsi its Va. In Latin they are spelled differently in PersoArabic they are spelled exactly the same. An American would reap no benifiet from reading UVa as he has no clue what the fuck U even is. But a Kurd would recognize it right off the bat as U and read it as such and understand what said sign is saying. Its one of the beauties of sharing a script with us. Words like watan and vatan that happen to be different between KurdsArabs and Persians would be read regionally to both camps and universally recognized.,iran,cv00xys,3,t5_2qhzq

Be that lone Iranian family in the western world? Do you really think they will ever see you as one of them? In all my time in America  years people always ask me and nonwhites where are you from even the ones born here they keep prodding because what they really mean what is your ethnicity. You can speak English perfectly but you will not look like them and that alone is enough for alienation.

5843354,0,t3_3v933o,Thats a highly involved question. Reddit is unlikely to provide any useful answer for obvious reasons.If you arent Iranian you wont be allowed to hold majority shares in any company registered in Iran. As an foreignregistered company however you can be contracted by Iranian companies if they demonstrate to the government a dearth in Iran of the expertise materials or equipment you offer. I dont think that scarcity exists at the moment in Iran. There are quite a few Iranian telecom infrastructure contractors. Much of their equipment is not made in Iran though so you could look into becoming an equipment supplier and provider of training. I think Chinese companies like ZTE have that part of the market cornered too after many years of European backstabbing.For legaltechnical details of equipment andor workforce accreditation you need an Iranian lawyer as well as acquaintances among Iranian engineers. The usual way to go about this is to scout an Iranian company working in the field or parallel to it and to offer them a business opportunity. They could then be your contact in Iran. You should also look into ICT trade fairs in Iran or elsewhere where there are Iranian representatives. Iran Telecom  for example was convened about two months ago.Edit wording.,iran,cxll97p,2,t5_2qhzq

I was involved in the religious community so I met many hijabwearing Iranian American girls and they were very bright and active. They had great educations and worked hard in their fields. I know several that went into medicine and medical research and there are also ones active in journalism the media and just about anything. Their aboveaverage education levels breaks a lot of the stereotypes about practicing Muslim women but this is nothing new. According to research Muslim women are the highest educated in the US after Jewish women. We also have Iranian women without religion who are excelling in life.gtcaked up tranny looking oghdei materialistic girlsI noticed this too and I dont think its unique to Iran. I think its possibly a rebound effect in some conservative cultures. Growing up I always had the same image of women from Eastern Europe. Its probably just an effect of their social environment back home.However people to choose to live I like Iranians who are proud of Iran and also accept its diversity. I met a lot of diaspora kids in the US who really just hated Iran and Iranians. They thought literally the whole country was brainwashed  Arabized and the only real Iranians were themselves diaspora kids who grew up speaking English and have fahravar tattoos.

It shows a people who love their home and are proud of its history and culture but are worried about the future.The criticisms and negative bias I observed was mainly aimed at the government of Iran.  Which is perhaps fair especially since this is a government that is unlikely to tolerate much criticism.,iran,d09skhf,3,t5_2qhzq

Since then Irans population has tripled its oil production has halved and it consumes half that at home. Nor is it less likely that Iran was producing  enriched uranium for a medical reactor  that the US gave to Iran in the first place and which initially operated on WEAPONSGRADE  enriched uranium but which the Iranian converted to use  enriched uranium fuel. In fact the Iranians repeatedly tried to buy the fuel and then resorted to making it themslelves after the US prevented Iran from buying the fuel as usual on the international marketIran repeatedly offered to cease  enrichment if only it was able to buy the fuel but again the US said no so Iran was not suppsed to make the fuel nor buy it and those  Iranian cancer patients should just go fuck themselves.As for a nuke deterrent note that about  out of  nations on the planet can already make nukes quickly if they wanted to but they dont because nukes are actually pretty useless and dont actually provide securitynor do the Iranians think so either,iran,d9osj3c,2,t5_2qhzq

10782437,0,t3_5u5bf4,When the arabs conquered what was left of Iran they left the people with an easy choice. You would either convert to islam or have your head chopped of. And kill them wherever you find them and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And AlFitnah disbelief or unrest is worse than killing... but if they desist then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease let there be no transgression except against AzZalimunthe polytheists and wrongdoers etc.So commiting to any other religion in persia in the time of the life of Ferdowsi would be considered nothing short of suicide. ,iran,dds4oq2,1,t5_2qhzq

11276320,0,t3_60subu,I mean I personally dont like him. However with that said hes still better than Khamenei and Khomeini in virtually every single way.   And I also believe the middleeast would be embroiled in far less chaos if he was not overthrown. I still think a Bakhtier or Mossadegh or Banisadr would of been better than the Shah as a head of state though. Id recommend you check out The Shah by Abbas Milani. Milani is an Iranian historian who has the unique experience of being arrested by both Shah and Khomeini. ,iran,dfa5kom,10,t5_2qhzq
11335573,0,t3_61o3we,Khosrow I of the Sassanian era is worth mentioning. While some of his success was built upon changes set in motion by his father he still went a long way in bringing reformation to the empire and it prospered under his rule.I also think that Shapur I Khosrow II and Bahram V are worth mentioning.,iran,dfgv8i0,1,t5_2qhzq
