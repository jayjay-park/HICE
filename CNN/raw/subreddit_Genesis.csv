176049,0,t1_ceyhb1r,Im not entirely sure what the fuss was over but hes said hed rather it was left off the album altogether and Phil has commented saying Tony didnt like it as well. ,Genesis,ceyhij3,1,t5_2rp5b
1950862,0,t1_ckn3bdu,Its amazing how his touch on other peoples songs give them a much better quality even if his output isnt obvious. A great example is I Know Theres Something Going On. The song was always a guilty pleasure type of song and I could never put my finger on it as to why I liked it as much as I did. When I found out that PC did the drums and very background vocals I had my answer. It also explained why Melt PG III was my favorite PG solo album.,Genesis,ckoa6p5,3,t5_2rp5b

4195114,0,t3_38wjsn,Such a versatile drummer its hard to choose.For his unparalleled ability to help hold complicated arrangements together and give noodling master musicians a solid grounding in order to create a cohesive whole try Suppers Ready.For his jazzy chops Brand X Unorthodox Behaviour a good choice as per the advent of upanurge.For his innovative sound the simple but haunting drums on Intruder are my fave with bonus Morris Pert percussion.,Genesis,cryfv0a,3,t5_2rp5b
4200999,0,t1_crz3lj7,But the least he could do is maybe have another go with Stiltskin or hell tie up the loose ends with Tony and Mike and do another album with the rest of the Genesis gang Phil and Peter included. However shifting gears Ive always thought that if Genesis were to put out another album Atlantic wouldnt want them anymore because they dont fit their brand image theyre too busy right now with Ed Sheeran and Charli XCX and the like. However I wonder if a label like Columbia or even Peters label Real World would take them in.,Genesis,crz3uor,1,t5_2rp5b

5366706,0,t3_3oinds,A few Silver Song was recorded for a Phil Collins single and possible album in the early s. Why didnt it happen? Also Id like to know more about when he became singer. I dont think it went quite the way as presented especially since Peter told the group that Phil didnt need them to succeed. ,Genesis,cvxnocw,2,t5_2rp5b
