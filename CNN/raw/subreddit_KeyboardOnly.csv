I wont even lift my hand to use the trackpad to click on the submit button. I cant Im totally blind so I cant click. I mean the screen reader Im using does have simulated click commands builtin which are also keyboard commands and there are extremely rare situations in which I do have to click if something just absolutely wont work with the simulated click commands but that only ever happens maybe once or twice a year.,KeyboardOnly,ctbg3cv,2,t5_397ap
