9739346,0,t1_dadl0nr,Haha well ill let you in on the secret. Its two shots. One with the batarang in the wall and the other without the batarang in the wall the clean plate. I animated a still image of the batarang spinning for a few frames until it makes contract with the wall. And thats when I cut the shot with the batarang in the wall. The sound design was done by really realigned friends of ours named Jordan Mills and Colton Rybus! Theyre responsible for the awesome sound design! ,Ismahawk,dadl58n,2,t5_386f2
