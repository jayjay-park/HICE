For me photos dont do his workand I suspect others in similar genres justice. Youve got to experience it in person and pay attention to the subtle effects it has on you. Then it helps to do some research afterward on what their process was to create the piece. For me the ah hah moment was realizing that every drip and dribble in the piece was intentional. Purposefully put together in order to take something that should just be paint splattered against a canvas and turn it to an emotive experience for the viewer. ,techsupportgore,cg0yjh0,2,t5_2tnbv

Lubuntu Ive always found to have really stale UI and Openbox is capable of looking pretty.

974133,0,t1_chf0bc2,gt That might be why I liked Rins route so much because oh god there were feels for days up in that no matter whether you were on the good path or not.That was a tough one to do absolutely. Definitely the most emotional one Ive played. gtYou cant go back and change the past but I think you might have had a morefun or at least more emotionally stimulating experience without the flowchart.Youre probably right about that. Which is why Im going to finish up the good hopefully on my own decisions. I do sort of regret using the flowchart but while it may have dulled the experience to some extent Id rather that than face the bad endings. You remember the scene early on when Lilly is in the classroom and Shizune asks something about the festival and you either side with Lilly or defend yourself? Every time I get to that part it pains me to choose against Lilly because I dont want her to be mad. Like you said its a game in a fictional universe with fictional characters and I dont want them to be mad at me. Maybe thats how the game plays out but I dont like the idea of making someone like me by making someone else not like me. Apparently Im easily affected that way. Who knew. So even the idea of bad endings weighs on me to the point of using a flow chart. Maybe Ill force myself to do the bad endings one day but that day is not today nor tomorrow. These showsgamesbooks are just that good at pulling out emotions. Which is weird considering KS was made by Chan.,techsupportgore,chf0nx5,1,t5_2tnbv

1155965,0,t1_chz5fox,We had a storm go through where I live last week and had a lightning strike near my house.  The way I had my network setup is My ISPs radio equipment WDSL to my router  yr old  DLink Ethernet cable to a USB adapter plugged into my iMac.  Lost internet.  Connected the radio to my MacBook and I had internet.  So I checked the USB Ethernet adapter.  When I had the radio plugged straight into the adapter the adapter would get really hot.  Its fried.  The iMac is bootcamped with Windows   bit.  There are a lot of small problems with running  bit on iMacs mainly driver issues.  The driver didnt work for the on board NIC.  Tried to update the drivers.  Tried rolling them back.  Tried uninstalling the drivers and reinstalling nothing.  When I run it on the OS X partition the NIC connected to the radio works without any issues.  Im really hard into MechWarrior Online.  Thats running on my windows partition.  So after the lightning strike I was jonesing for Stompy Robots.  The wireless connect on the Windows partition did workAlthough I prefer using a Ethernet cable.  When ever I had the radio equipment plugged into the Internet port on the back of the router the router wouldnt recognize the radio or Vice Versa.  The router probably was damaged by the lightning strike.  And I didnt have the money for a new router.  One of the times trying to get online I accidentally put the Ethernet from the radio into port  on the router instead of the internet port.  I noticed that it was recognizing the connection.  So just for the hell of it I wirelessly connected the Windows partition of my iMac to the router and I was online Stompy Robots and all.  While the static damage did take out the USB Ethernet adapter and the router.  The radio equipment was working without any trouble.  And the USB port that the adapter was connected through was working without any trouble either.  Use to be an A.S.E. certified mechanic.  Use to do a lot of emission control diagnostics.  And one thing I know for sure is that electricity can do some unpredictable stuff.  Thats my story and Im sticking to it. ,techsupportgore,chznurs,2,t5_2tnbv

We we once had a person who bought several GB SSDs to find out one was reporting as a GB Patriot drive.

So it may only cost them  to manufacture Google Glass. They still have a large bill sitting on their desk to pay down their RampD costs. gtIts in Googles best interest to replace broken Glass devicesSure and well start requesting auto makers to replace cars that people wreck because its in their best interest. Oh wait its not because its factored in their books as a loss of profit for the company. gtat the very least offer accidental damage protection warranties. I actually agree with you on this. gt right now Google is in the phase where they are trying to getkeep them in the hands of people who will evangelize the product and help make it mainstream.Theyve been evangelized for since their announcement. The product sells itself. Everyone I know wants one. gtvery few people I know would be willing to risk losing  in an accident. Yet people carry around  phones in their pockets  laptops in their backpacks credit cards with limits in the thousands and drive  cars around all day that are at a loss of risk. Im sorry but youre plain wrong. According to my insurance Im worth  yet I take risks. gtThe device will never be popular if they keep that ridiculous price and dont offer a warrantyYou mean the device that sold out within minutes of being put up for sale the first time? The device that does come with a warranty against manufacturing defects. gtEdit Looks like Googles going to see what they can do for OP which just backs up what Im saying  No OP has a friend that works at Google. That doesnt mean anything per se. I have a friend that works at Google and he cant do anything for me. He can barely talk to me about what it is hes working on.my overall point is everyone is out to see how they can take advantage of a company. How they can manipulate things in their favor. Im a part of the right now generation and this type of thing pisses me off. Bottom line Your fuck ups are your problem.

Absolutely ruined the power supply doing it. If i had a DOS disk or a Windows disk i could have fixed it but i didnt know that. I though if i treated it like a bomb in a movie i would cut the right wire to make it work again.Now Im reading the same forum as you are with the same response you are having.

Its VERY sensitive to torque and theres a big yellow sticker inside warning people about this.The way these stations operate is that theres a switch inside thats kept closed by the handle. The handle is part of the cover. See where Im going with this?Tighten that bolt down too much the cover breaks and suddenly that switch is open and triggers a fire alarm.Im guessing this is either a church dont get me started or a picture taken by a tech prerepair.

4488186,0,t1_cswd0xs,Biggest trouble with HDSDI is cable length.If youre under  you should be fine with even cheaper cable off Amazon.  But if you need the max of around  you need to make sure you have quality cable.Personally I max at  and only use that much cable if I know that it is good cable.  Anything more and Ill do fiber or have a DA.  Even still HDMI cant go a fraction of that distance.Note SDSDI can go much farther bc of less bandwidth.The biggest thing I like about HDSDI over HDMI is there are no handshakes.  You plug in SDI amp it works or it doesnt.  You dont have to plug it in then unplug amp replug to try to get both devices to do a handshake again.This is really problematic if youre trying to figure out where a problem is.  Is it the cable?  Device?  This other device?  Lets try this HDMI cable.  No try it again.  No try it a third time before trying another cable.  Ok new cable.  Try it.  Try it again.

5787347,0,t3_3ue14x,I use to reverse engineer a lot of medical equipment to create basic service manuals for them. Most manufactures would not provide service manuals to rd party repair companies even though they were required by law to.This is what you see a lot inside of medical equipment and I am willing to bet they were selling these for  to . One of the ones that really shocked me was I was tearing down an ultrasound machine it had an interface board to connect the probes to the embedded computer which was about  years old the computer itself was a low end dual Xeon and running Windows XP with no patches or service packs installed. These ultrasound machine were sold for about  without probes and the probes were  to  each. The entire system was put together with COTS parts which the retail value on everything was probably about  and the interface board they sold replacements for about  and you figure about  for the custom chassis to house it all. The software on it was very primitive and mostly just recycled code from earlier systems. So even with development costs you figure they were probably making a  profit on each one they sold.One of the kickers on this is that since these machines were used to process medical imagery you could not install any patches or service packs on them without them getting recertified so the manufactures would never spend the money to create update packages because they didnt want to pay the  recertification fee to the FDA. Many people would also figure out how to error the system out to get to the actual windows desktop on them too which would allow them to surf the internet on an unpatched unprotected system which at some sites has system level authentication to the PACs server medical records.I have also found many systems which had a PC inside and a UPS battery hot glued to the bottom of the casing with a ACDC ATX powersupply which they would sell replacement powersupplies for  I was able to order them direct from the OEM manufactures for .Needless to say I think this is one of the reasons medical expenses are so high in the US the insane markup on any piece of equipment which they need.,techsupportgore,cxeh45r,105,t5_2tnbv

Suck all air out and seal the bag as you pull the straw out.Put into bag  and do the same.Place in the freezer in the coldest part leave it for an hour.

If I wake up in the middle of the night to noises outside or inside first thing I grab is a light and my gun. What if its a robber trying to get in my car or someone crawling through a window? I live in a rural area where police response times are likely  minutes if not more. A bad guy with bad intentions can do a lot of damage in mins. Now Im assuming you live in Britain same scenario. You hear glass shatter or what sounds like a boot against a door what do you do? Hope it wasnt an intruder? Call the police and hope they arrive on time?I feel so much more comfortable knowing I can stop a threat to the important things in my life. I dont have to worry if wake to glass shattering in the middle of the night. I hear quite often about stabbings in the UK.

First a Chinese company could care less about a western Christian holiday and its arbitrary policies. The US is not their primary target market and makes up a very small percentage of their business. Second the poster above was clearly NOT interested in owning the phone or he would have switched carriers to use the phone. What does One Plus care about someone who uses a carrier that doesnt work with any of their phones?  Third you cant make some people happy. You could give out a steak and a blowjob with every purchase and some cunt will still preach for your demise because they were too daft to properly use what you sold them. It happens all the time and this is a great case of it. They didnt bend over backwards for someone WHO WILL NEVER BE THEIR CUSTOMER ANYWAYS and break their own CLEARLY STATED POLICY on a device that HAD CLEARLY POSTED SPECS to begin with. You people who expect companies to give you a tug and tuck you into bed are the reason I have to pay so much for my goods and services as a well read and researched consumer. Dealing with every thick cunt who cant read the black and white costs an obscene amount of money and odds are that same twat will bad mouth you anyways for some arbitrary nonsense. As for One Plus losing money over bad press this type of case is the least of their worries. Their devices have shite software they have serious QC issues they over hype and under deliver their ordering system is a joke their RMA and service are total shite and theyve now started a trend with big manufactures to drop prices on arguably better devices AND even with all that theyre selling phones like fanny at a naval dockyard.

Teams battle for control of the portals by hacking them which also occasionally gives you items which you can apply to portals to either help you hack them faster or protect the ones you have already better. If you visit three portals that your team controls you can link them together in a triangle. The more area the triangle covers the more points you earn for your team.People get ridiculous with this game. Going as far as linking portals together spanning countries.

Admittedly I dont know that its not actually a universal charger and if it is then it can probably output the correct voltsamps regardless whats connected to it. But still when you have to file down the physical interfaces of two electrical line components to get them to fit together thats an indication that you dont know what the fuck will happen when theyre plugged in to the wall either now or sometime down the road. This setup working when the customer dropped it off doesnt mean it should be okay for the techs to let it go back out there.Also if it is a universal charger it could have come with an adapter that would have saved the customer this trouble.

A  Gold unit can have worse internals than a  Bronze or plain  unit and still be gold because its more efficient. If you really want a longlasting PSU the best thing to do is to go to jonnyguru.com and look for a review of the unit youre going to buy.The thing about the  cert is that the PSU only passes if it is able to provide  of its power. If a unit has  its a good sign and means that you wont end up with a  W unit that can only output  watts but it doesnt say anything about protective mechanisms or build quality. Whether a unit has high quality caps NipponCC Rubycon Teapo to some extent good ripple values good voltage regulation etc. doesnt depend on its  rating. The best thing to to here is to look for reviews online.Also any halfdecent PSU wont take hardware with it when it fails  and any  unit will be halfdecent at the very least though there might be exceptions. As always do your research before buying.EDIt Looks like this turned into a ramble. Sorry bout that. What I was trying to say it this  ratings arent everything and certainly dont tell you much about build quality. and  certified unit should not take hardware with it after it dies.Also what units were you using? There is a huge variety of Bronze units from shitty group regulated deigns with the worst chinese caps you could find to very good ones like the GM with DCDC regulation halfway decent caps Capxon and an acceptable build quality. Obviously the worse units will fare poorly but a good Bronze units doesnt really have any drawbacks compared to a gold unit apart from features and slightly worse power efficiency. That said I generally agree with the statement that PSUs are a very important part of the system and should not be overlooked under any circumstances.

9522540,0,t1_d9lh9vr,Not saying its not gore but theres no way something this big would just get lost. And no hub I know of has a lost and found. If a package comes into the facility it is scanned in and appears on the manifest doesnt have a box it cannot get scanned in as the shipping label has the box and therefore goes against the Operations Manager and his crew. If the server was in a box and it came out that would be on the fault of the individual that packed it it would still be and to QA for routing information and repackaging. When something comes up missing the system compares the manifests to the final scans and its very easy to deduce where a package has gone missing and this is usually done less than  hours from a package arriving and quickly get it to where its going. Ive even seen managers deliver packages in their personal vehicles that got left behind to ensure it arrived on time. A server like this just didnt go missing or fall through the cracks its a massive heavy parcel theres no way it just went missing. Even tiny envelopes go on a scan report at the end of the day and if they disappear the work area gets some form of backlash from it even if a driver finds it and delivers it without an inbound AND work area scan on it.This was an accidental damage plain and simple. Im  positive OP will be fully reimbursed even if this was the shippers fault for lousy packaging. QA already knew this and just boxed the damaged goods up so they could be delivered and a claim could filed by the recipient.Plus in every hub Ive worked in mishandling a package to cause damage such is this is an on the spot firing offense.tldr Theres no lost and found in hubs and even if there were no manager would let something this huge just sit around on their floor district evaluation would see them fired if they did. OP WILL get fully reimbursed. If youre shipping something irreplaceableheavy dont pack it in cardboard unless you have  miles of padding between it and the outside of the box because most hubs see k packages come in on a normal day inside of  hours and you arent the only asshole shipping heavy stuff and gravity is a thing and unfortunately accidents happen.,techsupportgore,d9mushg,0,t5_2tnbv

11365716,0,t3_626ouz,Weve been using the Bose L compacts at work for  years not a single issue and they sound great. I wouldnt exactly compare them to beats by dre. They are sleek and subtle especially for high class events where you dont want huge PA on tri pods. Maybe the home stuff sucks but I cant complain about the live event equipment we have. Its also less intimidating for people who dont have experience with PA systems and need to rent one. They are no replacement for  Watt powered monitor but for smaller events they are great. ,techsupportgore,dfka62c,3,t5_2tnbv
