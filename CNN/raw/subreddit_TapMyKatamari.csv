7614188,0,t1_d35mj8f,Yeah I had this issue too but Im from Canada sometimes all I had to do was force close the app and it would work  You can try that and see if it works for you.,TapMyKatamari,d37oz4w,1,t5_3bgoi
7970235,0,t3_4oapfs,Getting your Prince to lv.  translates to roughly completing anywhere from stage  to . Also note you earn your first Star Token at stage  which allows you to purchase your first Present!,TapMyKatamari,d4bxhfz,7,t5_3bgoi
8244508,0,t3_4s9h9o,All of the presents increase your Helpful multiplier increasing based on present level which increases both tap and idle damage. I dont think the stars do anything on their own in this game. ,TapMyKatamari,d584anr,3,t5_3bgoi
8248296,0,t1_d58ilfn,And you should know its for active tapper. Passive player needs helpful or gold mojo. I think they need another tip,TapMyKatamari,d58lcm5,2,t5_3bgoi

8604394,0,t3_4xerof,I am having a problem postupdate. I bought the first cosmic present the regal cloak and levelled it to . Then I spent a few star pieces to get the next cosmic present and the game froze. Now the regal cloaks stats are stuck at level  and the upgrade button is gone. Is there anything I can do to troubleshoot it? I tried hard exiting and reopening the game as well as restarting my phone but the problem persists.,TapMyKatamari,d6h56hx,1,t5_3bgoi
8624434,0,t3_4xsygv,Yeah one of the ads I viewed since the update completely froze the game and also my phone. I had to restart it.,TapMyKatamari,d6jnn55,2,t5_3bgoi
8639065,0,t3_4xywfk,Just an update on hotfix release date. We had to resubmit the hotfix to our publishers to address a critical problem with our Ad networks this has consequently pushed our release date to early next week. Once we have more information to share we will let everyone know! Thanks again for your patience and understanding. ,TapMyKatamari,d6lhpt6,5,t5_3bgoi
8656578,0,t3_4y7lee,Sounds like we need k stars to get to Twinkle. Now that sounds far... Still I was once at  with the Language glitch and often I couldnt pass the next challenge so getting to  is quite an achievement with the help of the Cosmos presents. Still the max stage is  so you are slight pass half way there but I think you might have seen it all in term of the scenaries offered in late stages. You might need to wait for more powerful presents orand cousins to show up to advance further at this point.,TapMyKatamari,d6noraa,1,t5_3bgoi
8767393,0,t3_4zw9p9,What we need to do is disable the ad networks which are causing the crashes we are also in contact with our ad mediator to work out this issue on their end. If any of you provide details as to what ads you were watching before the crash occurred that would help us track down this issue even quicker. Even better if you wait until the end of the ad the ad network will show in the final screen. Examples of ad networks are unity ads or adcolony. ,TapMyKatamari,d71l5qn,3,t5_3bgoi
9402020,0,t3_59dvze,Yep I was hoping this would have been addressed,TapMyKatamari,d97rtg4,3,t5_3bgoi
11410479,0,t1_dfm29ns,No benefits late game taking special cousins to .Kings appear approximately every  minutes but tapping can reduce that cool down. Theres a limit to how many ads you can watch in a given hour because they reduced the number of ad networks they have now so watch ads only for things you want before you run out of ads for that sitting. They also do not show up when magnetic heart or coin soul is running.I dont think presents have been touched since . upgrade. They did rebalance cousins and when you can buy them. When you refilled made a new star your cousins random mojos may have been more magical when you went your furthest and this run you have fewer magical to boost your push. Also mushrooms arent permanent any more so you may have had mushrooms active before without knowing it.Lastly as you get stronger with Mask you collect fewer coins until you hit your wall. Regularly pause when you notice a slowdown before it crawls to millions of taps to collect objects and earn coins.,TapMyKatamari,dfpd5ye,2,t5_3bgoi
