1625425,0,t1_cjk0w58,In terms of strength It goes EgtSgt Carbon. Carbon is a little stronger then sglass but is more stiff. Epoxy is just the highest quality resin used for skimboards. Most pros go for carbon. OC is best for skimboarding. Aliso park beach is good and the wedge. Most of the beaches around Laguna would be pretty fun. ,skimboarding,cjk1tjs,2,t5_2s40j
1646554,0,t1_cjmktbj,Okay a couple of tips that helped me a ton...Learn the technique of catching a wave by running towards the wave at more of an angle. Although you see most pros going straight out wrapping the wave and getting barreled this is the hardest way to get wrap and it requires perfect technique and a powerful wave. A good way to learn the technique is to run at more of an angle to the wave so that your turn doesnt have to be as sharp. Youll also have a better chance of timing it correctly since youll be able to adjust.When it comes to your timing if youre sinking youre probably to early. If it crashes before you get there youre obviously late. If its picking you up and throwing painfully back to shore youre timing it perfectly and just need to learn to ride it properly.Lastly the type of wave is important. The technique for wrapping a wave where I live Florida is completely different to wrapping a wave at Aliso. The best way to learn exactly how to wrap the waves at your break is to literally just watch other riders. This goes for everything in skimboarding. Watching and talking to riders who are better than you is how everyone gets better and not only can you watch what there doing but you can cheat off their timing too.I hope this helped! ,skimboarding,cjmpmu0,3,t5_2s40j

4673978,0,t1_ctjkznm,Make sure you have hands on both sides of the board when you throw it it keeps it straight. Also shift your weight back to keep it straight when your on the board. Look up Zaps tutorials on their website.,skimboarding,ctjpezb,1,t5_2s40j
