Its safe to assume they know you were rejected to the cadet program and anything you said during that application had better match your application to become a police officer or it will be grounds for automatic dismissal should you ever get hired. Save yourself the headache and apply to a different department or look to serve as a civil servant in a different capacity. ,nypd,dbi9tcs,3,t5_2ugdz
