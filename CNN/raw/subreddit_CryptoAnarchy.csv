1805263,0,t3_2f4ohw,Property damage.  A person runs an internet service and youre specifically sending garbage to it so that persons service cannot run properly. Its like throwing heaps and heaps of garbage in front of a brick and mortar store such that customers cant come in.  Or perhaps more accurately staging a protest of sorts where you literally fill the store with people who will not buy anything.,CryptoAnarchy,ck6p5up,1,t5_2smdi

6012454,0,t1_cy7m9sg,I would support unban thats crazy everything you wrote is true. Capitalists pretending to be anarchists should be just as offensive to anarchists as racists homophones or islamaphobes pretending to be anarchists. If a neonazi was called out for ignorance nobody wouldve banned you for it so why the fuck are these ignoramuses being given special privileges like we need to tiptoe around the issue. Do people not realize whats going to happen to these dumbass kids if they ever leave their gated republican communities and bring that ignorance to a major city?!If anything being mean to them here on the internet is saving them a welldeserved future beatdown. Hell we might even be saving their lives if they had were still capitalists when the revolution comes they might have been hung after the capitalism Nuremberg trials.Anyway theyre beyond our help believe me Ive tried reasoning with them. Remember that these fuckwits have the entire compendium of human knowledge at their fingertips their ignorance ignorance is willful  choice. ,CryptoAnarchy,cy7rf88,1,t5_2smdi
