But most of them seems to be about unfinished features.After I implemented my suggestions I think I see why you made those parameters mutableIn menu you pass the input buffer along with ampmut input since input is a ampmut  that becomes ampmut ampmut String which requires the reference itself to be mutable but autodereferences to the expected type.Figuring out when you need to borrow or dereference can be tricky and I frequently change stuff until it compiles too.   But you rarely need to add mut before the colon.It seems like you have trouble changing the file name you could do let mut filename  FCScataloged.csv.tostring but the perfect solution is to use stdborrowCow    use stdborrowCow    let mut filename  CowBorrowedFCScataloged.csv         gt  filename  CowOwnednewfilename,rustcodereview,d3m6z0z,2,t5_329tf
