108268,0,t1_ceqr0ce,Granada is in all your options so that one is a given but I would definitely pick Sevilla over Toledo and Valencia. If youre looking for a day trip out of Madrid Id suggest Segovia famous for the huge Roman aqueduct and the Alcazar. Another great stop would be Cordoba home of La Mezquita on the way from Sevilla to Granada. ,spain,ceqrb54,4,t5_2qhd6

460584,0,t3_1x8xuj,I did the Camino from St. John Pied de Port France to Santiago de Compostella once about  years ago and then a year or  after I tried it again but only got to do about  or so kms did the first  or so then hurt my knee took a couple of days off and then took a train to the end and did the last  kms.Other peoples input on the money is right  would be way too much for the trail. I wouldnt take that much with you on the hike it could get stolen it happens but I never really heard of it on my hikes. I had about  euros at one point and one of the women running a hostel told me it wasnt a good idea to have that much on me.If you start in St. John they will give you  maps one for the first day through the Pyernnes and one that covers the rest of the hike with elevations and distances.This is the map book I took I thought it was great. Its small and it had almost all the info I needed and was extremely helpful.I did the extension to Finisterre and I would highly recommend it if you have the time. It takes about  or so extra days and it was great. Not nearly as many people do it and ends right at the ocean.Some days you will likely end up sleeping on the floor if hostels are all full. I would recommend bringing some sort of sleeping pad in addition to your sleeping bag so you are more comfortable. I didnt have a sleeping pad and sure wish I had brought one at some points!Read up on how to treat a blister  you poke a hole in it using a needle and then working from one side towards the hole you squeeze out the blister.

527665,0,t3_2053xr,I actually am from Huelva. I could tell you all you need to know about the city feel free to ask.The city itself is pretty small and doesnt really have much if anything to see as an earthquake destroyed pretty much every old building and stuff. However it has one of the best coastlines in andalucia except for Matalascaas which is the beach for people from out of Huelva basically Sevilla and a really beautiful countryside or mountains la sierra. The nightlife is... pretty much nonexistent once youve been living here for a year or even less. Theres really only one place for bars which you can count with both hands and several little discos in the city center and in the outskirts. Nevertheless as a foreigner I guess you could meet the erasmus community which is pretty big and I know for a fact they do have great times with their erasmus parties and such.People dont speak english. Plain and simple. But they will try. And that can be funny so thats ok I guess xD People here is pretty open with people from other countries in general of course but you could also find the exact opposite. As in everywhere I guess.If you want to know anything else just let me know!,spain,cg0931c,2,t5_2qhd6

Theres always a bit of a debate but Catalan and Valencian are basically the same language especially if you follow the official grammar. The only differences are in the accent and a small part of the vocabulary but theyre mutually intelligible.

765106,0,t1_cgqlm42,Its ok you really dont need to go to the most expensive restaurants to experience Basque cuisine as in most cases the best things are in some regular traditional places.gtDo you suggest any specific places for pintxos?The best are without any doubt the ones served at bars in the Old Town. Pintxos similarly to Spanish tapas are associated to bars and not so much to bigger restaurants and just like everywhere else in the Basque Country the Old Town has probably the best places. The traditional thing is to visit several different bars in a row and in each have a pintxo or two and some wine. This is called poteo. Its matter of exploring and finding the best places. Theres everything from traditional onbread pintxos to some others very carefully prepared and with plenty of different ingredients. gtWe are also looking forward to the seafoodThe Basque coast is very well known for its seafood Basques have been renowned fishermen for over a millennia. Dishes like merluza a la vasca marmitako de bonito bacalao al pil pil chipirones squid en su tinta and many many others. Youll find plenty of restaurants specialized in seafood both Basque dishes and other Cantabric ones too all across the Basque Country but especially in cities like Donostia and Zarautz. Basques are also avid meat eaters so you wont find any shortage of it. Some other minor things you should try are txistorra Basque chorizo txakoli Basque white wine and Idiazabal cheese gtThe order of the trip looks like Barcelona gt French Basque someplace gt Donostia gt Zarautz gt Bilbao gt Madrid just FYIFollows a logical order so its ok. Between Zarautz and Bilbao following the coast road is Gaztelugatxe which I think it is worth making a quick visit it is very scenic. Not far is the Butron Castle ,spain,cgr8xv5,1,t5_2qhd6

2388316,0,t3_2mplqy,It depends on what you prefer. Madrid is a large busy city with tons of cultural features and nightlife and Valencia is a smaller city with the same stuff but to a lesser degree. I lived in Ganda a town about an hour south of Valencia and commuted into Valencia for work. What I liked about Valencia was that it was big enough to have plenty of entertainment and culture but small enough that you could get to know it well and not feel too lost. Also its very easy to take day trips out from Valencia to smaller coastal or inland towns which is really where you can experience a different kind of authentic Spanish culture. Also in general I found Valencianos to be friendly and laid back possibly moreso than Madrileos. I have some tips for day trips for either city if you are interested.

On the other hand the people that own the house have to pay bills and mortgages. Something similar happened to my family. We had someone renting a house owned by my mother and decided to stop paying. She left the house the day before the Juzgado decided she was to be evicted. We lost a lot of money because of her rent water electricity lawyer.Botelln Set up areas where people can drink. Banning something will make people do it even more.  Smoking weed The state has no business dictating individuals what they can or can not put into their own bodies. They can not say here these drugs are fine alcohol medication nicotine and these drugs are bad weed  Leaving furniture in the street Where I live the parque ecolgico is open monfri during regular office hours. Most people clear out old junk during the weekends. Most people simply put it next to the green bins I wonder if that also falls under this law?    Disrespecting a police officer Disrespect is not actually defined in this law. Are we talking about hitting officers? Telling them to fuck off?

Most hotels are located there but youll hardly see anything else than fellow tourists. Its mostly packageholiday and allinclusive hotels at all price levels as well as apartments. If you want to stay for a week for little money holiday apartments are the way to go. Playa de las Americas is slightly more upscale than Los Cristianos.The Northwest of the island around Puerto de la Cruz is where the tourism development started back in the s and s. Those hotels are rather tired now and the weather is less sunny than in the South but on the other hand you can see more interesting landscapes.Beware that during the summer Easter and Christmas holidays the prices in those tourist areas can be much higher than in the low season.Finally the island capital Santa Cruz and the university town of La Laguna are located at the North East. Santa Cruz in particular is a surprisingly livable city. Most hotels there are geared towards business travellers. They can be surprisingly cheap during weekends and holidays but are quite expensive during regular weekdays. To stay there try something like Airbnb.,spain,cv8xsy8,1,t5_2qhd6

I know it sounds as every new driver that has ever failed but the guy was ruthless he even had a mirror to check the distance with the car behind you and was just an amargao. He was also saying I could not get examined because there was  number missing from my DNI until the teacher asked if it couldnt be solved in the office just after the exam. He didnt ask me to do anything ilegal he just said it a way that at least I misinterpreted because its not the natural way I would have said it. To clear it up imagine a roundabout with exitsstreets at where  and  would be in  on a clock. I was entering from . He said the second one you can take the one at  was a one way street entering the roundabout so I couldnt use it. I exited at  and he actually meant I had to exit at  third entrance to the roundabout but nd one I could use because the first  was only an entrance Have I cleared it up?

9173759,0,t1_d8e0vyc,There is a difference between being a pedant and pointing out when someone is claiming to be using a traditional recipe with a twist while he does nothing at all like in the original. Paella rice is not stirred so it doesnt stick he says to stir it regularly.Paella ingredients never include stickycaramelizing stuff like onion carrot or chorizo he drops all three in his twist. Paella rice is boiled in a very precise amount of water to obtain the socarrat or slightly burned rice at the bottom with an extra amount of oils and flavors. Finally at the bottom of the web he links a YouTube video about paella that explicitly contradicts everything he says on the recipe. Of course there are millions of people who add or remove a couple ingredients in their homemade version of paella. But this is not about being a purist of the official recipe its something basic that goes beyond that when your rice does not follow any of the essential steps to make paella and your rice texture is caramelized and sticky from the starch of the rice onion and fat of chorizo and you also do not even use saffron or add any of the traditional ingredients... What is there left in the dish that makes it any more similar to a paella than any other rice recipe such as arroz montas risotto or Chinese threedelight rice? The yellow colour? Its a nice rice recipe maybe its even a nice homage to Spanish rice dishes but there is simply nothing in there that is even remotely similar to a paella. Unless you are  so shallow that you think any rice with anything to do with Spain is called paella. In that case I could pour a bottle of Rioja in a pot of white rice and you would still be OK with calling that paella.FYI I would be OK with cooking in my home a paella with chorizo but the proper socarrat cooking. I would be OK with a paella with carrot and onion as long as it has the proper meats and cooking. And I would be OK with a caramelized rice with the vegetables and meats usually found in paella. But if you change absolutely every single step and still call it a paella thats like making fish n chips by boiling in water chicken and aubergines. ,spain,d8eub7m,6,t5_2qhd6

However that song was not made by or for our country. None of the performers are Spaniards Osmani Garcia and Pitbull are Cubans and Sensato del Patio is Dominican the video has Caribbean themes and the lyrics have sexual doubleentendres that will not be understood by most Spains Spanish speakers.That said some native Spanish people do like that kind of music. Its far less popular than our own or the USA music superstars but you can always find songs like that in clubs or the radio in the summertime not so much in winter though. And since there are so many LatinAmerica immigrants in Spain now and there are even whole radio channels for them those music genres are becoming more known.I personally dont like that kind of stuff but objectively speaking I think the song youve linked is not that bad even though the video is kind of terrible.,spain,daheavx,17,t5_2qhd6
