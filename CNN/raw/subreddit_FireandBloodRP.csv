Lady Daena a pleasant surprise. A stern glance of warning was offered Joseth before a petite hand was caught up in his own warm lips brushed over knuckles as smooth as Myrish silk.

By now the bowmen had made their way to a small grouping of somewhat concealed foxholes on the West side of the road closer to the roadblock. Soon they would be close to the traps they had set up where the killing field was supposed to be. For some reason the group hadnt been pursued and it wasnt until Wart did a headcount that he had realized exactly why Frederick and Georg hadnt made it back with them.
