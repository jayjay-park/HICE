688743,0,t3_220m0m,I have been wondering the same and bought a  tv from a thrift store but it was broken   BE REALLY CAREFUL.  The inside components of CRT monitors operate at HIGH VOLTAGE.  Never work on a CRT while it is plugged in and wait several minutes after its been plugged in before doing and more work.  Inside there will be a large coil of copper wire.

Also make sure youre not editing the header information if you zoom in it should be distinguishable from the rest of the soundAlso sometimes the image will break if the sound is longershorter than the original file. Particularly if you open it as a stereo file and one track is longer than the other. BMP files can be interesting but I always seem to have the best results with RAW and TIF files.

Code exists so we dont have to explain it in English I guess.Sure enough the th or something time I try to read through the original sort code I get it. The resulting gradients between the points of black threshold make a lot of sense now as well as why this script would work so well in something like a star field with a lot of random sudden white points.Im going to dig back into your version to see what you incremented to make the brightness move and hopefully implement a rapidly drying molasses feel to indexMode.  It might be fun to apply the brightness incrementing to whiteness too which will probably result in chaos beauty or Vanilla Ice  the final point of whiteness.,glitch_art,cj6vhjh,1,t5_2sg61

8103940,0,t1_d4qp7pg,Edit I made a script to automate this process. You can find it with my other scripts on Github Please still read my guide if you want to understand how it works.Sure. So all the info you need is in the GIF specification If you like solving things yourself you can work it out from that. Otherwise Ill walk you through it here.Okay go ahead and open a gif in your favourite hex editor. I use bless First off lets get acquainted with the GIF file format. As defined in the spec the GIF header is   bytes consisting of GIF    and the version number    in my case.This is immediately followed by  bytes of the logical screen descriptor. The first  bytes of which define the screen width E . This may seem wrong at first glance but realise it is stored in little endian form. So E  is actually  E. Python is a great tool to quickly check hex binary and ascii values. Open up the interactive Python shell and enter xE then enter xE. x is a common prefix to denote hexadecimal values for binary we use b. For the second value Python returns  as expected. Bless has a checkbox at the bottom of the window to decode values in little endian this allows you to read the true value in the Unsigned  bit box. The next byte is a structure of bits so we will need to read it as a binary value. If your hex editor doesnt support this just throw it at python binxD. This returns b. The only bits we care about here are the first and the last . The first bit is a flag that informs us of the presence of a global colour table immediately following the logical screen descriptor. This is  so it does exist in this gif most gifs will have this. The last  bits are used to calculate the size of the colour table. The actual number of bytes it contains is equal to  x Size of Global Color Table. So to skip past this we take the offset of the end of the logical screen descriptor and add the result of that expression. In python   b returns . In Bless we can goto this position with CtrlG. Now in the case of this gif theres some kind of metadata or something packed in here. I think theoretically you can hide whatever data you want in here.Everything following the logical screen descriptor is optional in a functional GIF image this is the main meat of the file. Frames of an animated gif each have their own block of data called an image descriptor. To distinguish image descriptors from other data they all start with an image separator of fixed value of C. I will paste in the specs diagram of image descriptor syntax here since it is very helpful.                         Field Name                    Type                 |               |       Image Separator               Byte                 |               |       Image Left Position           Unsigned                              |               |                 |               |       Image Top Position            Unsigned                              |               |                 |               |       Image Width                   Unsigned                              |               |                 |               |       Image Height                  Unsigned                              |               |                 | | | |   |     |       ltPacked Fieldsgt               See below                      ltPacked Fieldsgt        Local Color Table Flag         Bit                                 Interlace Flag                 Bit                                 Sort Flag                      Bit                                 Reserved                       Bits                                 Size of Local Color Table      BitsByte number is on the left bit number on the top. Now for gifs with frames that all completely fill the image the  bytes after the image separator will be . So if like me you are having trouble finding the first image descriptor use the find function of your hex editor to search for C    . Here is where we exploit the format. As you should see we know the values of everything in the image descriptor. In the final byte is our target the interlace flag. Using the Find and replace function of your hex editor copy the entire image descriptor into the Search for field in my case C     E  E  . Then copy it again into the Replace with field. However we need the second bit of the final byte the interlace flag to be . We can use bitwise operators in python for this hexb | x. This uses a bitwise OR to set the second bit to  while retaining the values of the other bits. Python returns x so replace the final byte with that in the Replace with field. In Bless you will have to scroll up to the top and click on the first byte to make sure the find function goes through everything. Now click Replace all save and were done!If Search and replace only finds  occurrence or if you cant find any image descriptor using the method described above your gif is likely optimised with varying image descriptor values. One fix for this is to open the image in GIMP and run Filters gt Animation gt Unoptimise. An overall better approach is to script the whole process. I will be doing this later and putting it on Github along with a few other scripts.Sorry if you didnt want that detailed of a walkthrough I wasnt expecting it to be this big haha.TL DR search and replace ,glitch_art,d4qyf2i,11,t5_2sg61
