Rosss sudden departure just seems odd to me especially when he has so many fans on YouTube Reddit twitter etc. but best to luck to you Ross! Also go Sun Devils. pWhat you guys are all hinting at about Phils and Rosss friendship playing into this definitely seems probable. However do not bring Phil down.

Your right arm you can kinda struggle out but you have to let go of the knife. Now theres a news helicopter thats just flying above you and if you can just wave to them you could signal them and they could come get you in about  hours. But the twist is theres a very large horny silverback gorilla that is gonna buttfuck you for all  of those hours on live television as the news broadcasts in AROUND THE WORLD. Your only other option is to use the knife to cut off your dick and its just gone completelyyou cant get it back and you can get away safely.

Theres no moderator because of a free app that covers that duty so everyone can play. During the Day phase you try to deduce the werewolves or lie to protect them just like in normal Werewolf. At the end of a set time everyone points at who they want to kill. If a Werewolf dies the villagers win. If a villager dies the Werewolves win. It plays really fast.

Sourcefed and Phil are not afraid to use the ladies to get views and it wouldnt surprise me if one of Megs more attractive factors when it came to hiring was how sexuality open she is. This is shown particularly in the female posters that Sourcefed sells. The posters seem a little objectificationoffemales but the girls agreed to it so whatever. It makes them come off as a little shady to me personally and not as respectable as they think they are. more evidence Phils thumbnails.

My thoughts on the thing were come next episode it will all make sense and all that outrage will have seemed pointless. Its not like it was the season finale.

6410482,0,t3_3v0qpy,In regards to turns and order of turns. When combat starts you can have everyone roll a D as Initiative and the higher the roll the faster you act and that can determines turn order. That way everyone gets a turn and you dont have one person taking turn after turn without the others getting to do something. Also if they roll to see hiding enemies ect they could get a bonus on initiative because they will see them coming to attack D ,SourceFed,czib2qf,3,t5_2tiwp

7237117,0,t3_4ejxcm,My only question is why,SourceFed,d20t3fe,12,t5_2tiwp
7237756,0,t1_d1qghwx,Yes I saw the same thing. At the outset of the battle system it appeared someone always took damage during an opposing attack roll. Meaning the attacker would deal damage if they got higher  or they would receive damage if the defender rolled higher. But then this seems to have been changed later or it could have simply been an accident on Maudes part at the time... or maybe some enemies have opportunity attacks and some dont.They point is later it was if the attacker rolled higher they dealt damage but if the defender rolled higher or even the same as the attacker then no damage was dealt. AND the attacker must roll at least a  as well. So if the attacker rolls higher but still under  then they miss. This was especially shown by when the Heroes had to still roll to hit the Rodent Of Unusual Size when it was immobilized in the cage. It couldnt defend but they still had to roll a  or higher. Now this has usually been true  except some times when enemies seemed to attack even though they rolled below   in Ep.  when the Panther successfully hit Linge by rolling a  over his . Also sometimes Maude chooses not to roll against the players so as long as they get a  or higher then they hit. So overall this system seems to be the permanent one with the Mauderator adding little tweaks based on the situation.Also though was it addressed as to when players can deal multiple attacks per turn or major mortal wounds aiming for the head throat etc.? Because if its just whenever they ask to then they might as well ask to every time. I love double attacks but I was confused as to when they were allowed to. Was it some type of skill or...? Or maybe just when they have the upperhand such as in a Blinding Shadowed area.Anyways though I did have a few questions I like that the system is rather relaxed. I think the fewer rolls to makemechanics to worry about the faster we can move through the story. Great job everyone! And thanks for everything Maude.,SourceFed,d20vpfg,1,t5_2tiwp
