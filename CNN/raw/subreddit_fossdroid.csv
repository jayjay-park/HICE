5514392,0,t1_cwg9gaa,I agree. One of the issues is that the fuzzy problem is compounded when searches are done abroad especially if the language is not Latin script or if it uses cases...,fossdroid,cwgiild,2,t5_2t8ev
7577278,0,t3_4j1t8i,Ive noticed a lack of software for Android Wear devices available on FDroid. I understand the the only way Wear devices can communicate with the phone is through proprietary software this makes a jail for any free software on the platform including the whole of Android Wear on AOSP. But does this require any proprietary software to be build the apps? Can there be Android Wear features reliant on GPS that are unused to GPSfree users?TLDR Are Android Wear apps proprietary by themself and are apps with Wear support considered play service required?,fossdroid,d33i0je,1,t5_2t8ev

8735443,0,t3_4zotuq,More contextI dont get the argument though taking AOSP and profiting is exactly what they do and is allowed by the license.,fossdroid,d6xkta4,4,t5_2t8ev
9032336,0,t1_d7xjdll,Conversations ChatSecure and Zom are all XMPP clients which should be interoperable. The nice thing about XMPP is its like email.if you dont like a client choose another one. If you want to use a different server no problem. If you are using a custom domain you dont even have to give out a new address to your contacts. ,fossdroid,d7xjl5g,2,t5_2t8ev
9062803,0,t1_d80vhe3,So phone addressbook integration works on Android and iOS but currently just searches for email addresses.  So right now if you know the email address or the matrix ID its all good.  In the near future well also support discovery by phone number.  We also need to add in a general contact directory of some kind but havent decided what itll look like yet ,fossdroid,d817axs,2,t5_2t8ev
9882526,0,t1_davpfjy,Thank you for your reply.  To be honest that is my current solution as well.  I do find it a bit clunky though and since setting up my shiny new server I was hoping for a better solution.  I find syncthing settings really confusing and complex.  I just cant get my mind around it and the android app doesnt seem to be working half the time.,fossdroid,davpt72,2,t5_2t8ev
9883639,0,t1_davsb22,Is that something you could script?  I was secretly hoping someone had a nice setup using rsync and cron they could share with me D.Not sure these are even appropriate tools but it sounds good!,fossdroid,davv1h6,1,t5_2t8ev
