2199475,0,t1_cljdoqy,Also cost is something Im trying to determine which is why I asked here what kind of temperature water flowquality air flowquality humidity etc ranges growers grow in. Once I understand the max and min operating ranges I can pick the sensors I would use and get a more exact idea on price. Again this is with commercial not corporate just the larger forprofit growers already in Washington Colorado California etc who work with large scale growing operations growers in mind people with a bit deeper pockets but the costs would be a LA carte so you only get the features you wantneed and would like range from kk. ,macrogrowery,cljeojg,2,t5_2u4nb

5847288,0,t3_3v9ay2,Height might not be but light penetration will be. Light is only going to go so deep into the canopy. Typically if youre looking to have the biggest indoor plants possible then youll want some vertical lights between the plants.,macrogrowery,cxm3vu1,2,t5_2u4nb

11747536,0,t3_67iiul,Imo the best cureprwvention against spidermites is getting them.yourselves. I gotspidermites  years ago but didnt realise it just noticed the leaves getting spots. Ecentually I let a few branches go past maturation to let some seeds ripen off and I saw some webs which gave me a clue.Now I can detect a single mite on.my seedlings by the very specific white spots on the upside of the leaf and immefiatly sqush itwith my finger. I also looked trpugh my picturesfrom years ago recently and I already see sidermites clearlyvisible pretty early in the season and I find it syrange I didnt notice them back then.,macrogrowery,dgrm2do,2,t5_2u4nb
11810500,0,t1_dgypdh5,Any light is bad light? Why do you say that?OP is correct in that clearly moonlight doesnt cause plants to reveg and if a normal ceiling globe is useless for growing I wonder if switching it on for  mins to look at your plants after lights out would actually do anything.,macrogrowery,dgyrexs,0,t5_2u4nb
