2945360,0,t1_co2vvjg,It still really doesnt make the situation any more understandable or acceptable.  Being perpetually out of stock on items you source from other vendors as well as items produced by a company that you have a financial interest in is laughable.  The only reason Good Guy is able to exist is because the ecigarette market is still in its infancy.  As I said in my original comment their business is unsustainable because they are incompetent business people.  More savvy BampMs and online vendors who are actually able to reliably sell people product will force them out of the market eventually.,NJ_Vaping,co2wg2z,1,t5_2y8vr
3296005,0,t3_2xw6tu,You know I have been hoping for a good store to show up for a while now. I live in the Oranges. I have high hopes even if half of your posts are just you guys claiming to be the best. Where will your store be located?Edit Upon doing some searches it seems like your juices are all expensive as hell. Youre selling dangerous batteries and overcharging for them as well as not even listing the batteries specs. Your mods are notclearly labeled as clones or authentic. Not to mention your starter kits are ridiculous.  for a single battery ego kit Are you serious? I will not be visiting your store based on all of this and I am going to tell everyone I know to stay far away from you. Crooks.,NJ_Vaping,cp3yytz,5,t5_2y8vr
3414245,0,t3_2xw6tu,Whats up bro I saw your post and yea I believe you on things being ridiculous out here. Well Ive been vaping for roughly two years. I started off on everything from getting ripped off at seaside one weekend on a ego and from there I jumped on my first mech mod. Of course you know the fun and pleasure anyone gets out of having a goodeffective and affordable device. Ive worked for a few vape stores. Im not one to bad talk other stores because I understand some people are in it for the money. They see the profit to come in vaping in the future. But its not about that its about getting good products and having people happy. And blowing clouds of course. Well come through  Bloomfield ave Artisanvaporcompany we carry most Authentic mods and the ones that arent you know are top quality competition clones such as the carbon fiber fuhattan. We carry our  flavors on our Classic line our lab made cloud chaser serieslonghorn juices  and of also space jam juices. I love vaping what works and gives me what I expect you know. Come through open from ,NJ_Vaping,cphg5t2,0,t5_2y8vr
