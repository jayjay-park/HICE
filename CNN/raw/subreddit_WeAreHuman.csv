3220357,0,t1_covsarm,Yeah you are correct. Like I said the argument is materialistic. But just to counter argue the nature of the gap is that people who currently dealing with having three hots and a cot and a roof over their head are potentially the same people who want to be equal with those who have megayachts.The point I was trying to make is that the people on the social structure who are more disadvantaged dont generally want to meet in the middle or meet at their level they see the megayacht owners and they want to be megayacht owners. In a material world this doesnt work not enough yachts to go around. But in the social context that we are talking about is it possible to have equal rights without degrading the megayacht owners?,WeAreHuman,covsji3,1,t5_3741a
