838247,0,t3_23qf6l,Well this is a reddit topic I sure can expound on.   I was opposed to even trying it.  Thought it was vulgar and wanted nothing to do with it.  This was back in the days when I was still vanilla.    My ex and I had been married for about  years and we were in bed one night right after making love and of course the slick slimy stuff was still between my legs.  We were spooning and the ex got another erection and began sliding his cock up and down the crack of my ass and very very gently pushing the head of his prick into my rectum.  Eventually he managed to get the whole thing in there and by then I was so worked up that I got in on the action and enjoyed myself to the nth degree.  Forever after I have absolutely loved anal sex.  of course I also like all the rest of it too!!!   But slow and patient with gentle persuasion is the key to anal intercourse.  A woman has to first lose her virginity the breaking of the hymen and I believe there is something at the back of her mind that makes her feel that anal sex is going to hurt as bad as that did.  My opinion only of course.,BDSMtalk,cgzk84c,2,t5_31ep5
853561,0,t3_23wr3k,Yeah its pain.  And I dont really enjoy itit kind of pisses me offbut it has the same effect that others might get from more classically pleasurable stimuli.  And classically pleasurable stimuli leaves me flat. Ive recently discovered with the help of a friend that I can orgasm from a painful grip on the outer thigh.  The grip has to be hard enough to leave a bruise and it takes a little while but it happens.  Whod a thunk? ,BDSMtalk,ch1azt5,1,t5_31ep5

899594,0,t3_24f8kf,In short. I believe the lifestyle can become dangerous or unhealthy when people with unfinished business use the lifestyle to deal with their baggage. Of course growth is part of Ds but I see so many postings of slaves and subs who are abused because they themselves are not emotionallymentally healthy. I also have seen dominants who are simply control freaks who probably are more ODD  OCD or NPs with controlling amp abusives tendencies. We all have our baggage and hopefully most of us deal with them appropriately through other support systems outside of Ds but for those who dont...I worry for them. ,BDSMtalk,ch6jelz,2,t5_31ep5

963724,0,t1_chcegpy,I appreciate your input SO much I kind of stole your idea. I sat him down pulled up a few different pages let him look into it and we tried our first play last night! The reason I say I stole your idea is he was open to trying it and we started out small like me laying next to the bed until he wants me in it. I really enjoyed it we talked a bit and we agreed to a Ms relationship at home but he doesnt want to control me  which I respect. Anywho I just wanted to say thank you!!,BDSMtalk,chdu1zc,1,t5_31ep5
1028945,0,t3_25vzl7,Like you pointed out the issues arent always black and white.  Sure its easy for Me to sit here and say that Im not going to tell My sub to run out in front of a bus or do some other fool hearty thing.  That doesnt mean that some of the decisions I make today dont have a potential of causing harm.  The truth of the matter is in some cases theres honestly no way for Me to know.  I cant possibly predict the outcome of every decision that I will ever make.  I dont think anyone can.  The best anyone can do is make the best decisions they can with the information that is available to them.  Oddly enough some decisions can be rather difficult.  I have one in front of Me that I know is going to make someone very unhappy.  In fact its going to hurt.  When I say that I dont mean the fun kind of hurt that I usually deal with.  In fact its going to distress him a great deal.  It wouldnt surprise Me a bit if at this time he will think it is harming him.  Still hes going to be told that he has to accept it.  All hell really have to go on is the fact that I am making this decision based on what I believe is for the best.  Hell have to rely on the trust he needs to have in Me and the faith that Im not intentionally harming him.  That probably wont be especially easy but its something that he is going to have to do.  At some time later well be looking back on this particular decision and then we can weigh out if it really was for the best.  Only time will tell if My thinking on the matter today was right or wrong.  ,BDSMtalk,chl8w7y,2,t5_31ep5
1048980,0,t3_264axh,in my own relationships adult relationships religion and personal beliefs are respected even if not in agreement. i dont know that i could tolerate someone else trying to convert me to their way of belief. we are at an impasse.in my former relationship my partner was opposed to abortion siting religious reasons. As my pregnancy continued and some testing was done our differences on abortion came to a head and i knew in my heart that a certain decision that i may have had to make would in effect end our relationship instantly. i came to terms with that reality and made my decision knowing that i would be devastated AND suddenly single in one foul swoop. i was unable to change how i felt and i resigned myself to the potential reality. Luckily for everyone involved...that particular thing never came to reality.Fast forward to present day...my um believes in God. i do not. i have discussed it with him in age appropriate ways and found his thinking to be not only in tune with his personality and to be held dear to him...being fully aware that due to his age i could crush these thoughts with very little effort.So i drive him to church as often as i am able. Its a church of my choosing and one that is the least offensive to my own line of thought. It is not for me to decide for him what is right in this regard. i do explain to him often my opinion on the matter and he explains his feelings on it to me.  It is my feeling that he is his own person and i am here to keep him safe until such a time as he can do so on his own. Judging from the multiple bruises and cuts...i may be at this for a while but it is not my place to change who he decides he is going to be. He was born into my care but he is his own person.Same thing when i discovered that he was vegetarian...literally refused to eat any meat of any sort anytime anywhere...even with promises of toys etc..bribing only works on the weak willed...i was forced to research how to get him protein without meat and did so until such a time as he began to eat meat. My point is that he was  and  at the time and had only been exposed to my eating habits. He made up his mind that he didnt like something...but at all...and that was that.In the case of religious beliefs in an adult relationship i have firm beliefs of my own and would have to consider including them in any negociations if my beliefs were at odds with his to the extent that he may try to infringe on mine...conversion attending a church of a religion that preaches hatred or rigid ideals...that sort of thing. What i tolerate for my son and what i submit to in a relationship are two different things....either way it kinda looks like im gettin dommed from all angles. ,BDSMtalk,chniv1n,2,t5_31ep5
1064303,0,t3_26auwc,For me as I try to work up my pain threshold I find working up in slow bits help. As in each time add a little more. As said pleasure helps a lot too. Feeling good makes it easier to handle more pain sometimes even rubbing the butt in between the beating to more graphic touching.,BDSMtalk,chp9kt6,2,t5_31ep5
1072701,0,t3_26ecmx,Not quality ones anyway.  There are sex shops.  And there are alternative clothing stores but for good quality gear it pretty much sucks.

1081213,0,t3_26hrz4,Im not fond of heels for play either unless they are boots with a good wide heel then the height doesnt seem to matter so much.  I enjoy a bondage table too but find that will still only work up to a certain level of impact. We enjoy play where he will come down hard on my back with both hands. If I am standing for it its like a huge powerful shove that knocks my breath away. If I am lying on something solid like the table it is crushing in a bad way. Also very heavy impact on my hips while lying has caused my hip to dislocate previously. I dont really understand the mechanisms of it all but it seems that standing and even offering opposing resistance keeps it all firmly in place.,BDSMtalk,chr6qet,2,t5_31ep5
1116667,0,t3_26wuro,Here is my very personal definaiton of humilation  for me humilation is standing in front of the one who owns me completely naked. Not talking about clothes here they are irrelevent although sometimes they are what is used. I am talking about being spiritually naked in front of him. Having him see all of me my deepest darkest nastiest side and say Yes I love you still.  This is why for me the epitome of humilation is the mildest thing to lie in his arms and confess some of my deepest darkest truly nasty fantasies to him. To have him hear how dirty my fantasies get and accpet me still.  Other things that do it for me do include the nudity that was described here. Now I am very much a nudist and very comfortable being nude. But only when the social situation makes being nude feel apporprate or empowering to me. Getting naked before anyone else does  or opening the door to fully dressed guests while Im nude  can be powerfully humilating to me. In fact so can simply wearing clothes that seem to me to be inappoprate to the given situation. For instance I always keep light floating robelike clothes in the toy bag when we go somewhere to play to put on after we play. Silks. but suggest I wear them INTO the party or dungeon and you will get a look of sheer horror from me.  Humilation  what humilates YOU does not always make sense.,BDSMtalk,chv83ro,2,t5_31ep5
1268943,0,t3_28mp2u,With a PhD in Human Sexuality it is rare to be shocked by what people do sexually but what is often a shock to us is how judgemental some folks in the bdsm world are about what it is others need or want. Wed of  thought that since what almost all of us need is rejected by main stream society and we know how it feels to be outcast that wed be more tolerant of the others on this and other sites.... but it seems that isnt the case all the time.,BDSMtalk,cicdfbn,1,t5_31ep5

1294140,0,t3_28wrhl,I dont have an online relationship. I am not one to be micromanaged either. But people do as they wish and not for me to judge the type of relationship you have.  Sir in the beginning had me do certain projects that needed to be completed in the areas of his choice not me to control. This was my work hours specific house tasks how to respond when he email me and a list of bills coming in and bills paid.  Since he is an astrologer he wanted me to learn the basics so there was homework.,BDSMtalk,cif7hb9,2,t5_31ep5
1294208,0,t3_28wrhl,I see may people here completely ridiculing the concept of an online Ds relationship.  This tells me two things about those people either they have never tried it and so they are talking about something they have absolutely no experience with or they have tried it and failed so now they are using the sour grapes tactic to soothe their bruised egos.  I say simply this  Any collar is only as good as the relationship it represents either online or RT.  One is no better or worse than the other they are simply different. I can adapt to new circumstances and make them work for me.  If you cannot adapt to the new medium of the virtual world that is your misfortune not mine. Just because you cannot does not mean it cant be done.  I have both a RT livein slave and two more parttime online slaves and in all cases they are rewarding relationships.  They are different of course but that does not make them invalid.  As to the creation of rules for those online try to keep in mind that rules ought to serve a purpose.  Arbitrary rules will never stick well.  Make your rules slowly and build them as submission deepens and you see the need.  Do not confuse them with rituals which are a different but equally valuable thing and often far more fun.  Rules and protocols should reinforce discipline.  That is they should help to create and maintain an atmosphere conducive to both learning and obedience without impinging on others doing the same.  Good luck to you and yours.,BDSMtalk,cif7r82,2,t5_31ep5

1472446,0,t3_2b1idx,I think it has a place in the conversation but it ought to be taken with the same grain of salt as a guy playing space invaders at the arcade and telling the kid playing Guitar hero that he is useless and that video games arent what they once were.  Yes time does tend to mean you have experience but where I have seeen once you pass a point say oh  or  years.  Especially as a dom your experiences are repeats or outright the same.  There are people around who have been in the lifestyle  years and there is respect to be given with that but at the same time I wouldnt give my grandfather who fought in WWII the controls to a sidewinder missile when he has spent the last  years enjoying his M.  As far as Im concerned  years of experience in MOST cases not all is simply the same year of experience over and over.  There are exceptions but theres something to be said for mixing youthful novelty and some new ideas and maybe time finds a way to do it better that youre not wild about that doesnt make it any less better. ,BDSMtalk,cj0uh1z,2,t5_31ep5

1782519,0,t3_2exetr,I think first that each lady must define what it is she really wants. Rape is not about sex its about violence. Rape is a person using sex as a violent weapon against another person. The result isnt about pleasure but violence.  In my experience no Im not talking for anyone other than those I know women have fantasies of being taken.  There is a difference to me a big difference. When I take a lady its not for the purpose of violence. I take because I desire her body and mind. I want her to not just submit to me but to want it and need it as bad as I do.  Just my take on the situation.,BDSMtalk,ck3u9tj,5,t5_31ep5
1868246,0,t3_2g00jj,I think we also sometimes may be prone to seeing things as a lack of selfcontrol when the truth is that theyre actually habits we dont like.  If your dominant isnt an alcoholic but is going out and getting drunk with his friends every Saturday thats not a matter of selfcontrol.  Thats the fact he likes getting drunk with his friends and you wish he didnt.  Dominant spent  quid buying Star Wars figures on Ebay?  Not selfcontrol.  Hes a geek.  And when youre not around he makes them have battles with each other and does funny little ewok voices.  Just thought youd like to know.,BDSMtalk,ckebfip,2,t5_31ep5

3500470,0,t3_30ast5,Mef and my MasterM seem to have a love for dynamic and dominance and submission specifically in both our sex life and mundane life. I am mostly service oriented in everyday life. I.e dishes bring him dinner fold laundry clean the bathroom seemingly normal things except they are expected of me at this point. He will give me orders to get him things or even to give me some grounding from stress by having me kneel at his feet while he is at the computer. Punishments are just that things I dont like. Mostly he takes things away for going against his wishes or not paying attention and doing not as he says almost always in non sexual things. Actually a lot of out Ms relationship is non sexual. Dont get me wrong we are sexual people and our bedroom activity is not vanilla per say thought Master like to use his body weight to restrain instead of cuffs and rope or spank with his hand before he will go get a paddle. So we like a very natural take on it I guess. Anyway punishment is like I get the wrong milk after he tells be what kind to get three times I then get my phone taken away for the rest of the night. Not fun. Rewards are paddling or candy or anything that makes me feel his love. Kneeling is used as both a reward and punishment. Of he lets me sit on my hip with my legs tucked under its a reward if I cant and have to sit on my feet with my hands on my legs its punishment since my feet fall asleep.

3558464,0,t3_312g0p,First I get the feeling that youre talking meeting people in RL not online  when do they show you that theyre kinky and what their orientation is? I typically show my interest in a woman and ask them out.  Before that first date and during I watch her to see how she relates to me.  If things go well I will show initiative in a vanilla way. If things proceed to the bedroom I will do some gentle taking charge maybe swat her ass a few times.  I also simply say that I like to take charge in bed. I suppose my answer is that I proceed with the relationship first and introduce the kink later on.,BDSMtalk,cpxw1d3,2,t5_31ep5

That was awesome. We did actually talk again the other day about getting into ropes and Im pretty sure I told him three to four times that before he ever ties me up we need to sit down and talk about safety.
