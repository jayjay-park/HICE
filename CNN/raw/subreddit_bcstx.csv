Im  lived here most of my life have only twostepped twice have only gone to one college football game seen tons of rock shows and dont have to ever listen to country music.   Of note living expenses here are great the people are great and you are only about . hours away from Houston Austin... great day trips and just a few hours away from Dallas and San Antoniowhich are great weekend trips.   If you like the outdoors hiking camping biking and water are all around us. Its a nice place to hang out and relax.  ,bcstx,cmqjxpq,4,t5_2s3gc
