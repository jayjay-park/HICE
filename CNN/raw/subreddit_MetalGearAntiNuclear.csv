7148814,0,t1_d1qo9wm,Yeah the main reasons Im not interested in ranking up are     .  I get bothered by highlevel hackers more when my level is higher.     .  I have more flexibility in my targets and still regularly get nuke targets across all levels when my rank is lower.     Supposedly if you level down it makes it easier to find people with nukes but I dont really believe it.  Im ranked ish on PC and try to keep it around there for the aforementioned reasons.,MetalGearAntiNuclear,d1qqwop,1,t5_3csvp

7242978,0,t1_d20omhc,i feel as though knowing of people who hold nukes would be confusing to me but otherwise the rest seems to be fine i think knowing of allies would be easier as id be developing a sort of relationship with them.ill take the position at the very least i can hold us over but maybe ill even like it. tell me what to do and ill do it.,MetalGearAntiNuclear,d21h2pn,1,t5_3csvp

8778485,0,t1_d72ypaj,exactly the game is unbalanced against us so any kind of exploit must be used man we have to defend nukes we dont own if we mess up an invasion the hoarder gets a free week to create other nukes the nuke tab is broken but i have a suspect that this tactic cant be applied because the security challenge panel is empty since my ps expired and since also nuke hoarders have IMMEDIATE alert i hope the ps absence doesnt preclude me also to see the nuke tab content... but i see hoarders on random tab that are being already invaded and indirect retaliations already invaded and blockaded so i think im just being unlucky i need confirmation if we can steal nukes without ps thats really a weapon we can use...,MetalGearAntiNuclear,d72zab4,1,t5_3csvp
