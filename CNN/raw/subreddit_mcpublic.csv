1505670,0,t1_cj4xnla,Ultimately I feel that villagers do hurt the economy and the game itself in their current state. . will make villagers a lot easier to farm but with less rewards due to lack of dia gear. P got along just fine before villagers that gave diamond gear for practically free after some initial tedium.I disagree that people are over protective of their diamonds. Ive mostly mined diamonds for use in trading with others this rev in particular with buying bulk redstone from other people. I think the problem with our economy is isnt so much that people dont want to buysell things its that setting up trades with other peoplegoing into tradespamming chat with what youre buyingselling and waiting for a deal if anyone even bothers to give one is too much of a hassle to the point where its usually easier to get the things you want yourself.

It looks like a regular PvP arena with three levels designed to make players move around and try to find a better angle on their opponents. Players would have a bow arrows food and some colored leather armor. The arena would be good for  or  teams each with  to maybe  players. The surrounding stands are designed for easy viewing of the game.Anyway I like your idea too! I love PvP with bows and I think it would be great to have a FIPA tournament. Since Rev will probably be short maybe we can focus on trying out many styles of archery PvP arenas then in Rev decide what works best.Im just throwing ideas out there. But count me in!

Sounds like pretty standard server drama with staff etc but on a much larger scale. Check out the player stats for only PvE Rev  our current revision. Youll see  players have played over  hours this rev alone and  have played for at least  hours. Thats a lot of players. As with any group of people that large youll find there are many issues and each issue will cause someone to be unhappy and some small number of those will be so unhappy that theyll be very vocal about their unhappiness. So yes there can be drama.

6538557,0,t3_4563go,If you want to come to Metal Mountains weve got a really killer setup. Its ALMOST completely auto with only one goof left to iron out. Basically you can AFK there and just wait for shitloads of villagers to breed endlessly. I can walk you through the building the redstone which is very simple and the hows and whys if you want.Our setup is basically a heavily modified version of this Warning If you build what you see in the video youre gonna have a bad time.

6544422,0,t1_czw59io,Heres what happened let me know what you think He was added as a member of Brom. We suggested he read our subreddit and MrLoud offered to explain our theme but he said he needed to build a house first. Brom doesnt have a citywide region yet but he obviously picked a location he knew was in Brom. After he built the house but before the region was made iirc I took him to our museum server managed by williamck and explained our interconnected collaborative theme. I explained that were building a dense multilayered city and that everyone can connect to and slightly modify anyone elses build to make everything interconnected. He seemed a bit overwhelmed by the idea but wasnt against it. He had the region created about two weeks ago and hasnt been online since so we havent been able to talk to him. We can live with that house there but wed like to build roads and modify the area and preferably even make a few tweaks to it. We cant because of the region.,mcpublic,czw8voc,3,t5_2s52h

6872301,0,t3_49vg3g,I think its important to differentiate between Stations and Systems. Below are some that I know ofremember.For systems there are really only a small handful CARBON lite  the smart rail system redstone and magical. The spiritual successor to the CARBON system but doesnt really use any of the older redstone designs anymore. CARTS  Typical name for all point to point rail stations. Basically becomes an ad hoc rail network. Named after a particular station design but usually now refers to all point to point stations. TRAVEL  Narississ project this revRetired Systems DEEPS  A rev  personal project by I forget who stellar?Skiflea Basically was a hub design with hub stations at bedrock level. noRTh  Narississ rev  project know for its beauty. WHEAT  A rev  system.For the stations there are CARTS  A bank of memory cells and lights to control cart routing to a unique track per destination. DDOS  My design when item frames redstone mechanic was introduced. Designed to be a very simple station. Half the CARTS stations Ive seen this rev are actually DDOSes . The post I introduced it in CARBON lite  the station design used for CARBON stations. Transmits a binary signal alongside the rider. Designed by drtmv.  the size of the mini CARBON station I designed for rev  which in turn was  the size of the original CARBON stations. TRAVEL  Narississ stations. So pretty. Double Dial  My unique one off this rev for Solaces  button CARTS station. Encodes your destination into two analog memory cells which drive two track selectors which function almost identically to DDOS.CARTSDDOSDouble Dial and most other one off designs all are part of the same CARTS system of dumb point to point rails. CARBON is the biggest separate rail system. And Narississ projects are their own stand alone things.,mcpublic,d0vacnv,8,t5_2s52h

7874537,0,t3_4n69yv,gtIs midrev a good time to join?The rev is pretty new still. Only about  weeks in. PLENTY of time.gt It looks like this server uses mods. I havent played Minecraft in a while are mods easier to install now?We dont use any mods. You can join with a vanilla client. In general mods are a bit easier to install though compared to stuff like beta. We have plugins which are purely serverside and exist to either aid in moderating for our staff or little things here and there meant to spice up gameplay.gtThe rules Ive read so far look slightly confusingstrict. Is this somewhere where I can have a semi casual experience?Yes. Were pretty chill around here and youll only get banned if you either cheatxrayflyhaxetc grief builds or are an assholeno homophobiasexismetc. Pretty basic stuff to maintain a healthy environment. If you have any questions or need help a lot of people are quick to provide assistance. Were one of the oldest servers around so weve had to adapt our rules a lot over the years because people continually find loopholes but for the most part you wont need to care about a lot of them if youre a decent person.gtHow do I join?Info is in the sidebar. Just plug in p or c or pvp followed by .nerd.nu into the address bar of multiplayer. We dont have any application process.,mcpublic,d4165eg,4,t5_2s52h
