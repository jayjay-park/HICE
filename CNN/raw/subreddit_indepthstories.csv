The article specifically says that it is the extreme poverty which is driving radicalization. Instead of sending weapons how about reducing poverty? How about we start that process at home?

5568071,0,t1_cwn5zry,gt You breathe air you eat food you drink water you talk to people every day. Those are not addictions.Correct. Allow me to refer you to Maslows hierarchy of needs.Basically you need air more than you need companionship. If you are denied air you cant deal with anything else until you have air. Its a physiological need.If something starts to creep up that hierarchy of needs? Something that you didnt need when you were born? its an addiction.Do you need heroin more than you need social relationships? You may be addicted.Do you need methamphetamine more than you need your personal physical safety? Start looking into the idea that you may be addicted.gtYou seem obsessed that there has to be a problem.I had no idea that there was a problem. Except for people who are addicted. They have a problem.gta contented person who is not physically harming themselves is not an addict no matter how much of a substance they are using.What if they are harming someone else? What if they are harming themselves in ways that are not physical? What if they are ruining themselves financially? Socially?gtYou like to have the world sorted out into little neat and tidy boxes and hate to see things that dont fit in to the proper places? Does that sound like you?lol nope.gtI mean I hate to turn this into a personal analysis Do you though?gtbut I guess you were the one who started down that road werent you? I definitely wasnt. I havent written a word about you. but now that you bring it up I cant help but observe that you seem a bit defensive? Maybe when the smoke clears a little you should reread this conversation.

10813274,0,t1_ddvah6f,gt Hawaii can do what it wants. But it would mean the US moving bases...out of there.Well when you consider this was is and has been one of the chief demands for a return to sovereignty in the context of historical precedent this is kind of an obvious matter. Said another way yes it would mean this because this at the center of every discussion of Hawaiian sovereignty. The presence of American military forces is how Hawaii lost its sovereignty in the first place.That said theres almost zero chance this will happen now because the prevailing force again paying respect to history has been the Hawaiian monarchywhich no longer exists in a practical form. Technically Princess Abigail Kawananakoa is the last living decedent with a legitimate claim to the throne but I cant find any reference to what her exact position is on a restoration of said Monarchy.It will be a difficult transition for sure it would be a long and protracted transition at the same time but there are a few things to considergtI dont think they have the full amount of resources for long term support. Unfortunately youd be wrong.Hawaii especially Big Island has a lot of fertile farmland and places a heavy premium on being able to selfsustain. Kualoa Ranch where many Hollywood films were shot has livestock farms and ecological zones specifically designed to study and understand the harvesting of crops to help feed and sustain the island chain because of their distance from the mainland and the costs of bringing food over. This was started after WWII when local ecologists asked How long could we survive independently without resources from the mainland before we reach an unrecoverable state? and were terrified with the answer something like three months. Big Island is almost entirely farmland the state government protects farm animals livestock and produce as a means of offsetting the demands of importing food.  Wild chickens pigs and cows can be found all over. In fact there was a cemetary not far from where I was staying near the Punchbowl crater FULL of wild chickens and roosters just running around. Went to the beach another pocket of chickens. Went to Waikiki guess what? Yep. I saw chickens.Theyre now at a point thanks to state law and reforms able to almost entirely selfsustain their food supplies across the entire food pyramid.Also worth noting that economically Hawaii is actually quite insularyoull have a very hard time finding a big national bank like BBampT or Bank of America. While there are branch locations the number of locally owned banks and credit unions out number these large banks by about . The island chain also has six massive wind turbine farms with four more on the way and the existing plants have the capacity to generate all of the power needed for residents.I guess what Im trying to say is that the transition would be rocky but thats an unavoidable and inherent feature of transitioning away from the relationship Hawaii has had with the mainland over the last  years. It isnt however in my opinion having spent a month there something that is going to have as much of a negative outcome for residents as you may think. While tourism makes up a good chunk of their economy its community services banking healthcare legal services and the like that has the most potential to send the islands into the most immediate state of economic worry.If you ever have the funds I wholly recommend as many people as I can to go out there and spend a solid month or two living there among the people. Its an interesting world both from the gorgeous views and touristy things but also to understand the challenges of history and present. After a while itll start to feel pretty claustrophobic but youll learn a lot about Hawaii that gets missed among all the tourism stuff of going to the beach drinking in Honolulu  Waikiki. ,indepthstories,ddvba0m,1,t5_2r5ld
