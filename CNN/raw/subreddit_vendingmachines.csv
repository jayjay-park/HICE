Just test the voltage and get an appropriate LED or build a little circuit that will accommodate it.,vendingmachines,d3fnosj,2,t5_2s850
8319126,0,t1_d5h9spp,I would but I dont think thats the problem.  The lock is turned but it still wont open.  I dont know if theres an additional catch somewhere that Im not noticing but the lock is turned and it still wont open so Im thinking Im missing a step or something.  Drilling would be my last ditch effort because then I would have to get a new lock installed.,vendingmachines,d5hg3g4,2,t5_2s850
