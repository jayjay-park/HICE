Have some common sense dont leave them around at the festival keep them in closed or zippered pockets you should be ok. If your wallet gets stolen they usually just grab the cash and festival tokens and throw the rest away id plastic cards. So dont panic if you lose your passport for example you should be able to find stuff like that again at the lost and found office. Of course youd probably want to cancel your cards after that...,Hellfest,d8djxpf,1,t5_34j7v
