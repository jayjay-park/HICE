3486742,0,t3_306w5i,Saved BeskhaPretty much the same as everyone else. Besides i figured her and Asher would be a lot close than he is with Malcolm who i have been constantly clashing with so it made sense for Asha who i am just playing as a blood crazed psycho. I was disappointed I couldnt get Ashas tongue cut out somewhat would have been so bad ass if he was like I dont need my tongue to fight.Talked to Tyrion.I detest this version of Margeary. Besides it made no sense for Mira to back out after forging the letter etc. She is desperate.Killed the hell out of Britt.Made him suffer. My Gared cares very little for the nights watch and considers himself a Forrester above all else. The second he spotted Britt he decided to kill him and he was glad to get the opportunity to do so atop the wall. He is getting to the North Grove and helping house forrester at all costs.Stood up to GryffRodrik is too proud and furious to submit. besides he was punching people left and right today. All whitehills must die. Including Gwyn if i get the chance. I also chose to take out Gryff over saving Ryon. That is all that my Rodrik cares about right now.Kept the decreeAs i said Margeary can shove it. I hope Mira gets out of kings landing with her head on her shoulders but that decree was too important too burn. Especially after all the risk to get it.Im suspecting the maester. So i bet it is the mother.,TheGameOfThronesGame,cppppdl,7,t5_2z8j3

3571105,0,t3_309id9,This episode was so good. The first two episodes you try to be smart but by the third you almost dont care anymore you just want to fight back and thats when they REALLY start trying to tell you to be smart.

4099775,0,t1_crnlkwy,ampampamp Torture sfw gtTorture is the act of deliberately inflicting severe physical or psychological pain and possibly injury to an organism usually to one who is physically restrained or otherwise under the torturers control or custody and unable to defend against what is being done to him or her. Torture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals groups and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or even longer. Reasons for torture can include punishment revenge political reeducation deterrence interrogation or coercion of the victim or a third party or simply the sadistic gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture. The need to torture another is thought to be the result of internal psychological pressure in the psyche of the torturer. The torturer may or may not intend to kill or injure the victim but sometimes torture is deliberately fatal and can precede a murder or serve as a form of capital punishment In other cases the torturer may be indifferent to the condition of the victim. Alternatively some forms of torture are designed to inflict psychological pain or leave as little physical injury or evidence as possible while achieving the same psychological devastation. Depending on the aim even a form of torture that is intentionally fatal may be prolonged to allow the victim to suffer as long as possible such as halfhanginggtgtImage i  A variety of iconic torture instruments. Many including the large Iron Maiden of Nuremberg were in fact never used for torture.Interesting Chinese water torture | World Organisation Against Torture | Iron maiden torture device | Rack torture Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcrnllb oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecrnllb.

4608118,0,t3_3e408h,I actually misinterpreted the choice. I thought the person who stayed behind would stay back and live while the other went to fight. Geeeez that sucked I actually chose to rewind and leave Rodrik behind.Also I maimed Gryff in the last episode and he showed up on a horse with a new eye.  Wow.I just feel bad after this episode. Oh and Finn just died almost immediately. Didnt even get the option to burn his body real fast. Sigh.,TheGameOfThronesGame,ctbfqmc,12,t5_2z8j3
4763025,0,t3_3elgn4, Gared I personally think Gared will eventually die after reaching the North Grove. We dont know how it will help House Forrester we havent been given details about it but if it requires bringing something back to Ironrath then my prediction of Gareds death becomes stronger. The Boltons and The Whitehills want him dead for killing one or both those soldiers at the farm. The Nights Watch want him dead for what happened to Britt and for his desertion. Im afraid House Forresters lord would have to execute Gared for all these things if he returns. The only way I see him escaping his demise would be to go to Essos or something but I just cant picture him there. On the other hand TTG has already killed off Ethan and Asher  Rodrik. Will they kill off  playable characters? Plus I think there is going to be a choice between saving Cotter or Silvi from what I heard in Episode s unused audio files. Mira It seems that no matter what you do Tyrion always notices Cersei sent you and the guard drags you out of the cell. Will you Cersei help Mira if she successfully lies to her? Will someone like Sera or Tom help her depending if you told Garibald her secret and  or saved Tom by killing that Lannister guard Damien in Ep.? Maybe well find out if Tom is one of Varys little birds and maybe well become one as well setting her plot for a possible nd Season. Asher  Rodrik I dont think much will change based on who stayed behind just some dialogue options and reactions from NPCs like Lady Forrester Talia etc. Im thinking that Elaena may commit suicide if Rodrik dies especially if you kiss her in Ep. and  or sleep with her in Ep.. I was also pondering that maybe she will get pregnant if you sleep with her but that might open a story branch too big for TTG to handle. If Asher dies maybe Gwyn will be so upset with her father and brother that she will start betraying her House from the inside. I think any of the  would be able to lead the Pit Fighters but I doubt Beshka will stay with the Forresters with Asher dead. Maybe well kill Gryff at the end of the episode and fight Lord Whitehill in the next season.In the early episodes I was hoping for  different endings to this game Ending A House Forrester makes all or almost all the possible allies by marrying Elaena wether Asher manages to bring an army from Essos even though now we know he brings it no matter what Mira discovers Andros plan and successfully makes alliances but we now also know that the outcome is always the same etc. By making a substantial ammount of allies they manage to defeat the Whitehills with low casualties on their side. Ending B House Forrester makes few allies but just enough to defeat the Whitehills with huge casualties however. Ending C House Forrester isnt able to make the right alliances and is crushed and extinct by the Whitehills.This  different endings idea would be cool however if they are planning a nd Season with the Forresters as the protagonists it would be impossible.,TheGameOfThronesGame,ctux9rf,1,t5_2z8j3
