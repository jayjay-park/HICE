11270114,0,t3_60tmqs,If anything the solo near the middle is more reminiscent of Symphony X. I believe off the Odyssey. I forget what the song was... it was an opening track.,mastodonband,df9g8lr,2,t5_2wq7t

11460538,0,t1_dfqp17x,For me Between the Buried and Me is similar in a few ways rabidly loyal fanbase but it took me forever to actually get into them deep intricate music that allows you to digest an album for months if not years  good mixture of heavy and lightWith BTBAM the heavy is really heavy and the light is pretty light at times. Their music is a bit more progressive and erratic.  It definitely takes some listening to understand what theyre doing. There are other bands I really like that I classify as being as good as Mastodon but in different ways. Coheed Protest the Hero Gojira Persefone Caligulas Horse.  Based on your list there I would recommend Thank You Scientist as well. Animals as Leaders if you like extremely guitar driven djent type music. I can give you songs to check out for any or all of these bands if you are interested,mastodonband,dfv1m6y,1,t5_2wq7t
11465206,0,t3_63icci,It really is heavy on the lows which is a good and bad thing. Sounds very heavy but I feel like its missing a lot of the details such as the bells and chimes. Only heard the first side the other day Ill give it a full listen soon. ,mastodonband,dfvkoov,3,t5_2wq7t

11467684,0,t1_dfvsv00,I envy you so much. Seriously that was an album that just got better with each listen. The last Baron is easily my favorite song of theirs. ,mastodonband,dfvutcp,1,t5_2wq7t
