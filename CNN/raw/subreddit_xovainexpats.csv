9005877,0,t3_53jgin,Hm I dont really use liquid liners very often so I dont have any personal experiences but I heard a lot about the Kpalette ones which is a Japanese brand. They should be on Amazon if youre in the US! Pretty affordable but I believe shipping charges would add up. The other one I can think of is Clio a Korean brand and this is a brush tip not a felt tip so it could be less prone to drying up and disintegrating. ,xovainexpats,d7ud6jk,2,t5_3g75l
9052817,0,t3_53zzbl,Late LOTW I had a go with the LOral La Palette . The palette is all Nude Ros shades and even though its a bit muddy Im happy with how it turned out  I also think I did a pretty good job of concealing the stupid massive pimple that popped up right in the middle of my forehead this morning!,xovainexpats,d8005rt,2,t5_3g75l
