659263,0,t3_21ou6g,Quite simply plan for alternatives and if theyre absolutely ridiculous make it so they have the option but its a losing proposition. Quest NPC and they attack it? Oh guess what they have strong armor and also  mercenary guards. Give them some freedom but make it clear that some actions are not gonna end well for them.Never railroad them always make sure to give them options but dont let them get away with killing quest NPCs unpunished. Make them lose body parts or something! If that doesnt work put them in a fight where someone is gonna have to die that should discourage them from trying it again.,masseffectd20,cgf7hqn,1,t5_311t4
