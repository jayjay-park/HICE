3226162,0,t3_2x2tv8, one way I know how to get Kamehameha Go to the Parallel Quests area and when youre looking at the list of quests press Right on your left stick or dpad. Doing so will bring up a list of the possible rewards you can obtain from the quest! I havent check in the clothes thing I read on a forum somewhere you can have a mentor but then replace him with another but still have your progress saved with the previous mentor. For example have Krillin as a mentor and do quests for him then choose to be trained under Yamcha for a while and do some work with him you can then go back to Krillin and pick back up right where you left off!Hope this helps!,dbxv,cowe9l2,1,t5_36228

3305350,0,t1_cp4nrsg,It does more damage than an Ultimate that you cant hit with  of the time in PvP. PvE maybe more chances but even then the NPCs block most of it usually. If not sure it does more damage. And you not considering it an Ultimate is your own personal opinion.And my friend you didnt understand what I meant. A few hits in  you can fire off an JC  youve just got hit by an Ultimate at point blank range. I thought I got my point across. Anyone doing JC the first thing they do when they get close to you is a dumb dumb cause Id say  of the time any NPC or other player will block it. Its meant to be combod into and out of. And that is what makes it a good Ultimate. Everyone just seems to be so hung up on the sheer damage of attacks and not considering the crazy utilities and combo possibilities some supers and ultimates give. Sure you can argue a Super Kamehameha does more damage than something else but in the long run if you cant even hit anyone with a brain with the damn attack the other option will do more damage.,dbxv,cp51bah,1,t5_36228

Its easily the best DB game Ive ever played.The game has tons and tons of replayability which is really what a videogame needs when you want it to be your daily driver. You can make your own character it has an interesting whatif scenario story mode you can do grind pve missions with friends for super attacks or clothing and you can do pvp solo or with friends or you can walk around TokiToki and see other players. If your a fan of DB I have no doubt you would find this game worth the .I paid the full  for the game and after  or  days of playing I purchased the season pass because Dimps really did a great job with the game and I want them to not only develop it further but possibly make a sequel. For you I really believe you would like the game but sadly the PS is a dying console. Depending on how long it would take you to save up the rest of the money I would recommend putting the fifty bucks towards a PS in the future. If thats at all not an option then I still highly recommend the game but I cant say exactly how the experience is on PS because I have no idea how many play it online.,dbxv,cpmlz7y,1,t5_36228

Literally less skill required than spamming Invincible Ultimate ZSoul builds. I think its important how generic this build is really goes to show that Male Earthlings are absolutely IMBA In all honesty Id rather fight these guys over any other build here. Fun build to use to master back attacks.

4703191,0,t1_ctk35pa,Yo Dimps! You know how when you create a Saiyan youre playing as a race of extinct warriors that apparently could challenge gods? Yeah and you know how your Saiyan CaC finds out that Frieza destroyed their entire race? Yeah can you actually like you know do something with that on the sequel? Jokes aside they need to make CaCs more involved in the story. In Xenoverse  your character is only there to beat the bad guy and then go on to the next stage to beat the next bad guy. They dont develop they barely interact with others they dont speak which is fine actually and you just never feel an actual connection with the character you created. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. Whatever story Xenoverse  is going to have they need to heavily increase the development and involvement of your character in the story. Dont just have them do things because theyre told to let them question what theyre doing let them interact with other characters even if it goes against the timelinefixing business let them form relationships with the people fighting alongside them let them react to their own speciesrelated events Saiyans getting angry at Frieza Majins wanting to learn more about Buu Frieza Clansmen finding out more about their race etc..,dbxv,ctndhxy,1,t5_36228

But is it worth to just take both?EDIT After messing around a bit I think I pefer K so that being hit doesnt reduce my kaioken duration.

Never mind the countless games where the only part of the Ginyu Force we usually got were Ginyu and Recoome. And Satan is not at all more popular than Frieza. Not even close. Hes only comical relief in the games but nobody at all ever uses him in a serious match.

9429186,0,t1_d9b5jjf,Im lvl  now with my Namekian and I got giant form after doing at least  defense missions for Guru. Your level range has to be at least lvl. I got mine at  and I beat story up til the Android saga. The krillin ability he is talking about is a Ki move called Rise to Action which restores  stamina    bars I think  for  ki bar. You get it in the very first Krillin master training. So far stats wise I dumped all my points into Battacks I use Kaoiken also for this build and put the rest in stamina. Ideally if you want to optimize purely for Giant form go all stamina then put points into BAttacks as a secondary and have at least  points in health. Since I use Kaioken I decided to go HPKi for my build. The namekian health regen also kicks in sooner the higher your health is as the threshold scales with max health.Putting points into StrikeSuper or Ki Super is kind of a waste I believe since you wont have enough points to make a difference and you wont be doing abilities while in Giant form. Plus in order to make them more useful you would also have to put points into Ki which would slow the build down. ,dbxv,d9b7pmq,3,t5_36228

Expert missions online are seriously glitched i.e its very hard to return the super bomb attack in missions like mission . Offline surprisingly the ai easily repels the bomb which makes it more easier to play offline.Finally mission  is a whole different dimension of pain as compared to other missions. You gotta fight dark broly then dark omega shenron then dark frieza and then dark janemba. Dark broly is shit although thats cuz i played this mission a lot. Dark omega shenron dark frieza dark janemba have this weird blue spiky attack which will hit all members of the team and has to be evaded then. A lot of people die due to this. Also janemba sends you to another dimension towards the end.And if you think this is the end then you are in for a big surprise cuz dark mira comes at the end and fucks your case again with the blue spiky attack.

They are ALL I see in high level ranked matches. If I fought tien krillin zarbon dodoria or any underdog character with equal stats to mine and I lost Ill be the first to admit that theyre better than me.

I used to think it was pointless to play ranked without limits unless i wanted to cheese like everyone else but now im almost to tp and the only cheesy thing i do is wear my opponents stamina down with the rockpaperscissors mindset and catch them in a stamina break at the end of a combo when they cant zvanish. But to me that isnt cheese. I outplayed my opponent to set them up for maximum damage.I understand the frustration of getting caught in a GODA chain or gogo gum ult but honestly enough practice makes those strategies worthless.

9793486,0,t3_5ff1lj,Sounds like you got paired with a bunch of people who are really good at working your stamina. Personally Ive initiated every fight at the tournament by burst rushing them. If they block it then I know I need to play more defensively against them. If they get hit I vanish and initiate a vanish combo. That is intended to bait them into panic vanishing away from the combo after which I back attack them and just work them over. These people I can just wale on.That all takes place in the first  seconds of the match and I can pretty accurately determine exactly how my opponent will react for the rest of the match from those three seconds.As for the damage issues youre having Ive noticed occasional latency issues that will prevent ki blasts from connecting properly.

Equip GoGo Gum and Dragon Flash Bullet. Bind him with the Gum and use DBF up close and go for a grab whenever you can. I did this exclusively and had my  points in just over an hour.Also the Broly SuperSoul will ensure you begin the fight with max ki use this along with maximum charge and you should be able to block all damage with Super Guard.For Supers I would bring GoGoGum Dragon Flash Bullet Super Guard and Maximum Charge.Ultimates dont really matter so as long as you bring a beam type ultimate for KiClashes youll be fine.

Not optimized but it works fine for me.Step   Raid starts.  I use that super soul since it lets you avoid the charge up at the start of the round and just go right into SSJ for that sweet defense boost and to have enough Ki ready to start throwing out Gum.   Bind the raid boss with Go Go Gum  will take a few tries but try a  hit basic combo and then use the gum or do it while someone else is attacking him.  Step  Innocence Bullet poisons them after a Go Go Gum or just thrown out there.  Once you poison him get away quick easier to do if you poison them while gummed so you can get away for a second then prepare for the shitstorm.  Step   When the blue orbs of fuck youMarbling Drop gets used use Vanisher Guard evasive or Super Guard Super attack.  By the time they finish theyll either use their giant Ki blast so stop them or use that big shockwave that sends you to other arenas.  Thats fine.Step  that everyone forgets  After you poison him YOU HAVE TO THROW HIM TO GET THE DAMAGE DONE.  If you just poison him and then do nothing youll get no points for it.  I dont know why.  Just wait a bit then throw him easy to do while everyone else is juggling them.Step   Just do more damage.  Go Go Gum binds them and lets you land Dragon Flash BulletFlash BomberUlts for big damage.Step   Be a pal use Energy Zone available in the Skill Shop when you revive someone.  Use it right as they get up and go into that  second panting animation where they cant move it heals them even then.,dbxv,dau23ly,1,t5_36228

10766726,0,t3_5tybem,Idk if I can help on the PVE department as I dont know whats often effective but I surely can for PvP.Namekians cant pull off aerial stamina break combos so Meteor Strike is imperative Meteor Blow works well as a replacement if you like the looks better. what youll aim to do is use them when the opponent is below  bars and use a break instead of the followup to the attack. Itll land Namekians true strength is being hard to kill with their racial regen so many souls can be used to complement that. You can make a Hmm hmm hmm! build with Potential Unlocked and Do or Die which you can refresh indefinitely and is very annoying.You must die by my hand! and Dont quit! Get up! work particularly well with namekians since you can regen after the revival. So you can pick your poison on what you want strikeki.Namekians are great basic attackers they work well with both ki and strike but their combos are what really shines as theyre very damaging. There are about  namekian combos that can be achieved through a miriad of different inputs mind you that send the enemy downwards plus the own follow up to meteor strike this syncs particularly well with the Bomb Ki Blast since after you send them downwards you can throw a bomb ki blast immediately charging it DURING the combo so youll release right after and quickly extend your combos since your reach is pretty great.If having Bomb Ki Blasts isnt an option Gorgeous Shot is a good alternative. Even if youre not a blaster mind you. Its the juggle state that it gives that were looking for. Besides using it after a downward combo you can do it after people come rushing you or right after they vanish and go for an attack.Giant form is tough to use but surprisingly effective if youre good about picking your movement and attack during it you do however need to build solely around it for  stamina bars. A power biased transformation works wonders with it since you wont be needing to guard or to move fast.Flash strike is another very basal skill that works particularly well for namekians you can easily make a namekian striker or blaster work as long as you have high enough basics and an understanding of their combos  what you can link with it.I suggest you experiment a bit and take advantage of their range and basic strength.btw I realized now youd probably want a more already done build so I dont know if I can exactly help with that because a lot of it boils down to playstyle and what do you want to focus on,dbxv,ddqiasp,2,t5_36228

11124481,0,t1_desut4e,Odds are it wasnt in house. Theres a lot of overlap in game CG and film CG. But they do still have different skillsets and few developers would justify spending the months needed to create those two cutscenes when they could have specialists do it instead. ,dbxv,desy8e1,2,t5_36228

11776865,0,t1_dgux6r6,Come on man its not that drammatic. I take it people complain about mechanics when they play PVP but good thing I do not care or participate in it. This leaves me enjoying my time with the game by playing PQs leveling characters getting all the abilites trying them out and searching how to combo them in training and comparing damage of different abilities. This games main focus is not about balanced PVP. I would actually go as far as saying that PVP itself is not the primary focus for this game as well even though it can be a large part of it and you can get a lot out of it.Please forgive me if I am wrong in my assumption about the mechanic complaining related to PVP.,dbxv,dguy124,7,t5_36228
