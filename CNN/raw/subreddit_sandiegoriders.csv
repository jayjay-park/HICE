1933341,0,t3_2gs65t,As far as North County goes Highland Valley road to Ramona to Santa Ysabel stop for pie up to Palomar south grade and down the east grade and back will soak up an afternoon. Alternatively keep going from Santa Ysabel to Julian. Theres plenty of good riding out in East county too if youre closer to downtown or you can cruise up the coast for a nice little scenic tour of the beaches.,sandiegoriders,ckm5jya,2,t5_2sj5u
