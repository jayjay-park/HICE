1465743,0,t1_cizzzrl,I did a few months ago full on bangs for the first time in my life. It looked fantastic but my hair grows so fast I had to trim it every week because it would poke me in the eyes. Ive been considering getting it back again though. Another good thing about that style is that I dont have to be as fussy with my eyebrows because you cant see them.That sounds great Ive always liked those vintage styles!,GetFeminine,cj008ur,2,t5_32a84

2266530,0,t3_2h0rad,This is definitely not for everybody but I found two ways of managing my spending on small things. is to carry around a notebook and write down all your purchases. I find keeping track of it all helps me look at where Im being wasteful but also if Im debating buying that lipgloss or latte Ill go Ugh I dont want to bother writing this down so I dont buy it. is a bit easier its simply deciding how much spending money youll have this week withdrawing that much cash on a Monday morning and not using your cards throughout the week. You can keep an eye on how much money you have left and know that when its gone its gone no more than  ATM trip per week.Good luck!,GetFeminine,clrv2qz,1,t5_32a84

Im slightly modifying this two week clean eating challenge to try to get my eating back on track so tonight I made lettuce wrapped turkey burgers and sweet potato fries.  And because I have the self control of a giant I managed to make my boyfriend this cornbread without eating a single bit.Related does anyone have any tips to get your sweet potato fries extra crispy?  ,GetFeminine,cr3br0s,3,t5_32a84
