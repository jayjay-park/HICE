3060608,0,t3_2v79g2,I dont have much experience with Boxing but I dont think that it is so very effective any more. About Pallidium  you use the Auto Resource Collecter gear that you place within the pet. I wouldnt suggest being AFK whilst collecting because people can easily kill you. If you do decide to be AFK stay out of the blue mist because that uncloaks your ship you should definitely be cloaked if AFK.                                I would suggest you use the pet and collect with your ship as well. ,darkorbit,cof897w,1,t5_2t5jd
