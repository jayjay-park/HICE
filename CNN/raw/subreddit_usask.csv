4406984,0,t1_csm1nqm,These days its pretty much an unwritten rule you need a  year honors degree for a professor to take you on as a masters student and you need a masters degree to get most jobs in science. As far as Im aware due to the changes in medicine the  year degree is being discontinued in most if not all biomedical science programs because it isnt good for anything anymore and is outdated.,usask,csmegvi,2,t5_2spei
7340179,0,t1_d2cidp6,But the prof mentioned that this is the first time he has ever had to do this in over  years. So wouldnt that just credit that this time through the class was with students who worked harder for their marks than in the past? Seeing as the class was harder for past years and that this year it just happened to have a larger proportion of students who studied harder.Edit More Such as how people are increasingly dying at an older age. So students are getting smarter because they are working harder trying to find an analogy lol. So why cant the norm or acceptable average increase as well?,usask,d2cj15c,2,t5_2spei
