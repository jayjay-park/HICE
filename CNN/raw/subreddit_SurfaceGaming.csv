8045114,0,t3_4o2fnf,Ive been writing a thesis so havent come back here yet but I have an update I bought the game and gave it a try anyway. Runs between  and  FPS on low at p with  render resolution.But seems playable enough very fun game and on the small screen its not as bad as I feared. Sniping is a pain though though part of that might be the Australian internet too.But I cant see this getting above FPS without some drastic cut to the resolution but thats life I guess.,SurfaceGaming,d4kci7d,1,t5_2ugcu

8884631,0,t3_50k9uu,Super super quick test while at work... I actually have the Surface Book i dGPU GB. I ran it on the Intel  graphics but still that extra RAM probably helped a little. I also had the Surface Dock attached really Im shit at testing arent I.Anway ran at x on medium settings. FPS was in the s and s but very playable. Lowering resolution or quality settings would completely fix that Im sure. Some input lag but it was more irritating than anything. I had Vsync enabled so turning that off could help.,SurfaceGaming,d7ft2ls,1,t5_2ugcu

9060899,0,t3_54bw7b,SNES and GBA run fine on my Surface  GB so they should also run fine on the SP i. I have not tried PSX or PSP emulators though I think they should also run no problem.,SurfaceGaming,d80z34m,1,t5_2ugcu

10996223,0,t1_dee5rc3,I mean I noticed you said you also wanted it for taking notes. The only time I use paper is when I have something to turn in. And college is so much easier the less you have to carry.,SurfaceGaming,deedzcm,1,t5_2ugcu
