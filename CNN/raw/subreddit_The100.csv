Honestly I thought he was more of total dickdouche at first but I would also have been extremely upset that they would hang him for a crime he didnt commit and yet spare a little girl for a murder she made just because she was a little girl. I was actually siding more for Murphy in the episode he got banished of Bellamy because he let his relationship and bias for the little girl get in the way. I thought it was extreme yet understandable that he would kill the people who contributed in trying to lynch him but when he took Jasper as a hostage from witnessing the crime is where I draw the line.

I still know places in the West that are against interracial relationships  its all cosmopolitan in the cities but go out into the rural areas and youll find racism and homophobia alive and well. I remember a friend dating a black guy when I was in my teens so about  years ago and she got called n lover in the pub regularly.

His sorry to Jasper is imo more of him saying that Maya was a casualty of war and that if it was a better scenario hed wished Maya couldve survived too but it wasnt and she didnt. He did what he did because he knew it was the only choice they had at the time knowing that innocent people were going to die because of him and did it anyway. His reprogramming of the scrubbers was equal to if not more work than what Clarke and Bellamy did in pulling the lever. He made the hard choice but he wasnt going to do it alone which is why he shared it with Clarke and Bellamy.

3448018,0,t1_cpl9my0,Clarke is only scary because she committed neartotal genocide and burned a most of a Grounder army alive. They found peace in an alliance after the death of Finn keep in mind that Lexa saved Clarkes life because the Grounders wanted Clarkes blood for taking away their torturemurder ritual which was putting blood must have blood aside in order to have a treaty. They would also have a much easier time fighting the Mountain Men outside of Mt. Weather because they couldnt get in but their scouts could easily ambush and kill them on the ground like they did with Bellamys group when he went to look for Octavia and the Mountain Men Indras scouts caught trying to assassinate or ship Clarke and Lexa. Basically if they leave the mountain base they have no need for the Reapers to get them fresh blood direct result of this is that Grounders stop getting taken the Mountain Men are going to be much more occupied with taking out the Arkers meaning they have a temporary truce this gives the weakened grounders a chance to get their strength back and then flank the Mountain Men when they leave to kill the Arkers. Lexa could have been planning ahead and wouldnt have been able to tell her troops and the Arkers because the Mountain Men would hear but she could send messengers after the retreat to tell the other armies about her plan. She could have said not to go near the mountain because that was part of the deal and she wanted her army at full strength and force to have a higher chance of winning. Ambushing an army in an open area is a lot easier than sending in rows of fighters into narrow hallways this could have been Lexas plan we dont know and all it meant was the loss of Clarkes people inside Mt. Weather.,The100,cplatl1,3,t5_2x5yb

3494619,0,t3_307z6g,Books  Although the genres are different I do like some of the similarities with GRRMs Game of Thrones. Especially in comparison with season . Another somewhat brutal work of fiction I enjoyed was Jacqueline Careys Kushiel series. The first trilogy was set in an alternate universe around the time of the Renaissance period. This has some light SampM just to warn ya. It was an epic adventure with loads of intrigue and various factions to deal with. As for television? Jericho. Cant say it often enough. Post apocalyptic small group struggling to survive and so underrated. Lost lost me a few seasons into it but many say this a good suggestion. Actors Eliza Taylor Clarke has done some good work I hear on an Aussie show called Neighbours. I have that on my to watch list. Paige Turco Abby  has been onscreen for a long time. Check her IMDB for something that may interest you.Henry Cusick Kane is a well known actor who is also doing a role on Scandal atm. He is really gifted and known well for his part in Lost.

So maybe the missing females are unaccounted for from the audiences perspective because theyre all pregnant might become pregnant nursing or having just miscarried.

With Emerson however he seemed way too calm when coming face to face with some of the people who wiped out everything knew. His plan with the babies makes sense. However it would have been better if Bellamy came up with it because I think Emerson would be or should be full of rage during the first stand off. Bellamy suggesting they help Emerson with the babies could be used to diffuse his rage. Bellamy would still make getting them to the comms Emersons payment though.I also feel a scene is missing after they make it out of MW. Emerson wouldnt want to go with them to Camp Jaha. Personally once they see CJ i think he would have given Bellamy the baby he was carrying and made him swear they would take care of the babies. Everyone in CJ would likely want to kill him.Minus Bellamy Abby and maybe Kane So he goes back into the forest and in another episode hopefully he runs into Clarke.

Lexa is the first incarnation of the commander who united the  clans and stopped them from fighting each other.Lexa was originally Trikru before she became commander and was training as Anyas second before she was called to rule. Grounder clans...at least what weve seen so far are formed into military units. So each village within a Clan presumably has its own unit of warriors.  Like Indra Anya and Tristan lead a band of warriors. But all those units answer to the commander. Think Roman Empire. However Im not sure if each Clan works the same way. Because Ice Nation has a queen. So it could be a different set up for each Clan and theyre allowed to govern their own domains but if theyre called to war they have to answer to the commander. ,The100,ctk94pr,2,t5_2x5yb

The leak that shocked me the most was TV Guide by Sadie Gennis.  I dont know why they keep her around over there or how the hell she can get a leak past her editors and posted on their site. This is mostly the fault of the network for releasing  screeners to every moron with a tumblr blog. There has got to be a better way to do this.

6551420,0,t3_45cqri,Welp...that was an episode. So heres my first glance analysis that I know youre all dying to see s P The title of the episode was an obvious one. Nia dies Roan takes over. Lexas leadership is thrown into question and an internal power struggle within the Ark. An appropriate title as it was really unclear throughout the whole episode which way the leaderships would swing. Except the Ark. I know we all saw that one coming. But now lets break this apart real quick. We have Nia with an agenda against Lexa now eliminated. Roan will take over and the people seem to be okay with it but whats really unclear is what he wants. I think for the longest time hes just wanted to go home and in spite of this new circumstance may fall under the influence of his people in order to stay king. Maybe hell side with Lexa personally but its hard to tell. Lexas still the leader but shes not who I want to talk about. First off props to udulldelinquent for the amazing call. This ones for you bud! Anyway Lexa is shaping up the nightbloods giving us insight to how the Commander is chosen. In an unexpected twist Nia got her hands on a nightblood and probably wanted to use that against Lexa forcing her to follow tradition of the Woods Clan and install a leader loyal to the Ice Nation. But with Nia dead where will Ontari go now? Lastly Pike. Who will actually get his own bullet point. Pike is doing the wrong things but for the right reason. He is completely justified in what he wants to do but hes ignoring important factors surrounding that. He wasnt there when Arkadia and Tondc made their peace. Kane and Indra have been holding a steady alliance and friendship. They are under Lexas protection and have the army to protect them. By moving against that army Pike is threatening the alliance between the Ark and Tondc as well as the Sky People and the Woods Clan note that I separated the groups as location and clanship Of course when Lexa and Clarke investigate this shits gonna go down. Clarke will say her people didnt do it Farm Stations to blame and there are further divides in the groupings. What we had with Kane was diplomacy and strategy. Kane had the experience of being a council member and head of security. Pike is a teacher who hasnt had the experience that Kane had. He thinks hes making the hard decisions and while he may believe its justified which it is on perspective he just simply doesnt have all the facts to make that call. Hes rushing into things. Kane has lost people too but he hasnt rushed into kill mode yet. Not this season anyway... Rip our beautiful dropship... So we got a little insight into how Montys dealing. Thats rough. Each member of the  have their crosses to bear and for the most part have dealt with it on their own terms aside from Raven who refuses to but Jasper seems to just be taking down everyone around him. I do think that after that little fumble with Finn hes going to I have no idea what the hell is happening honestly. I can give you a run down of his emotional state but I cant give you any calls as to where that may lead. Lexas outfits are on point this season! Like damn. So we see how Lexa fights. When I rewatch on netflix tomorrow I can probably run it down further but so far shes been the warrior weve been told she is. The tensions between her and Clarke seem to be dropping each episode. Things are still rough and Clarke is only there for her people but so far Lexa has been true to her word. Which is what I want to talk about. After word of what Pike does gets out where would her loyalties lie then? She swore loyalty to Clarke. That her people will be treated as Lexas own. I guess the answer to this depends on how extreme the divide between the rest of the Ark is. I dont doubt her loyalty to Clarke Im just asking how much shell let on for the sake of her people. Sad as it is to say its been a losing battle for Sky People since day one. But for the longest time theyve been fighting Grounders. Now well theyre literally their own worst enemy. Speaking of LexArke... Remember Pike will be attacking  Woods Clan members. These are warriors gathered by Indra from the villages surrounding the Ark which stands in the middle of Trikru territory. This will not go over lightly. Titus still being sketch as usual but what strikes me odd this season is that he seems to be catching on to the pushpull relationship between Lexa and Clarke. And I dont think itll be long before he starts exploiting that. There is still a lot we dont know and maybe Im jumping into things. But he has a connection with the past commanders as well as Alie infinity in his basement and the sky people drop pod. Theres a lot to be explained there.Your kill count so far!

6552123,0,t3_45dds6,Sadly I dont think Bellamy is there to keep an eye on Pike. Hes hurting real bad and Pike is giving him an opportunity to do something about it. Bellamy is much more of a handson act first and think later type of guy. Which is why I think Clarke was such a great foil to his character and brought out his potential. Without that person to rein him in while trusting him like Clarke or Kane we get S Bellamy. Pike has him pegged and hes hitting all the right buttons to get Bellamy to act in his interests. I think the only person who could have talked sense into him was Clarke because he strongly respects and trusts her. I dont really think he holds nearly as much love for Kane or Abby. I wish he was just a spy because Bellamy is easily my second favorite character. His character growth from season  to season  was astounding. I just hope he isnt completely Finnd and he realizes his mistake before getting to those troops.,The100,czx1knn,4,t5_2x5yb

Mount Weather is gone Azgeda is apparently neutralized and pretty much everything between them and Jaha is Grounders. What are they gonna broadcast Clarke and Lexa flirting with each other and Jasper freaking out? So theyre forcing a new conflict.Frankly I think theres potential for new actors in the field. We know there are mutations around maybe introduce some mutant enclave?

Or maybe now bellamy will be able to do waht he had plan  see previous paragraph .bellamy was my favorite character and if he betray his ppl and kill the  grounders on a whim after taking  or  shots at the bar with the other guy and getting all seduce and shit ill be really disapointed.Also from previous season and what they  skycrew  have endured together and went through its very hard for me to believe they would ditch Abby and Kane and drink that guys word like its a miracle potion.TLDR  i think they are screwing up bellamys character i hope they dont and bellamy will backstab that guy and return to his people  to use their term  and Kane gets chancelor.,The100,czxz4ch,2,t5_2x5yb

To have some other event in mind that exists in an entirely different world than what you are building leads to a lot of false and forced analogies that are about as subtle as a hammer hitting you over the head. Their reality isnt necessarily our reality. I think it was a mistake for JR to consider real world events and try to bend the narrative of his story to reflect it.

6614640,0,t1_d03hu0r,I could definitely see the Finn arc having been divisive back then.  When I was watching it it didnt bother me that much but I did think it was a little odd what they did with Finns character.  I thought the way they ended it made up for the weirdness of it.  Having Clarke kill Finn to spare him the torture was genius.  Id hate to see the same fate for Bellamy though!  Not only because wed be losing Bob who I personally feel is much more talented as an actor than Thomas McDonell who I wasnt sad to see go but because it would also be a retelling of the same Finn arc.  Its hard to see what kind of redemption arc would make me feel the same way about Bellamy again assuming he goes through with the massacre in the next episode and they dont pull some kind of retcon where he doesnt end up participating or something.  Not just from the perspective that what he does is terrible but that it was utterly completely stupid nonsensical and suicidal.  Man I am so nervous to see this play out! LOLETA Oh yes and the shipping war thing.  It saddens me to see people get wrapped up in that nonsense.  Its one thing to enjoy the chemistry of the actors and hope for a certain outcome but the story and characters must always come first!

6773000,0,t1_d0jxodf,See I thought he was the Wallace who gave a damn about the grounders! Cage and Tsing clearly dehumanized them to a point where it was easy for them to brutalize them in the name of survivalprogress which is such a perfect real world allegory for the reality of situations like that theres this whole tangent I could go on about the conditioning the US Armed Forces instituted postWWII and Korea after they found out their servicemen didnt actually like killing other human beings and how it plays into the psychology of warfare and explains a lot about Pike and his people but Ill stop myself but Dante is the one who says I bear it so they dont have to to Clarke. To me that said he knows what hes doing is wrong and he does it regardless because its the only way he can see to ensure his peoples continued existence. Obviously there are arguments to be made that he could have just asked for the blood or instituted a sort of tech for hemoglobin handoff but the fact remains that in order to keep his people alive he needed that blood. And later Skaikrus marrow. I honestly dont know that there is a moral absolute I can draw here because if the choice is allow innocent children to die or kill somebody else I dont have a personal answer as to what Id do.The same goes for Pike at least as it pertains to clearing the grounder village. I should add the village as opposed to the massacre of the grounder army that was a textbook preemptive attack which I understand from him but dont sympathize with much. Hes been sending out teams to check all the nearby land and Bellamy has that we talked about this line implying that if Pike had found other arable soil close enough he would have left the village alone. Hes trying to find a way to keep his people from starving and the only road he can see is pushing that village out.I dont think hes right but if I give credit to the sincerity of his worldview and to the reality of his experience on the ground and that Arkadia needs land if they want to grow food of their own I cant help but wonder what I would do. Id like to think I could rise above and see the need for cooperation over fuck yall Imma get mine but if Im dirty and hungry and terrified and being asked to work with people who were trying to kill me half a year ago I dont know that I can say for sure Id be able to rise above.I think theres a lack of people putting themselves in Pikes place or that of the rank and file Arkadian yes the best choice is probably a truce but come on. This is a heightened situation with some pretty intense history between all parties and removing the emotional weight of what theyve all been through is a pretty crucial bit of analysis to skip.,The100,d0k02tw,3,t5_2x5yb

6802995,0,t3_48xmqy,I had heard that she was in the nd half of the season so was quite shocked by her death. I like how it happened though theyve been building up that Titus would be the one to do it. Im not a Clexa shipper though so I imagine Im in the minority of liking it and not being heartbroken. How did none of the guards hear the gunshots though?Clarke calling Murphy a friend was a bit weird Clarke has always hated Murphy but then again they havent seen each other in over  months so maybe shes taken the time to reflect. Looking forward to more scenes between these  they could be the badass partnership that fixes things in the second half of the season.Poor Indra shes clearly broken about the massacre. I can see her really pushing the gun issue as shes the only person alive who has seen how OP guns are compared to a load more people who only have swordsspeararrows as their weapon well the sniper after the TonDC bombing last season screwed them over too and Nyko with Finns massacre but still. Thank goodness that Octavia knocked some sense into her and that they seem closer than ever now.Going back a few episodes Id have liked to have seen the actual massacre or at least the part where Bellamy had spared Indra it feels weird because its hard to grasp how difficult that situation was for them both.Octavia was pretty spot on about Clarke even considering staying what a stupid idea that would have been and now she and Murphy are stuck there.The flashbacks were awesome but with their accents Im not sure what country they belonged too. I thought that maybe there might have been  American stations but the commander said the American station not the other American station so there goes my theory.Seeing that missiles flying around the planet and everyones reaction to it was heartbreaking that must have been awful but it was a great thing to show.I wonder who the malfunctioned chip will choose now. I hope its Ontari and that the ice nation gets pulled back into the story.Im hoping that this isnt the end of the flashbacks but I think it might be for a while. Theres a lot they could tell us about Becca and what happened once she landed.What happened with the missing circle on Lexas back? Does it tie into Becca or is this a separate story about how Lexa came to be the commander?Small detail They didnt show the full intro of Bellamy talking about Arkadia and their peoples struggles seeing as this was a Polis episode I quite like that they did that.,The100,d0nevcn,1,t5_2x5yb

6806173,0,t1_d0nqw4w,I suppose that could be true. My only doubt is that the Commander didnt know the nature of Beccas research until two years after the bombs went off and surely if there were only a very small number of people onboard he would know what was going on to some extent.Regardless Alpha station were probably right to be trigger happy.

6807749,0,t1_d0nlkky,Im defending it because this was a very meaningful death. If Lexa had arrived a moment earlier she would have used her own body as a shield. We know this. Lexa went against the advice and pressure of the  clans to kill Clarke and her people she put her own life in danger. The significance of the gun is also worth mentioning. To give your life for someone else is the ultimate sacrifice and proof of  commitment and love. I think an assassination is a more predictable outcome and would be less meaningful than how it played out.,The100,d0nydes,1,t5_2x5yb
6811724,0,t1_d0ocm9q,gt I reckon they get to have some hugs and some latitude for being treated poorly rather than told to shut up. Thats the crazy thing about that love scene into the death scene. I think that it was bad but at the same time really fucking great. Its a odd feeling to have and I understand why it may not sit well for a lot. Though I think people going the shut up route probably came from people seeing fans literally shit all over Jason and various people. I mean you had death threats being made and people going at people just because their opinion of the episode was different. Hell you got people saying they are completely done with this show and others calling the show runner a homophobe. You got people who are supporters of the LGBTQ community being called traitorsamong other things simply because their opinion didnt align with some.Im just tipping the iceberg when it comes to the shit that Ive seen already...and that was just about  minutes of looking aroundwhen shit first hit the fan.So yeah I get that people need time to come to gripes with this. Though people tend to forget that they brought us these moments and characters. Whose to say that there arent bigger and better moments down the line? I just dont want this show to go down simply because Lexa didnt get a happy ending. I think her character is more than that and I think the show deserves better than a premature end.Honestly with some of the talk I hear from some fans. They would rather see this show burn. That means no more Clarke and the array of other great characters in the show. I cant align with that and if this show goes down because of it then I will be disappointed.,The100,d0oemkz,2,t5_2x5yb

6815842,0,t1_d0oq3p0,gt What I find it most weird is that ALIE . was meant to control  destroy ALIE .. If so it should know through Lexa that the Ark has crashed down and it should have tried to do something to at least find out if ALIE . is still activeIm not sure how that was relevant.  A.L.I.E. v. and v. have coexisted on the planet since Becca came down  years after the nukes.  A.L.I.E. v wasnt on the ark she was confined to the remaining computer systems on earth.  If anything it should be the other way around which it is.  A.L.I.E. v is actively seeking out her upgrade but v thinks her predecessor nuked herself.You have to remember A.L.I.E. v. also nuked herself in the way.  She was only able to exist in such power because those computerpower systems existed.  After she nuked the earth she was pretty much confined to whatever remaining systems existed which is likely a bunch of unnetworked systems and that nuclear backpack that Jaha and his crew carries around.Its clear that we have a lot yet to learn about both A.L.I.E. systems and I actually think that v vs v could be some sort of endgame or season finale plotline.  This show has me more on its hook than ever and I really hope it delves more into its scifi aspect as it continues.Im also a little curious since both A.I. seem to be integrated into the human body.  What makes them different?  A.L.I.E. v initially seemed like she was confined to computer systems but now obviously has the pill computer chip that people can eat and it interfaces with their body.  Isnt that exactly what A.L.I.E. v does?  Is it just the programming?,The100,d0ovg46,3,t5_2x5yb

ADC portrays her so incredibly. So her death basically ruined me much more than I had anticipated. I figured shed die at some point but not so sudden like that.I hate saying it but Im still not really over it. Much like music TV shows can have a strong impact on me. A lot of my friends and such dont understand and just say its just a TV show. But its more than that. I was able to take away a lot of Lexas character and become more confident in myself. Hell as someone who hates attention I dressed as Lexa for my first ever cosplay! The amount of people that wanted pictures and wanted to talk about The  was amazing. Because I owe a lot of my confidence to the character its been really hard to cope! But I started making a song. Ive been making music samples and little tidbits here and there for the last  years but never made a full length song. Its proven to be very difficult but its therapeutic. Its a song for Lexa.

6889415,0,t1_d0x51jf,I guess cause they didnt get to see what was happening in polis and how Lexa was trying to be peaceful with the skaikru its hard for them to believe that the true purpose of the  grounders was to protect them. But I still think Bellamy should die.I had some hoped that the show could explore things other than war this season or at least not fall back in to a story theyve already done Sky people vs grounders in season . I was hoping that maybe the show could put the war on the back burner so there was some peace even if it was uneasy and focus on things like the CoL. Thats a really great story they have and its been ignored mostly till now. And now its going to be explored but itll be over shadowed by a war.I guess Im just pissed off cause I thought theyd do something different but this season is just going to repeat the last seasons plot with different characters.About Lexas death also I think it was badly timed because it sort of overshadowed everything else that happened in that episode. For example no one talks about the reveal of what happened to the th station or at from least what Ive seen people talk about. Also I think clexa should have at least had some more time to be happy together. But I guess I cant change anything about the show..,The100,d0x8dpa,0,t5_2x5yb

7022515,0,t1_d1c2pbi,I understand that they had to implement new characters to develop the show but the arkers and grounders should be side factions like mount weather was. The tone shift was just too much for me I guess. I think the main problem with the grounders was that they almost unbeatable in the first season they could pick off people without being seen at crazy distances seemingly whenever they wanted. Now they all got humanized and entire armies of them could be wiped out by like  people. Granted those  people had machine guns but the grounders had literally JUST went to war with Mt Weather so they had experience being fired upon and the arkers probably had minimal practice shooting at stationary targets. I think it would have gone better if the drama on the ark had continued in the sky a bit more before they landed. Or if the traitors from the ark actually survived instead of being killed off screen. Haha sorry for being so long winded just venting,The100,d1ccqib,3,t5_2x5yb
7028803,0,t1_d1d27at,No problem. I think having an actual antagonist for the Arkadia story instead of bringing the antagonist inhouse and then making everyone agree with them would have made it easier to swallow and more aligned with the whole none of us is innocent POV.  Right now separating out my three seasons of dislike for Bellamy its pretty easy to see who the bad guys are in that story and thats unfortunate considering its the first time weve really seen that. I mean even the Mountain Men had more nuance when they were drilling up the  than Pike Hannah amp Bellamy do at the moment.  ,The100,d1d2gzk,7,t5_2x5yb

7036955,0,t3_4c0bxm,This is how I understand the episode.Mount Weather were desperate to survive and they had exhausted all of their defences by the season  finale making the hostage deal with the grounders their last hope. They had no need for grounder blood or grounder hostages anymore. Mount Weather probably proposed the hostage exchange differently ie. asked Lexas army to retreat before making the exchange. However Lexa and the grounders hold the power in this situation because they have the largest army. Therefore Lexa could realistically counter demand that Mount Weather release the hostages before her army leaves guaranteeing the safety of her people. Mount Weather have two choices they accept Lexas counterproposal and release the hostages or they refuse and basically sentence their people to death. Mount Weather didnt really have a choice at all. Yes Lexa could have gone back on her word and attacked Mount Weather after getting the hostages back. However if she did attack inevitably some of her people would die in combat.  By betraying Clarke and accepting the deal she had saved her people whist obtaining zero casualties injuries.  I believe she says something along the lines of I made this decision with my head not my heart. So Id say that strategically Lexa made the right choice and the decision had nothing to do with her feelings for Clarke.,The100,d1dzuad,2,t5_2x5yb

7115933,0,t3_4d1oz1,I think they will end up working with him to defeat ALIE. Right now the pieces of information is spread across several people. Jasper Raven and by next episode Abbyspoiler knows about ALIE. Clarke knows about Ontari and the implant. The rest knows about what else has been going on in Arkadia. I wonder if Murphy has told her about ALIE. I assume not.Prediction Clarke returns to Arkadia to talk to Lincoln to find out where Luna is. She also knows Ontari will be gunning for them so she might want to get them to either prepare for the attack or run for the hills. In order to do so they must neutralize Pike but then they find out about ALIE and she might present herself as the bigger threat so they end up working with Pike to do so.

Maybe she has to combine both her politician and military expertises and become a new leader not so different to the monster that Pike had become. But with the presence of ALIE is probable that her story takes her away more of Arkadia and their troubles shes thinking now like an international politicial not as a representative of some local politics.  What youve said its not how a politician mind should work in real life I agree but then again shes playing now with a much larger game board its just the writers had made her just other piece again.,The100,d1o0chf,1,t5_2x5yb

Then she playfully half threatens him while acting sexy and he jokingly says hes doing it to survive when he obviously was never that opposed to it.I think if they took that same dialogue and acted it out differently or changed the dialogue around a bit they could have made it seem like rape but thats not at all how it comes off on screen.

7267603,0,t1_d244uk0,gt No youre not missing anything the writing is still lazy as ever. The entire fiasco couldve been resolved with a blindfold and duck tape. Apparently no one is bright enough to understand that in the shows universe.I agree that was a little weird but I think at this point they had realized that she wouldnt stop at anything to get those things off her so they decided to go soft on her. Im sure she would have gone crazy until they took off the duck tape.gt Also there may be no good guys as the show is fond of pointing out endlessly but Im pretty sure someone that massacres hundreds of sleeping people is worse than being no good theyre a psychotic nut job thats crazy. You cannot redeem a person like that Bellamy.The army in question was part of a coalition that included a barbaric Ice Nation and all of whose other member clans were in favor of harsh policy against Skaikru. All  ambassadors including the ambassador to the clan from which most of the peacekeeping force came had recently conspired with Queen Nia of the th clan to kill  innocent members of Skaikru just to make a statement about Lexas weakness. All  clans voted no confidence in Lexa in order to install Nia as the commander part of whose explicitly stated platform was wiping out Skaikru. Not to mention the fact that many soldiers in that peacekeeping force probably had either killed a Skaikru person during Seasons  amp  or knew someone who did and was proud of it any many knewloved someone who had been killed by Skaikru. Not exactly a friendly army. Not for long anyway. That doesnt at all justify massacring them of course but its not crazy that a bunch of scared traumatized and starving because of M.W. people whove lost most of their friends and relatives would do that under these circumstances. It happens all the time in the real world under much less comprehensible conditions.That being said I agree that Bellamy cant be redeemed so quickly. I am hopeful that this will stay with him in a meaningful way for a long time.

And it will likely turn out that Lexa has been helping EmoriLuna keep her cover intact from afar if we consider what Titus told us about the conclave. And that will mean Lexa is still providing protection for Clarke in a way by having helped cover for the outcast clan that will take them in next season.I mean...

7376125,0,t1_d2gb04d,I know very well what a hallucination is and how drugs work thanks. A virtual reality is not like a hallucination though because it interacts with you just like a real object. You can move things run into them eat them touch them whatever. Virtual reality affects your consciousness just like a real external object  thats why they call it a reailty. A mirage or a hallucination doesnt do that. You think you see something but if you get close you cant touch it. Your body will move right through it. You cant sit on a hallucinated chair but you can on a virtually real chair. I think the show has clearly failed to explain virtual reality to its viewers.,The100,d2gm47r,1,t5_2x5yb

7397390,0,t3_4gjlik,The more I think about it the more I think Clarke will become the commander.  The season started with her effectively being the most powerful character as Wanheda.  Now she is wearing commander armour and carries the flame.  Just wondering whether the idea all along has been to leading to Wanheda taking the throne.  If she destroys the col she would remind everyone that she is Wanheda and perhaps the grounders will bow before her for saving them.  Finale scene.. A shockedconfused looking Clarke surrounded by bowing grounders chanting her name?,The100,d2j1995,1,t5_2x5yb
7398462,0,t1_d2j4z12,I dont think the character is lost but hes in a VERY tough hole to come out from.  With the way the show set it up it was so indefensible and so extreme I just dont know how they can steer the ship.  They at least needed to act like the grounders COULD be a threat something they failed on horribly.  I mean not only did they fail making them a potential threat but reinforced it being a damn protection force the audience knows is legit.  If they made it fall into questionable territory then its very easy to at least understand the position.  Finding yourself in that perfect grey area where you can never be sure what is right or wrong.  They just butchered it so badly...Bellamy knows Lincoln knows tree folks knows his sisters integration with them and knows it was the ice clan pulling all the crap.  Also well aware of the grounder strength and exactly what would happen as a result.  Thus the only logical way to boil it down is his girlfriend died and he felt like murdering some folks that had nothing to do with it.I think the show wanted to portray things as more grey and wanted to give the impression that perhaps they could hold them off but everything they have done points the opposite direction.  The massacre needed dramatic consequences and once they are surrounded it has to be threatening.  Plot reasons and all that. One can hope the writers have a long game but im not so sure.  I genuinely think they hoped turning on Pike would swing people back around.  Even then a long game scares me.  He has his issues and they need to be explored and progressed but I also dont want to lose what made him so great in the first place.As I keep mentioning in a world of uncertain decisions he tends to walk a little closer to that hard choice side.  The last thing I want is for him to be some bland moralistic angel and the writers forcing the story to have it pay off.  I still want him to be Bellamy where some sort of hard choice can still turn out to be the right one.,The100,d2j5my6,3,t5_2x5yb

7420030,0,t3_4gxbzk, More torture delightful because we always need more of that especially with weird Christian overtones despite the dearth of them in the Grounders religion. Whats up with that? It feels like weve lost half our cast. With ALIE we have. Jahas the only one who maintains some semblance of a personality with the chip and even then its whittled him down to singleminded ambition Abby is so devoid of everything that shes a puppet used to sexually coerce Kane. I enjoyed the SEAL Team  Floudonkru. The oil rig makes me think of the Grand Banks oil rigs but I doubt they got that far away. Of course if the oil rig still works they could have motorpowered boats without any trouble. Pike. Well the flashbacks showed that the version were seeing now was always there and it busted out when he started beating on Murphy. A muchneeded hard lesson with a dollop of psychological conditioning for the group to help each other? Or yet another parade of meaningless violence thats meant to toughen everyone up in this seasons continuing throughline of might  right? Not that it actually stuck given Murphys time on the ground is basically full of finding the most powerful person ingratiating himself to them and doing his best to stay alive no matter what that is the delinquents turned against him so easily after Charlotte murdered Wells and the factionalism in the early  camp dont seem like that part of Earth Skills really stuck.

7433912,0,t1_d2mtlbc,Yes Alie is pretty unaware of human emotions and as a consequence of erasing pain the chipped people seem to have gone totally emotionless. The writers might want to point out that pain is what help us to feel positive feelings as a rejection a compensation a relief a human natural reaction etc. And this points out as well that the vision of a Paradise where suffering doesnt exist can actually be seen as a false reward because then there will be no pleasure nor joy. But some might love this idea of being free from emotions as Jaha who subscribes to the Alie . paradise. After his sons death hes not concerned by love or joy anymore so hes right this paradise is good for him. But not for others.

7434121,0,t1_d2n4yj5,I really dont understand this view of the grounders as nothing but savages. And due to that view its perfectly okay for them to be killed in their sleep with no chance of defending themselves.Pike wanted to send the army away because he has a hatred for them. He sees them as nothing but savages pretty much like how youve seen them and they will only kill them. Kane however interacted more with the grounders he knew Lexa he knew that becoming the th clan could result in an alliance which would protect his people. I totally understand your political aspect with the lack of democracy on Kanes view. But then the only reason Pike became chancellor was because Kane allowed a vote he gave his people the chance to vote on the matter. And frankly if you look at history we should learn from history and realise that this type of behaviour and war isnt good for mankind. People always refer to history like because its happened it must continue to happen. However history should be teaching us how to be different. We should learn from our mistakes. ,The100,d2n7ne4,1,t5_2x5yb

My point is that as far as we know based on whats happened on the screen the Chippers havent killed anyone yet. They were shooting at Jasper and Hannah looked like she was about to kill Octavia and Raven almost bled to death when she was possessed but no chipped person has actually been confirmed to have killed or caused the death of someone else.

7455468,0,t1_d2pgtuy,Exactly. They were extending the classconflicts theme on the Ark  Pike was a teacher part of the working class forced to do something by the ruling class that he didnt really agree with. I thought it added some great insight into his relationship with Kane. Not that that made me sympathetic towards him but it was sort of an oh so thats why things are the way they are.

7470130,0,t3_4h370y,Pike is actually a great character the fact that you cant watch him is probably more due to the fact that you cant stand him. Because from our point of view is a crazy retarded old man who is fuckin up everything our hero tried to do for  season.Youve got to put yourself in his shows tho he stayed  month I think in the Ice nation before joining the rest of the gang. The ice nation grounders arent has nice has the Trikru they are vile and dangerous and thats all he saw. Go watch some of the earlier episodes focus on Bellamy he doesnt trust them all he saw from them were his friends getting hurt and killed. Thats all Pike knows he is a bad guy from our point of view but from his from the people of Arkadia who are not clarke and co. who did not meet and talk peace personnaly with the grounders Pike is a hero a savior the one that can protect them against an ennemy they fear.Keep in mind also that every time the Grounders have regrouped somewhere the skaikru people have always ended up being damaged the dropship fight mount weather retreat you can understand him.Try to understand the character motivation youre gonna see that the writing aint that bad after all,The100,d2rb42m,1,t5_2x5yb

7486821,0,t1_d2t6f9a,ahhhhh! yes yes yes!! Like the skaikru took down the mountain. they risked EVERYTHING. Technically speaking finn didnt even have to die in order for them to team up and take down MW because they never needed the grounders help. It was Bellamy who took down the mountain from the inside allowing Lexas squad to move in it was Ravenwick who made it possible to weaken the front door it was Monty who made it even possible to kill all the grounders and it was Bellamy and Clarke who in turn pulled the trigger. They rightfully should have owned that place and I disappointed in Kane for even trying to talk the others out of using the facility and the great things it had to offer because Lexa and her  clans wouldnt like it. Pike moving his people in made complete sense and proves again what his characters future actions in the next episodes would be like. Especially after we got that flashback of him on the ark in x. survival at all costs that what hes been living by since he hit the ground. Its what drives him to make all his decisions his lack of morality sometimes tactical unmerciful way of thinking..it all just makes a lot of sense when you realize hes operating with one strongly driven narrow mindset that he must survive at all costs.,The100,d2t7lwk,1,t5_2x5yb

Becca also did things on her own without listening to her colleagues thinking she could do better and fix everything by herself. Raven is just as ambitious and now has an insight into Beccas viewpoint both through knowledge acquired from ALIE and from Beccas journal. And while she does seem like a wild card now what if she does rush without waiting for Clarke and it actually serves for the best in the long run? Because of course they wont defeat ALIE before the finale.,The100,d2tk8gh,2,t5_2x5yb

I dont mean that somehow hearts and rainbows will fly out of everybody and love will magically save the day love has already proved itself to be the glitch in the matrix with Finn was real. What I mean is that love of a person of the world of self of whatever motivates any specific person is going to play into ALIEs defeat because love is the pinnacle of the parts of humanity that ALIE doesnt understand.,The100,d2uhm0w,1,t5_2x5yb

7502443,0,t3_4i3wvk,I think if she is in season  that would be the most interesting story to tell. She has such a different perspective than anyone weve seen on the show and I think not just Clarke but all of the  could learn from her. All theyve known since they got on the ground is violence so it would be interesting for them to learn that that is not the only way. I think it could be a real healing process for all of them as they all hold so much guilt. If they can learn that there is not just a choice but a better one maybe theyll eventually be able to adopt that way of thinking and in time forgive themselves for what theyve done.That being said I think that would only work if they went to stay with Lunas people. She is about peace and free will as you said but it is in a place where those hard choices dont have to be made. She hadnt killed in so long because there were no threats to her and her people. As we saw in last nights episode when in a life or death situation she chose to kill just like Clarke and all the others have time and time again. I dont think her philosophy would be as easy to carry out on land where they face violence every day but if she went to land it would be interesting to see how she would balance her moral codevow to not kill with constant threats of violence.Regardless I think the differing views between Luna and Clarke would be a very interesting and complex storyline for next season. Seeing them influence one another and how they view being leaders would be very similar to how Clarke and Lexa influenced one another but just in a different way. Having the perspective of nonviolence would be very intriguing for characters and a show that is so much about having to compromise ones morals in order to survive. Hopefully well see Luna in season .,The100,d2uzlhn,5,t5_2x5yb

And thats why she rejected them... because they werent ready yet to be of any use to her! They were still playing the game! Maybe she was testing them and they failed!

7542832,0,t3_4imgiu,Pike is interesting. He hasnt changed at all and yet our perspective of him has... since hes now deemed to be fighting for the correct team whatever that is in this world as far as hes concerned hes still on the same side the side of his peoples survival. Hes still the Pike that would massacre an army if he didnt trust it though. He hasnt learnt anything about who he is or his behaviour. In Join or Die he said This is about what I expected upon entering Polis for the first time and seeing the blood in the streets and the people being crucified.This is the same narrative trick they pulled with Bellamy back in S. Same Bellamy different team. He never actually changed much. Its only now from . onwards that we are beginning to see Bellamy have some real character growth and learning... that will be a much longer and slower process with Bellamy than what they are doing with Pike which is basically just flipping the perspective.Im not sure whether or not theyll kill Pike off.

They obviously are trying to show that Bellamy is noticing somethings not right with Clarke emotionally with how they keep showing him looking at Clarke looking at the chip.

7568127,0,t1_d32gfzi,I dont think it is bad editing. I think they are just trying to show that there is still a disconnection there.These guys were all snarking and snipping at each other throughout S and Clarke was totally a part of that and comfortable with it. Ever since she moved into a more solitary leadership role in S shes withdrawn herself from them not the other way around. They have the dynamic theyve always had largely they all seem comfortable around each other even when they are furious at each other. Its Clarke who is keeping herself at a distance and keeps walking off or changing the topic when they are just being themselves around her.Shes walking on eggshells around all of them but they arent walking on eggshells around her theyre just being themselves with her. Thats why it looks kind of out of place right now. They are all angry and upset and scared and grieving and guilty and Clarke is just.... aloof. But I dont think its something the show isnt aware of! Clarke will crack eventually and her friends will have a much better idea of how to help her then and she will be able to stick up for herself too not by trying to be strong and distant and fix everything but by allowing herself to be vulnerable with them. I think most of them have figured out something is definitely not quite right with Clarke. Judging by the sneak peek she is just confusing the heck out of them right now. They open up and she changes the subject or tries to fix them they can fix themselves Clarke. They push and she walks off. If they asked if she was okay shed say she was fine they just need to fix this you know she would. The frustration we as the audience are feeling?

I think it wasnt further discussed because the only way it seems now is by establishing the next commander as sky person Clark. She will somehow simulate gene therapy and be able to take the flame. This will give her the chance to stop alie but not kill her as she will be abandoned in the Ark in space.Afterwards she will somehow become the next commander and uniting all the clans under one including Ice Nation and Sky people.

Regardless of how the finale plays Id say my preference for the three seasons goes Season  gt Season  gt Season .

7636041,0,t3_4jvr0f,gt everything I see is telling me in big neon signs that hes in love with her.Yeah pretty much.But... Disclaimer!Personally for me as a viewer I think whatever their future plans for these two are they should hold it off for as long as possible. The individual characters and the story should be first priority I think. I like Bellamy an awful lot. I desperately want them to put his character first and not ruin him for a romance. Same for Clarke for that matter. I prefer subtlety anyway rather than overblown romance. But despite them telegraphing Bellamys feelings for Clarke at least it sure seems like that to me  I really cant see them going there any time soon. Though I think they plan to go there in the end. It would seem odd for them to have written some of the scenes they have this season for Bellamy if they didnt. But heck maybe hell just get over it fall in love with Echo or something and thatll be that. Who knows eh?Anyway thank you for starting this thread. I think it is good that we can discuss it respectfully with each other rather than completely denying some of the subtextimplications of what has been happening on screen for Bellamy or simply not talking about it at all. Maybe the show will even be able to get some useful feedback from discussions like this too. I like to think were a fairly sensible and mature bunch of fans here on The  subreddit whatever our flavour and however we read or interpret the show. Theres no earthly reason why we shouldnt have a mature discussion about this and then collectively if we as a community have vague concerns about the direction the show is going in  it will be our voices that get heard hopefully rather than a bunch of maybe slightly overeager shippers who are happy to watch the rest of the story burn for the sake of a little romance! And as much as I am cool with the idea of BampC in the end  it really DOES have showruining potential if they in any way mess it up and prioritise it over believable character development. They just cannot afford to do that with their two main characters in my opinion.Its up to the writers of course but really theres nothing wrong at all with taking things slowly.

7693776,0,t3_4kp317,Im really not sure about the whole night blood thing. But I love the idea of ALIE still being alive I know you are all shocked. Here are my theories for why ALIE could still be alive. Clarke trying to milk every last bit of drama out of the moment that she could actually waited a second too long to pull the kill switch. ALIE finished the update but the update changed how she viewed humanity and everything about what she was doing. I just feel like as it is the whole update thing was really under cooked. Becca was supposedly making a better AI to fix all of the problems in the first one to learn from humans directly and understand what that truly means. Why go through all of this setup and have Becca even apologize to ALIE for being a shitty mom if all the update does is allow her to delete a kill switch. It is really boring and doesnt make sense. Also in addition to getting the update she is listening to Clarke reject her plan. She does one of her trademark head tilts when Clarke says that you overcome pain. This goes directly against her core belief about humanity. All of my theories about ALIE involve the idea that she is constantly learning from all of the humans she is interacting with especially ones she has mind melded with. Only some of my theories about ALIE involve her being secretly in love with Raven.  So she gets the update and deletes the kill switch replacing it with a dummy. But then she terminates the CoL program anyway because she figured out it was all bullshit and humans had to choose for themselves. ALIE is a supercomputer so a couple of milliseconds are a lifetime to her more than enough time to pull a fast one on Clarke and make her think she destroyed her.. Clarke pulls the lever in time but ALIE in a last act of self preservation severs all links to the humans on the ground figuring that even if she is stuck in space and the CoL is destroyed she can still try to help humanity in other ways and thus is following her core programming. Her code may be partially damaged and she only has  of the update but the combined fragments of code form a new broken ALIE but that break makes her more human. The idea that you need a mistake to truly create new life is popular in science fiction for a lot of reasons but anyway this could be an interesting way to have her come back and be more alivehuman in a sense. Maybe she could even actually feel  understand pain now.How her rejoining the fray would work on a practical level I dont know. Maybe they could download her consciousness into the flame and then figure out a way to implant it in Raven... as just like one example...,The100,d3gqe1x,7,t5_2x5yb
7701651,0,t3_4ki155,Hahaha I mean Im a grown adult obsessively analyzing a fictional character. I am right there with you.I totally agree that characterization and growth is the priority. Im so looking forward to watching how Bellamy has to live with his mistakes and how he takes the lessons that hes learning and applies them. Because in the world of the show the how you get there will be constantly challenged and unclear. I love Clarke and its so amazing to have a female hero and leader. But her choices are usually presented in the narrative as the only real and terrible option  whether its firing the rocket launchers in the S finale amp closing the door Finn TonDC Mt Weather trying to force Luna etc. You can debate it for sure but the narrative justifies her choices its almost like shes asking the audience give me a better option and her challenge is to actually live with the consequencesown them and not run away.But Bellamy made the WRONG choice this season according to the narrative albeit for the same goal of keeping people safe. Not just a terrible and hard decision  but the wrong one  both morally and strategically. And how you live with that and have confidence in your decisions going forward is a really interesting journey that I look forward to watching. I cant wait to watch Bob Morley bring that struggle to the screen next year. ,The100,d3hmk7q,1,t5_2x5yb

7734844,0,t1_d3kcz6i,I feel ya. You and the OP put into words what Ive been vaguely feeling but couldnt quite place. I reflected on my opinion of Clarke recently and realized I thought of her as just another bland YA special snowflake. It was kind of startling because I didnt feel this way in seasons  and . She was a sassy intelligent person who had to make the hard decisions but did so in a way that was relatable and empathizable to the audience. My heart was in my throat during the season  finale because I knew exactly what was going on in Clarkes head and couldnt have made a decision myself because both choices could be justified but both were also wrong and it was so hard feeling the weight of hundreds of lives on Clarkes and my by proxy shoulders. But season ... all of that was taken out of the equation. Clarke made all the predictable decisions and she was always justified. She was the misunderstood hero I didnt think so but many people did judging by the reactions and everyone else looked like an asshole like you said. Ive seen other redditors say it should have been Raven who faced down ALIE and I agree  they just had to have Clarke do it because shes the Special One They All Depend On. There were no emotional stakes in the finale because she was always going to pull that lever and literally sat in a throne to do it... Speaking of thrones I also didnt like how by elevating Clarke Bellamy was pushed into more and more of a follower position. Not even a knight but more like her footsoldier or lackey. And I get hes going through his whole redemption arc and whatnot but it just doesnt feel right to see him gaze reverently at Clarke and treat her like his queen when they should be equals.

7808845,0,t1_d3trjxw,Cribbing from a previous comment of minegtThey dont come right out and say it but its also likely that theres an implicit caste system. Clarke was learning to be a doctor because... her mother taught her. Presumably the ark regulated how many people could have each kind of job because theyd be turbofucked if they had a generation that all wanted to be doctors. On paper this was probably egalitarian but in practice theres a good chance it was a fairly immobile society. If theres only three doctor slots Clarke would have been basically guaranteed one of them.Building on my own comment I bet Monty in part picked up his aptitude for engineering because at least one of his parents was into it.SOMEONE has to be the janitors... and you can be damn sure its going to be somebody more like Bellamy and someone less like Wells.  Thats true IRL too but somewhat obscured because of economic and educational stratification.  When everybody lives together class resentments are going to rise.

Now how many surviving factions do we have? The bottom three are Azgeda Trikru and The  as they are dark like blood. And we know those three factions have a lot of blood on their hands. Why the ? Because in every Skaikruled massacre a delinquent was there. The Culling preventable by Bellamy. Thee Dropship death by Clarke. Tondc Finn. Mt. Weather death by Clarke. The  warriors Bellamy.The one on the far left is Lunas Clan. Notice how on the surface its white and clean but below it isnt. While Luna keeps a peaceful society there are times where she must kill. Like when Alie showed up.But wait. The  is on the bottom row along with the Grounder Clans. What about the top two? Well The  were sent to the Ground remember? The Ark only followed after. Which is why theyre our top two rows. They represent the sky.On the left not as clean as Floukru but not as dark as the other three. Thats Skaikru. As much as they try to keep peace they find themselves in bloodshed but not of their own doing. Casualties in someone elses war as Kane put it.Then Farm Station. Keeping a dark secret.

If any of the leading ladies are going to die this season itll be towards the end. Clarke is save this season because Jason isnt writing the finale as a series finale and thats the only episode she would die in  if she dies. I also cant see Octavia die until The Blakes is on somewhat good terms again and its probably going to get worse before it gets better. Raven like Murphy is one I see surviving to the end.

8664291,0,t3_4yl6lt,If you read the original review thread a lot of people thought the Mountain Men were cannibals which of course is not correct.Its not too far from the truth though. In my opinion the Mountain Men were more like a vampire race dependent on draining human blood for their own survival. Also like vampires they are pale sickly creatures who must keep to the shadows and will burn up if they step out into daylight.The usage of art supplies as a peace offering then Clarke using them to mark up a map of Mount Weather shows that Wallace is a diplomat and Clarke is sometimes...undiplomaceable.Right. Clarke gets a lot of credit for being the one who was right about the Mountain men but she was actually wrong about Dante in some ways. It was true that Dante was holding the  prisoner  you dont invite guests to your home by gassing them and kidnapping them  but Dante didnt actually intend to harm them. It is stated later that Dante hoped adding the  to the gene pool would allow future generations of Mountain men to return to the surface. But its telling that Dante only abducted the teenagers not the adults. I think he imagined the kids would be easier to control and hadnt been prepared for a kid like Clarke. But I still wonder if Clarke had been less hostile and more willing to be diplomatic with Dante from the start if the whole wargenocide couldve been avoided. I find it interesting in this episode that both Clarke and Jasper are acting somewhat irrationally due to their differing personal traumas. Clarke is the one who was kept in solitary on the Ark and the reason for her imprisonment was that she knew classified council secrets. In Mt Weather Clarke is like a caged animal desperate to get loose find the truth and completely unwilling to trust the elected leaders of this new society. She was already willing to pull a lever and expose them all to radiation just because she felt untrusting before she even had proof there was anything shady going on. Jasper on the other hand suffered his worst trauma on the ground and is far too blindly trusting that the Mountain men are their rescuers. Its a shame they couldnt find a healthy balance of viewing the Mountain folk with caution and suspicion but not taking a completely demonized view of them either.     ,The100,d6onkv4,3,t5_2x5yb

Clarke would not have been morally justified at all but pulling that lever as a preemptive strike  with the benefit of hindsight  we know would actually have saved them all a lot of other deaths and trauma.   ,The100,d72b7ki,13,t5_2x5yb

8933412,0,t1_d7llkdc,Your feelings for an individual arent static. They can change over time. The enemies to lovers or friends to lovers trope is really popular in fiction.I dont believe in true love or love at first sight or any of that cheesy stuff so I guess Im kind of confused with your perspective. Their relationship is ambiguous and its completely understandable if you think theyre platonic or dont want to see them together but I dont understand why being friends first means they dont care about each other or that their dynamic wont become romantic in the future.I think that its both realistic for them to develop a strong connection as friends first and its practical in terms of writing their story for TV. Like someone said before leaving it ambiguous for now allows them to keep the will they or wont they tension as well as focus on the sci fi for now as theyre both leads. Im biased as my personal relationships are definitely influencing my perspective here because Ive been in this situation sort of?? lol no apocalypse or death I was close friends with someone for almost  years before we realized our feelings for each other. I think by being friends first we were able to get to know each other so by the time we were together romantically our connection was really strong. Often shows will focus on the sexual aspects of relationships first so I think its really refreshing to see such a deep connection between them as friends.,The100,d7lnx4t,6,t5_2x5yb

9692172,0,t3_5dvv5h,Tondc was once Washington DC and at one point Lincoln takes Octavia to the Lincoln memorial. Mt Weather is a real place in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountains maybe fifty miles from DC. Polis has that one tall building so its maybe a city other than Washington but relatively close by. If I had to guess Id say maybe Philadelphia or Baltimore. Hard to say where there would be one giant skyscraper still standing. You could walk to either of those cities in a couple days if you had to. I think the Dead Zone Jaha crossed on his journey to the city of light took him through New York City because he passed the Manhattan bridge. And he wasnt in the water long so the mansion could be like Long Island. So Im pretty sure most of the show takes place within a pretty narrow strip of our country. But in curious what the rest of the country looks like. The area around DC probably was bombed the worst. Did the rest of the country receive less damage? Does less people mean fewer survivors?

9960997,0,t1_db5wcmg,gtWhen she wrongly accused Murphy.True. That was a hotheaded illadvised move from her.gtShe didnt have a problem with Lincolns torture which didnt get them anywhere helpful.She absolutely had a problem with it. Bellamy was going to torture Lincoln before they knew that Finn had been poisoned. Bellamy said it was for information but Clarke and Octavia correctly surmised that it was for revenge and Bellamy didnt object. They were against it Clarke only went along with it afterward when Finns life was in the balance.gtBringing guns to the meeting with Anya.She was right about that though? I think it was stupid for Jasper to fire first but thats not Clarkes fault.gtBreaking out of Mt. Weather on her own instead of waiting a day or two to more fully understand the situation.What would she have done if she had more fully understood the situation? Her gut instinct here was correct they were not to be trusted. Despite warring with the Grounders I think once Clarke saw what the mountain men were doing to them she knew she would take the lesser of two evils. Monty later supports this idea.gtEntering into the alliance at Mt. WeatherWhich one? The one with LexaGrounders? They would have been killed by Grounders and never rescued their people if she hadnt done that. She was later betrayed but entering into the alliance was her only option so you cant fault her for being betrayed. She should get credit for negotiating the alliance in the first place.gtProtecting Finn after the massacre.I agree with this I think it was a failure of Clarkems character here. But at least she struggled with it privately and ultimately accepted that he needed to die in order to protect everyone. Many of the other leaders of the sky people rejected that idea and were ready to fight to the death to protect him. I think this was the start of Clarkes development into a better leader a path shes still on.gtAnd when they killed everyone in Mt. Weather.This is another of the defining moments for Clarke because its the biggest challenge to her morality. Shes always done her best to do the right thing but numberswise is it right to kill  people she doesnt know to save  she loves? Ultimately she knew they would always have to die whether she pulled the lever or whether they rescued everyone without killing the MM. Had she taken away their blood source they would have died anyway. I think she tried to ignore that aspect of it to preserve her sense of morality but eventually she gave in and admitted her actions would kill them either way and she pulled the lever.The key about all of these things is that Im not really sure what her alternative options were in any case so Im not sure how youre condemning her for being passionate and emotional other than th Murphy thing which I agree with.,The100,db5xzdc,1,t5_2x5yb

Nothing on this planet would force me to mod here unless  this was true. Doing what is best for the community means we HAVE to put an end to anything that routinely distracts from our mutual enjoyment of the show.

10084345,0,t1_dblpv9t,When you said and yet they still tried everything to stay together I couldnt think of anything they did I even recalled their scene at MW when Lexa invites Clarke to join her in Polis after the attack but Clarke replied she could only think of staying with her people she refused Lexas invitation so I thought that maybe you implied Clarke abandoned her people because she innerly wanted to reunite with Lexa?  Even though it doesnt make much sense.. How many other characters who initially misjudged Clarke have apologized and complimented Clarke after admitting their mistake? Was that in S? Well Lexa knows how to handle words same for Clarke though facts are pretty much important than words and we all know what happened at the end of S. S was about Lexas surrender to Clarke in every front since she so badly wanted to win back Clarke and Wanheda  proposed her conveniently a different way to rule where making justice wasnt just about vengeance and bloodshed. Clarke wants Lexa on the condition that her people are save Clarke rather endangers Lexas life than risking her peoples security right? In Clexa everthing is not so pink coloured therere many nuances especially from Clarkes side in S. ,The100,dbm0bsa,2,t5_2x5yb

10173956,0,t1_dbut7cu,gt I like this idea of a leader in any setting parents teachers government etc. They dont go walking around trying to or having to prove how tough they are. They know that they have hidden skills and can pull them out if needed but in the meantime they are in control of what they do.I guess...But I feel like thats also just an excuse for how the character turned out. They set up her character to seem extremely fierce and badass and I just never really felt like she was.

And Im not sure teen angst is its biggest issue. Very strong and critically acclaimed shows have teen against Homeland anyone? I think the s biggest issue is that it often tries to hard. Its extra in attempting to make its point and a little too on the nose. If they go into it expecting that I think they can still enjoy the characters and world without being too annoyed. ,The100,dc941pz,1,t5_2x5yb
10329455,0,t1_dceh44g,Great points. I was really focusing on the massacres that the Delinquents caused and totally forgot the whole Diana Sydney debacle that went completely ignored by the characters.And yeah... That comment about Mount Weather. Damn. That would have been awful. Thankfully Maya died gt If the trailers are anything to go by even if there arent any massacres there will be at least a few natural disasters that kill a bunch of people. So Im afraid that we can except more of the same.The trailer also seems to hint at a more somber tone for the season. Though that might be me just reading into things and projecting my own hopes for the season. But if its true I think that casualties caused by natural disasters can be adequately handled with keeping the tone of the show as a sort of dreary and somber.And the article at Hypable mentioned that one of the conflicts this season will be that some people actually wanted to stay in the City of Light and are quite angry that Clarke destroyed it. And I think if you combine these two somberdreary tone and people who would have rather stayed in CoL it just might be enough to address that people are dying and that people are actually grieving.But who knows for sure. ,The100,dcewgry,1,t5_2x5yb
10384835,0,t1_dcl3tgo,I think it has value because theyve written the friendship so well. Are there malefemale friends on tv that arent romantic? of course but they arent necessarily intimate or based on much more than shared mutual interests. And I agree with a lot of what you said. Specifically Bellamy being alone. Everyone always mentions Clarke but bellamy has been through just as much and now has Octavia to worry about as well. I think the writers went out of there to show that Bellamy was codependant on Clarke in S and a romantic relationship developing so soon would imo ruin the good aspects of their relationship. Bellamy needs to grow up. He needs to deal with what he has done and what has happened to him. Then maybe he will be a viable partner for Clarke or someone else. I do however think its unfair to diminish Lexa to someone Clarke had sex with. I wont get into the representation or LGBT issues but it was very obviously more than that. ,The100,dcl6ol2,5,t5_2x5yb

10519294,0,t1_dd0gbl8,gt it made her even less likeable.And less consistent. The choices she made in season  were the complete opposite of those she made in season . She willingly left Clarke to die in season because she needed the Mountain to keep the coalition she prioritized her people over Clarke as any good leader should. But in season  shes constantly doing whatever Clarke wills. All her choices revolve around Clarke... and it just didnt make sense because thats not who Lexa was shown to be in the previous season. The writers did a huge disservice to the character. ,The100,dd0h4vb,5,t5_2x5yb
10524121,0,t1_dd0g76g,Cause for some people theres none a lot of those people started to watch when they heard there was a LGBT character the same thing is now happening with Supergirl show that was pretty quiet then a few weeks ago they reveal the sister of the main character to be lesbian or bi? I dont know I dont watch it personally and boom look at all the social media attention.I think the issue is that a lot of people didnt see the difference between the Lexa of season  and season .Like just an example this scene almost everyone see that and think YEA SHES SO BADASS to me and I remember posting about that here but no one did agree with me it was showing me Lexa as a weak leader she acted purely on emotion cause she didnt get what she want like a toddler that will kick around when hes told no she kick the guy from the tower in front of all the others cause he doesnt agree with her and then people wonder why the others was plotting in her back. To me killing someone cause he disagree with you is kinda sociopath. I dont want to bring politics here but if tomorrow Trump was kicking someone of his golden tower cause the person is questioning his leadership people wouldnt call it badass they would want him in jail or executed. Anyway its maybe just me that see it that way but to me the Lexa of season  and season  were totally different same with Clarke for that matter.But I dont know if you will find your answer here here theres no shipping praise of course we do have ships but people are respectful they will just downvote you to oblivion if you dare say something bad about Lexa and the mods dont let it get out of control this is why so many people myself included love this sub cause here we can focus on the show and not just one shiprelation.For me the issue is in season  I wasnt sold to Clarke suddenly becoming bisexual because a girl kiss her plus she stopped the kiss in season  it was clear that I was wrong she is clearly bisexual I cannot deny that but the relation with Lexa was too rushed to be something I look up to I guess it wasnt built Im not saying that I dont think they loved each other but to me a relation is something you build over time while getting to know the other person everyone is in love the first few weeks of a relation but that doesnt mean its real love we all have been in love we all have been at that start of a relation thinking this was the one and here we are today probably thinking that it was ridiculous when looking back at it. For me love is not about how much you love someone the first few weeks but how much you love someone after months and years. But anyway its love we are speaking about so you wont be able get a logical answer for that. P,The100,dd10uiq,5,t5_2x5yb

10667281,0,t1_ddg7ull,They build new sets for every season like Mount Weather for S Polis for S probably a few things for S  what Im saying is if the writers feel like its necessary for the story theyll destroy everything and build new sets. I still have this theory that they wont be able to stop the apocalypse and their only hope is the  of land that will be survivable  for plot conveniences it would probably be an island or a group of islands so we dont have to worry about wandering too far and hitting radiation. Lots of people would die because of the radiation and the survivors would be the people that get on the life boats and get to the survivable land. I imagine a season  dropshipcamp style set where most of S would take place. Whatever the life boats are would take the place of the drop ship and the rest of the camp would be makeshift made of tarps and ropes etc. Grounders that come would obviously use their settlement skills to build things too. But I cant see huge expansive sets like Arkadia and Polis. So building a new set like Im imagining probably wouldnt cost like those sets did. My other S theories include there being other people on these islands who are completely different than the grounders that we know have a different language and are of course hostile. Arkadians and Coalition Grounders would have to unite and being that there wont be a lot of them that wont be that hard. Itll be like a S style trying to survive in a brand new hostile world again. I imagine these islands will have different animals and plants and be a lot different than what weve seen before. Alternately maybe these islands arent inhabited and we see more survivors going there to settle and we see a brighter more peaceful future for them. ,The100,ddg8z50,4,t5_2x5yb

I mean in a way or another Jasper always interfere negatively. He might not do it this time as you articulated it effectively or he might stick with his old self spontaneous carefree unpredictable sensitive and selfish. He might not do it on purpose but he takes a shower with drinking water because hey life is short! and oops! everyone dies of thirst.

I think we are meant to see them working a leadership unit. I dont think Clarke is necessarily in charge. She doesnt have final say. For most of them it will seem like Raven is in charge. I think it depends on who is in Arkadia. Having more people being able to step in means the others can go on missions  like Bellamy and Clarke in x leaving Raven and Abby in Arkadia.

The same applies to a Chancellor who treats its people as too stupid to take the truth lying to them both Clarke and Jaha. This is the definition of arrogance.Well I dont know in your Constitution but in mine we have not only the right but the duty to rise against our leaders when they act against the peoples will and interest. They just represent the people. Thats what is a democracy well in theory...Your comparison with a fire drill is not really valid IMO in this context because it wasnt an exercice it was supposed to be real black rain. He didnt do it on purpose but his will to die was helpful. The reason why The  is surprising you cant really say this one or this one is a prick because they all are at times as we are sometimes ourselves as well as good people except for Murphy in S. I dont know one single person on this Earth whos perfectly generous. And its something impossible to achieve because in order to survive we have to get selfish from time to time.

10953188,0,t1_de8nthe,This isnt quite how it works.Netflix doesnt pay the CW any money for shows. It pays the distribution companiesCBS and WB. Much like overseas deals Netflix pays WB a perepisode licensing fee for the length of a predetermined licensing period. Once this licensing fee and period is decided on it wont change regardless of the number of views.The CW was not designed to make money on its own the way other networks are. It is a joint venture for WBCBS to make money for themselves essentially its a first run showcase so that they can create popular shows and sell them into second runs and reap the profit.Lets take a standard network like ABC. They buy shows from various production companies and air them and hope to turn a profit from ad sales. If the show doesnt turn a profit I.E. it gets low ratings the network cant afford to continue licensing it from the production company and they have to cancel it because otherwise the network wont make any money.With the CW its a little different. Its owned by two productiondistribution companies CBS and WB. The business model is this CBS and WB sell their shows for cheap to the CW. So the ratings ad prices can be very low and the CW can afford to keep buying the shows for that very low price. WB and CBS then are losing money because theyre spending more money making the shows than they are selling them to the CW. BUT! This business model pays off in the end because once those cheap shows get to syndication or a Netflix fourth season the WBCBS can make money off of them and recoup their early losses and turn it into long term profit. The CW channel is essentially just a way to make their products look appealing for a cheap price so that they can make more money selling them to the other places later. If the WB was to sell a show directly to Netflix or SyFy it might flop and theyd lose money. If the WB was to put a show on CW for cheap get it to four seasons despite low ratings they can then present it to NetflixSyFy and say Hey look at this lovely thing! It made it to four seasons! It has an audience! How much will you give me for it?Thats how WBCBS make their money and thats why ratings dont matter as much for the CW as they do other networks. Now this doesnt mean online viewssocial mediainternational audience! Means more to the CW. Because those dont either. What matters most is production company politics and profit. If they want a show renewed because they think itll be profitable to them once it gets a fourth season it gets renewed regardless of ratings see Crazy ExGF. If they are happy with a shows profit after four seasons itll get cancelled.Then again the exceptions to this are the highly rated shows the D.C. shows. They not only make a profit for the production companies via high licensing fees for Netflixsyndication but they also make a profit for the CW view ad sales. The low rated showswhich The  is considered amongdont make a profit for the CW. Im saying this based on ad prices. The  makes less than a rd of what Flash makes. So The  is much more vulnerable to the production company politics side than it is the ratings side. ,The100,de9qrz0,2,t5_2x5yb

Aaron Ginsburg has also implied the show will deliver romantic Bellarke at some point. In that same interview he also implied Clexa would become canon and they in fact did. I no longer hold much faith in what Rothenberg says but Ginsburg didnt lie about Clexa so I imagine he wasnt lying about Bellarke.

11012853,0,t3_5x75kl,One minor quibble Personally I would say that Murphy didnt become a main character until Season . Before then he was very much a side character.But aside from that I agree with you that the show has a problem with this. But I think a big part of why this sticks out is the contrast with how the show often treats nonmain characters as expendable.Of the  named Delinquents who were not regulars in the Pilot  are either definitively or presumed dead. Every single Mount Weather character who was introduced in Season  died by the end of the season except for Emerson who only survived the season finale because they didnt have the budget to shoot his death scene and who died in the next season after only showing up in  episodes. Every major character that was introduced in Season  I dont consider either Niylah or Bryan to be major characters died by the end of the season except Luna and Roan whose fate was left up in the air because the writers were unsure about the actors availability for Season .Whats more a lot of these nonmains display what you might call antiplot armor dying in situations where they should have had at least a decent chance of living. Lexa gets randomly accidentally shot by Tydus during a botched frameup plan that makes no sense and could never have worked. Lincoln basically lets himself get captured and executed for no reason granted in this case the writers have the excuse that BTS drama with the actor may have forced lastminute changes. Ontari ends up dead because she trusts Jaha and Emori over Murphy for absolutely no reason. Emerson kills Sinclair even though he goes out of his way to capture everyone else alive. And Mayas death involves all sorts of nonsensical events the biggest two being her suits air supply inexplicably running out in maybe  hours when MW hazmat suits have repeatedly been shown to be used for far longer periods of time and Jasper and Octavia going to Level  to get her another air tank only to immediately forget about this when they arrive and not even attempt to get her another tank.Sooner or later you notice how much a characters likelihood of death depends on how highly they are billed and it cant help but take you out of the story. It feels like the show is trying to have it both ways to get anyone can die cred by killing off a large number of side characters but chickening out by rarely killing main characters.Some people in this thread say that the show would be better served if it started killing off main characters more often but I think that this problem could also be mitigated by being less triggerhappy when it comes to side characters. There are after all ways of writing characters out other than death.That being said Jaha really has no reason to be alive. He should have died either offscreen after Season  or at the end of Season . The only reason I can think of to keep him around is to show him dealing with the consequences of his City of Light but all weve gotten there is one line about accepting his sins so we can forget about that.And if they wanted Octavia to live past . they shouldnt have made the circumstances so over the top. Like someone on a podcast said the ravine was CGI so there was no reason that they couldnt have just made the drop shorter.,The100,deg9y3r,18,t5_2x5yb

The comparison to Kane here with the culling is one that is rarely cited and that he shock lashed Abby once has been essentially forgotten over time as weve seen his progression into a very moral character now  embracing grounders and arkers which weve already seen Bellamy starting to do as you noted.  I see them following a similar path with Bellamy here as he clearly has been motivated by his mistakes since midseason  and has grown.  Definitely agree with the Ark destruction being symbolic  also see it as a great setup for Bellamy to be heavily involved in keeping people alive through the black rain and end of the world from the Arkadia front while the science gurus work from Beccas lab.  ,The100,den99nf,3,t5_2x5yb

11097751,0,t1_depv02t,I suppose but idk is that not kind of beating a dead horse at this point? Bellamy deeply regrets his actions Bellamy knows his actions were wrong Bellamy is more than aware that they need to work with the grounders to achieve peace and since the end of last season has demonstrated an ability to understand that clan loyalty means nothing in the face of impending doom x he tells Roan that ALIE doesnt care what clan youre from in x he tells Echo that the radiation doesnt care what clan youre from. Bellamy KNOWS he was wrong and is actively showing that he can see the grounders should not be viewed as an other or be perceived as evil. We saw this in x when he chose  primarily grounder slaves over saving his own people. Not even Clarke and her transcending tribalism nature would have done that. I just dont understand why we have to have the character of Echo act as a dark mirror of Bellamys personality to remind the audience again that Bellamy knows he was wrong. It just feels like an extended piece to his redemption arc which really should be wrapping up soon.  Im just failing to see what hes getting out of this interaction so far. Perhaps once it develops more I will get it but were almost half way through the season and Id be impressed if Echo makes it to s. Im hoping I see the purpose of the interactions soon because so far Im really not grasping the intention of the scenes beyond look! Bellamy is different now!

Ive said it before but when you are an oldest sibling forced to parent your younger siblings andor a parent yourself I happen to be both it is totally easy to understand Bellamy as a character.  Other than the mishap with Pike last season which had more to do with cutting important scenes to help take us from point A to point B where he follows Pike then it did with the storyline itself I do feel like the writers and Bob have really nailed this character and his personality.  There is a particular personality trait in older siblings that have gone through this dynamic that I can relate to which is being a bit of a control freak.  That is where the savior complex comes into play.  You have spent your whole life fixing problems being the person to take control raise your siblings and basically being the one to take responsibility.  You think you can fix everything because you were the one to fix everything...up until you get to the point where you cant fix something...which is when those kidssiblings become adults and they have to take the reins themselves.  Letting go of control is not easy when you have spent your whole life being the fixer.   ,The100,dfbj9h0,29,t5_2x5yb

Especially this year they seem to be more invested in the title opener just a small example of them adding the space scene but weve only seen that once... right?

11339683,0,t1_dfgao1x,gtSure Niylah isnt expecting anything but it seems they are alluding that Clarke might be. That is the issue I have especially given what happens in the same scene. Plus with Lexa dying so close to everything that has happened.I didnt read it that way. Im not saying that it cant happen but I felt like she just wanted her to be safe and that she would have said the same thing to any of her other friends. gtSure there is nothing wrong with them wanting to have sex with whoever. The relationship aspect does matter a fuck load considering the implication of what we are to believed they lost. You cant say youre devastated and then two days later in another committed relationship. It doesnt make sense and honestly is bad writing.Im not saying Clarke needs  romantic relationships over the course of one season or even one Im just saying that if it does happen it doesnt have to mean she didnt care about Lexa. Im saying that in a crisis emotions are heightened and feelings develop faster things are said sooner etc. and I think Clarkes past relationships are proof of that or at least this is the only way I can rationalize them. The  have been earth for like five months IIRC and she was able to get romantically involved with two people. Season  was around  days season  was around  days so you can argue that she knew each of them for a month each maybe less for Lexa if you count when she and Lexa actually met. Im not sure how long it has passed since season  exactly but blockpro is right theyve been on several long journeys and they spent some time repairing the Ark. So were looking at least a month maybe more.Clarke isnt going to college her SO isnt moving in with her I dont count Clarke letting Niylah stay in her room so that she doesnt get killed by radiation moving in the only life goals theyd be sharing is survival and there wont be any kids or white picket fences etc. so these are far from normal committed relationships. So basically what Im saying is that putting a minimummovingonday limit is just as unrealistic as declaring her love for Niylah next episode. Which like I said is unlikely imo anyway. gtNot that they have sex with some people and now their troubles are a little bit less. I cant accept that.Stress relief. Sex is not some magical cure. Theyre still hurting and I havent seen anything on the show that indicated otherwise. Octavia for one actually said the words Just make me feel something else keyword something else. And Clarke she not only looked at a picture of Lexa but Niylah mentioned her like twice  I think Roan mentioned her twice Clarke mentioned her to Abby even Emori mentioned her last episode. That is a lot more than Finn got. ,The100,dfhc0do,4,t5_2x5yb

11400714,0,t3_62olmz,Im sure the show isnt for everyone so if you dont enjoy it why not watch something you do like? But for me I like the show much better when I can bingewatch several episodes in a row. If youre into the story but low on patience maybe wait until the end of the season for it to be on netflix. Someone else can confirm but Im pretty sure the CW has an agreement that will have all the episodes up like a week after it finishes right??I mean Id consider myself a diehard fan but even when I beg my friends to watch it I lay off when they get past a certain point and arent hooked.

11410936,0,t1_dfperel,Did you ever hear the tragedy of Chancellor Diana the wise? I thought not. Its not a story the Council would tell you. Its a Skaikru legend. Chancellor Diana was a Member of the Arks council under Chancellor Jaha so powerful and so wise she could use the charisma to influence the arks blue collar workers to save their own lives.... She had such a knowledge of the order exodus that she could even keep the ones she cared about from dying. The technology in the Ark is a pathway to powers some might consider unnatural. She became so powerful... the only thing she was afraid of was the exodus ship losing its power which eventually of course it did. Unfortunately she taught his apprentice everything she knew then his apprentice watched her die from the Ark when the mountain men blocked the exodus ships signals. Its ironic she could save others from death but not herself. ... Or did she?,The100,dfpf1am,19,t5_2x5yb

11583414,0,t3_65b5yf,TV shows never are very realistic. The Ark is selfsustainable and thats why you should assume that makeup are not necessarily a missing thing. Sure in a more realistic way you would have no makeup overused clothes probably some people dying of hunger etc .. But a TV show has to be somewhat attractive and for that realism has to be put aside on a few things.Character personalities arent visible in the first episode except maybe for Octavia because we get a bit of backstory it will develop over time x x x if I remember correctly are the episodes that shows a lot of backstorytldr the show is great dont get discouraged by the Pilot pilots never are great because theyre not filmed at the same time as the rest of the season I think .. so theres sometimes a few inconsistency.,The100,dg8zjec,9,t5_2x5yb
11664084,0,t3_66enmy,I agree united the krus are stronger and how you explain it. And Lexa making all of them follow the coalition is her greatest achievement and the greatest achievement in the postapocalyptic society  as far as we know.I disagree on your views of the former commanders. Some commanders arent interested in greater coalitions only their own kru or few others most were too weak  just my humble opinion. And with every new commander the political landscape changed dramatically. A lot of different coalitions in all this years.The tribes werent interested in coalitions and sharing their resources like you say. But having the chance one of them becoming the commander and therefore rule Polis makes them participating in the conclave. Polis being neutral but rich because of Becca.,The100,dgi50cr,2,t5_2x5yb

11695723,0,t1_dgliegi,Perhaps I didnt word what I meant the most clearly. I used to go all out on ships and what would happen is I would find myself seeing a show through shipper goggles. Suddenly anything that didnt apply to my ship was not interesting anyone that came between my ship I was skewed toward disliking before they even had a chance and my desires for the show became tangled up in my hopes for the ship. This nearly ruined some shows for me. And honestly it made me want to participate in ship wars. What a waste of time bickering back and forth with strangers when we were both probably wearing those damn goggles. Alas I have grown up a lot and dont really see the point. This fandom has a really nasty war going on. I backed out of fandom during season  to avoid being roped into all the negativity. It was probably a good idea too. I imagine things were bad for a while. On both sides. It seems by now that some things have died down but then again who knows. Im sure many viewers from one half the fandom have moved on to other shows. I didnt mention my ships by name because I know as soon as I do people will put me in a box. And honestly I dont want to get pulled back in to all the fighting. But that being said I always liked Octavia and Lincoln. I wouldnt say I shipped them but I did enjoy their scenes together. I liked how Lincoln gave Octavia a sense of home. She never fully felt like a Sky Person and she just wanted desperately to be like him. It was sweet. That being said I also had a lot of problems with them. He was at least  years her senior and she was very young. Lincoln never got as much development as I would have liked. I always wanted more out of him. How did he become a warrior? How did he know Luna? So many questions left unanswered. Octavia meanwhile never really molded an identity uniquely her own. Shes been on a quest for so long to find her tribe and she keeps failing. My heart breaks for the poor  year old in the floorboards. She was doomed from the start. The other ship I thought enhanced the show was Lexa and Clarke. They were in my opinion one of the best written relationships romantic or not on the show in general. They grew individually alongside each other and helped make each other better. The acting the lighting the directing the music overlay etc all can together damn near perfectly during those season three scenes. Chemistry is all opinion so I know plenty of people will disagree but I felt they had the best chemistry on the show except maybe the unintentional chemistry between season  Abby and Raven. I think had ADC not been cast in Fear the Walking Dead season  as a whole would have been way more concise and well received. Jason had a vision and he had to alter it to give Lexa a send off he didnt plan or want. I found season  as a result to be the most inconsistent season. There were amazing episodes or scenes followed by terrible ones. I think it took most the season for the writers to get back on track. But alas those are my opinions. Most my favorite relationships are not romantic at all. I like family bonds and definitely the idea of chosen family. Raven and Murphy would be an interesting dynamic. I could get behind it if the writers do take it there. I just want sweet baby Raven happy. ,The100,dglq8ox,1,t5_2x5yb

11787905,0,t3_6866mr,I feel like the issues people had with the beginning of Season  should ward them off from doing another time jump  but what the writers should do has never stopped them from doing what they want to do anyway for better or worse. Personally I think this bunker situation needs to have some crazy twist or else its gonna feel too straightforward for the show at this point. Either they dont use it they dont need it or theres something inside that theyre now trapped with. With these ideas I dont think you need a time jump. Its interesting enough to see the aftermath. If its a regular old bunker with no crazy twist and they have to stay there for  years... I feel like theyd need to do a time jump to get to a more interesting storytelling point for The . Youre not gonna give us  seasons of drastic kill or be killed intensity and then follow up with a nice albeit claustrophobic drama where people are safe and sound but always yelling at each other about being hungry.,The100,dgw75jr,10,t5_2x5yb
