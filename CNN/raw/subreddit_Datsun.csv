I can see your concern.Are we talking about the sprint car kind of look where the tires are sitting outside the fenders? Or are we talking about trying to cram the  wide tire under the stock fender? I suppose with the coilovers you can jack up the rear a bit to fit the tires and give it that forward rake look and those would fit but Im pretty sure if you are trying to fit it under the car the tire or rim is going to be hitting where that stock spring perch is.,Datsun,cxsbxvj,1,t5_2smge

If those are gone you are going to have a LOT of issues fixing this otherwise its doable but super expensive.The other big thing to consider is if you can do the body work yourself or are you going to have to hire a shop. If you have to hire a shop to do it you need to find out if any in your area will actually do it a problem around where I am. You can often find show car restoration places but they charge an absurd amount of money usually compared to smaller places.
