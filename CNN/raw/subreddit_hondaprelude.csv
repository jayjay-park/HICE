6643839,0,t1_d05xywu,I was in agreement for like the first two sentences  then you earned a downvote because theres not any factual information after that and worse misinformation.There is nothing thin weak or otherwise wrong with the Hs cylinder walls rings or ring lands.  FRM  is the material used in the Hs cylinder walls which is also used by porsche in their cylinder walls.  Its a reinforcement material that provides extra strength in the cylinder wall which allows the block to be lighter.  Its actually stronger material than most dry sleeves but the problem is that forged pistons are not compatible with FRM therefore they cannot be used.You can rather easily make  over stock but you need forged internals to deal with the heat at that power level. If you want to stay stock block you CAN turbocharge a stock block H you just have to understand the limits of what the cast internals can take as well as make sure you provide adequate crankcase ventilation.The automatic transmission in the th gen prelude is literally a heap of worthless shit.  Regardless of whether the car remains stock or not.Youre completley wrong on cost youre going to need quite a bit more than k to make any substantial power on an h.  Id say double that number and you might scratch the surface.And youre probably right.  The IRA is a better investment.  If youre banking your retirement on a HP Honda Prelude... thats probably not gonna work too well for you... But some of us like to have fun.,hondaprelude,d06j3ud,4,t5_2xjxg
