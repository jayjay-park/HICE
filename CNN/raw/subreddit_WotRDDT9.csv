2895606,0,t1_cnx7xz3,Dont worry rational we all have jobs and lives which can take us away for a bit... Thats all just part of life youre not about to get kicked for inactivity because you missed a week D Just make sure youve participated in the straw poll above. Id like to run t stronks again at least once a week as its kinda like a man platoon and always a good laugh. Itll give some of us the chance to practice calling its useful that everyone calls once in a while for their own gameplay and for everyone else to listen to callers in a low charged competitive atmosphere not to mention we can get some creditxp boost rewards that we can activate for the clan... ,WotRDDT9,cnx8g6i,1,t5_34a4c
3484528,0,t1_cppa07e,At the top of almost every CW or SH list is the Object . Mobility DPM bouncy turret. The Obj  has lower terrain resist higher DPM higher camo but less specific power less accurate gun less  HP less weight for that RAMMAGE than the E M. So why the Object ? It has to be that turret theres no way youre going hull down in the E M. The E M turret face is soft and even though it has  more HP it wont matter if its getting penned consistently. The higher camo value also helps the Object  vs. E M with  crew. The E M will be out spot sitting still by m compared to the . Even though the stats say otherwise I think theres some skewing due to how many shitters fail their way up to the Object . Pubbies win more do more damage in the E M but the  is still prized more in the hands of a capable tanker regarding stronks tourneys clan wars and WGLNA matches.,WotRDDT9,cppgm4t,1,t5_34a4c
