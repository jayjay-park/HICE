The Kale BazetsnDoina book has a lot of good tools for putting phrases together and I think the Compleat Klezmer has some good doina transcriptions as well but I would supplement that as much as possible by going to recordings and hearing how the players are doing it. This process will be helped immensely by studying the modes used in Klezmer see another recent topic as many of these runs keep pretty strictly to the modes with a few chromatic ornaments or transition passages thrown in  if you are a jazz player though the use of these will probably be familiar...,klezmer,cplyw34,2,t5_2sm7t
