182592,0,t1_ceyudy0,I dont think it makes you an asshole. I do disagree however and would like to know how cheating on your partner of  years would not have emotional ramification for you as a person even if your partner never found out.I have cheated before and told and not told. Holding in the truth the guilt and the shame by not telling was way worse punishment than the actual cheating. The memory of the sexkissing faded.

226890,0,t3_1wp9hw,OK please dont take my story too seriously but Ive been in this situation. I was with a guy for over  years and he was in love with another girl the whole time. I actually got really close to the girl then they hooked up a couple of times behind my back. Like an idiot I stayed with him but forbade him to see her and cut ties with her. Eventually I missed her so I let her back in our lives. I couldnt control the jealousy and we broke up. Guess who he started dating immediately after? It didnt work out though she broke up with him because she valued my friendship more than him so she broke his heart for me hehe. For the record were all on speakingfriendly terms and the girl is still my best friend so it all worked out in the end but the cheating was the hardest thing Ive ever gone through. If anything happens just walk away. Hes not worth your time.,entwives,cf49j5x,3,t5_2s7a6

561053,0,t3_20jvqp,I just moved across the country in my car last October. Indiana to San Jose CA. Definitely try to find work before you leave. Its super easy to find jobs online. I used job boards like Indeed.com and Bright.com who was just bought by LinkedIn so I dont know if theyre still up. But theres also Craigslist stuff etc.I was able to couch surf my way across the country which was nice but I ended up taking a longer trip. Honestly rent a car with decent gas mileage pack up the things you cant live without and head out. If you can stand sleeping on an air mattress for a while maybe try that route. If your family would still pay for your last year of college out in CO maybe transfer. Being a student opens up so many resources for you. Best of luck getting out of that situation.

988426,0,t3_25dss1,Long story but similar I had a roommate bring her evicted friend in for the last few months of the lease. This friend came with two cats one a kitten and two rats  in a strictly No Pets Allowed rental. Roommate had previously begged the landlord to let her keep a puppy. She was denied but kept the dog for six months anyway  of course puppy scratches holes in the drywall and eats the molding by the carpets. The friend dumped all her stuff animals included in the living room and worked two jobs the majority of the day and slept at her boyfriends house somewhere else. She fed the rats and cats dog food couldnt afford litter and never cleaned up after the animals. One rat was so unsocialized he tried to bite through my finger when I went to play with him. The cats were stressed as fuck puked all over the carpets and started using the sinks as litter boxes because theirs was full. Me and my boyfriend took care of them for weeks all the while trying to convey messages to the friend through my roommate that she was abusing her animals and needed to find good homes for them. Girl decided she was going to move into a No Pets apartment and give the animals to her mom but her mom would only take one cat. After never hearing from this girl again moveout day comes. Landlord walks in WITH THE NEW TENANTS no idea why we still had the day to finish cleaning and the house is disgusting. Roommate and evicted friends stuff filled a room and a living room there and landlord was furious about the animals. No deposits back for anyone.My boyfriend and I had been caring for the animals at least two months with literally no sightings of their owner and we had to leave knowing the animals had no home and having floated the idea of adopting them to her once. We walked out with the kitten and a rat Helga the rat died of cancer within six months pretty normal but the other rat just couldnt be rehomed unfortunately I think he was just released into the wild. This is why I now have three cats who took two years to stop being territorial at each other  wed signed up to adopt two cats already before all this but that girl did not deserve to be allowed animals.Advice for you since you cant keep the cat please help it. Im glad your roommate actually shows up occasionally and is willing to talk about all this and youve already gone above and beyond by caring for her animal. The poor kitty is definitely stressed though and deserves a good home. Just thought Id share my nightmare here though admittedly a nightmare with the result of a fantastic super fluffy family addition!,entwives,chgn3p9,2,t5_2s7a6

4151407,0,t3_385h1n,So this is advice for any situation where you dont yet feel like you fit in.....Lets first take a step back. When you get home your partner has already been home and had time to unwind where you have not. What do you do to feel better after work? Change your clothes maybe take off makeup? I bet you have a routine we all do. This is theirs yours is yours. In the end you should both end up happy and relaxed with just yourself......do whatever you need to do to get there.Now that both of you are relaxed with yourselves you can look at each other. In your case your partners energy level is much higher then yours so open up to feed off of it. You wont get as high as they are but if you allow yourself to catch their laughter and be infected with their extra happiness you will in term get a rush and adrenaline high from the interaction.Right now you walk in the door on the defensive. Tomorrow walk in ignore and settle yourself first. Prep the SO that you want to try out an experiment when you get home to see if it helps you relax ask them not to talk with you until you come to them. Once you are settled go in and kiss them and join the laughter.It could be a fun experiment to ask your SO to use drops to see if you have a more positive reaction to them when you dont see blood shot eyes. Visual turn offs can screw with us somethings maybe that is just a trigger for you?,entwives,crth2zu,4,t5_2s7a6

Take good look at why you want something and if its true to the right path you want to take.The third and final card is the Three of Pentacles. This card is suggesting that you already have the skills and knowledge to make a path for yourself. I believe the tarot is saying to take a good look at any hobbies or interests that might help you?I think the jest of This spread  is to wait and work with your current skills before trying to changes things up.,entwives,d1dxgyb,2,t5_2s7a6

7042087,0,t1_d1egudz,I joke that four cats is crazy cat lady territory but I wouldnt have it any other way. I adore them. Mulder is an old lady now we were told she was a boy when we got her and she came from a craigslist ad. Later came Nibs  we got her from a shelter. She had been there the longest. Chloe came from my SIL who rescued her from some stables where she was mistreated and neardeath. And Abby  my friends SIL had found some abandoned kittens before their eyes were open. At  weeks her husband insisted the kittens had to go. I couldnt resist so I took one the other three also found homes the same day. I tell my husband we need a bigger house so I can have more cats.,entwives,d1ekt33,2,t5_2s7a6

7292539,0,t3_4f9efc,Oh yes definitely. Actually the uncomfortable hyperaware headspace caused me to entirely give weed up for roughly two years. As a fellow GAD haver I was really apprehensive about coming back to smoking. Luckily I live in CA so I get to find and try out different strains. Recently I found one I really enjoy. However I rarely smoke fat. I take one or two little tokes from my teenytinypipe and gauge the high before continuing further. Edibles are something I avoid entirely because it always ends in tears. When I do feel uncomfortably high I turn to movement. I hop on my yoga mat and focus on gentle stretching and breathing. Or I grab my hula hoop and dance it out. OR I bike ride. Physically dealing with my anxiety helps loads. So yeah I definitely freak out sometimes but its all about finding that middle ground ,entwives,d2742hd,3,t5_2s7a6

I really want to let him in because I feel guarded and like there is this part of my life he doesnt know about but Im really scared of him not responding well or leaving me because of it mostly because I know these things will make my anxiety so much worse. So even if that does mean hes not the guy for me I still have to deal with potentially worse anxiety if he leaves because of it. Also I think part of it is that we dated and then he broke up with me for a few months and we started getting back together in Dec. but not the point of being bfgf yet so I dont know if I should wait and see if things get more stable before talking to him about it.,entwives,d2j9z4q,1,t5_2s7a6

8261736,0,t3_4sieh4,I have a few irrational fears. One major one which I have nightmares about is drowning while in a car. Like driving off a bridge and drowning in the car. I am not really that scared of drowning because I am a pretty good swimmer I was a lifeguard for  years. I was on swim team for  years. I can tread water for a long time. But being stuck in a car that is sinking scares the crap out of me. I am terrified of spiders. I really like them I know that they eat mosquitoes and other bad bugs. But I dont want one in the house or on me. I try to capture and release. I dont want to kill them.My dream house is like my brother in laws house. They have a wide open floor plan lots of windows lots of sunlight. Its not that far from a city but they have a big front and back yard. Lots of trees. Privacy. A huge wrap around porch. A hot tub. I try not to have too many regrets. I have made a lot of mistakes in my life but I am right where I need to be. I dont regret loving people as deeply and as hard as I have. Some people say the word love is thrown around too much too flippantly. But I think love is the most important thing and more love is the only way to make things better. To make people better. Love the broken things. ,entwives,d5a9ww0,1,t5_2s7a6

You have made good choices and will continue to do so!  Remember that he is not part of your life anymore and you dont have to deal with him.  Hugs again because it is super hard to confront yourself in these moments.  What you feel is weakness is just your brain and body reminding you that some things are absolutely not worth repeating.

9231711,0,t3_56spbd,Aw that is just the worst. Its so hard to let go of control and just sit back letting life unfold. Its natural to feel helpless but its good to know you are extremely healthy mentally and can completely handle this. A couple of months ago my childhood dog died Im almost  and that was really hard to deal with. It was probably harder on my mom since she was the only one living with the dog. However I would guess that youll feel slight relief once the situation is dealth with. No more prolonging feelings of any kind. But to be honest I adopted my fiancee and I a dog last September and she is my entire world. Besides the fiancee of course. And I had the realization yesterday that she might not even get to meet our first born child not currently expecting. The dog is not even  yet but I cant imagine going throughout the day without her. She needs her morning afternoon and evening cuddles. She needs to play some serious fetch  times a day... I just cant imagine a life that didnt revolve around her needs. I know this doesnt help your situation except to know that you are not alone in your feelings. Pets become intense parts of our lives. Ill definitely appreciate the annoying whines thanks to you you helped me be more grateful today and for that I thank you!,entwives,d8m6qoz,5,t5_2s7a6

9324420,0,t3_584kxd,I was trying to respond sooner but alas. I got tossed into a fucking shit storm at work for no reason. Gosh. I cant. I just cant. Im at my breaking point. For real. Id like to think Ive changed. Im definitely better at talking to people than I used to be though I do still struggle with crippling shyness and codependency. I used to be the voice of optimism and I feel like Im maybe not as positive as I used to be. I definitely feel really world weary and grouchy most days recently. I think I used to be better at listening and now Im opinionated and learned enough to be forcefull with my words. Although sometimes it causes me more problems than its worth so usually I just shut up and keep to myself. Um. My relationship with my body is better but I still spend most of my time beating myself up and not feeling good enough. This isnt helped by my current work environment where one person in particular is trying to beat me into my position and not letting me exercise my power. I feel like if the decision had been made by my counterpart it wouldnt have been an issue and yeah Im going to say it I DO think its because I have a vagina. The more time that goes on Im convinced this dude likes to be in the dominant position and cant handle that I could run shit instead of him. IN FACT. The only reason I didnt get picked for his position is because it would have required extra training since I open and not close. SO FUCK YOU ASS MANAGER. Sorry that turned into a way different post than was meant to be. I used to be a lot nicer. But still to this day am struggling with a balance of not getting taken advantage of standing up for myself and being patient with everyone. ,entwives,d8xxtdy,2,t5_2s7a6

9603229,0,t1_d9v8zmm,This is a great comment so Im piggybacking. Ive done shrooms a decent amount the past five years and theyve all been fantastic experiences. Things that made them all great imo I would try not to eat most of the day beforehand so you can eat less and feel more. Particularly dairy. Apparently it can neutralize the effects. Plus sometimes shrooms make me a bit nauseous so an empty stomach makes me feel better.  I started low like  g. I am not petite. Youll feel it and have a good time. Dont feel you need to take twice as much as people recommend. After a few hours when Im mostly done Ill smoke a bit and it keeps me mellow. Dont start in the dark. I like to give myself hours to enjoy it and its better to have a bright outside to stare at. It also kept my mood up the first few times so I didnt get all nervous or paranoid because I definitely was already a bit nervous trying a new drug for the first time. Set up lots of playlists for YouTube or speakers or something. Its no fun trying to search for things or thing while youre tripping but Ive found I REALLY want to experience music or Carl Sagan or something while on shrooms so I try to make sure I have options handy. When my husband and I first started feeling it last time we wanted to watch Carl Sagan and it would have been Awesome but I just couldnt handle getting it all set up. Commercials are NOT FUN on shrooms during music at least for me so I recommend playlists or a free trial of an adfree site or something. I also only do it with people also doing it. By myself I feel like I have to babysit the whole time or not be a dope and thats no fun. I know lots of people love being out in nature or walking around but I get too in my head. Be careful whatever you decide but Id suggest planning to stay inside and not stress about it your first time. Last time was the most crazy vision stuff I had ever seen and it was so great because everything in my house was bright but door was locked and phone off and I just tripped seeing cool things and feeling great. I danced to music stared out the window and saw cool stuff stared at an oil painting and kept seeing new things. I hope yall get that experience too! Be safe.Edit Actually the first time I made edibles I had WAY too much. It was actually kinda a fun experience where I watched Ghost in the Shell and was just sobbing to my husband about a sad episode and he held me while I cried. I know that sounds no fun but it was literally  min of intense and then I was like emotionally clean the rest of the night. Like wiped out and light. And sometimes I can feel that way with shrooms. But otherwise theyre not too alike. Emotionally intense can definitely happen with both though.,entwives,d9wslzq,2,t5_2s7a6

I was in Vegas and it was a complete nightmare.  Had I been somewhere that I was comfortable like at home I think I would have been much better.  Not to mention that I really had no idea how much differently it affected you when ingested.  My husband and I had planned a weedcation to Denver and I was scared to go because I was so about all of the options and availability.

9780659,0,t3_5ey4ee,I did edibles with my Ent an old dope fiend and had a really bad reaction. He related it to dropping acid it was so strong. Probably superhigh THC and more on the Indica side as I didnt panic out and Im prone to panic attacks but was just really REALLY trippin hard. In a restaurant. I was paralyzed. I got food but could not eat much. I am epileptic and there was an overhead fan cutting the light to pieces like a strobe making me preseizure. I sat in the booth for about  hours either looking down or eating and drinking my coffee with my eyes closed. My Ent just kept talking gently to me handfeeding me a bit telling me we would be OK nothing bad was happening just a bit more juice than I was used to. I was not a seasoned smoker. It was also nice that the diner was a sortof freakshow itself and I was probably the mildest thing they had seen that day. They were very kind even gave my Ent free dessert. So that made me feel much safer than if I had started tripping on the bus.  After that no more edibles for me. Also Benadryl helped me a lot later that night.

Once you feel well enough start doing little things for yourself. Get quality time in with your or a friends pets. Play sad music and cry until you dont have any crying left for the day or hour. Cook yourself up healthy and delicious food. Go for a walk if the weather is nice if not have a nice long bath with candles and oils and such. Eat lots of chocolate.

When we first started we had a hard time keeping our temps low because it was so hot and no cooling system or ventilation in the room really. We are lucky those babies were so resilient.

11478947,0,t3_63r85z,I can relate but my events were so long ago.  Consider this logic have you ever done other regrettable things in your life of a non sexual nature?  Unless you are some kind of special human I am sure you did.  Do you beat yourself up over those things?  If not why should sex be special?I am an older Redditor  mid s.  Been around the block sexually.  Dont put sex on such a pedestal that anything you do wrong in this area is somehow WORSE than anything else.  Its not.  In fact the older I get the more I see how Mother Nature just wants babies so bad to continue the species she will have us spreading our legs for just about anybody once our inhibitions are lowered or if we are unsure but go ahead anyway.  Mother Nature through sex is such a powerful force MOST of us cant resist her from time to time.There are SO MANY mistakes one can make in life fucking  the wrong person gets lower and lower on my list of mistakes the older I get. I hope this mature perspective helps you a little.,entwives,dfx4vfc,6,t5_2s7a6
