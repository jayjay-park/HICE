3360571,0,t3_2y2bfh,Im kinda new to rifftrax stuff been a fan of mstk for years though. Im kinda confused about these live shows. Is it the same jokes that they have on the non live riffs? Like I have already seen their The Room riff so will the live show just be the same?,Rifftrax,cpbbvwk,1,t5_2rmto

4501203,0,t3_3cpuu1,Also keep in mind that they do an encore on Tuesday for every new Rifftrax Live its usually in fewer theaters for that. But you always get two chances to catch it in theaters.,Rifftrax,csy135b,2,t5_2rmto
5275046,0,t3_3n85xo,It has to be much harder to riff a selfaware movie like Sharknado than it is a gem like Miami Connection.  ,Rifftrax,cvly3rk,7,t5_2rmto
