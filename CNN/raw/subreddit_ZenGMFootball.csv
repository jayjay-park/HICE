1840137,0,t3_2fkjhj,Since nobody else has mentioned anything if you want to increase your running game you can alway limit the number of Receivers starting.So QB RB TE WR OL will probably give you more plays for the run compared to QB RB TE WR OL.Part of it is mix of passrun plays. Other part is effectiveness of passing and running. The st above will get you a more run focused team. The second a more pass focused. However your quality and depth at RBOL or WRQB will give you an idea of how efficient you can be in those offenses.Try starting  RB and have two strong back up RB on the bench to keep your starters fresh but your offense still run focused. You will probably have a strong running team.,ZenGMFootball,ckaxlnj,1,t5_325ms
1842141,0,t1_ckaynpn,Exploiting this is a large part of my strategy when I play. I like the fact that by being patient and skipping the A free agents you can usually get great value on some B level guys.Also if you do this a lot youll find that there simply doesnt exist that much extra value to be had. The first few season of a new league this works great but after that you almost never are able to grab a star this way. I think this hidden cheat is largely just created by the fact that lots of new players are generated randomly when you start a league and so have pot age and contracts not realistically in line with how the game actually plays. So it really isnt that big a problem down the line.,ZenGMFootball,ckb6ake,2,t5_325ms
