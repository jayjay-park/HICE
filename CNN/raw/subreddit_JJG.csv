Ill just see how much it bothers me and possibly reinstall at some point.Im admittedly running on quite low settings but I havent noticed that with the game installed on my HDD yet. gt Id like to know how that social club thing is. Since I didnt install the game via steam I wont be able to join lobbys from there.Im not sure what the Steam integration is like but everything onlinerelated is based around Social Club so you can see your RSC friends list ingame see if theyre playing offline or online join their lobbies etc. I havent had time to check out GTA Online myself but the Social Club functionalityintegration seems decent enough from what Ive seen so far.,JJG,cqcypn4,1,t5_37sf6
