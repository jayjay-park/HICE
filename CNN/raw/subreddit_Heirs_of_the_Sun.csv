6785045,0,t3_48p1gb,What it takes to achieve such discipline is the willingness to fail. We have to get out of our comfort zones and find the willingness to travel down the rabbit hole of facing why we dislike getting uncomfortable.Indeed we must fall down if were going to learn. We must get hit if were going to learn to defend ourselves literally and figuratively. Today make that choice to try something uncomfortable. Tomorrow try it again and you will see with every step that it is the willingness to get uncomfortable that creates true comfort. The doorway to growth change peace and success is failure. You have to get broken down to build back up.,Heirs_of_the_Sun,d0lddht,3,t5_3cb87

6809053,0,t3_490bv2,The truly confident person is the most humble. He knows he is learning from everyone around him all of life is his teacher. Feel good feel confident and know you are limitless. But know that you are beyond certain things now not above them. You are stronger and in turn able to help more people. By performing time here and helping others you can use that confidence for good. The greatest soul doesnt judge always loves speaks wisely and learns from everyone. This is what the saints do. ,Heirs_of_the_Sun,d0o3pkf,6,t5_3cb87

7079112,0,t1_d1ikc8d,I think I see both points. From a technical amp physiological standpoint sunshine is correct. Neural pathways in the brain can be modified by the experiences of regularly watching porn so much so that the brains of excessive porn users resemble those of drug addicts. Basically the dopamine reward system in the brain is damaged and neuropathways have been rewired. Its safe to call such a person an addict. I see SolidStances post as the perspective of someone who sees the root cause  the decision making process. I dont think I can keep calling myself an addict no matter how technically true and expect to break the addiction. An addict is by definition still addicted. They will return to the addiction thats what makes them an addict. The addict and the addiction are connected.In deciding to break the addiction I may technically have a brain which resembles that of an addict but I am no long an addict because I made the decision not to return to the addiction. To me the word instinct brings to mind a behavior which cannot be helped. A behavior which is hardwired. But the brain is not hardwired as it was once believed. It is neuroplastic. I can modify certain wiring with my behavior. Rewiring is difficult because chemical cravings still exist and can even cause physical withdrawal symptoms. But I am not an addict above and apart from my own decisions to access the addiction and vice versa. I decided to no longer return to the addiction and so I am no longer an addict. All my opinion not trying to put words in anyones mouth or offend. Take or leave please. ,Heirs_of_the_Sun,d1is67m,3,t5_3cb87
