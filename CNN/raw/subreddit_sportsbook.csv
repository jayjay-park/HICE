62438,0,t1_celgy8s,Just throwing this out there Im pretty sure Indiana NBA wouldve been a PotD yesterday if we had went strictly on upvotes.  Of course it wouldve swapped with Chicago NHL and ultimately wouldve been a wash but still.  In regard to the participation I most likely wont be putting a vote on anything besides NBA even though there might be a good argument for a pick because I havent done the research independently.  Something Ive been thinking about too is that due to the structure of this type of thread theres gonna be times when the pick is shit relative to other days.  Some days I see a bunch of good bets some days I see none.  A successful bettor will not force picks just cause they want action which ultimately is what this thread does no ones fault just the nature of the field.  ,sportsbook,celje6z,2,t5_2s3v4

Rule I keep most bets under  of my bankroll and the only times I go larger up to  are when I can mathematically demonstrate that I have a significant edge Rule track as much of what you do as possible at a minimum know where all your money is at any moment.aAgreat bet as determined by ones gut or even a very detailed system is never an example of such a bet one example I had this season was a bet that the the AFC  seed would have at least  wins at a time when  teams were  naive assumptions give this  likelihood but I was getting  and less naive analysis only helped my case.,sportsbook,cetqruc,1,t5_2s3v4

147357,0,t3_1vqgsp, I like Boise . at New Mexico. Boise is the better team overall and matches up better. They are in the th percentile in their dependence on three pointers PT ATT Total ATT while UNM is in the nd percentile in allowing them. This means that Boise is going to have a lot of good looks from three. They are in the th percentile in PT so I expect them to shoot well. I assigned six points for UNMs home advantage to be conservative and even with that Boise has a . probability of covering. I have the fair value of this game at UNM . a win probability favoring UNM  and a predicted score of  UNM.  As for the other games they are more or less fairly priced. The SMU game is tempting because they match up extremely well against Rutgers but this will be SMUs third game in four nights. So be cautious. Harvard is also attractive but betting on a double digit road favorite is always a dubious prospect. ,sportsbook,cev7qx1,4,t5_2s3v4

Bucks will also be missing  Sanders Udoh and possibly Henson leaving their frontcourt very thin for a tough matchup against Vucevic. Even if Henson does play its likely he will be eased back after coming back from a foot and ankle injury.To top it off Bucks are arguably the worst team in the league along with Philly and seem to be tanking for a lotto pick. Magic arent great either but they are more talented and are trending in the right direction. Fading Milwaukee here.EDIT Orlando is the worst road team in the league  but I dont see that really coming into play as the Bucks are  on their home court.

Playing large boards is a recipe for disaster but I absolutely love todays board so Im taking a bunch of games.Too late for Illinois KState Maryland but some of the later games more detailBuffalo . IPFW was my favorite underdog Buffalo is my favorite favorite. I quickly learned to trust in this team no matter what the spread was when I shied away because  I didnt like it they covered anyway. I love today because they play against a team who played last night and they are just a better team and it is only small chalk.Akron .. Similar reasoning to Buffalo above but I dont have unwavering faith in them like I do Buffalo. Still the situation is right for them to win.Texas . One of those teams that struggled away from home this year but they are just a much better team than West Virginia. I think they take care of business here.Others SMU Arizona Long Beach UCSB all roll as heavy favorites. UConn I liked initially but it is practically a home game for Memphis.

961303,0,t1_chdgi9e,So Washington have home court advantage after beating Indiana in game .. The team with home court advantage is the normally the favourite and thats the case here.If Indiana wins either of the next two games the odds will swing back in their favour as they will just have to win  of their remaining home games to clinch the series. This is a tough series to predict I think Indiana will win one of the next two games and I do think they will win the series. But Washington are a young team riding a ton of momentum first time in the nd round since  something but I think the experience of Indiana will overrule. So in that regard I would be putting a bet on them now before the odds change.. UNLESS you think Washington will win game  and they will be just  game away from winning the series..

1616476,0,t3_2cqmb9,Sorry for all of the posts but I have another one for you guys to have a look at if you fancy it? Its a higher odds pick and one which maybe you can go small on but it has a good chance of coming in. It is worth noting for people following my picks I generally always want good odds and this generally doesnt always guarantee wins. I only try and recommend the ones I feel have more chance but anyway here goesCopa Libertadores Final play off leg  kick off am uk time Nacional Asuncion vs San Lorenzo   ML  .These are two maiden finalists in the Copa Libertadores and it should be a tight affair. San Lorenzo are from Argentina and Nacional are from Paraguay. They have both done brilliant to reach this stage in a competition which has recently been dominated by the Brazilian sides.Onto the match and Nacional have had great success at home in this competition playing  games winning  of those and only drawing the one. They also kept  clean sheets and that is what the success is built on a very strong defensive record. And it is also worth noting that Nacional have beaten similar opposition from Argentina  and  at home in this competition this season.As for San Lorenzo they are yet to win away in this competition in  matches and they failed to score in four of those matches. San Lorenzo have recently lost their best player and wonderkid in Angel Correra. Some of you may know him from his recent transfer to Atletico Madrid which will go through once this tournament is over. Atletico discovered a heart defect which he is having a heart operation on now and will therefore miss the game. Id expect a low scoring win for Nacional and a good bet will also be the under markets for this game I can see it being close. These would be somewhat safer. Fansunite do not seem to have this match to be able to update my profile there but you can still see it here andtheyreoffGood luck,sportsbook,cjix96g,2,t5_2s3v4

Two of the best young guns in the game right now both possess a lot of power and can serve in excess of mph on their best days  ATP average floats around mph for an average first serve. Both win over  of their service games and win less than  of their return games which makes for long sets and frequent tiebreak situations.

What my point is is that by advanced metrics they are top ten in shutting down the run and all passing routes of  yards or less. I just dont think either brady or manning at this rate are going to be throwing many go routes. Maybe back shoulder fades or deep ins.

In that regard the HOU pick was a vastly superior pick.On Ole Miss it completely missed how hard theyd fight back.

Brandon jennings is comin off a career night and i really see that the pistons are meshing under SVG offense. Bucks on the other hand have point guard knight and greek freak giannis who have been carrying the team thus far but will fall short tonight. Ever since pistons waived Forward josh smith the pistons have significantly improved on the offensive and defensive efficiency.

3343792,0,t3_2yfqcg,My record is available here  NHL New York Islanders At Toronto Maple LeafsI think a lot of people are going to see that Bernier and Neuvirth are in net tonight and jump to see some goals. Well they may be right but I dont see the game playing out that way. Neuvirth is certainly a downgrade from Halak but he proved in his last set of games with the Sabres that he can certainly play to a very high level. He has not shown the same form since coming to the Islanders but Im sure he is gaining familiarity with their system. Bernier has been the better of the two Toronto goalies but truthfully they are both being undermined by a bad team giving a poor effort. I cant think that the Islanders are especially happy with their performance against the Panthers in their last game a  shootout loss. They failed to take advantage of the Panthers goaltending woes and instead gave the Panthers a ton of slot opportunities. I have to think that the team tightens up in front of their backup goalie whom they have not yet given a good performance. The Leafs defensive performances of late are certainly a worry but I have to think that any semblance of pride that the Leafs players may have may one day lead to a performance with some effort. They were embarrassing last game and I cannot believe that professional athletes will have back to back days of that same effort. Im going to have two plays on this game. One is under the total and the other is on the Islanders. I definitely prefer the under but I think that taking the Islanders is a bit of a safety net in that if any team causes this game to go over the total I have to think its the Islanders. My Pick of The Day is Under  Goals  .. Im also going to take the New York Islanders   .. If you cannot get  then take the Islanders to win in regulation.Other picks areUnder . Goals in EDMDETUnder .

Also think ND plays for their coach his mom just died while Wichita St has a letdown after finally getting to play and beating Kansas. ND in a close oneNorth Carolina Wisconsin Waiting to hear about Meeks but if hes okay I like the heels and the points. UNC has the defensive personnel to match up and should make up for their lack of offensive efficiency with offensive rebounds and putbacks. UNC has a healthy shot of pulling the upset IF they can hit their free throws.UNC . EDIT I have no idea and will be putting nothing on this game. West VirginiaKentucky No read on this game. West Virginias bread and butter is the full court and trapping defense to force turnovers. However doing that to UK is unleashing the Kraken. They will obliterate WVU with their length for dunk and dunk if they try to trap all game. Bob Huggins is a good coach and he may think of something else. WVU has shooters so they may be able to hit enough threes to stay in it. Alas no betXavier Arizona Arizona ML Xavier with the points. Arizona has cruised the first two rounds. Xavier plays a brand of basketball allowing them to slow it down and muck it up. I think this is Arizonas  close game that they have to get past if they wanna make any true noise.

3934038,0,t3_35g6af,Just a quick reminder I may be without internet access for a few days. Check yesterdays NHL thread for more information but basically Im going to a Game Reserve where there might not be internet. Either way Im back in Canada on the weekend. If I have internet Ill be sure to post plays.My record is available here  NHL New York Rangers At Washington CapitalsWell I think this is a doordie game for both teams. Ive been backing the Capitals in a few games this series but never the Rangers. Thats not a slight at the New York Squad far from it. I think they are one of if not the best team in the league. Its just that I quite like this Capitals squad quite like coach Trotz and think that it just might be there time. Either way if the Capitals lose tonight Ill be backing the Rangers in Game . Basically this is the season for both teams in my opinion. Both goalies are just posting insane numbers but totals are a little scary as its an elimination game and empty net shenanigans seem to be the norm. No matter I think this is going to be a very tight game regardless. The Rangers have done a masterful job at silencing Ovechkin and Backstrom so the Capitals having last line change might be very important. The total amount of goals scored in the games in Washington in this series is . Im taking Under  Goals  .. Im also going to take the Washington Capitals to win  .. Sorry ujmurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrzNHL Calgary Flames At Anaheim DucksIm not going to bother talking about who is going to win this game. Im backing the Ducks. I think they are better in every department and will get it done tonight. Simple. The Flames have not won in Anaheim since . Now Ive backed the Over in the last two games in this series and its hit both times. I actually see a different type of game tonight and Im hoping that there is no empty net drama that ruins this bet. If its wrong I hope its because I misread the game. I see a much more careful approach from the Flames in this one. They play such a kamikaze style generally but especially at home. They throw their defense forward to create chances but are often exposed. I cant see them playing that type of game tonight as the Ducks will shred them with last change. Speaking of last change I think the Flames will struggle to score goals when the Ducks get the matchups they want. Moreover and this is off the top of my head but I think the HudlerGaudreau line have  points total this series and are a . Moreover I think the Flames will be doing absolutely everything they can to keep the Ducks out of the net. I dont think they will succeed but I do think we will see a lower scoring game. My Pick of the Day is Under . Goals  .. Im also going to take the Anaheim Ducks to win in REGULATION .  .,sportsbook,cr4prmm,4,t5_2s3v4

Danks is terrible and the blue jays are pounding left handed hitting this year. With reyes back and  straight wins I think the Blue jays stay hot and put up a decent number of runs.

4090347,0,t1_crmg6z1,For the NYY vs KC game we had this matchup  days ago and the Royals were able to get to Pineda while Young spread  hits over ..  The problem is Young is another fly ball pitcher shutters thinking of Guthries game so that is a big concern as well as the Royals bats going quiet the past few games.  Young is a very good pitcher he just does it in a very atypical way and uses his size and deception instead of over powering guys.  The stat they like to throw out each game is this one      gt Among active major league pitchers who have thrown at least  career innings Young has allowed the fewest hits  and his . career opponents batting average is secondlowest in that group behind Clayton Kershaw ..

The National League will suspend the Mets manager for two games and fine him for using the disguise.MIL  PITTodays game marks former No.  pick Taylor Jungmanns Major League debut. Though hes no longer considered a top prospect the Texas Longhorn alumni had some success in the minors last year achieving a K above  not allowing many dongers and winning more than he lost. Wish I could say the same for him this year as hes kind of struggled for the Brewers AAA affiliate this year. Heres a video of him pitching a few months ago His best pitch is a twoseamer that he almost always throws down in the zone. He also features an  curveball that sits in the upper s that he uses as his out pitch. His problem has always been command and though hes developed a changeup he struggles with locating it and it sometimes finds its way back up in the zone. The odds on this game arent really worth playing so Ill be staying away. It will be interesting to see how Jungmann does against the Pirates bats though so if you have the ability to watch this game this would be one worth checking out!MIA  TORYesterdays bet hit pretty quickly and I feel pretty good about this game as well. Buehrles peripherals indicate that hes pitched worse than his  record indicates. Hes striking out less batters than any point in his career and batters are making  more hard contact off him compared to last year. The Marlins are a good LHP hitting team going ... . BAbip against them this season. Old man Danny Haren has been better for the Marlins though both his and Buehrles FIP sit around . but hes pitched well under pressure this season getting timely outs in jams. I like the plus odds on Miami even though they looked deplorable yesterday so Ill be taking the Marlins ML . My book has the run total at  and that seems high for this game.CHC  DETThese are two teams that perform poorly against strikeout pitchers the Tigers surprisingly moreso than the Cubs. Both Sanchez and Lester have high HRFBs this year as well. Quite honestly I thought the stats would support one team over the other but this will probably be a fairer matchup than I anticipated. Another game to watch for sure but one to exhibit caution betting on. If I were to make a play here it would be under . runs total.PHI  CINHarang and DeSclafani have similar peripherals both arent really strikeout pitchers dont walk too many batters and keep the ball in the yard. DeSclafani owns a . FIP. ERA compared to Harangs . FIP. ERA. Harangs last start came against the Reds and he got knocked around a bit giving up  ER through . innings. DeSclafani also got knocked around by Philly in his last start giving up  ER through  innings. There really isnt any value in the line for this game to me. No play.SFG  NYMSyndergaard is pitching better than his . ERA and  record indicate his FIP is . and hes pacing . K. Groundball pitcher Heston isnt too shabby himself posting a . FIP. ERA. Id give the Giants bat the edge here just because they actually can get the barrel on the ball against Kpitchers posting a ... slashline against pitchers in the top rd percentile in terms of strikeouts. The same cant be said about the Mets against groundball pitchers as their bats have posted a ... line against pitchers similar to Heston this season. I will say that the Mets bats are hot right now as theyve posted a . OPS over the last  days and a . OPS over the last . Wind conditions favor batters today and probably wont be doing either pitcher any favors here. I like over  runs total here.HOU  CWSWith two lefties on the mound we have a lot of data to work with here. Neither one of these teams does well against lefty pitching but the White Sox still rank among the worst in the league against southpaws posting a . OPS and . BAbip. To compound matters the Sox are slumping anyway going ... over the last  days and not much better over the last two weeks. They also bat abysmally against groundball pitchers . OPS . BAbip and Keuchel is one of the best GB pitchers in the league. The Astros are also slumping offensively . OPS  BAbip over the last week and have lost  in a row but might rebound if they can maintain good plate discipline not their strong suit against Rodon who has been money in his last  starts. The Astros did have  hits against him two weeks ago but only could mount  run. Im taking the better pitcher here with Keuchel and backing the Stros ML  for a small play.STL  COLI dont think Ive seen a bigger ERAFIP differential than Ive seen from De La Rosa this season. His FIP is only . but his ERA is .. Hes striking out more batters than ever in his career and walking more too and inducing groundballs at a . clip. Anyway De La Rosa hasnt been great at home thusfar posting an  ERA while batters own an OPS over . against him at Coors. Wacha has only pitched at Coors once in his young career and he didnt pitch well either giving up  ER thru  IP and a HR. Wacha has been great this season even though his K numbers are down hes still being efficient and not really giving up homeruns. I personally like the plusodds on the Rockies as they are currently the hotter hitting team and the Cards numbers this season against lefties arent the greatest. I see De La Rosas luck turning around at least a bit here so Im taking Rockies ML .,sportsbook,cs0jzm0,11,t5_2s3v4

4231193,0,t1_cs1ucq7,I have found in the past that sticking to a few key stats and focusing more on total season play more effectively works in the long term rather than over or under valuing pitchers or lineup changes. That said I use SIERA to account for starting pitcher ability BaseRuns from FanGraphs.com under the standings section for RG stats and overall team performance and a very small amount of adjustment for hitters by use of wOBA but try not to change for this unless there is a very notable absence from a lineup which I often tend to not play.

Sweden so Germany really only played one good team in the group stage and that was Norway with the which they tied . Sweden tied all three of their group stage matches with the U.S. Nigeria and Australia. What does this tell me?

Regulation Time Over . goals China v. Cameroon This is in an interesting match. China ML at even is the safer pick but I dont bet to be safe. Cameroon had an impressive group stage so I will continue to ride on their momentum and put a little on their ML at  because I like the odds as well as a little more on the Regulation Time Over . goals . Cameroon forces out a ton of shots I cant imagine them not scoring at least once and since China is the more talented team it should force them to be more aggressive and score more than they have been in the group stage.The only worry with these round of  games is if it is a close match you have the possibility of OT and teams getting defensive towards the end of regulation time if the score is tied.,sportsbook,cscwcbg,2,t5_2s3v4

4857183,0,t3_3he987,My record is available here  UEFA Champions League Lazio vs. Bayer LeverkusenFor Lazio this game could have a dramatic effect on their season in the sense that Mario Balotelli is rumored to be joining the squad if they qualify for the Champions League group stage. Im a big Balotelli supporter although even I can acknowledge he is a bit of an idiot. Actually both of these teams are two of my favorite sides to watch and to back. They both play an attacking style that is enjoyable to watch and they both possess some fantastic attackers. Lazio have a bit of a problem in that their first choice goalie Marchetti is missing this game so Im curious to see the effect that has. Leverkusen arent really set up to play a defensive game. They are the prototypical German side that we watch week in and week out in their domestic league in that the best form of defense is a great attack. They have great fullbacks that offer support a sometimes clinical striker in Kiessling and a great distributive midfield composed of Kramer Bender Son Bellarabi and Calhanoglu. I expect them to have some joy against a Lazio side that will be intent on grabbing a lead before heading to Germany for the second leg. I was very tempted to take Lazio to win here before deciding to leave it out. The odds on offer for goals is just too tempting to possibly taint it by backing a team to win. My Pick of The Day is Over . Goals  .UEFA Champions League Manchester United vs. Club BruggeYes LVG and United have had a poor start to the season. Theyve looked far from convincing. However that will come. The important thing to me is that theyve looked very tactically sound and have not yet conceded. In fact theyve barely been threatened. I dont see them being too threatened today either as Club Brugge are missing way too many important players. Importantly to me they are missing Rafaelov. He is an amazing creator on his day and if he was available Id be second guessing my thoughts. He can create something out of nothing but just as easy hes invisible. Castillo is out so are some other starting XI players. They will be starting Cools at right back and hes just been signed as a  year old out of the Belgian second division. It seems a bit of a tough ask to now go to the Theatre of Dreams and do battle against Depay or Young. Moreover rumors are circling that theyve agreed to transfer De Sutter to Bursaspor contingent on them not getting out of this qualifying round which seems very likely. Now I cant back a lot of goals in this match because United have yet to show me they are capable of it. Today might be the day and I would not be surprised but based on performance I need to go the other way. Moreover I dont think United will throw caution to the wind here. If LVG is anything its a meticulous planner almost to a fault. He knows a goal for Club Brugge could be disastrous. He will have to show respect too because Club Brugge are a very quick and mobile side. Still they lack experience and I expect the class of United to show through. Im taking Manchester United . AH  .. Im also going to take Under  Goals  .. I have to say this United . is scaring the shit out of me because everyone is on it and the odds arent reflecting that. Moreover it seems a bit easy given the quality gap. Still Im going to back United and hope Im just messing with myself. England Championship Derby vs. MiddlesbroughBoth of these teams have their sights set on promotion to the Premiership. This is for good reason both of these teams have quality in their side. Theyve both focused on attacking options as they hope to overwhelm the mediocre competition at offer in the championship. The truth about the championship is that its a brutal competition to play in. Competition is fierce and there is a ton of passion involved but not a lot of skill. Still these two sides have players chock full of Premiership experience and I foresee their quality seeing out. For example Derby have Darren Bent and Andreas Weimann as well as Tom Ince who can all put the ball in the net. Middlesbrough have the sometimes prolific David Nugent who is expected to grab a starting spot. He came off the bench last game and had a decent cameo performance but I expect a much better game from him today. Im going to take Over  Goals  .England Championship Blackburn Rovers vs. Cardiff CityBlackburn have had a bit of a stuttering start to their Championship campaign posting a loss and a draw as well as a shock defeat in the Carling Cup to Shrewsbury Town. This is certainly not the start envisioned by ownership and manager Bowyer. Hopefully Rhodes is back for injury for them otherwise this could be a very tough game. They take on a Cardiff City side that have yet to lose. Sure its only a couple of games into the season but Cardiff have gotten points off of good Championship sides in QPR and Fulham. They some Premiership worthy quality in their side in Pilkington Macheda Dikgacoi and Fabio. I like the Welsh side to continue their run of form. Im taking Cardiff City .

4890146,0,t1_cuasyst,I hope the Bum gets  Ks but I have no idea. I dont bet stuff like that unless Im really feeling like having some fun and usually for only like .u or even less.As for the Dodgers and Rockies I really cant fully answer that question today pressed for time and running around gotta catch a flight soon. Short answer for Dodgers pitching is close but I feel the edge goes to Anderson when all things are considered. They also have quite an advantage in batting in my opinion. The only thing I dont like is the bullpen match up. Im more than likely going to be taking this as a  inning bet also I think that may be a little safer but also more juiced.Rockies Mets arent hitting all that well and have only hit Gray  shit for a sample size but lets hope it continues. Rockies bats arent a whole lot better but I have very little faith in Colon at altitude today and Grays been looking good in his limited experience this year. Bullpen could be a concern if the game is close so st  here is another play I might be taking. Thats a lot of bets tho and a lot invested in just  games so well see.I know those are really shitty explanations but its the best I can do right now. Sorry. Good luck!,sportsbook,cuaxwxk,1,t5_2s3v4

Follow at your own risk and research it yourself Im not an expert in any sport I just found something I think has good valueFIBA Europe CupFrankfurtFraport Skyliners . Bet vs FC Porto. Antwerp Giants . Bet vs SL Benfica.Both games start at PM CET in about  hours.Im portuguese Im a Benfica fan. I think this odds are off because they are based on the fact that both Frankfurt and Antwerp dont need this last match its a group phase to qualify but the difference in quality between them and the portuguese teams is huge and that alone should lead them to victories even if playing rotation players.I would say Benfica has a chance but we are underdogs but FC Porto Im very confident will lose whatever happens. As I said Im not a betting or basketball expert what lead to me to post this instead of just betting on it myself is that the betting companies made this mistake already for an earlier match today Tajfun vs Bakken Bears where they put Tajfun as favorites despite being the weaker team just because Bakken Bears already qualified and the Bears are leading by  points in the last quarter.EditBenfica    Antwerp.Porto    Frankfurt.,sportsbook,cxkk6wf,3,t5_2s3v4

6351801,0,t3_42j6e4,It was good to go  after a rough start to the year. As always all my plays can be found hereFirst play is Rockets  WIN. Rockets are still without D but I think Houston is finally starting to get its mojo back. Harden is averaging a triple double over his last four games Beverley is healthy Lawson is getting into a groove and I think the addition of JSmoove was huge depth and chemistry wise. Rockets have played like a different team since that acquisition. On the flip side Pelicans are on a roll going  and beating every team by  in their recent home stand. Statistically the Rockets are slightly better in offensive efficiency while the Pelicans are superior in defensive efficiency. The Rockets also play at a higher tempo and the Pelicans arent exactly amazing in terms of fast break defensive efficiency as they rank  in that category. I think a big key for the Rockets is whether or not they are making their three pointers as they average the most  point attempts a game and New Orleans is not good at defending the   in  pointers allowed per game  in opponent  point percentage. One tough thing for the Rockets will be stopping Anthony Davis without D but I thing a tandem of Brewer Cappella and Smith can at least contain him. Im high on the Rockets as of late the matchup looks favorable for Houston on paper and the line seems generous enough so I am taking the points.One other play I am looking to make is Minnesota . st Quarter WIN against Cleveland. Believe it or not but Minny actually averages more st Q points a game . then Cleveland . and Minny has gotten off to red hot starts lately as they are averaging . st Q PPG in their last  while Cleveland is averaging a measly .. Minnesota is also top  in points allowed per st Q tying Cleveland with .. Cleveland is going through a rough transition period right now and that has come with slow starts offensively. I think that may continue again here as on paper Minny is the superior st quarter team and . is a pretty massive line.EDIT   game win streak hoping to keep it up tomorrow.

6695041,0,t3_479wqx,Manchester City ML  . at Dynamo Kiev Champions League Round of Manchester City are far and away the better team. Kiev have been on winter break for a couple of months and thus havent played a competitive match in some time. City rested pretty much their entire first team this past weekend to prepare and be fresh for this match. Chelsea drew Kiev at Kiev in the group stages during their worst form of the season so I think City should be able to grab a victory. Citys owners really want European success so they should be going all out from here on out. Another European giant Atletico Madrid is  away at PSV. I think Atletico is another solid bet but personally I would go with City.

6848747,0,t3_49fv41,My record is available here  NHL Pittsburgh Penguins vs. New York IslandersBefore the season I could have seen this matchup as a possible ECF finals matchup. Instead the Penguins are still borderline to make the playoffs and need to pick up points where possible. They are buoyed by Malkin and Bonino having returned recently. Malkin especially has looked electric as of late and I expect him to have join against the Islanders. I think this is going to have a bit of a playoff feel and neither goalie is coming in off of a good game so it should be very entertaining. I also think there is going to be quite a few powerplays tonight. Both teams will be looking to make an impression and I think there will be a couple of loose plays. In the end I have more faith in Halak than I do Fleury and the Islanders having won six of their last seven only adds. My Pick of The Day is Over . Goals  .. Im also going to take the New York Islanders to win  .NHL New York Rangers vs. Buffalo Sabres  Over  Goals  .Last nights game against the Leafs was easily the loosest performance Ive seen from the Sabres. It seems like the futility of their season has started to set in as they are now just playing out the rope. Not having OReilly has certainly dented their defensive abilities. Raanta will be in for the Rangers and hes fresh off of a terrible performance in which he gave up  goals to the Islanders. Lehner has been playing well and is extremely competitive but I dont see how he stands much of a chance against a lacklustre team ahead of him. NHL Ottawa Senators vs. Carolina Hurricanes  Carolina Hurricanes to win  .I was one of those people who was cheering for the Senators to go on another cinderella run and end this season in the playoffs. Unfortunately their lack of depth and lapses in concentration have caught them. Their lack of depth has been exposed by a coach who tinkers and a poor blueline. If Borowieckis absence is remarkable on your backend you cant be a good team. I love the guy but he shouldnt play a higher role than a  on a good team. On the Senators his absence creates a third pairing made up of some combination of Weircioch Wideman or Kostka. Wideman has had a decent season but has his own shortcomings. Kostka is a journeyman and Weircioch has been a massive disappointment this season. The Hurricanes arent getting good goaltending but have looked good in their last two. I like them tonight. NHL Detroit Red Wings vs. Columbus Blue Jackets  Columbus Blue Jackets to win  .The Wings poor play of late has thrust them right back into a dogfight for the playoffs. They are barely holding off the surging Flyers and are now faced with an important game against a hardworking Columbus side. The Jackets wont convince anyone they are a good team but they do block a ton of shots get to the night and play with passion despite the playoffs being a pipedream. They are one of those teams I love to back because generally I know they are going to give a good effort. Unfortunately their last game was one of the worst Ive seen from them all season. I do expect Tortorella to have laid into his team following the  shellacking by Philly and think there will be a much improved performance tonight.

He is in horrible form with  of those losses being  whitewashes. Of course the worry is that he eventually has to win a game but I see no reason why his run of bad form should end tonight against Wade.Wade is the better player and dominates the HH stats. He can be an inconsistent player at times but he has generally been playing well in the Premier League winning the last  games he has played against Chisnall and Van Barneveld.

7148194,0,t3_4ddvwo, yesterday Ill take it.This Day in Baseball History  Babe Ruth collapses at a railroad station in Asheville North Carolina. The bellyache heard round the world so dubbed when a writer suggests that his illness was caused by a hot dogs and soda binge will require hospitalization and an operation keeping the Yankees slugger out of the lineup until May.Bonus TDiBH Because of my Davis Fanboy status  joining Willie Mays  Mark McGwire  and Nelson Cruz  Chris Davis who collects a grand slam and five RBIs in the Orioles home opener becomes the fourth player in major league history to homer in his first four games of the season. The  yearold Baltimore first baseman also breaks the RBI mark for the same span driving in  runs four more than the previous record shared by three players.  Now to the games.STL  PITMan the East Coast is cold today. Well Wacha took a step backward last year posting worse peripheral stats across the board compared to  but he was still solid with a . FIP while keeping his HR under .. Those of you who tailed me last year know that Im not a Jon Niese guy. I think he belongs in a bullpen as a long relief guy his FIP last year was almost a full point better as a reliever not as a No  starter. Hes a contact ground ball hitter that doesnt get too many strikeouts . K and is home run prone if a hitter can get his pitch airborne . HRFB. Niese will probably have a hard time with the Cards righthand batter heavy lineup and Id be surprised if he went more than five innings. I like Wacha in this spot because hes a consistent pitcher he doesnt have any clear disadvantages away from home or against batters from either side of the plate. The Pirates looked very much in sync offensively in their first game of the season against Wainwright but I just dont see Niese having success against the a good contact hitting team. I took the Cards ML  LCOL  ARIHa last nights game was nuts. How about Trevor Story?? That kid must feel pretty good right now.Remember that Shelby Miller trade? What I consider to be one of the worst if not the worst trade in the last  years of Major League Baseball? Regardless I get why the Dbacks wanted Miller because I think he is primed for a major year. If you look at his peripherals over the last few years theyve gotten better every season culminating last year with the Barves where despite playing for a dumpster fire of a team he still managed to put up a solid . FIP . WAR bringing up his K numbers and lowering his walks. And strangely his velocity also rose a MPH resulting in more soft contact and far less hard contact than hes seen in prior years. If he continues this forward progress he will be just what the doctor ordered for the Snakes. I was pleasantly surprised with both offensive performances last night though the Dbags definitely squandered a few key situations with runners on. Lets talk about Chad Bettis for a minute. Honestly I was kind of floored by his stats after looking them up for some reason I remember him not being great last year but he definitely was pretty decent especially outside of Coors. Away from the high altitude he held batters to a . wOBA posting a . FIP though its worth noting his xFIP was higher .. His LR split distribution is odd he strikes out more RHBs than lefties . vs . K walks half as many righties but had an equal amount of earned runs against both last year in roughly an equal amount of innings partly because hes more prone to give up HRs to RHBs. And I write all this to say though I was initially leaning Dbags I think the real value here is with the Rockies ML at  but I just have a feeling that Miller will be strong today so this is a stay away game for me.HOU  NYYWhat I said yesterday still applies but without the chance of rain today Im going to roll with the Astros ML  WTOR  TBAaron Sanchez is not a good starter. That much is clear. Over his career he has as many relief innings as starting innings lets take a look at the difference.| | K| BB| HR| FIP| wOBA|||||Starter| .| .| .| .| .Reliever| .| .| .| . | .So why is Gibbons using him as a starter? Probably because he has water on his brain and  mixed with milk in his glass. Sanchez is just awful against LHBs as well so look for Dickerson LoMo and Kiermaier to have decent days. Im not as hot on Odorizzi as a lot of people are mainly because he only has two plusplus pitches. Hell I dont even know if he even has a useable third pitch. Unfortunately for Jake his specialty is against lefties and the Blue Jays lineup is just about all RHBs...something he traditionally has not been great against.|| K| BB| HR| FIP| wOBA|||||v LHB| .| .| .| .| .v RHB| .| .| .| .| .I still trust Odorizzi more than Sanchez and am going to roll with the Rays ML  W at home and would also think long and hard about over  runs total L.BOS  CLEI guess I didnt look at the numbers close enough in this game yesterday because of the weather. Well since I dont like much else today I looked into this game and feel pretty confident taking Boston. Price has no LR deficiencies tends to pitch well early in the season over his career and just seems very comfortable with his new teammates. Kluber struggled against LHBs last year as they had higher OBPs and slugging compared to their righthanded counterparts. The bottom two thirds of Bostons lineup is basically exclusively left handed. I also believe the Red Sox just have more firepower in their lineup compared to Cleveland as long as Brantley is out. If this game wasnt played at Progressive Boston would be the favorites here and I think its kind of egregious that they are the underdogs here. I like the Red Sox ML .

7230477,0,t3_4ebtbc,Caps vs Flyers I really think the Caps are going to dominate this series from top to bottom. I took a prop for a small amount for Caps to win in . I know they played a little lax towards the later stages of the season. But these guys have been patiently waiting for playoffs for a while. Based on what I saw early this season alone is enough for me to confidently take the Caps.Im also confident in the Panthers Lightning and Ducks to all exit this first round. I cant decide who I think will win it all as of now but after this first round plays out Ill probably take a bet. ,sportsbook,d201vd2,1,t5_2s3v4

7243532,0,t3_4ehuxa,Raquel Pennington  vs Bethe Correia Bethes last fight was the Rousey beatdown. Her fights previous to that in the UFC were against the unheralded Shayna Bazler  Julie Kedzie  and Jessamyn Duke  where she won by Tko decision and decision. Raquel just avenged an earlier loss to Jessica Andrade in September on the DodsonMighty Mouse card and previous to that she lost a split decision to Holly Holm. Raquel will enjoy a . inch reach advantage which she will use as she picks apart Bethe standing. Bethe will try to go to her strength which is pushing her opponent against the cage and dirty boxing or taking them down. Unfortunately for her Raquel is a good clinch fighter and caught Jessica Andrade with some knees in the clinch along the cage in her last night and Andrade is a MUCH better figher than Correia. Bethes path to victory is coaxing Raquel into a slugfest. Although Raquel is the better striker a slugfest could benefit Correia as Bethe has actually shown a decent chin when she is conscious. The pick is Raquel Pennington . I wouldnt bet any props on method of victory as she is unpredictable in this respect. ,sportsbook,d21jced,2,t5_2s3v4

The books are saying Team A will win . of the time and team B will win  of the time. The point is that if those teams win at the rate the oddsmakers say theyll win then youll net  because the amount youll win over  games will never exceed what youd lose. Using team A as an example .    . is essentially . Winning . games at  wont overcome what youd lose losing . games. But what if you think differently? What if you think team A wins  of the time? Well then you got value because the oddsmakers are giving you a number for a win percentage thats less than what you rate the team as.      is more than . ,sportsbook,d2mesr8,5,t5_2s3v4

Duda and Granderson are out of the lineup but they both have pretty bad splits against lefties so I dont see that as a major loss to the team. DeGrom owned the Dodgers all season and postseason last year and has looked great this year so far. Im riding with them and playing Mets  u in addition to my u bet above. Dont see the Dodgers having an edge here. Havent been doing any writeups recently. Ill get my shit together.EDIT Just because I have a little bit of free time this morning Ill quickly blaze through some of my reasonings without getting too detailed with stats. Pirates  mainly a fade of Simon  look at his BB HRFB and BABIP. Nicacio has looked decent this year too and already shut the Reds down recently. Dbacks  Rubby is doing a much better job this year of keeping the ball low and getting ground balls and this is wellreflected on his BABIP. Also Dbacks are in the top  in hitting lefties this year OPS Avg etc. Mets  Dodgers have heated up slightly since the Marlins and Padres series a couple of weeks ago but still havent been consistent offensively. DeGrom is a great play at  especially with Alex Wood opposing him who struggled against the Mets last year and has allowed at least  ER in  of his  starts this year. Blue Jays  fading Matt Cain and Happ has looked very much improved this year. Only thing holding me back from multiple units at this price is that Jays bats have been quiet and the Giants hit lefties very well. I just dont think Cain will be able to keep them in this one.

She did look like a beast in open workouts. smith looks very hittable. now while  is almost unplayable cybord in rnd  at  might be worth a play.i favor souza in this fight but i think  is too much juice to pay. theres a reason why vitor always fights in brazil. he is still very dangerous in rnd . value in vitor TKO rnd  at . i would suggest perhaps live betting souza if he survives rnd .UFC is throwing barberena to the wolves after beating sage. but at  i cant touch it.i think lil nog has had his fair share of injuries. he also talks about how this is his first camp without his brother. I think hes forcing a return because its such a big card in brazil. i dont think hes mentally or physically prepared. cummings should win easily except for a flukey submission from the bottomfinally maia should find an easy finish of matt brown maia has been underrated forever. however if brown can survive the first  rounds brown has survived worse and tons of value in brown in rnd .,sportsbook,d33ymip,7,t5_2s3v4

If youre making a large number of small bets then just randomly betting on  moneylines will produce the same loss as betting both sides of the same game.EDIT In case anyone wonders why this is a valid strategy we can apply the law of large numbers. Given that we only bet  games by this I mean  moneylines our set of potential results will be binomially distributed. The law of large numbers tells us that even if we lose or win in the short term we will eventually settle at the expected value and win right around half of our bets.,sportsbook,d3hjz6z,1,t5_2s3v4

Long ass post. . pm GMT I doubt were going to see any more action today. At least the plays underway started very well.Djokovic vs BautistaAgut . .Djokovic vs BautistaAgut O. games .Come on now... Djokovic is going to win this match but . games? Hes won by   and  games in his three matches so far.  BautistaAgut hasnt had the best clay season so far even losing convincingly   to Nole just this month in Madrid. Hes looked better in the French Open also ing his opponents in every round. Bati isnt your stereotypical Spanish player but while he is a clay specialist who tends to be pretty aggressive he is good at keeping composure in longer rallies.Im not saying hes going to take a set but when hes given . games I have to take a flier on it.David Ferrer vs Tomas Berdych O. games .David Ferrer . games vs Tomas Berdych .Ill admit I didnt have a lot of faith in Ferrer coming into RG but he is looking almost like prime Ferrer at times. Berdych is a tough customer though and recently dispatched a similar player in Pablo Cuevas. Another big server who might get slightly hampered on damp clay in Paris. Berdych beat Ferrer in Madrid this month  . These guys usually play each other close and I think it will be the case tomorrow as well. Adding a small play on Ferrer to win but Im more confident in the over.Marcel GranollersPujol vs Dominic Thiem  . L Tiebreaks will be the death of me one dayThiem is probably happy that Nadal withdrew cause there is no way Granollers could have gotten to the round of  if not. Thiem had a great runup to the French Open and hes also gathering steam from match to match. I think he takes it comfortably.David Goffin vs Ernests Gulbis  .David Goffin . sets vs Ernests Gulbis .Like Thiem Goffin was lucky to avoid a top player in Tsonga who was forced to retire after starting hot against Gulbis. I dont think Gulbis is consistent enough. Goffin is the superior talent and player but I wont count out the possibility of Gulbis maybe stealing a set.Serena Williams vs Elina Svitolina . .Serena Williams vs Elina Svitolina O. sets .Serena is probably gonna win like she always does but she had a real scare against Mladenovic on Saturday. Svitolina herself has been terrific knocking off both Cirstea and Ivanovic in straight sets. Im going with what I think has value here. Plus Svitolina is a fucking bombshellRichard Gasquet ML vs Andy Murray ..Richard Gasquet . vs Andy Murray .Richard Gasquet vs Andy Murray  .Richard Gasquet vs Andy Murray O. games .I got on this as soon as it was posted but I see its down to the . area ayyyy. Murray is  against Gasquet on clay but only once at Wimbledon in  has Murray won in straights. I havent been particularly impressed with the Brit during this French Open and I think he would have had it a lot tougher against Isner if the courts were dry. Gasquet has been fucking thriving so far smashing Kyrgios and only giving up a set in a very impressing showing against Nishikori. Granted Nishikori looked very uncomfortable on the wet clay but Gasquet was hitting winners all over the place. This is a perfect storm for Richard he has a ton of momentum and what could be a huge advantage the home crowd. They love him and with Murray being extra whiny these last couple of games the French are gonna let him have it when he inevitably starts moaning. I see a fivesetter coming if Gasquet plays anything close to the level hes shown so far. O. sets . is pretty generous as well IMO.Albert RamosVinolas . vs Stan Wawrinka .Rode with Ramos against Raonic but Im gonna be a little more careful here. He showed enough to make me think he can keep this closer than people think and more than even money is enough for me to put a small play on it.Thoughts or suggestions are very welcome. Im gonna add that Im slightly biased against Murray so proceed with caution. From what Ive seen during Roland Garros I still have to take Gasquet.

8093540,0,t3_4q0grk, Yesterday....my book is offering a free  bet every week if you bet  on MLB during the week. Put it on the Braves because screw the Mets....that worked out. Only a few picks todayTORCOL O. EVEN  Colorados offense has been super hot lately and the Blue Jays have been heating up in the past  days. At first glance both pitchers look to be well above average but when looking at BABIP you see Estrada has been a bit lucky and Gray gives up a lot of homersFB....and the Blue Jays have a top  FB. Plus Coors. Phillies   Their wRC has gone from   day split to   day split which means they are heating up a bit. Ray is a better pitcher but Velasquez has been a bit unlucky lately giving up a . BABIP. Both pitchers strike out a lot of people and dont walk much. The big thing to note is the DBacks suck at home.... is a very bad home record and while the Phillies arent great home or away I like the value here. Plussssss Phillies might be pissed these guys swept them last week at home revenge is a bitch. Angels   Im basically betting on Shoemaker to have a good game. Not sure if I love him because of his beard or what but the dude strikes people out and usually gives up a bad home run once a game. Has not gotten much offensive support lately and I am hoping they are riding high off the walk off last night. Also might be playing a little law of averages here thinking that the Stros need to cool down at some point. ,sportsbook,d4psc02,2,t5_2s3v4

8204272,0,t3_4rol0x,If youre watching the game a lot of times you can see a guy is getting hit hard but right at someone or is walkinggetting into a lot of deep counts on batters. They can usually only get away with it for so long until a couple of guys get on base and someone jacks one out. This happens a lot. Conversely sometimes the pitcher gains confidence by getting out of jams or lucking out on hard hit balls and end up pitching better as the game goes on. Theres no perfect science to it but the best way to guess is seeing how a pitchers control and hard contact rates are early on. ,sportsbook,d533711,0,t5_2s3v4

8214312,0,t1_d53va3g,Feel you with the nasty PMs Ive received some over the last year or so as well. As someone who watches the majority of the games that I bet on its insane how many games are won and lost over what seems like a miniscule action like a middle infielder not taking a step toward a grounder several milliseconds earlier or sun in the eyes of an outfielder that causes him to misplay a ball. Nothing we can do can predict that sort of shit! Before the season started people were saying that baseball is the easiest sport to handicap. I could not disagree more. On any given play there are at least fifty different things that can go wrong starting with the ball leaving the pitchers hand to when it gets put into play and to me that makes it very hard to handicap but its also the beauty of the sport. Ive found most of the shitty messages I get from people are generally from people who dont watch baseball or dont know enough about the sport to know any better. Cheers man good to have you back.,sportsbook,d54cdqb,4,t5_2s3v4

8228383,0,t3_4s30g4,My record is available here  You can follow me on Twitter here   Ive also added a Telegram channel if anyone wants to follow  Euro  Final Portugal vs. FranceFirst off I know that international matches get supporters emotional.  Even more so if its the final of the European Championship.  I truly do not mean to offend anyone with my preview.  Trust me when I say that I am a big fan of both of these teams as I have some strong familial reasons for being so. Ive tried to look at this match as objectively as possible. Cheers and now lets make some money. Finals of major championships are usually pretty conservative matches where both sides are trying to avoid any major mistakes.  That type of game definitely suits the Portuguese. Now we all saw the Portuguese struggles to finish off games in regulation this tournament.  Their Group Stage was probably as disappointing as possible for a team that actually qualified.  They were also quite poor against Croatia but so was their opposition. There was barely any action in that game until the very end of the match when Quaresma finished off a Ronaldo rebound.  They played better against the Polish but still that match required penalties the last of which Ronaldo finished off.  Lastly they played their best match of the tournament in their Semi Final victory over Wales.  They won the match  and were without a doubt in control for the vast majority of the game.  They created numerous attacking chances and were extremely fluid in transitioning their counter attack. Now I do put a lot of stock in the Welsh missing Ramsey.  Although the Portuguese were also missing key players Ramsey is instrumental to the Welsh side. The fact that he was out for the Semi Final was a big part of why I backed Portugal.  Theyve also got some players who have gotten better and better as the tournament progressed  Ronaldo finally looks like himself Nani has had a glass out of the fountain of youth Quaresma is turning into the king of cameo appearances and Renato Sanches is a joy to watch.  They are playing with a  with Carvalho providing extra support in front of the defensive line. The major issue for me with the Portuguese is that I havent seen the moments of brilliance that they are capable of with enough consistency. The French seemingly developed a habit of leaving things to the last minute enroute to the Semi Finals before they showed up with arguably the most impressive performance of the tournament.  Yeah sure they handled Iceland in the Quarter Finals but that type of performance should have been obvious to most observers. I do think they were lucky to skate by against Ireland but now they are here with a chance to emulate the success of Euro  and World Cup  by again winning the major tournament as the host nation. I do believe that the French will achieve the hat trick. They were one of my pretournament favourites and despite it not being smooth sailing their performance against Germany was satisfying.  Now I do want to acknowledge that the absence of Hummels and Khedira certainly played a major role in Frances  victory.  Moreover Germany had France on the backfoot for large portions of the match particularly for the middle third of the first half.  Nevertheless the French capitalized on two unfortunate errors by the Germans.  Although I do believe it was a bit of a soft penalty Schweinsteiger should not be contesting a header in the box with his hands up high and Neuer simply has to catch that ball.  Still the French deserved their victory in my opinion.  I wrote in my preview for the Germany vs. France match that I believed the victor would go on to win the European Championship and I stick by that sentiment.  That was the final.  Both Germany and France are a level above the Portuguese in terms of quality but the Portuguese ability to win is perhaps unparalleled. One of the major reasons I am backing the French in this encounter is the Portuguese tendency to drop back as soon as they lose possession.  They invite the opposition to attack and focus on securing a counter attacking ball. I think thats a dangerous game to play with a French team with the world class attackers that they possess.  Greizmann might be the best player in the world at the current moment Payet is always dangerous Pogba can dominate a match and their fullbacks have provided tremendous support.  Sure some of the French stars were disappointing in the Semis but I still have more faith in them to conjure the moment of magic necessary to win a match than I do the majority of the Portuguese side.  Basically the way I evaluate this match comes down to this If both teams with the players available to them were firing on all cylinders in this match who would I back? Thats an easy answer for me and its the French.  Now the beauty of the Finals is that either team can win but Im backing Deschamps and his men to emulate the success he enjoyed as the captain of the World Cup  squad by winning this continental showpiece on home soil.  My Pick of The Day is France to win  .Im also taking France to win Euro   .Im also taking Over  Goals  .,sportsbook,d563rcc,11,t5_2s3v4

FSU has huge carry over from last year plus now a mobile and rocketarm freshman QB who already lead the greatest FSU comeback in school history vs a very respectable opponent.   jimbo is a national championship coach who is an adjustment legend.  with this i only have reason to believe that FSU will be the same if not better than last year where they smashed louisville .what im asking is the other side of the equation can someone can tell me how louisville improved so much to command this line?  because ive done my dd and still cant figure it out.  there are a handful of new coaches including petrino promoting his son to be QB coach lol but is this enough?  the hype for louisville is the QB who FSU did fine vs last year.  FSU did fine vs a wellcompensated ole miss DL and OL.  jackson has put up some awesome numbers in week  and week   but against noname opponents.im legitimately asking what im missing here? is jackson just THAT good?  are my assumptions bad?  am i trapping myself?,sportsbook,d7k03a4,1,t5_2s3v4

And now the first  brazilian teams in Serie A will have a spot in the competition instead of . So teams who would be fighting for nothing at the end of Brazil Serie A will be fighting for this  extra spots.ampnbspAtleticoPR vs Chapecoense Brazil Serie A starts in  hoursAtleticoPR or Atletico Paranaense is at th place at the moment and they will fight against a lot of teams for these extra spots. Still  matches left in Brazil Serie A.Standings AtleticoPR is the best home team in brazilian league with  wins  draws and only  loss. The loss was against Palmeiras st place and best away team in the league. Atletico has  goals scored at home and only  conceded.Weverton AtleticoPR Goalkeeper will not play this match he is with the National Team but he was suspended anyways  yellow cards.Chapecoense is at th place and now they also have a chance to play Copa Libertadores next year. They are just  points away from AtleticoPR.Chapecoense is the th best away team in the league with  wins  draws  losses  goals scored and  conceded.They had an amazing away victory against Fluminense some weeks ago. But are now coming from a devastating loss at home.Head to head shows  draws between them in the last  matches. Last year in Brazil Serie A x this year x. Also this year in Brazil Cup x and x.I was leaning towards Chapecoense to not score because of Atleticos solid defense when playing at home but without Weverton Im not sure. I dont know much about the goalkeeper who is playing today.ampnbspI cant see Atletico losing this game but its the brazilian league at the end of the day.

9222946,0,t3_56onw1,Hello everyone! I havent been posting for a while but some nice OW games are coming upMy old record is  | .UampnbspPick of the Day . U. Reunited.gg ML vs Runaway . OGN ApexPersonally I feel like it is a lock but since new patch we have had many upsets so keep it in mind. Nonetheless it is a round robin bo in groups which makes us feel more confident in taking this bet however not  but top  of each group advances to playoffs but I think Reunited want to do quite well with their new roster since they picked up onigod instead of kyb quite recently and its their first tournament together. Moreover Runaway are nonamers and none of their players has any match history record yet they still can upset if they are unreal beasts. So we end up with EU team Reunited who are top in the world and they should be motivated enough to show their best since the addition of fresh blood and on the other hand we have KR team Runaway who are complete nonamers but still great performance of Lunatic Hai who beat Rogue a few days  and  makes Runaway a little bit dangerous and of course they might use a surprising factor and come out with some ridiculous tactics which are backed up with if they have unreal aim. expecting quick  from ReunitedampnbspSince my previous bets were awful I will not be posting my unit size and I will count later is if I bet U on it. Besides that my goal here is to provide my analysis which hopefully might help you guys make some skrilla. And even though my predictions can be right I might still be negative overall because of bet sizing that is why it is up to you how much you wanna bet but If you are willing to take the risk by betting on Reunited Id suggest to parlay it with something not significant for you or to make small single bet. Nevertheless my personal bet is ish U and I only provide this information to show you how Im confident in my analysis of this game ampnbspBet at your own risk. I accept no liability for any losing bets. Do not bet more than you can afford to lose.Hopefully everything goes our way! Best of luck everyone!,sportsbook,d8l2r47,1,t5_2s3v4

I think atlanta will be ready for seattled D they showed me they are for real after beating the broncos which set up a blue print for teams on how to beat the broncos D but u need to have a good pass catching back that can outrun linebackersand they will score at least  tds. seattle is seattle they create offense out of nothing and their wrs are trained to constantly move to get open,sportsbook,d8mi84u,2,t5_2s3v4
9238314,0,t3_56uttb,My record is available here  You can follow me on Twitter here   Ive also added a Telegram channel if anyone wants to follow  EUROPE  World Cup Qualifiers Lithuania vs. MaltaFirst of all I do want to tell everyone that these are two teams I know very little about beyond their general play style.  I know that Lithuanian soccer has started to rise again and Ive watched their domestic league a fair bit as well. For Malta I know they are also improving as are most smaller nations but obviously they are a far cry from a good international side.  In fact the best way to describe this match from my betting angle perspective is that of a situational bet. I just feel like this situation sets up well for an over. Lithuania have drawn their first two games of the qualifiers.  They were desperately unlucky to give up a late goal to Scotland who equalized off of a throw in in the th minute. Were it not for that goal Lithuania would have secured a famous away win.  They also managed a  draw at home against Slovenia which is an achievement as Slovenia are a good side though there is a lot of drama with their manager and players. Scoring two goals against a usually compact defensive side is good. For Malta well this is one of the only opponents against whom they could reasonably secure points.  I dont think we will see anything remotely close to the  defensive performance they put forth against England last round.  I think their play style will be a lot closer to the  home loss to Scotland where they actually tried to attack a bit. Ultimately I think Malta will be trying to actually score and Lithuania are easily good enough to put up  goals themselves.

Also their D is getting better by the week and will definitely get better this week as they get back both Deion Jones and Campbell at LB. Watch for Deion to have a big coming out game  tackles and a huge game defining solo stop. All it will take is  consecutive Defensive stops to get ATL in the groove of things and start dominating like they did the Broncos D. Will they win? Maybe.

Ill preface this by saying that I already jumped on Wisconsin .Iowas offense has been horribly inconsistent this year partially due to poor line play and losing our leading receiver to a broken foot. However Ferentz shuffled our oline lineup two weeks ago and its worked wonders in our running game the last two games those games were against Minnesota and Purdue tho so take that as you will lol. Our passing game has been pedestrian and I dont see that changing here.The hawks defense is pretty solid yet not spectacular so I think Iowa holds Wisconsin to  points. IMO Iowas chances hinge on whether or not they can run the ball. If not Wisconsin covers easily. But if they can...things could get interesting,sportsbook,d8xi6jc,1,t5_2s3v4

Raptors are a streaky team but love starting the season right and the Pistons give them just enough competition for them to care.  Demar should have a huge game because well he is Toronto.  Betting against this home crowd after last season would be insane.  The boys are looking to grab those unhappy jays fans back so I suspect they come strong.  I think the Sully injury actually helps the raptors in game one because it will force JV to come hard. ,sportsbook,d990y8h,1,t5_2s3v4

9422609,0,t3_59kjlf,NFL  . unitsJacksonville . | Betting . units  The Titans have not won at home by more than  points since .  Last year the teams split the season series at  game a piece and Tennesses win was a  point victory. Bortles has played  TNF games in his career both were against the Titans and both were at home. He lead the Jaguars to victories in both of those games winning them by an average of  points.  Jacksonville has  solid RBs coming out of the backfield who can both catch the ball and healthier Julius Thomas compared to the last time they faced the Titans. Jacksonvilles run game this year hasnt been great and they will be going against one of the best run defences in the NFL tonight. Bortles and the Jaguars offence does play better with a pass heavy playbook and that has been a key to their wins this season. Bortles has been struggling but this could be an opponent to get his pass game clicking again The Titans home game against the Browns was not convincing at all. The Titans seem to play at their opponents level this year at home this year and its not good enough to cover the pointsLets make some money!Danwww.danthebettingman.comSocial MediaampnbspInstagram |Twitter |Facebook,sportsbook,d9adppw,1,t5_2s3v4

9610650,0,t3_5cijav,NBA Record  . unitsLos Angeles Lakers  | Betting . unitsKeys to the pick The Lakers are  on the road this season and are  on the season however most of the teams theyve played have winning records. The Lakers are  against teams with losing records and the Pelicans just got their first win on Thursday. The Kings are  at home this season and their overall record is . The Pelicans are still figuring out who is deserving of minutes but it looks like Terrance Jones has earned himself more minutes going forward. Holiday and Evans are still out for the Pelicans and they have some new names in the starting rotation. Chemistry is a big issue for the Pelicans but running the offence throw Davis seems to be the safest bet at this time As for the Lakers the rookies are continuing to get better and the chemistry is looking great. They beat the Warriors once again this season and the way they beat them cant go unnoticed. Lou Williams is making yet another case for th man of the year and has really stepped up his game over the last  games scoring at least  points and averaging nearly  steals per game. The Lakers have a better bench and their team is putting together solid team performances. I like them stealing one in New Orleans.Atlanta Hawks . | Betting . unitsKeys to the pick The Hawks have beaten the Sixers  times in their last  meetings by . points on average. This has been one of the most lobsided match ups over the last  seasons and the Hawks have not disappointed. Embiid who has been one of the main producers of the Sixers this season will be sitting tonight and it looks as if the Sixers were throwing in the towel for this game. The Sixers played just last night to get their first win of the season and travel to Atlanta the very next night. The  Hawks on the other hand have  extra days to prepare for this game after beating a tough Bulls team by  on Wednesday.Hawks should win huge and cover the spread easily. I am putting . units being the Hawks making this my largest bet of the season!San Antonio Spurs . | Betting . unitsKeys to the pick Not many teams can say they have beaten the Spurs on their home court in recent years. Fewer teams can say they have beat the Spurs more than once in a single season. Houston snuck out a win in San Antonio early this week which is the rd straight time the Rockets beat the Spurs in their first meeting of the year. In meetings  to  the Spurs are  in the last  seasons covering the spread  times. Parker gave the Spurs the spark they needed last night getting a much needed win at home. Parker only logged in  minutes and shouldnt have any issues going back to back.  The Rockets last game was against the Spurs on Wednesday and they should be well rested. However the Spurs are a tough team to beat even when rested. Harden lead the team in minutes points rebounds and assist on Wednesday. Clearly the game plan will be to limit Harden as much as they can which may be an easier task when Popovich is coach. After all Popovich has done well against then Rockets following the first game in the last  seasons and they dont have Howard or Terrance Jones anymore. I like the Spurs to win this one against the small spread.Miami Heat . | Betting . unitsKeys to the pick Utah Jazz have played  road games in the last  days. Not many teams in the NBA will have to hurdle this schedule but regardless its one of the toughest schedules to play in. The Jazz have been successful so far going  but majority of those teams have had losing records. The Heat just played an emotional game against Wade and the Bulls. Now that is past them they can focus on the rest of the season. The Heat have had a lot more time off over the last week playing on just Monday and Thursday. They should be a bit more prepared for this game. The Heat are  at home this season and they are a better team than their record shows. Whiteside has been a beast inside this season and look for him to cause problems on both sides of the court. Hayward Gobert and Favors all logged in at least  minutes last night and the fatigue can very likely kick on today with the amount of games theyve played in the past week. I like the Heat tonight.Danwww.danthebettingman.comSocial MediaampnbspInstagram |Twitter |Facebook,sportsbook,d9xpj89,1,t5_2s3v4

9668706,0,t3_5di6s2,Western Sydney Wanderers v Melbourne City  A League from BettingPreviews.comWestern Sydney Wanderers come into the game with Melbourne City missing their top scorer Santalab who picked up an injury in the loss against Melbourne Victory last weekend. Bulut will come into the team to replace him in what should be one of only two changes made by Tony Popovic with the other seeing Neville come back into the defence in place of Hamill. The loss last time out saw them extend their run without a win to four having drawn their three previous games. Popovic will be looking for his side to find a victory as they look to improve on their current th place standing where they sit  points behind leaders and biggest rivals Sydney FC. They have shown good attacking potential but need to score more to pick up points. Melbourne City will be able to welcome back Brattan to their starting eleven this week as he returns from international duty. His return is likely to see head coach Vant Schip make changes to his team with Kilkenny taking up a more defensive role and Malik dropping to the bench once again. The attacking half of the team should remain the same however with Fornaroli the top scorer with  in . They beat Newcastle Jets  last weekend and whilst their first half saw a blistering attacking performance the second saw a totally different approach and they failed to even register a shot almost letting their lead slip away. Theyll need to be more ruthless in the final third making sure they win games and continue to create chances even when they are in the lead.Prediction Melbourne City .Odds .

9807751,0,t3_5fnwxg,Its is mathematically one of the least valuable numbers that is usually within range of a teaser on an NFL game. Very few games end with a score difference of  and even less end in ties so youre not getting very good value for the points youre buying.To illustrate this look at Dimes right now if you have an account there. The Eagles are listed as a PK  against the Bengals. Alternatively you can bet the Eagles  at  or . at  so you can effectively buy that point or point and a half for   gt  or  cents  gt  respectively.Alternatively the Dolphins are listed at   but if you want . you have to lay .

Using another key number the Seahawks are   or . .Different points have different values in the NFL and among the least valuable of these points are   and .

They lost Kante the backbone of the team but that is no excuse for the way theyve been playing this season. Last weekend theyve beaten Manchester City  without Aguero Fernando amp Otamendi but Lecister were also without Drinkwater who was serving a suspension. Hes back for the game against Bornemouth. I really do believe lecister have gained a tremendous amount of confidence after their huge victory against City. This will be a very entertaining game to watch. I personally am betting  to win  because firstly I am a savage and secondly I just feel that the win last weekend boosted their confidence. Simpson however is suspended due to the yellow he picked up against City. Another bet that I will be placing on this game is what TMussolani said. Over . goals. Good luck boys.  Edit as stated above I am a savage. I just threw  to win  on a parlay for Lecister and Brighton amp Hove Albion to win. Im up  from last week if I lose itll suck but wont hurt me.

10003231,0,t3_5ir2gy, ON COWBOYS PARLAYS LAST THREE GAMESIve done in depth analysis on Cowboys games for the last  games and and im on a hot streak . Lets milk this cash cow together! The following are my findings for Week  versus the red hot Buccaneers.Initial thoughts At first glance I would have hopped on the Bucs bandwagon almost immediately. Theyre on a  game win streak for gods sake! And the cowboys are looking subpar lately and only dropping  on the Giants! What is this madness???? ALL IN BUCS.The Breakdown Bucs Now im not discrediting the Bucs here they are a good team. But ill just leave it at that. They are a good team not a great team. The Bucs Last five opponents have a combined record of ... Slightly under  This one is of special importance None of the teams the Buccs have beated in the L have been rush heavy teams in terms of ydsG Saints  Chargers  Seahawks  Chiefs Bears . This leads to the ultimate game deciding question Can the Buccs stuff the  Rushing team in their own home behind one of the best offensive lines with no injuries and an explosive running back? I personally dont think so.   Given what i said above Dak will now be in an indoor stadium where the  degree forecasted arlington weather and wind will not be a factor as it was in the Giants game. Dak tends to perform well whenever Zeke catches fire and i believe this will be one of those games.The Boys The Cowboys have looked subpar in their last  games and many people have said that Dak needs to be replaced with Romo. I still believe this Dallas roster is one of the best that has ever played out of Dallas teams The Boys Last  teams have a combined records of exactly  One factor that has directly contributed to Dallas games are the ability to protect the QB. The Buccs are tied with none other than the giants in Sacks given this season. However against the top  pass rushing teams Dallas has played they have won by an average margin of pts . This is a shaky statistic though but it just comes to show that even though the Buccs pass rush is great they could still lose by more than . Final ThoughtsWhat i have given are just a few of the findings i have. One could argue for either team but in my opinion through in depth analysis i would say Vegas odds at  are right on point. If and this is a huge IF the Buccs can stop the cowboys run game then they will cover the spread. I personally dont think they can and we have all seen the cowboys and how they perform when the run game opens up. The Buccs are good but the Cowboys will play better.Final Bet Cowboys ML Over.Final Score Buccs  Cowboys TLDR the Spread is actually accurate and is not an easy Buccs Pick. Take the Boys on the ML. The game will likely go over.,sportsbook,dbbg79h,2,t5_2s3v4

10214395,0,t1_dc1scqt,Thanks you for giving a well thought response bwc.What I do and this is a personal preference is to live bet during the nd half. Why? because I already had enough time to see the fluctuations of the ou line and decide which one I want. Yesterdays game was for a long time giving me a ou line for around  points. I then decided that the opening line . was about right for a win it was lost by son of a half point in the end as you guys know... I waited to have some cushion . points at least and sure got lucky because they had a couple of minutes where they hit a couple of triples and then placed my bet. I agree this way I will probably miss a lot of WINs but will also skip a lot of loses. I think you are into something and splitting your bet might be a smart way to do it.

My thought process is that if Clemson scores at least  this game is definitely going over. I think theres a very very good chance of that happening. It also wouldnt surprise me to see Bama hang  which almost guarantees an over hit also.

10299569,0,t3_5ngovq,Straight Bets All Straight Bets are  unitNotre Dame  A true playa mac would hit dis one on da MLNotre Dame in my opinion is one of the best teams in the country. They have several individuals on this team that really want to win each and every game. Notre Dame is  and at the beginning of a  game road stretch including Miami Virginia Tech and Florida State. Coach Brays men will go into this knowing they will need to pick up probably  Ws on this road trip if they want to contend for a conference title and that this game definitely needs to be one of the two. Miami is no slouch however they were exposed by Syracuse in the Carrier Dome recently. Miami remains unbeaten at home although this will be by far the best competition to set foot in the Watsco Center this season. Overall Notre Dame just has better players who play harder at each position. This is a conference road game though and anything can happen.Purdue .I think Iowa simply wont have enough firepower for this one. The two teams have met once this season  Purdue which resulted in a  point Purdue win. Iowa may do a bit better defensively since theyve seen Purdue once but Swanigan Haas and the point shooting of Purdues guards should be too much for Iowa here. Another factor in this bet is the fact that Iowas home court has been no fortress this season. They have yielded losses to Seton Hall and NebraskaOmaha both of which do not compare to Purdue by any means. If anything Seton Halls big man play is similar to Purdues and that really gave Iowa problems. The Hawkeyes have managed to take down Iowa State and an underachieving Michigan squad at home so they should be able to hang for a bit but Purdue should pull away and win by  if they keep their composure.Gonzaga .We dont wanna be taking all road teams do we? Hell naw. So were looking to Gonzaga to give us a little Blowout City Baby. The Zags have been posting highscoring double digit wins all season long. Last time the Zags were at home they rolled Portland up into a joint and smoked em by . South Dakota got it even worse by  just the week before. A good midmajor in Akron came in and got stomped by . Loyola has played some decent competition and held their own but tonight it should all be about Gonzaga. No doubt in my mind that the Zags should win by . Its just a matter if they are in the mood for an ass whipping tonight. Cincinnati Weve got us a showdown for the top spot in the American Conference in Cincinnati tonight folks. A sellout crowd is expected at Fifth Third Arena where Cincy is  so far this season. SMU is a quality team coming off of  straight wins however they have only played four true road games this season  two against average competition in USC and Boise one against a subpar ECU squad and once against a decent Memphis team. SMU came up short in both Los Angeles and Boise though they were able to snag wins in Memphis and  ECU. I dont think any of these contests have prepared SMU for what they are going to see tonight and I still feel that SMU is maybe being overvalued by the books. At the end of the day this is a massive conference game for both in which I just think Cincy will pull away late to strengthen their hold on the American Conference.UCLA Another road team. Something I dont usually do but I just cant see UCLA coming away with anything less than a nice  point win on the road at Colorado. The Buffs are another team that are no slouch at home but theyve recently lost  in a row against competition that is nowhere near in the same league as UCLA. UCLA leads the nation in Effective FG and Colorado is in the bottom half of the country. I think that stat alone is very telling and I think the shooting of UCLA will be too much for Colorado to handle.East Tennessee State .ETSU is having a fantastic season and statistically they have been playing excellent basketball. Yesterdays statsbased pick was Dayton and that did not go well. Hopefully we can get much better production today from ETSU. ETSU is rated FAR higher than UNCGreensboro in nearly every statistical category. In fact offensive rebounding seems to be one of the very few places where UNCG has the edge however I will credit this to their low shooting . ETSU is coming off of a point road win against Mercer which is a team that I value highly and will be looking to continue their dominance in SOCON play. Freedom Hall should be loud and proud for the Bucs this evening and I expect ETSU to play the same kind of basketball that propelled them to blowout wins over VMI and the Citadel and that allowed them to take a nice win at Mercer by .Todays Parlay Risking .u to Win uWisconsin ML  Middle Tennessee ML  Purdue ML  California ML  UCLA ML  St. Marys ML  We hit yesterdays parlay. If youre going to do parlays then ML is the way to go in my opinion. Just do a straight pick em. Thats what been giving me success lately. I say that and well probably miss all parlay picks today lol. Thats just how it goes though. Hopefully our ML favorites can take care of business tonight. That being said I do not have anywhere near the confidence for this parlay as last nights so keep that in mind if youre tailing or basing some picks off of this. Extra TipThere are a LOT of road favorites today. I do not like taking many road favorites unless they are VERY good teams overall. With this in mind I have a feeling that some VERY VALUABLE home dogs will win outright tonight. A perfect example of this from last night was Boston College. I almost put u on them and damn I should have. Also Mercer but they were a road dog so well leave them out here. Someone made the point yesterday that in CBB the home team usually wins. This is VERY true. Home teams play better at home and the refs usually help em out a lot too. Just wanted to say this because I see some possible upsets coming tonight but probably wont play them myself as they are risky. Dogs I like Eastern Kentucky  Morehead State  UWMilwaukee .,sportsbook,dcbifqu,7,t5_2s3v4

Phillys lack of athletic wing defenders will get absolutely abused by Milwaukees athletic players Giannis Jabari and even some Beasley off the bench and Brogdon will have his way against the weak Philly point guards. Phillys errorprone and  point shooting offense will struggle against Milwaukees defense which defends their strengths well. Milwaukee takes care of business here with a  point victory.Key Stats Milwaukee averages the th most points off turnovers . points per  possessions while Philly gives up the th most . points. On a similar note Philly commits the most turnovers per  possessions in the NBA . while Milwaukee is th and th in steals and blocks per .  Bucks score the th most FBPs per  . while Philly gives up nd most .. Philly is the th most reliant team in the NBA on the three ball while Milwaukee is th best at defending it.Golden State   UnitsEight points is a huggggeeeeeee margin but one I see Golden State covering at the Oracle. LeBron and crew are not in the best of form as of recent and I think Golden State gets their revenge for a Christmas game that they absolutely gave away. Key Stats Cleveland is the nd most reliant team on the three ball in the NBA with . of their points coming from beyond the arc. Their offensive attack will have to change as Golden State is by far the Associations best three point defending team allowing teams to shoot just . from three. Golden State meanwhile is the th most reliant team from three while Cleveland is just a middle of the road team at defending the three ball.  Warriors are a top  team per  possessions in the categories of FBPs PITP and Pts. off turnovers while Cavs dont necessarily thrive defensively in any of these areas. Pelicans   UnitsMore of a gutcall here than anything. This is a game the Pelicans won by  earlier in the season and they have only gotten better since. Myles Turner had a huge night against Davis in that first matchup and I think that does not happen again. This game should be a gritty game that stays close throughout as the Pacers look to rally after that embarrassing loss to Denver so Im taking the prior winner and the  points..Key Stats Pacers are the th most reliant team in the NBA on the MR shot and the Pelicans defend it very well  while the Pelicans are the th best at defending it.

10468168,0,t1_dctqio3,Really good analysis and I like both picks. However I disagree with your Ricky Rubio point and this is whytl dw Rubio is a great passer but his inability to be a threat from midrange makes it easier for their opponent to defend Minnesota. I actually think they play better without him. Just some food for thought..,sportsbook,dcuo9og,2,t5_2s3v4

10505090,0,t3_5qen3b,NBA K Experiment Overall Record Total Record  Yesterday Spread Record  Yesterday Tracking SpreadsheetDoing a lot of work on the spreadsheet tonight to set it up so everyone can see the spread differentials and total differentials easier as well as adding in a straight up column to see if it is actually predicting the game winners correct as well. I am also tracking the results relative to SD and TD on the second tab of the sheet to see if there are any trends that start to pop off.Only thing standing out so far is that overs are  but it still is really early and hopefully with more results something is going to pop off.I am currently running through the leagues and adjusting the rosters to fit the injuries and players who are out at  AM EST. If there are any Major Changes an example being the Mavs losing Dirk and other players I will re run the simulation with new adjustments made. But if it is some bench player saucing  minutes a game Im gonna let it slide. Update The simulations have been run and the results up. Not all the lines are up yet so I am cant post all that stuff on here yet but plan on doing it in the morning when all the lines are up. Just a couple of notesThe NetsCavs Spread and my simulation are exactly the same which was kind of wild. I will look for line movement and update it with a pick if the line shifts at all.Simulations organized from top to bottom based on spread differentialGrizzles  Trailblazers Average Score . to .Picks Trailblazers PK amp Over .SDTD.Kings  Pacers Average Score  to .Picks Pacers  amp Under  SD.

CavsNets HornetsKicks WizardsHawks ersRockets all fit this and all go under. So hypothetically with this trend you would fade them and pick the Over. While the data sample is really small so far just something to keep an eye on.Looking forward to updating this in the morning.

10536096,0,t3_5qri5j,Yesterday  .uSeason  .uAgain Im making these picks largely made on the model Ive just put together. Its quite basic but we got some good returns on the first night. All picks are u unless specified otherwise.NYK .   Even with Rose out my model thinks the Knicks should only be getting around  or . here. Statistically the Hawks really dont have much of a home field advantage at all as their point differential at home this season is barely positive at less than a tenth of a point per game excluding OT periods. I think the dropoff from Rose to Jennings is also quite minimal as Jennings is a little less ball dominant and at least in my eyes I live in the NY area and watch the Knicks a lot a slightly better defender. Knicks have also kept all three earlier games with the Hawks this season close as theyve won one lost another by  points in OT and lost the third by  point. DAL .   My model has this closer to Spurs  or . so I think there is value with Dallas here. Mavericks have played the Spurs relatively slightly this season losing by  in San Antonio and by  in Dallas. Both of those games took place in late November and I would say that Dallas has slightly elevated their game since then going from bottom feeders to a slightly below average team. I also think that Carlisle even when outmatched by the Spurs likes to give it his all against them although I dont have numbers to back that claim up just memories of their st round playoff series a few years ago when the  seed Mavericks pushed the  seed Spurs to  games. Finally both teams are within the bottom  of possessions per game which means this should be a slow game and that should make it a bit tougher for the Spurs to cover a big spread.I also have a slight lean on POR  but I dont think I have enough deodorant in my house to sweat out a cover against the Warriors. Good luck!,sportsbook,dd2dsn1,1,t5_2s3v4

Oral Roberts is an Over Machine especially at home.  They have been averaging giving up  a game in conference play.  Their past  in a row at home have hit over this number.  They are playing one of the more potent offenses in the Summit in Denver who has no issue scoring on the road. I expect about  from Denver meaning all ORU needs is  to cover.  This is also their rd game in  daysTulane H U . UTulane has gone under this H total  of their last .  Their last  first halves they have scored   and  respectively.  Good value here.Rutgers U  UIowa may have a weak D but the burden here is def on Rutgers who hasnt broke  points in  games.RutgersIowa H U  URutgers also plays really strong D at home very strong in the st half.  Combine this with an impotent offense and I think the H total will be closer to  than Depaul  UGeorgetown hasnt beat a team on the road by more than  yet.  DePaul has given Nova a scare almost beat Butler at home recently and beat Providenxe at homeDepaul ML  .UManhattanFairfield U  UTwo slumping teams Manhattan has scored  or under the last  in a row.

U WPOTD Minnesota Wild ML  .UWhile Im not as confident about tonights slate as some of the others on this sub I do like the Wild playing at home tonight for half a unit. Dubnyk is confirmed which is always huge and I totally agree with the line of thinking that Wild will be hungry to keep pace with the Blackhawks after taking a tough loss from them and this is a matchup on paper that makes a lot of sense. Everything on paper makes sense and the Wild look the part of a better team I just have kind of a iffy feeling on this one that relegates it to half a unit play. Im gonna be posting a couple cawlidge hockey plays in the NHL thread so feel free to check that out if yal are hungry. Much bigger slate saturday that we can shell out some more units on hopefully!POTN Record  for .ULast POTN Denmark ML .U LPOTN DenmarkJapan Under .  .U L  AM ESTStill not sure if I have the greatest feel for these games so buyer beware I will feel a ton more confident about my KHL picks in the future but looking at these rosters I cant help but get a feeling that both of these teams strengths fall in their backlinesgoal tending. This is backed up by a lot of their recent games against similar competition being low scoring as well as the nature of european and asian I guess hockey. Sold half a goal to eliminate a push on a  game but I do kinda like this pick for what it is. Dont bet the house on it but it can be a fun late night play.Update Have a brutal feel for this tournament. Denmark scoring  goals in  periods feels unreal figuring the terrible offensive performance theyve mustered up against South Korea. Either there is a huge talent differential between the top two and bottom two or this was just an absolutely brutal display by Japan. Either way I want POTN to be a real winner for people much like my POTDs. So I think either Im going to take a couple days off till KHL action starts back up or cheat a little bit and post some AM area Finish league games. But taking some random meaningless couple games is really a waste of money even if theyre little half U plays. I will still post my thoughts on this tournament and hopefully turn it around cause sometimes its fun to play the tiniest bit of a unit on a random game at night. But I do plan on my POTN project on being serious and profitable and this is really not the way to roll it out.More importantly lets get it back with the POTD!Best of luck! I think I have  POTDs in a row? Lets keep it rolling!!!,sportsbook,ddk65iv,9,t5_2s3v4

Its been  mins since I locked in Wizards  and its already gone to .. Washington Wizards .  U vs Indiana Pacers The wizards have been playing incredible recently and with the Celtics winning tonight are going to want to finish off the first half of the season strong. They are a LeBron James shot of the year and a Marcus Morris buzzer beater away from going  in their past  games.  During this  game stretch when the Wizards win they win big. Theyve won their games by an average of . points. Theyre playing at the Pacers who just suffered a tough loss to the Cavs tonight. This is now their th straight loss and theyre about to play a super hot team on a back to back. They might be starting to make their vacation plans as the all star break starts after this game.  Boston Celtics   U vs  Chicago Bulls ML isnt out but my guess is  when ML comes out tomorrow the line will have shifted a lot your choice if you want to wait to see line movement.I think the Celtics see Love going down and really feel like they have a chance at catching cleveland for the  seed in the East.  They are going to want to finish off the sweep on this back to back against a Bulls team that has been very mediocre all season while the locker room is in turmoil.

Yes we can argue that Ivo wasnt playing his best tennis Isner as well and Opelka just being Opelka. But I like Young over T.Frtiz maybe Im being bias but I dont see anything I can say positive about Frtiz currently. What I see is a inconsistent young player basically an Opelka jr it helps they are actually good friends the style of play is similar but Fritz doesnt have that big serve.

10995293,0,t3_5x09x1,LCK itaKT vs SKTOh boy here we go. KT has looked relatively weak when they are playing behind or not in a complete even match up. Their starbest player is obviously Score with Mata calling the shots. Everyone hereshould know each players so Im not going to go too much into detail  I do however prefer Pawnsplay style when going against Faker.Kt as a general make lots of mistakes and from time to time I see some weird mixed shot calling fromMataSmeb. We do have to talk about how flawless they were against Samsung so  but there needs to bea small asterisk on it. Samsung players made some horrendous mistakes that game  just god awful plays.I dont know how SKT will start the bp  because giving Deft his Varus is too much of a risk. We seeteams trading KhaRengarGraves but know that  even though Korean junglers dont rate Ivern  Scorecan play her.  Both teams had a rest week  and I honestly think the Ivern pick here would be absolutely great  especially against SKT. Score is a jungler who is incredibly intelligent  who paths his route minutes before andalways looks to get into the enemy jungle camps so I wont be surprised if he plays Ivern today.Longzhu vs MVPRematch of the series two days ago. The point still stands from that write up  I see a prettyeven match up but I would really prefer Add to stick with anything other than Maokai. I know they losta pretty bad game when he played the Jayce but that was just an unfortunate counter gank from Crashthat snow balled way out control.  I did not like them target banning the bot  I rather personally see them target Crashes pool  because GoPray can play anything. Mvp will have the red sideso they can counter the Flys unusual champions.Slightly again lean with Longzhu. The pools that MVP will have to against  bot  mid is just too much of an advantage for LzOh right forgot to mention this  Lz splitted ways with SSong  and Hirai said that BDD is ready to play  and has been ready to jump in for  series now so thats worth a mention.Bad day yesterday  honestly all my fault.

11093331,0,t3_5ycgsh,SOOO psyched for today! This is the secondbest Thursday of the college basketball season! Work was cancelled high winds in the area and Im off to the casino with the boys to watch some Big Ten Tournament action and gamble on cubes! Ive held off for the most part this week but had a big day yesterday and Im ready to unload today. So in addition to riding the wave on a soccer pick I know nothing about heres what I have UNITSMSU .  I have confidence in my Spartans to pound an exhausted Penn State team today by double digits. Iowa covered against PSU last weekend and MSU is better than Iowa. This line is skewed because MSU lost to PSU in Philadelphia in January due to injuries and HCA  a nearly meaningless result here. Im happy to take this one. W GO GREEN! UNITS EACHGeorgia .  Tennessee is so bad right now itll be a wonder if the starting five dont somehow injure themselves during warmups. WIndiana   Im aware theyre not playing at earlyseason levels. But against a mercurial Iowa team on a neutral floor they just have way more talent. I anticipate a close game but I guaranfriggintee that Indiana wont get blown out and could easily win by double digits. Expect them to show up for Coach Crean and keep their tourney dream alive. W Nevada   Nevadas been money for me this season. Going to keep going to the well against inferior competition. W units clean sweep!! UNIT EACHTexas San Antonio   I dont love betting against Middle Tennessee but thats a loooot of points for a conference tournament and you know MTSU is going to get every teams best shot. PUSHDuke   Louisvilles fine. Dukes fine. Its a tossup and Ill take Coach K as an underdog in a tournament situation against any team thats not far superior e.g. North Carolina  sorry Duke humps. Edit Line moved the other way on this one so you can take Duke getting more points if you like. WTemple   Tailing another poster for this one. ECU is bad and Temple should be able to control the game. LSouth Florida   See UTSA pick. South Florida is bad but  is a lot of points against a UConn team that has underwhelmed at every opportunity. I doubt theyll be able to pull away from anybody. WProvidence   Creightons best ball is behind them and Providence is just starting to roll. LLets get em boys!

In other words basically track your bets and never bet over  of your bankroll unless its just for fun and you fully acknowledge what you are doing. Also like in investing in betting it is also important to DIVERSIFY your bets so dont put all eggs in the same basket so to speak.

11189419,0,t3_5zndqd,Since I havent seen it posted yet heres my thoughts on todays CSGO ESL EU Proleague matchesNavi v Fnaticmap  train      Navimap  Mirage     NaviFnatic had a very convincing victory on train yesterday over VP who has been a solid train team forever. I missed the game due to being at work so I dont know whether its because Fnatic is that good on train or VP did their usual throw win  that we see with their online play. Either way Navi has relied on train as a map pick with this new roster quite heavily so I give them a slight edge here.Mirage is home turf for Navi who are arguably the best team on that map along with VP and SK. Mirage is definitely the safer bet of the two.Astralis v Heroicmap  Nuke  Astralismap  Inferno    AstralisAstralis really showed us just how good their Nuke is yesterday with their T side play against North. Heroic a team who has pulled quite a few upsets lately is also a very solid Nuke team. I think though many people underestimated Heroic and didnt give them the respect they deserve. Now that Heroic is no longer under the radar I expect Astralis to show up. All that being said I could see Nuke going either way. Inferno on the other hand should go to Astralis. They have solid results on this map while Heroic have  data on it. Heroic COULD have practiced it but thats really not of that much value until its been tested by a top tier team.LDLC v Mousesportsmap  Cobble    Mousemap  Nuke      MouseThis is a weird match up. LDLC has shown some signs of solid play but then loses to trash teams sorry for honesty. Mouse who I expected to nose dive after Nikos departure has actually done alright. Oskar is actually pretty unreal and in my opinion one of the most underrated players at the moment. Try and find a game where he isnt top of the team its actually really tough. Regarding maps though cobble is an LDLC favorite they love to play it and have consistently decent results on it. Mouse on the other hand have very little data on it with only a slight edge over Kinguin anything in the Niko era is not valid data. Anyone who saw that game knows Mouse probably should have lost. That being said they did  North recently so their form seems to be good. I think LDLC is a better Cobble team but Mouse is a better team overall so ill put cobble as a coin flip. Nuke has been a sore spot for LDLC with their only recent win against HellRaisers who had a stand in..not exactly convincing. Mouz also lack Nuke play but I believe with both teams lacking strategy depth we will see Mouz coming out on top as they are the better team individually.North v EnvyUsmap  Nuke      Northmap  Cobble    NorthNorth one of the early adapters of Nuke have always played the map well. It suits their structured style of play while Envy a new pugesque style of team atleast for now will likely lack the T side to pull through on this map. I think North takes nuke but with the fire power on Envy I could see Envy stealing this one. Cobble should be more  sided. North played this map to death at Katowice and are very comfortable on it while Envy lost to HR  and BIG  in the past  cobble matches. edit typo,sportsbook,df0b2qh,2,t5_2s3v4

11229516,0,t3_607pa7,Current Bankroll Starting Bankroll  on March th Profit My strategy for March Madness is In Game arbitrage betting on games that I feel are providing value. Anyone can bet on how they think each game will play out but as soon as its tip off anything can happen. By watching how each team executes their game plan effectively seeing how the bench performs whos hitting their shots and by watching the In Game Moneyline we can maximize our profit and minimize our losses.Bet Covered   on Bovada on WichitaGuaranteed profit of  no matter who winsBet Placed  on Kentucky I typically wait until the game starts to place these bets but I feel that Wichita will be exposed early in the game by the rebounding and offensive power of Kentucky. True Wich has been hot but they really havent done too well in matchups vs Power  Conference teamsMan oh man what a March Madness. I received a comment yesterday that mentioned I cant make a living off of bets this small  and I totally agree with himher. No one is buying steak dinners with  wins except at Sizzler. What I dont want to do however is put myself in a position where I find myself using a system thats been profitable for me  but I get on tilt with betting amounts that are too large for me to feel comfortable with. There are so many factors that go into play to be successful at sports betting and it takes one bad day on tilt to lose everything. Weve all had that feeling. Take your time.

The line was Suns . or whatever and that line got bet because people thought it was a smart wager. If the bookmakers left it there it would presumably continue to get bet and would leave them open to a significant exposure there. So they start moving it down from . to  . making the Suns wager less attractive. Looking at it from the other side they moved the Clippers from . to . i.e. they made that wager more attractive. Eventually the line will settle into a place where hypothetically there is no value in betting on either side. ,sportsbook,dfmede7,2,t5_2s3v4

Almiron played in the second half of the  Draw against the Sounders. ATL has  goals in their  matches this season. Granted  came against Minnesota. Still no Martinez.

Crystal Palace is my favorite EPL team that could double as a strip club name who are often too erratic for me to put value behind. But they are playing a Leicester team who will undoubtedly be sitting their big dogs to prepare for the huge Champion League nd round vs. Atletico next week. Defender and captain Wes Morgan has officially been left off the roster and VardyDrinkwaterothers are expected to follow. On the other side Crystal Palace are winners of  of their last  games. Forwards Zaha and Benteke are extremely fast and put pressure on defenses. Their problem until recently is finishing. Their D should be able to contain the squad the Foxes are going to field and I think they will find the net a few times. ABSOLUTE banker. Ride. The. Wave.
