5985999,0,t3_3xfrlq,You might want to try it after customizing your gun. It worked wonders for me. ,GITS_FA,cy4ansa,3,t5_39z28

7445620,0,t3_4gkd5i,Bought it because I could try it this weekend would have never thought about buying it otherwise.Next best thing to old Blacklight Retribution.,GITS_FA,d2oipui,1,t5_39z28
7936447,0,t1_d482lus,Ive been playing for about without an issue and Ive never heard of crashing. Still its prerelease so there could be issues...,GITS_FA,d484r39,1,t5_39z28
7936818,0,t1_d484uhy,Yea its hosed up ATM. Im pretty sure the influx of players from the Humble Bundle was too much for the servers.,GITS_FA,d48695c,1,t5_39z28
8007269,0,t3_4oujt1,Great jobDPS would probably be a very useful stat to include as well,GITS_FA,d4g3cc4,2,t5_39z28
8559802,0,t3_4x0qrx,This vidoe is really conflicting me. Im playing this game for a while with Friends and we are having a Blast. Even after quite a few hours i did not encounter hitreg issus like Seen in your Video.,GITS_FA,d6bjw1n,2,t5_39z28
8578172,0,t3_4x9xek,gt  this happens actually pretty often.I actually dont see the issue here. The player on Ghost A is totally dominating even though Ghost B has the  next most skilled players in the room. Unless you mean that the system shouldnt put you in rooms with less skilled players  but that will mean making people wait a long time for a match if there are not a large enough pool of high skilled players online.,GITS_FA,d6dusw7,3,t5_39z28
8633776,0,t1_d6kdgnt,Shotguns were always good but they got better after the update and those new mods.There are definitely some maps where shotguns are bad on but they are pretty strong most of the time.,GITS_FA,d6ktv2n,1,t5_39z28
8870357,0,t3_51r0t2,seriously when the actual fuck are they going to fix this garbage? im forced into  shitty lobby the whole time those assholes are playing. ,GITS_FA,d7e3bjq,1,t5_39z28
8886705,0,t1_d7g1m7u,except Im not you and my experience isnt yours. I live on a coast. so one server is great the other is very very bad. they arent both ok. how do you browse the servers? all I found were custom games. which were utter shit for the most part and theres like  lobbies. ,GITS_FA,d7g21ef,1,t5_39z28
9103965,0,t3_54z058,They do have hp.  Also there is no damage fall of from range in the firing range so that explains it.  I dont know what the MD damage is but it maybe is like  stock does it kill on limb shots in range stockor with barrel?  If it does it would probably actually be a bad idea to use a CBC  I think.   ,GITS_FA,d865fbf,2,t5_39z28

10227256,0,t3_5mf13p,The metagame.If they really want to bring more potential customers in the next thing they might want to do is either bring a new metagame or change the existing metagame. Adding new weapons is cool and all but between buying the next newest thing and getting headshotted across the map with an SMG I think Id prefer changing the gun mechanics.,GITS_FA,dc3betu,3,t5_39z28
10346823,0,t1_dcge9q7,Right? It almost feels weird taking control of an AI personality. Did they ultimately take away the ability to hack the tachikoma though? It didnt seem like there was anyone doing that o,GITS_FA,dcgvedf,2,t5_39z28
10803754,0,t1_ddua7pu,I dont think its fair to compare this to a moba style game as the player bases are two whole different animals for the FP genre. Mobas are expected to be free and are thus much more accepted in the community.Free FPS games have a huge stigma For very good reason might I add in there own community. It would take alot more effort to prove itself worthy especially being funded by Nexon.None the less its doable for sure. They need to concentrate on keeping their current player base happy while Polishing the game up and taking in feedback. k online every day is enough for a game to last trough beta phases plenty of people to play with.Then they need to really market the launch hard. Sponsor videos for big gamer YouTube stars get medias to review your launch game make a deal with valve to get on the front page for atleast a week put some good trailers out showing off your unique mechanics and putting emphasis on the very polishedinstant feel of the gun combat.... This game is good market it like one.If they fail to do any of it they will be done for. You dont get a nd launch and you dont save money on it. Dirty Bomb is a great example of that failure. Though the game play and maps in that game are way too claustrophobic that it was never going to work anyway..... It could of still been such a bigger splash Pun intended considering the history it had and the prestige of the company. They failed on so many levels at launch been losing players ever since.Edit This is all under the assumption its not keeping its beta tag for years as an excuse. If thats the case this game would have to overcome even more obstacles without an excuse for them to spend money advertising and getting old players to retry the game.,GITS_FA,ddubxj0,1,t5_39z28
