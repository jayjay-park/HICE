6870649,0,t1_d0ujuh9,I dont think you understand what this biome does to my game. I got killed by a zombie at  fps. Thats why I burned it down. I have them all around my base so whenever i go exploring I have to pass through one or right by one and it isnt fun. The best part was that it replanted itself almost as fast as i could get it down thanks to the self planting sapling thing which i previously liked P ,LifeInTheWoods,d0v3lbw,1,t5_319zf

7061315,0,t1_d1gr4qp,Yeah i wait with the good recipes FOR MY STUPID ASS EXPLORATION UNTIL I EXPLORED SOMETHING! Maybe i am ridiculous to you but neither are u helpfull for this thread. Thanks for your participationEditIm not even supposed to explore. I like to gather all necessary ressources and then start building usefull things to make my life in minecraft as easy as possible. I rarely move more than  blocks away from my home except a mine is taking me somewhere far away.

7130619,0,t3_4d83n5,Thanks for the responses.  I think Im going to download it in a little bit.

10809418,0,t3_5ue7us,The xms parameter sets the initial Java heap size. Maybe  gigs are just to much for the initialization. You should try and change the XmsG parameter to XmxG. This will allow the JVM get up to  Gigabyte of RAM if needed.,LifeInTheWoods,dduwycy,1,t5_319zf
