Make sure you hire a safecracker  not a locksmith.  Yes there is a big difference between the two. Be sure and ask if they are familiar with this type of key lock before letting them touch your safe. If they need to drill the safe make sure they have the skill level needed before letting someone learn on your property.

Maybe try a larger diameter but thinner metal cutoff disk they can reach pretty deep and take much less effort to cut through metal.  You can pick one up from about any hardware store.  Be sure to wear eye protection ideally a full face shield.  They are scary but effective.  Edit  Then when you get close get a big pry bar under there and go nuts.  ,WhatsInThisThing,czmrb73,10,t5_2wn3k

Only thing you have to do is bury them deep enough so animals cant dig them up.I keep the memories in my head and in the form of pictures a grave is just a place where an empty thing is buried. Just because I dont care for where the cat is buried or dont pick the perfect spot doesnt mean I didnt respect the cat when it was alive.It is better however to bury any animal in a towel of sorts so it can decompose better.
