3454699,0,t1_cpm1hv0,Mine has been raised from a puppy with our cats. We had  down to  now. The one that is no longer with us taught our houla that cats are not play toys. She was a fierce kitty. So my yr old Catahoula knows not to get too close but she still wants them to run so she can chase them. You can see the disappointment in her face when the fat one wont react to her. Its kind of funny. She isnt bad with them but no where near letting them rub on her. ,Catahoula,cpm28mm,1,t5_2t1g0

8134887,0,t3_4qik3d,I live in town and have a good sized yard. My key to victory is doggy daycare. She gets to run around and play. When she gets home at night she mostly wants to cuddle. We still go for walks and play in the yard but it is not a dire necessity.     If you can afford to do the daycare thing you should be good. If you cant then you need to be ready for a life that is strictly workdog,Catahoula,d4ufo6y,1,t5_2t1g0

10399104,0,t3_5ov4j7,My Catahoula is great with kiddos! I would take her to babysit my toddler nephew and she watched him like a hawk and was very interested in his safety. She only napped when he napped. Pretty cute actually. The only downside is that mine is a licker and not all kids are okay with that. ,Catahoula,dcmszni,2,t5_2t1g0
10533320,0,t3_5qs82b,Ok thank you!! Makes me feel validated somehow lol! Ive never really noticed other dogs doing it and wondered if it was a Catahoula thing ,Catahoula,dd22gof,1,t5_2t1g0
