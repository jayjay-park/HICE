4322020,0,t1_cs5kz22,gt Like most of my experiences on Reddit this is what I get for trying.If you got down voted in here it wasnt a hivemind thing. It seems that  you didnt spot that this was a vegan sub when you popped in to help. Thats fine but bear in mind that the locals are very used to people popping in to troll some idiots put a stupid amount of effort into hooking us in so a sudden and dont forget the eggs is bound to piss a few people off. We cant know that you are just being friendly because to us it seems obvious that a vegan recipe was asked for even if it turns out that it wasnt so obvious to outsiders.Hope that helps ,veganize,csctju1,1,t5_34e29
