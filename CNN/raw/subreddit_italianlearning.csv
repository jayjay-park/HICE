It is used to teach Italian to young people as they begin the process of integration. This evening I burned a new copy of my Italian Numbers CD. Im trying to train my ear to catch the numbers through repetition. So I have combined several videos and audio sources onto one CD. Extracting the audio from video was a technical challenge. Then I had to splice  audio files together to get a complete count from  to . Still had some issues with audio levels and missing files so I had to burn it again this evening.,italianlearning,cghpzem,1,t5_2tuxf

One important thing this page mentions is congiuntivo esortativo Its like the imperative but for the third person and is mostly used with the Lei form to express a command towards a person formally.  SE NE VADA! You couldnt do it with imperative as it only has nd singular and nd plural forms. VAI! ANDATE! and the formal Lei requires the verb in the rd person singolar. ,italianlearning,cqklw31,2,t5_2tuxf

Imparo alla lingua da un anno accademico cio sei mesi se non mi sbaglio e nellestate vorrei andare in Italia. Sar la mia prima volta.Ma ho un problema cio il visto dingresso. Non so di qual tipo di visto dovrei richiedere. C uno turistico ma io non lavoro ricevo un credito scolare dal governo turco e anche i miei mi sostengono economicamente quindi non so se me lo concederanno il visto turistico. Ma io certamente avr soldi da sostenermi in Italia per almeno un mese.  C anche un visto di studio ma io preferirei non dover attendere qualsiasi corso io voglio proprio vedere e scoprire alcuni parti del paese attendere alcuni mostre per esempio Mostra Escher presso Bologna parlare coi locali ecc. Ma se non trovo un alternativo ne richieder uno.Io penso di comprare un biglietto Interrail mensile per lItalia e usarlo per andare alle diverse parti del paese vorrei vedere la Sicilia Firenze Bologna Napoli... Dunque non voglio rimanere in una citt per settimane vorrei essere mobile e trovare alberghi durante il tragitto non voglio fare un viaggio tutto prenotato tutto pianificato. Ma mi pare che si deve presentare una prenotazione del soggiorno.Cosa faccio? Sarebbe possibile per me fare un tal viaggio o dovr prendere un corso di lingua pagandolo coi denari che senn avrei potuto spendere per un divertente mese?,italianlearning,crt4uyn,1,t5_2tuxf

That can be useful to guess how verbs are conjugated after youve seen a few. e.g. piacre giacre have the accent on the secondtolast e and they become piaccio and giacciowhile Pingere fngere dipngere lggere have the accent before the ere so they become piango fingo dipingo and leggo.The distinction is useful because these used to be  entirely different classes of verbs in latin IIRC,italianlearning,d9tk7th,1,t5_2tuxf
