You would be better performing two tests with the server responding to your upload with a message containing its own recorded time difference from connection negotiation to final byte. This would be easiest with websockets alas it doesnt have great support on older mobile devices.Plus even if you get a result you have a few complications mobile speeds are highly variable. Your user might have great speeds whilst shes waiting for a train but terrible connectivity once she gets on the vehicle and it moves. You probably dont want to be testing the users speed constantly itll use use up your network resources by necessity. theres a big difference between the speed of cold and warm connections on mobile. If the radio turns off after ms of inactivity IIRC turning it back on and going through TCP slowstart will make things very sluggish. So your user may use your download  upload functionality at a point where your earlier measurements are no longer valid. we should really be trying to make things as quick as possible regardless of our users technologyWhat exactly do you want to use this measurement for?,Frontend,cg34kv7,1,t5_2sr2y

2370761,0,t1_cm4qcau,This is an unfortunate aspect of agency work for many developers if you work with producers I assume who take on some kind of project management role and and designers who dont fully understand what theyre asking of you.  All I can say is stand your ground and be firm and realistic about time estimates for various features and dont let them take advantage of you.  As a developer the deadline is always bearing down on YOU so dont be afraid to speak up and firmly say so if people are trying to push in features at the last minute when you are strapped for time as it is.  Instead say Yes we can add this but it will take X hours of work on top of the remaining X hours we have budgeted and allocated to complete these other various tasks remaining in the project.  It also helps to explain that adding in features at a later stage particularly in crunch time when you have to kind of hack it in there just makes the codebase more messy and prone to errors and so all features should be decided upon at the beginning of the project  thats what discovery and design phases are for in the first place.

I work my  hours a day and I jealously guard my nonworking time.

When I got my current job I never bothered to stop the emails about other job offers. At first it was annoying but eventually it served as a reminder that there are other jobs out there.

Your breakpoints will still take into account the device pixel ratio so that needs to be accounted for.  Some quick ones portrait iPhone   Galaxy S  Iphone  .gt  With regards to being responsive should I be using PX units?Personally I dont think any of the options are bad.  Youre right about fonts defined in PX not changing due to browser default font size.  If youre concerned with accessibility you may want to avoid PX.ems are fine as long as you keep in mind the effects a parent element has on its children but it is one more thing you have to be thinking about.Rems are relative to the root element html so the advantage is that you declare your default font size once in px then everything else in rems.  For your media queries you just change the font size for html and everything else is taken care of.

5144320,0,t3_3lg8ay,These are generally my observations with ReactFlux versus Angular as well.I found it easier to get started with Angular as its opinionated and theres a specific way to do things. However once your Angular app out grows most trivial usecases the data flow can get tangled fast. Also while the initial start up time with Angular is quick once you start having to write your own directives things slow way back down.Now that Flux architecture is becoming more widely used with React things are getting more opinionated. However theres still a lot of React samples out there that dont use Flux at all which makes it confusing for people trying to get started.Even the fact that people compare Angular and React directly makes it confusing for newcomers expecting a full framework from React.,Frontend,cv630a5,14,t5_2sr2y
5144793,0,t1_cv630a5,Ive been working with Angular for a few years now and do agree  that as applications get larger the flow of data and where is my state held and what is it? can become a very confusing mess.But with some discipline and good practices  you can start to bring things into control. It is possible to use use Flux with Angular  and Ive seen a number of ways of doing it from using an existing Flux implementation to rolling their own to using libraries like RxJs to help deal with things.Ive recently started to use Redux along with Angular and its proving to be pretty great so far and excited at the way its changing my way of building applications.That said it is really easy to get into a tangled mess with Angular and many of the current examples amp tutorials out there dont really show how manage state in a more sensible way. I am using Angular . with WebPack  ESBabel and using Redux to manage my state. My application is almost getting to the point of almost UI is a function of state my controllers are little more than a ngRedux.connect statement and a scope.ondestroy to unbind things.With ES  the bulk of my application lives outside of Angular and looks like plain old JavaScript and just having an index.js that imports the modules and wraps them in angular.moduleland as needed. But its almost to the point of where so little of my code is in Angularcentric its almost like why bother with Angular? ... and well because I still like it  but excited at the potential of being able to port large parts of this project to something like React or Angular  with only needing to worry about the view layer.The redux dev tools also work with Angular although not quite as smoothly as with react but I do get the benefits of being able to persist my state so whenever I save changesetc and my browser reloads  I generally end up back exactly where I was. I can step back  replay events also  but it is a bit wonky at times not sure if its an issue with my app or how the dev tools work with Angular or a bit of both.React is great  and Im all for picking the right tool for the job and pretty impressed with how many of the concepts that drive React are impacting the JS community at large even outside of React. Its an exciting if occasionally exhausting time to be a front end developer,Frontend,cv6529u,7,t5_2sr2y

5603621,0,t1_cwrob9v,You mention relational DBs but your examples of databases are trivial examples such as the Web Storage API. WebSQL has been deprecated and indexedDB has very particular usages. This is not the sort of stuff youll find in every project. You classify Web Developers as masters of none but then you say you expect frontend devs devs to know about relational DBs i.e. SQL. A frontend dev that is interacting directly with a relational DB is not a frontend dev they are a fullstack web dev either working in fullstack JS or fullstack with different languages.While knowledge of SQL databases and backend languages is very useful for anyone interested in web development and programming it is not necessary for a junior frontend developer nor is it often listed as a job requirement. OP would also have a lot to gain from learning algorithms and data structures discrete mathematics or linear algebra depending on how he decides to specialise. There are however tons of jobs where the employer wont require OP to know any of these things. Keep in mind that in a lot of modern stacks a lot of your db logic will be abstracted by an ORM anyway.If OP wants to become a frontendUI developer a little knowledge about how the fullstack works is good but for now they should focus on what is the core of the job and thats HTMLCSSJS.

Make use of the screenreadertext class if you need to convey information that would normally be handled by visual cues andor context.

Then the client would ask for a change and Id have to unfuck all my fucked up code before I could do anything.

The line between backend programming and frontend programming is becoming a lot more blurry where backend is primarily a restful backend for data while the frontend is where most of the interaction and business logic happens now.  Its even more blurry now with universal javascript aka isomorphic javascript as you have to do both in a mixed way.  Its really fun if you like software architecture programming automation and tooling!Yes and no.  htmlcssphotoshopillustratorsassetc are hard skills that youll be using to start off your web design career but Id like to emphasize that softskills like designing itself iterating on a design with stakeholders learning about and applying design patterns and general UX design matter a lot probably more than hardskills.  Youll have plenty of opportunities to do htmlcss directly while doing the design as well businesses and tech companies cant get enough of this skillset mix.

I still however find most of them quite limiting but they have gotten very good in a short space of time. One area I liked most about Sketch is the ability to define set of components such as buttons  avatar images and save them as templates for later use. This is incredibly powerful when youre regularly designing for a preexiting application which has a set of designs already in place. You can quickly mockup a new feature which matches the existing designs very easily.In short I would say photoshop is very powerful and allows you to easily manipulate virtually anything however for simple straight forward designs you can go quite far with newer applications such as Sketch.In terms of cost look at Adobe CC Photography as its only . a month.,Frontend,d601kn1,1,t5_2sr2y

10833465,0,t3_5utzih,Ive had a lot of success by extracting out all ui elements into a separate npm module and creating a dummy appstyle guide from it. The key is to keep the dependencies on the dummy app very light. We used This approach on an ember project which was perfect because ember addons have the concept of a dummy app baked in. So you create a dummy app with just the minimum dependencies and require you uikit as an npm module. As a designer you then build out ui elements in the dummy app. The developers then import the uikit into your production app and plug in the elements youve designed. Youll need to do some pair programming to tweak everything at the end and get it production ready but for the most part you have a really simple development environment. I love this approach as a developer because it means that my production application only contains business logic. All of the complexity of the ui is neatly packed up in the uikit. Designers love this approach because they have an app with very few dependencies I.e. no database redis sidekiq etc... so they can rapidly prototype and experiment with different UI concepts. It is a significant upfront cost to architect your app like this but the end result is that anyone with a modicum of technical ability can git pull npm install then npm start the dummy app. Its a really nice solution to your problem of running a a complex app in dev. ,Frontend,ddxe95y,2,t5_2sr2y
10941558,0,t1_de8gene,gt There needs to be some communication on what software is being used. Sketch is exclusive to the Mac right now so unless you both get Macs that software needs to be dropped.Having the designer just change from a popular and stable software package to one that just entered beta seems like a bad idea to me.gt Dont be intimidated by Windows. I was opposite of you raised on Windows thrown into a Mac environment for my first real job! And after   hour work week I felt much better about the operating system.To be fair thats because going from Windows gt Mac in the development world is a much better experience than being forced to go back to Windows from Mac especially if the dev culture around the framework you plan to use is predominantly Macbased.Honestly OP not to sound too overly dramatic or pessimistic but this is really something that shouldve been ironed out before you took the job I realize that sounds incredibly privileged but its something to remember for next time. The differences between Windows and Mac dev community culture are massive. Ive worked in both. Going back to Windowsbased dev after spending time in OSX is not pleasant.,Frontend,de8jm5t,-4,t5_2sr2y

11092226,0,t1_depae12,They asked how Google or Amazon might rank developers. Amazon definitely has a lower standard and theyre up in Seattle. Though I do work in the Bay Area and am familiar with the expectations for big tech companies like Google. Just telling OP my experience like they asked up to them to consider it or not.

11548523,0,t1_dg4zjbg,Been using Bootstrap  for long time. Then a remote coder came up with Foundation and I hated it. After few struggling days I found it somehow better than Bootstrap. Someone may argue that the CSS is big after compiling but thats matter of settings. Basically to me Foundation is what Bootstrap V wants to be. Just my  cents.  ,Frontend,dg510ft,5,t5_2sr2y
