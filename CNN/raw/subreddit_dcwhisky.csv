3484650,0,t3_3036c4,I went. Notable deals include Talisker Distillers Edition   Highland Park Dark Origins  Glenfarclas   Colonel E.H. Taylor Straight Rye Not everything appeared to be at a discounted price and you cant use a credit card today or tomorrow while the sale is on. Some bottles that had Dollar Discount prices that were still higher than usual pricing at MoCo. I picked up three Talisker DEs two for friends of mine and an HP Dark Origins. If you havent been to Pine Orchard before its worth driving out. ,dcwhisky,cpph44q,2,t5_32lae

Ive heard of some people having issues with pressure changes loosening weak corks in flight so you could wrap up the top with some packaging tape to be extra safe but Ive never had problems with that myself.

So I figured Id wait until I had a pour of it before purchase which never happened. I only wanted to try it because its supposed to be Stagg. Well before long it had disappeared from all the shelves.

8347693,0,t1_d5l06ed,Seconded. Keep in mind the prices can vary wildly. Ive seen Oban  for like  and also  in the District. Try to aim for the lower end of that price range! You should be able to get a great gift for well under .If you want to go outside the old standbys a nice Clynelish might be an idea. The  is about  and available at a lot of liquor stores. If you were trying to go a little higher end Schneiders has some other options I mention Clynelish because theres some similarity between the two distillery profiles Oban and Clynelish in my head. Im sure others will disagree!,dcwhisky,d5l0jdk,3,t5_32lae
