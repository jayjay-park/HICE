2599435,0,t3_2plepo,RAW on Lollipop is an Android not a Sony thing.  What youre probably talking about breaking is some post processing being removed if you unlock the bootloader along with a bunch of other DRMrelated stuff.  I cant think of any technical reason why the two should be connected.  In fact its entirely possible that youd only get RAW mode if you used the Google camera app.  Perhaps not though it could be available for all apps to use. Either way Id be very surprised if Sony used this as a reason to now allow RAW mode.  ,SonyXperia,cmxvt1w,1,t5_2y3ed

2936534,0,t1_co1vfm6,Yeah I was confused too its totally different to how it works with a Nexus for example.A prerooted firmware contains the superuser binary file ie root. Thats easy to make but its not digitally signed by Sony so it cant be flashed through the stock recovery but it can be flashed by a custom recovery. The only way to get a custom recovery is with root. So we root on kitkat using this exploit and install a custom recovery. Then whenever Sony updates their rom we get that package and inject superuser and flash it with the custom recovery. People with new unrooted phones will have to downgrade to kitkat and install the custom recovery but after that we have root forever. The downside is we cant use the OTA update system.,SonyXperia,co1wa9k,3,t5_2y3ed

Those will probably never be updated thereby driving the statistic down.Anyway OEMs like Samsung LG and HTC have already released their Lollipop updates for most of their flagships months ago. The carrier situation is a far as Im concerned largely irrelevant. For me personally it is irrelevant because the phones updates in my countries thankfully arent tied to carriers. But it is also irrelevant to this discussion regardless as were talking at the speed that the OEMs release their update not the carriers. If a phone that has already received Lollipop in its unlocked edition but still didnt get the update on some carriers then really thats the carriers fault really.Anyway remember that we havent even got the initial update yet which will still have to take even longer for the appropriate carriers.,SonyXperia,cpa4g81,2,t5_2y3ed

Without that mode the camera is just bad and rarely gets the exposure and colors right.The ZC has this automatic mode called Superior Auto. Its really bad. It uses high ISO and does heavy postprocessing so you get images with lots of artifacts even under good light conditions.Now Ive fiddled with the manual mode and found a setup I like.Change focus mode to multi autofocus metering to multi and take pictures with the dedicated camera button press halfway til you see blue squares or hear a beep then all the way to take the pictures.This yields good photos and you can use the EV compensation when under low light conditions you can also increase the ISO but I really dont like getting it over .Once you get used to that the camera is good enough.

7087432,0,t3_4ce0l6,The screen on the zc doesnt bother me an ounce. It is only p but honestly doesnt bother me. Ive had my phone a few days and feeling kind of meh about it. I tried to keep expectations low and Im disappointed about the camera and concerned about the heat. I think my biggest issue is that the sony camera app is the only one that takes photos at mp. If you use a google camera app or something else mp only. I find the sony app to be very slow the physical camera button to be less than effective. It has horrible shutter lag but takes a decent photo.  I know people say it doesnt have an overheating problem but it is still scary to see your phone is  degrees F whilst browsing instagram or watching some snapchats. Im honestly concerned about it when summer time rolls around and if I bring it with me to the beach and it gets too hot. I have to be careful where I put it. I used to throw my moto g on my bed and not worry about it and now I have to watch where I put it. On the other hand the skin is pretty minimal nothing like the skin that was on my S.

7849881,0,t3_4mui4b,I had an Xperia Z a couple years ago but needed to replace as I needed a phone with more memory. I loved it so moving to a ZC seemed to be nobrainer to me. Here are my observations its laggy especially when I use Hangouts. Im trying to figure out why maybe because Ive never deleted chats and keep all chat history. But launching switching to and from Hangouts can be annoyingly slow. And the ZC was supposed to be snappy based on reviews. battery life is quite disappointing. The most OST Ive experienced is just over  hours but the total time was quite short. It has been hovering around  hours OST and Ill stretch out the total time to about  hours. the heat from the phone is brutal especially when Hangouts lags or I use the camera. This affects the battery and I can watch it drain  in a matter of  minutes. the lag on the camera is disappointing. Launching the camera from the button takes several seconds and snapping the shutter also takes a few seconds sometimes.

8188254,0,t3_414syn,Not exactly relevant to this test but I experience audio stuttering on xperia x but it seems to be connected to use rather than randomised. The stuttering almost always coincides with some sort of action either from my use or from background processes. For example right now while Im typing this the audio has a slight stuttering but not too bad. Earlier when the phone started updating a whole bunch of apps it became unlistenable.

8737886,0,t1_d6xcvnn,Im quite a noob in those kind of stuff but Ill definitely look into it and decide between that and L as uthedg suggested. Thank you both for your answers. Guess KitKat is out of question then? I also liked having the ability in MM to turn offdisable apps that cant be uninstalled like all those stock google music books etc. stuff so they dont slow the phone down and take space on the menu.

8746491,0,t3_4zkx6z,I started with Wajks Slim ROM .. upgraded to his Slimm .. but had lots of bugs and problems on Marshmallow.  I then decided to try downgrading to KitKat but realized that my app data wouldnt transfer over when I did try I had serious problems with lag and had to factory reset and I didnt want to reconfigure all my apps lose my progress in games etc.  So that was the end of KK.  I realized that the most stable ROM I had used was actually Lollipop despite the fact that I hated L when it was first released.  I thought it was a buggy memoryleaking styleoversubstance mess and I truly believe KitKat was the best version of Android weve seen to date.  But here I am back on L.I tried Concept M but disliked the lack of root and recovery since Im on a locked bootloader.  I use root for a ton of batterysaving tweaks as well as ad blocking.  But I think the biggest issue is that theres no real Stamina mode on Marshmallow and while you can get around that with some rootxposed tweaks that was impossible for me to do on Concept without unlocking my bootloader.  Which I didnt want to do because of the DRM issue with camera quality.I will say that I have NEVER been satisfied with the battery life on any of these.  Im not sure why I cant get decent battery life.  Everyone else gets up to  days on this phone.  Im on Stamina Mode  of the time and still barely make it to the end of a work day because Im plagued by a horrible Bluetooth wakelock that I cant get to the bottom of.  I use a Pebble Time so I cant just turn off BT.  This was the phone that was supposed to solve all my battery woes and yet its just as bad as my previous phones.,SonyXperia,d6yyrj7,2,t5_2y3ed

10744496,0,t1_ddo6444,Hong Kong and Taiwan doesnt even have the ..A.. update yet... Im not sure how that will play out if it can jump directly to the latest build. For Marshmallow HK actually got it before TW and RU before both but it was all in the same week. I have Taiwan version and if I recall for . it came about a week after Russia and others in the initial batch. There was some confusion as Sony Taiwan rolled it out on PC Companion first and advised everyone to use it but not everyone knew that. iT seemed afterwards the updates for TW were rolled out simultaneously on PC Companion and through OTA so it was usually a week or two after the initial update.Thailand didnt get the initial Nougat build. They got the ..A.. while the Nougat update was being put on hold. Singapore only got . in the days after the initial Nougat rollout.I too thought maybe theyre holding it back or this is only a provisional update but then again the update rolled out towards the middleend of the week and they dont seem to roll out updates often on weekends. I honestly dont expect too much for updates in terms of bugs or new features as Marshmallow wasnt all that new and had some bugs as well.

Stamina mode should give you two days of battery life easily and you can push three. If youre in the US why did you pick up the international version? You can flash the X Compact with an international firmware to get access to the fingerprint scanner super easy to do and allowed by warranty and you keep your US warranty which is nice.
