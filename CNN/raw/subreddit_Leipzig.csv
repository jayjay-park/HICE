7003670,0,t3_4bitf9,TravelGet to downtown Leipzig via the SBahn which has a stop at the airport. Once you get your baggage youll exit the baggage area go up the elevator that is to the left of the information desk and its a straight shot down a long large passageway to another elevator that takes you to the SBahn platform. Just follow the signs. And of course ask somebody if you arent sure. It should cost about  Euro. It is about  minutes to the Hauptbahnhof Main Station. Keep your ticket handy. They check tickets every time on the SBahn.Overnighting If you are OK with hostel living then stay at the Five Elements Hostel. Its  Euro   euro key deposit that you get back and is located downtown around the corner from the main square Markt across from the Altes Rathaus. Its about a  minute walk from Hauptbahnhof. The lockers arent very big there so if you have big luggage you may want to leave one of your suitcases in a locker at the Hauptbahnhof. They have free coffee and tea wifi a kitchen etc. The REWE City grocery store is very close so you can get food there if you dont want to eat at one of the restaurants. If you do want a restaurant then the Irish pub is easy and relatively cheap. They also have Leipziger Gse a sour beer that you need to have at least once. You may not want it more than once. o Another good option is the AampO hostel. It is very close to the Hauptbahnhof and looks clean. Ive never stayed there but it looks good. Im not sure what the locker situation there is.Tips Wander. Leipzig is a small enough place that you can wander through the main spots pretty easily. Zentrum the center is bounded on all sides by a major road the Ring so just wandering around Zentrum is a good way to start. Eventually youll want to hit up Karli a main stretch of bars and other things that runs south from Zentrum into Connewitz. Its a pretty hip area although if you are used to big cities it will seem very quiet to you. The third spot youll eventually get to is further west toward Plagwitz past ClaraZetkinPark. It is similar to Karli nice eateries and bars. It is the Brooklyn of Leipzig  they have a trendy hot dog restaurant for instance. But again it will seem very quiet if you are used to Berlin or New York.There is a really nice pavilion in ClaraZetkinPark that youll want to visit during the warm months. They have bands come and you can sit and eat your gelato bratwurst andor beer while listening and hanging out. Its a great way to spend a lazy afternoon.One other kinda weird place that you should check out is the Zeughaus Antiquten in far west Leipzig. You just ride the  all the way to its last stop in Plagwitz and its right down the street second walk. It has antiques from the DDR era and a bunch of other quasirandom things. They were starting to clean it out a bit when I was there which was a shame but there should still be a good bit to poke through.Beer. German beer has not kept up with North American beer when it comes to microbrews and craft beer. There are some good places but nothing like the ubiquity of North American beer. In my experience most Germans think American beer means Budweiser. So a good place to get really good beer is Bier Freunde. Its about a  minute walk from Markt. They have a great selection of German Belgian and even some American craft beer. That being said you have to have Urkrostitzer while youre there or Jever or Becks. It is everywhere.Speak German. I lived in Leipzig for a bit more than a year and loved it. The culture is friendly and easygoing. Youll have a great time. Youll have a bit more difficulty if you are going in without any language although if youll be spending all of your time with people under  the language barrier shouldnt be as much of a problem. However and you probably already know this insist on speaking German as much as possible. Leipzigers love to speak English if they know it so it can be tricky to get practice speaking German. The Uni has a conversation tandem website where you can sign up to meet with somebody to have a conversational exchange in your languages one hour English one hour German for instance. This was one of the best things I did when I was there. I made some good Leipzig friends this way and improved my German quite a bit.Eat Dont be afraid of the street food. Also kaffee and kuchen is the most marvelous tradition ever invented. Cake every day? Yes please! Speaking of which the Sdbrause in Connewitz has an amazing Apfelstrdel. Go check it out sometime but not a Sunday. The brunch line can be a bit much.Sorry  this response got a little out of hand. I loved Leipzig and hope to return somebody.
