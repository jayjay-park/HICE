5014242,0,t3_3jm6dd,Even more!gt Men and women have evolved to fulfill different roles in human communities. I think SJWFeminist attempts of late to erase  million years of biological software for a political agenda is very stupid and it wont work unless they work for the Umbrella corporation and can edit all our genes at once.Source gt Sorry but not sorry.Its scienceWe have a branch of psychology working on this. Gender is not a social construct. The only difference between boys and girls is not a pee pee. Our psychology and the way we think and see the world is fundamentally different and thats a good thing. A boy cant help but be interested in mechanical toys and moving parts. A girl cant help but be interested in faces dolls and human connection. Its not a coincidence that women pop out babies from their vagina protect it and take care of it while men dont. they prepare for it from birth while boys prepare for other things with their child plays and games. All animals do such cats learn to hunt mice learn to run and hide. Just because we advanced greatly int he last  years has no effect on how our software works how evolution coded our ROM. Girls will be interested in girly things because their DNA said so boys will be interested in boyish things. Eliminating gender tags from shelves is such a cheap PC move in order to look nice to the media and it will only confuse clueless men looking for gifts for birthday boysgirls. It will not change girls being interested in dolls or boys being interested action figures that transform into cars. If you want to deny science and  million years of evolution you might want to join a church and start preaching.Source Bonus SRS tantrum ,VOATinAction,cuqem37,4,t5_36hd8
5310014,0,t1_cvqd5yd,Ahh I missed out the last half of that sentence. Thats meant to be someone who thinks theyre fighting for social justice but is actually fighting to put some groups down instead of raising everyone up. What I mean is that people who are SJWs think theyre doing good but in reality theyre just persecuting someone else. The only difference is the ones they go after are privileged so using the same methods is somehow alright.,VOATinAction,cvqez89,1,t5_36hd8
