2508063,0,t3_2ocog2,The biggest players in ERP software by far are SAP and Oracle.  Im surprised your master didnt require a course in either of these but no matter..This is not fatal to your prospects but might be detrimental you can read some books the SAP press books will do fine or surf around as in most times wikipedia has a decent primer links sources and further readingThe real problem though is that ERP is so vast and differs so much from company to company that its not like learning excel.  For this reason most companies consider ERP knowledge a bonus and not a core requirement and do in house training.  Excel is the big one know it know it well know it deep.  I dont think people who dont work in business administration or with business administrators realize how utterly dominant excel is as a business tool.  Access or sql knowledge is also useful...  but it depends on what you want to do.  Logistics is a vast field.  ,logistics,cmlxx3a,1,t5_2qzgk

2610168,0,t3_2ppfak,I have offered advice before youre welcome to read my other posts. I never viewed logistics as a field I chose rather it chose me and my experience has been that this iswas the early career trajectory for many people colleagues that I work with. That could be changing as the field matures but I view it as an industry that will always be a little rough around the edges so that a more gentrified crowd is likely to steer clear. I dont know what sort of debt you have nor what your salary expectations are but you need to stay grounded an entry level plannerscheduler at a large company can expect to make K. Your starting number goes up to perhaps K if you have a more specialized MBA but I could not recommend spending several more years as a grad student in expectation of hitting that number. I earn K and hope to earn more with  years. I started as a nd shift shipping clerk  but recognized early on that I had to both find opportunities to improve the business and gut out some tough uncomfortable jobs in order to move up.  All of my job and company moves were calculated toward long term advancement rather than short term gain. I suppose Im saying without vast knowledge of other fields it is a field where industry knowledge rather than tenure and the right mix of conservativism and risk taking is financially rewarded. I went back to school for an MBA just a few years ago. Although you have an undergraduate degree I would suggest that after finding a job to pay off those loans locate a local college that offers some technical or graduate level classes in supply chain planning Try getting accepted as a part time graduate student. It helps to say that you are working on your MBA even if it isnt a fast track near term goal.  Then go find something. There are lots of PL companys that need line level employees. NOT as a warehouse workerinsist on finding a clerical supervisory or planning role. Saying that you can operate a forklift isnt going to be helpful.  Technology is dramatically changing the way work is being done. You want to be part of the automation trend and not a victim of it. I would consider targeting large distribution centers freight forwarders customs brokers and rd party logistics providers PLs. I think its also important to choose companies in growth industries and with better than average profitability and ROTC. This would tend to steer you toward public corporations. I would NOT recommend working for a full truckload carrier for that reason. I WOULD consider working for a railroad if Warren Buffet thinks its worth owning how bad can it be? But of all these my personal opinion and not because this is how I came up but because their success is so dependent upon excellent customer service  is that the PL route will give you the broadest preparation and exposure. Try to land a position as a customer service or planning representative where youll be at a desk with a computer and get experience in actual business processes. Then work on impressing the right people. And dont cut down your coworkers make them your partners. There is a great deal to learn youll find that you pick up the lingo as you go along if youre smart youll use formal education to continue to fill in the gaps as your career develops. Also anywhere your resume says logistics I would substitute Supply Chain. Fun fact  I was offered at least two positions because in the skills portion of my resume I put able to work long hours. ,logistics,cmzaboe,2,t5_2qzgk

10438638,0,t3_5pgp0y,Im going to take a stab at an answer anyone feel free to critique because I assure you Im no expert. First you would need to pick a market or specialty. WHAT are you going to deliver or haul? Are you going to do general mail and bulky packages? Or are you going to do something specific like Walker NAPA Auto parts and buy a warehouse to do fulfilment specifically for car parts. Granger industrial deliveries is another example of this. Next do you have any current competition? IS there anyone in the area that already fills that need? Are they doing well? whats their radius? Do their customers needs get truly fulfilled or are they lacking in some areas? If you find a market to fill and you dont have competition to set up shop with... Then you need a vehicle adequate to transport your load  a certain percentage. If you think your max delivery is going to be lbs you need to make sure your vehicle is rated for at least  more weight than would be required as to avoid damage to your vehicle and odd requests. Also of course if you have vehicles of a certain weight class you or whoever you hire as a driver has to have the appropriate operators license to drive that vehicle and you have to consider the appropriate taxes and tarrifs depending on how far you have to drive. You would also need a business license the appropriate insurance probably some level of securities clearance as an operator that is going to be facilitating deliveries of secured mail US postal workers have to obtain secrets clearance. Once all those details are worked out youll need customers. Someone who you can do these deliveries for. So are you going to haul multipoint for someone? Pick it up at their storage yard and deliver to a worksite? Or are you going to pick it up from a store and bring it to them? Or both even. Most customers are not going to want the same things as their neighbors are and while one guy will want you to do things  way the next guy is going to want something completely different. You have to make your offering clear so that the customer is fully aware of what services you provide how far youll go for what cost. Make sure you cover as much price wise as you can to avoid being taken over. Invest in a good contract design and invoice letter. Dont just type things up in emails and excel spreadsheets. Invest the time in a proper professional Invoice Letter or Invoice statement for your services that Clearly and Expertly expresses the costs and limitations of your said business. Ensure you are aware of any local regulations regarding the inception of a company of your kind and any special permissions you would need to operate under. Cities and Counties could have special tax laws regarding startup delivery companies or trucking vehicles should you become that large and its necessary to ensure you arnt breaking laws by being an active entrepreneur.These are some of the things I can think of off the top of my head. Im studying to be a logistics and transportation manager and these are alot of the things we talk about in class as far as delivery management and small privately owned trucking fleets.,logistics,dcral7f,5,t5_2qzgk
