7461564,0,t3_4hkhxm,Despite North Dakotas collapsing oil market its stateowned bank continues to report record profits. This article looks at what California with fifty times North Dakotas population could do following that states lead.In November  the Wall Street Journal reported that the Bank of North Dakota BND the nations only stateowned depository bank was more profitable even than J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. The author attributed this remarkable performance to the states oil boom but the boom has now become an oil bust yet the BNDs profits continue to climb. Its  Annual Report published on April th boasted its most profitable year ever.The BND has had record profits for the last  years each year outperforming the last. In  it reported . million in earnings total assets of . billion capital of  million and a return on investment of a whopping . percent. Its lending portfolio grew by  million a . percent increase with growth in all four of its areas of concentration agriculture business residential and student loans.By increasing its lending into a collapsing economy the BND has helped prop the economy up. In  it introduced new infrastructure programs to improve access to medical facilities remodel or construct new schools and build new road and water infrastructure. The Farm Financial Stability Loan was introduced to assist farmers affected by low commodity prices or belowaverage crop production. The BND also helped fund  new businesses.Those numbers are particularly impressive considering that North Dakota has a population of only about  just half the size of Phoenix or Philadelphia. Compare that to California the largest state by population which has more than fifty times as many people as North Dakota.What could California do with its own bank following North Dakotas lead? Here are some possibilities including costs risks and potential profits.Getting Started Forming a Bank Without Cost to the TaxpayersA bank can be started in California with an initial capitalization of about  million. But lets say the state wants to do something substantial and begins with a capitalization of  billion.Where to get this money? One option would be the states own pension funds which are always seeking good investments. Today state pension funds are looking for a return of about  per year although in practice they are getting less. One billion dollars could be raised more cheaply with a bond issue but tapping into the states own funds would avoid increasing state debt levels.At a  capital requirement  billion in capitalization is sufficient to back  billion in new loans assuming the bank has an equivalent sum in deposits to provide liquidity.Where to get the deposits? One possibility would be the California Pooled Money Investment Account PMIA which contained . billion earning a modest . as of the quarter ending March  . This huge pool of rainy day slush and investment funds is invested . in US Treasuries . in certificates of deposit and bank notes . in time deposits and . in loans along with some other smaller investments. A portion of this money could be transferred to the stateowned bank as its deposit base on which . could be paid in interest generating the same average return that the PMIA is getting now.For our hypothetical purposes lets say . billion is transferred from the PMIA and deposited in the stateowned bank. With a  reserve requirement . billion would need to be held as reserves. The other  billion could be lent or invested. What could be done with this  billion? Here are some possibilities.Slashing the Cost of InfrastructureOne option would be to fund critical infrastructure needs. Today California and other states deposit their revenues in Wall Street banks at minimal interest then finance infrastructure construction and repair by borrowing from the Wall Street bond market at much higher interest. A general rule for government bonds is that they double the cost of projects once interest is paid. California and other states could save these costs simply by being their own bankers and borrowing from themselves and with their own chartered banks they could do it while getting the same safeguards they are getting today with their Wall Street deposits and investments. The money might actually be safer in their own banks which would not be subject to the bailin provisions now imposed by the Gs Financial Stability Board on giant systemically risky banking institutions.To envision the possibilities lets say California decided to fund its new bullet train through its stateowned bank. In  Californians approved a bond issue of  billion as the initial outlay for this train which was to run from Los Angeles to San Francisco. At thenexisting interest rates estimates were that by the time the bonds were paid off California taxpayers would have paid an additional . billion in interest.So lets assume the  billion in available assets from the stateowned bank were used to repurchase these bonds. The state would have saved . billion less the cost of funds.It is not clear from the abovecited source what the length of the bond issue was but assume it was for  years making the interest rate about .. The cost of one billion dollars in capital for  years at  would be . billion and the cost of . billion in deposits at . would be . billion. So the total cost of funds would be . billion. Deducted from . billion that leaves about . billion in savings or profit over  years. Thats . billion generated with money the state already has sitting idle requiring no additional borrowing or taxpayer funds.What about risk? What if one of the cities or state agencies whose money is held in the investment pool wants to pull that money out? Since it is held in the bank as deposits it would be immediately liquid and available as all deposits are. And if the bank then lacked sufficient liquidity to back its assets in this case the repurchase of its own bonds it could in the short term do as all banks do  borrow from other banks at the Fed funds rate of about . or from the Federal Reserve Discount Window at about .. Better yet it could simply liquidate some of the  billion remaining in the PMIA and deposit that money into its state bank where the funds would continue to earn . interest as they are doing now.Assume that from its . billion in profits the bank then repaid the pension funds their  billion initial capital investment. That would leave . billion in profit free and clear  a tidy sum potentially generated by one man sitting in an office shuffling computer entries without new buildings tellers loan officers or other overhead. That capital base would be sufficient to capitalize about  billion in new loans all generated without cost to the taxpayers.A California New DealThe bullet train example is a simple way to illustrate the potential of a stateowned bank but there are many other possibilities for using its available assets. As the BND did after building up its capital base the bank could advance loans at reasonable rates for local businesses homeowners students school districts and municipalities seeking funds for infrastructure.These loans would be somewhat riskier than buying back the states own bonds and they would involve variable time frames. Like all banks the state bank could run into liquidity problems from borrowing short to lend long should the depositors unexpectedly come for their money. But again that problem could be fixed simply by liquidating some portion of the money remaining in the PMIA and depositing it in the stateowned bank where it would earn the same . interest it is earning now.Here is another intriguing possibility for avoiding liquidity problems. The bank could serve simply as intermediator generating loans which would then be sold to investors. That is what banks do today when they securitize mortgages and sell them off. Risk of loss is imposed on the investors who also get the payment stream but the bank profits as well by receiving fees for its intermediating functions.The federallyowned Reconstruction Finance Corporation RFC did something similar when it funded a major portion of the New Deal and World War II by selling bonds...More ,bnd,d2qc0rb,1,t5_34cyu
