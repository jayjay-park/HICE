298993,0,t1_cfauqlh,Thank you for your reply. I guess Sit in the mix was a poor choice of words on my part but there has to be a way to make the vocal sound more intune with the instrumental. It doesnt have to sound like a hit pop record. WuTangs  Chambers is a hit record and hiphop classic and was recorded on an extremely limited budget in . I just want to make it so the vocals arent blatantly sitting well above the beat.In rap music it is extremely common for rappers to cherry pick beats from other rappers albums to make a mixtape. Im sure famous artists like Lil Wayne have access to anybodys high quality instrumental they want but most rappers dont and they record over shitty twotrack Mps. They never sound great but they sound decent. Much better than mine. Isnt there somewhere I can cut boost compress or filter to help match the tonal quality?The mic was recommended to me by a friend. Hes an audio engineer. Normally I would just ask him these questions but he is a very busy dude. He recommended it based on my broke mans budget and because he believed it would add warmth to my vocals which are usually pretty monotone like Earl in the Hive video I posted or MF DOOM. I thought ribbons were mostly used for vocal mics for lounge singers and things like that. Can you explain why being midrangey and lacking high end is bad for a rapper? My room is mildly treated. I have open cell foam on two walls and the ceiling and a book shelf placed close by because I was told it would help with diffusion. Next pay day I plan to buy supplies to make a bass trap.

Its unlikely youll get the latency low enough to really feel natural and if you decrease your hardware buffer size you will limit your ability to use processing especially if you are recording more than one track at a time.

371598,0,t1_cfj90kw,I remember a professional engineer showing me what mp compression actually does and the effects seemed so subtle it kind of left this impression on me that sound engineers have absolutely phenomenal hearing to be able to pick that up. The way you put it seems more realistic that were kind of used to it nowadays. Kind of interesting to think that it isnt only music theory that is cultural but music quality too. What you are saying about those blurred lines is kind of tricky though. The owner of Toe Rag studios in London says something similar. To paraphrase he says that if you are recording something you are a producer. Period. The choices you make will fundamentally alter the sound. That being said I remember in a thread here that to work in the industry you should never label yourself as a producer because it just sounds snobbish etc. Im not looking to go into pro sound I have my own thing going and I like it for what it is and maybe I could call myself a producer.,audioengineering,cfja55s,1,t5_2qkby

Sounds like the other guy is using thinner heads.Here is another plainasdirt but capable drummer.  The Blue Note is a small room about the size of a cafe hence no overheads. Your toms sound more like Anton Fig in this video but it is not the right thing for the track you recorded.

It is a style thing. Someone else might have a tighter snare and more openresonant toms. And it is all in how you hit them just like the guitar sound is from the hands of the guitar player despite all that amp stuff.

599389,0,t1_cg8e7ja,Well first of all this is one of my first mixes so it wont sound pro pro but itll give you an idea. Bare in mind I also used a stereo system for monitors which is the worst idea possible.  The distorted guitars bass  and a few effects are plugged in from Guitar Rig.   Depending what you do and how many effects you implement it wont take too much juice. I have a bottom end computer and with the right settings between my DAW and computer it works pretty flawlessly. The real time playing will depend on your soundcard Ive got a tricapture interface and its pretty responsive with Guitar Rig. I can get that huge stadium Marshall stack feel and pretend Im a rock star in real time. When recording you will here your guitar play back through your monitors or headphones as it will sound when you play back the track so with all the settings and effects in real time. To answer your last question you can always change your effects tones amp sim settings later to your tastes so long as you dont burn the track render it in your DAW and delete your original track which youve used with Guitar Rig to record.  ,audioengineering,cg8ejyq,3,t5_2qkby

I want to normalize it so that the stereo image is more similar to what an actual person would hear which would be near equal loudness in each ear.

639674,0,t3_21h3gl,Definitely flatten and start again. A PA should never have insane boosts like this... If you need to boost so much at the EQ stage there is a problem somewhere else. As a last resort you could bring up the master on the EQ if you cant get what you need out of the system elsewhere AND assuming this wont start clipping the amps. After this then you cut where needed. Although to be boosting in the mids like this is just bizzare. When tuning a PA you should only ever really have to cut. Occasionally boost a few dB in the  range if the sub is struggling or even very small amounts in the kk region for a little extra clarity. To be honest if those boosts were all cuts instead it would make a lot more sense just looking at it and not knowing the room at all. This just screams amateur operator. Abort and doover.

686143,0,t3_220kp6,Lots of people have already said a lot of key points. This sounds mostly like a tuning issue or your drummer is hitting off center. With close mics that sound like that Ill either replace or if there is a ton of articulation I will use a transient designer to add crack which can minimize the ringyness. Ill just post up my list Good snare with fresh heads tuned. I like tight top loose bottom. Some like even tuning. keep a spare head on in case it starts to die. Check how its mounted to the stand this can affect sound as well. Make sure its in phase with the overheads. Its ok to spend a whole ton of time on this step. Make sure the snare stays in one spot and the hardware is setup so that it wont move. Make sure its being hit consistently in the center check out where the drummers stick marks are hitting. Top  Bottom micing pull the sustain from the bottom and crackattack from the top. check there phase as well flip the bottom Whats the room like? In a small room with parallel walls you might get some phasey sounding issues try to deaden on the ceiling above and floor below. if this takes too much liveliness out you can split the difference. An old trick is to put a sheet of plywood on the floor under the snare. You might also have picked a resonant spot in the room to place the snare drum. You might be surprised at the quantity of records that use snare triggers as blends. in this case you could use one for crack and one to fill out the bottom. ,audioengineering,cgi9kx1,2,t5_2qkby

I usually find myself close micing only when I absolutely have to full band is tracking at once or not enough space in the room to get much distance from the cab etc. As far as micing things theres rarely an occasion where you always mic something one way or the other.

They may have the same core function  to repeat  but various types of delay perform that function differently and the resulting sound will vary accordingly. You could argue that the echoed sound is being altered by the inputoutput stage or even by the method of replication itself i.e. Tape vs IC and that this is independent from the core purpose of the device which is purely replication but that seems kind of ridiculous. Effects in general are the sumtotal of their components and processes and the character they impart will effect the resulting sound.

1441551,0,t3_2ann4a,Heres my best advice  Ostinatos. Layered rhythms if you will. Pick an array of percussion instruments  bass drums mallet and kick toms kit taiko etc  snares and finally things like hi hat tambourine wood blocks  as you can see the focus in frequencies on the instruments goes from lower to higher and the length of the actual sounds produced go from longer to shorter.Try using the kicks only on best  of every bar. Try using the toms on beats  and . Now snares on all  beats in the bar with different degrees of velocity. Add a th note slap back echo for some color.As for the the other hand percussion instruments alternate using th an th notes again with varying degrees of velocity. But make sure they all hit hard on beat  for impact.,audioengineering,ciwz3gs,1,t5_2qkby

I use Waves C or C but any Multiband compressor should also be able to expand.  Expansion does the opposite of compression when reaching a threshold the levels increase instead of decrease creating a wider dynamic range instead of a smaller one.  Using multiband allows for different frequency ranges to respond independently creating an illusion of a more variable dynamic range.  Of course nothing beats being able to go back and fix the mix but when working with just a master it can help.,audioengineering,cj0deo4,1,t5_2qkby

1513587,0,t1_cj5mq5j,When Im replacing patches I tend to just reach for either Native Instruments Massive FM or uhes Zebra. The reason boils down to knowing them very well and being able to quickly dial in a sound. There are countless other synths I could be using just as effectively but these work for me because Im generally familiar with how the patches are programmed. Whether they are better really boils down to the individual programming them.Unlike the synths I mentioned Nexus is a very limited sampler so they are different beasts. If youre looking for an actual sampler comparable to Nexus Id suggest Native Instruments Kontakt. Its cheaper has access to a larger library of samples and has a ton of modulation options. Native Instruments sell a bundle called Komplete which has all their synths including Massive FM and Kontakt plus a huge library full of useful sounds. Komplete is probably the best bang for your buck in the VSTAU instrument world so consider looking into that.Native Instruments currently has Komplete  for on sale so check it out before settling on Nexus. I hate being a fanboy for Native Instruments but their products are all very high quality and insanely cheap when you purchase them bundled in Komplete.Komplete Ultimate  go for this one if you canKomplete Standard  great value if Ultimate is out of your price rangeHope that helps. ,audioengineering,cj606ko,3,t5_2qkby

1760906,0,t1_ck0vylz,Yeah thats how most engineers started off myself included.  Generally its better to cut than boost and this gets easier over time as you train your ears and learn good tricks like the one in that video.  I almost never boost anymore.Boosting adds noise and you end up with a mix where the instruments are fighting each other for the same frequency ranges and it sounds a bit artificial.  Boosting also makes it harder to get your mixes to translate to other systems.  For example boosting the highs might sound okay on your sound system but you take it to another system that already has exaggerated highs and your boosted highs now sound piercing and the mix is swimming in a sea of harsh treble.  Same deal for boosting lows.  It helped me a lot to get into the mindset of what frequencies dont I need for this instrument?  Generally you dont need a lot of lows on guitars theyll just mask the bass you dont need low thump on a snare drum you dont need the high frequencies on a bass and so on.  This approach makes each instrument more intelligible and the pieces tend to fall into place without needing to boost.  tip when you cut on a particular instrument you often want to use a little makeup gain in the EQ to get it back to the same overall level.  That way you can AB the uneffected sound with the cut sound at the same volume level to see which sounds better other things being equal the louder track will generally sound better so you dont want this quirk of human hearing to bias your choice between the EQed and nonEQed version.  ,audioengineering,ck14av9,2,t5_2qkby

MFSL did some wacky stuff but they were obsessed with refusing to change the studios sound and Ive never found their records lacking bass.When it comes to IGD wellmaintained records and playback equipment will handle loud tracks just fine so its not the end of the world if you want to finish off a side with a loud song.

Other DAWs have been making leaps and can do everything pro tools can do better easier faster and cheaper as well as better marketing towards the newer demographic. The only reason why PT is industry standard is because it WAS the first and best during the strong push for better recording software  i wanna say  ish. Avid is in still in fighting shape even after it was urged near bankruptcy a few times. Its never been DAW vs DAW it has been newer DAWs vs Industry standard Pro tools.

2232031,0,t3_2kgza8,For modern metalrock  clarity is your goal for guitars. You want good attack but not too much fizz. The heavy will come from the drums and bass. Check out some rock band guitar stems for an idea. There are a lot of variables and its super easy to trick your ears when working with guitar tones. For  through Mesa oversized cab with vs its typically similar to preamp  .  bass   mid   treb   res pres and post to taste. The ii and  are voiced different from the . Playing style strings tuning pickups scale length  tubes etc all play a part so its not always straightforward. Check your cab for the speaker that sounds best to you. As far as volume it may not actually have to be super loud to get where you need it to be modern sounds rely much more on preamp gain than the sound of a clean amp cranked up distort the power section. Tubescreamers will indeed help kill some of the flub and generally tighten up guitar tracks keeping them focused in the midrange area they generally belong in. Typical trouble areas on guitar tracks are around .k and k areas for fizz.

But some of my favorite recordings ever have been done with a C and an MA so a tube mic and a condenser. Both capture pretty different nuances and make a nice when used as a spaced pair.

2434645,0,t3_2ndiu8,I prefer doing any performance correction by hand and ear rather than automatically quantizing  before I had audio stretching Id cut the beat up move whatever i needed to to make it sound better and do crossfades. Now I do basically the same thing but I dont need to crossfade any more. I never do automatic quantization.I do very much see that as a last resort though  Ill usually record mutiple takes until I think Ive got between the takes the whole song performed to the best of the players ability. Ideally its one brilliant take more often its one take thats better so you use that as the basis but then you fly in a better intro fill from take  the last verse from take  etc to comp together the master take.If the player cant perform the whole song in one run through after say two or three takes then do it section by section. Build up to the hard bit but dont make it the last thing you do or it turns into the impossible end boss.Then Ill comp takes. The aim is to produce something that sounds believable as one complete take. Sometimes the player will do different parts from take to take in that case youve just got to choose the ones you think are best for the song. Sometimes the tone will change between takes as mics were knocked vocal chords warmed up etc. You just have to be vigilant for that sort of thing during the recording and deal with it best you can after.If comping still leaves me with performance issues then its time to get editing but I like to live with the track for a bit as sometimes loose can be good and its important not to rob the performance of its humanity and emotional impact in a misguided attempt to make it sound perfect.As to instrument specific stuff yes it makes a difference. If its drums I like to make the drummer do more complete performances as I find each performance has a flow of energy thats hard to replicate by getting the drummer to start from cold after the second verse or whatever. Ill only do section by section if were really having to dissect the parts in minor detail and the drummers having trouble remember it all. If theyre struggling on one particular part focusing on it in isolation has never been fruitful so I prefer to run takes in the hopes theyll accidentally forget to play it badly in the heat of performance.If its a guitarist it depends on style but section by section is much more common. And if its a vocalist Ill usually do three full takes then start doing difficult problem sections and just try to be sensitive to when the vocalist is getting tired.,audioengineering,cmcmmfr,17,t5_2qkby
2437478,0,t1_cmcwvth,Thanks for the reply!What I want is to run all of my signals through the mixer then send them to my computer. It has been unclear to me as to how phantom power interacts with a non condencer mic dynamicribbon I have been told by my professors to basicly steer clear of sending phantom power to a ribbon mic and that its better to not send phantom power to a dynamic mic. If I can turn on phantom power when I have a dynamic mic plugged in then I guess I have no problem. I just wanted to have phantom power for condenser mics while also having a dynamic or ribbon mic plugged in. All I want to do is send signals to the mixer first then send each channel to an input on my computer. So from what you have said phantom power can not be sent back through the direct outs of my mixer which is what I assumed.You say that I shouldnt send the direct out to the Pre amps on my tascam because they are designed for line levle inputs...so how should I send each channel of the mixer to my interface? Im fairly new to this stuff and there are some things that I need cleared up.The Mackie vlz pro only has an option to turn phantom power on or off for all channels at the same time but the tascam can send phantom power in groups of four,audioengineering,cmcz7s8,1,t5_2qkby

2550100,0,t3_2owiwb,It doesnt sound like EQ or compression is the problem. I dont know how much youve messed around with placement but assuming youve picked the best mics you have available for the job move your mics around before you EQ or compress anything.If youre a beginner take it one step at a time. It might help you to strip down your mic setup. Start out with a single OH mic. If your drummer is cymbal heavy try putting your OH behind the drummer above his head pointed at the snare a method I lovingly call doggystyle. Try differnt distances angles and heights.  Then move on to maybe XY or spaced pair then start adding close mics like your kick and toms. Each mic you add should make the kit sound better than before. If it doesnt check your phase move your mics or dont use it. Youll learn a lot this way if youre astute. Remember when youre tracking into a DAW that unless youre using outboard gear you can always EQ and compress after. Therefore get the best goddamn sound you can going to disk without any help from your plugins. Sometimes it helps to do some compression before but Id save that for when youve gained a little more experience and know more or less what sound youre going for.If you have a way to sum to mono do all of this in mono before you start panning and creating a stereo image. Phase and EQ issues will be a lot more noticeable. ,audioengineering,cmrfou7,1,t5_2qkby
2554496,0,t1_cmqy2zy,For substantial audio repair like this I usually end up having three plugins on the track an EQ a compressor and another EQ in that order. On the first EQ hi pass as much as you can without it being detrimental then cut on the regions that are most harsh usually k on phone mics to try to smooth out the sound a little. Apply normal vocal compression and then use the second EQ in broader strokes to massage the good stuff up and the bad stuff out. The EQ before the compressor will help prevent the nastiness from being brought up and the second EQ will be smoother and help correct the overall tambre. If you end up with a thin sound from this which is likely a nice transformer saturation or tape emulation plugin can warm it up again. The overall results usually are lofi in nature but often very usuable.,audioengineering,cms0d12,2,t5_2qkby

At the start of the ram were going to put some space that the computer can put audio in and well play out of the outputs. In the middle well have all the soundfonts and at the end maybe some random junk?So normally the soundcard just plays from the start of the ram. When it gets to the end its supposed to just loop back to the start. But somehow dodgy code who knows? once in a while it gets it wrong and doesnt loop back.

I was able to fix my problem by switching the USB port or moving the other connected USB devices to another port. Im using a desktop system though so there is a difference there as my system has three different USB busses and I was able to move everything else to a different bus.Troubleshooting ideas Try a new cable  shouldnt be too hard to find someone who has a cable to try.  Switch USB ports on your laptop  if this is an option. Try the microphone on another computer and see if it has the same problems  best bet would be a desktop and maybe another laptop that is different than yours. Try using an external USB hub that has its own power source  this would provide a clean power source and might stop the buzzing. As the Blue Yeti only has a USB output you wont be able to connect it to your computer through an interface. For this you would need the Yeti Pro  which has both XLR and USB output.And lastly as for the people who will tell you to just drop the Yeti  that is an option if you have money to spend and are willing to. Otherwise you can make good quality music with the Yeti  as seen from the many videos on Youtube. Hope that helped a little ,audioengineering,coczcs9,3,t5_2qkby

What it can do though is reduce transients so when they hit they seem quieter as compared to the material AFTER or BEFORE it.

Fill a gallon bucket with it and use a pressure washer to wash your things make sure the water enters through the ventilation openings as you want to wash the circuit boards inside. If you dont have access to demineralized water you can use tap water. The real danger is the soap and other caustic products nonneutral acidity products as theyll do way more damage than simply water and theyll continue corroding your gear even after being dry so the hurry is about removing them. Of course cabinets guitars and any other parts made of wood will suffer if exposed to water even more if theyre made of MDFMDP so the less time the better but the metallicplastic gear that tends to have more electronic pieces can withstand water for way more time.After washing them with the pressure washer you may want to remove the water the fastest way possible. Dry the gear in the open under the sun use towels to remove the excess and at night put them in a closed room with air conditioning if possible and a small bucket with about kg of cooking salt NaCl. The air conditioning and the bucket of salt remove the rooms umidity and greatly accelerate the drying process. After three days drying under the sun and three nights drying in the room with the air conditioning and the bucket of salt your gear hopefuly will be fine and you can plug them turn them on and enjoy.If the bucket with salt starts to fill with water by itself expected then remove the excess water if at night and put the bucket with salt to dry up during the daylight.,audioengineering,coyot13,1,t5_2qkby

Group the drums tracks including overheadscymbals as you know if you just do the snare the rest will be off  Select the one bar the offending snare hit is in. So for example if its in bar  click on Bar  beat one and press B ensure Keyboard focus is on which is the little button with the A Z in the top right corner of the edit window to Break clip which will make a line and a new clip. Then click on bar  beat  and press B. If you are in Grid mode and have grouped the drum tracks now all drum tracks should have that one bar separate. Now highlight that bar by just clicking on it. They should all highlight. Open Beat Detective. In the Selection area middle section that bar should be the selected area.     to     If not just manually type that in. Over on the left click on BarBeat Marker Generation. On the right select Sub Beats and put the sensitivity anywhere and click Analyze. You should see little purple lines on the Transients. Slide the sensitivity down until pretty much just the snare hits are making the purple lines you dont want too many beats detected.  Ignore Groove Template Extraction for this exercise.  Go back to the left and click Clip Separation then down the bottom click Separate. That will make little clips between hits. On the left again click Clip Conform You shouldnt have to change any other settings. This will conform the transients to the grid but there will be noticeable gaps. So then click on Edit Smoothing on the left. On the right choose Fill Gaps and Crossfade and set the crossfade time ms will do the track. Down the bottom Click Smooth.Now you should have tightness!

Can you please send me the MP file rather than uploading it to Soundcloud? I have a feeling its being bounced in a very low bitrate despite Mixcraft telling you its highest quality. As for the programs it shouldnt matter what you use as long as you can export in an uncompressed format. Use what feels most comfortable.If you do want to try something else then I can tell you that while Ableton is an amazing piece of software its mostly for Electronic Music production.Sampletank is a massive VST sample library with tons of very natural sounding instruments.

3546552,0,t1_cpwgt9e,Instead of having to put gain plugins around your project you can just adhere to common good practice instead and avoid clipping issues all together. What youre suggesting is just a form of reactive gain staging to make up for being lazy while recording.Gain staging is certainly not irrelevant just because we work in the digital domain as I provided examples to visualize. Yes you can insert gain plugins to adjust gain on tracks that have improper recorded levels and reactively play around with bus faders but by adhering to good engineering practice to begin with it becomes much easier to avoid clipping buses and plugins without having to do that extra work. Whether or not clipping any particular plugin sounds good is besides the point it should be a conscious decision by the engineer not a byproduct of bad engineering. Keep it simple is just as valuable in sound engineering as everywhere else.By going for a common nominal level dBFS being a standard while recording you can forget about having to put up gain plugins on your tracks to make up for being lazy in the tracking stage.

3803758,0,t3_33zdnw,s are solid but Id prefer a SMb though it is a steeper price point than the s. Personally I might go with an audio interface such as the Focusrite Scarlett i or a used  or a bunch of other options  and here is why. First of all it depends on what youre doing and how much you are going to edit your stuff. The advantage of the board is it has an on board mixer... well if youre recording in a set area on a computer you will have your eqs and plugins on the computer and you really dont have a use for the nobs. Secondly unless I read this wrong I read it quickly the Allen and Heath is going to give you a stereo recording in your DAW which means no edits on individual tracks and audio interface that not an issue because youre recording in the box. Latency is a worry so it depends on your computer and how hard you can run it though pod casting kind of is low on the totem poll of horse power. In short it just depends on how much work you do post production and if you want to use plugins like Waves DeBreather and if you want to make small edits. Though to make you feel at ease I dont think there is anything wrong with the way youre going about this it will sound just fine. The nice thing though about setting your tracks the way you want them in the box is you can create a template and every track will be the way you set it and you dont have to worry about dont touch the knobs or writing all that stuff down. Plus then you can actually change where people sit and just make sure there microphone is going into there track template by changing the input on the computer. I said Focusrite because I like there pres until you get into the neve  range or the BLA which I like a lot and is a hell of a lot cheaper.,audioengineering,cqpuxjd,4,t5_2qkby

A PCM sampling rate of .kHz CD quality covers this completely and utterly with a little headroom for filtering.Humans CAN hear the difference between  bit and  bit PCM technically. But Id challenge you to find a mastered record that truly utilises that. Other than a smooth fade out at the end.Higher sample rates only really make sense for audio manipulation and sound design. If you want to cut the playback speed in half youre also cutting the sample rate in half and therefore the frequency response.bit is most useful for recording to maximise dynamic headroom before clipping at the AD stage.When the redbook standard was invented it was invented for a reason.

3951186,0,t3_35pfvp,A couple days ago I told someone on here how to use the invert feature on certain gates as a form of upward compression. here is a link to that thread.    I got a pm mentionimg how it sucks that not all gates have the invert feature and this got me thinking. Here is a technique to invert any gate.    Duplicate your track. Invert the phase on the duplicated track pretty much all DAWs have this feature. Now when you play them you should only hear silence. Set up any gate on your duplicated track only. Play with the threshold and viola! Inverted gate.    It works because when the gate is working the inverted phase track is silent so your original is audible. When the gate is off the inverted phase track plays and cancels the original leaving you with silence. ,audioengineering,cr6o3j2,10,t5_2qkby
3963052,0,t1_cr7yugg,I sometimes get the feeling that metal engineers live in a different world from engineers of more common or popular genres. Not as a bad thing or any kind of badge of honour or anything but I think the audiences artists production methods concepts expectations etc. are all kind of foreign to people who arent familiar with the genre. Honestly I seriously considered that just posting the original question was going to be a crapshoot and either misunderstood and downvoted to oblivion by people who think that modern metal is just a bunch of guys who go into a room and record a metal record by playing the songs the whole way through or Id catch a few guys who knew what I was talking about and get some meaty responses. Thankfully its kind of gone the latter way.

4076914,0,t1_crkraic,Yeah its pretty common for me to stitch together a soundwordline from alternate takes to fix issues but I guess I still see it as more copypaste a complete sound than painting a missing component of a larger sound. Its like if had two photos of a persons face and one was smiling and frowning. I like everything about the frowning picture except the frown itself. I can cut just the mouth of the smiling photo out and blend it with the frown. However going back to my off axis shotgun example.. I know its sound thinhollow and is missing some frequencies that the mic didnt pickup. However I cant paint just those back in I have to cut out the entire soundwordphrase from an alternate take and use that. I see that as more I decide to use the entire smiling photo over the frowning one not that I was able to elements out of one and use them in another if that makes sense.I would argue you can take a snapshot of sound simply because it can be represented as a D image waveform or spectrogram and Im sure others exist and converted back and forth with  degradation. I can even identify quite a few blemishes like ground loop birds chirping phone ringing just by eye. Im not skilled enough to make out anything complex like words but I bet a trained individual could.I am however curious if a skilled individual can literally modify a spectrogram in photoshop type program to paint in the missing frequencies when the shotgun mic off axis and only gets a partial recording.I feel some of that could potentially be automated as well. Say I have a recording of a wordphrase with an off axis shotgun and its missing hzkhz of the signal. Say its the phrase rubber baby buggy bumpers and then I have the actor delivery the line again in a better environment and extract only the missing portions and blend them. Or even just select the individual phonemes from other recordings to rebuild it.,audioengineering,crkzszf,1,t5_2qkby

The mattress will absorb much of the balls inertia and it will fall to the floor. This is dumbed down but a similar thing is happening with the sound in the room. A large pillow will work. A sheet will not as it is not rigid nor does it have much mass.Word of the wise if you do use a spring mattress be wary of resonances within the mattress.EDIT Using a spring mattress as diffusion or as a baffle is usually fine Ive done it plenty. I was warning more against the advice of putting the mic right up against it and singing into the mattress. Using a large pillow or futon pad like uemcnelis suggested would be an excellent substitute for this application.EDIT  I want to add that recording vocals in a lively room is not always bad and can in fact create the right setting for the music especially if they are recorded in the same room that the band tracked in.,audioengineering,crm3fa3,7,t5_2qkby

4187021,0,t3_38s7d3,Very good explanation by the fluxxone in the comments but heres your ELIunbalanced cables  only able to carry unbalanced signals. will pick up alot of noise over distances longer than m. You cannot run power cables beside them or there will be too much interference. eg. TSRCA cablesbalanced cables  able to carry both unbalanced and balanced signals by using a third wire inside the cable and super magic hax it can carry signals for way longer distances and power interference is not an issue. eg. TRS XLR cablesYes go look up the difference in TS and TRSHowever these balanced cables just give you the ability to CARRY balanced signals. If your audio source is not a balanced output the signal will not be balanced. So a DI unit is used to convert unbalanced signals to balanced signals. eg unbalanced out from guitar jack  use a DI.   balanced out from professional mics  dont need to use a DI.    unbalanced out from consumer mics  depends how far are you going. Most mixer inputs are built to translate the magic hax that goes on in balanced signals. If the mixer does not support balanced signals sending in a balanced signal will not work. Most audio interface and mixers inputs and outputs are balanced but I cannot guarantee it do check the manual or specs before you buyuse a mixer. But  of the time it should support balanced signals.,audioengineering,crxisnx,3,t5_2qkby

4225940,0,t3_38x9h0,Here is the differencesissues vs upright an on its side. Typical monitor is gonna be split into two cones tweater and woofer tweater on top woofer on bottom. No by laying them on the side making sure the tweaters are furthest apart from each other this is what you get. A bigger stereo field. It makes your stereo image wider and you can place things better. The only other positive is if you need to see past your speakers to the band or something like that It will be easier but thats about it for positives.The downside. It is not designed to be lain on its side. So manufacturers have probably not tested any anomalies that may occur with the monitor on its side could work perfectly fine could cause an issue no real way of knowing without testing. Secondly now remember what I said about the wider stereo field this is the part you wont like. No to get that stereo field you have to meticulously place those speakers to take advantage of it. Now the part that really sucks you have to be at exact phantom center at all times to properly listen to what is being outputted on the monitors. By moving left to right you will run into weird phasing issues in the mid and high frequencies. Runing the tonal quality and stereo image.The similar effect happens when the speaker is upright that would involve moving your head up and down a lot. And still it is not as severe as the side to side issue with laying speakers. So basically its not worth laying your monitor on its side. ,audioengineering,cs1xneo,1,t5_2qkby

So depending on how loud you were listening before and how much you turned it down it could be an entirely different issue. Its not that the vocals are still mixed too loud but that you simply lose everything else in the mix but the vocals guitars etc. Try listening and comparing how the vocals sound compared to everything else.

4433513,0,t1_cspghqu,Thats actually true There are no vendorsupplied ASIO drivers for that interface and youre meant to use that newer audio driver architecture they came up with to replace WDM but I couldnt get that driver to perform  well. Eventually switching to ASIOALL solved that but even that took some time to get working well but nothing out of the ordinary. Beyond that there was the issue of Waves running out of video memory I assume and rendering all of their plugins as white boxes. So I dropped in an R X.Well AMD failed to sign their drivers properly so I had to learn how to boot Win in test mode every time so that I could use unsigned drivers for a few months before AMD issued an update. It also took a while for me to figure out a way to get MS to accept my serial. If youre familiar with Win s registration nag you are well aware of the subtle genius it employs to annoy you into submission. I ended up having to call them and having it validated over the phone. Further still were issues like if you have the ASIO driver open its obviously taken direct control of the sound card and locks everything else out of using it which is fine if thats all the machine does but Im likely to keep my DAW open for days at a time just minimized and waiting. With ASIO locking the card FF and Chrome tend to freeze if attempting to open a page that needs to access the sound card like YouTube. Its just an annoying way to work if you know about the existence of CoreAudio. It seemed MSs new driver arch was meant to help solve a lot of these types of problems but I couldnt get the latency low enough on my rig. Also just general points of contention like if you use small icons in the taskbar the Start orb hangs over the bottom edge of maximized windows sometimes blocking important controls. Just...why?I hadnt used Windows in about  years so every problem like this required a lot of digging around to solve and the whole experience made me in short happy to format that drive to EXT in the end. ,audioengineering,cspj60n,1,t5_2qkby

4514733,0,t1_csz8w4e,You do realize they go hand in hand though right? To set the proper input level you often have to adjust the gain or trim of the signal coming into your recording device. There is a sweet spot in the gain structure where you want you signal to be. Too low and youll have to bring the signal way up later to be able to hear it. Too high and you risk clipping plus youll pick up more ambient noise. Somewhere in the middle is where you want to be. If youre using a dynamic mic you wont be able to pick up the nuances of a piano due to their lack of sensitivity and boosting the input level wont get you to where you want to be before clipping. Using a condenser mic or two will pick up the full range of the piano while recording at a nominal level. ,audioengineering,cszq7hv,1,t5_2qkby
4514915,0,t1_cszlik7,Definitely this. You can get back quite a lot after a good while of rest. Wear some flat response ear plugs as often as you can and definitely before being exposed to noise. Your ears will clear pop suddenly after enough rest by stages. A gentle Vasalva maneuver or swallowing and sniffling forcefully can help speed up a clearing when it is ready dont insist on it.  Do get tested after you get to the baseline. Can take sometimes up to a month to get back some of the finer highs in my experience. Protect yourself even more after recovery.Sinus congestion can be a factor too. Avoid Tylenol and ibuprofen at all cost. An ear cleanup as uhuck suggested is a very good idea too. Dont go overboard.

Everyones making wooden speakers and trying to make them really solid.  But why not make speakers with a more solid material than wood?  Theres this German company that makes speakers using different sorts of stone  marble slate stuff I dont know the proper translation of.Vroemen makes speakers that are really heavy and they claim they dont need to pad the insides of the speakers to avoid reflections because the materials used are stiffer than wood not their words just my interpretation which is probably wrong.  Good tweeters  woofers only work well if they have a backend to support them well.  Im very convinced someone like you can build a speaker with good components that sounds very  very  well if they take more into account than just the components.Im also convinced a company can make average or slightly expensive tweeters  woofers sound very very well if they take cabinet design  material choice very seriously.TLDR   Yes I think you can DIY speakers that outperform speakers that cost  of what you spent.    No I dont think you can DIY speakers that look better than speakers costing  more   Yes I think that DIYers need to spend more time on the visuals  sure its nice if they sound better than everything else but it would be really nice if they wouldnt look like stacked boxes! ,audioengineering,ct8yt16,1,t5_2qkby

This mixer is plugged into an outlet with a poor ground. Current flows from the mixergtspeakergtoutletground rather than mixergtoutletground because the speakers ground is better and is therefore the path of least resistance. You will hear this in the speaker as a hz buzz.

4701539,1,t3_3fbqf2,Your best bet is to try and EQ the response problem out of them. The designer of the speakers put in baffle step compensation into the crossover to deal with narrow baffle width vs the size of lower frequency sound waves. Close placement to a boundary messes with that formula.  You can get sceintific with this and pull out the ruler and figure out what wave lengths need to be cut or you can take a couple of measurements. I would take one with one speaker out away from the wall and then one with that one speaker closer to the wall and look at the lower midrange and bass response should be a boost that will start at a certain frequency and smoothly increase. Cut that gain out ignoring sharp spikes from room modes with as low a Q filter as you can and call it done.,audioengineering,ctn61cm,-1,t5_2qkby

I think higherend plugin compressors are better.That said the advantage of the RNC would be if youre running separate mic preamps and converters because you could compress after the preamp and before the converters.My personal opinion is that until you have ultimate mics preamps and converters you should use software EQ comp and reverb.They are secondary in importance to the stuff you use to actually capture the audio.Just my opinion tho.,audioengineering,cupjqmy,3,t5_2qkby

Is this because theyre too far away from the wall or because the car stereo colours the sound?,audioengineering,cuw4nun,1,t5_2qkby
5062056,0,t3_3k7hq8,Ive actually done this. I recorded all the vocals for a full length album in an old Honda because I was in a situation similar to yours. I bought a usb condenser mic and brought my laptop into the car.  But before recording I would set up a daw session exclusively for the vocals with an MP bounce of the instrumental as the only other track to preserve memory on the laptop and sustain the battery life. Then once in the car I would record the vocals against the MP.  After recording the vocals I would export the stems or just the raw WAV files and import them into the full session once completed.  To me it was more efficient and cheaper than going to a studio.The downside is that you have to eq a littler harder because the car does create a boxy tone. Also singing while sitting down kind of constricts your airflow so getting the best takes might be a little difficult. Other than that its pretty fool proof.

Where I lost interest was with the vocal. Its pretty honkynasal in the mids making it feel thin and out of context to the beat. Id compress the vocal a little harder too low ratio slow attack fast release and then take it to smash town.

Honestly its not really that bad.

About half the guitars and basses Ive used directin are way too hot for it and my snare drum will clip the overhead mic even at zero gain and like  feet away.

5254899,0,t1_cvja4an,Get your head wrapped around the idea of mixing and summing. Your average DAW software is just a virtualized mixing board with multiple channels of audio all getting combined at bus stages and then finally at the master. Play around with cubase or something to get an idea.After that I would focus very hard on EQ and levels. Really learn the frequency spectrum and the characteristics of the different frequency ranges. hz vs hz vs hz vs khz they all sound different and you are definitely going to want to cut them in some instruments to keep them from clashing with the intelligibility of another instrument.Then theres compression.

If you EQ the wedge so that it sounds good any peaks in the frequency response that would cause feedback are going to be the first things you naturally eliminate. Ive been using just parametrics to shape the tone of the wedge for quite a while and a wedge that sounds good and even with nothing poking out of it is going to get quite loud without feeding back especially with good microphone technique.

Dont get me wrong I absolutely advocate reading manuals digging deeper into your gearsoftware and looking for answers on your own. However how do you think those answers got on those forums in the first place? It had to start with someone asking the question people helping them out and then hopefully everyone discovering the correct answer through that dialogue. OPs original mention of the younger generation seems pretty obtuse. When I find answers on gearslutz... how old are those posts? A lot of them are from quite a while back. Each generation of technology changes the way information is disseminated... you think those old road hogs working for the Stones back in the s wouldnt have LOVED to have a forum where they could ask people from around the world for advice tips and troubleshooting info? Providing tech help or really just any assistance at all not just in the world of AE has always been about knowing where to find the information needed.

5604560,0,t1_cwrojgl,You stated in your post Youre asking for a plugin that could do a fairly complex artificial intelligence task...  its not like the computer has any clues on how to match them up.. . If the tracks are bleeding into one another that means their transients are too. As a matter of a fact this is how Ive been fixing the issue so far.  There is a clear copy of each track in every other track granted a low signal one. The plugin Im looking for has a really clear and easy to execute function.  It takes the key tracks transients analyzes another track for them and delays or rate changes one of the tracks so the two synch up.  The computer isnt comprehending  anything. Ill be honest Im trying really hard not to get angry at the responses Ive gotten to this thread.  Its almost as if nobody here understands what phasing is. What Im trying to do isnt the most complicated task anyone has ever thought of and as a matter of a fact its something that is corrected with virtually every drum session recorded nowadays.

5729574,0,t3_3tk0z9,Reading your comments here it sounds like you are tuning your kick too high. Thats great for certain genres where you want to hear the note but it just doesnt fit for most rock. Especially if you are going for a one size fits all rock kick. Try tuning as loose as you can and listen to it while its miced up. Usually the batter head can stay pretty loose and you can slowly tighten the resonant if you need to get the pitch up. Use a small pillow or foam inside to dampen the sustain. And you will probably get better results by micing the resonant head with a port in it. A good way to find the right mic placement for a resonant port is to get someone to hit the kick and put your hand in front of the port moving it slowly into the port until you really feel the impact of the air. Thats where the diaphragm of the mic should go. And if you still really want to hear the pitch of the kick you can always sweep a sharp EQ boost around the low freqs to find and boost the fundamental pitch no matter how low it is. If you still arent hearing it then double the frequency of the fundamental and boost that also ex. hz fundamental would have an octave overtone at hz. But again for a rock kick you dont really need to hear the pitch. You just need a tight punchy low end and a nice high frequency attack.,audioengineering,cx7b5c6,2,t5_2qkby

5763652,0,t1_cx7v2a5,Ill use Mel Blanc as an example. He had a major car accident in . Some of his voiceover work that year was done in a studio set up in his home while he was basically in a lower body cast from a pelvic fracture. Those recordings sound fantastic. Its been revealed that Blancs son did some of those sessions with his father producing and directing him. Nobody could tell the difference.At some point in the early s the recording style changed. More importantly the sound of the characters Mel Blanc voiced changed. My guess is the move was made from  tape and  or  track recording to  and  or more channels. Different board different tape stock and possibly different mics. The natural compression of the older recording machines which Ive had the pleasure of working with they were fabulous and very forgiving and tape gave way to a higher quality recording which actually did not suit cartoon voices. ,audioengineering,cxbj92d,1,t5_2qkby

5827355,0,t3_3v1b0m,I would guess that the chords are probably th chords just going by ear. In my opinion the sound is probably layered sawsquare waves with one oscillator set lower and one oscillator set at a higher interval maybe at a thth or octave. It sounds like they used some unison as well and slightly detuned some of the voices then used a low pass filter to soften the sound a little. The rhythm of the synth is different in each track so Im assuming different modulation sources were used in each track. Flumes track sounds like its using an Envelope to modulate the attack of the volume or possibly a filter. On Louis the Child it sounds like the synth is being modulated by an LFO. There are probably some other effects applied on top such as reverb saturation distortion waveshaping or compression as well as some other layers that sound like distorted horns. Just keep in mind that synthesis is an art form and that there are thousands of different methods to achieve the same results just experiment and youll find your way.,audioengineering,cxjhpps,5,t5_2qkby

Have them turn amps down or away from the vocalist. The drummer needs to play quieter as well. Then the vocalist needs to take some singing lessons to learn diaphragm control so she can sing with some volume. The sound of the band is a team effort.  If some or all of the band doesnt want to help they need to be replaced. Other than that you could buy som huge wedges and biamp them.

6284934,0,t3_41ojgs,Reposting here on recommendation.Ive decided to toss a bit of Darth Vader voice shenanigans into my next home movie project and as with any such endeavor I like to be as accurate and as thorough as possible. For something like simulating the Darth Vader vocal characteristics that means trying to pin down what effects are needed to get it right.I will admit upfront that when I took on this little personal challenge I felt pretty confident that today after  years of Star Wars the particulars of successfully achieving the sound would be wellestablished down to the nitty gritty. This turned out to be naive. Instead most how to explanations more or less end once theyve explained the obvious that youll more than likely need to pitch your voice down a few semitones without preserving formants. Pretty much after that every guide has their own idea of what comes next  usually a tiny bit of chorus or ring modulator using always different settings whatever it takes to make it sound like its coming out of a mask  and none of them sound really anything like the original. You end up with something that sounds muffled and robotic but that ends up being basically a cliche and not really much at all what Darth Vader generally sounds like.So lets examine the original. It turns out if you go hereyou can find a nice set of mostly isolated bits of Darth Vader dialogue. First thing worth noticing is that the exact sound of the voice differs between movies A New Hope vs. Empire Strikes Back for example and sometimes between scenes. Because of this Ive decided to focus on a specific sound and use that as my goalpost.That sound can be heard in the quote I find your lack of faith disturbing. Listen to that line. If theres any chorus going on it is very subtle indeed. If theres any particular quality thats making it sound masklike its a distinct ring at about the  to  Hz range. Isolate that range and it can be clearly heard. Other than that it really mostly sounds just like a normal recording whatever else is responsible for the Darth Vader qualities is too vague for me to pin down.Im basically hoping someone has a good idea of what Im missing and certainly what might enable the  Hz effect described above. If its a ring modulator exactly what settings and how wet? If its something else same deal. Tiny differences really matter for something like this. I throw myself at the mercy of the experts.Thanks in advance.,audioengineering,cz40ya3,2,t5_2qkby

6576258,0,t1_czzhlw0,I had a brief email exchange with Tony Visconti about this very subject once. It was after he had a polite disagreement with The Moody Blues about doing a record the way they used to do it. They wanted analog tape. After three days of preproduction in which they were merely trying to buy tape that wasnt shit and trying to get a disused tape machine to function well enough he decided it would be digital or he would bow out of the project. A young interviewer set a tone of pining for the good ole days of warm and fuzzy analog tape with Tony. The venerable Mr Visconti corrected the interviewers misconceptions of analog and spent a bit of time recounting a few seriously flawed sessions that were mostly trashed by analog. He was essentially saying this that classic recordings were made great in spite of vintage gear not because of it. I have an immense respect for those like Visconti and his contemporaries who made visionary works many of them masterpieces despite the immense limitations of analog tape and mixers. Lovers of music would be perhaps be even more grateful for their work if the knew the extent of patience perseverance and talent it took. There was a large amount of dedication and work in those recordings.Numerous edits clarity and typos. ,audioengineering,czzjeyf,3,t5_2qkby

6780686,0,t1_d0krqq0,A limiter is a type of compressor that seeks to achieve an extremely high ratio with a specific output level that will not be exceeded. In analog compressors that output level could be measured in an exact voltage displayed on a meter and you could know that it would not oversaturate the tape or worse cut a groove too deeply in the vinyl at the time of mastering.A  ratio is considered limiting most of the time but there are compressors that go much higher even in the analog realm. At  for every  decibels above the threshold the signal is raised you get  decibel out  that is signals above a certain level are attenutated to . of their original size. Thats a lot of attenuation.Digital limiters are pretty much brick walls  they have perfect lookahead characteristics below and can keep the signal under the final output pretty much perfectly except that nothing is perfect.Limiters often have a function called lookahead where they can see into the future and know that the peak is going to exceed your absolute maximum and turn itself down so that you never clip. There are realworld mastering limiters that have this  again you dont want to cut vinyl too deeply thats a total disaster  and it was carried over into the digital world where clipping your converters usually sounds awful but sometimes thats done intentionally too. Again though realistically nothing is perfect and even with ideal lookahead you can still occasionally exceed the final limit.Using a limiter to increase the overall volume of your final mix has more to do with the general process of compressing than anything that has to do with a limiter. A limiter is basically going to chop off the top peaks the parts of your mix that are the most dynamic. If you just turned up the volume youd get clipping. If you turn up the volume but have a limit on the peaks the whole thing comes up but the peaks are reduced. Like everything else in compression you are limiting the dynamic range.Dont use a limiter JUST to make the mix louder for the sake of making the mix louder. Ill let someone who knows more about mastering tell you this because while I have my own philosophy on that Im hardly an expert.,audioengineering,d0kvimt,3,t5_2qkby

7041016,0,t3_4c2cij,Simple filters are modeled by first and second order differential equations. The Bode plot of a first order filter either RC or RL is relatively smooth without the characteristic resonant bump but a second order RCL ie. filter has a slight bump at its resonance with height determined by the Q factor of the resonant circuit. Physically this has to do with the resonant interaction between the capacitor and the inductor in the circuit. This gets more complicated with multiple order Butterworth Bessel etc. filters but the above explanation still holds with some modifications to how the Bode plot looks...As far as digital filters go they try to recreate different styles of analog filters but technically dont have to  the sound just ends up more pleasing if they do sometimes.

The received wisdom was that this was a big error to make and your experience is a good example of why that is. You should only compress or use filters during mix unless its something like a noise gate or an absolutely necessary application on some kind of problem source. Maybe mild compression on some things but certainly nothing major. Sometimes a vocalist will want a bit of reverb or some other filter that goes into their monitor mix and not onto the recording media.

Try to perform it using the same dynamics you will be using when you go in to record for real. You can set up your compressor and eq before these dummy tracks if you want. Then go ahead and just try mixing those lines into the mix. Hit it with whatever you think it needs. Reverb delay saturation multiband. The key is to not use anything that will cause latency parallel compression for example. Too much processing can cause this latency so if you have to bounce a crude instrumental mix out so that all of your resources can be used on the vocal mix in a new session than do so. When you are done just turn off all of your plugins and ENSURE ALL FADERS ARE SET TO made this mistake more than once then bounce out your dry vocals for mixing. ,audioengineering,d38580p,1,t5_2qkby

7637657,0,t3_4jwybm,When stereo came out a lot of people didnt really know how to use it properly. By that I mean there was really no conventional wisdom that we have now like bass and lead vocal up the middle overheads left and right etc. We now take that all for granted. A lot of mono recordings were put into stereo afterthefact and not always with the artist or original mixer usually just the engineer in those days around. So you get weird decisions like throwing all the bass on one side and all the lead vocals on the other. If you listen to Beatles mono mixes they make SO much more sense. Gone is the quirkydirky thin sounding weird stereo bullshit and you get these really solid powerful mixes that give you an idea of how the band really sounded. Yellow Submarine Abbey Road and Let it Be were all mixed stereo to begin with which is why they sound better in stereo than the earlier albums. ,audioengineering,d3acxde,7,t5_2qkby

But thats not a problem if all you want to do is make measurements.As for the software knowing how to draw a waveform despite it having only a few samples a sine is typically used.  With a .k sample rate starting around kHz its all going to be sine waves since all harmonics above kHz are removed by the antialiasing filter.,audioengineering,d54mels,1,t5_2qkby

8218156,0,t3_4rvyh6,This is most likely because the outlets you are using are not properly ground. If you are in an older houseapartmentbuilding it is most certainly the case. How to testPlug your PC into a completely separate outlet on a completely different wall. I dont mean move it from the top slot down to the bottom slot of the same outlet or using a power strip or something like that I mean a COMPLETELY different outlet. Either on a different wall in the same room or in a completely different room. You may need to use an extension cord to reach one. The PC should be the only thing plugged into this.Leave everything else you use monitors interface etc. plugged into where they are now. Like I said you may need an extension cord so you can plug the PC into a different outlet without moving it.If the problem goes away your outlets are not properly ground.If the problem does not go away then it is an internal problem that is nearly impossible to fix without replacing parts on your PC. The most common cause is a higher end graphics card. If you have one remove it and see if it fixes it. If it doesnt then it could be anything in your PC. The only way to test would be to take everything out one at a time and see if anything fixes it. If you find what causes it replace the part with a different brand but that being said it is highly likely the same problem occurs again.,audioengineering,d54tps0,1,t5_2qkby

8247077,0,t1_d588k1n,Mixing and mastering engineers have very separate roles that work hand in hand together. A mixing engineer takes all the individual tracks could be  could be  and mixes them down to a stereo track. Thats his job. Make individual performances gel together. Think a woodworker building a table. All the individual pieces to become an awesome table. The mastering engineer is the guy who stains it and coats it. The song is done. The table is done. There is no tweaking individual elements the goal is to take it from where its at and make the overall thing even better. Mastering am album can lead to levelling the sound across the board so you dont have a quiet song that you have to turn up and the next song is so loud your ears bleed. He might make Eq adjustments so the tonal characteristics are similar. Again the mastering engineer receives the final mix he just makes it better. disclaimer there are some serious generalizations in this Im just trying to hopefully enlighten. ,audioengineering,d58fuvp,3,t5_2qkby

8296173,0,t3_4t3lsu,Hearing that price I picture a very highend studio with live rooms iso booths a control room stocked with a  channel NeveSSL console all the preampscompsEqs you could ever want and a Grammy winning engineer along the lines of Bruce Swedien or George Massenburg highly competent engineer.  The kind of place that an established label backed band would go to.  At those prices you need to be completely rehearsed and ready to nail scratch tracks in a few takes so that you can spend more time on overdubs and vocals.  If I were in your place I would look into doing a less expensive home studio type of recording.  Another option is to find an engineer whos willing to bring gear to your rehearsal space and do a long weekend of mostly live tracking with some overdubs then do vocals as a separate set of sessions.   Personally Im a fan of doing Vacation sessions.  Basically you rent a house or cabin somewhere and everyone holes up for a few days to bang out a bunch of live takes.  The last one I did was four days in a lake house.  First day was spent rearranging all the furniture and setting up the drums and recording gear while everyone trickled in. We did a few jams that night and tracked one song.  Next two days were spent doing live takes of the rest of the songs.  We did  tunes total and it took about two hours to bang out  takes of each one.  The musicians were on point and had rehearsed everything prior so there wasnt much fiddling around.  The first seven or eight takes would be used to dial everything in and then  were typically the good ones with the last take usually being when they started going downhill.   We sprinkled overdubs in here and there like wed have a guitar player do his solos while everyone else was eating dinner or taking smoke breaks.  We also had time for random jam sessions which lead to a few impromptu tracks.  The last day we did some clap tracks a tambourine take  final overdubs and rough mix listening.  We didnt do any vocals we planned to do those separate.  These type are sessions are really fun if you have a great group of people.  Its a get away for everyone involved and feels less like work.  I feel the musicians are also a little more relaxed and have less of the studio jitters which can happen when youre on the clock and feel like you need to get everything just perfect.  EDIT Grammy winning engineers cost a LOT.  ,audioengineering,d5ekw4x,1,t5_2qkby
8298388,0,t3_4t4mjp,I use gates and expanders a lot more in live sound than I do in the studio.In studio I will sometimes sidechain a gentle vocal expander usually a cc for different levels of expansion for each frequency band from the  guitar or keyboard if that guitar or keyboard is doing a lot of swell or changing volume regularly within the course of one song. I find it lets the vocal flow over the instruments with a more natural feel rather than simply compressing the instruments volume levels.I have also sidechain expanded kick mics with a C on a D or a M sidechained to an internal beta to increase the punch or thwack in a mic thats usually more of a thump while avoiding having to EQ the mic all the time and possibly pick up frequencies from snare or rack toms by accident.In live sound though thats where the expander and gate really shine. Running monitors especially inear monitors vocalists LOVE a gentle sometimes not so gentle expander on their vocals. When theyre building up to hit big high notes their voices get louder than they expect faster than they expect. Makes them feel big and powerful and improves their performance because they think theyre having a GREAT vocal day.Gates are more of a Front of House mixing tool. We use the high ratio gates for different drums on a drum kit because theres really two settings for most live drums Its being hit and Its not being hit. As long as the gate opens for all volume levels of its being hit while staying mostly closed for not being hit it cleans up the drum sound spectacularly well. But gentle gates are the real power behind FoH mixing. I gate everything at front of house vocals drum overheads guitar and bass mics even DIs but theyre gentle gates. I keep the thresh low the ratio somewhere between  and  and bring the range up to just  or even dB. Having the small range means that even when the gate is fully closed youre only decreasing the level out of that channel by  or dB. Its still audible but if the microphone is unattended or the instrument is not being used it cuts out some of the noise of an open channel in a live environment. The point here is that gentle gating should be easy to overcome just walking up to a cardioid mic in a live environment is usually enough to set the gate fluttering through proximity effect on a loud stage. Its only to quiet a microphone that might otherwise be phasing the instruments on stage and muddying the mix.,audioengineering,d5euui4,10,t5_2qkby

8375433,0,t3_4ublmd,Compression is absolutely right. Personally heres how I would do it    Id pick something with a soft knee. Find the quitest track and adjust your compression settings until you get about  dB of Gain Reduction and adjust your output gain to add those dB back into your signal. You can pass everything through a limiter with a soft knee on your output to bring everything close to dB without clipping.    After that  depending on the DAW you use  you can probably save those compressor settings and simply apply them to the louder VO tracks. Just make sure to listen to them so that you know that they dont sound too overcompressed.,audioengineering,d5oh97v,1,t5_2qkby

Get foil backed  style installation and make some of those and hang  of them each on  Z carts and form a V shape with you at the apex. You can also get the reflection busters from SE electronics.

If your recording signal is just really low you can download Audacity and Normalize the signal to add gain.  This will also bring up the background noise.  If the voices are still too low compared to the louder voices you could try using a free compression plugin. Again the background hiss is going to increase dramatically.  If you want to purchase something to help you could get a battery powered boundry mic like this  This kind of microphone takes away the reflections from the table and will generally just sound better.

Try and go back and forth between your mix and their mix and make sure they are at a comparable volume since the pro mix will likely be mastered. if you do take a mix to the car try and do the same thing. it also helps to have a trained ear in regards to what frequencys are giving you problems.

8527721,0,t1_d66uy5v,PaddingThere are all kinds of foam padding. Some absorb. Some repel. Some bounce. For booths I tend to like absorption padding. But something for the dimension of a room I would use some padding that at least keeps the sound contained. That static you hear are frequencies and unwanted noise traveling around the room. Against walls for example  Thats why some slight padding might be needed. You dont want too much padding and destroy too much of the rooms acoustics either . Itd be almost like suffocating your recordings. Especially when designing a booth for yourself too.Noise Gate Noise Gate is a plugin. Actually another form of a compressor really. This chick is kinda stupid but you can see what it basically does in this link.Its usually something used during post production. Its not that it would remove the sound when youre not talking. It takes out excess in recordings. Yes it may help when youre not talking but to use one during recording might take away from your recording because you dont know how much the noise gate compressor is taking out because youre still in the recording progress. Make sense? lol. Your setupIts actually not a bad set up you have there. For shields that Ive seen you might need a new mic stand altogether if you plan on getting one. Based on your setup a mic shield might be wise to get rid of the excess of sound bouncing towards your monitors. That crannycloset looking part where it all sits might echo recordings slightly. But whats most important is whats behind you when youre recording because i believe most mics especially condensor mics will pick up sound from behind you. Kind of like a triangle. The top of the triangle would begin at the mic and going out towards that wall I cant see in your picture. And how well that sound travels all depends on how your room is set up and goes back to what we were talking about with padding and other shit. It is kind of a pain in the ass finding the perfect mic position padding position etc. and even I have driven myself crazy trying to find that perfect sweet spot in the room but its definitely something you should consider when designing your setup.

Maybe its just a transitional period with technology before some kind of development makes these things actually helpful for the business. Its definitely not helping professionals at this moment though and many people who use it are looked down upon by others.I dont really have a short term answer to your question.I do have a long term answer because quite honestly thats often what it takes. Not all of these steps will be feasible for you and not all of them guarantee success but if you do as many of them as you can you will increase your chances for success in the long run. . Move to a large city with a strong music scene e.g. Los Angeles or New York. . Get a solid education from a university with a brand name that will allow you to network and to have a resume that works to get your foot in the door e.g. USC UCLA Berklee NYU etc.  . Get internships. Maybe  or . Work your butt off and make friends with the people you work with. . Say yes to every project that you think may be at or above your skill level. . Do everything you can to network with artists and industry professionals in meaningful ways. . Work so hard at every aspect of music songwriting engineering producing mixing etc. that you become undeniably talented and knowledgeable.. Keep a good work ethic dont cheat work on your character and over time you will have a solid reputation that will keep your phone ringing with calls from clients who are willing to pay you what you deserve for interesting professional projects.. Profit...maybe...depends on how the industry is doing and how easy technology has made engineering by the year .If it was easy many more people would be doing it.One alternative to this list is to scrap your sessions together with whatever you can find for the bare minimum price and be willing to do rushed work on bad projects with bad management.Another alternative is to get noticed by working on an incredible personal project. If you can make your own album that gets noticed many people will be interested in talking with you. This is quite difficult.A third alternative is to save a large amount of money in another profession thats easier to be successful in. Do it for   years while you practice your audio skills privately. Get out of that business invest in a pro studio that will wow people and close clients despite you not having pro experience. You may have to float yourself for a while which is easier with investors but if you own good facilities you may be able to make it work. You could even hire an engineer with experience to draw clients in at first. I just realized Im probably rambling and none of this may be relevant to your question.

9094799,0,t1_d84hktj,I would avoid haas only because Ive never liked it. There are ways to widen tracks that collapse to mono much better.The best way particularly for vocals is a plugin like This. Or This if you want to get crazy. Or just search Microshift plugin. There are some good free options out there. What its doing is splitting the tracking into left and right channels and slightly modulating the pitch of each side. You can do this using the method I describe below but a plugin just does the math for you and does it all in one channel. If you have a nice subtle chorus you like duplicate one track pan L and R then set a chorus on each with different time setting. Make sure your times arent multiples of each other I.E. one at .Hz and one at Hz. Youll find it very noticeably collapsing to mono once every second. You can do the above method with just about any timebased effect. The difference is when it collapses to mono it doesnt just sound out of phase. You keep that sense of space and you get perfect control over how wide you can mix it with the dry signal without more phasing etc.,audioengineering,d851rwi,3,t5_2qkby

Perfect is fucking boring. Honest sounds good.However if you need to do this to a click just have the dude practice with a click. Also its often helpful to replace the standard click sound with a tambourine or something. It feels less antiseptic to the drummer while theyre tracking.

If you are relatively new to music recording yes Im old and still spend hrs a week in a studio you might not understand that a most sound sources and studios were not as HiFifull spectrum as they are now or b that the musical arrangement itself left space in time or pitch for all instrument to be heard by not having everything playing at once except very short passages.    Please take a moment and go back and listen to music that is generally regarded as Sonically Full Led Zeppelin ACDC run DMC Sex Pistols it doesnt matter whether its metal rock dance hiphop or old school.

And you heard right class Ds are really efficient so you shouldnt worry about it. A class D outputting W will run cooler than an AB at W no matter what the input voltage I think  I could use a double check on that because running at a lower voltage would require more amps to deliver the same power. Even if the voltage determined the heat output that would still be overpowered by the fact that AB efficiency tops out around  often closer to  while class D efficiency is often around . So for the same thermal waste a class D can give you  more power to the speakers.  ,audioengineering,d8617xj,1,t5_2qkby

The comp will then play back through the board through the preamps and eqs and back in to the system.  But then you will have to rerecord each track after mixing on the board or photographing or marking all your settings and just printing to a stereo file from the board.  This process will probably be WAY cumbersome for the payoff.If anything you can also just use the board for tracking outputting each channel to an input on the scarlett.  This way you can preamplify all the signals and get some of the board flavor into the mix without having to forego the crazy convenience of actually mixing in the box.,audioengineering,d91rphy,2,t5_2qkby

A lot is going to depend on the piano the room and what the pianist wants to hear  just try a few things record some  second chunks and pick the best sounding method for your particular situation  its better to spend a little extra time during setup to make sure youre both happy.,audioengineering,d9c9x7p,3,t5_2qkby

9611711,0,t1_d9xsm2i,All of or most of your drum mics are pointed downward i.e. Top of toms snares and overheads. Theyre capturing the sound pressure change as it moves away from your drum moving upwards. Whereas any mic that is pointed up is capturing the sound pressure wave as it moves downward therefore any waveforms captured in that way will be out of phase with your other microphones. Ideally your microphone is only capturing the micd drum but that is never the case. As the snare is hit the sound will bleed into all microphones because the snare is so loud. That bleed indeed will be out of phase in any mic that is pointed opposite the other microphones.

Unmastered mixes will be lower in volume than mastered tracks and thus wont sound as full or lush and simply wont sound as good the louder it is the better it sounds.If at the same volume your tracks are still lacking this would lead me to ask at what volume did you work with in the studio? If it sounded great at the studio while you were listening to it at a louder volume than you generally listen music to youve actually been tricked by your brain into thinking that it sounded great the louder it is the better it sounds.Anyways there is an online computerized works with algorithms mastering service not sure I can give up the name here but you should google it easily. Id rather advise you to get an actual human doing your mastering especially if your unsure of the quality of your mixes but this service lets you have mastered mp versions of your tracks for free and you can try different loudness levels for your songs. So it could help you compare your tracks to actual mastered songs if you dont have a DAW around which you know your way.

9900912,0,t3_5h841k,This is almost always an issue of playing technique but there are a few things that can help if you want more string definition in your distorted sound.  Use less gain on the amp use the least possible amount you can deal with.  When you play distorted pickingchording parts practice digging in with the pick more aggressively.  You might have to practice a bit to do with without playing out of tune hitting the strings hard can make them jump sharp if youre not careful but once you get the picking technique down itll improve your tone a lot and add clarity.  The added aggressiveness will also make it so that you dont need as much gain from the amp.    Make sure your guitar has fresh strings.  As strings start to wear and it can happen within hours of playing they lose highend clarity which is what you need to hear the string definition through the distortion in the tone.  You can also use heavier gauge strings to thicken the tone and keep the tuning more stable.  Ive done a lot of records where weve changed strings every song or two because it makes a noticeable difference.,audioengineering,day41ac,10,t5_2qkby

9961215,0,t3_5i73m6,Dont be nervous about it just think of it like a musician friend bringing tracks to you and saying I need a fast mix of this to send as a demo that is required this afternoon. You already know how to use audio workstation software and hardware mixers so you can easily do a quick mix for them that will have instruments and voices balanced appropriately but to your taste perhaps some compression on tracks that need it reverb where needed and Channel EQ.One thing that is common in Tonmeister programs is for the professor to watch a mix and then ask a question about it  such as why did you put a highpass filter on the vocal.  So perhaps do a few quick practice mixes on multitrack sources that you find somewhere and as you work think if they ask why am I doing this EQ what will I tell them and this is the sort of reverb I like on vocals why do I choose it? It is fine to answer I saw the mix engineer at my internship do it and I liked the result or I read an article where the engineer described doing it this way so I thought it might be a good thing to try. But if you have technical or artistic explanations that is even better. They are very much looking for potential and part of that potential is technical knowledge.

It is said they are the best analog mixers for mixing. Ive got one too but it is stored in a friends garage and I can not figure out if he is trying to steal it from me I am sad to say. I am not too worried about it as the thing is so heavy to move. I went with a newer mixer for the studio all crispy and new. The Harrison thing is like a daydream or distraction just too much to do right now to deal with it but it needs a full maintenance recap. I thought of one day just paying someone else to do it. I have had this happen a couple of times where I get a nonindustry person involved with a piece of kit or an instrument and then they get all weird like a little kid stealing a candy bar. I sold a guy a guitar one time one of the first from a builder and a year later dude is like I dont know you. Bizarre stuff. Stick with industry lifers! These were social friends of mine but the kit showed some unexpected character weakness in them. I have so much of this stuff it is just falling off the edges. I need to retract. Seriously.I had the Harrison discussion with another guy who said the pres are not that great for cutting therefore concept use something else for pre front end and use the H for mixing very simple concept.

10225504,0,t3_5mb9y7,Several things to considerCAD isnt a bad company. Theyre USowned theyve been around a long time and their products are good for budget mics.Spending more money doesnt buy you a better product. A better microphone will usually cost more money but price is not a direct indicator of quality.The right microphone is the one that sounds right. Thats it. If you trust your expenditure more than your ears youre doin it wrong.As others have said there is very little lowend in the CAD recording. This isnt necessarily something you can EQ back into the recording if you need it.Okay a little more detailed breakdown of the technology here.The CAD is an electret condenser. The sE is a true externally polarized condenser. An electret capsule is cheaper to build. The circuitry required to turn it into a good microphone is less complicated and thus cheaper to engineer do a circuitboard for and build. The sEs capsule costs more for all those things. is not a lot of money for a microphone. Theres often very little difference between a  and  mic. In fact there are many  microphones that are the same as  microphones except for tighter tolerances on the capsules which might be made in the same factory as the  mic.USB powered Your CAD is powered by a fairly wimpy USB supply and has to contain its own preamp digital conversion etc. This is really limiting.  sounds like a bargain for all that but what if you dont like how the preamp in it sounds? You cant do anything about it! What if the DA conversion isnt good enough? Youre stuck with it! In other words the sE electronics can follow you to better interfaces and preamps the i is marginally better in many ways like the noise figures but maybe not in ways that are important to you while the CAD will always and only be what it already is.,audioengineering,dc349g8,2,t5_2qkby

Theyd also both be ruffled in different patterns. From what I gather the spacing between the moving blankets would help dampen the sound created though I was told  would be preferable Im also trying to keep the aesthetic of things looking ok as well.As well as the spacing the blankets would have a slight ruffle as well to help with sound absorption.In theory it should all work quite well while being cheap too.

You seem to not understand how the statistics work.gtThe conclusion from what you have presented is NOT that there is nothing there but that the difference is so small that most people dont hear it but some do and some are uncertain.MampMs paper showed that people achieved results very close to blind guessing when trying to distinguish hires audio and CDquality audio. The McGill paper that you refer to actually confirms this although the authors obfuscate this fact either by design or by accident.On  out of  samples the participants essentially just guessed because they were unable to tell apart the different sample rates.On the last sample orchestral excerpt the result is less definite but this does not mean they could actually tell the different sample rates apart it could simply be blind guessing as with the other samples with some statistical uncertainty.Still only  of the  participants actually achieved results that could be classified as not guessing. That is not statistically significant.gtI hope you are finally starting to see my point. You cannot interview people to get a definitive answer about this issue because no one can know with certain fact what they can and cannot hear. Period. You need a futuristic brain implant to chart the auditory nerve responses.This is exactly why double blind tests are used. You eliminate bias and personal factors they only thing the participants are asked to do is to listen to two different samples and select the one that is higher quality.If the distribution of answers is as random as in the McGill paper there is an extremely high probability that the participants could not hear a difference irrespective of whether they thought they heard a difference or not so they simply guessed.gtAnother issue that I have raised is ear experience. If youre going to try and pick this study apart focus on the fact that ten of these  subjects were students.So now youre agreeing that the McGill paper is flawed at best? And this was supposed to convince me that higher sample rates have audible benefits?gtI would do a blind test with nothing but audio engineer veterans but you would be hard pressed to find many that would give a fuck about giving their time for these experiments.Yes because they know how silly it is. However there are a number of veterans from the audio industry on forums such as Gearslutz or Hydrogenaudio and some of them have either participated in double blind tests or even run such tests themselves. Ill let you guess what their findings were And this is completely ignoring the elephant in the room. If higher sample rates actually had supposedly amazing benefits for sound quality as claimed by countless audiophiles and vendors selling SACDs and hires audio downloads at extortionate prices shouldnt it be an absolute walk in the park to pick out the hires samples in a double blind test?Or to put it another way If it is so hard to pick out the difference in a double blind test as it seems to be why are the claims of audible benefits so ridiculously blown out of proportion by the people who claim to be able to hear the difference?Sample rates higher than .kHz have been used for decades and decades and available as consumer formats SACD DVDA downloads etc. also for decades but no one has been able to prove any audible benefit at all. The audiophile world would go absolutely hogwild for a wellwritten paper about unassailable tests that finally and unequivocally proves the audibility of hires audio so why hasnt anyone written one yet?,audioengineering,dds285m,1,t5_2qkby
10791279,0,t3_5ub748,If your mics are good enough and your room is quiet enough then you could just go for longer distance mic setupless direct positioning and use your software limiters or compressors to keep it all loud. As long as there is no clipping before the signal is recorded to digital you should be able to get your levels good automatically.  The problem with this is most of the time you will have introduced a lot of room noise. More reverberations and your mouse clicks and keypresses. Just orienting the mics so they dont point directly in the direction people will be yelling will also make a big difference. Other than that you would really want a good limiter or compressor between your mic and your pc or in your current setup your mixer. It may be worth it to get a multichannel interface that comes with that integrated. I would first experiment with mic placement and software compressionlimiting though. Just get your friend to sit there yelling straight ahead  and move your mic around. Note where it needs to be to never get clipping. Choose the best sounding position that doesnt ever clip then get him to ramble normally with yell spikes and setup a software configuration to fix your loudness and see what thats like. Think of his vocal projection kind of like a spray bottle. If its right in the beam thats the worst if you yell straight into it. If that doesnt work to your satisfaction youll need to invest in some gear.One other way could be dual mic setups. Setup a close mic for regular talking and when they yell switch to the far mic. That will require post production work though. ,audioengineering,ddt1lp3,2,t5_2qkby

Last is easiest diffusion is complex and reflections are costly means essentially building new walls.... But diffusion is also the least dramatic and does not skew frequency response so one can not overuse it.So basically Im measuring how much of each frequency there is? And adding treatment to reduce certain frequency ranges? Lighter materials tamp those higher sounds?Thanks so much!,audioengineering,dfg1cn8,1,t5_2qkby

11378309,0,t1_dflp2xw,No I have mics running into the  with everything zeroed out in the daw I set my levels on the interface I aim for peaks at db that I monitor in the daw then I give them a quick mix in the daw then once the music is recorded in your computer the interface is pretty much only controlling the levels you hear the mix coming out of our speakers or headphones at assuming youre not messing with the volume of the master out in your daw.Basically the only time youre hitting the preamps is on the way into the computer. Gain staging can start to become an issue if youre stacking more preamps and compressors before the preamps in the interface. Run any piece of the puzzle with too much gain and your interface could be getting a distorted or clippy mess even with the interface preamp turned all the way down. ,audioengineering,dflpniq,1,t5_2qkby

11499646,0,t1_dfua1s1,Directionality of a PZM is usually like an omni but only half a circle. If its on a wall it will tend to pick up the whole room because everything is in front of it. If it is on the table it will pick up everything from the table top amp up not foot shuffles amp things going on below the table. Sandwiching it between  layers of open cell foam may localise the sound even more you would need to carve a bit of a hole in the middle to house the PZM. This would also disguise the mic and make it look like a small black block on the table. Along these lines any tiny lapel mic omni pattern could be placed anywhere on the table to get a reasonable speech recording. It could be hidden in a stuffed toy ideally a radio mic so there is no cable. Although then there might be problems if the child wants to play with it. Is there a lamp on the table? That will have a power cable. A lapel mic can be hidden in the lampshade or clipped to the base and the mic cable runs along side or twisted around the power cable. Usually lapel mics have very light cables. If you find one that is the same colour as the lamp power cable then the children wont notice. Probably no one will notice not even the lawyers unless you point it out to them. If the cable is black and the lamp is white use a bit of gaffa tape to hide it. People have suggested shotgun mics. These have good directionality and can be used at much greater distances. But unfortunately they are long pointy things that stand out a bit. It will be hard to set them up anywhere without it being obvious.,audioengineering,dfzhgjk,1,t5_2qkby

11620544,0,t3_65tl5d,I had similar issues when my windows PC was plugged into my active monitors also HSs but not from my MBP.   As youve identified its CPU noise getting into the system somehow you hear it on the monitors because they are active monitors so its a low level signal coming out of the computer that gets amplified later whereas your headphone signal is amplified in the computer.I solved it by using the optical out on my PC soundcard to an external receiver.  That worked ok as I was just using the PC for general gaming listening etc and wanted to run it through the mixer and monitors all my production was being done on the MBP which didnt have that problem.  If youre using your PC for production then you dont really have that option.I did see some posts on here a while back about certain BIOS settings or overclocking causing CPU noise problems   ,audioengineering,dgd76yc,5,t5_2qkby

11648387,0,t3_65zghz,There is an alternative method you can use either seperately or in conjunction with parallel compression.Effectively its softclip style compression.What you do is set a low ratio . give or take a fast attack of around ms and release to taste.Now set the make up gain to the same amount you would like to increase the ghost notes by.  During the loudest section lower the threshold until the compressed signal sounds about the same level as the bypassed signal.Now go to a more quieter passage and compare it with the bypassed signal. Make some fine adjustment of the settings to taste.This also works well if your compressor is capable of a soft knee characteristic.Additionally you can blend a parallel track in with this for added effect. Extra options are always helpful.,audioengineering,dggcxar,1,t5_2qkby

If the song has already been published then under US copyright law anyone and everyone has a right to create and sell new recordings of new performances of that alreadypublished song see note below. Its called a compulsory license compulsory meaning that the copyright holder cannot refuse to grant the license and anyone who wants it can have it. You do not need the artists permission to perform record and sell covers of their songs but you do have to pay them royalties.This is a special exemption carved out of the law specifically for song copyright. It does not apply to samples lyric sheets derivative works parodies band logos or trademarks nor to movies books or other aspects of copyright law. If you think I am wrong please look up compulsory license before responding instead of throwing a bunch of sand in the air about the meaning of copyright. Better yet just read the link from the copyright office. note for the record there are certain exceptions on how compulsory license recordings can be sold that are not directly related to this conversation. Specifically if you want to broadcast the new recordings or sell them to jukebox services etc then you have to go through other royaltylicensing channels. You can still absolutely do those things its just a different set of rules than the compulsory license. ,audioengineering,dgvk5ok,1,t5_2qkby
