8614460,0,t1_d6i9kdn,Just my handiwork in typing up a made up server name. Its the same one as before.That does help. Im wondering if my nginx or server itself is messing up. I suppose I could try from a machine on my LAN when I get home have no remote access to a machine just the firewall and if that works it would probably tell me which one is at fault if not both. ,letsencrypt,d6ielgs,1,t5_36or8
