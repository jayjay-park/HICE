2725799,0,t3_2r824l,Due to Absolutions complete lack of replay value I saw trilogy having never picked up the actual revamped trilogy.    To me the Hitman missions in previous games were so fun and replayable because you unlocked more weapons and attachments that you could use on those missions. Absolution loses this mechanic and every time you start a mission you typically start with a non silenced gun which makes going around and stealthily killing people repetitive because theres only so many ways to garrote people. The missions are so linear though that you can bring a weapon from level a to level b but if you load directly into b you only get what they give you.    Additionally unless they revamped the contractschallenges on Absolution you get a very frustrating online experience. If you create a missioncontract you can take  hours to perfectly kill three targets but anyone who plays your mission only gets about  minutes after the first kill to finish the job without losing money.    Absolution is graphically beautiful but as a Hitman game it missed the mark. ,HiTMAN,cndwuds,2,t5_2rn0x

Timothy atleast sounded like him and looked more than this guy.Too much action hitman is about outsmarting an enemy. A hitman movie should not be an action flick. But a pure thriller. A noir movie purely based on story and twists. It should play mind games with a viewer. Where is he? Which one is he? What will he do? Those are the questions that should be asked whilst watching hitman movie. With a big shootout at the end.Hollwood cant make a proper movie based on a video game.

4287019,0,t1_cs8uqjw,Fantastic sounds like they have a good grasp on how to blur the line between stealth and action in a way that is immersive and adds depth. The biggest problem with the old hitmans was always the gamey way in which you would get caught and not really be able to get back into cover.Im just so relieved that one of my favorite old stealth franchises is back on the right track. I had gotten so used to the idea that Blood Money Chaos Theory and MGS were the golden years of hardcore stealth and that the genre was doomed to degenerate into the likes of Conviction Absolution and MGS.

4307083,0,t1_csb46so,I disagree. In my opinion the fact that he is religious and can clearly see a difference between good and bad made him a believable character. You can see that hes struggling and is actually a humanlike character. Hes not just another badass serial killer that just kills because why not. Its the fact that he tries to work out a way to not live a life that he was created for is why his character works. It is why I personally love agent . His mental struggles and a desire to not just be a mindless murderer. I mean most people probably dont care because they play the game to satisfy the fantasy of becoming this mastermind assassin but some of us really love the storyline presented mostly in Codename  and Silent Assassin Contracts if you delve deeper and manage to see the character developement of our protagonist. Absolutions story was bullshit and I personally couldnt care less about it. And to answer your question  no we dont need to see him in a wheelchair. He ages slower than actual human beings. Im pretty sure that was specified somewhere most likely in OrtMeyers diaries or something like that Im not sure currently. If you think about it he hasnt aged all that much. Codename  took place between  and  Blood Money took place in . ,HiTMAN,csb4tuh,8,t5_2rn0x

Everything is fairly intuitive but assigning the same button for picking up things and performing important actions like opening a door right friggin now was not a good move.You get more options for improvised kills if you choose to take that route.  The overthecounter and aroundthecorner grabs were a nice touch.  Point Shooting though rarely used is a good way of illustrating what kind of badass  can be.  I do like the change to the fiber wire that allows you to automatically drag victims.Nondisguise stealth options are larger in scope which is a good thing because the disguise options are fairly borked.

It had a recognizable hero with clear motivations and two villains each with clear motivations and a colorful cast of supporting characters in an interesting setting. Contrast that with Blood Money which while perhaps more open in its level design had an unclear plot with a nebulous villain in The Franchise that doesnt really resolve so much as it just ends. Yeah the final level is badass but gunning down a guy in a wheelchair at a funeral isnt really as cathartic as going through a bunch of baddies while hunting down your own boss whos a total asshat. ,HiTMAN,d0aj45o,1,t5_2rn0x

7122554,0,t3_4cwxgr,Personally I think a game should only go for an episodic release if the developer is confident enough that the content released allows players to enjoy the level until their next release and doesnt make them bored of whats already there. There is obviously a lot of replayability in Paris and the training stages. But that only lasts for a couple of weeks. It would have been better if they pushed the entire release back gave us a good chunk of the game later on and then went for further episodic DLC that would be there to support the game until the playerbase loses interest and they cant come up with new ideas for good levels. ,HiTMAN,d1nr17j,2,t5_2rn0x

7331505,0,t3_4fs8wc,It can be boring but only if you let it become boring. My xbox says I have played the game for  days  hours and  minutes take away probably  hours having the game paused thats a lot of playtime just from  missions. And I have always had a new experience playing the game each mission attempt prompts me with new opportunities and issues I must overcome. So to answer your question if you dont have the time to spend so many hours just playing around experimenting with each level finding out the dos and donts this probably will be pretty hollow for you. But if you have the time definitely this game talks to the neat freak in me by being consistent pretty much all the time. Hell! I had playthroughs where I would just follow around a certain person which would propose new and exciting ways to fulfill my contract. And it is also fun to just go around and listen to the people talk I had a guard spout James Bond references at me once I had civilian who was screaming its just a video game when I went on a rampage. And even after all that playing I am still finding new objects and weapons that I had no idea were in the game did anyone know there is a fire poker? I had no idea until recently.

7405692,0,t3_4gp6ho,Just finished my first attempt. The guy in the mansion was easy enough to get first time around. I poisoned him and then pushed him over the cliff.The underground is going to take a LOT of planning. Without knowing the layout before trying it seemed like there wasnt any possible way to get in there undetected. Lots of locked doors and I spotted a wall I probably could have destroyed with a bomb to get in. Since I didnt plan for it I had to brute force my way in.Then I had to destroy the virus. That was a mess since afterwards theres only one exit from the room and it was swarmed with guards reacting to the virus being destroyed. No way out peacefully and the game isnt meant for shootouts.Ill probably start the same way next time but bring a remote bomb for the breakable wall unless I can find another way in with more exploring.,HiTMAN,d2jz8u0,1,t5_2rn0x
7407573,0,t3_4gp6ho,I went exploring!  I turned off the Opportunities so I could just wander the map without anything telling me what to do.I found the Bohemian apartment took the joint and the hippie outfit of course.  Then I stumbled across the therapist so I followed him around until it became clear he was just hanging out at the ice cream shop.  So then I went around back of the ice cream shop and saw an ice cream waiter on a smoke break so I followed him back inside the basement of the ice cream shop and knocked him out and took his clothes.  I hid his body and went upstairs and found some rat poison which I put in the therapists coffee when he walked away.  I knocked out the therapist when he went to puke and entered the villa as the Doctor.  In Carusos room alone I found the biolab keycard and then sat down to begin the therapy.When Caruso confessed to smothering his mother I returned the favor then hid his body in the bin in the closet.  Then I took advantage of the Doctor disguise to wander the mansion.  I found a pack of cigarettes and put the joint inside it. A short while later De Silva came and smoked it.  I quickly ran to her office and beat her into the bathroom hid in the bin and then drowned her.  Then I overflowed the sink and took out her Alert bodyguard when he came to investigate.  Hid him and then set about trying to find the lab.Wandered around for a while always trying to go down until I found my way into a tunnel that spat me out near the church.  I worked my way into the church basement and found the Priest costume and when I came back up the real Priest was walking around so to avoid him I picked the lock on what turned out to be the morgue building.  I took the lab coat off the corpse and headed back out once the coast was clear.  I headed out around the outside of the cliff because I hadnt been that way yet and saw a guard waiting by a door in the cliffside.  If he hadnt been there Id have missed the surveillance cam.  I threw a coin and when he went to take a look I shot out the camera and swiped my keycard.  I went down dodged all the Alert scientists and made my way into the containment lab.  I poisoned the rats and then sabotaged the computer to distract the two scientists. When they were occupied I boiled the virus and stole the airplane.Jumped to Mastery Level  after one run.,HiTMAN,d2k6y7j,1,t5_2rn0x

Blew the fuse box out stole the lab technicians uniform then snuck my way to a hazmat suit and destroyed the virus right infront of everyone.People got alerted I ran out and found a guard on his own garroted him and stole his uniform hid him in a box and then ran out and back to the mansion front via the town and escaped in a car.,HiTMAN,d2kgjis,1,t5_2rn0x

7567180,0,t3_4iz30p,Hmmmmm. Francesca trying to steal the virus by forcing her to doublecross Silvio would have been interesting. Tries to escape by the plane or boat and then you cannon it and take out two for one. From what I vaguely remember of the story between the two I seem to think that Francesca didnt trust Silvio and needed evidence to back it up. I feel like they could have fleshed this out a little by having you feed her false evidence after meeting her whilst disguised as the detective. You can give her the DNA sample from the safe but she doesnt really do anything. She simply says she needs more time to figure things out but the suggestion is that she would assassinate Silvio herself using the virus and make it look like suicide.

The other use I was discussing this with made that very point and its very true. You dont want to wait  minutes for something to do thats not enjoyable Since you followed him a lot more than I did did his path become a relatively circular ordeal post drink?

So IMO the bonus episodes feel like a thank you from IO for putting our trust in them.Where I agree with you is that they should have made the full experience package a timed offer when the game initially released. Its really unfair for people who paid per episode when you could have simply waited for more episodes to be released and pay for the full experience then. The full experience now should be the same price as what episodic buyers will be paying in total.,HiTMAN,d9qbqfv,1,t5_2rn0x

Then bring up your inventory highlight the remaining breaching charge and press Drop Item triangle on PS. The charge will drop and you wont be carrying anything suspicious if you didnt drop the first one youll now instantly be spotted by the guard!                                            Let the guard pick up the charge and take it away you might have to leave the cubicle if he saw you drop it. If you stay youll be arrested.                                                                               Youre now alone with the target. I threw a coin close to the railing waited for him to pick it up and stabbed him with a syringe. You have to get lucky on this part. Some waitersguests walk up and down the stairs and might spot you so watch out before trying this. If you do get spotted restart the challenge before the poison does his work.                                                  Exit however you see fit. Watch out for enforcers and cameras in the restaurant though. I went back to the staircase leading up to s suite went down through the storage area and left the hotel through the side entrance and ran to the boat.

10145417,0,t3_5l793z,This is a interesting idea but id much rather see a gamemode where  players defend a npc and the evidence for bonus points from  players that are tasked with eliminating that target. The players defending the target get access to cameras and masterkeys the players that are tasked with killing the target have access to disguises and pretty much what  has available to him. I think this gamemode brings in fun cooperative gameplay while still staying true to the Hitman formula while not alienating fans.,HiTMAN,dbty9by,1,t5_2rn0x

I failed after four hours of trying to get my SA run done ended up having an NPC which Id never encountered before walk in on me after Id finally managed to isolate and kill the target. The only SA solutions to this contract either are predicated on basically cheating fire extinguisher kills or on ungodly amounts of cheese incapping every member of the kitchen staff to isolate before killing him. In the latter case you have to wait around  minutes during each run for your opportunity to manifest.Awful. Absolutely awful.

Unlike a map such as Hokkaido where obtaining the director outfit is a guaranteed win as he has access to almost the whole facility Sapienzas outfits are more specific to certain locations.For instance Lafayette and the Butler though powerful will only give you access to the villa. This makes eliminating both human targets easy but not the virus.Biolab security provides access to the underground lab and the bottom floors of the villa which lets you eliminate the virus and Caruso but not De SantisSapienza along with Colorado are maps that dont really have a Skeleton Key disguise.Also Abel is only really good for killing Cross whilst the exterminator can easily kill both men.,HiTMAN,dfa6skk,5,t5_2rn0x

Then go hitman c sa contracts bm and absolution.  His first mission is in Palais de Walevska in Paris where he has to kill Viktor Novikov and Dalia Margolis I dont know a lot about them.   now has a mission in Vernazza Cinque Terre. He has to kill Silvio Caruso Silvio works for Ether and wants to make a virus to kill the entire world if I got it right. Ether saw him as a threat and send your nd target Francesca De Santis to spy on him they say to help him but its revealed she has to spy on him. She loves one person  Roberto Vargas. Ether think he is a distraction but Francesca doesnt agree. We find out Silvio wants to kill Francesca he has her DNA people who bullied him including Marco Abiatti.  His next mission is in Morocco Marrakesh. He has to kill Claus Stranberg who if I understood it right stole  billion dollars. There are riots in front of his building. He has an interview with some news network which would add fuel to the fire and he even tries to make people more angry and do something. He wants them to do something illegal so that your nd target Reza Zaydan can use their martial law and kill everyone in the riot and extract Claus to Argentina and that way create a civil war in Morocco. Its not even his first time.  His next mission is in Thailand Bangkok where he has to kill Jordan Cross who killed his girlfriend Hannah Highmoore. Your clients are Highmoores. He has a death tape of him killing her and he gave them to Dexy Barat his manager. Thomas Cross his father and owner of Himappan Hotel sent his lawyer Ken Morgan to buy that tape from Dexy without Jordans privilege. Apparently she wants to double the money so if she doesnt agree she would be killed it would be faked to be a heart attack bc Ken is a fixer too. Reason she wants to double the price is bc after Jordan kills Hannah he called Dexy and if police found out she would be arrested.  At the ending cutscene  and his partnerhandler Diana realize that their last few missions are specifically designed to damage and hinder a secret society we know very little about. They are some secret illuminatilike group. They are called Providence. Next mission in USA Colorado  has to kill Penelope Graves Maya Parvati Sean Rose and Ezra Berg. I wont describe their entire fing life because its long. That mission is designed to attack Shadow Client. They thought Rose was shadow client but hes not. They find out that shadow client was tracking him for years Alvaro DAlvade Hayamoto Beldingford but all these missions are either unsolved or accidents. They find out that Soders gives Providence intel. They left and Shadow Client was talking something about his warden waking them up killing everyone telling him something and leaving.

11652625,0,t1_dggp2wj,Its only a puzzle game because its been computationally unrealistic to make anything else and also adds extra difficulty for players if AI was more realistic and had random movements. The game is designed more for SA style play which you have as many immersion breaking experiences but its still a puzzle type game. Computational resources may allow for radiant AI now maybe but players might get pissed off for the difficulty. I think a balance could be made assuming coding random behavior in these large levels wont cause lag issues and such. But there are simple things that dont need to be done to make the game artificially harder in pro. A screwdriver is just not suspicious. I could have just found it in the middle of a floor and wanted to move it. I may legitimately needed it for something.We want to feel like a hitman and it does bother me that I can memorize routines after multiple plays.
