3823,0,t3_1u5loe,Ive been using a Tp for a month now and while it is a great laptop the trackpad is simply terrible. No physical button instead youve got the whole trackpad pressing down and usually moving your mouse cursor at the same time. I still havent managed to figure out how the trackpad chooses to do a left click or a right click when I press it down it just seems random to me. And of course since you dont have physical buttons at the top of the trackpad the trackpoint is completely unusable and is relegated to being a constant reminder of how bad the new Lenovo trackpads are.,thinkpad,ceevfl3,2,t5_2qvhj

187006,0,t1_cezq7kh,gt You wanted to make an argument of people not understanding size vs resolutionNo. No I didnt. Not at all. Where the fuck did you get that? Because it wasnt in anything I wrote. Again you fail to comprehend.gt Wtf does that even mean? All IPS displays are LED back lit and suffer Backlight bleeding as based on the technology. Unlike the upcoming SHARP igzo panels into the market.All IPS displays are not LED backlit and CCFL backlighting generally has more uniform light distribution throughout the panel. So thats what I was talking about. This is old news.gt Well you really did pick a very bad example. Currently in the  market there is only  option. And that is IPS panels. You asked me if I thought  p was a bad idea I said not if you have a use for it. I elaborated that it might be a bad idea if someone has a  p or other size IPS display when end to end input lag is a more important consideration for them. IPS displays switch slower than TN again old news nothing to really debate here. The entire problem is your lack of reading comprehension and the assumptions you are making about my statements.I am not talking about most of the shit youve said so its you who needs to go back and reread my posts preferably several times and read a few books while youre at it to brush up on your comprehension in general.Nothing in my posts is really controversial or debatable it was all very innocuous basic shit so the fact that youve taken up arms against me for some reason is really fucking weird to me and your hostility was evident beginning with your first post. I gave you a couple of freebie replies then I called you out on being retarded after you tried to say I was being inconsistent because by that point it was clear you werent even reading what I was saying.Thats the recap.

278864,0,t3_1xa12f,If you wanna stay with a Thinkpad stay gt  screen size and want USB . ports support from the chipset not addon cards then Id look at the W or TT which according to their specsheets are the first in their respective product lines to feature native USB . support.Having owned a T T R Xt Xt X X X W and soon a W I will say that in my opinion the T and X felt by far the sturdiest and solidlyconstructed but thats not to say everything else had completely crap construction. Most of my issues with the others have been little bits of plastic chipping off here and there. Its annoying and maybe a bit indicative of build quality slipping since the Lenovo acquisition yeah but Im still far more confident with my Thinkpads than with most other laptops Ive dealt with.Servicing them has always been a pretty easy ordeal for me. The manufacturer freely makes the manuals available and theres an abundance of parts on ebay. You dont have to do stupid things like remove the motherboard to swap out of a hard drive either the internal layout is generally very clean.Note that youre screwed for nearly all available avenues if you wanna keep the  aspect ratio.,thinkpad,cf9o0ja,1,t5_2qvhj

Of course there are illegitimate activation methods that circumvent this very basic check but I think Microsoft has an online tool that can check for you. Either that or I guess you can phone them up. If its got a Microsoft product key sticker on it then you can use that. They should be able to tell you whether the key on the sticker has been activated or not.I probably should amend my statement to say check OS legitimacy regardless.

With that said the  or so Thinkpads Ive used dont come anywhere near what Lenovo says they should. Im typing this on my Tp which is rated for up to  hours with my config. Im fully charged with a balanced profile and brightness all the way down doing nothing but surfing reddit and Im at  hours  minutes left. Im pretty sure Lenovos tests are run on full power saving screen and wifi off or something with the times they estimate.I will admit that I am wrong though as it looks like some Thinkpads can match or even beatthe Air. The Ts looks like it can beat the Macbook if you get the massive battery option. Id just love to see better battery life improvement on Windows though as that Ts has almost twice the watt hours rating and still only squeaks out a couple more hours than the Mac. I still think Thinkpads are the way to go though. I just wish that one thing could be improved more but its not Lenovos fault.

3791639,0,t1_cqn2k0b,After following the instructions at  and googling a couple of the error messages that showed up when compiling I have xSwipe working. Though its not perfect as far as how accurately it detects gestures and it sometimes detects a two finger right click right at the end of a three or fourfinger gesture which is annoying. Installing the older patched synaptics driver seems to have caused my touchpads edges to stop working properly. I cant start a movement from the edges of the pad anymore though if I start elsewhere and continue into the edges it works fine. I cant seem to fix this with any trivial changes to the trackpad dimensions using synclient.Apparently running xSwipe also drains battery life a bit faster unless you decrease its polling interval in which case it works much less accurately. A shame  the touchpads accuracy sensitivity and support for clear gestures are really the only thing I miss after switching from a Macbook Pro. I do like the trackpoint minus the annoying occasional drift that apparently cant be fixed so overall things up end even from a mouse input perspective but still. Hopefully at some point the drivers will improve for this thing. ,thinkpad,cqoh6u3,1,t5_2qvhj

I program mostly in C and C and it is really convenient to have a native Linux environment instead of relying on software such as PuTTy to connect to the universitys cluster via ssh. Although the laptop will never be as good as the cluster in terms of computing power the lack of input lag while coding is something that I truly value although you can make the argument that you can have a native environment through a VM on Windows or some other program.To be honest I see a lot of physics majors with Macbook Pros a lot of my professors use them as well. However I dont really like OS X as it feels very limiting. However I cannot deny that the rMBP has really good specs and it definitely should be a top contender of the list of laptops that you may buy. If you are curious the reasons why I picked the Ts over the rMBP is because It was a lot cheaper used a really good discount deal I can upgrade the HDD to an SSD and RAM in a much more accessible fashion The keyboard of this machine is fantastic. I cannot emphasize how important the keyboard is to me especially if youre going to be doing a lot of coding which is pretty much all physics research these days Linux support on ThinkPads is really good On a somewhat related note the documentation of Arch Linux is fantasticI am obviously very biased towards my Ts and I dont really have that much experience with Macbook Pros.

4243232,0,t3_38zj8o,Alright so Ive learned a lot over the last few days. Im not sure how much of this is UEFI normal or Thinkpad specificIncorrect bootloader nameWhen booting a hard disk using UEFI only the bootloader in EFIBOOTBOOTX.efi will actually run. So if your bootloader is EFIREFITREFITX.EFI youll fail to find any bootloader.Normally when you install a distro it will stick its own bootloader in. For example Fedora installs grub as EFIfedoragrubx.efi. But it then uses efibootmgr to register this bootloader specifically. So pressing F at boot will give you the UEFIBIOS boot selector with entries for your Hard Disk USB drives and Fedora which is that specific bootloader.So if you move a hard disk to a new computer and it doesnt boot check the bootloaders name. You might need to cp it to boot at least until youve renamed it. Also fat is casepreserving but case insensitive. So upper or lower case are equivalent.T wont boot efistub kernelsSo now that Ive got grub and refind loading correctly I still havent got my system booting.Basically there are multiple parts of the boot process before the kernel and actually start doing any work Boot selection which OSkerneloptions and boot loading loading the kernel amp initramfs from disk etc.Traditionally most bootloaders did both. However on UEFI the kernel is capable of acting as its own bootloader via efistub support which is to say it can receive a command line and fetch its own initramfs. Since then it seems that pretty much every UEFI boot loader is only doing the selection part and letting the kernel do its own business. This works fine on my W but doesnt on my T. I still have not figured out why.During the troubleshooting which involved blowing away all of grub including in boot and bootefi reinstalling grubmkconfiging Ive managed to progress from Hang when booting to Immediate reboot when booting. YAY!.Thanks to JordanU in Fedora on Freenode I found out about pstore which is basically nvram that will contain kernel crash logs. Unfortunately it is empty. Fedora  amp  boot media also fails to boot on the T. So I dont think this is exclusively something Ive messed up but some sort of FedoraT conflict.Of interest and my only road for further investigation Ubuntu boots fine and also uses grub.I grabbed Ubuntus kernel initramfs and modules directory and stuck them in my Fedora system. It fails to boot. This is expected since the whole init configuration would be invalid it wouldnt understand my LUKS disks etc. However I expected to see an error. Instead I just get similar hang or reboot like with the Fedora kernels...T wont boot MBR bootloaders from a GPT diskI started to install grubmbr and went as far as doing partition voodoo to create a biosgrub partition on my GPT disk. However it turns out there is apparently a bug in the T or maybe thinkpad in general firmware. It wont boot an MBR bootloader from a GPT disk regardless of how correctly it is configured. Lost a day trying to get this to work...Temporarily working systemIve grabbed a copy of Syslinux which appears to be the only UEFIbased bootloader that doesnt just use efistub. It can only read the EFI system partition so I had to cp my kernel and initramfs to the syslinux directory.Im able to boot sucessfully but it will require manual steps when upgrading kernels. Additionally I dont have access to UEFI variables at runtime efibootmgr. It gets me going for now though.,thinkpad,cs3x3oz,2,t5_2qvhj

Wholly different technology and vastly inferior. IBM once produced a Model M variant with a real trackpoint. Needless to say those are harder to find than a mint condition Wds because nobody is insane enough to voluntarily give one away. Lenovos current external keyboards are like the  series internal keyboards. Shitty new layout yes but the actual key mechanic is at least as good as in the old boards. If you can live with the layout changes theyre a breeze to type on. The Lenovo Ultranavs with touchpad seem to be out of production and overpriced residual stock. Meh. Ive never found one cheap enough to justify buying one. But as far as I know you can disable the touchpad just like on internal keyboards. If you find one for a decent price why not? IBM is still producing UltraNav keyboards for their servers. Those come without WindowsMenu keys wont need either on a Power server and without touchpad but are otherwise full row keyboards personally Id just remap Caps Lock to Windows and AltGrCaps for menu  Im doing that on my preWindows Model M and cant complain about the keys accessibility.Edit Oh yeah. Lenovo also did nontouchpad Ultranavs with the semiclassical  series layout. Personally I hated that one must be why I repressed the memories until urednight brought it up. The wrist rest is awkward and it feels really flimsy and hollow  the thin cheap case makes for a very unthinkpadly bouncy keyboard experience.

Back then there were no multi finger gestures so when I saw someone do a middle click scroll it really appealed to me.But yea the screen wasnt as bright or as vibrant in colors.  Still I managed to play games and watch videos.  But I wouldnt retouch photos on one.  My current x IPS is much better in that respect but the resolution is much lower.I dont know why Lenovo is so stingy with screens.  Even a then  Acer netbook had a higher DPI and brightness and contrast screen.The speakers were never the loudest.  My T had decent volume mostly because the speakers pointed straight up.  Most other models have the speakers pointed down to bounce off a desk.  Having one on your lap will greatly affect it.You also have to deal with the OS.  There are hacks to increase the volume.  In many instances my volume would at some point only go up to  indicated versus  that I seemed to remember.  So software issues were to blame sometimes.That can happen when one company doesnt control the hardware and the OS the way Apple does.But I have an iPhone and hate it.  Hate the fact that I have to install Apache on my laptop to download PDF magazines and home videos to the phone.  Hate the fact that getting pictures off the phone is such a task.  Hate the fact that everyone just seems to accept the fact that they have to use some sort of a cloud solution.  Apple just gets in the way of you using their hardware.  They want to tell you how you should use it.Ive historically stayed with ThinkPads because of the better to me hardware things like TrackPoint  screen great resolution for text and SSH and the fact that Apples old non laptops were a bit of a joke.But thats changed with retina displays and unibody aluminum construction even on the  models.

6295893,0,t3_41up91,gtIm looking at getting a new laptop and have been looking at getting the ThinkPad Ts but have a few questions. Does all the ThinkPad settingsdrivers work on Windows  Bluetooth hotkeys etc Does it support the laptop splash screen When it shows the Lenovo logo on start up instead of the windows logo And what is the battery life like with the system and has anyone upgraded the wifi to an ac wireless card? I love my Ts! Ive run Linux Mint in it for majority of its life but had a brief stint on Win and everything worked for me. Honestly not sure if I tested every external hardware buttonswitch but everything I use worked as did the internal hardware drivers for bluetooth and such. Also know the Windows license that is embedded in the bios works flawlessly with Win activation. Not quite sure about the splash screen you speak of.Battery life was solid I have the ultra bay battery as well but I know my batteries are now around  capacity due to age. Havent upgraded the wifi card as I havent had a need at home or work but I may one day! Other mods I did or am doing broke down computer and replaced thermal paste with some good stuff gelid  I was able to acquire the display adapter made by nb ThinkPad forum just waiting until next month to buy the HD screen. Suuuper excited for this. Other notes I think the Tx gen doesnt get enough love. It was the first to get the chiclet keyboard so the gen received a lot of hate initially you know how we love our keyboards!. So people generally advise the Tx gen if buying used. However I think weve all accepted the chiclet keyboard unless were talking retro ThinkPad project and I actually find it a joy to type on. Its not my mechanical keyboard but the action feels better than any other laptop chiclet keyboard Ive tried. Tx prices are also dropping low enough that the Tx isnt that much of a savings. In addition you have physical track pad buttons which marred the Tx gen. Tx did GREATLY improve the screens but with nbs work my Ts has the best of everything newer architecture than Tx HD screen from Tx and physical track point buttons. TLDR the Ts is my favorite laptop to date and Id recommend it as my top suggestion for a used ThinkPad. ,thinkpad,cz59shl,3,t5_2qvhj

The miniPCIe slots dont have the sata line running to them that those drives need luckily for you theres an mSATA slot on the mobo.There are two miniPCIe slots and an mSATA slot on the mobo. Theyre all identical in terms of form factor but differ in the the aforementioned sata line to the msata port. In other words you can just add an mSATA ssd and keep your WWAN card and . drive in place.

The T is pretty much all glass fibre with a magnesium roll cage and plastic palm rest. If durability is important to you i think the T would likely outlast the S model as it is thicker and glass fiber doesnt crack with impacts. Please note however that both laptops are nevertheless MILSPEC certified.Finally I really dont think there is a consensus as to which machine is better.

7035488,0,t3_4byt2y,If you want more screen real estate and can deal with the smaller font size I get roughly  lines vertically then you might want the K screen. Otherwise the FHD may be better. Longer versionI think the P display range is actually kind of lacking Why is there not a K option on this top of the line device? Personally I find the k display to be a bit limiting I can use it at native res with  scaling but I find it a bit small sometimes I think a k display would be nicer in general.Part of the issue is Windows scaling so Linux users might not have the same level of annoyance or people who dont fight with external displays or maybe it is just me but changing the scaling factor messes things up too much that I find it easier to fake out a x resolution and use that instead of full k all the time.Hopefully theyll add a K option for people who want the middle ground. ,thinkpad,d1dtubh,2,t5_2qvhj

8031065,0,t1_d4iqotv,Old school reasoning was if it aint broke dont fix it but honestly times have changed. Most of the hardware and software is released with all sorts of bugs quirks and vulnerabilities that updates are an important part of staying secure and running as efficiently as possible. The rule of thumb is give something as serious as a firmware or BIOS flash a few days after release to let any major problems get ironed out....Never hurts to wait  hours to make sure. Then just update. I rarely if ever encounter problems after updating. Usually the reverse is opposite performance improves new features are added random glitches or weird events go away battery life improves etc. Example the most recent BIOS out yesterday for the x and other laptops with power bridge dual batteries apparently fixed an issue some people experienced with the internal battery discharging before the external which is the reverse of the intended function. There have been quite a few threads posted by people with that problem. They have every reason to want to update to this bios.Video drivers are another thing especially with a new generation machine. Intel is still tidying up and refining the graphics drivers for their Skylake chips. Early versions of those drivers had all sorts of problems.

STORAGEYour laptop will likely come with only one drive in the SATA slot where Windows will be installed. Your laptop also has a mSATA slot that is probably empty.Your operating system can live on either drive. The SATA slot is faster than the mSATA slot I am pretty sure if that matters to you. In my configuration I left Windows on the SATA hdd and installed a mSATA drive to house Linux. I use this laptop infrequently and for light work so I did not want to spend much on drives. I am happy with the performance.  As a PS user you should have best practises in organizing your drives. My configuration .in SATA   OEM GB hdd Win pro mSATA  GB MydigitalSSD here LinuxIn your case you can buy a similar mSATA SSD in sizes up to GB.  The .in SATA slot can take hdd or .in SSDs. The latter go up to TB. The sizes of both will depend on your needs and how you manage your storage. Of course budget an external drive to backup your important images.  MEMORYAs to memory your laptop unofficially supports xGB modules. I would wait to see how PS and LR run in the ram it comes with before buying more ram but I think GB would be the minimum acceptable in your use case. Search rthinkpad for ram suggestions as Ive never upgraded my xGB modules. The only other upgrade I can think of is buying an IPS panel to replace your TN panel if that is what you get.

8467598,0,t1_d5ztyk4,Not a real workaround I guess you have to unlock the socket by inserting something in the ground upper singular cutout that will lift away the plastic covers off the other  cutouts for live and neutral and then position the power lead matching the  holes and push it in since the distance between the  tips is a bit smaller but so small that it easily bents in a non damaging way and enters the socket and the circuit starts working. And then remove the object you used to unlock the ground. Preferably it should be a non metallic object just to be safe the same way you handle the car battery with just a hand and the other behind your back. The voltage is the same as in whole Europe V Hz. Beware though not to have the network overloaded by some device as electrical circuitry in UK households has been made in such a way that it does not have a central safe box as is usual in most continental European countries that disables the circuit once a certain current has been reached but instead each UK plug is usually fitted with a fuse that provides the same functionality locally. This network design has been chosen for cost saving as far as I know as the electricity spread in the UK happened at a time of increased copper prices. For you not having the fuse in the Type C plug there may be a slight risk but newer homes are built to the now standard radial I think it is called circuit. Oh and yeah no matter what avoid touching the live hole and either of the  other holes at the same time or the live hole and some other object that has the same potential as either of the other holes. Avoid touching the holes altogether especially the live one. At the voltages encountered by touching I mean using either your skin or your skin via some other metallic object. If we were to talk about lightning touching would literally happen through anything no matter the material. Good luck!,thinkpad,d5zzl9f,2,t5_2qvhj

I think this is mainly due to Microsoft who has to take the burden of distributing Gb packages to billions of people through their server. For preinstalled Windows on OEM computers I guess manufacturers are not in a hurry to use the latest version of OS. Because things may break up due to compatibility issues of new release.

If its on a desk and the extra heat is not directly affecting you you can for example keep the fan humming at lowest revs at up to C then kick in fullforce to relieve the excessive heat until it goes back down to C then again spin down to lowest revs. Tweaking tpfancontrol is an ongoing process as you tailor it to the quirks of your particular thinkpad.When its in your lap you can switch tpfanco to a second cooler and noisier profile.A Ts by the way would be quite cooler.

If youre using generic drivers you should be able to move the drive to and from mostany nonRAID controllers but if youre using controller specific drivers they have to be compatible with both controllers to work. Going from something like ICH to ICH or similar  generation leap from the same chip provider has a high chance of working while going cross provider is more likely to fail.

9774998,0,t1_dahtj3y,Go for the i and Nvidia GPU. The speed difference between the i and i models is pretty significant unlike the  watt i and i models. The Nvidia MX GPU isnt all that powerful but it does help when you need to take some load off of the CPUIntel graphics in certain applications. Its not a waste unless you expect the Tp to be a top of the line gaming laptop which its not designed to be. But keep in mind Intel integrated graphics have gotten much better over the past few generations. When you add RAM go ahead and max it out at  GB. Im also running a  GB SSD in mine. Combine all that with an i CPU and it makes for a pretty decent mobile VMware lab. IIRC the P and P can take up to  GB of RAM so they would be even better suited for this purpose.The one thing that really bugs me about the Tp is the difficulty in performing hardware upgrades. What I mean is that instead of having access panels for the RAM and HDD bays the entire bottom panel has to come off and you have to carefully pry it apart from the palm rest. My palm rest has a very small hairline crack over the smart card reader due to this but a dab of Krazy Glue has held it together for several months now. Its easier to have access to the entire motherboard this way but more difficult to perform some standard upgrades. I would not want to have to manage a fleet of these in a business environment. ,thinkpad,dahzgld,3,t5_2qvhj

The T would be a close second if it werent for the fucking latches...Historically?  Eh... depends on whether were talking about a historical model in comparison to all other ThinkPads ever or just compared to its contemporaries.   T was great compared to its contemporaries but kinda crap compared to modern designs.  Its heavy got a ton of parts and the engineering tradeoffs it made for strength probably wouldnt have been necessary if a new design were used instead of what was basically just T.   was well built for the time but primitive in materials compared to todays ThinkPads not the s fault just that material science has moved on and the longevity of certain parts of the design leaves something to be desired ever wonder why we dont bond perfectly flat surfaces to other perfectlyflat coated surfaces?  cause it doesnt last.  Thats why the s frequently shed their port covers.But really Id have to ask for more clarification on well built.

9878307,0,t1_dav2zu3,I hear you. The dell is actually used only here and there mainly for email and pushing out official PR etc and Im only using the monitor on it. I only have the keyboard out when Im doing that. Normally the keyboard is in the drawer and Im sitting directly in front of the x and using its own keyboard and the monitor to the right. My chair height is raised and the second monitor is mainly for holding a document Im referring to and the bulk of what Im actually working on is on the laptop screen. The Dell when Im not using it is just a Tweetdeck screen mainly and I dont need to do any input.I do agree that I could tweak this a bit. I havent quite settled on my preferred setup. I think moving the Dell to be vertical on its side might make sense. Im also contemplating putting the right side monitor on a stand to raise it up a little bit so the xs screen isnt blocking the lower left corner. I probably should use the Mech. keyboard with the ThinkPad but then Id have to use the dreadful Dell keyboard with the Optiplex and would either have to use the Unicomp right in front of the x ugh or keep the Dell keyboard on the desk somewhere and it would be awkward and clunky.

10803586,0,t1_ddu51uw,I bought a T with an NVS m in  and still use it as a main machine because I have some older games I thought Id play. UserBenchmark while not the last word on GPU performance says the NVS is only  better than the HD iGPU. The same website says the M is only about  better than the HD. At least Lenovo is consistent. When I started to get back into gaming I tended to buy games that could either work on the HD iGPU or needed something beefier than the dGPU to run at higher settings with  FPS. Low settings work ok for such titles and my older games tend to either have issues with Win or run great on the HD. If I had to do it all over again I may have saved money by skipping the dGPU making my laptop more linuxfriendly and bought an eGPU or gaming desktop later. Maybe I would have maxed out the processor to avoid CPU bottlenecks with said eGPU. That plan would have required some foresight I wasnt aware eGPUs would develop as they did or that Linux Optimus support would stagnate. YMMV but examining benchmarks for both the HD and M in the games you like to play may provide insight. And its difficult to predict what the future will bring.TLDR If you have a gaming desktop already a dGPU in a laptop may not be important when the disparity in performance is so small.Edit clarity,thinkpad,ddubb0p,2,t5_2qvhj

10986032,0,t1_ded17h8,This.  As an operating system Linux tends to idle at a lower CPU use out of box and this can be reduced further by easily stopping useless services or for example turning off display compositing and heavier UI support services.  Since Im running Xfce the X in Xubuntu it is a much lighterweight desktop environment and both boots and runs snappier than Windows without going as barebones as LXDE.HOWEVER the issue for the benefit of ufleamour is that less resources are invested into drivers and apps for the Linux platform. Manufacturers do not put the same level of effort into tuning drivers if they do release them.  Stock linux driver support has gone from meh to excellent in the last few years but that little bit of efficiency for ACPI power management and graphics power management does make a difference.  Also crossplatform software is generally not as well optimized and this often means making less use of driver and hardware features such as GPU acceleration plus people coding with knowledge of which system calls and libraries give the best results.Microsoft meanwhile has put a lot of effort into stripping down their OS to run more efficiently and better tune for hardware use.  The end result is a bit of a wash for performance and power efficiency.  For server applications and coding linux has an edge for consumer applications it is generally OS X or Microsoft.  I far prefer the XFCE environment over anything Microsoft or Apple can throw together and you can take my terminal with bash from my Cold.  Dead.  Fingers.  But Linux as always more efficient?  Nope.Worth mentioning to put my credentials out there RHCSA and one of the linux package maintainers for a large and popular open source software project.

The T is a  model and is starting to get a little old. Thr T comes with a newer island keyboard and USB .. You can buy a T for about  more than a T. Both have excellent Linux support. Youll have to do a little searching if you want the fingerprint reader to work and youll have to get an app to adjust the TrackPad sensitivity trust me  youll want to do this. Otherwise everything works OOTB.If you want newer skip the  models T and fork over the extra cash for a T or T including the S variation.

Try turning off Hardware Acceleration in the advanced settings.  Which WiFi card do you have?  What does your CPU and iGPU or dGPU usage look like?I currently use a Core iQM which is a W QM and get upwards of  hours while mobile with my config watching Twitch over WiFi Source Q  brightness  volume backlit kb on high CPU locked at .GHz and HT Enabled.  Thats with a  Cell Main battery but theres also the triple drive setup x SSDs and x HDD overclocked RAM and HD panel so its power hungry.In a prior config using a Core iM GB xGB DDRMHz  WiFi card single SSD GB . and HD panel I could get  hours watching Twitch.

11750386,0,t3_67o5rb,If you really want to try first soak it in a bath of warm DEMINERALISED water several times. Its the minerals in the water that screws up the electrical circuits. Be sure to clean all the contacts in the CPU when you take it out and renew the paste. Also remove and clean all the items that plug in.Clean everything in demineralised water.  Dry everything after blowing out all the orifices with compressed air.After all this reassemble with care after using some contact cleaner spray on everything that plugs in.Its pretty labor intensive just to find out why it was tossed into a watery grave in the first place.I once sold the water based cleaner solutions for manufacturing process in building electronic circuit boards.

11775272,0,t3_680hha,Thats actually pretty impressive  a lot of the laptops will refuse to charge on anything under W.Edit worth mentioning that the T should pull ltW on light load under battery but can pull significantly more when under heavier load or running on AC with power conservation features off.  So it makes sense for it to not detect as under AC but can actually run off a smartphone charger most of the time  rather impressive!The only caveat is that it will probably dip into tapping the battery to supplement the charger input and may be tricklechargingtrickledischarging which is bad for battery life.,thinkpad,dgurgk5,2,t5_2qvhj

11785589,0,t3_684iwj,So if were honest the screen and touchpad on the XT arent great. The best you can really say about them is that theyre serviceableuseable. The general consensus here is to use the TrackPoint mainly instead. That said for the price point youre probably not going to find much better at least for the screen the power and durability are hard if not impossible to beat at the price too.Battery life wise personally Ive never really been satisfied with the life of my X.    hours max on my cell although Id expect the X to be slightly better. The cell would be sufficient for me but I found it hard to justify buying a brand new cell since its so expensive relative to the cost of the machine. If youre buying from an online auction site i.e. eBay I would suggest watching auctions for a week or two and maybe looking at the xx series as well if youre okay with the buttonless touchpad  in my opinion its better as a touchpad than the XT but handicaps the TrackPoint. You might find a good deal. bidvoy.net has price tracking for eBay.de,thinkpad,dgvxov9,1,t5_2qvhj
