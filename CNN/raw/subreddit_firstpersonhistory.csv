3294596,0,t1_cp3ss25,This was a brilliant post i found the following quiet telling of how soldiers viewed the war on break.gtThe jump from camp life into frontline living is just as great as the original jump from civilian life into the Army. Only those who served in the last war can conceive of the makeshift deadly urgent alwaysmovingonward complexion of frontline existence. It provides a great personal experience and heck its brutal at points just as their reality was. My personal favourite text from WW is Tom Renoufs tales of the Blackwatch regiment st Highland division. It conveys the similarly intense yet scarily human view of the war. Edit The st highlanders upon their victory march at the end of the major conflicts.Your post also shows that sometimes the lessons we learn from war are the lessons from our soldiers. A battle is only as strong as the desire of the man taking point he is first through the door to see our victory or defeat at the moment he kicks that door that moment is everything to him,firstpersonhistory,cp3t6tg,2,t5_37486
