3223781,0,t3_2x0n4a,Im so sorry...thats a lot of loss in a short period of time.I think it can be true that it comes in waves.  My advice is not to try to follow any grieving timeline let yourself be sad.  Be around people who understand  see if there are support groups in your area.  Be kind to yourself.  Do things for your lost loved ones like put out photos or make an album wear something of theirs.  Decorate their graves if they have them.  You also might want to see a therapist or counselor who specializes in dealing with grief.Again Im so sorry.,Grieving,cow5co1,1,t5_2s624
4180107,0,t3_38mmaz,Oh my gosh what a horrible thing to happen.First thing you might have hit the cat. You might not have. Youll never know for sure which Im sure must be driving you mad. Its entirely possible she really was hit by another car. You checked and didnt see anything if you had run her over Im not sure she could have scurried off fast enough you wouldnt have seen her.Second pets are members of our families and their loss should not be considered less because theyre not humans. Its ok to grieve their passing I know I do.You gave Pounce a great life and Im sure she loved you very much. Im sure youll be replaying yesterday over in your mind for a quite a while but try not to forget all the times you had together before that. There is nothing you can do now but remember her. We are so lucky to have these furry little creatures in our lives.I wish I could give you a hug. Im so sorry for your loss.,Grieving,crwqio2,2,t5_2s624
5707993,0,t3_3taz69,This is nice and super relevant for me currently. Lost my brother a month ago. We were close. I work for a small start up marketing company in a sales position that requires me to reach out contact keep at people be jovial be forward and friendly and a real go getter. None of these things are coming easily. My boss needs me to get shit done but its just so difficult to find the energy and ability. Im trying but fuck if it isnt an uphill battle at this point. ,Grieving,cx4mrr6,2,t5_2s624
