11291,0,t1_cefpn00,I would definitely say for you to start practicing Brazilian JiuJitsu. It is my favorite thing in the world it honestly makes you a better person in terms of your ego you will learn some very viable selfdefense tools shit that actually works on the streetz not like selfdefense techniques taught by idiots who never fought professionally and if you stick with it you will have friends for life. I say it because BJJ is hard. Really really hard. I dont think theres any martial art or combat sport more difficult to master than BJJ. Thats why nowadays even in MMA people prefer to learn wrestling cause its easier for ground fighting than learning BJJ. But it can be a life changer for you. Just check if theres a gym near you and sign up for trial classclasses. I knew people who joined BJJ and it really motivated them and gave them something to strive for in their lives. You cant be depressed when youre rolling trying to choke someone out or breaking his arm  or getting choked outThe only downside is that BJJ any form of groundfighting actually is even more exhausting than Boxing or wtvr. It really burns a lot of calories. So youll have to eat even more xD but looking at your situation I think taking care of your mental state right now is more important than your body.Pls take  minutos to read this.Edit if you do go to BJJ dont get discouraged because youll see a lot of very fit and muscular guys. Thts because Im sure a lot of them fight in MMA and are also high BJJ and Grappling competitors. ,gainit,cefpxp7,1,t5_2s9bg

29276,0,t1_cehg5zg,I dont know what kind of qualification you have but that was horrible advice and this is a consistent trend that ive observed in  PT practice. I am an athlete and have been under an HMO for many years as well as a secondary insurer my point is that I have worked with the people who are just good enough to be in the field and people who are among the best in the field.I have had ankle knee and shoulder injuries and have spent a lot of time with health practitioners including orthopedists physical trainers PTs DPTs chiropractors acupuncturists pilates instructors and body workers.The best care I ever got was from the best chiropractor bodyworker and both DPTs and the common thread amongst these people was that they understood the body as a machine. Your response is typical to an inexperienced practitioner but more broadly PTs and that answer is to compartmentalize the issue while disregarding the numerous factors that could lie at the heart of the ailment. It makes me cringe to hear you say that a ton of rows will fix someones posture because it will strengthen postural muscles because that is such an unbelievably naive conclusion. Its frustrating because I was advised for a long time in this manner and it didnt get me anywhere and wasted a whole lot of my time. Graston on a calcium deposit squats and manual stimulation to relieve patellar tendinitis and highly regulated one legged declines and planks as a part of an ankle regiment...it just hurts my soul to know I wasted so much time doing this bullshit. So I suggest you take some anatomy and apply a more utilitarian and holistic approach to observing the body and making sure you dont give people crap advice that could really hurt them.I will enumerate my quips with your suggestion if youd like but I dont want to go to the trouble right now as its late and you might not care.  ,gainit,cehrk8j,0,t5_2s9bg

Also note that lactose sensitivity and intolerance usually develops in your late teensearly twenties.

770053,0,t1_cgrsewv,your post makes no sense....what is the problem... that he cant lift some arbitrary amount of weight? using dumbells isnt going to allow him to lift  pounds all of a sudden....thats not the point.As a begginer the primary focus should be form and avoiding injuries one of the best way to prevent injuries is to strengthen those less visible stabilizer muscles. In my experience those muscles will help more when something goes wrong in a lift than anything else which will inevitably happen over time. Now you may disagree with this and thats fine but thats simply my experience.Personally I dont know why people are so quick to use a barbell i dont see many benefits over dumbells and i think that what happened in the above example where new lifters jump too high in weight happens alot more when you are adding lb plates to the bar versus simply using lb dumbells.So idk why i have  downvotes id like to be corrected if something im saying is wrong but i see more benefit for a beginner to use dumbells than for a beginner to use a barbell.,gainit,cgrt5r1,1,t5_2s9bg

Does that apply too much pressure? You can also look into seated row machines. They have a cushion that presses into your chest which isolates your armsback so your lower back doesnt have to take any weight.

Fruit and veggie only is not healthy unless you take care to get enough protein and fat from vegetable sources and unless you are already aware of and doing this you are definitely not getting enough protein.

While your diet got you where you wanted to be ultimately its detrimental to your health and wholly unsustainable.Being  at  isnt extraordinarily skinny though its on the low end of normal so depending on your body type and composition it could be too much but feeling weak and looking sick is extraordinarily bad.  Continue to eat vegetables especially leafy greens because theyre great for you but also eat protein and fat.

In a K diet even if you eat a high protein amount say g thats only  x    calories. g is typical to find with that g so an extra  x    calories. So with a high proetin low fat you only gotten  calories which is barely half of your diet. Veggies has low calories so no real point in calculating them.      calories to fill. If all in carbs you are looking at g. However if you add g of healthy fats like olive oil then you get another  calories to subtract from  giving you  calories or g of carbs needed.

As for the starting weight its the same way you figure out weight for every other exercises. You spent a day doing increment of  lbs until you find the one that is challenging but not too hard to do. Can do perform with  reps but not  reps. Be careful with form and take time to master it. For example if you lift with imbalance one hand rise higher than another you will shift more weight toward that arms which will cause damage to wrist tendons and joints. The best starting position is with the bar held at your waist. You put weights on the bar which laying on the ground and lift it up like deadlift. At the top of that lift will be the starting position. You curl up and come down. Dont jerk. Do clean and smooth motion. Shoulders and legs shouldnt move. Dont let the bar drop immediately down control its decline. As you are coming down pop out your elbows. It contracts your triceps getting them a good workout too. As you mastered the form you can add wrist curls at the top and bottom of each lift to workout your forearms. ,gainit,cifa4m1,2,t5_2s9bg

1706837,0,t1_cju9h6y,gt its calories per day that matters most. Correct. Besides exercise this is the biggest factor in building muscle andor adipose fat tissue but there are many more important factors to health and nutrition besides basic caloric intake. There is a reason we put such a big emphasis on macronutrients but the micros are important to your health as well. I am also a firm believer in eating properly to fuel the fire to work out harder and become stronger faster. Similarly this is why I strongly believe in doing cardio while gaining as it does wonders for your energy levels you just have to eat a few hundred extra kcal per day to make up for it and it is totally easy to eat a few hundred kcal.Think of it this way  if you eat Chinese takeout you can hit your proteinfatcarb and calorie marks pretty handily feel exhausted all day and perform poorly during your workout.

2189692,0,t3_2k5fud,Thankfully youve got a year ahead of you friend. Do NOT drop track andor cardio. If I can give you  pieces of advice may it be these might I add I was  lbs  months ago now Im   BF Eat! Just force yourself! Ooo should I eat that last fajita? The answer is hells yes! It would help to keep track of your inout and focus on clearing  kcal day. With the incorporation of a simple shake every day you can easily have that surplus. SLEEP! I cannot stress this enough. Even by keeping a high intake diet and being very physically active if you dont get enough sleep it becomes insanely difficult to gain mass. This may not be the case with everyone but it was a HUGE factor for me. Work out. I understand youre very fit already and possibly work out but adopt a system. My schedule during the system was work out every other day. No exceptions. During the school year I altered it to Monday  upper body amp coreTuesday  Upper body back and core againWednesday  Leg day!Thursday  Upper body back and core..Friday  Rest!Saturday  Full bodySunday  Rest!To give some background I play soccer  times a week paintball one a week and the above weightlifting schedule. So I intake easily  kcals daily to maintain a surplus of in over out.For an insanely fast bulk I recommendPossibly GOMAD or a variation. During the school year GOMAD is difficult and can be expensive for students who dont have jobs or any sort of income or financial support. It is only  a day. You WILL get awful shits and acne however.Creatine. Creatine significantly increases the amount of water weight your body hold. gday is all I have and I put that in my preworkout every day I work out.With that being said drink a LOT of water. ESPECIALLY on GOMAD. Your kidneys have to a do LOT of filtering during this time and the higher amount of urine passing through will help with the cleansing process. That and water is essential for everything. Water is great! Love your water!Brotein shakes. Protein shakes will be your best friend. In a mL  L shake try to include mL milk or water but   . milk is optimal one of those small yogurt cup things or three generous tablespoons of greek yogurt handful of berries of your choice optional  or a full banana. Walnuts or almonds optional tsp of honey yumyum and of course your protein powder! Great thing to casually sip while on the computer or walking around or during classes. You can add your own fun things like flax or other types of seeds different nuts fruits peanut butter ice cream etc. The limits are endless and you can tailor them to your tastes.I know for a fact you can do all of this. Being in the military youll have a very strict regiment to follow and following your own routine will also build discipline which will help you adjust to your surroundings in the future ie the military. I know my advice isnt  good and some people will shoot it down. My sciences may be partially off but the general ideas are correct. If you have any questions about anything let me know!

You can just try it and as long as the meat is not pink it is fine. Then you can start adding veggies and more things in it.  Shakes. Find recipes for shakes. All you do is pour the ingredients into a blender and hit blend. Chicken breast Get an oven dish put them in the dish and add a few seasonings. Put in oven for  min or so. You can google oven chicken breast and finds recipes that give you times and temps. After that everything else is just fluff. Put hot sauce on after. Rice as you know is easy. Potato is another easy one. You can microwave a potato google it.  Salmon and fish. You buy some frozen or fresh. Put oil on pan place fish on pan and cook it. Youtube videos of people doing it and try it yourself.  If it is boxed foods and such they have directions on it. of what I learned from cooking was watching a youtube video of it then trying it myself or just looking at ingredients and times of a recipe then doing it myself. I make sure I dont make things complicated by following recipe point by point. I use my own liberties so everytime I make something its a bit different and I can play around to see what works better or not. Following a recipe is like using GPS.

That parts obvious.Whats less obvious is whether or not youll lose all the muscle youve gainedbtfcredit suggests youll actually retain some when eating and exercising at your original maintenance.Ive also read that although were advised to eat protein at a ratio of g per lb of bodyweight in order to bulk we can maintain at .g per kg Chances are that at lb youre already eating lbg of protein a day.The part about skinny genes is nonsense thoughif youre skinny right now its because youre not consuming enough calories to put on much fat you even describe yourself as a runner not because of genetics.

As for what lifts to start at better to start too low than too high your progression will catch up with your real strength if youre too low but if youre too high you will have poor form and stall. Given that you do physical activity I suspect you will be able to start with more than the bar. I know SS prescribes the first day I imagine SL does as well. Read its wiki carefully.

Mark has done a lot of good stuff for the fitness community with his simplistic nobullshit attitude but things get much deeper than that. Just like in school youre taught that youre forbidden to take a root of a negative number and later in calculus they give you the imaginary unit and suddenly you can do things that were not possible before  things also get much deeper than what Rippetoe says. But you just cant teach imaginary numbers to firstgraders. Hes stuff is marketed towards beginners. Once you go past the beginnertointermediate stage and still serious about fitness its important to diversify your sources read other books watch videos which specifically disagree with Rippetoe and make up your own mind. Even though SS is most likely the best training program for beginners Marks promise of heaps of muscle has been largely criticized as bullshit and unrealistic marketing.,gainit,cnug6bt,1,t5_2s9bg

2921697,0,t3_2tjyp1,  and  years old this month.I hadnt lifted regularly since I was . At  after getting sick and spending a short period of time in the hospital I dropped down to about lbs and had lost a lot of muscle mass and fat. In March of  I decided to make some changes and started lifting and changed my diet quite a bit gave up alcohol altogether.  I still have no appetite and an erratic schedule but Im getting better.  Mass gainers have helped a lot.  I went through about lbs of Muscle Juice Revolution . Now Im just using whey and milk but I ordered more gainer on myprotein.com yesterday. Here I am at the beginning lbs juxtaposed with a shot of me lbs heavier after about  months or soAfter about  monthsAfter about  months and a little more arm work  around lbsIm still not as consistent as I would like with my diet and I have probably skipped about a month and a half at the gym in total.  Depression hits me kind of hard and Ill have stretches of about  weeks without doing much of anything. Im back at it now though.This is the first time Ive posted pics online but I would like to do a transformation post at yr. Ive stalled out on lifts a couple times and there are a few young guys at my gym that have passed me with their youthful gains but I just have to stay focused on bettering myself and breaking through those plateaus when I hit them.  You may not bulk as quickly your recovery may take a bit longer and you may hurt a bit more the older you get but you are never too old to transform your body and your life in ways you didnt think were possible.  I wish I could turn back the clock but I cant. I have to live with the decisions Ive made in life and the toll they have taken on my body but Ive come to accept that now.  Honestly a year ago I wasnt quite sure I would be alive right now much less be in the physical and mental state I am in so Im still happy with my progress despite not looking like Arnold. Assuming you have no extreme medical conditions and normal T levels the gains will surely come.  Late s is by no means old on the spectrum of life.  With discipline and persistence in the gym and the right diet you can absolutely make an insane transformation at your age. ,gainit,co07f4c,5,t5_2s9bg

3162683,0,t3_2wc4xz,Your lifting numbers are close to intermediate so you probably could go straight into PHAT if you wanted just drop some of the accessory work when you start.  Of course that also suggests that you might be gifted when it comes to building strength so you might get a lot of mileage out of SL x.I would drop the weight down to a range where you can go through enough reps to get your form down right before you start hitting your RM for each session.  You dont want form to be a shitshow each time because you are pushing yourself too fast.  If you already have a lot of experience with the lift then you could probably start at .  Keep in mind that your squat is going to be going up  lbs a week youll catch up quick and the volume of work you will be doing is rather large.  Starting light puts you a week or two back recovering from an injury or overtraining will stall you for longer than that.I wouldnt worry about your arms SL will be putting them through plenty of work even though it doesnt seem like it.I dont really know what volume you were doing before but SL x will require a lot of recovery so be careful that you are managing to recover in between sessions.,gainit,copt6vr,1,t5_2s9bg

3189647,0,t3_2wn4nt,Gaining or bulking up isnt for everyone. Not everyone has a need to be big. Some people are perfectly content with a typical amount of muscle mass and have no desire to be bigger than they are.Gaining takes a lot of effort and motivation. Look at this subreddit. There are a lot of people here who find the process of gaining to be slow and challenging. They find it difficult to get their calories in they find it difficult to adjust their diet correctly they find it difficult to make time for working out and they find it difficult to find the right routine. And these are people who very much WANT to gain. So if your boyfriend doesnt have that desire and motivation there is next to zero chance of him changing his lifestyle around in order to meet that goal. It doesnt matter what reading materials you give him.You seem to be conflating gaining weight and muscle with being healthy which is not necessarily the case. You dont need to gain muscle mass to be healthy and have a lot of energy. There are plenty of skinny people out there who run marathons and have perfectly adequate levels of strength and energy and endurance.What I find odd about your post is that you claim that your physical change has made you less attracted to your partner. It seems as though you feel that because your look has improved your standards are now higher you deserve better and your boyfriend needs to change himself in order to meet your new standard? I find that kind of depressing.I think you need to be honest with your boyfriend about what you want and why you want it and let him decide on his own what he wants. It is after all his body and his choice. If you simply want him to be healthier tell him and let him decide if he wants to make better choices. If you want him to change his physical appearance mostly for aesthetics because you now want to date a different person than you originally started dating I think youre going to be fighting an uphill battle.,gainit,coslus2,11,t5_2s9bg

You have just pointed that he is lb OVER his underweight mark therefore he cannot have anorexia as one of the the key criteria to be met to be diagnosed is extreme low weight.Typically anorexics are very much in denial of their disorder and will actively state that they are fine and not suffering.

Op should go to a nutritionist and find out what to should do not listen to random people on the internet who might not have remotely enough qualification to tell an anorexic person to go to the gym.

Now in the grand scheme if hes eating a fairly consistent surplus this isnt a big deal. However judging by his potential weight gains hes not eating at a decent surplus.

4478246,0,t1_csusgdr,Not a professional but effective sleep is not about quantity but quality. A lot of people can feel exhausted even though they got  hours of sleep. Sleep quality all comes down to a few key things Diet.  Too much vitamin B or not enough magnesium in your diet can lead to restless sleep sessions. Caffeine should be avoided all day if youre someone who needs an hour or more to fall asleep. Habits. If youre like me you are looking at a digital screen for more than  hours a day. I use my phone even when Im trying to fall asleep. Bad habit! White light suppresses your bodys production of melatonin. Which means restless sleep. Try and not use your devices  minutes before bed. Light sleeper? If youre constantly waking up throughout the night youre not getting the REM sleep your body needs. Current biology models suggest that the difference in a light sleeper and a heavy sleeper is either genetics or lifestyle choices. If you want to be a heavy sleeper try practicing healthy sleep habits. Appliances like a white noise fan go a long way in getting quality sleep.If you do these things and you feel like  hours is good for you thats fine.

4622256,0,t3_3ea9d3,Chipping in maybe it will help you  was about  lbs when I was  up to  last year late thirties. Beer and getting older helped but I was still pretty skinny and certainly not very muscular. Had the same thoughts as you I cant really gain weight its my build its my metabolism and so forth.Started working out in may  but only in september I started counting calories with MyFitnessPal. First day I counted calories I was at about  and I was thinking SEE! Its just my body Im eating enough.  Second day thinking I had eaten about the same as the day before I checked my calorie count at pm  calories. Whoops. Apparently I wasnt eating as consistently as I thought.So I kept counting for a few weeks until I thought I had a good grip on my calorie intake. And behold in december I weighed  lbs I gained  pounds in  months! Realizing that was a bit too much I stopped overeating and since then I remaind at about  lbs. Last month when I was on holiday some random people called me big guy. I never was big guy  I was tall guy at best.Some tips in gaining weight from what Ive learned Use the barcode scanner in MyFitnessPal. First I though I had to enter all calories manually which was a big threshhold to get started and I was very happy when I found out the barcode scanner. Include everything. Dont forget that lump of sugar and the whole milk you add to your coffee. Dont cheat because The main objective of MyFitnessPal is to make you aware. Aware of the amount of calories you are eating aware of what foods are calorie rich and arm but also which food holds lots of sugar or salt or other more or less bad shit. You dont have to use MyFitnessPal forever. In my case after a few weeks I got a pretty good idea of the different foods I was eating and what to avoid or embrace. Or try to.  Any way approaching it like this reduces the chance that you get demotivated. You dont have to go all healthy or all McDonalds. Find the foods you enjoy there are options. Im a big pasta fan for instance and there are lots of pasta recipes some I like more than others. Find your own preferences dont follow diets blindly because that again will only increase the risk of you getting demotivated. Adding to the previous point its hard enough to eat more than you feel like so choose the stuff you like and that is still relatively healthy. However youre probably gonna get used to eating more than you did up to now. So basically get aware try your best but give yourself a break every now and then.Some tips on foods that I really liked to eat Chicken! Ad some taste preferably some asian stuff like soy sauce garlic onions peppers and the different seasonings and add to your pasta potatoe rice meal! Nuts! I love cashews but lots of other nuts will do. You can eat them as a snack but also add them to various dishes with chicken and rice! Peanut butter! Not my favorite spread but not bad. Whole wheat everything bread rice pastas. White is bad brown is good. Eggs! Scrambled with cheese and bacon.Good luck.,gainit,ctd7ksk,1,t5_2s9bg

It looks as if that is causing you to push off with the front of your feet rather than staying balanced on the middle of your feet. With lbs its really good to nail your form now so that when the gain train takes off youre not hurting yourself.   Deadlifts need a little work. Back staying straight but drop your butt down a little to make your back more of a  degree angle to the floor. Again with the lighter weight this wont pose a huge problem. But as you get heavier your back will get wrecked if you dont fix it now. You seem to keep a straight line while pulling up and keeping the bar close to your body. Thats good! Dont be afraid of bruised or scraped shins. If you dont like bloody legs wear high socks.   Congrats on keeping up with the first few months. Keep up the gain train and youll be able to pull heavy ass weight before you know it. Its good to get form down now so you can prevent injuries in the future.

5001358,0,t1_cuopit1,When you first start out youll make progress pretty much with any routine that you chose to do. The important thing is just to get in the gym and start lifting ASAP. The sooner you start the sooner you will see results. It also depends on what your goals are. Do you want mass or do you want strength or maybe both? It might help to start off with a strengthbased low volume heavy weight program so that you have a good strong foundation. Then you can add hypertrophy exercises for looking big high volume lower weight. I dont know how much you eat now but youll pretty much have to be eating constantly if you want to take in that many calories. Either that or eat  HUGE meals. My breakfast is usually about  calories by itself. Make sure you count your calories. As far as food goes  of my diet consists of the followingeggsbaconwhole milkchickenbrown ricetunatrail mix or nutspeanut butter and jelly sandwichesprotein shakesbananasIm not super strict but I usually try and eat fairly lean making sure to get enough protein daily.

I get tons of compliments on how I look now.The biggest advice I have is  make a workout plan and stick to it and  EAT and learn to cook!

I have a lot of super easy cheap and quick lt minutes or low maintenance oven cooking meals if you all want someEDIT There was a lot of responses for quick and healthy meals to cook. What I do is make a few side dishes and a few entrees and then I can mix and match themchange the seasoning etc so I dont get bored. Its a very modular range of food and most other recipes will simply be slightly more complicated or measured variations of these cooking methods so once you get these down you can pretty much cook any meal on the stove or oven easily Sauteed ShrimpBuy easy peel uncooked shrimp  meal is    pound depending on how hungry you areHeat up olive oil I use Lime flavored olive oil amazing and I cant recommend that enough on sauce pan stove mediummedium highPeel shrimp and wait for oil to get hotPlace shrimp on pan and put on pepper and some saltCover and let cook for a bitOnce the shrimp starts looking a little brown flip the shrimp with tongs and let the other side cookShrimp is done when each side has some brown crispiness on them Sauteedmarinated chickenBuy the uncooked chicken tenders as opposed to the huge chicken filetsOPTIONAL The morning of that day mix up a marinade packet spice aisle in supermarket and put in the chicken tendersHeat up oil in sauce pan on half powerOnce oil is hot put chicken on the pan and cover If you marinated dab the chicken w a paper towel or else the marinade will pool up in the pan and make it cook slowerlook messierOnce chicken looks slightly brown on the bottom or the top starts to turn white flip and let cookOnce both sides look slightly brown NOT BLACK put on plate SalmonBuy salmon filet    pound filet for a meal depending on hungerSet oven to OPTIONAL My favorite seasoning is mixing paprika thyme sugar salt and pepper and then lightly cover the top of the filet with the rubPut filet w seasoning on foil lined tray that you sprayed with cooking oilGeneral rule of thumb is to cook salmon  minutes per half inch of thickness measured at max thickness which generally leads to  minutes for most filets just make sure to checkTake the fish out and put on plate after the timer goes off fish should be easily flaked off and eaten from the skin if not put it back in for a few minutes at a time Side Dishes  Microwaved rice w vegetablesBuy it and follow directions cooks in about  minutes depending on brand.

These cylinders weighed at minimum  lbs and at most  lbs.After doing this for  months I had to cut a permanent bracelet from my wrist because after completed a build my wrist was at it largest size and it felt like the bracelet was going to restrict blood flow.My hands also swelled in size. So much so that I was not able to close them after building the tool several times in one day. Although this was probably from over use and probably is not healthy.The part that was continuously strenuous was the amount of torque I had to use while simultaneously gripping the cylinders with enough force so that the cylinder was not slipping in my hands.I think the best way to replicate this workout at home would be to head down to your local hardware store and buy two pieces . inch diameter threaded steel pipe one male and the other female.

5655808,0,t1_cwy02dj,Well firstly youre welcome! Hopefully something I say is helpful at some point.Second make sure you make a distinction between dietary fat as found in things like olive oil and other oils nuts ampc. and adipose tissuebody fat. Dietary fat does not equal body fat. The best analogy Ive heard for fats and carbs in regards to fuel for a weightlifterathlete is that carbs are like gasoline and fat is like diesel. Carbs are important for a couple reasons the main ones being that the LAST process protein gets used for is rebuilding muscle. When you exerciselift you are putting a lot of demands on the body and there is more going on than just breaking the muscle down and rebuilding it. Youre also expending energy in the form of glycogenglucose as well as hopefully burning fat during anaerobic exercise.Protein is used in almost all of these processes and rebuilding muscle mass and in theory building more of it than was there before cause thats the point right? is the very LAST process it attempts to use protein for.So if you dont have any carbs to burn through during your workouts or to help replenish your glycogen for next time working out will most likely get harder and harder as you slowly have less and less energy for working out. In turn the majority of the protein youre eating will fill in those gaps and youll need more and more to reach those same muscle mass goals from before.While ideally we want to keep carbs to a bare minimum to avoid body fat gain we need them to add mass. Ask almost any bodybuilder and unless youre an outlier ketogenic freakazoid like Jamie Lewis youll need carbs to grow especially if youre natural.In reality its just about balance and longevity both in terms of you as a person and in terms of your gainer diet continuing to show you benefits.,gainit,cwy5pb7,2,t5_2s9bg

You tell yourself This is my body I hate it and it hurts but theres nothing I can do. Im just made to be like this.... You cant fathom that you can change and anything but rapid progress will do little but reaffirm this. Its why so many dieters fail. They dont see visible progress in a few weeks and so they give up thinking it didnt work.But I kept with it and it may have taken three months but waking up to look in the mirror and utter When the fuck did I lose those inches off my gut!? was what kicked me hard enough to realise that I CAN do it and that my body CAN change if I just put the work into it. I control my body and my weight it doesnt control me.So now that Im bulking again yeah I get nervous about the fat I gain and my waistline and that my abs are disappearing even if they were never cut to begin with they were partially visible. But I keep telling myself that when its all done I can do back to cutting and all that muscle is going to show through when the fat drops off like taking off a robe hiding everything beneath.Thats the attitude youve got to have.

5842190,0,t1_cxlaf6j,You covered it pretty well actually. However the difference between clean bulk and dirty bulk is more on the quality of food you eat rather than the caloric surplus. All dependent on your goals. Some people want to gain mass but still have a healthy life style so theyll eat whatever caloric surplus consisting of complex carbs unsaturated fats fruits vegetables etc... A clean bulk. Others will just want to gain mass no matter what regardless of their overall health so theyll eat caloric surplus of butter cheeseburgers pies etc... A dirty bulk. You can still do a clean bulk with a  calorie surplus though just like you could do a dirty bulk with only  calorie surplus.Other than that youre right. Dirty bulk clean bulk vegan paleo GOMAD. Doesnt matter. Its calories in vs calories out. Like you said find your TDEE and go over it.  calories over is usually a good start and adjust based on weekly weigh ins. Weigh yourself in the morning after you pee on the same day. Your body goes up and down about  pounds throughout the day so just make it as consistent as possible. Aim for gaining  pounds a week. More than that? Eat less. Less than that? Eat more. If youre trying to lose weight aim for losing  of your body weight each week.And as far as macros go protein is really the only one that  for sure  matters. About . grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. So hit that and go over TDEE and youre be good to go. Id recommend doing a ratio of  carbs  fat  protein in your diet but theres a lot of debate to that and it mainly comes down to personal preference. Just get your protein get your calories and youre set.,gainit,cxlfrlg,3,t5_2s9bg

I will give you my two cents but I am going to have to remove this.If you are at low enough weight to have it influence your periods then that is your body and a million years of evolution telling you it doesnt think you have enough food coming in to bring a baby to full term and the breast feed it after.  This could be related to things other than nutrition but your doctor is concerned and this you should heed the advice of herhim.In terms of gaining weight you just need more healthy calories coming in.  There are lots of tips on the sub  you can search and surf and find them.  Lots of tips on high calorie snacks high calorie shakes etc.  The advice in the FAQ is mostly relevant to you.Lifting with this is optional.  Since this is a medical issue the right move would be to consult your doctor.  Typical advice is to first worry about gaining some body fat first which will help hormonal issues.  After that you can worry about lifting if you want to gain a more muscle  rxxfitness is a good place to go to figure how to do this and understand how muscle can make you fitter and if you choose get more toned.

6142379,0,t3_3zoffi,gtIt seems peoples main concern with Starting Strength is its lack of arm development and lat development in the long term as long term followers of the program have overdeveloped chests compared to back and overdeveloped legs compared to torso. Is this simply solved by chucking in some hypertrophy? Or would it be far better for me to follow the program or one of the others as it comes and build that foundation then kick some ass on programs like Jim Stopannis week one? Thanks all It doesnt really matter since youll only be doing the program until your noob gains run out ie  months anyways. The point isnt to make you stage ready its to add a bunch of mass all over and make you a lot stronger. gtis its lack of arm development and lat development in the long termIts not a long term program you do it  months and shouldnt permanently disfigure your physique. That said your arms will grow.gtlong term followers of the program have overdeveloped chests compared to back Again there are no long term followers and of people who do the workout Id say its the opposite people who focus on the compounds tend to have bigger backs than anything.gtoverdeveloped legs compared to torso.Again doing a program  months aint gonna overdevelop shit. Hell. you should be happy to overdevelop anything who ever heard of overdeveloping a muscle? So no I wouldnt worry about any of this the program was made because its balanced they thought of this before it was created. Once its over with you can begin focusing on tinkering and making things to your taste now that you actually have a physique worth that kind of focus.,gainit,cyntomh,1,t5_2s9bg

I brown the meat with the onions to get a sort of caramelized onion taste.I use this slow cooker it is a little pricy but if you are wanting a easier way to brown its the way to go. I can just turn it to brown brown the meat and then switch to high slow cook.I also want to point out this post I make this every Sunday its so good and much better then nuking it to cook. Of course you have to nuke to reheat but it still has a great flavor. I use Bobs redmill rolled oats for less sugar. ,gainit,cyvfh16,2,t5_2s9bg

6275219,0,t1_cz2wasq,Its not that the hypertrophy days wouldnt benefit you  they would. Its that youre losing a workout day when you look at it right. With GSLP youre hitting everything three times per week. With a twoday split youre hitting everything twice.With an LP youre adding weight every session. With a heavylight wave youre really only increasing weight once per week.So youre going from GSLP where you add weight three times in one week. To PHUL when you only add weight once.Does that make sense? Youre slowing your progress down way too much.PHUL as laid out is for people whove plateaued and theyre looking for a way to bust that plateau. So they work in two different rep ranges and two different intensities which theoretically should cause extra adaptations and stimulate strengthgrowth gains again.But you havent plateaued. You want to be progressing as often as you can. On a twoday split thats two times per week.Wanting to switch programs due to scheduling programs is a totally valid reason for wantingneeding to switch. Its just that in my opinion your body is still at a place where it would benefit most from something that looks like a linear progression program. I also switched my programming due to scheduling. I made it upperlower and still aimed at progressing every session. Its perhaps slightly suboptimal because you lose a workout each week but I believe its a totally valid approach. ,gainit,cz2x6tr,1,t5_2s9bg

This can really be a blessing  meaning that if you start eating like a fucking champ and working out you will definitely see more muscle gains than fat gains. Put in work. Its that simple. A huge misconception about the gym is that the gains happen in the gym. This couldnt be farther from the truth. True gains happen outside of the gym and they depend completely on what and how much youre putting into your body. Trust me the fact that you need to eat more is a blessing and you should treat it as such. I am not an ectomorph so I actually have to strictly regulate what I put in my body. Realize how lucky you are eat a shit ton every day and keep hitting the gym. Good luck! PM me if you have any questions. ,gainit,d0y7vqi,1,t5_2s9bg

They all swear by it and all grew taller than anyone else in their respective families. They hit  while no one else passed . Heres another piece of potentially bullshit advice Ill give you If you have an inversion table or any way to hang upside down for a bit try it. Itll spread your spine out maybe itll aid in getting taller? I doubt it but why not.On to the real advice I kept growing until I was around . KEEP EATING!!!!!! I also malnourished myself eating like  calories a day until senior year of high school. I firmly believe that had I eaten more I wouldve grown. Secondly you need to exercise.Youre in puberty right now there is NOTHING that is better than starting then. Your body is pumping natural steroids through your body PLEASE take advantage of them. Thats a regret of everyone who starts later. Start a lifting program learn the lifts dont get discouraged and keep grinding. Start doing some cardio as well. You should be dead tired from exercising you need to keep eating and make sure you also sleep alot.

The location had just opened so everything was brand new including very nice locker rooms which I didnt think Id ever care about but found I liked. The place is still VERY clean. If you like using weight machines the ones at my PF are nice. And there are  sets of several kinds   leg curls  hamstring machines. They do have a leg press you load plates on as well.The bad Like most are saying No barbells. No benches for barbells or bench press. No deadlift platforms obviously. Dumbbells only go up to  lbs same with the fixed weight curl bars.  Limited in terms of pull up bars since there are no squat racks. I do feel like there is a bit of a stigma against fit and more serious weight lifters when I walk in and Im not huge or ripped either... But Im pretty sure its just in my head.Other things There is a lunk alarm on the wall that is supposed to go off when people drop weights are grunt excessively but it has only gone off once in the  times Ive been there. The pizza Mondays is pretty sadridiculous have boxes of pizza stacked that you can grab a few slices after you work out... And Im still not sure what PF truly does this for. Keep fat people fat for job security??All in all since the price is so cheap I tell myself I can go without doing squats with barbells and without a true bench press and make do with the smith machine versions.

7317596,0,t1_d29e879,gt As I continue to lift more bodily pains can seem more apparent.I think this may be counterintuitive to what you are saying above  you might be in pain because you are UNDER weight. Trying to lift heavy with not enough mass on your body will wear it out more than lifting with more mass.I dont think gaining mass is a concern for quality of life and longevity until we are talking about the  range for someone your height. Being below that isnt that heavy where I dont think it would be a concern. You can maintain that kind of weight without excessive body fat or strain on your system.Likewise with lifting weights everyone worries about the dangers of lifting weights what about the dangers of NOT lifting weights? Going through life with less strength and muscle sets you up for more injury at the hand of everyday tasks and less overall fitness and durability. Especially as you get older loss of muscle mass becomes the number one factor for declining quality of life for old people.Theres an argument to be made that having some meat on your bones actually makes you healthier than being skinny. A BMI of  is correlated with the longest lifespan whereas a BMI of  which is slightly underweight is about even with the risk of death of someone with a BMI of  which is well into obesity.  Being frail thin and bones and the corresponding lack of muscle mass is apparently just as dangerous as being moderately obese. Whereas people who are moderately on the overweight spectrum are still just as healthy as those of normal weight. Having a little meat on your bones due to the benefits of muscle is very beneficial to longevity and this is even in untrained non lifting people. A lifter with a BMI of  will be in much better shape than an average person.,gainit,d29yltc,2,t5_2s9bg

8973115,0,t3_536cfu,Your goals are totally achievable with hard work. It can be done!  But it sounds like there are a few misconceptions that we need to clear up to make sure you get on the right track. First of all lets clear up the big one first theres no such thing as turning fat into muscle. Doesnt happen. Not a thing. The body puts on fat at a quicker rate than it puts on muscle and the body will only put on muscle when the existing muscle region is being challenged by resistance training aka weight lifting.  So there is absolutely no reason to gain fat unless you WANT to be fat. It will not help your goal of being muscular wont even help a little bit. The next misconception is related to the first one it is absolutely not true that you cant put on muscle unless you already have fat. Thats straight up not true. In fact your muscle definition will probably look more impressive more quickly if you put muscle into a skinny frame with no fat covering it up. But rest assured there is absolutely no truth to the claim that you need to be fat to put on muscle. If your intent is to start lifting eventually I suggest you do it right away. Youre just wasting time if you put it off. The most important things to do. Calculate your TDEE with any of the free online calculators you find on google when you google TDEE calculator.  This will tell you how much you need to eat every day to maintain your current weight. . Eat  calories MORE than that every single day. Try to keep a consistent distribution of carbsproteinsfats but dont stress too much about what that distribution is. I wouldnt recommend going above  protein or  fat unless youre really dedicated to a keto diet. .. Lift. Seriously. Get on a program like StrongLifts or PHUL or ice cream fitness take your pick. Just like food consistency is more important than the specifics of which program you pick. Just lift hard and dont get fuckarounditis. Just get out there and do it. Do that and youll get big and it wont be too much fat. ,gainit,d7qfl2a,3,t5_2s9bg

When in fact you can only absorb so much protein in one go. So easy guideline if youre training often you should intake .g protein per kg of bodyweight. Also you should try g carbs per kg of Bodyweight.

9546643,0,t3_5bn9fb,I wanna clarify some commonly used terminology on this subReferring to a bulk as clean or dirty generally defines the quality of what you eat while you are bulking.  Clean bulking means your foods are healthful not processed and planned out to give the correct nutrients and kcals for your macros. You are still bulking I.e. putting on far and muscle at the same time just doing so in a healthy way. Remember having body fat is not always bad.  A dirty bulk is basically cramming whatever high calorie crap you want in your slavering maw counting most of the calories to make sure youre over TDEE and going hard in the gym. Its less efficient and can have health implications. Its very hard to get full nutrition on a dirty bulk.  What you are suggesting is generally referred to as recomping. You have to plan a perfect diet to get nearly exactly the amount of nutrients that you for your TDEE including your exercise with a slight surplus to provide for muscle growth. This allows you to gain muscle mass while burning off fat stores resulting in a muscle only bulk.  If you can plan it out and stick to it sure recomping is awesome. Heres the deal though recomping is really fucking hard. Its a lot of commitment. Its really so much immensely easier to do a regular clean bulk by eating healthful meals over TDEE maintenance then cutting by taking those same meals back down slightly below maintenance.  Either way its not going to be easy and in the end its up to you to decide how much time and effort youre willing to commit to this.,gainit,d9ptk95,3,t5_2s9bg

10218382,0,t3_5m7f4l,Here are tips to not feel hungry all the time. This is base on an article I have read. . Eat real food and avoid the processed refined nutrientdepleted stuff. The more nutritious food your body gets and the fewer empty calories you consume the happier your body becomes which results in a healthier metabolism and less intense hunger signals.. Include protein and healthy fats with meals and snacks. They take longer to digest and help keep you feeling full longer.. Eat lots of vegetables. They are nutritionally dense  full of fiber vitamins minerals antioxidants  and fill you up. Try to include a rainbow of colors  white green yellow orange red blue and purple  everyday.. Limit excess sugar. If you must have dessert have a small amount  just a bite or two at the end of your meal  so it doesnt send your blood sugar soaring. Avoid sugary drinks including soda and fruit juice.. Avoid Artificial Sweeteners. They perpetuate your sweet tooth causing you to crave more sweets and they they interfere with your bodys hungersatisfaction signals which can make you hungry. I noticed I was often ravenous within an hour of drinking a diet soda. Opt for a big glass of water with lemon vegetable juice green tea or sparkling water instead.There are a lot more guides on how to not feel hungry on this article  like you must have no food in view to not be tempted to eat. goodluck!,gainit,dc2b7sb,2,t5_2s9bg

If you throw in a few apologies for taking up their time being a hassle etc. theyre just generally much much more helpful. Edit Even if you threw the product away or dont have a receipt ask them.

11697095,0,t3_66vdi1,The easiest way for me to diet is establish a cutting plan first. So right now I am cutting. I eat  calories every day. That includes  grams of protein and all essential fats and micronutrients very healthy. Then when I want to bulk I add an extra  calories of mostly complex carbs sweet potatoes oats brown rice beans. So I break that  up into  calories per meal. Its really easy. calories seems too aggressive and youre gonna gain a lot of fat. I would try  first then if youre not progressing with you lifts increase it. But make sure youre eating healthy and are consistent or else you wont feel good and wont hit your lifts.,gainit,dglvubc,1,t5_2s9bg
