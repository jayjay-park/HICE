72948,0,t3_1uxf32,Sort of wondering what they would make these characters do if they do end up in the new show. I know Betsy can be in it probably for the shoplifting but the others I wouldnt know. Well I think I remember Aaron Pauls character mentioning that Saul helped his friend before I think it was when they needed a lawyer to get Badger out in season . Not  sure about that but that could probably have him in that episode,betterCallSaul,cemqfwc,2,t5_2u05j

I mean its pretty much how were introduced to his criminal lawyer side after he already turned Walt down for being shady.But any more little eggs they crack open from Breaking Bad itll just add to the enjoyment of the show. Makes consistency. And at how attention to detail anal the Breaking Bad crew is I think some of it may make its way into the show.At least the Paulo one Im thinking thats gonna be a big season story that sets up whatever happened. But they are stuck with wrapping it up in a way that leaves loose ends for Saul to be worried enough about people coming after him.,betterCallSaul,cnbpi1p,3,t5_2u05j

2793988,0,t1_cnlmv7h,Seriously? Nothing?How about the fact that Vince Gilligan amp Co are in charge? Havent they earned your trust by now by crafting one of the best if not the best TV shows ever created? I mean  does them being in charge of this show guarantees that BCS will be amazing? Of course not but should that give everyone a reason to belive that its going to be great? I think so.How about the fact that we will see Saul and Mike again and explore their characters in depth? I just cant understand how anybody who was a fan of BB would not be excited to see those two again. Especially after it was confirmed that time jumps will be a big part of the show Odenkirk in the recent interview said that they are really jumping around  he repeated it  times  in my opinion possibilities where they could go with that are pretty much endless and very exciting.Also critics have already had a chance to watch first  episodes of the show and although reviews are still not allowed spoiler free reviews will show up in about  weeks time or so I read every single critic that has voiced their opinion about what they saw has said that the first  episodes are great  I have seen about  of those opinions havent found any negative or neutral ones so far.Of course this show is not going to be BB and it will not try to be BB. Gilligan has repeated many times that they want this show to stand on its own two feet. And for you to say that BCS may be a success only because of the rabid loyality of BB fanbase is ridiculous  like there is no chance that this show will actually be good. I have a completely opposite opinion  so far nothing about this show has indicated to me that it will not be a great show. I couldnt be more excited.,betterCallSaul,cnlnzh5,4,t5_2u05j

Then I became even busier with work again so I kept telling him to watch without me and I would catch up but I never really found the time to sit down and binge watch it.    I would watch with him when I had the time but between all the other shows we watch together work and life in general its hard to find the time to fit another show in there.  Im sure he would love to rewatch it with me but I just havent committed to it yet.    I actually said to him last night during BCS that I should get pneumonia bronchitis and a double ear infection like I did last year so I have some time to do nothing but watch BB all day for  weeks straight and understand whats going on with BCS.

Hamlin doesnt want him to do this. He plays along with Chucks belief that hes going to return to work. Why doesnt Hamlin want to pay out? Time preference or liquidity preference for the cash he would have to give up? What happens to Chucks share upon his death? Maybe the law firm partnership agreement means that Hamlin is better off if Chuck dies while still a partner than if he cashes out beforehand. Im not sure how generally a partner dying would result in that share being cashed out regardless especially in the case of a law firm which are not able to be owned by nonlawyers.Maybe Hamlin gets part of Chucks share in the firm if he dies?,betterCallSaul,covk74q,2,t5_2u05j

It seems churlish to say it but I have found BCS fairly boring so far.Theres not much happening in each episode. The story kind of meanders toward a destination we already know so thats not really suspenseful. Will Jimmy become corrupt? Well ... yes. Theres no side stories of interest the Kettleman thing wasnt particularly interesting he has no other cases that we know anything about. It all seems like setup for a destination that we already know.Also I am surprised this hasnt been mentioned more but the main actors Odenkirk McKean and Banks all seem too old.

3392522,0,t1_cpeyqmn,gtMatt taking the money any scenes involving Matt seeing those scenes playing out would waste time and in no way make the episode any better.Actually showing scenes like that would save time not waste it  because a skilled filmmaker like Vince Gilligan can convey a lot of information in even a single shot. Most of this episode is occupied by expository dialogue. A great deal of this exposition could be told visually.As for whether it would be better to do it in this way I think it would. If shot reverseshot dialogue between two characters does it for you then fine  though you can find storytelling like that on Eastenders. Heres what I would love Id love to be made to feel absolutely disgusted at Mikes behaviour by seeing the crooked business he and the Philly cops get up to. Then Id love to have to have the bittersweet conflicting emotions when he extracts our sympathies during his heartfelt sofa scene at the end of the episode. That would have been a wonderful contrast something which Breaking Bad was very good at providing. But just telling us about Mikes misbehaviour doesnt make me feel much towards him. Imagine if  rather than showing us Gus killing someone with a boxcutter  we learnt about the boxcutter incident through Jesse and Walt talking about it over pancakes.

Hell Chuck may even get over his mental condition as hinted towards the end of the episode and go back to HHampM leaving Jimmy in the dust. The beginning of this episode sort of hinted toward this as Jimmy wasnt as supported by Chuck at HHampM as I would have expected.

He had relapses into his old self every once in a while wanting to let Krazy  go.Jimmy McGill is a bad man trying to be good. In Better Call Saul he really is trying to do the right thing. Look at what he did for Kim. He went into Elder Law so that he can try to get away from being Slippin Jimmy. Yes he has relapses into his old self taking the retainer from the Kettlemans the skater guys scam at the beginning etc. like Walter does but hes really trying to make a legit practice and become a good person and a good lawyer. But it seems like everyone around him isnt letting him do that. Yes the bad choices he makes are his but I have a feeling that he would be a lot more successful if Chuck would just help him escape Slippin Jimmy.Of course we know where all this will lead to...the episode of Breaking Bad titled Better Call Saul.,betterCallSaul,cpwf1kf,3,t5_2u05j

Bit of an asshole move to lie and let someone else talk to him but whatever.Its a huge dick move to fuck over your brother the way Chuck does a second time. Jimmy found that lawsuit it was his and he goes to Chuck for manpower but also to help Chuck recover from his illness. Chuck should be grateful hes part of the team. Not to mention this shows that Jimmy slogging through all those shitty jobs wasnt an act hes a hard working good lawyer who finds a multimillion dollar case. To not even let him work on that case because it makes you jealous is awful.Not to mention hes a hypocrite. Hes all about the sanctity of the law except he works for a top firm that defends rich embezzlers while Jimmy is scrapping by making wills for reduced rates for the elderly. He thinks his brother is too tainted and unstable to be an actual lawyer but hes perfectly willing to work on it This is despite the fact he quite literally went insane in the eyes of medical professionals only saved from treatment by his brother.

Nothing can change that. Chuck is completely aware of that.

And so many goddamn repetitive storiesthemes that are completely unrelated to the actual show. Also the fact that this  last one is  days late and counting is just icing on the cake.  ,betterCallSaul,cq6jcyx,11,t5_2u05j

3660387,0,t3_32agku,spoilers for season Why do people think he was a total douchebag? I never got that sense at any point during the series. I kept in mind that backstory could eventually be revealed to justify Jimmys hatred of Howard but nothing shown on screen ever made him look bad. And the backstory that was eventually revealed showed the opposite  that Jimmys hatred of Howard was based on misinformation.Hank wasnt a bad guy either just very insensitive. This insensitivity was shown through walters eyes so its a bit biased too but it was actually shown on screen  telling walter to get some excitement in his life dehumanizing criminal scum and not caring about their lives thinking that Walter would be comforted to know that he would take care of Walt Jr. and his family not realizing that he was suggesting that he could replace Walt as a father figure  for his children.Howard in contrast wasnt shown to do anything so explicitly douchey. . He sent Kim out to pasture which was only told to us via Kims conversation with Jimmy and that decision could have lots of justifications. . He dealt bad news to Jimmy during his party but would it really have been better for him to wait for Jimmy to tell all his friends that he was going to be an employee at HHM seems reasonable to deliver the news ASAP. . He used to call Jimmy Charlie Hustle  this could possibly be interpreted as patronizing.Those are all the things I can think of... on screen Howard seemed to treat Jimmy with respect even when Jimmy barged in and interrupted his meetings.As for whether Howard will play a larger role in future seasons I think its possible. I think the actor playing Howard is very good in the role so it would be a shame to not put the character to good use.,betterCallSaul,cq9icq3,20,t5_2u05j

Hes alright with drug use extortion and assault as well. Hes the one who will fight wholeheartedly for ABQs most untouchable scumbags. Its his calling. Its where he belongs. It cant just be a negative thing. He must get some measure of satisfaction out of being who he is.

Chucks warranted but dickish speech would have never happened if Jimmy didnt deserve it.  There were times where Chuck was legitimately proud of Jimmy until Jimmys deceptions came to his attention.The reason he has of blocking his brother at the firm is theyre about to go on a massive case and Jimmy is a liability.  His antics in the dumpster is already questionable and taking drastic trespassing measures to acquire evidence could get a case thrown out and waste all the time effort money and reputation going into it.  It also prevents justice from being done on behalf of the old folks.  It sucks but Jimmy ignoring the law could undermine everything hes done in his life.  Even Kim addresses this and it will lead to future drama with her.  Chances and trust are earned.  Chuck was proud of him but was deceived like the billboard charade.

Commercials websites mailers etc. would all be normal and common place to a plaintiffs class action firm. Theyve never really said what type of firm Davis amp Main is or HHM for that matter but it seems clear that  HHM doesnt do plaintiffs work generally and  Davis amp Main does otherwise they would not have farmed the case out to them. Kind of a strange reaction by Main then. The types of law firms that have to advertise generally dont care about the tone of the advertising so long as it gets results. Especially strange because the Mesothelioma add they put out was not a class but your run of the mill asbestos case that we still see advertisements for which makes it obvious that Davis amp Main is a plaintiffs firm. ,betterCallSaul,d0jfor2,15,t5_2u05j

Instead she plants some seeds as if she didnt think Mike would worry that theres apparently frequent gun shots near the house of the only family he has left refuses to let Mike stay over so he cant verify her claims himself and the next day claims that things have escalated. Its the way she said I was here and you werent when as far as she knows the only reason Mike wasnt there was she told him not to be that just feels to me like she was trying to guilt him implying that he wasnt there for her last night the same way he wasnt there for Matty when he died obviously she underestimated Mike as she clearly had no idea he staked out the street anyway.Remember how in Breaking Bad Mike seemed to have pretty much no relationship with Stacey despite the fact that he pretty much lived solely to provide Kaylee? There has to be a good reason behind that. Thats part of what makes me think that Staceys actions in the last episode were motivated by trying to get money out of Mike rather than some form of PTSD.Something else that happened last season that also bugged me about Staceys character. In RICO she describes the hush money Matty took before his death as only a drop in the bucket which is what leads Mike to start taking jobs from the shady vet. The way she says it just seems so calculated even last season it made me think she was using Mike.

Think about it theyre both lawyers theyre both played by the same actor they both love to crack jokes.But my biggest piece of evidence is this the show about Jimmy McGill is called BETTER CALL SAUL!!! The very same catchphrase Saul Goodman uses in Breaking Bad. I mean think about it. This cant just be a coincidence.

As an aside when I rewatched BB the first time I was surprised how much went on each episode my memory was it being slower.  I think the same applies to bCS.Warning some spoilers following from the first  episodes!!Were only  episodes in and think of how much has happenedMikes DIL is either going bonkers or squeezing him for  leading Mike to up his game  Mike and Nachos relationship developing  the cobblersquatting  Jimmy gets a great job then proceeds to lose it  Jimmy and Kims relationship progressing then... ?  Jimmy and Chuck  Chuck showing up at work to keep an eye on Jimmy and sabotage? him  Kim takes a walk on the wild side and likes it the stock broker but steps back  theres more  What makes the show great  the writing directing cinematography attention to detail the van outside the taco place with the logo from crazy s fathers store from back in BB season  episodes ? acting etc.  Its a class act.  Doesnt mean everyone doesshould like it and your question is valid as is your opinion.Part of it is that times have changed.  Watch showsmovies from the s or so and theyre much slower than todays.  Around the time MTV started shows started a faster pace  rapid cuts etc.  Tarantino is a good example of a more frenetic pace.  BB and bCS hearken back to an older time.

Plus since he actually went to that university hes bending the truth which seems less severe than faking the diploma entirely if hes ever caught. He could blame them for sending him the wrong year or name when he submitted a request for the school to update his diploma with his new legal name if he does change it legally. Regardless the point is the diploma is just a photoshopped piece of paper that serves as a wonderful prop. Its all part of Jimmys longest con ever his performance as Saul Goodman criminal lawyer.,betterCallSaul,d13b3aa,2,t5_2u05j

This aint  the level of writing that elicits a BRAVO VINCE from me.The other more nteresting interpretation is that in a JekyllHyde moment Kim Wexler Esq. turns into Slipping Kimmy who wants to play the game to steal the client to beat Howard.

I think this was set up this way to show that Kim was really eagertrigger happy to transform into Slippin Kimmy Gizelle as a result of the stress she was facing.

7309741,0,t1_d28fgzq,I love Chuck as a character he seems really true to life.  I see  my younger self in him with some of those same issues.  The way I see it is that they came from a dysfunctional family.  Chuck was always the responsible one who tried to be the missing adult in the family.  He does everything he can to be competant and helpful but no one ever seems to care about him in such a personal way as they do to Jimmy.  I can easily imagine him going to his parents and saying Arent you proud? I just graduated first in my class as a lawyer and them saying good then you can help bail your brother out of prison.  Even when hes in the hospital he does the right thing by not eating so he can be with mom and when she wakes up all she wants is Jimmy.  So he goes to the law and that becomes a substitute family for him.  It isnt as good as a real family but at least he can earn loverespect by being great at it.  But now Jimmy shows up again.  And yet again in spite of having spent his life doing great things Jimmy gets the real love. Its happened a bunch of times on this show but just in the latest episode Chuck gets hurt and no one shows up.  No one cares at all until the moment he says he isnt going to work anymore.  Then they care. I think that kills him.  He sees himself as giving literally everything and yet hes still expendable.  People like Jimmy for Jimmy they like Chuck because he can give a genius presentation and keep a client. Ultimately I think Chuck is resentful to his brother because he feels that no matter what he does in his life he cant make people care about him and in the end his brother  who could care less about his legal accomplishments  is the only one who does.   ,betterCallSaul,d292g8a,2,t5_2u05j

Something that we have been anticipating has finally occurred and although we knew it would we didnt know what the reaction would be. We were left to ponder for a whole year what Hanks first step would be knowing this information. What exactly in this season finale parallels that idea? The tape recorder indicates to us exactly what Chucks reaction will be. He plans to use it against Jimmy on a personal level since legally he cannot use that tape in a court of law. So in a sense yes we are waiting to see how that plays out as Hank did with Walt but we know what the intentions will be more or less.

If Chuck actually quit HHM and has doctors who know he is nuts nothing he says will hold up. It makes it crazier that Jimmy when explaining how right chuck was said it the way he did. He said these things in ways where he says shit he is making up. Its actually pretty crazy how right you were. What about Ernesto though? He already lied for Jimmy. That obviously doesnt fit the narrative that Chuck was right. Why would Ernesto lie for Jimmy? Chuck wont get that to make sense.On top of all of this and lightly mentioned Chuck is actually insane. Jimmy will do fine. But the major question we almost forget about because of the way the episode went even the episode seemed to forget was what about the whole mama drama? Mom obviously loved Jimmy more it was confirmed to Chuck when she said only Jimmys name before her death. Chucks bitterness started then. Before his brother was a nuisance but now hes an enemy. Has been since that moment. How coldhearted do you have to be to not tell Jimmy his mother said his name right before she died?Thats cruel. But then following that weve seen all the other shit Chuck has done to hurt Jimmy. tldrThoughts on the matters above major prediction belowRegardless of the above assumptions I assume Chuck will be killed and it will be done to appear as suicide. I predict Jimmy has him killed by Mike. Mike is already in the business of trying to cover his own steps so I could easily see this happening. Jimmy now only has his girl to be concerned with breathe of fresh air everything seems great now. Then she recognizes what happened and Jimmy confesses to her that he had his brother killed.

Its honestly hard to answer your question because some of Vinces episodes work really well as standalones while some might not. For example the episodes pusher and drive are fantastic and could work as their own short films. But then there are episodes like XCOPS amp small potatoes which are comedic episodes that are borderline parodies have a lot of injokes and theyre much better if you are acquainted with the characters.Allinall you should be fine if you watch all of his episodes by themselves but you might get confused or weirded out if you dont know the series.,betterCallSaul,d2rwdzp,4,t5_2u05j

James McGill is his real name and we are going to find out soon why he goes by the name of Saul Goodman. My theory is that at least at first he does not want a bunch of cartel members to know his real name. And then why he goes by the name Gene should be obvious,betterCallSaul,dftbfw1,2,t5_2u05j

11557057,0,t3_64y8dq,I didnt really think about it too much as I was watching. I was honestly a bit disconnected from Jimmys moments in this episode because the symbolismmessages felt too obviousforced in. Like talking with the air force kid. I think itll feel more natural as the season progresses but I wasnt immersed in Jimmys part like i was before. The half rainbow was like okay this obviously means something but it bugged me because rarely does anyone leave a job half finished in such an obvious way. It doesnt seem like something Jimmy would do. But since youve prompted me to think about it Id say its possible that it represents how hes moving away from his elderly clients. Kim says his clients loved the rainbow. In this episode hes walked out on multiple clients to deal with Chuck hes mixed up their names hes been less interested in what they have to say like the lady telling him about her family and the flowers. His thoughts are elsewhere. Its probably part of his process of becoming a criminal lawyer. Hes not really feeling it with elder law anymore much as he has a soft spot for old people. Maybe its because hes lost the last of Chucks respect. Doing elder law was part of trying to play by the rules to please Chuck and Kim and thats not an option anymore hes screwed it up too much. Chuck isnt going to be proud of him for it. Maybe hes thinking about doing something else already. ,betterCallSaul,dg5zvr2,17,t5_2u05j

I wonder if we will start to see Chuck becoming increasingly regretful of his actions as this season goes on so that by the end of it when he is all alone hell wish he hadnt been so cruel to Jimmy. Alternatively perhaps the final evolution of Jimmy to Saul will involve him killing Chuck  in that scenario I dont think wed see a development of Chucks at present nonexistent emotional side.

The issue with it IMO is that when Saul popped up in the BB universe before it was a brief bit of levity in a very bleak environment.  Hes annoying in large doses and the longer it goes on before he breaks really the less Im giving a shit about him.  If anything every time I see Saul or Kim Im hoping it wraps and we can get back to MikeGusCartel type stuff.  The backstory of Saul really should have wrapped season midway season  at most.  Walt and Jesse were tragic figures relatable and painfully dealing with their decisions and inadequacies .
