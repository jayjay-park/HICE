46386,0,t3_1ummoa,I dont really hate them but Harbaugh certainly rubs me the wrong way. He just doesnt seem professional and I think some of that is rubbing off on the players. I wouldnt say all of them though. The guys who have been around prior to Harbaugh coming on Willis Gore Crabtree VD seem to rise above the petty sniping that Harbaugh seems to love throwing around at press conferences. I think to an extent Kaepernick has adopted a similar mentaility to Harbaugh which makes sense  Harbaugh is a QB after all and probably spends a ton of time with Kaepernick in practice etc. The one thing that I am very interested to see is if San Fran can sustain the success that theyve experienced over the last few seasons under Harbaugh. Harbaugh is benefitting from a very stacked roster full of top  picks and high nd rounders. Now that theyre finally playing to their potential I think a reckoning is coming in terms of contract and salaries. Plus Id like to see what Baalke can do with his picks now that he has to draft in the late s and s. San Fran also likes to be active in free agency which is fine for the short term but if you dont draft and develop well you turn into the Redskins or the Cowboys  always trying to find that one or two year fix.  ,GreenBayPackers,cejpmry,5,t5_2qqd2

634711,0,t1_cgceiq6,Exactly.  Its not like theyd put him there for good.  What OP is suggesting is that he might see a few plays there a game.  Honestly it wouldnt be the worst.  The offense would not have a great idea of where the pressure would come from because Matthews could rush inside and Perry or Peppers could drop back.  Also Matthews isnt just our best pass rusher hes our best linebacker period.  He can cover he can stuff the run and he can run like a deer.  Just because he wouldnt be rushing the passer on a few plays doesnt mean he wouldnt be in a position to make a play.,GreenBayPackers,cgcf0ya,6,t5_2qqd2

Defense shitty for awhile hey now lets focus on that!  Hey Mike how about we focus on improving all sides of the ball constantly.  Never settle.Plus his play calling is subject in my inexperienced opinion too many i bet they wont expect me to do this type of play on like rd and  and  is because teams think no one is stupid enough to run the ball up the middle but not us oh no not us. And not taking advantage of the cannon thats under center.  After  I felt they tried to use Aarons arm sparingly to try to keep the defense guessing when he would unleash which wasnt an issue for the offense for some reason in .  Its far too easy to attribute the holes in the team to the coach one human being and so for that reason McCarthy doesnt deserve the sole responsibility of the teams performance just for not putting his players in the best opportunity to perform.

1304240,0,t1_cigbzm6,As far as the WRTE spot goes I can definitely agree at this point it is completely up in the air. I do think Adams will be better than Boykin in the long run but I could see them having Boykin start at the beginning of the season just because he is the veteran and shifting over towards Adams through the season. Im also curious if the BoykinAdams situation and the number of other WRs we have at all changes how we handle NelsonCobb in the future.In regards to Thornton I think the one thing he brings to the table is as a run stopper which is something the team is definitely lacking right now. I kind of just think of our base defense as our run stop defense so thats why I put him in there.Lastly I dunno about about Hyde I dont think he beats out Ha Ha at the safety spot or Hayward at the CB spot.

1312383,0,t1_cigqkgh,gt Ehhh Barclay really wasnt that good in pass protection last year.Arrr! Agree to disagree I guess.  total pressures allowed in  snaps is a better rate than most of the league. It puts him average to above average in PFFs Pass Blocking Efficiency among starting OTs. He graded . over the regular season in pass blocking. It was his run blocking that let him down .. And if you make allowances by considering this was his sophomore season and first full season as a starter after signing as a UDFA in  and only getting snaps after week  that year then he quite admirable.Id be pretty excited if Lattimore started over Jones if only because I believe in Jones enough that Lattimore starting means he has made big strides in the offseason in terms of consistency and scheme understanding. If Jones starts Id be perfectly happy to see  levels of production from him.

1960494,0,t1_ckpflu5,Exactly.Our latest plan is hurry up offense nonstop from beginning to end. Not only do we run it all the time but we broadcast to the world thats what were going to do this year. It makes it stupid easy for teams to gameplan against and also leads to  and outs on drives that take  minutes or less. Coupled with the fact our run defense cant stop anyone and were watching opposing teams control the clock for a majority of the game and Rodgers sit on the sideline. We had a few opportunities to get off the field yesterday and had some piss poor penalties that prolonged drives. Its happened every week this year so far. Our defense is poorly utilized poorly disciplined and cant tackle. Peppers feels like a breath of fresh air because hes from outside our lackluster system. Hes already the best player in our front . Hands down. We overpaid the fuck out of Clay Im here for  weeks Matthews because he doesnt usually win double teams and hes gone or heavily hampered by injuries for  of any given season.Our best players on defense arent even from Ted. Shields and Tramon are FAs. Peppers obviously from Carolina then Chicago. Everyone else has really shit the bed across the board. Ill exempt HHCD off the list because hes a rookie but  out of  wont win you games on defense.Its time Packer fans stop making excuses because were the best because really were not.

2013376,0,t1_ckvstkg,Well lets see here from what I can remember the first bad call was the one on Peppers that simply didnt happen. Then there was the unnecessary roughness call when Shields merely placed his hands on Cutlers helmet for a few moments when he was in a slide that was a terrible call too...Then we had Jordys first down that wasnt a first down and the FG penalty where the Bears were called for holding and we got the ball back st and goal. To me it did look like holding I dont care what John Lynch  says hes taken too many shots to the head.So what else really favored our side? To me it looked like a pretty even distribution of bad calls if not the bad calls actually favored the Bears.

Sometimes Id go read what Vic had to say. But he said we were whimsical and needed perspective. I was whimsical in the difficult s and s Packerdom I passionately want a SB appearance EVERY YEAR WE HAVE RODGERS.But I get more information more digging into the details more opinions and more discussion here in this lovely sub.I only use the down vote button when people are either attacking without backupresearch or if they are Bears fans nah...we should even let them have their say.If you want to see some serious downvoting the Apple sub is disgusting.

We just dont have enough tightend play and checkdown down stuff to deal with good pass rushes.  Basically all we have is Rodgers running like crazy around in the pocket trying to make insane stuff happen.  Thats why we looked bad against Seattle and Detroit and thats how weve gotten knocked out of the playoff the past  years.   Often you can just tell when our offense isnt getting the plays they want off and you can sense that it isnt going to be our night.  The Seattle game felt like that from the beginning and so did the SF playoff loss last year.  Our run D sucks but the idea of our team is to keep our offense on the field and we lose when we fail to do that.,GreenBayPackers,cm0z9tg,4,t5_2qqd2

2371961,0,t3_2mifuc,GoodBad time! I need to write them for my own sanity. The Good nd week in a row where it seems like the question is what WASNT good?. I mean sheesh.  Aaron Rodgers is playing probably the best football hes ever played. He honestly has a chance to end up as one of the best QBs ever to have played up until this point and thats not really surprising. Super lethal in the pocket quick enough outside of it.  Eddie Lacy catching passes! Again! Third week in a row where hes been there in moments of duress for Rodgers and one of them even led to a TD! Rodgers clearly didnt have anyone else to throw to THE DEFENSE.  Holy moly. This defense is playing incredible and even though once again the opposing team had to abandon the run early on they looked fairly competent in the rushing defense as well. Clay at ILB is working wonders apparently.The Bad Nothing is ever perfect and hey neither was the kicking units! Botched snap Blocked FG Missed FG and Blocked Punt. Not the prettiest game but the score didnt really matter. I trust them to fix that quickly. Its not bad but its still a worry can this team hang against an opponent that WONT have to abandon the run after the first  drives? Well see in  weeks most likely as that Patriots game should be awesome. Although I wouldnt mind another Lambeau Massacre. Final PointsThis team is clearly playing the best football its played all year right now. I wouldnt say theyre peaking but they are playing scary good against teams. If they can keep up this pace itll be really tough for them not to be favored to grab a top seed in the conference. Go Pack Go. ,GreenBayPackers,cm4vrvg,0,t5_2qqd2

2494661,0,t1_cmk6ans,As a Southern California native born and raised in LA Ive seen this first hand many of times. As a dodger fan I get to see how the road team fans are mistreated. It breaks my heart to see grown adults say some nasty things to traveling fans over a game. Ive flown out to Green Bay on three different occasions  vs Raiders  vs Vikings and  vs Niners and the experience is amazing. I still feel like watching a game in San Francisco was worse though. I was there for the opener last season and it was bad. It wasnt just heckling. Packer fans were getting their lives threatened. It was scary. It wasnt like that in  when I went to see Brett play in Sam Fran. Fair weather fans I guess.

2861056,0,t1_cnt9k15,I think the problem was that on the later drives in the fourth quarter after the first few plays everyone and their mother knew that he wasnt going to do anything but run the ball. When everyone in the stadium knows that the run is coming its almost impossible to get good yardage reliably even against teams with bad rushing defenses in the NFL at least. I mean look how quickly they marched the ball up the field in the last minute of the fourth quarter. Of course he didnt have to and shouldnt have gone that berserk with the passing but mixing it up may have been able to keep those drives alive for a lot longer.I think it goes without saying that you cant rest all of the blame on any one person but I think if he would have been a little less conservative with the offensive play calling in the fourth they would have been much better off.,GreenBayPackers,cntaxti,1,t5_2qqd2

3159457,0,t3_2wbxlx,Weve wasted too many timeouts because he was late getting off the huddle was late seeing something on the defense and tried to adjust but the playclock was ending. Though that might be due to the play being relayed too late a.k.a. McCarthys fault.He has also missed some very recognizable blitzes presnap also can be affected by the getting off the huddle late.Either way he could improve in his presnap reads. Its not bad by any means but Brady and particularly Manning are better at that than him. Experience does help.He misses too many short throws and dump passes. He lacks touch on those balls. Rodgers is a very talented guy nobody gets to that level without talent but his uncanny accuracy has a lot to do with countless ours of relentless practice making said throws. Its harder to practice those touch balls because the conditions vary much moreso than timed throws for instance. Id say its his weakest point. He was also missing deep throws in the playoffs there are a lot of factors for that mainly his injury the weather and possibly disrupted routes but its also a point where he could improve.So mainly practice touch throws.Finally and most importantly stay healthy. Hes missed games the last two seasons and has played injuried multiple seasons    . Hes implemented different training regimes in the offseason especifically to prevent injuries but its been his main source of poor play.It may seem Im bashing Rodgers by writing so much but its meant as criticism not complain or derrogation. Its in essence two aspects of his game one where hes very good but not elite the other a minor aspect that isnt used much and a third part which is hardly controllable and very dependent on chance. Moreso theyre not very easily exploitable. But even Rodgers is human thus not perfect and these are areas of his game where he could improve.There have been rumored complains of his style of leadership but without any substante to it and in such a subjective area I cant judge if its an area of improvement or not.,GreenBayPackers,coph4w0,3,t5_2qqd2

The fan base might not be happy unless we take an ILB with the first pick but I think when the dust settles we will all be happy with our draft.

3234328,0,t3_2x5jwu,And yes the blitz can come from a number of positions in the  but the ILBs still play a specific role where they are required to focus on the run and the passing game most of the time. The OLBs basically can act as DEs or traditional OLBs depending on the situation and the use of  ILBs allows for one to occasionally be used in the blitz though not without risk. Ultimately Clay would not be able to blitz nearly as much from the Inside position so while youre right in that lining up Clay Inside and Outside would mix up his attack position forcing him to spend more time Inside will take away the number of opportunities in which he gets to rush the QB. I would rather the Defense know where Clay is blitzing from rather than not having Clay blitz nearly as much as he usually does. ,GreenBayPackers,cox8svl,1,t5_2qqd2

The new onetwo punch of NelsonCobb is without a doubt the best in football and with Rodgers dishing them the ball its nearly impossible to stop. Cobb is one of the smartest WRs in the league and I think letting him go seriously sets our offence back. Davante looked very promising but I dont think he will be able to fill the gap left by Cobb.

3365395,0,t3_2yq0w4,My take is that versatility is important and the Packers seem to value it more than most teams but I think we have to be careful with the versatility argument. There is a fine line between versatility and tweener. A tweener is a player that doesnt really fit anywhere but can almost play two different positions. A lot of  lb guys for instance can almost be a  DE or almost a  DE but often they cant really play either. I think the key is for a guy to be able to play one position really well and then to develop versatility after that. Cobb is a perfect example of a guy who definitely is a slot guy and is very good at it even if you dont move him around at all but he can play all over the field which is just gravy.Where does Shaq Thompson fall? I personally think his position is a  OLB but maybe he can play  ILB. Some wonder if he is an ILB SS or RB. That scares me a bit because it certainly sounds like people are seeing him as a tweener that doesnt really have a set position. I especially get scared when people start talking about moving him to the other side of the ball. I dont think there is a set answer on this it just comes down to what people think. Some think Shaq Thompson can play a specific spot and some arent sure where to put him.Funchess is the perfect example of a tweener IMO. He cant play TE because hes too weak and he cant play WR because hes too slow. He can almost play both WR and TE and he certainly looks like a good prospect but in the end I think he has high bust potential because that almost just isnt quite good enough.On Landon Collins people seem to see him mainly as a SS so that eases my concerns about him a bit. He seems to be more in the category of a SS that has the versatility to play ILB if you need in the nickel or something.,GreenBayPackers,cpbvp5p,3,t5_2qqd2
3367303,0,t3_2yqsoc,I think Hayward can play anywhere against anybody. He is elite IMO but he just needs time and a chance to prove it.

We do still have Hyde as well so as of now he would be the other outside guy which isnt that terrible along with drafting a guy. Its hard to say what we will do.

3625172,0,t1_cq5go3g,Yes you dont need . speed. But teams will shy away from late . . guys. Because there are a lot of speedsters out there. Not  but the thing with WRs is you can move and mismatch. You cant do the same with CBs most of the time. So you can use a WR situationally but you cant do the same with CBs. You need it all lenght and speed.It wasnt directed particularly at Hayward my comment it was more on the strain athletically that playing outside CB brings. I dont know why they thought he couldnt play outside. I brought up the same point regarding his speed. I could see it being it but it is the exact same time as Williams.One thing though. Williams was excellent at playing bump and run when he was younger and healthy which mitigates A LOT for lack of speed. Maybe Hayward couldnt compensate with press technique but now they think he is ready. It could explain why he didnt play outside despite being clearly superior by leaps and bounds to every other corner in the roster when playing zone being good at covering slot WRs in man which requires more agility and being a ballhawk.Something was wrong. I cant believe our coaching staff would be so obtuse when seeing Hayward play compared to the others and deciding he was worse than them.But then again Hawk and Jones...,GreenBayPackers,cq5hw4f,2,t5_2qqd2

3742788,0,t1_cqivqfb,I know it isnt easy. And even when you find a guy there are injury problems to deal with. But it is a hole in his game for a variety of reasons one of which drafting later in the st round. Personally I think it is a scouting issue and that goes for all of the defense. That doesnt all fall on TTs shoulders but he is the head guy so he gets the blame as well as all the accolades of which there has been much more. There doesnt seem to be any problem with drafting offensive talent but there seems to be an issue on the defensive side. It seems obvious to the outside viewer even if you take into consideration where they pick and unforeseen injuries and such. That being said if you know there is a deficiency in your evaluation of draft talent at a certain position common sense would dictate that you go about building that position group differently. Draft and develop is awesome and when it works it will help your team to higher levels by freeing up money to spend else where. But when it doesnt you are constantly trying to hit a home run in every draft and fill gaping holes that have been gaping holes for years. When it doesnt work you end up with projects that never pan out that you just wasted a roster spot on for  seasons.,GreenBayPackers,cqiwi4h,1,t5_2qqd2

So any way you cut it wherever he plays hes going to be taking someone else off the field. When you say hes going to be a versatile guy that doesnt really fit anywhere fine but then that causes the value of Hyde to go down because thats what he does.If the was a rd round pick even a late nd okay. This is a st round pick. I dont want a guy who doesnt really fit anywhere and wherever we have him he takes another guy off the field in the st. I much rather would have had a guy like Kendricks who can come in Day  and fill a major hole while still being a very good player and the  player at his position IMO. I even would have understood a DL if you plan on getting rid of Raji andor Guion next year. Just not a fan of this at all. It doesnt have the feel of a st round pick.

Lots of rotation with other CBs but these guys will be getting less time.  Unless one of them proves to be an absolute stud but thats impossible to predict this early.Hayward and Shields will be starting CBs.  Shields needs to play a lot better and more consistently to cover number  WRs but we dont have any obvious replacement for him at this time if he doesnt.  Theyll get Hayward in the slot a lot if the number  WR isnt as big a threat.Burnett and Haha have the starting safety positions locked down they arent going anywhere and will both be at the top of the Packers tackling charts again.Hyde will be moved around a lot sort of how they used Woodson in the later years.

4113839,0,t1_crp60tz,Of course the coaches have a better idea than we do but that doesnt mean they have the answer either. Its just a reality of the competitive salary cap league that you cant always have a complete roster. The fact that weve gone into each of the last two seasons with pretty obvious and serious holes at different spots on the defensive roster speaks to that reality. In my opinion there is a huge experience and talent gap to make up in the transition from a CB of Williams caliber to what we currently have available to replace him in .There are no great options Hayward was seemingly heir apparent but has numerous question marks. Hes inexperienced outside. Hes an injury concern at a position that generally plays  of snaps. Hes at the bottom of the speed range for a boundary corner. Hes a great playmaker when healthy and playing underneath zones and slow players but when he has to play the deep zones and more athletic and faster players outside we just dont if he can be an effective long term solution. Goodson didnt look good in  camp and didnt even crack a single defensive snap last season even after Tramon and Shields went down in the same game even on a team that likes to give depth guys looks late in games and at a deep and heavy subpackage position. I think its quite likely hes been kept around because of his ST chops where he is quite good and not because of what he showed in practice as CB. Hyde like Hayward is at the bottom end of the speed range for successful NFL corners and he doesnt have a great vertical to make up for it. Also like Hayward hes been most effective in the slot against slower players and without deep responsibilities. I dont recall what games youre referencing that youve seen him play boundary in the NFL but it couldnt have been more than a few snaps and certainly not enough to think hed be a competent starter. Rollins has tons of playmaking talent but his experience is  year of MAC play mostly in the slot. He also is at the bottom end of speed talent to play outside. I think he has the talent to make a fairly quick and high upside to a nickelunder zone corner in the NFL but I dont see any signs that hes going to be ready to play outside anytime soon and certainly not in year . Randall has the best long speed of all of the above but again like everyone else he lacks outside experience playing mostly safety at ASU  of those snaps as basically a nickelSCB. Hes also been out with injury although it sounds very short term so hopefully hell start getting reps soon. Asking him to transition to start at a completely new position while also making the jump from college to NFL rookie is a lot so even if he wins the job Id expect many mental and technique errors in year .Overall and longterm sure we have tons of talent and potential. We especially have an embarrassment of nickeldime corners for years. However right now we lack a  outside  and in my opinion its optimistic to expect anyone to emerge from the current roster as even an average starter. I think its quite likely well have to endure at least a half season of below average play opposite Shields at what is and has been out biggest liability this entire offseason since we let Williams and House walk.,GreenBayPackers,crp7bwd,1,t5_2qqd2

But theres a magic in how the Packers bring out the best in Flynn when other quarterbacks have failed e.g. Brohm and Flynn has always brought out the best in the Packers in their darkest hours. He has intangibles that are essential at the quarterback position e.g. leadership and I have little doubt that was part of what kept the ship afloat that day. The quarterback position is too essential to a teams success  no quarterback is a part of their teams greatest comeback victory of all time without making a serious contribution.

Why not go with the youngercheaper guy who might improve? That is the whole point of this entire debate.Yes I know Jones had a good . Im just saying that it was still a bad contract even with his play in . The same way that I feel Guion was given a bad contract except the zero guaranteed part. Or that we kept Goodson over Rolle or that we drafted Justin Harrell or a number of other things. The point is the front office does make mistakes.Im not marginalizing his contributions at all.

He just isnt very good and he doesnt have time to make much improvement unlike the younger guys on the roster.Im not in favor of just throwing away one of the few guys who has made meaningful plays in an NFL game.Which is fine to a degree but Guion just isnt worth it. At the end of the day his production is easily replaced by younger and cheaper guys that can improve. That is the point. Everything the Packers have ever done point to that being a fairly basic why for them to do business and with Guion being suspended for sometime on a nonguaranteed contract this would be exactly the opportunity to dos something like that again and move on with the younger cheaper and possibly better option.,GreenBayPackers,ctdwna4,1,t5_2qqd2

5004350,0,t3_3jhh2d,There are many people I could have chosen from. I could have chosen Ingle Martin J.T. OSullivan or Chris Hanson but I picked the Majik Man.Don MajkowskiHis name was pronounced MahKOWski but he was known as the Majik Man and for one thrilling season he was just that.Don Majkowski was a quiet private person off the field but walked with a cocky swagger on it. He separated his shoulder in his senior year at the University of Virginia and slipped off most teams draft lists. The Packers picked him in the tenth round of the  draft and he even started five games as a rookie under coach Forrest Gregg. Offensive guru Lindy Infante replaced Gregg in  and continued to cultivate Majkowskis potential.In  the Majik Man emerged for the one great season of his year NFL career. He led the league in passing yards with  and led the team to a  record with  touchdown passes. Five of those  victories were accomplished by virtue of a furious fourth quarter comeback led by Majkowski.However his greatest comeback of the year came in the third game and was unsuccessful. The Packers trailed the Rams  at halftime before Majkowski led the team to four second half touchdowns and a field goal only to lose  when Brent Fullwood fumbled at the Rams one yard line in the closing minutes.Most of Dons heroics had a happier ending.The Packers would trail the Saints  before coming back to win . Majkowski completed  straight pass and threw a threeyard scoring strike to Sterling Sharpe with  seconds left to win that game by a point.They were trailing the Falcons  going into the fourth quarter and won  on Chris Jackes yard field goal with  left.They beat the Lions  in overtime on another Jacke field goal. Majik threw the winning touchdown pass to Sterling Sharpe with nine minutes left in a  victory over the Vikings that veteran cornerback Dave Brown preserve with two interceptions in the final four minutes.Against Tampa Bay the Packers were behind  in the closing minutes when Majik threw an incomplete pass on fourth down. Fortunately a handstotheface penalty on the Bucs gave Green Bay new life and Majik drove them to the Bucs  where Jacke kicked a yard winning field goal with no time left.The Packers even handed the eventual Super Bowl champion ers a  loss in San Francisco one of only two Niners losses all year.The biggest comeback was against the hated Bears. Majkowski threw a fourth down yard touchdown pass to Sterling Sharpe with  seconds left to pull out a  win. What made this one special was that it came down to instant replay.After a lengthy delay to look at the instant replay official Bill Parkinson overruled the call and ruled it a touchdown. The Bears were so disgusted that they listed the game with an asterisk in their media book for years. And they were right he was past the line.The Packers stole the win that day but could not steal into the playoffs losing out on tiebreakers in that remarkable season.While Favre played longer and is the comeback king in Green Bay Majkowski had his princely season. He made the Pro Bowl in  and sat out the opening game of the next season in a contract holdout.When he got no free agent offers he joined a lawsuit against the NFLs unfair labor practices that would eventually be successful. While he achieved success off the field on the field was a disaster.Just as he was beginning to play well Don was sacked hard on his shoulder in the tenth game of the year and would require rotator cuff surgery. He would never be the same player again. He returned in  with diminished arm strength and injured his hamstring and missed half the season.Majkowski won the starting job under new coach Mike Holmgren in  but lost his slot to Brett Favre when he went down to an ankle injury in the third game of the year.In  he was a backup in Indianapolis in  he moved on to Detroit again as a backup. After the  season he was released and drifted out of football.For one brief shining season Majik was among the best quarterbacks in the league. While the team didnt make the playoffs that year they did provide enough thrills that Don Majkowski will always evoke fond memories from Packers fans.Source Packers by the Numbers Jersey Numbers and the Players Who Wore them by John Maxymuk,GreenBayPackers,cup7mpj,19,t5_2qqd2

We keep having threads talking about the TE position and they continue to have the same result a whole lot of nothing.Yes more production would be nice from the TE position but that position has also been heavily devalued in the Packers offense. I think they need to throw to Rodgers underneath more would help with our  and out problems watching Rivers stymie the D with underneath routes and seeing the Packers offense completely ignore those same opportunities Sunday was painful and help build chemistry.

5541010,0,t1_cwizntx,I think he gets annoyed of Packer fans asking stupid and leading questions. I love the Packers and read Vic and here are my takeaways from fan questions Packer fans constantly want Vic to validate that the Packers are the best of everything. Best quarterback best fans best history best historical coach most historical field etc. Thats selfrighteous! How many other teams fans are still getting upset while their team is . We are spoiled and insecure fans and he knows it and he calls us out on it and hes right. Packer fans have an obsession with trying to call Vic out as a Steelers fan and have him bad mouth and single out players and people within the Packers organization. Of course he is a Steelers fan when not writing for the Packers he grew up in PA. Who the hell cares? He has tons of knowledge and is insightful and always seems to make accurate football predictions. Why would he admit that only to have every fan nag him about it for the rest of his days and make the Packers.com website look bad. Again Packer fans are selfrighteous to expect him to be a Packer fan and be all giddy about everything Packers or single out people who arent doing well. Thats not professional.People just get mad because he doesnt say what they want him to say and that makes THEM selfrighteous. He simply slaps back the haters by proving that Packers.com has never been so popular and he is right. I have read him since day one and gained an incredible amount of knowledge about the game. I have also gotten to see how stupid others can be in their questioning. His retorts are fun and always make me laugh.We need to thicken up our skin and stop being so sensitive and put everything about the Packers on a pedestal. Everyone knows the Packers are great and have a great history. We need to stop trying to get validation about it every two seconds from others.

5554055,0,t3_3r6b6b,I think it is hard to pin the whole thing on the absence of Jordy though.  Your line looked like swiss cheese last night at certain times due in part to a great D Line.The GB run game this year has been atrocious and quite honestly at this point Starks looks like the better back.  Lacy isnt helping on any level.While you guys did face a solid secondary I dont think enough attempts were actually made to get Cobb going.  I dont care that the overhyped Talib was on him I would take Cobb over him one on one any day.I also think Rodgers has been trying to force TE Rodgers to be something he is not essentially Gronk.  Excluding Cobb last night the leading WRs were Rodgers  and Starks   those are catches made not attempts.I still think it is going to be GB v. NE in the Superbowl with you guys losing Tom Brady is a man on a mission this year.  The Denver game plan isnt sustainable.  Trust me as a bears fan relying on your defense can only get you so far.  Hillman and CJA had rare opportunities last night and Peyton hasnt been able to get his great WRs that involved all year.  Keep in mind he didnt throw a TD pass.,GreenBayPackers,cwlj4rm,5,t5_2qqd2

5707106,0,t3_3t9jba,Jordy is amazing. But number  number  or number  our team shouldnt struggle so much with the loss of one player. We have rookie and second year receivers and weve got Randall Cobb who is about a half a foot shorter than Nelson so hes no doubt a little easier to cover than Jordy. Couple that with the facts that Jordy isnt there to draw more heat away from the other receivers and that Rodgers doesnt seem to be on the same page as the receivers then youve got a crappy passing game. We have a RB who has asthma had an ankle injury now a groin injury and may or may not have a few extra pounds on him fat or muscle it doesnt matter. Weve got an Oline who cant open up holes for our RBs and Bakhtiari who gets plays erased by holding all the time.OUR OFFENSE IS IN A SLUMP. Thats it. Whether its just a player problem just a coaching problem or both I do not know. While we stress about all of it lets at least appreciate that our defense is doing pretty damn good in my opinion James Starks has shown himself more than capable of filling in for Lacy quite and our starting QB is not injured KNOCK ON ALL THE WOOD.

On the slants with YAC hes given a few times recently weve been crowding the LOS and blitzing often with single high which means he has no help inside or out. Thats basically asking a CB to cover any conceivable release which most NFL corners cant do this is why teams dont blitz all the time very few NFL CBs can effectively man up without some sort of scheme help.Generally CBs try to stay over the top and will give up the inside release in that situation since if they let the receiver get behind them it could very easily be  points.Randall has flashed good and bad this season.

All the old stuff wasnt as tight couldnt find a groove the automatic nature of the material wasnt there anymore and it was less musical amp fun as a result.Technique doesnt change but the second nature fluidity and coordination of something so precise as the passing game might require everyone working in concert in a way that extends beyond the individual skill and talents of the participants.

6152609,0,t3_3ztn01,Im not there YET.I want to see how we look again next year. I blame more Ted Thompson for this years offensive struggles because we planned SO MUCH around having Nelson without having an adequate backup plan at this position. In hindsight we had a severe lack of depth and talent at wideout. And literally no one saw this as being such a problem week in and week out. While its hard to blame anyone for this if there is someone to blame its the GM. Now all this being said I realize what MM has done for this team over the years. We are a perennial power house. But if there is one thing I have learned from sports as I have gotten older is that sometimes a change in leadership is not indicative of bad performance but is what is completely necessary to provide a fresh perspective. Sometimes a fresh face and fresh message is what is needed for a specific group of men. The players for the Green Bay Packers are young and the arrow is still pointing way up in many areas of the game. I am confident that MM can continue to get our team to the playoff every year and I always say that just getting to the playoff can mean we can win it all. But this year has changed my mantra everybody knows we arent gonna win crap this year.My fear is that I will look back over the Aaron Rodgers Era and see only one Super Bowl. I am old enough to know that one day perhaps sooner than later but perhaps not that soon the Packers are going to be a last place team. That is a certainty. The NFL and talent in the NFL is cyclical. And believe me I more than most realize how fucking lucky we are that we have had back to back HoF QBs. But am I going to look back over everything and only have a fear that we squandered opportunities?One Super Bowl every  years is not good enough for me when I feel like we have the talent to win multiple championships in a row. Hell we got the right guy under center and the window is going to close. Some people are happy with the  playoff appearances in a row but again my hindsight evaluation has shown me  of those appearances were not good enough. And sometimes its the chemistry that needs changing rather than the ingredients. Who better to shake up the chemistry than a head coach in the NFL.So if after next year when Nelson will come back healthy and hopefully the domino effect of shit is fixed we still suck and dont make it to the top of the mountain than yes I believe we need to fire MM. I love MM and will forever be grateful that as as fan I could see him watch his coaching magic and game planning magic take us to the top of the mountain once and close a variety of other times.But I owe my allegiance to the G on the side of the helmet and what I grew up watching with my dad as we fought to get satellite service in New Jersey every single game to see Magic Don and what I grew up to love as adult man is the Green Bay FRANCHISE.

6282506,0,t1_cz3ifeb,Im sorry this is just maddeningly illogical. By your reasoning Eli Manning is greater than Peyton Manning Trent Dilfer is better than Dan Marino and Terry Bradshaw is a top  QB of all time.  There is not a single QB in the league ever to play who is capable of producing wins. Only teams produce wins. QBs can merely CONTRIBUTE to wins. The way to measure a QBs contributions to winning which is the only definition of GOAT that makes any sense is through STATS. We dont just look at stats for the fuck of it we do it to measure which player did the most to HELP his team win. Wins themselves are not a good indicator of a players contributions because performing in the biggest moments DOES NOT necessarily result in wins. Aaron Rodgers has consistently outperformed Brady in big games and has come up short IN SPITE of his superior play not BECAUSE of it. He has lost because of things like botched onside kicks and RB fumbles and losing OT coin tosses and Brady has won because of things like late interceptions and long Vinatieri field goals.

6365129,0,t1_czd460f,If you dont get the point thats your problem.  Also why I said a glimpse  I didnt say it was an exact replication of that scenario.  Our team didnt just struggle it was likely the worst team in the NFL during that stretch and there was zero glimmer of hope.  Thompsons the one that was responsible for personnel and he had no viable backup in place.  Youre assuming an awful lot by acting like Thompson will be able to find a viable replacement at QB regardless of how much notice he has.  Its the most difficult position in football to fill.He struck gold with Rodgers.  A brilliant selection.  But that doesnt mean hell be able to do it again.  Rodgers was great.  The team as a whole though is not very strong.  Modest investments in free agent signings could help quite a bit there but Thompson wont do it.Lets say Rodgers announces today that hes retiring in two years and Thompson is only able to find an above average replacement.  You think this team would be worth watching?  It would be awful.  Why?  Because taken as a whole the rest of the talent on the team is mediocre.  The defense is average at best and the offense would be absolutely pathetic.  Special teams have never been a strong point.  Wed be lucky to even break ..  A good GM should not have his team on such a razor thin margin.  Manning went out and is still terrible even though hes back now the Broncos made the Super Bowl.  You think the Packers even make the playoffs without a healthy Rodgers?Thompson drafted the best player in the NFL.  He gets full credit for that.

If they are a bust the GM will be scrutinized.If that happens to a new GM someone without the track record of Thompson they likely lose their job over something like that.

6835451,0,t3_48svay,He was definitely given some chances throughout the year the road game against the Vikings in particular he got a lot of snaps against some average  weak DBs and didnt get much out of it aside from a DPI that was more the DB fucking up than Janis making a play.Running GO routes is great but you need to be good at tracking the ball and catching it if it doesnt fall into your hands.  Everything we ever saw Janis do said that wouldnt happen.  He was really bad blocking at times for as many screens as the team likes to run that didnt help his case either.  You dont just want to take that element out either the screen game was quite good.As other people have mentioned going up against Bethel is a small asterisk to this also.  Hes pretty much the Jeff Janis of the Cardinals on defense and he didnt have a good game here.All of that being said theres no way a performance like that doesnt change you somewhat as a player.  Hopefully thats some motivation and confidence to improve next year.  It would be reasonable to expect hed be better if he never played that game anyway.  I think we all wanted Janis to get more involved for the nd half of the season but they tinkered him in and all you saw was pretty bad play so I dont think this was some big oversight.  Definitely raises his stock for the future though and he played great in that game.  Hes nothing close to it yet but its hard not to be a bit excited about a guy with measurables nearly as good as Julio Jones.,GreenBayPackers,d0r3m56,1,t5_2qqd2
6838052,0,t1_d0owjyz,OLB is a need but its also a longterm need. Signing a veteran at the end of his career would not be a wise investment if we let Perry and Neal walk at the same time. If Matthews doesnt get moved back outside then it will mean we made bad offseason decisions like signing a  year old OLB instead of using that money on a ILB AND also not drafting a competent ILB. If we get an ILB good enough to start then we basically sign one of the best  OLBs in the league and at no cost to us. Signing Hali out of fear we wont be able to move Matthews back outside is asinine because there will be options in FA and in the draft to make sure we move Clay to his natural position. Signing Hali to the amount he is likely seeking would also be dumb even if we draft the ILB we need because Perry and Neal would almost assuredly be around longer.

6872407,0,t1_d0v9tsk,I think that way of looking at is misleading though.Had the Eagles won their superbowl against the Patriots they would have had better playoff success than the current Packers teams. They went to the NFC championship three years in a row. In my view that is much more telling and speaks of how they could compete with any team because they actually did make it to the NFC championship game multiple times. Looking at the Packers is misleading. They went to three NFC championship games but all spaced out with  year gaps in between. This is because of Thompsons draft onlyism style. It takes those draft picks several seasons to become solid players if they ever do at all. And the other years when the Packers lost in the wild card and divisional rounds is also misleading I think. For example in   I dont think anyone thought Green Bay was better than San Francisco besides Green Bay fans. And I dont think it is hindsight. During those seasons barely anyone picked the Packers to win those games. Everyone knew who the better teams were.,GreenBayPackers,d0vasay,0,t5_2qqd2

Healthy he was my  player in the draft but I dont think TT is likely to spend a first on a player who cant play for a long time and maybe cant play properly again at all. And i agree. We can get a really nice player on the defence with our first round pick this year who will make a big difference. Id rather do that and know what Im gonna get and watch them make a difference whilst we have a dozen players in contract years than stash a potential future talent on the roster. Hes gonna go midlate. If he made it to the fourth we could use a comp pick on him and thatd be cool although someone might take a flyer on his upside sooner.,GreenBayPackers,d1y9zqe,5,t5_2qqd2

The opportunity the Packers have had over the last two and half decades was incredible but they have failed to capitalize on it instead being satisfied flaming out in the divisional round more often than not and repeating well theres always next year.

8566823,0,t1_d6cd2me,Dude the way you are using the stats is literally nonsense and you only make it worse by admitting the sample sizes are too small. You cant just take his first seven and ignore the rest. You cant just take his best three and ignore the rest. Averages are the most valuable piece BY FAR. Using those other things is literally just cherry picking to build an argument that you even admit to being inherently flawed because the sample size is so damn small. None of that makes any sense.The whole point with Elliott was that Janis isnt special. I can literally just keep going and pulling random dudes from the Packers out that led the team in STs tackles as young players finishing in top  for tackles in the league House th overall. Elliott th overall. Fancois th overall. Martin th overall. Havner th overall. Banjo th overall. Underwood th overall. Janis being th overall isnt exactly some huge undertaking. You are putting a lot of value in something that is just okay.Im well aware that Elliot is a good STs player the same why Im aware that Janis is a good STs player and Banjo is a good STs player. My point is I dont think any of those three are exceptional. None of them deserve a roster spot just because of STs performance.gt I also noticed you declined to talk about his performance in preseason.Because preseason stats dont mean shit. rd string vs rd string in vanilla vs vanilla? Most of the value in the preseason is making sure guys can handle the lights and physicalityspeed at the next level. Stats dont mean anything when all you have done is run go routes past guys slower than you that arent even going to make an NFL roster.gt hes just a notalent scrub is incredibly disingenuous.Im not saying he is a notalent scrub Im saying he is an extraordinarily replaceable player.Being replaceable means you shouldnt have a gaurunteed roster spot.Im perfectly open to seeing Janis make the team but the insistence that he should based on his STs play alone is just unwarranted. He is good on STs he isnt great he isnt a leader he isnt a film nerd he just isnt exceptional. Again he is replaceable. ,GreenBayPackers,d6cfkwz,1,t5_2qqd2

It wasnt uncommon last year and never has been uncommon to see him rotate possessions with Starks and hes the type of downhill runner who needs a few carries to really get going. The problem I saw last year was that he wasnt really finishing games the way you want a powerrunner to finish. After  quarters of hard hitting the defense starts to wear out a bit and thats when you can really push em.... if youre in good enough shape to do so.He had a few runs that got blown up at the line but he fell forward and ran through contact and looked light enough on his feet that Im not worried yet... but well see after he gets some more real action.,GreenBayPackers,d6fzdw0,1,t5_2qqd2

Mike daniels takes  olinemen for a ride but is effectively out of the play leaving Pepper  against Vance McDonald.Peppers gets greedy and fails to set the edge properly tries to cut the play off inside effectively blocking himself.. As this is happening Blake Martinez and HaHa fill the same gap which allows the aforementioned Vance McDonald now free from the burden of blocking Peppers to get just enough of HaHa that it blocks Blake as well since he and HaHa were in the same gap.The play wasnt even towards Barringtons side of the field.  This was a busted play because after Mike Daniels takes the RT and RG for a ride the only blocker on the cutback side of the play was McDonald and there were  Packers  of them a future HoFer and another a vet of  years ready to stop the play.Edit  Source I have NFL rewind its early and Ive had coffee.,GreenBayPackers,d6ytgl0,3,t5_2qqd2

The Vikings mean business and I respect that. I also think the move is telling to the severity of Teddys injury. Bradford is relatively young and can be the guy until Teddy is either healed or until the Vikings can find a better option. I am not so uptight about draft picks as many others I guess especially regarding quarterbacks. We have had the luxury over the past  years of just always having the guy back there.  of NFL teams dont have that luxury.

8855360,0,t1_d7c0eyi,Why does it mean there has to be a locker room issue? For all we know they planned on dumping Sitton all along and just wanted to wait to make sure they felt comfortable with what they saw from the others before making the move. You wouldnt declare one guy the starter or put them ahead of Sitton in the lineup in that scenario because youre not sure and bumping him back could cause noise. Or maybe they didnt like how he was responding to his back and they got a final prognosis the medical staff gave them before final cuts and decided they wouldnt get their value out of him but another teams doctors dont have the same reservations. Both scenarios happen literally all the time in the NFL and neither needs locker room drama to explain.As myself and others have stated in this thread he is a  year old with a back problem playing at the lowest valued nonspecialist position in the NFL who is on the last year of his deal. No trade market materializing isnt a surprise when you take those things into account its to be expected. His open market value is quite different and has zero connection to the trade market because you can sign him to however long you want. ,GreenBayPackers,d7caews,0,t5_2qqd2

Yet they are higher than teams that made dominating performances against good teams. A few examples. Patriots without their best TE and their starting QB beat a team that everyone thinks is top . The Broncos showed that they still have the formula to win easily one of the best defenses.

That is lazy and disingenuous analysis.I mean come on dude you closed with Rodgers only having four passes in the second half when he had six passes and ten designed passing plays. It is great that you took the time to analyze what you did but you have some patently incorrect stuff in there as well as completely misrepresenting an entire drive. That deserves criticism.Runpass ratio is a very well established stat to analyze conservativeaggressiveness in coaching and how coaches play the scoreclock. It is simple and straightforward throw it out is about as silly as throwing out an entire drive in a game analysis. Runpass on first down is also very valuable because the downdistance is always the same and defenses tend to play the most vanilla on first downs.Not sure how the Rodgers scrambles skew anything those are designed pass plays not designed run plays they get lumped into the pass portion of runpass ratio.Dunno why you are assuming I didnt watch the film just didnt feel the need to do a playbyplay because putting up a text only playbyplay is kinda of meh value to me.

Sitton wasnt cut so Taylor could make the team Taylor would have made it regardless.  Backman was an option at TE its not like Cook has done much so far.Lang came out for  snap and Barclay gave up a sack.  Taylor is fine but having both is better.  Im not saying you have to agree with me but its silly to think about it in terms that Sitton had to be the one to get cut in order to sign Bakh.

9144065,0,t3_55irtg,I think its just too early in the season to decide this but Ill give it a shot. Watching Butt yesterday he is reliable but does not seem worthy of a st round pick at all. Doesnt seem all that athletic maybe it was just because Bucky has such a good defense but if Im taking a Rd.  TE he needs to be a playmakervertical threat. I would take Butt late second. I would really only want the Pack to trade up for OJ Howard Nick Chubb or Mike Williams. Choosing between Howard Chubb and Williams depends on how our TEs RBs and WRs perform for the rest of the season. I definitely would not mind pulling the trigger on a playmaking WR. OJ Howard would also be sick. That man is a monster and I think he will be very good in the NFL. That said I doubt he makes it out of the top  maybe even top . Chubb would be cool but this years RB class is so deep that we could probably find a first round talent in the second this year something that TT loves doing in finding value picks. ,GreenBayPackers,d8b2qe9,4,t5_2qqd2

9350447,0,t3_58kdbh,I honestly think everybody shitting on Rodgers this game is full of shit.  Hes thrown mostly accurately these receivers have  had absolutely zero seperation and that fumble was a strip sack that any quarterback would have likely fumbled.  Rodgers has done well this game put any other quarterback in and theyd have performed the same. Cobb would have dropped the passes the fumble would have happened.  But go ahead keep shitting on Rodgers.  Then when you get rid of one of the few good things on this team right now youll be left with McCarthy and the receivers.

Gunter was great but our CBamp struggled and our LBs in coverage werent great either.Their offense was better than our defense and our offense was better than theirs.

9630931,0,t1_da04wtv,After  games here were two fluke games Jags Bears away from that same  record. Youre using that logic to call the  team basically a  team so it applies here too. The only reason the Packers are a game out of the division lead is because the rest of the division collapsed take away the inept Bears take away the collapsing Vikings make the Lions stop Lionsing and the Packers are effectively out of the playoffs.Yeah that team was bad but it was also decimated by injuries it wasnt only some intrinsic terribleness.

9642072,0,t3_5d31y2,Seems about right maybe a little high. Right now the offense seems a bit better than mediocre. We are solid in catch up mode but it seems like any time we are in a big spot in need of a drive we are not able to get anything going consistently. We looked good in Atlanta with the short passing game and like most fans I would like to see us get back to that. Atlanta is pretty poor defensively and most of their wins are shootouts so it would be interesting to see how that offense would look against a team like the Eagles coming up. Meanwhile the defense is piss poor. Like up there with the ersBrownsSaints for worst in the league piss poor. We can not stop anyone unless they are already up and trying to run out the clock with runs up the middle. Feels like any type of unexpected run or pass goes for  yards. We cant rush the passer cant cover anyone in the secondary only way we stuff the run is by committing to it. Just way too many blown coverages mental mistakes and quite frankly a lack of talent. People will point to injuries and we have been a bit unlucky especially at CB but other teams are also dealing with these and having depth that is at least NFL capable isnt too much to ask right now ours is not. ,GreenBayPackers,da1l1bm,4,t5_2qqd2

I also believe in TT but I think we were cursed this year.  Everything short of Aaron getting hurt has seemed to befall us.  For years weve been lucky with next man up.  And MM is doing enough on O...but that doesnt matter if the UPS guys playing on the D cant make stops.Im disappointed we are all disappointed but rash decisions and coaching turnover will turn us into the Bears of late more likely than resulting in success.  ,GreenBayPackers,da9ly8j,0,t5_2qqd2

9721807,0,t1_dab69a8,Completely agree. I was most upset Sunday night at the blitzes. You dont leave your worst players by themselves. It was the worst possible play call if your corners are hurt. Coaches saying we need to blitz because they cant cover is so ass backwards I dont even know where to begin. Im assuming that capers thought he could use doubleteams on Daniels to free up blitzes but it DOESNT MATTER WHEN ANY QB THATS EVER COME INTO THE LEAGUE CAN DO A  STEP DROP AND HEAVE ONE UP ON A GO ROUTE. It is literally the play every single quarterback can call and throw and a play every receiver can run a straight fucking line and capers gave it to them on a silver platter  different times in one game.I wonder if capers even goes to the locker room at half time. Its a far walk and I havent seen him take a physical step in over a decade. The lack of adjustments and discipline is a direct reflection of this fools blas attitude toward his defense to the point that us casual fans know when the blitzes are coming. I seriously think capers is milking his contract hoping for the other team to screw up worse than his own defense while simultaneously prayin that AR has a godly game.,GreenBayPackers,dabfavv,2,t5_2qqd2

Quentin Rollins has only played football for  years of his life and  of those was last year for us.Fackrell Bradford Jerel Worthy Micah Hyde Mike Neal BJ Raji Clay Matthews etc have all played ENTIRE SEASONS out of position from what they played in college  how they were drafted. Matthews at ILB worked for a bit until people realized he couldnt cover.Raji from DT to DE for two seasons. He was complete shit.Mike Neal was drafted as a DE were using  used him as a pass rushing OLB.Micah Hyde was a safety in college. He did roam a round A BIT but not enough to be considered a  CB like were using him.Jerel Worthy was drafted as a DE. Again we used him almost primarily as the pass rushing OLB that Capers loves so much. Tall long quick skinnier dudes to get around the edge quicker. Its called an elephant in Capers scheme.Carl Bradford only played OLB in college. Hes smaller so he played the quick edge guy. Thats it. We converted him to ILB and wondered how he didnt crack the roster against Brad Jones and AJ Hawk remember they were rated the  and  worst ILB for  I think it was.Fackrell is a pass rushing OLB and we drafted him there starting him there on occasion but hes been inside quite a bit as well.Ted LOVES project guys with good character. Its great having those character guys and versatility is great but its no wonder our schemes go to shit so quick when these guys are already playing out of position and then having to learn a complicated defense on top of it.

10032826,0,t3_5jdf8l,You are correct about prevent defense.  However I believe a lot of people use the term to describe soft defense or a wide zone to attempt to cover more of the field and keep players in bounds in order to run the clock.  This IS a good lategame strategy but also is dependent on the front  getting pressure and forcing the QB to make quick reads.  Problem is if youre not getting pressure there are a lot of holes and its just a matter of time before the QB finds a receiver in an open spot.  These zones are designed to keep receivers and TEs underneath and not allow big plays down field.The bears were finding a lot of guys open over the middle which leads me to believe we were most likely running some form of cover  for the most part.  Their play action was also working which is poison for a cover  defense because it sucks the LBs down when they bite on the fake leaving a gaping hole over the middle.Basically the combination of them starting to run the ball well which makes sense if we were playing cover  as it is generally weaker against the run us not getting pressure and the LBs biting on play action was opening a lot of the field up for them.  We did blitz a few times but the blitzers werent coming close either opening up even more of the field.  Personally I feel like their pass protection was the biggest factor.  Barkley had all day and had a huge pocket to throw from with huge throwing lanes.  Just about any QB in the league is going to be able to do well with that kind of protection.Another reason we may have been running cover  so much is that Barkley had been throwing high when going down field hence the two picks so maybe we were daring him to continue to do so looking for a possible overthrow?  Thats just a guess though.,GreenBayPackers,dbfay6i,11,t5_2qqd2

Same goes for an unleashed Peppers Matthews and hopefully soon Perry.  Our DLine is dominant our Safeties hold up the back up better than most and the versatility that Burnett and Hyde give us allow us to play specific match ups better which will be huge for the playoffs.

10166465,0,t1_dbwbbpv,For the second giants loss Rodgers Cobb Nelson Bulaga Lang Matthews Burnett Crosby and Goode were all playing by that time.As for the seahawks game Adams R. Rodgers Bakhtiari Linsley Tretter Janis Peppers Daniels Elliott Hyde ClintonDix D. Jones and Perry were added by that time. Also Lacy and Shields were part of this team as well. Outside of MLB CB RB and punter there was at least one starter from each position playing that game that is still playing today.What Im trying to say is that while five years ago our team may have been different many of our core leaders from that time are still playing. Two years ago aside from second and third stringers our team did not look dramatically different. There are several core players that were on those teams that arent with the packers anymore J. Jones Jennings Driver Finley Quarless Sitton Hawk Raji Woodson and T. Williams and the nfl does have a major turnover rate but the names that I mentioned that are still on the team make up for nearly half of our active roster. So it would be fair to say most of our starters were playing in that Seattle game and several of our leaders in all three phases of the game were playing in the last Giants game. I believe being able to compare the team today to the teams of the past playoff losses back to  is acceptable. Comparing the team to  is a stretch but the comparison happens because leaders for both teams from then are still playing today.,GreenBayPackers,dbwfaym,2,t5_2qqd2

Leading the th quarter Vikings take the lead GW  yard FG by Crosby sails wide right lose by  pt..   at Chicago late in season.  Team leads in the th quarter Bears come back to tie.  GW FG by Crosby blocked at end of regulation Bears get ball in OT march down the field and kick FG..   at Chicago early in the season  penalties against the Pack franchise record two TDs called back on Tauscher holds Tauscher literally never held lost by three after James Jones fumbled stretching for extra yards with two minutes left deep in Bears territory..   at Detroit late season. The ARodg concussion game.  Rodgers knocked out but not until after Jennings lets a sure six bounce off of his hands and into the DB for a pick lose by  points..   at Minnesota.  Final week the AP runs wild game.  Tied with  min to go but D cant get a stop and Walsh makes GW FG at end of regulation.  Costs the Packers a bye or Fail Mary earlier that year your pick..   at home vs. Bears midseason broken collar bone for Rodgers on the first drive still only lose by a TD..   at home vs Detroit midseason pt conversion near end of game fails recover onside kick GW FG by Crosby is completely shanked lose by ..   at home vs Chicago Thanksgiving GW touchdown is dropped by James Jones and it was right in his breadbasket at the end of the game next play th down last play pass deflects of Davante Adams hands lose by ..   at home vs. Minnesota final week gave up  yard fumble for TD to Vikings.

10254957,0,t3_5mujbq,Next up Dallas. Tripp seems to have been a good late addition involved all over on STs. Two deep safety looks almost all game same as the last Giants game. Protecting the CBs. Short passes in the middle of the field killing us again same as last Giants game. More young guys making mistakes on STs... Always. Got really lucky especially early that Giants WRs were dropping balls. Allison and Janis seeing lots of snaps early on offense Cobb not playing much early. Weird. Not really sure what the game plan was by MM coming into this game offense totally disjointed early. Fackrell seeing early playing time on defense over Perry? Interesting. Daniels absolutely wrecked a couple run plays. Love that man. Thomas played like one snap early with Ryan and then it was all Martinez and Ryan until Martinez injury. Repeating myself but Janis Fackrell and Martinez playing so much early is very perplexing to me. Cobb finally really starts taking over snaps in the second quarter turns out that was a fantastic idea.... Martinez was not good while he was in. Dont know why he was playing over Thomas anyway. Cook continues to be the safety valve for ARodgers he should not be being subbed off ever. Landon Collins for the Giants is just so good. So good. Seriously impressive to watch. That ARodgers scramble into Davante TD was absolutely next level. Insane. Cobb HailMary How do we keep getting those?! Michael has got to be one of the goofiest looking runners Ive ever seen. Seems to work though. Did not like MM going for it on th and inches. The play itself was even worse. Randall andor HHCD totally fucked up on that big TD. Not a good look and not the first time this year. Davante lined up inside running a slant has been absolute money all year. The little shake by Cobb at start of route on the TD was fantastic. Giants offensive and special teams mistakes were absolutely brutal. Painful to watch that many mistakes. Jake Ryan continues to be one of the most polarizingintriguing players on defense to me. Rip split way out wide was kinda hilarious. Definitely something that probably only works once. That cluster of a forced fumble and recovery by Matthews was awesome. Offense was so bad in the first. Run game abusing DRCs backup and some short fields really turned it around. Jordy injury. Full GIF thread from rNFL.,GreenBayPackers,dc6gelm,140,t5_2qqd2

10400745,0,t1_dcmvrtu,Using the TT system we are always in the playoffs.  Carolina Arizona not so much.  Seattle Giants are shells of what they have been.  Dallas apparently with or without Romo are going to have some cap troubles.  Who else uses the TT system the NE Patriots and they are always competitive.  System may have really started with Ozzie in Baltimore.  Does anyone really think that draft and develop doesnt work.We will likely get a th for Heyward and a th for Tolzien this year.  Some of these picks become cheap talent to feed the beast.  CB is the glaring and immediate need for this team  and there are tons of them in the draft.  If Julius retires and Perry goes we will need pass rush talent.  We have  picks in the draft.   Our style and leadership gets more out of the players.

I would like to see them made public again thats why I was thinking public crowd sourcing might be the best way to go.I also know of a film of the  World Championship game every play in color with the radio broadcast dubbed on it.

I hope Ted considers stepping down as well. He has failed at bringing enough talent to the team. Something needs to give. We have to make moves in free agency if we want another Lombardi. I really would hate for Rodgers to get the same Favre story and not get back to the big game.

10446807,0,t1_dcryj82,gt However missing the SB with the best QB in the league is a disappointment everytime.Agreed.  Like it or not the Packers have what wins Super Bowls a great quarterback.  Not only that but an alltime great.  Hell weve had two over the last quarter century.  And in that time weve got  SB appearances and  wins.  In  years.  One appearance and one win in the last .  This isnt about being spoiled.  Its about recognizing the luck weve had in having two of the best quarterbacks to play the game play back to back and having very little hardware to show for it.  But say that in this sub and you get called spoiled or unrealistic or a crybaby since we almost always make the playoffs.  Making the playoffs was a fucking dream when Favre first came to town.  Its different now.  With a QB like Aaron in this era the playoffs shouldnt be some acceptable result.  It should be expected with anything less than a Super Bowl a disappointment.  Might sound shitty hearing this as a Bear fan but its the truth.  Rodgers is going to retire someday and this team most likely wont see another HOF quarterback take over.

It was the absolute perfect call and the entire middle of the field was open with  deep safety and all the DBs were pulled wide by the WR routes.  Packers had  lineman out front and only one LB as a potential tacker.    But as Rodgers was planting his ankle twisted the throw was off and the Packers ended up punting that drive.

I know the rookies all have signing bonuses which count as dead money if they are cut and the packers have more than  players at the bottom of the top  contracts that are all being paid k with no dead money if they are cut.  The first four rounds have a cap hit of more than k so the th through th rounds wont impact the cap at all outside of signing bonus which Im not sure how that is calculated during the  player cutoff.  Not taking the signing bonuses of th rounders into account the cap hit of the first  rounds is . million.  With the signing bonus accounted for it is . million if you just assume the yearly proration counts against the cap.  If they keep all  draft picks and bump the rest of the k players down it is . million in cap hit total.  So closer to . to play with for the moment.If you go with OTCs recommended effective cap hit of spending  k per draftee the total cost is  million.

11792053,0,t3_68967w,My thoughts on day   Let me try to do this by Position and inside each position the round Id like themQB  NoneFB  NoneRB  Semaje Perrine th Jeremy McNichols th Corey Clement th Donnel Pumphrey th Joe Williams UDFA  The drop off for me between Perrine and the rest is pretty steep. Brian Hill is somewhere in the middle there but I dont want him.WR  My guy Carlos Henderson got picked then I very much liked Kenny Golladay but he also got picked from there talent drops off for me  Bucky Hodges th Dede Westbrook th Ryan Switzer th  Not much left at that position for me. Bucky Hodges is listed as WR here because the position Match up end doesnt exist. Id use him all over the place and wouldnt ask him to block much Jimmy Graham like so he fits at WR in my mind. GB also has enough TE.TE  Jordan Leggett th Jake Butt th George Kittle thOT  Julien Davenport th OG  Erik Magnuson thDL  We just picked one so I dont think theres a need for another but I still have slated  Ryan Glasgow th Josh Toupu thEdge  Carl Lawson th Vince Biegel th  this pool is so shallow... Im really bummed Trey Hendrickson got picked before our pick.ILB  Ben Boulware th Tanner Vallejo th Riley Bullough UDFACB  This isnt much of a need anymore but there are still guys left on the board that could be value picks  Jalen Myrick th Sojourn Shelton thS  This isnt much of a need anymore but there are still guys left on the board that could be value picks  Desmond King th Eddie Jackson th Demetrious Cox thK  Ummmmmm...P  No information.....Final Thoughts  In my mind there are a ton of prospects left in the th and th round with quite a hole in the th. Seeing as there are so many th round talent players left Id wager that a handfull will drop to the th round when the packers pick. It also wouldnt be a shame to use one of our  late th round picks to assure a th round prospect.With That being said I especially would love either Carl Lawson or Bucky Hodges with the first pick of the fourth round. Perrine is good too after him the drop off is steep. With our second fourth round if GB doesnt take Carl Lawson Id love for them to draft Vince Biegel who I actually liked more than TJ Watt Id also consider WR with Dede Westbrook. Desmond King would provide excellent value in the th round and I wouldnt be mad by that pick even though we already took a safety.,GreenBayPackers,dgwo3e1,7,t5_2qqd2
