5093362,0,t3_3krxue,Hay Day  Level     Cool Farm Designs. This video is about the level s farms on my friends bar. It will cover everyone from level  to  and will show you the kind of designs people have chosen for the land across the road from their farms.This land was given us in the last Hay Day update in June and really allows the creative side for many to come out. I love to explore and look at these cool layouts.Let me know which is your favourite and why. The best ones will be added to a video later to show the favourite ones from around the world.Dont forget to subscribe and like this one.,HayDay,cuzxw1u,1,t5_2vbk7

5426702,0,t3_3p5oe6,Just to let you know what Virginia said is the correct information provided on the internet for fixing the issue but it may not fix it. If you have two Hay Day accounts associated with your FB account it will never ever stay logged into the account of your choice. SuperCell made some changes to the game and didnt really tell people. If Virginias advice doesnt fix your issue the only way to fix it is to send a support message through the game to SuperCell. You will then have to pick which account you want to be attached to FB. They will completely sever the tie to the other account so choose wisely. They told me they would do it one time only. ,HayDay,cw5bfj6,1,t5_2vbk7

5951879,0,t1_cxznmmv,Hi eviehcurtThank you for your kind words! We might consider putting higher point derby tasks but all that would happen then is that everyone whos doing  point tasks now would jump to do the new highest tasks and nothing would change! As for the other suggestions well consider them for future discussions thank you! Cheers Cami,HayDay,cxztkvs,2,t5_2vbk7

11803814,0,t3_68ezvs,Join ours! Here are the details We are all very nice and helpful and would love to have youWe are a medium sized hood looking for several more members. Most members are from the US or Canada but were not too concerned about location. We are somewhat chatty in the game and we do not use any outside apps. Most of us play multiple times a day. We are usually in the Championship league. We expect our members to complete  tasks at  points or higher. Some members will take the th task if were close to placing but its not necessary. As long as you finish all  tasks we arent too concerned about when they are completed. If you are not interested in derby but want a nice hood join! Just remember to opt out.  We will give  warnings if you are not following our rules. If things do not change after those warnings you will be kicked. We also kick if you join our hood and immediately request something without saying hello. We have no rules about trading or selling but we usually will try to save expansion materials for our neighbors. We are a fairly helpful neighborhood. If you demand things items pricing hood status you will be kicked. We are a team! We expect everyone to work together. If this sounds like a neighborhood you would fit into just join! Our hood name is Reddit. Our symbol is a blue circle with a pink pig and our tag is RLVRJAnd we talk to much so we have a discord channel. Will give you the tag Ifwhen you join! Hope to see you soon!! ,HayDay,dgy04m8,3,t5_2vbk7
