Looking at your stats I assume you have a fairly good shot at being able to get some looks but Im sure that at a D it will be harder. Does your school have a keeperspecific coach?

951293,0,t3_24xsbs,Youre palming the ground with Soft ground gloves. Even on grassturf the gloves will rip quickly. IF youre on hard surfaces you might want to look at graphite type latex its more durable but less grippy,GoalKeepers,chcf4oz,1,t5_2u2id
1076443,0,t3_26ev4w,Id say neither go for one of the smooth palm options. Nike do a flat palm and a roll finger cut in that style. Glove companies always produce these types of gloves with over designed palm technology it just seems gimmicky to me. If you look at pro keepers they invariably wear the smooth palm options. The cut is personal preference but the name of the game is getting as much contact with the ball to grip and catch the thing. For all the hype around these fancy options they just dont match the smooth options. I gather your friend is more interested in a good fit than a good grip. Id always prioritise grip before fit but with Nike the roll flat and gunn cuts are all the same basic glove type as the SGT the palms will cause some variance in fit but in broad terms they all fit the same.,GoalKeepers,chqn8gl,2,t5_2u2id

1397473,0,t3_2a3dk0,I just let it go. Every goalkeeper heck every sports person has bad days in his or her career. You shouldnt let it get to you as it happens sometimes and it will happen again. So after the match Ill probably think about it for a while but then realize that theres nothing I can do about it now. Come next training session Ill be on the field doing my best just like every time. Everyone knows people have bad days including your teammates. Its normal. It starts to get worrying if you have them on a regular basis but other than that theres no harm done IMO.TLDR Every athlete has off days look at even Iker Casillas and thats perfectly okay. Dont let it get to you. ,GoalKeepers,cirgctd,3,t5_2u2id
1420531,0,t1_ciu9z39,I agree with you. The main reason for me is because of his situational awareness. He is not afraid to overextend and often prevents a dangerous attack this way.

For the wrist strapping I like a bandage cut that wraps around my full wrist.

4701484,0,t3_3f8o9j,What I do in v situations is I usually try to match the attackers pace. If they are coming in very slow I get set and ready for a shot while moving in very steadily. If you run in here it will be hard to change direction and go in aggressive. Likewise if a striker is charging in full sprint then you better match his pace and get to the damn ball before he does. But whatever you do move forward towards the striker. You sit still while he comes he has a huge goal to hit. You close down that ground and you fill up a lot more of the goal. Just be sure to make sure you are staying between your posts and not giving up any angles. Look at joe harts technique for ideas on how to treat vs with some pace. Id just research for specifics and develop a style that you like and are comfortable withedit and do go out too far that you get chipped thats just annoying and embarrassing ,GoalKeepers,ctn5se5,2,t5_2u2id
4943843,0,t1_cuhbnl7,Thanks for the comments! Theyll be helpful for editing my future videos. Do you use any particular software when you do your editing? I found movie maker to be very timeconsuming and not particularly helpful for things like an instant slowmo after a save  especially if like at  theres something straight after. I might have to invest in a tripod to get a better camera angle. Im a bit restricted by the nets on the goal at the moment and cant fit the whole goal in. I put in a few goal kicks just to see if there were any comments particularly the slowmo one because it looked in real time like I was kicking with a straight leg but youre right I dont think I need lots of help with them. Will take your comments on board for next time. Ive got another one to edit and then whatever I get from this weekend. Thanks again!,GoalKeepers,cuhplsm,2,t5_2u2id

6200191,0,t3_40gsfw,Pretty great. Doubleheader on Friday night indoor against a cupcake team and the league leaders who had only conceded one goal all season.First game we were up  at halftime so the team pulled me and had me play the field  I assisted two goals and scored one at which point I promptly subbed myself off for being gassed. as. fuck. Second game was an hour later just enough time to not really cool down and not really warm up again and we started off hot. Pinned them in their half and scored a quick goal girl scored so it was  points. They responded with a fast break off the kickoff my defense was asleep and they got a  vs me breakaway. I stopped the initial shot but was only able to palm the rebound across the goal where their other striker headed it in.Luckily that goal flipped the switch for my team and we ended up hammering them . ,GoalKeepers,cyue8qk,2,t5_2u2id

6526286,0,t3_44yvwc,I was one of the short keepers. I have some advice.The first thing is to learn to jump. Jump up left right forward and backwards. Im  but because I can jump extremely well I dont get beat very often up high or in the corners. From the centre of the net I can dive well past the post after one to one and a half steps.Second watch a positioning video. I watched one that was from a keeper camp for children. Some of it was review for me but some of it was stuff I didnt know as well. I used the positioning techniques in my  a side game later that week and I felt way more confident. We ended up winning the match   .

6740091,0,t1_d0gg8is,Hmm. When I watch soccer games and they focus in on the keeper many times the gloves look big and bulky like they have extra protection or even spines.

8232057,0,t3_4s0wh2,I can only think of one time Ive ever really lost my cool. It was in a college game vs a team in our conference that we had never lost to in the history of our program. At the time the game was  in the second half. Well the other team scored on a counter attack off a shot that hit the crossbar bounced down into the goal and then back out into the field of play. Now Im  sure that the ball did go completely over the line before bouncing back out of the goal but it wasnt by much. My issue was the AR was about  yards up the field and signaled for the goal. There is no possible that he had any idea if the ball went in or not. I basically went on a tirade yelling at him before even after we had kicked the ball off saying things like  Your  yards away you cant make that call Do your job My teams running for  minutes and you cant make a  yard run? If you cant keep up with this level of play ref youth games. I dont remember getting a yellow card but we did end up losing the game . Sad times.    ,GoalKeepers,d56ka9o,1,t5_2u2id

8686320,0,t3_4yvc47,I used to have a pair of these. In general they are an average glove for multiple reasons The spines prevent you from bending the upper half of your fingers above the knuckle even to a  degree angle forward. This makes it quite difficult to catch balls that come in with any form of pace.  They wear very quickly even if you dive well and land on your hips instead of your hands most Reusch gloves wear quickly.If you can find a version without spines I would definately go for those if you really want Reusch Gloves. ,GoalKeepers,d6rf0l7,2,t5_2u2id

For the level I currently play beer league and coed mainly they are better than I need and priced absolutely right.  High school Classic Elite ODP semipro and college players...  get a pair for your practice gloves if you need some convincing but for most these will do the job and then some.

By game time they are usually a bit damp inside still but the latex is sticky enough that you can press the palms together and they will stick for a few seconds before falling apart.Every pair of gloves I use tend to be a bit different.

11144465,0,t3_5z4dls, draw in BUCS on Wednesday was mixed. We had some uncharacteristic communication failures that lead to both of their goals but I made a few good saves including a recovery after slipping and possibly the best stop Ive ever made. Cross from the left side of the penalty area comes in to their forward unmarked on the edge of the  yard box she volleys it up towards the top right but I explode across and get a good right hand to it. Our coach on the sideline wouldnt shut up about it for the rest of the half! First time anyones ever described a save of mine as unreal and it felt incredible. Played some short  aside games on Saturday. Lost the first one  but played really well. Had a good save high to my left while backpedalling landed it a bit wrong on my lower back and another crazy reflex save that almost felt a bit David Seaman vs Sheffield United getting a hand behind the ball and scooping it away except obviously a bit tamer and less impressive. For their second goal I came charging out to clear a through ball but my defender basically froze after I shouted shes not played with me much before and I pulled out because I didnt want to break her. We won  in the second game against our university rivals development team had little to do apart from a lot of sweeping and a  one on one challenge. In the meantime Ive now signed for a team in the FA WPL. Made my debut as a sub with  to go on Sunday. We were  down and I didnt have a great deal to do besides some collections and sweeping. I made a nice one on one save with my foot that I was very happy with until the ref gave a very delayed penalty. Our defender got confused in the moment and stopped going for the ball because their striker called Ive got it which is definitely not allowed and the ref should have given us a free kick so she pulled her shirt. I went the right way but it was a very good penalty into the bottom corner. I usually wait on penalties and rely on reflexes but at this level its clear I might need to rethink that approach. Overall impressions of the team are very positive. It is a joy to have solid centre backs who are fearless and technically great even if they do have a combined age of about ! Apparently we dominated them when we beat them at home the week before and it did feel like we were unlucky to come away with nothing. ,GoalKeepers,dev7otp,6,t5_2u2id
