2208489,0,t3_2kdsrk,That episode was a bit much on the emotional spectrum and a bit heartbreaking to watch the end animated.,grisaia,clkjx06,2,t5_32g1k
2438735,0,t3_2nck5o,WinneonSword is right. Once you complete any good ending you can see CGs scene replays movie replays and a BGM gallery. Only imagesscenesmoviestracks that youve experienced show up. ing the game gives you obviously everything.,grisaia,cmd4szv,2,t5_32g1k
2663568,0,t1_cn5r8vq,Im guessing its something like that. Bottom has mother and kill. Top one has self and kill,grisaia,cn696vo,2,t5_32g1k
2738224,0,t1_cnf7o8k,No problem the common route is quite long and there is quite a bit of character developement no worries. Overall Amane Makina and Sachis routes are the most liked by the community so they should be a good read.,grisaia,cnfbope,2,t5_32g1k

5515755,0,t1_cwginzm,Im honestly not sure why but my favorite outside the main five is actually Chizuru...... and she gets two bonus scenes in Meikyuu,grisaia,cwgorwo,1,t5_32g1k

10333018,0,t1_dcbefx2,gt Im honestly not sure what character I like the most. Its probably Kazuki is there anything more of her?Do you really want me to answer that?  They deliberately set Kajitsu up to call into question whether Kazuki is dead or not.  Ill apply this answer to your last question as well.gt Also finished Makinas route. Preeeetty sure it was the true ending.Which ending would that be.  I imagine youre probably right but just to confirm.gt I will say that I kind of disliked the whole arm thing with Yuuji considering thats what edgy teenagers like to say. I guess that makes it more in character but at least at the end there was some nice symbolization.True but I think Yuuji had plenty of excuse to be edgy.  Everything isnt made clear in Kajitsu but in Meikyuu youll see why hes so messed up.,grisaia,dcfaztu,1,t5_32g1k
