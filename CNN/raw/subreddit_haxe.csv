I wasnt successful in trying to make sense of the code before but the new docs now seem to cover everything I tried to tackle.Great job by Jason and all of the contributors. Looking forward to using Ufront again soon!,haxe,crq2ztj,1,t5_2qlah

You wouldnt be able to do that with nonmacro code the date would simply be the date when the user booted the game up each time.,haxe,ctww1a0,1,t5_2qlah
