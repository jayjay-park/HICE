11478573,0,t1_dfx1rpx,People around here know me by Kin. he called back hands still raised. His right hand quivered a little ready to flash into his duster where his . was holstered at the first sign of hostility. And youre right. But shooting that gun off of yours at night with a nice big campfire going is also a nice way to bring in some curious raiders. You gotta be careful out here maam. Kin walked into the circle of light cast by the fire fully visible to the whole caravan now. Like I said sounds like you all could use an extra pair of eyes tonight. Im just looking for a place to warm my feet and get a little shut eye. Kin turned his palms up as if to ask them whats next?,Fallout_RP,dfx3caw,1,t5_3jrfi

11551927,0,t3_64udnu,Kin leaned in closer to the old ham radio he had found in the upstairs attic of his newly liberated home. The static littered with what sounded like disjointed words....anyone...some hel....cell...know...strong...stations...broken...oh no...please...help meThat poor bastard thought Kin. He had been scanning the radio waves looking for information anything that might give him a lead towards supplies that would help him get out of the Mojave when he came across this transmission. Over the next two days he periodically would tune back to the frequency each time able to make out different parts of the  message as it came through the static. Regardless he couldnt even begin to figure out where this guy was located or why he should even bother. He tried replying but either the mouthpiece of his radio was broken or the static was distorting his voice too much.Kin tried one last time Hey you still alive over there?,Fallout_RP,dg5exbg,2,t5_3jrfi
