5553413,0,t1_cwlep8q,Although you have a point but it feels like iPhone in analogy. Lets say one day iPhone become something else rather than retaining its current functionality would you still like iPhone now even when you once like it? I know of some people who are turned off by the new design of iPhone  saying s design is better. So basically what Im saying is that change may be necessary but certain things are better left unchanged such as music. Like if jay become a dancing king like show one day what would you think even if it is an improvement over his current self? Reminds me of how jolin changed so much amongst all artist that I get turned off now watching her or even listening to her songs.,cpop,cwlg9dy,0,t5_2sekg
