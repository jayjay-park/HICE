7625301,0,t3_4j49vz,So what I did after spending a few hours trying to figure out the encoding method by hand was to convert each of the  examples into  AZ pairs represented a few different ways. I shoved those into a simple mlp and after what Im sure is a horrific example of overfitting it correctly classified them. From there I just started generating random values and if the network classified them as belonging to the group with the correct  values I saved them and posted as many as reddit would allow me in a single post.I figured I had two ways to win either the network actually figured out your method and was giving me valid results or the network failed but the number of correct values was large enough that my posting a few thousand codes would score three hits anyway. Unfortunately the rules changed from defining winning as the first person to post three codes to requiring an additional explanation of the encoding mechanism which makes posting three additional examples rather pointless.At this point its been several days and theres no further activity on this. I expect in part because there is no shortage of solve my code posts to work on. Are you generating these encodings by hand? Do you know out of the  possible values how many are valid and how many are invalid? That would be interesting information. Also if youre able posting a much larger set of validinvalid values could spark some additional interest.,CracktheCode,d38yf81,3,t5_344xj
