8975633,0,t1_d7qq18b,gt Indeed intoxicants... are filth from the work of satan so stay away from him to be successful. Doesnt say anything about intoxicants in small and large amounts.Exactly. Leaving the hadith to the side for the moment and focusing on just the Quran then the verse you quoted above means you cant eatdrink the food I mentioned. Right?gt Not all intoxicants are wine there are other types of intoxicants.Exactly. Again. Sorry for repeat but that just means you cant have what I mentioned. Because technically theyre intoxicants you mentioned bread for instance. Which means theyre haraam.If it feels like Imm antagonising Id like to take this moment to apologise. I really wanna know but have all these questions.,Quraniyoon,d7qqh3e,1,t5_3g813

Whats funny is that evolution certainly does not eliminate God. Yeah I read that article. Thanks for sharing ,Quraniyoon,d8eyhun,1,t5_3g813
9266162,0,t1_d8qjo82,Oh I didnt know what IANAQ meant. Wait you think the Quran is pretty calm with the Kuffar?,Quraniyoon,d8qjvpf,1,t5_3g813
9267436,0,t1_d8nt5mr,gt Quran has the protection of Allah gt and hadith doesnt have that protectionBrother NOWHERE in the Quran it says that only the Quran is protected by ALLAH. It says that ALDHIKRthe reminder is protected  .The Taurat the Injil and THE BOOK are also referred to as dhikr in   and . So then the Taurat and the Injil must also have been protected per  and ALL of ALLAHs revelations must have been protected whether inside or outside of the Quran including ALLAHs revelations to the Prophet outside the Quran as explained below.If you confine  only to the Quran it also becomes a logical fallacy of circular reasoning or begging the questiongt i do follow him with the Quran you follow his pathThe Quran also tells you that ALLAHs revelations are not confined ONLY to the Quran but can be found outside the Quran as well . There were revelations to the Prophet outside the Quran also as proven from the Quran itself        . So to follow and obey the Messenger you have to follow ALL of ALLAHs revelations called hadith by the Quran   both inside and outside of the Quran.gtQuran explain himselfgtAnd We have revealed the Book to you which has clear explanation of everything and a guidance mercy and good news for those who submit. NOWHERE in the Quran does it say that the Quran has clear explanation of everything. It says THE BOOK has clear explanation of everything. According to  and many other verses like      THE BOOK is not the same as the Quran but the Quran and other revelations of ALLAH outside the Quran including Taurat Injil ALLAHs revelations outside the Quran to the Prophet are a subsetpart of THE BOOK.The Quran might have the details tafsil but does not have the clear explanation bayan of ALL the details. Only THE BOOK has the clear explanation of ALL things. The Quranists have a habit of confusing tafsil with bayan as if they are the same thing.gt cause allah gave to mankind his ability of thinking  AQLThe classical Arabic dictionaries are also hadith outside the Quran. So to reject ALL hadith outside the Quran you will have to reject the classical Arabic dictionaries as well and then no matter how much AQL you use you wont even be able to properly understand many things in the Quran.Additionally the diacritical marks were not in the original written Quranic manuscripts. The same word can have entirely different meaning if you change the diacritical marks. The way to pronounce the words as per the diacritical marks was transmitted orally just like other hadith were transmitted. THIS IS A FACT. No matter how much AQL you use you have to rely on the hadith of the diacritical marks to understand the Quran.gt some say its mention in the Quran  times and some say  times ?The Quranists have been debating extensively for many many years about the number of salat. The opinions range between   and  times and they havent been able to have a consensus on such a basic matter yet. If the Quran has clear explanation of everything like you claim which it doesnt as shown above then the Quranists should have been able to reach consensus on a certain number by now.gt  How do you know how to fast?gt only in Sunni wayThe Quranists also have been debating extensively for many many years about when to fast and how many days to fast and they have not been able to have consensus on these matters as well. They also do not know how to fast on the North and South poles according to the Quran. If the Quran has clear explanation of everything like you claim which it doesnt as shown above then the Quranists should have been able to reach consensus on these matters by now.gt but i do now follow only the QuranNowhere in the Quran does it promote the Quran only but it promotes ALLAH alone        . ALLAHs revelations are found both inside and outside of the Quran including ALLAHs revelations to the Prophet outside the Quran as proven above therefore the Quran is not the only source of guidance for muslims.In  the people of the Injil who must have included some muslims also per  were not asked to judge only by the Quran but were asked to judge by the Injil even in the presence of the Quran. This also proves that the original Injil containing ALLAHs revelations must have been preserved at that time and I think manuscripts of that Injil not translations survive to this day.,Quraniyoon,d8qpp13,1,t5_3g813
9607518,0,t1_d9mqq71,Zakat as used in the Quran means purificationbetterment and is not limited to just charity as someone here seems to imply but can be atoobrought forth by establishing salat giving sadaqatcharity or any good deed   If tax is given to an islamic government in accordance with  i.e.  percent then in my understanding it will lead to atoobringing forth zakat just like salat giving sadaqatcharity or any good deed will lead to atoobringing forth zakat. Tax given to a nonislamic government wont qualify. Just my opinion.,Quraniyoon,d9xbn4q,1,t5_3g813
