If Parsons had something plastic or rubber with him from our world like his sneakers when he was first ported to give them an example of rubber then a dollamancer might be able to make wire insulation.   In a pinch woven fiber could be used like they did prior to the s.,erfworld,d147k9b,1,t5_2taxz

7349501,0,t3_4fzgak,With Dons every word being nails on the chalkboard to his Chief Powderkeg and now his longloyal Thinkamancer frowning behind his back as he talks I cant help but feel that theres a Parsonesque loophole gambit quietly falling into place for Caesar. Given how willing and vigilant Don is to disband him it seems like something needs to come out of left field for Caesars arc to amount to anything other than being disbanded in midair in an all too obvious end.I think that something is going to hinge on my assumption here one of the usuallypointless nuances of the tricky prisoner rules Commanders dont lose their ability to propose and accept offers to Turn to their side. Its just losing a battle and ending up in shackles usually gives every reason for that to go the opposite way.Caesars got an enemy commander  actually whos already been talking about an alliance in his dungeon. His problematic King has already made it clear he wants an audience with that commander for yet another round of pontificating and showing off to his court and these never seem to end well.... If anything of this sort happens I think it will come from Bunny and Caesar will hate it at first but heres my guessBunny and Caesar broker a deal with Parson Caesar formally offers to turn to GK and Parson abstains from replying at the time. Don gets his audience and when hes finally ready to let Parson talk all he hears is I formally accept your offer to turn before he sees a differentlyclad Caesar and a newly repatriated Parson coming his way not unlike how Jillian got back in business by taming Cwapsack as a fugitive in Book . Bunny does crowd control for any other shocked warlords in attendance seems like Caesar basically had unanimous support for defying Don back during the battle of Spacerock so shell manage. Whatevers going on with Maggie and Bills psychic war maybe shell be there to do something about the Dolls in Dons personal guard. Jack is of course invited to attend to make things interesting as well.One giant mess later GKs newest warlord spins off by claiming their newest capital site and an alliance is born. Not a clean start for Transylvito v I think that if Don falls without an heir all units in the capital would need to surrender to GK so that Caesar can claim the site or else its a contested hex and they cant leave the city without a side. All field units would disband RIP but Caesar can probably justify orders to recall most back to cities and I believe all of their cities would get frozen in time so thats a rush to go tag them back in before Carpool et al. pokes around. Vinny might be a problem hes definitely not going out because of something like this but maybe he just automatically becomes a prisoner of FAQ if hes in one of their cities when his side falls.Or maybe Charlie has a few more wrenches to throw in before any of this becomes possible glad to see the story is finally getting around to this conflict.,erfworld,d2dl6f9,8,t5_2taxz
8473577,0,t1_d60q4dw,Problem from there Without Don or Caesar the side ceases to be. No side no portal. No portal no escape until start of turn restores move. Meanwhile all of TVs field units would have depoped but units in cities dont. You wouldnt be safe until the entire enemy force has been routed or turned. Units turning in this scenario might be something of a snowball effect but its still a pretty bleak outlook. ,erfworld,d60qlet,6,t5_2taxz
