The bridesmaids gowns are of ivory silk tulle with a tight fitting bodice gathered tulle shirred down the center front and shoulders are swathed with pearl spotted tulle bordered with a delicate trail of appliqu white satin syringa. The bouffant Victorian skirt of the billowing white tulle is scattered with clusters of syringa flowers in appliqu satin embroidered especially to repeat a similar effect to the embroidery on the bridal train of Princess Elizabeth.
