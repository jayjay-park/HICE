10948768,0,t3_5vqtaw,Finally got around to watching this episode  and what an episode! As usual Ill share my thoughts below. So this is who Cardinal has been giving the cash too and we learn its clean money to boot! Dumping Woodys body right where they threw Keiths missing digit wasnt exactly the brightest idea.  We got him. Finally everything clicks into place. The guitar and the necklace. Chills. Now that theyve found the pivotal clue everything falls into place. What an incredible sequence! The tracking shot as they comb the abandoned school and as Cardinal pursues Eric back through it was thrilling. There was tension and suspense around every corner. Damn Eric gets off easy and checks himself out. It would have been satisfying to have him see all his plans crumble around him but life is rarely that karmic. Double damn! What sympathy I had for Edie began to dissipate when she repeatedly yelled for Eric to shoot Woody and it faded even further with her stabbing Keith.While Im not this episode was the best one it was certainly the most heartpumping! The Pine investigation really revved up while Delormes investigation cooled a little but the major arcs of the series seem to be moving towards an inevitable conclusion. I cant wait to take in the series finale with the rest of you this coming Wednesday!,CardinalTV,de9adji,1,t5_3irgn
