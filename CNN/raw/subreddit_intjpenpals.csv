2267808,0,t3_2l0uw9,M Utah. Studying business management and potentially going to law school! I love organizing and dividing my life into manageable chunks. Love creative games like minecraft and making games for other people! My idea of the purpose of everyones life is to ask questions find answers and act accordingly. I have my stuff together and dont need much to be content and happy. I figured Id let you know more about me and let you decide if I sound interesting enough rather than force myself upon you! ,intjpenpals,cls0rck,1,t5_31enw
