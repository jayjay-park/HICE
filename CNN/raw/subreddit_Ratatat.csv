3098671,0,t1_coixvww,Thanks for showing some interest lol It took me about  and a half hours because I had to listen to each song multiple times to capture albeit vaguely the tone of each song. I got the idea one song at a time. I didnt have a clue where it was going to go when I started writing it but once I started writing I noticed similarities and nuances between songs which helped me form a story arch or at least a jumping off point for the next song. I also took a page from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind if youve seen it you know what I mean. I tried to incorporate the environmental sounds they had in their songs and to an extent the dialogue as well. ,Ratatat,coj6cek,1,t5_2t8ti

4575845,0,t1_ct5k0wb,Its just perplexing giving the scope of Pitchfork these days that theyd leave the review of a Ratatat album to some who gives no fucks about them at all. I find it hard to believe there wasnt someone more suitable to review it unless they chose it from a pool of reviews to serve their common agenda of downplaying established bands because its not  trendy. See Radiohead or Queens of The Stone Age Taken without context the ratings arent necessarily ridiculous but when you look and see what they willingly dole out ungodly ratings for its a bit silly. I like that album a lot but  is a bit absurd its not perfect at all.,Ratatat,ct7e5t2,1,t5_2t8ti
