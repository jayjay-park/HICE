9601023,0,t3_5bcrmi,I bought these cases and couldnt be happier especially at the price point.Its a  pack and is a knock off of the teamhtc cases that were sent out a couple weeks ago. Its a different brand but as far as I can tell they are exactly the same. Without the teamhtc of course I have both for reference. They arent slippery and provide a medium protection. Im really picky with cases I dont like cases that make the phone feel huge or distract from the screen quality. This does neither. It fits like a glove too.But honestly. You cant go too wrong for .pair. Also here is the same case as the free ones that were sent out by HTC. also without the teamhtc on the back. P.s. sorry Im  days late to the thread.,HTC10,d9witej,1,t5_3cxt5
9750112,0,t3_5esnof,Pixel is the sensible direct upgrade to your N. You can expect improvement in every single aspect you can think of. That being said HTC  is like the Pixel cousin with more flare  the design is much more interesting slightly larger in footprint better audio prodigy and runs on a minimally bloated firmware. ,HTC10,daewyz7,8,t5_3cxt5

10284218,0,t3_5n8lu6,Own the V. It has its uses but is mostly gimmicky. The music controls when the phone is off are mostly useless since the aod mode will automatically go back on after a few seconds. If I have to swipe a tiny display for my controls how is that more convenient than turning the phone on? The multi task reel is nice but nougat allowing you to instantly switch to your last used app makes the multi task reel almost completely useless to me. The extra apps on top are cool but the phone is huge and the nd display is on top so I dont use em often since its a chore to reach the top of the phone. Overall Id much rather have a headphone jack.                ,HTC10,dc9rtrn,1,t5_3cxt5

11066459,0,t3_5xzxx9,I believe it is because of Nougat sadly. A friend of mine who has a Sony Z Compact said the same thing that fingerprint sensor became too fast after Nougat update. I have read mentions about this on other phones too.Developers may be able to fix by adding a delay but on default fingerprint sensor is extremely fast. I havent checked but Google may have done something about this in . or ...,HTC10,demdfcv,1,t5_3cxt5

11437691,0,t1_dfsfqe0,I personally havent bought a used phone but if the price is right and youre comfortable with the condition you should go for it. Only risk is that the price for brand new ones drops significantly in the next month or so to less than what you paid on the Mint one. Depends on how much patience you have. Sounds like youve been waiting for a while though so it might be time to pull the trigger. ,HTC10,dfsg99s,2,t5_3cxt5
