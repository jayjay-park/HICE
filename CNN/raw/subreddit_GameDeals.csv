If I list a card at . which is high enough to be buried by about  pages of slightly cheaper cards and thus not sell then Im more likely to forget about it.Theres also cards sitting in inventories that will be forgotten. Yes those people could dump their cards at the last minute to get whatever price they can but I just dont think that the overall number of people dumping cards at low prices will outnumber the people buying up cards at low prices. There were plenty of people buying cards en masse when they were . each just so they could boost their Steam level and that was back when it was pretty obvious that the cards would plummet in price eventually because they had already started to.

31745,0,t1_cei1acx,Well maybe it didnt affect you but whenever Amazon pricematched another store which they did very often I would make my purchase on Amazon since the credit was a bonus that was not offered elsewhere. Basically Amazon used an incentive to get people to buy from their own store promising more deals in January that the coupons could be applied on. Im sure many people assumed the deals precoupon would be similar to those during December. Now seeing the deals people are upset because they could have easily spent their money on other stores that they may prefer to use over Amazon. This seems to be a successful yet somewhat scummy move on Amazons part to get people to spend most of their holiday sale budget on their store and then convince them to spend even more money in January since customers will have  credits that they wont want to go to waste while offering deals that are subpar by this subreddits standards.That said Im not ready to be angry yet since there very well could be some great deals coming up throughout the month.,GameDeals,cei1ntg,11,t5_2qwx3

139708,0,t1_ceub451,Hey thereTrying to catch all the your questions let me know if I missed any. I create a new post when we have deals launch and I see they are selling well.  . The things on the EC list remain on the EC list meaning the  coupon will work on them throughout January. The price promotions like SimCity at . or . post coupon are not lasting all month nor have I communicated that they would. It would be unreasonable for pubsdevs to discount AAA titles aggressively for a  day period and I wouldnt ever suggest or promote that. Edit to clarify here what I mean is I dont think Ive ever seen a retailer run a AAA Title is  off for the entire month of ltinsert month heregt promotion.. Again see point . Weve never run a sale where prices are aggressively discounted for  days nor am I aware of any retailer or publisher that has done so.. We dont have any plans for a recap although most of the deals were seeing lots of redemption on have repeated or are going to again.Hope this helps!  CheersTony,GameDeals,ceuccdz,2,t5_2qwx3

The technology tree is semirandomized each game  you have a weighted chance each game to learn Shield technology for example and this chance is different depending on your race. Further each race has a unique means of FTL travel so they expand through the galaxy in different patterns and at different rates.

189314,0,t1_cezg4d2,Cmon now it didnt play like Gears of War whatsoever and went full bore on an arcade scoring systems and a ridiculous kill system matched by equally ridiculous scripted sequences.Its writing was dumb and juvenile which suited the shoot a dude with mineskick him into the sky and then hit him with a drill gameplay perfectly the games biggest downfall was the hide behind cover health regeneration at odds with the pace and superaggressive gameplay and the story unevenly putting on a serious face at times. Oh and GFWL.DNF wasnt half the game it was even if its own brand of juvenile dumbshit might up be someone elses alley more than Bulletstorm. It wasnt oldschool DND nor was it a good throwback late s or mid to late s shooter either. Theres little to nothing that game does well.

I wonder how long this sale will end up being because once the more popular games start going up it could easily be like  hours per game.

254559,0,t1_cf74c6l, hours into Civ  for me and youre never close to beating it... these are the type of games you could literally play forever. I can see wanting to get at Civ  for nostalgia or maybe because they have a very low end computer that cant run  but  is the pinnacle of the series in terms of detailed micromanaged gameplay. From a business perspective they dont really lose by including  and  in the bundle too. These games have completely run their course and probably are selling next to no copies these days. If helps the rest of the bundle look more attractive I guess that work too. This is real just a way for them to milk a few extra dollars out of Civ  and sell more people on the BNW expansion. ,GameDeals,cf751qt,1,t5_2qwx3

418856,0,t1_cfnqhec,I wholeheartedly agree. It was a very dull experience for me and my girlfriend very repetitive and playing any class besides the archer felt suicidal because of the cheapness of the mobs constantly getting hit because of the range in which you need to attack them as all the nonarcher classes and the poor telegraphing of mob attacks.As time progresses you just feel like a hindrance to the person who is playing the archer since you share livesand if youre the melee class I believe it was the Paladin then prepare to lose all your partys lives within the first level.It made me frustrated because I went in expecting a really fun multiplayer hacknslash like Gauntlet Legends with a more old school Gauntlet aesthetic and feel but it was not meant to be.Though I did not try it with more people. It is probably fun in a four player LAN setup but two player localcouch coop felt cramped and annoying.

Having said that the community is generally good and finding a good group to play with isnt too hard. Worst case scenario is if someone isnt up to scruff you can just explain that you need a higher level player and either ask them to leave or kick them again not without explanation.

When Sims  comes itll probably still cost a lot due to many people not having good enough computers for Sims  and if they see Sims  for cheap they might get it instead which is something EA doesnt want. Not that I know for sure they might also go for selling TS for cheap but have the DLC for full price which means theyd still get a lot money from that.Then again most of the hardcore Sims players probably already have the game and all the DLC they want.,GameDeals,cfrybq8,11,t5_2qwx3

492017,1,t3_1zqiht,I dont understand the love for this game.  I backed it on Kickstarter with the hope and expectation of a game that captured the essence of old Lucasarts adventure games.  What I got was a game that barely had anything that could be called a puzzle and that only really makes a halfhearted attempt at the wit and humor of the classics.

534247,0,t1_cg0z9w0,gt I just hate it when theyll throw one in after a boss or something and if you fail it you have to fight them again. Not cool.That reminds me of Splatterhouse I can remember at least one boss fight that did exactly that. Failure to properly execute a time sensitive QTE at the very end of the fight resulted in an instant death and having to reload a checkpoint just before the boss fight. Im curious who genuinely thinks thats a good idea. Sure give the boss a little HP back and make me finish it again not restart the entire encounter.Pretty sure that killed what little I was enjoying of the game as the memory sticks out pretty strongly haha.,GameDeals,cg1017c,1,t5_2qwx3

842317,0,t1_cgzyc8s,I definitely agree with you on the doubleedged nature of their chosen DLC model. I actually talked myself into grabbing the game during the last GMG sale since I figured it was pretty much a now or never scenario if I waited much longer too much DLC would be out and Id definitely not want to bother with it. Also didnt hurt that I paid for the entire thing with Playfire credits and it came with the color pack so Im just missing Squigly.Its awesome that theyre wanting to give the DLC away free mainly for those who supported the crowdfunding but it benefits everyone who owns it so even better. However looking at the final price after all DLC is released and no longer free were talking  base game   DLC  characters at  each   color pack for a total cost of  for those late adopters who dont find the game on sale. Kinda crazy to pay twice the cost of the game for the additional DLC and considering its practically  of the roster its even more of a bummer.I think my main concern is games generally get cheaper over time and this one seems to be doing the opposite which doesnt seem like the best decision for the game and the community in the long run. Hopefully they do plan on doing some sort of package that or more sales in the future would be nice especially on the DLC.Edit And now look at that the Squigly DLC and color pack are currently  off on Steam,GameDeals,ch00vpo,4,t5_2qwx3

Id bought the Collectors Edition comes with level editing tools on launch day and was so sorely disappointed after UTK.

1048101,0,t1_chn2lgg,gt  For starters you only get that battery life when its on economy mode. That mode is fine for most everyday use but if you play FPS games or anything its not enough.In my experience ... this is incorrect.First of all you get  hours in performance mode I certainly did and economy mode gives over  hours. sourceG offers two distinct operating modesPerformance and Endurance. Performance mode gives you up to  hours of battery life without losing any gaminggrade capabilities. When not gaming use Endurance mode to extend the battery life for up to an impressive  hours.gtbut if you play FPS games or anything its not enough.Again I disagree.

1170010,0,t1_ci0r1hr,Yes I did. Thanks for the reply totally forgot. Just got off work again. The game doesnt include any Online Multiplayer at the moment took it out due to poor response from the previous title and they also took out Tournament Mode. I truly thought the online multiplayer specially the supercross was pretty fun. They only have this now for local coop. So basically got my hopes extremely high for the game. Thought it was going to blow the previous editions out of the water and it turns out to be basically a remake with a different theme and less modes.,GameDeals,ci18vut,1,t5_2qwx3

If we want to cherrypick lets compare prices for MvC.   characters for  equates to approximately . per character.What bothers me is the fact that  characters isnt enough to for most fighting games.  Skullgirls has the tag team mechanic to spice the meta game up but thats still a disappointing number.  Then add on  character packs?You can try to validate the value all you want.  Ill spend  for a balanced fighting game that has a diverse roster of characters over a cheaper alternative with less characters.

1285488,0,t1_cie4vv5,Bought it at full price. Im a huge fan of Platinum and Im incredibly glad that they brought it to PC. I dont get to see very many spectacle fighters on PC too often. After coming off of Bayonetta and the DMC HD trilogy on consoles and the DmC reboot on PC Im pretty glad the PC got something like this. I played through it twice and checked out the surprisingly lengthy DLC campaigns and thought that it was well worth the  let alone .If youre not a fan of the genre and if you lack a gamepad you can probably let this one go. Ive never played a Metal Gear Solid game but that didnt affect my enjoyment too much. If you happen to have a console you can download the demo to see if the mechanics work for you.

I never really made it that far everything just felt bland and repetitive like the combat system. It rips off Arkham Asylum type of combat although youre a bit more invested in the combos. Generally youre just gonna use the same combo to pummel the same enemy youve been seeing for a while.The whole point of the game was to remix memories aka changing the persons mind because youre a dick which couldve been better but it didnt and there wasnt much to play around with it. Great art direction but theres no point if the story and the mindnumbing gameplay falls flat. ,GameDeals,cihgteb,8,t5_2qwx3

1316703,0,t1_cihov1o,As an fan of the series particularly VI and VII I can mostly agree with the bit about leveling. Most encounters in the game are scaled to your level so you wont as much of a difference as you level up as you would in many other games. Leveling up does change the enemy drops and eventually you can gain the ability to manipulate enemy levels to change the drops andor difficulty.However I will disagree with a couple other points Limit breaks do seem to be referred to pretty heavily in VIII but they existed before then. Here is a video detailing the limit breaks in FFVI where they were first introduced as a hidden feature called desperation attacks.The Ifrit mission you mentioned if I remember the story correctly is set up as a test of your judgement. You get to choose the amount of time you think youll need to finish the mission the ability to judge your own ability fairly and correctly is an important quality in a SeeD cadet.All that said Yes. Its quite different from most FF titles. I love the game but I wouldnt go into it expecting the traditional JRPG formula.,GameDeals,cihqvcb,2,t5_2qwx3

CK is a medieval familydynasty simulator where you try and gain as much power as you can through alliances marriages treachery conquests etc. Its a much more personalized game as you take the role of a character and then their childrenheirs and so on and so on. Its a lot of fun its my highest played Steam game over  hours although I have at least double that if you factor in the hours I played with the Iron Price version of the game.... Empire Total War is a fun battle game but Id recommend CK over it. Heck I think Id prefer Napolean Total War over Empire as its a lot more stable in just about every way. Not to mention that the campaign on Empire is buggy as hell and slower than molasses at least for me on the two gaming laptops Ive owned which are pretty wellequipped to handle it. ,GameDeals,cii68hi,1,t5_2qwx3

War within your own lands? Magical forces closing in on you? People challenging you to a duel?Youre a Princess on her way to becoming a Queen and DEATH IS EVERYWHERE.seriouslyI put a good three or so hours into it and enjoyed it a lot. All you do is plan your week of activitiesclasses and make choices during certain dialogues but goddamn every little thing you do will affect you later on. The only reason I stopped playing was because I had real classes and I unfortunately never got around to playing again.  Its a very entertaining game that can branch off to many paths many of which end with you dying in a variety of ways but with a cute lighthearted picture at the end so its all good.Cuteness aside though the political interaction with people is pretty cool. Lot of people are going to want to marry you off and alliances can be made and broken. You have no idea about the power and responsibilities of being a Queen but youre gonna learn them quick. You can shape the queen how you want depending on what youve had her learn. Not every decision or choice is lifedeath although many are so it doesnt quickly degrade into a trial and error game. In the end it kinda is but its so damn fun. The whole Mood system also makes planning your activities very strategic since some work better when youre angry and others when youre happy but then you have to decide whether those Mood bonus increasesdecreases matter when intense shit is going down.The only real con I can see with this game is that the game isnt random everything that happens is preset. Yes there are some branching paths of sorts but if you replay the game youll be expecting a lot of the events. At least this is how I feel like replaying the game might be. I still havent beaten it myself so Im only speculating. TLDR It has unique but simple mechanics that you can be strategic with but it stays enjoyable and its well worth ..,GameDeals,ciido22,15,t5_2qwx3

I never bought the game when it first came out so I didnt mind paying a little bit more to get it on my PS having it look better and get some extra content. The selling point for the Definitive Edition is the better graphics though hence why it was only released on PS and XBOne. You can already get this level of graphics on a PC. Plenty of people havent played the game yet or would like to play it on their new consoles so its not as though theres no market for it and not having to pay for  worth of DLC is nice for lazy people like me. Its like a Game of the Year  multigen edition IMO.,GameDeals,cimoh4a,1,t5_2qwx3

1360673,0,t1_cimstg8,About gameplay In survival mode you start in one of many scenarios which you choose going from a fully equiped based with already pre made ships to a shipwreck with some resources to being in an empty space. Also you can adjust many thing like number of things floting in space difficulty which defines the number and frequency of meteor showers size of the map etc. Once you start you have tools that will help you collect resources to start creating things gold iron etc which you obtain by mining asteroids. Also if you are playing survival you must charge your suit to survive so you must craft energy sources and medic bays to keep your basic abilities working jetpack lights drills. Now into the main feature of the game Building Ships. After you have resources and stablished a base you craft the parts needed to start like hull doors pilot seats energy source thrusters gyroscops. Be careful since the ships and buildings follow Newtonian Laws so if you collide with a ship you are building and you dont have any of the main systems your ship will go flying away. You can build small ships which have First person view and third person and big ships which only have third person. There are turrets to defend your ship from meteor showers if in SP or from other ships if in MP. Other parts are landing gears gravity generators connectors crates drills saws missile launchers and gatling guns.Another important thing is to mention the destructible environments when you are minign you actually get to pick the rock of the mineral. Collisions between ships are amazing. Still early Access and regular updates make this game great because developers are pretty active within the community and the game is pretty functional in this state.,GameDeals,cimum6u,14,t5_2qwx3

1369682,0,t1_ciny4c8,You are using a lot of words to say that youre scared of reddit becoming overrun with shills. Firstly this sub isnt overrun. Reps arent shills. They are explicitly known and referred to as representatives of their company. Shills are representatives who pose as unaffiliated people. Mod teams are expected to keep a handle on shill attempts regardless of what their sub is about. There is no difference between your catastrophizing about rgamedeals turning into a shill wasteland and someone catastrophizing about raskreddit turning into a shill wasteland youre just giving undue focus on this sub because the content being curated involves advertisements. I shouldnt even address this point because I addressed it in my last post but like I said you are inventing a magical dystopian reddit future where shills run the planet and Im a shill and youre a shill and were being shilled by shilly shillers. If a mod gets paid off users will just point it out and theyll be banned like always. Nothing is stopping mods from being shills currently the absolute maximum amount of trouble that it has caused is a few shadow bans. What are you paranoid about? This entire fixation on losing control is absurd. Second these advertisements are desired by this community. I want to know when a new bundle comes out and I want to know whats in it who made it how much its going for if there are any lower prices and so forth. Its literally the reason I am here. Pretending like that information can reach my eyeballs in the exact same way by reddit users as by reps is disingenuous and you know it. I follow deals on products I want almost religiously because I dont always have money to buy shit new and nobodynobodydelivers deals in a timely manner. I miss deals constantly from people failing to update their listssites in time for me to nab it. A lot of sites offer unpublicized deals hidden deals deals you cant just visit their site to see. Even the steam sale has hidden deals that you would never find without a public forum of people collecting their individual information for the benefit of all. This process is made much much more simple with the inclusion of reps to point those less visible deals out. Finally what this boils down to is money. As you said a subreddit with free advertisements is a subreddit that takes away from the potential advertising revenue for reddit admins. Everything else you said is completely irrelevant to this facet of the issue. Reddit wants money from advertisers and it does not give a single shit how the community feels about the matter. ,GameDeals,cinz7sg,3,t5_2qwx3

Easily one of the best games of the previous generation and my personal favorite stealth game since Thief .  The story is great dont listen to the complaints.  Theres nothing wrong with the story it has a fantastic Clive Barkerish setting decent twists and turns well written and voiced characters and it does a fantastic job of making you have emotional reactions to whats going on.  Daud is also one of the best characters from video games as a whole last generation Michael Madsen did a great job bringing him to life.One big strength of the game is how many ways you can play it.  You can sneak past everything never killing or knocking out anyone except a couple assassination targets you have to deal with.  You can knock out everyone you meet leaving piles of sleeping bodies one other minor issue with the game is that it only holds about  bodies per area at a time killing or knocking out further NPCs will just make bodies despawn you can mod this though.

1481176,0,t1_cj1qw8q,A couple of points The Mojave is dangerous and youre not intended to book it straight to the Strip. Unlike the theme park of Fallout  just because the world is open doesnt mean everywhere in the world is safe. Having said that... You can make it to the Strip from Goodsprings though sneaking and with careful patience but the trek there is intended to introduce you to the world and various factions. Im disappointed that you quit there though as that occurs in like the first  minutes of the game. After that initial trek the Wasteland is pretty much wideopen though dont ever expect Deathclaws to be pushovers You do get an opportunity to reset your faction status in the context of the game not too far into the game. ,GameDeals,cj1xvyl,3,t5_2qwx3

1683803,0,t1_cjr449z,The first Disgaea is a great starting point because it introduces a lot of the starting themes and introduces the characters that carry the storyline in the newest title that came out for the PS.  You can literally if you felt inclined to save yourself time skip straight from Hour of Darkness to the newest title and you would not be really missing any storyAs the following games between those two use different characters for the most part different storylines and merely improve on the alreadygreat ingame mechanics....So thats why its a great starting point. It allows you to continue the series if you want to skip a few games or if you want to just play right through them all. Disgaea Hour of Darkness is a game so good that when I sold my Ps and game collection it was one of the first games I immediately bought again when getting a Ps for a second time later in college. The story is great. The characters are absurdly loveable. It sets the tone for the following gamesAnd it is a gorgeous D Tacticsstyle RPG. If Final Fantasy Tactics for the Playstation One was the This is hands down the best Tactics Game. for that system because of how much it pioneered that genre Disgaea Hour of Darkness is the the ultimate Tactics game I would say for the Playstation Two. It revolutionized the way that genre was done by improving vastly on the mechanics of the game. ,GameDeals,cjremyy,4,t5_2qwx3

The game gets better and better with each patch just like Diablo  but it still has problems to be solved and balancing to be done before Id recommend it wholeheartedly.

1794682,0,t1_ck5cv1y,Think of it this way. When you kickstart a project your providing them with funding in exchange for possible future benefits. This normally comes in the form of a preorder with bonuses or possibly a discounted price. Now there are kickstarted games which have large sale discounts soon after release negating some of the benefits. Especially in cases like this where the game is still in early access which means they are not theoretically done yet and its already priced as PWYW meaning the backers are can be seen to have overpaid or have been overcharged for the same thing they could get now.A non kickstarter example would be if you were to preorder a game and it goes on sale for half off two days after release.

It was always badass to see Magic Decks and Warhammer armies from people who used an adults spare cash as opposed to my spare cash and the combos and shit they could pull off. Or the armies they could field. Hell one of the Warhammer geeks was retired military. He loved the strategy part of setting up the armies and having artillery strikes and jumpjet marines . Seriously if you enjoy gaming TabletopVideoFigurines as a hobby dont be ashamed of it.

1837861,0,t3_2fka5r,If youre eyeballing the different games and are somewhat confused heres a roundup Guild Wars Trilogy includes all three main campaigns Prophecies Factions and Nightfall and doesnt include the expansion Eye of The North. Eye of The North is an expansion you need one of the campaigns to be able to play it. Guild Wars Game of the Year edition is Prophecies bonus items the first and oldest campaign. I would not recommend to start with this one because you dont start with heroes your configurable AI companions that you will be using a lot. Guild Wars Factions Second campaign its actually pretty hard but also the shortest because its more focused on PVP than PVE. It has a cool oriental theme. I also wouldnt recommend to start with this one because it expects you to be familiar with the mechanics somewhat. Guild Wars Nightfall Third and easiest campaign out of the three. Id recommend to start with this one because it gives you heroes configurable AI companions to start with.There is also a good writeup at GW Guru about this if you want more information.Recommended playing order I would start with Nightfall because its the easiest to pick up and is a good entry into the series. Then I would start with Factions. Its a bit harder than Nightfall but you should be able to manage after the previous game. I would save Prophecies for after that. The game itself is a pretty slow burn but you should be able to burn through the campaign pretty fast with your experienced party. I would definitely play Eye of The North last because it is pretty much endgame content and it looks beautiful. Note that you can switch between these campaigns at any time by going on a transport in one of the main cities.I was deeply invested in this game. For me it removed all the shitty parts of MMOs like griefing and killstealing because everything was instanced. It allowed me to play the game as a singleplayer game with my AI companions while still keeping the cool parts of a multiplayer experience like the interaction with people in the cities the dynamic market and certain optional content that was meant to be played with other people. I also made it a point to never really grind for stuff or repeat content and I still managed to get  hours worth of entertainment out of this game. I did a writeup a long while back about all the optional content you could do besides the campaigns and boy there is a lot of it.,GameDeals,ckanpvj,7,t5_2qwx3

If these bundles were  each and had no discount here would as many people be willing to take the plunge on the blind buy?  I doubt it.  If the games end up sucking across the board then its only  for a loss.  Dangerous line of thinking I know but thats implying that everything thats gonna be here will be a stinker and while Groupees offerings havent been omg I must absolutely own everything here for me Im anticipating at least one game in each set to make it worth it.  And if there are more then hey happy surprise for me!  It does reward impulse buying but more and more places are doing things like that.  Indie Galas offerings typically have a discount the first day as does some of Bundlestars bundles and you can argue that IndieRoyale and Humble Bundle both can punish and reward both early and late buyers due to Beat The Average setups.  I guess Im getting used to it.  And at least its not you have exactly five minutes to decide or the price goes up so you still have some time to think about it.

I have a feeling that the lack of persistent upgrades is going to be the biggest problem the game has and it probably could have benefited from a system similar to Crypt of the Necrodancer wherein youve got  game modes one with persistence and one without so you can kind of graduate from one into the other when youre ready.The game is fun though and well worth the price of admission especially during this sale.,GameDeals,ckvt15d,3,t5_2qwx3

But it absolutely blew me away you seriously cant do anything wrong buying it for that price. Its not perfect but it does so many things so damn well its astonishing. Id compare it to Dishonored in that regard great gameplay freedom innovation and just feels right.Its of course quite similar to the Batman combat system. Youre constantly surrounded by a MASSIVE and I mean massive amount of enemies due to that fact alone it feels different. The finishers are great the movement is great you get a great flow when fighting the Orcs especially with the later abilities which you WILL really wait for from the moment you start the game.Until you get the later finishers sometimes even after youve got them its a pretty difficult game at some points. You die to Shaka the Brain Damaged and immediately want to seek vengeance just to die again with him making fun of you. The Nemesis system is great and to be honest I couldnt care less about the story its just that great. Youre about to finish your marked enemy and out of the blue your arc enemy appears just to annoy you.This seems a bit incoherent but really buy it.

As I said it lacks endgame and there is a limited ammount of buildings and no tech tree. One way to challenge yourself is to limit yourself as in no trading firewood or no trading at all except for kettleseeds.That being said Banished nnow has mod support so in due time there will probably be a lot more content.

2250521,0,t1_clpq0tm,Just this morning I started the game up again to check out the developer commentaries. I tried rushing through the game without exploring. I works fine in the first episode but in the second I ran out of ammo. In my recorded Lets Play I never ran out of ammo. I always tried to conserve ammo for the better weapons by using the pistol and even then I didnt switch often to bigger weapons since I was so often maxed out on pistol ammo. I even remark this while playing.  That said if you run out of ammo always use the one where you have the most ammo of. And definitely explore more. The caches should be easy to find. Most other supplies are normally right in your face on the main path. Thats also something I noticed. The game doesnt reward exploring by giving you loot except the caches. What you find by looking around is almost exclusively story bits.  And if everything fails run like you said. You dont gain anything by killing enemies. They dont drop loot. ,GameDeals,clpvx22,2,t5_2qwx3

CK or any of the Paradox strategy games take place in a different time where you have to manage your nation from a map focusing on expansion and warfare. In Democracy  you have... a bunch of sliders. You use these to control a modern world country. The country has some basic info such as economic strength currency political tendencies and such. Other than that the countries play pretty similarly. The objective might not be the same for every country. Like you cant just go full communism immediately on USA or you wont be reelected while this objective might be easier in say Germany. All in all the answer to your question is no it does not have the same historical info like in CK or any other of the Paradox games ,GameDeals,cltadgx,3,t5_2qwx3

I have a Logitech g and it plays fantastically its definitely nowhere near as hardcore as Asseto Corsaactually is made to be fun. In fact the game plays just as well with a  controller or even keyboard! Truly a testament to their handling engine that you can have steering wheel and keyboard racers going neck to neck online.gt Hands down best racing game eYeah I did play grid once with a controller and thought it was fun. I know have a solid racing wheel  degrees turning force feedback and even a little back and forth shifter. It was an eyeopener racing was so much more fun and intense. I mean Ive played with racingwheels before but the fact that I had to use more force to steer at the right moments and the fact the wheel turned back after drifting was just.. wow...Im kinda convinced now but I need to check more videos.

I read you should disable Hola from your addon manager when not using it instead of just turning it off in the toolbar because it uses you as an intermediate or exit node if youre not a premium user even if its turned off.

I remember the dark days back in the s where your F key would wear out from all the quicksaving all the time. It makes almost every game incredibly easy if you can save whenever you want to kills all tension and challenge. Only games where i like to have quicksave option is in RPGs where you dont want to screw your character up with some wrong teching etc.. In games like splinter cell FPS platformers i really like checkpoints if they are fair ofc.You could say you dont HAVE to use quicksave if the option is there but come on we all know if you have the option you will probably abuse it D,GameDeals,cmi64k4,-1,t5_2qwx3

2612429,0,t3_2psb6j,For anyone wondering even though the game uses GFWL and I dont quite know how that works and when itll shut down it is a very fun game to play if you have a friend to play with.I never did manage to finish it though that was my own time management fault and no the games but I did reach the final parts of it. I found there to be some issues like the arrow accuracy I played Elara but mostly the game was very fun to play and I did have some very fun moments! Some of their banter is pretty funny. The puzzles arent really complex but some might be quite enjoyable. Looting could be better done in my opinion but its bearable. It does mean when you get a brand new weapon type you go bonkers! DBut the gameplay and the combat are quite fun! Both characters synergize really well and you mix up some pretty cool moves. As a coop game I really really enjoyed it!So if you have a friend to play this with I highly recommend the game.Oh dont forget to download a sweetFX mod for it since it makes it all that much better.,GameDeals,cmzkxxt,2,t5_2qwx3

2687400,0,t1_cn5a6et,Well I also hoped to have NPCs and Shops in LoG. But they are not there yet.But I must also admit that I dont really miss them. It would be a nice addition to a LoG though.The overworld is more or less one huge place which connects everything in LoG. More or less because the Overworlds themselves are single maps which have entries  exits to other maps. But in the map overview they are all connected and resemble a huge island.

2900306,0,t3_2t9umg,So Im a big fan of the LEGO games. nearly all of them. Each one brings something specific to the table. However depending on your preferences you may only enjoy the games which series interest you and thats fine. If you like DC this one if definitely worth picking up. Its got tons of characters in typical LEGO video game fashion. I think the addition of different suits for most of the main cast is interesting and unique. The game isnt as open world as previous entries but its honestly a fun game you can just have fun and cool down with. I definitely recommend it ,GameDeals,cnxrqqp,1,t5_2qwx3

2964612,0,t1_co4zhdg,sure! things I didnt like about TWDS directionless story way too heavy of a reliance on the conversation mechanic. Needed more diversity of gameplay. double this with the quick realization that what you say doesnt really matter  of the time.  ridiculously simple puzzles. needed more to break the monotony.  poorly written for a number of reasons that would be spoilery. In short I felt that everything that happens in this game is forced by the writers. I imagine they just look at each other and say how can we make this more dark? Bad things happening isnt inherently good writing and this case it is quite lazy.   Supsension of disbelief is strained when your survival group of  humans adults relies on an  year old to get anything done retreads a plot from Season  that I didnt care for the first time around for basically the entire nd half of the season borrows plots from the television show which seemed boring to me and I quit watching the TV show at the end of season   illusion of choice is pretty succinctly broken this season. You can pretty easily see behind the curtain. poorly optimized played on .  few characters that you give a shit about  Days plays basically no impact to Season  despite saying that it would be a bigger deal. literally changed a couple lines of dialogue. Im not done with telltale but I am done with this series. I am exicted for Tales from The Borderlands and loved The Wolf Among Us but TWD has outlived its quality and is running on reputation at this point. ,GameDeals,co53b87,3,t5_2qwx3

And in the case of Dragon Quest they couldve had Level develop a single player console game but they probably wouldnt release it so close to a numbered MMO entry in the series it wouldve been awesome if they just made it Dragon Quest Online and had a Level Dragon Quest X that took notes from and tried to live up to all the expectations from  release on the PS or wherever else.,GameDeals,co8gpgw,3,t5_2qwx3

By the way like i have mentioned in my previous post you can buy or get extremely more fun with a better gameplay story etc. with another products... gtgt Stop expecting games to be so amazing that they revolutionize the industry  If you dont know but even good products dont revolutionize the industry... it do only a few. But it does not mean that you can not enjoy a great solid wellthought and wellcoded game if it is not the best one.

3034485,0,t3_2uvzty,Wasnt a big fan of Sickbrick. It got pretty repetitive very quickly. Though its quite short from what Ive read in the other reviews.     Dead Effect is some good old zombie killing action though it also tends out drag out the levels between new additions as well. It keeps it a bit fresh with a nice upgrade and shop system between levels though.      Dementium II HD is an alright survival horror game. A big fan of the genre would probably enjoy it as a timewaster and its not bad if you enjoy a game where you can get all of the achievements in one playthrough. Definitely not one of the best games out there though.    Fancy Skulls is a great FPS roguelike with a nice minimalist style. Id put it about onpar with Paranautical Activity though I havent played it in a while so Im not sure what recent updates have added.    Necrovision is actually a really great horrororiented FPS game. If you liked games like Painkiller and The Darkness then itd probably be right up your alley. It has an interesting system where you get damage bonuses and such based on your attack combos and you can mix and match dualwielding weapons. I actually had a lot of fun with it.

3080499,0,t1_coh8q9k,Its definitely worth  but I have very mixed feelings about the game.  As far as the gameplay itself goes its excellent.  Probably one of the best thirdperson shooters Ive played in the last several years.On the other hand I found the story characters and overall presentation to be very obnoxious.  There wasnt a single likable or interesting character in the game and consequently I never really cared about what was happening to any of them.  If the gameplay werent so good I would probably not have finished it.  The game is also riddled with short cutscenes that are meant to make things feel more cinematic but frequently interrupt the flow of the levels. The cutscenes themselves also have this noisedistortion effect that I found distracting and overused as well as the strange decision to have random words show up on screen as the characters say them.Some of those criticisms might come off as kind of shallow and in a way they are but cumulatively I found that they significantly impacted my overall enjoyment of the game.  Just wanted to mention it since I hadnt really heard much mention of those aspects before Id played it. ,GameDeals,cohaihg,7,t5_2qwx3

Much of this is due to Humble Bundle and other sites like Bundle Stars Steam etc.  The competition have driven prices of games down to an all time low.  The nature of the beast is stay competitive or get left behind. Like it or not that is the reality we are living in.Personally I think this is a better deal for people who do not own any of these games and like the style.  I thought Tomb Raider was worth  for the enjoyment I got out of it.  However for those of us that remember  Humble Bundles typically maxed out around  or  for just as much content including AAA content like Square Enix Deep Silver EA WB etc.  So for those of us that are looking for deals We are on GameDeals after all then its hard to ignore price.As far as the argument that it goes to charity so contribute more and change your preferences.

In the past like the late nineties one would buy a game for some large sum and perhaps an expansion or two and then there would be no new content. By contrast theres still new content in the works for CK if one is to believe the ArumbaParadox session done at the Paradox Con recently. But does that mean that getting just perhaps the main game and the first expansion as we would have done in the Diablo case is half of the content? Arent we at four or five times the content by now? I dont think we can compare CK and all the larger DLC to a single game from another series. There have been updates for years where other series would have simply released a new game. Instead of CK  DLCs we might just as well have got CK CK CKLegacy of Rome CK  expansion CK  Rome  Old Gods CK  Sons of Abraham CK Rajas ... akin to military shooters where each year a new iteration with minor changes seems to be released.,GameDeals,covwj8e,3,t5_2qwx3

In GW I would simply use abilities on cooldown and spam them as fast as possible dodging when necessary.  It felt very spammy button mashy and completely lacking in anything strategic or requiring skill of any sort.  SWToR was different I had to think about when to use my abilities and plan things out.  I found it much deeper and more interesting.

3482371,0,t1_cpp0l1x,Ive only completed the first one and parts of the second game  in German their original language so I cant talk about the quality of the translations. I really enjoyed the first game. Its been a few years but it looked great had an interesting mystery fair and logical puzzles and a remarkably well presented story. It both sold well and was very well received by the gaming press at least in Germanspeaking countries. Whats interesting is that it usually received  and higher ratings from German magazines whereas internationally it received much lower scores. Its either because it was poorly translated or  like the Gothic series  it had a much larger appeal to German audiences. This game is probably one of the main reasons for the revival of the genre in Germany which was several years before adventure games became successful again in the rest of the world.Part  didnt impress me as much. Its still a pretty game though even to this date. Gameplaywise its more of the same but at least subjectively I found both puzzles and story to be not as interesting as before which was probably why I havent completed it. It could be that it is superior to its predecessor but that I simply had become more demanding over the years.Again I cant comment on the rest of the series but I have played other games by the same developers and enjoyed them quite a lot so Id expect the other two titles to be at least competent adventure games.,GameDeals,cpp7rwf,2,t5_2qwx3

3686504,0,t1_cqcds6b,In my opinion absolutely yes. Legacy is absolutely required as part of the overarching story of the three games and Mark of the Assassin is just a lot of fun. Also as uNotveryprettyvacant said theyre almost worth it just for the party banter. Make sure you bring your sibling with you on Legacy Act I spoilerss they can come with you even when theyre in the Circle Templars or Gray Wardens after Act I as it deals with Hawkes family pretty heavily. For that same reason Id recommend playing Legacy near the tail end of Act II  specifically sometime after the quest All That Remains. I recommend playing Mark of the Assassin right at the beginning of Act III  it makes a lot more sense to do as Hawkes pretty famous at that point plus it helps extend the games shortest act a bit. Also bringing Varric on either DLC is a pretty good idea  but then again when is bringing Varric along not a good idea?,GameDeals,cqchid5,6,t5_2qwx3
3686962,0,t1_cqch1a9,I have no clue how you view all the innovations Steam has brought as bloat. Steam is actively trying to revolutionize an industry damn near singlehandedly with an entirely new operating system catered to game performance. To call that bold is a massive understatement. They are just tenacious to keep the industry going forward. Origin is a download client. Thats it. Theres nothing wrong with that but to say its better doesnt make any sense.   I can only speak personally but on any computer or connection Ive ever been logged onto Ive never seen any difference in DL speed between either client unless a Holiday salefree game is going on.     Origin in no way gives a new free game every week Syndicate has been up for quite a while now. But their free game policy is only because they are forced to try to give some sort of incentive to try Origin because Steams service is so vastly superior they have to try and compete somewhere else. Every innovation and step forward from Steam has been absolutely free. Just for example inhome streaming. I absolutely love inhome streaming and Ive never paid a goddamn dime for it.   I feel like everyone has forgotten what PC gaming was like before Steam. You had this product code that had limited activations downloads were slow as hell DRM never worked it was a pain the ass and just as expensive as console gaming.  Youd have a tough hill to climb to convince me that EA would offer the same amount of innovation and content as Steam does for zero cost. Because like I said before Ive seen what the PC industry looks like when they have control. And it wasnt pretty. EA had to be forced to implement Origin for their products Steams implementation was so good and so profitable they had no choice but to follow suit.    And you cant just say its good regardless of customers. That was the whole point. Steam is going through growing pains. Way back when it was just Valve games it was easy as hell to get ahold of someone. But now PC gaming is growing so fast and getting so many more customers theyre having trouble keeping up. Can we cut them a fucking break and let them try to get something implemented before we hand over the industry to EA? ,GameDeals,cqcjdz8,3,t5_2qwx3

I did get a few skyrockets when using dpi but after retuning the surface with the surface tuning feature it seemed to fix it. If you have mediumsmall sized hands and want the same sensor used in the G I would suggest looking at the new Logitech G a lot lighter and better suited for claw grip users.PS The lift high is really really low and cant be adjusted its easy to get a spaz out if you lift it on a slight angle.,GameDeals,cqyduct,1,t5_2qwx3

4028753,0,t1_crfe2z9,Ive played Red Faction   and Guerrilla. tldr st game is great nd game is okay rd game is fun. For the selling price which includes the th game as well not a bad deal.Red Faction  in my opinion is a classic. One of my favorite fps from the early Playstation  era. I liken the feelatmosphere of the game to Farcry  or vice versa. The story starts off with a simple goal to survive and as the game further progresses you find out a lot more is going on around you then what you see on the surface. The games Geomod was pretty fun as well. Spent a lot of time with the rocket launcher digging holes in multiplayer maps with friends because we could.Red Faction  is an okay game. The game differs from the st in many aspects. Instead of taking place on Mars it takes place on Earth after the st game. And where as the st game has a nearfuture feel to it the nd goes full scifi future with beam guns and nanobots. The story is a bit weaker but it was still fun.Red Faction Guerrilla moves away from the first  games instead of a fps on rails story its a rd person open world style game. The story was okay this time the game actually takes place back on Mars which is a plus. They went all out though with the building destruction physics which is the key selling point to the game. Figuring out the best way to destroy buildings is oddly satisfying. I probably spent more time just running around knocking down things with my sledge hammer and remote detonation mines than caring about what really was happening story wise. The developers probably knew this as there is a challenge mode outside of the normal game where you try and rack up as many points as you can by destroying buildings in the most efficient way within a set amount of time great for playing with friends.Havent played or heard much about the th game. But for  for  games thats not bad at all.,GameDeals,crfiat3,2,t5_2qwx3

4102803,0,t1_crnw0rv,Dawn of War  and Company of Heroes  you will probably enjoy.  They share many similarities with the traditional CampC style RTS but are different enough to be interesting in their own right.  Biggest differences are that units are trained in squads and can sometimes be kitted out to handle different situations the basic Space Marine unit can be equipped with heavy anti infantry weapons andor anti vehicle weapons that lets starting units stay useful even in late game.  Additionally resources are gathered by sending your troops to different capture points on the map and claiming them after which you get a trickle of whatever resource it is as long as you own it.Dawn of War  is still fun but has problems with it being in smaller in scope and getting rid of base building so holding on to resource points is a pain.

In fact your experience is distributed across all the members in your party meaning a singlecharacter party will level up much faster.

None of the popular digital retailers offer this kind of shitty deal why would the pioneer make a step backwards?they dont offer it... yet. they also didnt thought of paid mods till a month or so ago. they also didnt thought of digital distribution till Valve started it. world changes. and valve may have a financial situation if e.g. they make a lot of price errors and people get advantage of it and then they have to pay full price for they keys to the publisher or whatever. then they may have the bright idea to secure some funds for a while blocking access to account who dont pay some kind of monthly fee. theyre a business after all. maybe some stupid directive thinks its the best way to sort an economical situation. okay I may be just a bit paranoid but in this liberal world those kind of things can happen. anyway youre completely free to do whatever you want of course but maybe some random guy hadnt thought of it now sees that he is wise not to put all the eggs in the same basket. and for the rest of us who keep buying games on steam myself included lets hope Im just a little paranoid. ,GameDeals,crvf586,0,t5_2qwx3

4247555,0,t3_39lrjo,Day  of the Steam Summer saleMy Games to Buy  I loved the witcher but its not for everyone. Do somr reaserch on it before committing. Portal  Rogue Legacy and Risk of Rain were all great too. As a reminder here are my responses to the most frequently asked questions about why we use Median hours to calculate a cost per hour and whether cost per hour is usefulgt Its a median  which means its not the amount of time it takes to finish the game but it is one of the best values when comparing two different games to each other.gt The median is the most stable numerical representation of the playtime distribution that you can see as a graph on the linked pages. Its the number where half of the people who own it play it less and half play it more. The reasons why people play or dont play games is never fully clear  but knowing how the people who own the game treat it in their Library can be quite useful when making a decision on buying. gt It doesnt replace your own personal game preferences or how good a game is. It doesnt tell you whether the hours you spend will be spent grinding or spent exploring or spent making meaningful and interesting decisions. Thats up to you to figure out and why we have so many great subs on the subject.gt Cost per hour is not the only metric to use when evaluating a game. Use your own personal preference redditor reviews metascore or whatever else you like about games to choose the ones you think youll enjoy playing. Then use the cost per hour to help you decide if the game is priced appropriately for the fun you think youll get out of it.gt NOTE we dont take into account people who have played the game less than  hour and obvious bad data like a million hours played.Without further ado here are the numbers.NOTE Ive decided to merge the tables in this view. I find it more informative than the separate tables.

Its claiming the Steam API the source for most price history sites may have been mistaken and the USD price was for a bundle of The New Order base game and The Old Blood miniprequel.      That could make some sense. On ITADs price history page only Steams price is showing at  other major stores like GamersGate GMG GetGames Uplay Humble etc. have it at  since midMarch. Thatd be odd for a price drop to only occur on Steam. Also  is kind of an odd price to drop to.    I tried looking for an Archive.org snapshot of the Steam store page but I get stuck at the age gate.

4297570,0,t1_cs9qem4,I adore it. Best storytelling of any game Ive ever seen including the metal gear franchise bioshock elder scrolls the AC franchise or any other game. Certainly miles ahead of every other MMORPG out there.It challenges you in a myriad different ways and it has a really nice and helpful community. Fan organized events a decent roleplay community fan organized support structures for when official events happen like people who run around scouting for world bosses and report them and allow people to meet up on them. People saving bags they dont need and trading them sometimes giving them away so everyone can complete their achievements. Lots of helpful advice and people being mindful of not spoiling things generally speaking.Devs taking an active interest in the community and keeping an open line of communication. Sure theyre working on a skeleton crew because of financial troubles but they still release content as quickly as possible and they deliver great stuff in my opinion and the opinion of most players I think.Some people lament the combat system because its not like TERA or Age of Conan another funcom game. Its really basically like a slightly more advanced and active version of world of warcraft or swtor or any other game like that.There are three factions theyre pitted against one another in pvp but you can cooperate across factions in the open world if you wanna call it that. PVP is limited to certain areas like stonehenge and eldorado and fusang projects.I really recommend picking it up while its on sale its dirt cheap and its pay once  play forever. If you really like it you can subscribe or buy dlc to get extra content but its not like its mandatory and you get a lot of content by buying the base game.So I suggest you give it a go and if you have any questions about getting started head over to rthesecretworld or the official forums at forums.thesecretworld.com or drop by the sanctuary chat channel ingame by typing chat join sanctuary no quotes while in game.,GameDeals,csa257k,1,t5_2qwx3

4300882,0,t1_csaepku,depends on what grabs you for replay. As others have mentioned you get costumes that alter your play style by limiting certain things or boostingreducing abilities thus it gives you an excuse to try through the game with different tactics. There collectibles to find which include little trialchallenge rooms. And then there are also leaderboards. There is also a new game plus.If none of those sound appealing than it really is just a nice little stealth game for a just over . ,GameDeals,csafmr9,0,t5_2qwx3
4304232,0,t1_csasldu,Wasnt aware of that. Just checked it out. Looks pretty good but it looks like the kept most of the core mechanics they just gave it more eye candy.TBH Id still pick this game up and see if you like it rather than wait for the new one. Its guaranteed to cost full price when it comes out and not get any discounts any time soon. This game will probably give you almost  of the experience of the game mechanics and how it runs. And now with the refunds this is actually a great game to pick up for testing purposes. The mechanics never change your players just advance up and get better at various aspects of the game. So the game play experience in the first two hours will be pretty much indicative of how the rest of the game will be which hopefully will make a person realize if they want to keep or return the game.,GameDeals,csat8pl,1,t5_2qwx3

Unfortunately there are instances where someone with no knowledge gets hired by flying under the radar and doing good interviews. I can promise you that the ones that are knowledgeable despise them and do everything in their power to get them unemployed if theyre unwilling to educate themselves and try. I worked with someone like that in my department and he made us all look bad and we couldnt stand it. Eventually he screwed himself by not showing up to work and got fired. I had to do so much damage recovery due to that guy.

4381433,0,t3_3b78rc,Im going to throw my  cents in for anyone on the fence on Orcs amp Men or Mars War Logs.These games are both awesome.  These games will both make you laugh.  Sometimes you will laugh because your supposed to i.e. humorous writing and other times your going to laugh because of how BAD they can be at times. That being said they are both absolutely worth these prices and absolutely worth your free time.  You reach a point where a game cant just be cheap it has t be worth the time.  Both have more in common with an action RPG then a traditional turn based both have pretty linear stories they dont hang around too long.  Of Orcs and Men is really fascinating because your playing from the other side and the characters are genuinely interesting and well written.  Mars War Logs is just insane...  Its so ridiculous at times its just amazing.  Production values can suffer things like clipping and graphical oddities spring up every now and again.  Animations can seem jilted or just poor especially on throw away charactersnpcs.  These games didnt have the Mass Effect or Skyrim budget and it shows.  But if you look past the rough edges there is somethings special about both of them and they have flown under the radar for so many people but Spider really did a good job on both.If you have to pick one or the other I would urge you to go on theme do you want cheesy in a good way scifi or high fantasy?  Ideally you get both because neither should be missed.  Especially at these prices. ,GameDeals,csjiuo5,5,t5_2qwx3

At this price it could be valuable simply as a toy to play around with.The programs are great for mimicing the gameplay of super nintendo RPGs FFs Lufias BoFs Earthbound as examples with a lot of customization options you can program yourself with Ruby. Theres also a free Rpg Maker VX Lite you could try as a demo.Most of the DLC isnt worth it unless its for commercial use much cheaper than alternatives.

My desktop with a ghz i and a GTX  gets fps however. Second I just dont think anyone who isnt super nerdy about boats would enjoy this. Boats are slow. Real slow.My two cents. ,GameDeals,csyq37b,35,t5_2qwx3
4509557,0,t1_csyztk2,Thats certainly an option the reason we went this route was our understanding from the meta thread was that their would be many more sitewide deals ala Steam sales so we expected it to be harder to navigate without pointing things out. Like when Amazon has hundreds of items on sale and browsing is impossible. More importantly though with flash deals and things being added and removed periodically throughout the day we wanted something that was updateable rather than having several new submissions each time a new set of deals comes up. However if making and maintaining the threads is too difficult and GMG isnt able to help out with the lists then the Nuuvem Winter  HB DRMFreedom style single overview links style is probably exactly what well fall back on to prevent clutter and centralize discussions.,GameDeals,csz2ttu,1,t5_2qwx3

You can lock your game down so its friends only who can join if you dont want strangers.  The voice chat is actually really good they apply voice effects to you based on your surroundings so a small indoor concrete area will have a slight echo etc.  There is an option where people can invade your multiplayer games and play as one of the hunters and you have to fight them off but that is able to be tuned in the options as to how often it happens if at all,GameDeals,ct9i8wf,1,t5_2qwx3

With the Wii Us minimal storage and complete lack of sales save for a few obscure third party titles I just cant rationalize buying digital. Im also a Gamers Club Unlocked member at Best Buy which gets me new games cheap when I buy there. All that said Im excited for Rare Replay but not confident enough in it to buy digital just yet. Grabbing a physical copy just in case the games are glitched to hell buggy broken etc. I mean you just never know these days.

The most you see of other cultures is as trade convoys in which you can buysell goods with.I will say this unlike dwarf fort this game is a lot easier to navigate the many building mechanics thanks to the UI amp hotkeyswhich you can change.

4881571,0,t1_cu9qtmn,I dont know enough about the engineering going on behind DRMs so I wouldnt be able to compare the Steam DRM vs Uplay DRM technical benefits but...What Valve has achieved year after year for the last decade is make the Steam DRM sexy to the enduser. Making DRM desirable is NOT an easy task to undertake and it takes years of trials amp errors and relentless efforts. Its not about a few sales or giveaways. Its about commitment to make it better for the gamers. And commitment means when you are already the best you continue to improve. There are no finish line just the promise that better is not enough.Uplay is not even close to this and if they want to succeed somehow it will take years to become sexy. Sexy is not about functionalities its about commitment.And I know Steam sales support is way below average from my experience Origin and XBox Live are lightyears ahead of Steam on this turf but it has nothing to do with DRM.TLDR Uplay DRM is generic at best and mostly a nuisance.,GameDeals,cu9uyms,6,t5_2qwx3

4964065,0,t1_cuk5drg,I was really expecting a great game. Instead we got a meh game. In all honesty I think that they pushed the game out too quickly it almost feels that they didnt have time to add new stuff besides changing the victories and factions.,GameDeals,cuk9c7l,2,t5_2qwx3
4967245,0,t1_cuklykm,Tldr Its soloplayable without much restrictions. Beautiful graphics. Gameplay is a hit or miss I think you either really like it or get bored after one playthrough or so.    I dropped the game about half a year ago or so.  Anyhow the game actually wasnt too guild reliant at all. Playing the main PvE is completely solodoable with some restrictions to bigger events. For dungeons one will need a group even though some are doable with less than max group number but people were found fast theres a serverwideor even cross server group finder.  The best gear was obtainable via some special set of dungeons which included some changing paths and adjusting dificulty but quite some extensive grinding. Youll need a group here as well. Anyhow that equipment isnt THAT much better then the second best really small extras and this second best is easily obtainable by soloplaying.  PvP  no clue there were some updates but this is the reason I quitted. I loved GW PvP and PvP in the second just felt like shit. Theres big WvWvW World vs World vs World maps  servers fighting over castles and stuff if you are into something like that that mode gets balanced quite much I think.  But imo the structured PvP is kinda a sidething in this game not quite sure if its even updated that much.  Anyhow with the expansion coming out or is already released? things can change I guess especially regarding the gear.,GameDeals,cuknqdi,2,t5_2qwx3

5019315,0,t3_3jlsow,You need the expansion now.  Game is not worth it alone.  With the expansion and . changes this is by far my favorite game.  Additionally season  just started so everyone has a fresh start and you wont be much behind anyone gearwise.  The games graphics and gameplay were always good.  The itemization AH grouping disincentives lack of endgame and difficulty based solely on monster hpdamage were all terrible at release and gave this game a bad name.  However the devs have more than made up for it now theyve listened to the communitys feedback and frankly the game is awesome now.  Of course any kind of fastpaced geargrinding game will probably get old after a month of heavy play the seasons make it worth coming back to play quarter after quarter.

Why wouldnt Groupees sell you a preorder for  that includes a bunch of PDFs some DRMfree games and one rebundled Steam title that no one wanted?If this stuff didnt sell they would work harder to get bigger names in their bundles. We have no one to blame but ourselves. The bundlers are taking the easy way but the customers are enabling them.edit also Indie Royale went down because Desura went down. BlinkBundle went down for a lack of trying. Their bundles were few and far between and they were never organized. People forgot about them. They had great offerings.,GameDeals,curygyk,9,t5_2qwx3

5039201,0,t3_3jyok7,Hmm not sure how I feel about this. While more cash for the devs sounds good in principle there is a reason why store fronts take such a large share to begin with. I do hope that youll be able to sustain yourself with such a small sales percentage but I personally doubt it. With regards to the whole random discount I dislike it. A lot. I do not like the idea of not knowing how much something is going to cost me. I have a budget and I plan accordingly and this random nonsense does not allow me to properly plan ahead. While it may be a nice surprise for some I am not going to shop there just for the off chance that something may be cheaper for me. It is either cheaper or it is not  there no middle ground. So unless you have significant sales in the future besides the random discount I wont be visiting your store much.Lastly I know you are excited to get things going but did you really just launch with a handful of games or is it me being on mobile just showing me so few? If you did launch with so few youve shouldve waited till you had a larger selection to choose from. No one likes visiting an empty store and the same goes for websites. If it is just me then disregard this part.All in all I wish you the best of luck. Starting a new project especially a business is never easy and one filled with many challenges that I do hope you and your team will overcome. ,GameDeals,cutexzx,85,t5_2qwx3

Seems like this game doesnt support p and was made in RPG Maker or the like which is a limit to that engine but a workaround for recording footage like this would be to record in windowed mode at a vertical resolution of as close to  as possible and then when editing the footage just leave the horizontal resolution alone At  vertical the  ratios horizontal resolution would be . Theres ways to force RPG Maker games to scale like that a bit better  I use Borderless Gaming on my p screen to fill up a large portion of my screen with  games at least vertically and since I have an ultrawide I still have half my monitor available to me while I game. Along with that a lot of recording apps support recording games in windowed mode so they should grab that footage no problem. Also when uploading I believe YouTube will automatically add the black bars  avoid adding your own just for those that may have  screens and then they can view the video filling their screen instead of doubling up on black bars.,GameDeals,cwazn9i,10,t5_2qwx3

I would like to mention that this happened with my first purchase as well and indiegalas service was excellent but after the second purchase I did not get any service from indiegala at all and no reply from indigala after I sent a total of  emails to understand the problem.,GameDeals,cwn5y3a,1,t5_2qwx3

5667531,0,t1_cwzlcfg,I would argue that Destiny is a different case because it was in a good place after the release of the second expansion even if you didnt own it. It was in a great state for everyone before the newest expansion launched but they basically cut vanilla players out of content when the new expansion launched. It wouldnt be a big deal if there was no item progression etc. but they made it so you could level to  only owning the base game and then locked difficulty settings for missions so that the most difficult content you can do is only level . Even if you enjoyed the gameplay and not the carrot on a stick its not worth playing unless you spend more money and thats a terrible business practice. Even if you make the point that MMOs constantly trivialize old content that old content at least stays challenging if you dont buy the extra levels which just isnt the case with Destiny.,GameDeals,cwzm2g7,2,t5_2qwx3

Dont take the food in episode ? Doesnt matter fuckface will still kidnap Clem and blame you for his family.And yeah TWD totally had likeable characters. Kenny was just full of redeeming qualities and Ben totally wasnt a fuck up. The only decent characters were Clem and Lee. Totally agree with you about Mass Effect though.

5750175,0,t3_3twem8,Personally Im not a big fan of Dark Moon. The vaguely spooky vibe you got from navigating your way through the mansion in the original Luigis Mansion is completely gone and replaced with something that feels very cartoony. Granted Luigis Mansion was never meant to be a traditionally scary game but its pacing and aesthetic design ultimately added up to an experience that was more spooky than its premise lets on. In Dark Moon though the pacing is so quick and the presentation is so straightforward that the overall experience feels way less spooky and almost arcadey. Its not a bad game by any means but I cant bring myself to like it when I find the original execution of the idea far more appealing than this iteration.,GameDeals,cx9v5c5,16,t5_2qwx3

5762384,0,t3_3u2j1h,Not a terrible game but very disappointing. The strategy level stuff is exceedingly shallow you just build stuff as you need it and...thats it. Its about Farmville levels of depth. Which is a real shame. With a deeper strategy game this would be pretty awesome.Then theres the tactical level. The turnbased combat is pretty good and sometimes quite fun but its rendered completely meaningless by the fact that nothing you do at the tactical level carries over to the strategy level other than actually winning or losing or course. What I mean is that your guys have experience and can level up unlocking new skills and bonuses but you dont earn experience from the tactical encounters. Some encounters just give everybody a level up just because its a set bonus for completing that battle but it doesnt matter who you take or what they do in a battle. Theres no earning experience through combat. And some encounters you can simple skip and there really is no reason not to skip them. Since you get nothing for doing them.Its absolutely mystifying why they designed it that way. With a deeper strategic game and tactical battles that actually matter this would be a really good game. As it is its just a meh. Buy it if you really like XCom style turnbased battles and love prohibition style gangsters.   ,GameDeals,cxbdlcu,5,t5_2qwx3

5809449,0,t1_cxh6zvw,Well if you are new Id say you should play FF. Its the genre defining title in the series and imo one of the most influental game ever which made JRPGs popular in the west. Also its not an easy game. I mean its not hard either but unlike the games of today a lot of things are not explained with great details there is some basic tutorial but you need to understand and explore a lot of things on your ownAlso graphics wise it didnt really age well. Either you play with the original graphics which means x resolution or with the HD option which turns the menus characters dialog boxes into high def BUT the prerendered background and environment will remain the same and really pixelated.Looks like thisI know it can might turn some people down but the game itself is still absolutely glorious. One of my fav story ever great characters beautiful soundtrack. So if you dont mind the graphics its an almost  years old game you should def start with FF. Oh and get an Xbox  controller! Much better and easier to play the game with it.,GameDeals,cxh7tu3,2,t5_2qwx3
5809791,0,t1_cxh8yc7,I would seek out advice from someone better than me Im not an expert. Maybe rbuildapc might be good?But first thing first make sure the cooler works. Check to see if the fan spins when it is under load like during the game. Check to see it is secured. and Check to make sure there isnt too much dust. Also check to see if you have some type of program controlling the fan. You might be limiting the fan output usually done to prevent sound that is limiting its ability to cool your cpu.If all that is fine I would probably just reseat the cpu by cleaning it off and applying new thermal paste. But I would check with experts first.,GameDeals,cxh9ctf,1,t5_2qwx3

5819300,0,t1_cxie2wl,Veteran plays fine once youre familiar with some of the standard strategies and setups in normal. Everything is just a a little bit harder and dangerous. Nothing really changes in the gameplay. Personally I havent tried Insane.You might have been unlucky and played one of the patches that really screwed up the balancing of the game. Xenonauts is one of those games that has gone through some terrible patches.As far as the learning curve goes I think its pretty good for this type of game. You can learn by failing meaning you dont really have to read guides or tutorials... and you really should be going for the fail faster method. Thats why Ironman mode is the only way I recommend playing the game. I think too many people sink time and effort into a safe theyve already lost but dont realize because they can load multiple times and somehow crawl through the mission once they hit the rng lottary. Everytime you reset the game you should be much better and get off on a better start.Games like Crusader Kings II fail in the you can learn by doing catagory... and thats something I dislike.,GameDeals,cxifswy,2,t5_2qwx3

5887573,0,t1_cxqjspo,New to simulationpuzzle games? Quite probably. The main challenge in the game is fitting in all the machines and belts in to be able to manufacture the drugs. Its easy in the beginning but when you dont have money to buy a new plot of land but need to upgrade a drug to get more money thats when you need to figure out how to be space efficient.Example you have a drug that treats acne. Its active range is  and you get it at concentration . You need disolvers and ionisers to bring the concentration down then a pill printing machine or others if youve researchedunlocked them to make it into a sellable product. You also choose to either ship out with side effects or try to minimise them as much as possible  some side effects cant be removed. Then for more complex curestreatments you need to get to a specific concentration use a specific machine andor even add in a second drug with a catalyst to upgrade it or third for the really long chains.,GameDeals,cxre7m6,1,t5_2qwx3

6105450,0,t1_cyjkmpv,gt Thats something I never understood. Why would they be worried about which gun is stronger? Its not PvP its against AIHeres the biggest issue. Unless youre equipped with pay to win weapons most hosts will boot you. First the weapons can do more damage so your team likely wont have to carry you. Secondly if youre using a stat boosted weapon everyone gets an experience bonus at the end of the mission. To maximize these gains hosts will boot players that dont have the pay to win weapons. Additionally the developer has talked about setting up competitions around the game. These will likely be speed runs or survival based competitions. This of course completely favors their decision to put in microtransactions as players that want to compete will have to pay money to get the best weapons.,GameDeals,cyjmlf7,16,t5_2qwx3

6119987,0,t1_cyl8x50,Tales from the Borderlands is great but its a Telltale game so it focuses more on narrative than anything else. Its also hilarious really captures the humor of the series well. Honestly one of Telltales best efforts imo. Really needs a Season  ASAP.  Amnesia Memories is one I also enjoyed! I havent finished all of the routes but the voice acting is nice art is great and theres a ton of routes. A ton. I really enjoyed the story too. Only con is its really hard to get the good endings. Either that or I am great at getting the bad endings.    Final Fantasy VII is excellent although rebind the keys because the default bindings are stupid. The graphics have aged poorly but its one of my favorite RPGs of all time. Plus they replaced the original PC midi music with the better PS music. Just keep in mind that the remake is going to have a different battle system for some reason and is going to be split in parts so its probably going to cost a small fortune.  DA O is a great RPG really fun great story lots of depth. Nice open world with very satisfying combat. Havent finished it but Ive really enjoyed my time with it so far.  Havent played The Banner Saga but the other choices are great ones. Really hard to recommend just one as they all excel in their respective genres.,GameDeals,cyla29u,1,t5_2qwx3

6483397,0,t1_czp2x7k,gt Yeah I know... But I bet a console release will happen once they have time to port it. Now I just want them to have proper normal controller support and Ill buy it on steam. Enemy Unknown was great using a controller and Im used to gaming on the couch anyway.Quoted from the wikipedia page as a information from them gtnlike Enemy Unknown which was released on PC and consoles then later on mobile devices XCOM  is a PCexclusive video game and is solely distributed through Steam. Firaxis Games stated the reason behind the decision was the companys experience in developing PC games. Moreover Firaxis believes that making XCOM  a PConly title would allow them to introduce new features  such as procedural levels  and that developing for a single platform would be simpler. The game will feature gamepad support which was added after the game is released for Microsoft Windows OS X and Linux. The references are interviews with IGN and Gamespot. I have a feeling this is going to be like Civilization in regards to PC only release. Firaxis is typically a PC only studio EU was strange in that regard. It has gamepad support apparently so likely more than just the SC.Edit They have also been reported saying they were unhappy with the lack of mod support on EU and will make sure we have it for . Once again pushing it will PC only. I know FO will be breaching the console mod barrier but i dont think everyone is trying that at the moment.,GameDeals,czpxjhu,1,t5_2qwx3

6509981,0,t1_czsj4cd,I recommend it as a single player game and your mileage may vary on the multiplayer end of things. For me the multiplayer was a mix of a bunch of mini games in a nicer looking package. I feel like other games do each mini game better and so unless you are playing with a bunch of friends and want to run around creating havoc then I just have a hard time recommending it for the multiplayer. I did enjoy the single player though and it was a good game overall. I dont see how it would go a whole lot lower anytime soon. ,GameDeals,czsok8q,0,t5_2qwx3

Im terrible at it but its just too much fun to blow things up and watch it all get destroyed. With nearly  hours into the franchise I have to recommend.Also if you want an RTS with an active community try Wargame.

6626669,0,t3_46dz76,MGSV is fantastic. Unfortunately its in a sort of Zelda cycle where the latest game is considered shit until the next one comes out or people have long enough for it to click.You are Big Boss the Legendary Solider leader of a private army the boss of Motherbase. You do missions for outside entities and you also pursue your own personal story of revenge. The concept is to make you feel like youre the HNIC or CEO of Motherbase. This IS NOT Operation Snake Eater and you ARE NOT Infiltrating Shadow Moses. Its not a single infiltration missions you arent on a linear path so of course youre not getting  minute cut scenes every  mins like in previous games.The story is doled out conservatively in such a way that you are meant to feel like you are in Big Boss shoes so of course it will feel sparse if you spend hrs doing  side missions and return to a  min cut scene.Each cut scene is much deeper than at first glance. When playing it or looking back remember the concept of sins of our fathers punishment atonement and also take note of his comrades words as a reflection of Snakes own thoughts and emotions projected onto them.There is plenty of story here but not the same kind.MGSV is meant to fill a small gap in the timeline but its not an ending or a beginning.Just remember that it was his final Metal Gear and like any great artist it will puzzle people for years to come before its understood. Also MGO is amazing and a fantastic multiplayer experience. ,GameDeals,d04r6j0,10,t5_2qwx3

6722470,0,t1_d0emcb5,Im a fan of all the games but I think a good starting point would be total war shogun . Its set entirely on Japan so all the units are pretty similar across all factions so its pretty easy to get into and play. Basically all total war games is a Rock Paper Scissors sort of deal swords beat spears spears beat Calvary Calvary beats swords cause panic and archers are a general nuisance to everyone. The other total wars have pretty crazy unit diversity at times so it can get overwhelming but shogun  does a great job easing you into the game.The standalone expansion fall of the samurai is fantastic as well it plays a lot more like colonial times where instead of melee engagements youre mostly trying to line up rifle infantry to fire at each other so positioning and flanking are extremely important. This game has pretty sweet tom cruise the last samurai moments with glorious katana charges against maxim guns.Both these games have incredible graphics and should run great on your setup. If I were you I would pick up shogun  with the blood pack and see how you like the game. If so maybe consider fall of the samurai. Have fun!,GameDeals,d0entjt,2,t5_2qwx3

If youre looking for the type of game an accountant would love I think a better bet might be something like Football Manager Cities Skylines or Offworld Trading company. TIS is just a straightforward puzzle game with programming flavor. If youve played Spacechem its almost the exact same type of game. You get data items coming in you have to move them around do something to them and then send items out. You only have a few very simple commands tools you can move items around you can swap a single item into storage you can addsubtract items and you can compare two items.

6846417,0,t1_d0s3njm,If you enjoy these games you will get something from it. I have played all major entries and I finished this last night. But the game can be very clunky at times the missions can be boring and repetitive NPCs are buggy missions can get bugged out if you do things in an order the game isnt expecting etc.Story wise its a fun little adventure with good characters and dialogue but it felt like a lot of stuff was left on the cutting room floor and some mainline missions are shoehorned in because of the time period and the need to reflect the history of that time as opposed to furthering the story. Another thing that bugged me was the Gang Upgrades system. It works fine but it would be nice to have some small cutscene play out after each upgrade that reflects the change in the world. As it is it feels like you are just bumping the numbers up. The cutscenes would have made for a better sense of world buildingprogress. A small feature and a small complaint however.Some of the writing is just plain terrible though mostly the filler content.The game also tries to tie in Hitmanesque missions into key assassination missions which is a nice feature which allows for alternative paths for assassinations but again it can be quite clunky. I think the stealth system needs a major revision in order to be more enjoyable.This ties into the movement. Movement can feel swift at times but stodgy at others. The length of time between input and animation feels far too long particularly with turning around. Perhaps if you play more deliberately you can get past this limitation but after  odd hours of doing the same things to progress that intent will soon fade as you traverse the world.However if you like this series do go play it. A lot of what I have posted seems to be entrenched in the series so you wont be surprised. The grapple hook is fun to use and one of the better implemented mechanics and I enjoyed the campy cartoony historical revisionism they liberally employ with well known historical figures. To me that was what kept me going forward.It is not a great game by any stretch but a big improvement over Unity. Im just waiting for these rough edges to be smoothed out. When you have a game this big and mechanically complex you need a long development time. GTA arguably takes too long to come out but I think the series would have been more consistent and far more critically revered if they ran on a similar schedule. It arguably could be one of the best game series of all time if each game was given more than  years to makemade in parallel with other games in the series.   ,GameDeals,d0scj9r,1,t5_2qwx3

6855150,0,t1_d0t0c7q,Okay Ill ask. Im on my first olaythrough just got the lordvessel and cleared the catacombs and was going through the tomb of the Giants. Got to the bonfire did the patches stuff and opened the fog wall. But I suck at using the lantern and not being able to use my shield. So I went to demon ruins instead because I heard theres a helmet that gives off light there somewhere. My character I think is a Rouge high dex build. Shield and spear with faith up enough to use heal but since I can get  flasks now I think I dont really need that anymore. Im using all silver knight armor and shield and spear with a lightning bow and thoround talisman as secondary. I actually just bought the Ornstein armor and it seems better than silver knight in like every way so Ill probably keep that instead. I keep Havels ring and ring of evil eye. Im level .Next time I go through the tomb of giants Ill try a fire winged spear. I guess just in general any tips for where Im at now? As far as equipment or places to go first or upgrades? I want to get ornstiens spear and I think I can just downgrade the lightning spear to  and use that and his soul at the anor londo smith to get it but not sure. Im trying not to look thinks up but sometimes I double check after I think Ive cleared an area. ,GameDeals,d0tc8eo,1,t5_2qwx3

This game has actually had a lot of love put into it the graphics are excellent and the soundtrack is still beautiful its the way remastered games should be. There has been a lot of legitimate criticism regarding formations not working in Homeworld  this is because the game uses the HW engine. They keep promising a patch to fix it but it still hasnt surfaced.Regardless Id argue that the game is still absolutely worth your time.

What I meant was no one is playing it as it should be played. I can only go by my own experiences but I tried it again a week ago and yeah there were three servers with twenty actual people on. The rest were bots. I was using hyperbole when I said no one played it but it was very low numbers. And it was a mess everyone was trying to be a one man army team killing and basically playing it like cod with muskets. I had fun with it when it came out but now I dont think it is worth the price of entry.

7538347,0,t3_4ikinu,Rampage Knights is decent. Better than the flash game tier artstyle suggests.Its a very simple brawler roguelike. Quotation marks because it punishes death less than the average roguelike and theres very little randomization in the rooms so even at the biggest stretch it doesnt fit it. But its tagged as such anyways.Main claim to fame it has is an item system similar to the Binding of Isaac except uglier and with an actual limit. You get random boots and stuff that change your appearence and give you new abilities for that run.  They range from walking creating fire an attack Parrot a box that traps enemiescreates bridgesis a box depending on how its used to my favorite item a  n american flag looking thing that lets you fly and drop bombs for MP.Its very easy overall  especially on coop it has online but its pretty dead so dont go buying it if you want a challenge.Its actually brawling is pretty meh with a very small moveset that is shared for most classes it has those but assasins instagib on downed enemies and invis that actually works is pretty fun and unique. Its really combining your limited moveset with whatever items you get that makes it fun.Final boss is prolly one of the worst ideas for a final boss Ive seen in a game if not the worst and deserves mention for how impressively stupid it isStill dont think it should be tagged as roguelike though.,GameDeals,d2z2ngc,6,t5_2qwx3

7795568,0,t3_4m0i5g,I played for a while when it first came out got bored and only recently came back. Im now very engrossed in the gameplay. The PvP is some of the most fun Ive had in any game. WvW which is a mode that pits an entire server against another server against another server is very fun and easy to get into for anyone. Stat scaling means that youre never overlevelled for an area so the game is never a breeze. The new endgame content added with the expansion is very challenging and is the first time I genuinely felt challenged in PvE. The story is complete ass any way you slice it and the new characters in the expansion are some of the worst from the I know it all Asura chick to the constantly affectionate My love oh my love lesbian couple with the cringiest romantic dialogue ever to the female Char who looks less like an intimidating feline beast and more like an adorable kitten.For  you cant really go wrong.

The dollar is recovering and PC games are dropping generally but Id be surprised if console games come back down. The digital download prices for console games are the same as their retail prices though they are starting to get more sales.Overwatch was a particularly big gap because there is the PC only option to buy just the game for  USD instead of the Origins edition for  USD while consoles only get the latter.The market for physical console games keeps prices high for instance I got Total War Warhammer for  CDN at release by shopping around online retailers but Steam has it at  CDN while the Amazon.ca listing from Sega has physical at  CDN.,GameDeals,d3us09n,1,t5_2qwx3

8061247,0,t3_4pleoh,I have  hours in the game and Ive enjoyed playing it.However Id advise people not to buy the game at this point. The pvp zone is full of either cheaters griefers or idiots who make going there impossible. The pve part of the game is a lot of fun in my opinion the world is quite interesting and the stories are fun to follow but at the end the lack of variety of gearing up at the end game theres obviously two or three builds that are MUCH better than the rest make this game quite frustrating.I think that if Massive manage to make DZ interesting again although I personally dont see how theyve given griefers the perfect way to annoy others and cheating is something they apparently cannot fix easily the game can be fun for people who are looking for a longterm commitment. At this point buy this only if youre very interested in the world and youre happy to avoid pvp and the gear that comes with it.I bought the game at full price and liked it a lot but Im not buying the Season Pass at this point. ,GameDeals,d4m5rbg,2,t5_2qwx3

8065859,0,t1_d4mkjqy,Its intimidating to be sure but its not nearly as daunting as it seems you dont need an extensive knowledge of every inch of the passive tree most people dont tbh to create an effective build. Just pick a character pick a weapon type pick a skill you enjoy using the game throws tonnes of these at you as you go and have a look at the passive tree for nearby clusters of nodes that benefit that skillweapon the passive tree is actually divided up pretty intuitively nodes are clustered with similar nodes and bigger nodes are more significant than smaller ones  as many  increased life nodes as you can get your hands on.Youre probably not going to make a particularly good build the first time around but the best way to learn the game is simply by playing it no research required.

From Ashes doesnt add a lot but it adds a new squad member who expands the lore of the game a fair bit dont really want to spoil though. Citadel gives you Citadelfocused stuff  some new missions and a ton of new conversation with old squadmates if youre interested in that.I dont really get why everybody whines and whines about the DLC because frankly none of it except maybe From Ashes is really very important or relevant to the main story.,GameDeals,d5ch3vu,0,t5_2qwx3

8426720,0,t3_4v1tg9,Fantastic game!Ive been playing it pretty regularly its one of my favorite FPS games to come out in the past few years. I play mostly by myself but Ive made a couple of friends in game. I play it on PC but Im certain that with friends its a great experience. Population is decent on PC.Siege is really really good one of my favorite FPSes to come out in a long long while. My preference of FPS games is Rising Storm RO Insurgency PVZGW  and some CSGO I stopped playing Cs GO as well because of how upset it made me all the time but its one of my most played games on Steam.Ive been playing Siege since release just by myself other than the free weekend and Ive been having a pretty good time with randoms although like most games like this there will be dickholes who ruin your fun. The game will feel like a clusterfuck in the beginning getting shot through walls or blown up randomly is kind of annoying but the game PLAYS wayyy differently from any FPS Ive ever played. The destruction truly makes every match feel different as you dont know where the enemy will come from. Its some of the most tense combat sequences Ive ever played in a video game.The moving around shooting feels like a really fastpaced Battlefield and the destructible environments are fantastic. Ive never had to worry about people breaching through areas in a room before or have the freedom to enter an area from any direction I want. Its got a really cool realistic destruction component to it have you ever seen the Raid Redemption? Or Dredd? Theres a scene where theres an intense firefight and people are shooting each other through walls shooting through the floor ceiling. Ive knelt next to a wall hearing the enemies reloading guns stomping around and just unloading my shotgun through the wall and getting lucky kills that way. Fantastic sound design probably the best since battlefield s lets you really listen to every single little noise because anything might give away a position.You spend experience on unlocking operators which are essentially heroes from DOTA in a sense. I only played Black Ops s beta but I remember that game having a similar system. The operators lend an interesting tactical element as they all have a neat little special ability they can use such as EMP grenades or little laser traps. Choosing which operators to use is important as some members have interesting synergestic relationships or are good counters against each other.Game isnt perfect however. Ive been randomly kicked from games because of connection errors or itll take an eternity to connect. Ive heard of rampant hacking but Ive yet to encounter any myself and like with most online games there will be griefers idiots who may ruin your fun. Ive also had some weird hitbox issues like frustrating OMG I SHOT YOU IN THE HEAD  TIMES HOW DID YOU KILL ME BY SHOOTING ME ONCE IN THE FOOT kinda deal but generally the game runs well and is stable. Ubisofts latest patches have done wonders to alleviate these issues although there are still some leftover balance issues godamn super  and connection issues. Due to Ubisofts communication with players I believe there is a large patch coming out in April thatll hopefully resolve these problems.Im mostly just astonished impressed that this kind of game even got made. Everyone seems to think that games are now catering more and more to the lowest common denominator that COD doritos mountain dew crowd. However this game is HARD. Theres a lot more patience thinking involved in this FPS and I was under the impression that this kind of game has become so niche Id have to look to indie developers to make games that I want. Games like Squad Insurgency are scratching that itch but this is a triple A title that delivers a deep tactical and rewarding experience. SO far the developers have been good at communicating issues and all future maps will be released for free so thats pretty neat! Id recommend sticking with it until level  you unlock ranked mode which tends to have higher level play ability to vote on insertion defense points.Theres in game voice chat that works pretty well although you should tweak a setting called voice threshold because otherwise your voice will be very very quiet.As for the map design they are fantastic and the highlight of the game. Every map has so many ways that fights can break out so each time the matches feel different. The season pass is also some of the most consumer friendly ive ever seen every map is released for free and all the season pass grants is free access to new operators although these operators are unlockable by the experience points.All in all I highly recommend Rainbow Six Siege the best multiplayer game Ive played last year and this year and I hope to see it have a long and healthy life span. You should consider picking it up if youre fan of challenging tactical shooters with a strong strong emphasis on teamwork. There is a bit of a learning curve but executing a perfectly timed breach like one of those slow motion COD sequences but in blisteringly fast real time against other human players is a crazy and enthralling experience EVERY time. Microphones are an absolutely necessity.,GameDeals,d5uvqqp,4,t5_2qwx3

8576536,0,t1_d6djjfx,Tropico  is very similar. Id only recommend getting  complete pack if you liked  a lot and really wanted some more campaigns and scenarios to play. Which is what I wanted and I was quite pleased.Everythings pretty much the same other than your typical new buildings and a couple of new mechanics water buildings and spy buildingsmechanic. Honestly I never even use the spy stuff and the water buildings feel like a mix between almost too strong or totally useless.The best new mechanic imo is the Dynasty system. You build up a full family and each gets one of the standard perks environmentalist supervisor etc which you can level up with your offshore money which is nice actually gives a purpose for that money now. And they carry over from mission to mission  even outside campaigns. And you can have different ones elected president.They also added managers guys you can assign to each building for perks. Except I couldnt see any way to manage them other than tediously clicking on every building and then if none is assigned going through several more clicks to assign one. Doesnt sound bad except you have to do this for every building  and new managers appear through the course of the game so you have to go through that process every so often if you want to keep gaining the maximum benefit. It really needed some sort of list overview. A good idea poorly implemented imo.Also I didnt like how the campaigns gave you  islands to manage and kept bouncing you back and forth. I found myself forgetting what was going on at each island and sometimes getting annoyed when the silly stuff I had to build to beat the previous mission was cluttering up my island.It seemed like theres fewer cars on the road which makes traffic easier to manage no more planning my islands entirely around minimizing intersections haha. Oddly I found myself sorta missing that I guess maybe it took a layer of challenge away from the whole thing. But I think most people probably wont be bothered by that as much as I was.I highlighted several negatives above but everything that was good about  is still good in  imo so overall I was quite pleased with the game. I still go back and play single missions I havent beat yet and Id say its definitely worth the sale price for the complete pack if you want more of the same.Edit  As a couple people noted in another thread I think  is the strongest of the series although  is really close.  is not quite as good as either  or  but I did still enjoy it as a fan of the series.,GameDeals,d6dnf14,10,t5_2qwx3

Highlights of the series are SQ III and SQ IV which was my introduction to the series Gary Oldman killed it as the narrator. SQ V and SQ   arent quite up to the same standards but still have their moments.Police Quest is definitely a unique experience. PQ  all follow the story of Sonny Bonds and his career with the Lytton PD. Basically theyre the game version of cop shows very detailprocedure oriented which isnt too surprising since the game designer was a California Highway Patrol officer that Ken and Roberta owners of Sierra met while he was recuperating. PQ  goes an entirely different direction as Jim Walls had left Sierra and former LAPD police chief Daryl F. Gates took over. You play as an LAPD detective working a bizarre murdertorture case and a few action scenes are incorporated. Different but interesting.PQ  was my first Sierra adventure and still one of the better of the series with the mysteryinvestigation involved and the Jan Hammer soundtrack.Phantasmagoria amp are definitely acquired tastes. The first game was hugely popular as it hit at the height of FMV adventures. Somewhat mature storyline with the violence involved. Pretty standard horror adventure couple move into isolated house relationship drama ensues weird shit starts happening etc. The nd game took a wildly different direction and got into even weirder and kinkier shit.On the second tier if youre a fan of the oldschool Fallouts at all or Pillars of Eternity youll love Arcanum. Classic RPG set in a steampunk setting tons of world building and lore tons of character building every stat matters.The Quest for Glory series is a ton of fun. Its basically an adventure game with light RPG elements. QFG  is a bit bland but the following games are a lot of fun with some very interesting character building and unique settings. QFG plays with the Arabian Nights setting with a mirrored evil town in addition to the one the story starts in. QFG  moves the story to an African Savannahtribal setting QFG IV one of my favorites plays with TransylvanianEastern European themes and mythos. QFG V is a mixed bag since it was one of Sierras first forays into D adventure games. The control scheme isnt the best and the Ds very dated at this point but the settings still interesting. Basically takes on the classical Greek mythos.Thing I loved most about the QfG series is they didnt take themselves seriously at all. Lots of comedic elements and now dated pop culture references they have fun with.If youre into the supernatural at all youll love Gabriel Knight. The series was created by Jane Jensen who later went on to establish Pinkerton Road studios Gray Matter Moebius.Great games with stories that still hold up well. st game is set in New Orleans and involves a bookstore owner getting dragged into a series of voodoo murders. Tons of story and dripping with atmosphere. As a bonus you get to hear Tim Currys terrible southern drawl.GK is possibly one of the best FMV adventure games ever made. Gabriel Knight winds up in Germany chasing after a series of werewolf sightingskillings. Great puzzles great acting and a good story.GK is a mixed bag. Its another of Sierras attempts at a D adventure game so the controls and camera are wonky at best but it has my favorite story of the entire series. Very well done its essentially an investigation into the legends of the Holy Grail in rural France. Basically a horror story mixed with realworld conspiracy theories and the DaVinci Code.For the other tiers Caesar  and IV are pretty solid city building simulators. The Kings Quest series is a wellknown classic but far and away my absolute favorite of the series is KQ which sees King Graham shipwrecked in the Green Isles which are basically a mashup of all the classic fairy tales from Beauty and the Beast to Alice in Wonderland.I still replay it every now and them.I am a little disappointed that the Sierra Bundle didnt include the Leisure Suit Larry adventure games the classic  series not MCL as they were some of the funniest games Sierra made and not anywhere near as dirty as you may have heard.One thing to note....with the Sierra adventure games you absolutely WILL need the manualsextras that the games came with. Sierra not only was big on manualbased copy protection they did a very good job making them entertaining to read on their own and added in clues to ingame puzzles in stuff like the Space Piston magazine for SQIV or the Famous Adventurers Correspondence Course booklets for Quest for Glory.TLDR If youre solely into graphics these games arent for you. If youre easily frustrated or dont like getting stuck on puzzles or just hate adventure games move on. Otherwise these are still some of the best adventures around.,GameDeals,d73715m,23,t5_2qwx3

8957109,0,t1_d7objyj,Im going to have to disagree. I should preface this by saying that I enjoyed Arkham Origins and I do recommend playing it but in nearly every way it is a step back from Arkham City. Visually the two are comparable and story wise I may actually give Origins an edge over City but the gameplay in Arkham City is much better.At first glance they arent much different which is part of the problem each main installment of the series for better or worse adds lots of new mechanics. City added new enemy types like shield guys stun baton guys and reworked knife fights in addition to disarm and destroy combos instant takedowns? and the ability to counter more than one enemy at a time just to name a few. Knight added dashing and grappling enemies environmental takedowns picking enemies up from the ground into beatdowns fear takedowns and of course the batmobile.Origins added martial artists which are a decent addition and heavily armored enemies but thats really about it. And beyond that they messed with the flow of combat which makes the game harder as enemies attack patterns are harder to predict and less organic. Its hard to describe but after putting  hours into City across  playthroughs you start to notice. EDIT I added this paragraph for some context I didnt really explain what I meant about the worse flow For example the martial artists while a cool addition because they need to be countered  times instead of one have this very annoying animation where they will hit you you counter and then they sort of push batman. Now up until this point and indeed every other enemy in the game shouldnt ever touch you so if you see an enemy take a swing at you instinctively you want to press the counter button. But the martial artists have to be countered after they push you so you see this guy about to push you you press Y to counter but it actually breaks your combo because thats a natural part of the animation and has to happen. Its little stuff like that that really irks me about this game and you can tall that a studio inherited the combat system and didnt fully understand it when they started building on it. In addition to that the only new gadgets detracted from the game in more ways than they add. The disrupter causes enemies to start swinging blindly which more often than not ends up with you being hit because they cant be countered and they attack much faster than they would normally. And the shock gloves are essentially a temporary win button that allows you to bypass all the interesting restrictions cant hit shield guys from the front have to stun armored guys first etc that makes the Arkham series the best at its brand of combat.Like I said Origins is a good game in most respects but at its best it is a mere copy of Citys mechanics and at its worst it can be a step back. Still worth playing though I enjoyed it albeit less than the other games in the series. ,GameDeals,d7oidse,6,t5_2qwx3

9332783,0,t1_d8yzdew,They are excellent games but it is better to get them from GOG if possible since  the GOG versions also come with the older nonenhanced versions as bonuses. Very well worth it at full  price in my opinion. The Enhanced editions come with a lot of quality of life improvements  but some mods are not... quite functional in them since there are some that require TOBEX and that last time I checked does not work with the enhanced ones.  As well as the new content  new npcs and the new expansion being divisive. Personally I did not mind them though Neeras voice is fairly annoying and she tends to be redundant in my party since I like playing with MC being a wild mage but  just with the ZOOM functionality being added to the game made it worth it for me.As far as I know there is no mod out there that replicates that zoom functionality most of the other stuffs except for performance fixes maybe got mod equivalents out there for the classic versions which again as of now  can be acquired from GOGs enhanced editions versionAbout Baldurs Gate Enhanced Edition includes the classic Baldurs Gate The Original SagaFrom what I recall they were also for a while on gog connect so if you had them on steam you could redeem it on gog by linking the accounts and that was ideal.,GameDeals,d8yzy98,14,t5_2qwx3

9437906,0,t1_d9c2pgy,Id have to go with Dark Souls.You have to understand though that Dark Souls story is... unique. It has a lot of elements that are vague or unclear when taken by themselves and things arent just spelled out for you and laid out in a traditional way  there absolutely is a cohesive story there but a lot of it requires you to piece things together. Theres some really intriguing lore in the game but you have to work to uncover and connect a lot of it. If you dont you may end up saying Huh? a lot.Lords of the Fallen is much more straightforward in terms of story and while I wouldnt say that the story in it is bad its probably the weakest element to the game. I honestly just think that it leaves too much out in the way of backstory and context. It makes the motivations of characters extremely unclear even and perhaps especially for your own character.In terms of loot... eh... about the same between the two I guess? Probably a slight edge to Dark Souls I suppose.The main appeal I think is in exploring this bizarre and interesting world and learning to be observant and cautious with every step because death could be around any corner. Its difficult but its fair in that difficulty. When something bad happens you screwed up or didnt notice something  and youll know better next time! It just has a great atmosphere and some extremely intense moments thanks to the higherthannormal difficulty and that makes it all the more satisfying when you succeed.,GameDeals,d9cbkeq,2,t5_2qwx3

9500429,0,t1_d9k2s3l,Your best bet is to look at some videos but Im gonna try my best to describe the combat system in PoE and Divinity.PoE uses a very similar system to the Baldurs GateInfinity engine games so basically its real time with pause use warriors to tank mages to nuke roll to see if you hit. If you like tactical positioning and often microing your party to make it out alive then you will love PoE. At worst you can always slow down the speed of the game if youre having trouble keeping up.Divinity focuses on interactions with the elements which kinda makes a magic focused character a musthave. The combat is turnbased where you use actions points to move and attackuse skills. Again elemental interaction is the name of the game  using electricity to stun a rainsoaked ennemy throwing a fireball in a pool of water to create lineofsightbreaking steam... Its really fun and rewards preparation more than anything.Again look at videos Im not that good at describing stuff ,GameDeals,d9k4p9n,13,t5_2qwx3

Especially if you tweak a couple of variables here and there to make the need for food more forgiving or crafting slightly better x or x it can be quite fun.  Then its just you exploring these wacky dino infested islands building up your base.I guess after a while maybe theres nothing left to learncraftconquer but Ive got  hours in the game and its safe to say at least  of those were single player also known as running your own server locally.

9760924,0,t1_dafzacc,I got a PS code from a friend so we could play together and I love the game. SP and MP are fantastic. Ive been playing it on my PS with very low wait times for matchmaking. Until yesterday when my BrotherinLaw and I were talking and he said he wanted it for PC but none of his friends were planning on buying it due to being consumed with BF.  I had seen that Origin was having a sale on it so I bout us both a copy as an early Christmas present. We were both stoked to get it downloaded and do military parkour and mech battles. I launched the game invited him to my party and started matchmaking like I always do on the PS. For a minute I thought my game client was timing out and stuck in the searching for players  menu. But slowly people tricked in and we had a full game. After that match I was going to troubleshoot the lagtimeouts I thought I was seeing but then I saw that there were only about  people logged in at pm Eastern. My BIL confirmed he was seeing the same numbers. We played three more matches each with a  minute wait. After all of the super deep Black Friday sales I have very little hope for the PC community for the game. My BIL only plays competitive PC FPS games and he plays a ton of them so when he saw that player count I could tell he wasnt going to spend any real time with the game. Its a shame for the whole MP action FPS community in my opinion because Respawn did SO much of what the community asks for but never really gets from AAA titles. They also made a game that is is an absolute blast just to navigate the map. Its the first game with parkour as a central method of movement where it hasnt felt like a chore in the end. The design language of the maps is spoton. It only took me part of my first match to get the feel for the games simplicity. I could keep gushing over Titanfall  until I hit the character limit on Reddit comments. I hope that one day in the future Respawn Devs will speak candidly about why the game committed a suicidal act in releasing it in the the time frame they did. ,GameDeals,dag92m6,1,t5_2qwx3

The biggest thing is that you spend the first  hours or so getting used to the combat. Its a weird mix where its partly statbased dice rolls but they there is also some manual input. It has its own unique rhythm to it that feels TERRIBLE and unresponsive at first and then gets better as internalize the flow of it. The best thing about the game is that there are several main areas and you actually spend enough time in each area to really get to know the surroundings and the NPCs. Its quite detailed and the quests that you complete generally have some effect on the NPCs.,GameDeals,dans6xz,12,t5_2qwx3

9822676,0,t1_danrun8,Theres a bit of a meta game at play with Steam level. Id say this one is actually worth buying for the sole purpose of Trading Cards which give you steam profile levelbadges. Steam level determines a few things most importantly the max size friends list. Each level gives you  more slots.It also determines how frequently you get booster packs which can be sold on the market. You can only receive booster packs for games you own and with games that have trading cards. Every  levels your percentage of receiving a booster pack increases by  up to a  increase at level . Its not all that common Id say I get one a month   games   drop increase. Now trading cards. A lot of games from trading cards in steam. You can craft the trading card into what are called badges which give xp each and a chance at a backgroundemote which can be worth a couple bucks. Each game that you own which has trading cards will eventually give you half of a badge worth of XP. So if a game has  trading cards youll get  random cards possibly duplicates from owning it. You can trade other users for cards youre missing optimal or sell your duplicates on the market and pay a fee. This bundle has  games with trading cards or about . badges  XP. The current cheapest set price is .. So if you get . full sets youre paying  for . worth of badges. While unlikely it could be even more if you get a rare backgroundemotefoil. EDIT Thought I should add my level isnt that high and I dont buy for trading cards anymore. I have hit max friends from trading before so it wouldnt hurt to level it up maybe  more. Im level  which is  XP.  XP of that is from an  year old account xp from the free Community leader badge XP from other assorted freeseasonal badges XP from  games and  from a CSGO badge I crafted long ago for my profile.  ,GameDeals,danwxv9,5,t5_2qwx3

Sure Gothic  was pretty good and felt like a lot more of the same but way bigger  but Gothic  came at the right time w the right setting  story. It was like magic when it came out. Highly recommend Gothic . For Risen series I like Risen  the best of the series. I think Risen  was their best game since Gothic   and since its probably very similar to Gothic  in many ways size depth questing limited area you are in etc thats probably why it felt so great to me. I really dug Risen  for its setting and emphasis on the pirate theme though  extremely well done. Though I think often the amount of choice was better in Risen .Still its hard to go wrong w PBs RPGs though IMHO.,GameDeals,dbg08zf,1,t5_2qwx3

10083705,0,t1_dblwuba,I dont really want to own a tower build in addition to a laptop because I just dont want a tower build period it takes up too much space its louder its more of a hassle it generates more heat and so on. I had tower builds for years but when a monitor died on me a few years ago and I was in need of a new tower build at the same time I decided to just go the laptop route to kill two birds with one stone and Ive never looked back since. I like it so much better than any of my old tower builds and its capable of playing almost every game I throw at it eliminating the only real roadblock I had put up in the past to convince myself to go the tower route instead of the laptop route. Something like a Steam Machine could possibly address some of my concerns  it would certainly take up less space at the very least  but I just dont see the need to go that route. Laptops are perfect for me and Im a patient gamer anyway hell I stopped gaming entirely for about a decade or so so I have plenty of older games to catch up on and the newer ones can wait until the next time I upgrade my laptop if I dont go for them on the PS instead at which point Ill be set again for a while in terms of the games Im able to play on it.That said everything you pointed out about how the console and PC gaming landscapes have evolved over the past decade or two is true of course. My comments on console gaming feeling more natural to me were really just meant as an aside its not something that factors into my purchases very often if at all but it is something Im aware of.,GameDeals,dblxc7j,0,t5_2qwx3

It was easy to jump in and out of and the time spent on it went by quickly. One big thing I didnt like is that it felt like the map was too crowded with meaningless collectibles. Theres a temptation to pick up every chest and war ribbon and newspaper you see until you realize they serve no real purpose and running to get them is a waste of time. I didnt mind stopping to pick up every chest in Black Flag but this time they went way overboard.

It feels like the early part of the first game.Its more about running through the world and less about combat which is a good thing and you cant be shot so long as youre moving fast. But since its open world the levels are simpler and you dont have the wonderful level design of the first game and youre almost reliant upon runner vision to get to where you need to go.

10776890,0,t1_ddqag1z,I would say no. I mean if you REALLY liked Baldurs Gate youd probably enjoy this for the most part but I felt that the game was too sparse to really get into the story. Another annoying thing was making so many kickstarter NPCs so if you talk to someone you get this great backstory on who they are but at the same time it goes nowhere. In fact I think it made the rest of the game seem more bland and it was annoying not being able to really interact with them in any other way. It had a lot of potential and was pretty fun at the beginning but that fun dropped off for me in about hour . ,GameDeals,ddrk47p,1,t5_2qwx3
10777334,0,t1_ddrlmwt,Well thats... disappointing lol.. I really dont know how to account for it.  I know its generally considered a very poorlyoptimized port as with the entire trilogy but I figured my machine would be able to power through it.. but apparently not.And I was running the game at  resolution even got a GeForce GTX .. as I said originally it wasnt a huge problem for me most of the time in FF.. it was fps for much of my playthrough.  And I did notice that if it did drop turning off the minimap often sent the framerate right back to .  The only time I couldnt really fix that was in the effectheavy combat late in the game.The real problem was so far FF where the framerate just would not settle in anywhere good and was more often than not struggling to hit fps.. ,GameDeals,ddrlrgr,1,t5_2qwx3

10802071,0,t1_ddu46rl,It is a subscription service but you can cancel it after the first payment. The way it works is that every month they show one game usually a fairly big one and then at the end of the month they release the bundle with some more games usually fairly small indie type games and they reveal the next big game.Personally I get the bundles only if the main game is something I want for that price since usually the small games arent things I play much.,GameDeals,ddu5o8v,1,t5_2qwx3

I agree that the original graphics should have been an option and judging by the down votes my last comment got clearly people dont think like I do.

10870033,1,t1_de131yq,While the third game is technically and gameplaywise great its not exactly the GTA equivalent the game series is known for. Its very over the top and most of the missions are just gimmicky minigames. The whole game world is lacking in detail and most of the places are just copypasted over and over again. Its a nice silly game if you have no prior experience in this type of open world games but dont expect it to play like GTA.Saints Row  is the absolute peak of the series IMO. Its way more detailed than any other games of the series. The game world is well designed with plenty of memorable locations character creation is way more complex than in the later games and theres plenty of other features that cant be found in the later games.Theyre all good games but Saints Row  is the game you want if youre looking for a great open world actionadventure game. Just remember to install Gentlemen of the Row mod it will fix most of the performance issues caused by crappy optimization.,GameDeals,de16057,3,t5_2qwx3
10870191,0,t1_ddz5bse,Agree . Lower tier bundle sites catch a lot of flak from people in this sub but this bundle is the combination of quality price and variety that makes bundle hunting so interesting.Have played BOD Cthulhu and Postal . All above average in their class. Tempest and Parvaneh were on my wishlist. Im happy to buy this. EDITSo I just had a more thorough look at the rest of the games here and this bundle looks awesome. I just poked around the videos and pictures on steam and didnt read reviews so their could be horrible game breaking issues with some of them but barring thatCamp Sunshine Looks awesome just for an aesthetic standpoint but game play and it factor seem very good as well. Cutesy horror adventure pixel game. Installing!Projector Face is immediately intriguing. Has that shaky doodle watercolor pencil art style that often attaches itself to a quality game. Promises quirky point and clicking. Hopefully brief and simple?Taiku Mansion looks like a lofi notsoscary horror adventure. Probably average overall but better than a lukewarm cat puke you find on the carpet  minutes after stepping in it. Worth a look especially for genre fans.DeVoid has mixed reviews but good looking screenshots and an interesting plot summary. Definitely a crap shoot and probably the type of game that smells of a developer overreaching with their ambitions. Could be a sleeper though.SQUAKE looks colorful and fast. Often bad traits in a significant other but good in a lot of video games. Could be twitchy!And to utoggak sorry to jump on your post like this. I got way more excited by this bundle than I had anticipated. The mixture of quirky horror and pixel games struck a nerve. Cheers D,GameDeals,de16l8n,1,t5_2qwx3

For amazing retro goodness Underrail has a lot of meat for a great price and Wasteland  is good if you can catch it on sale.  Oh!  And Dungeon of the Endless!  Super creative and a game that will drive you to smash your keyboard  and come back for more.Management Sims For some cheaper hidden gem types check out Recettear or Holy Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?!  Theyre not AAA but theyre cute time fillers.  Also Holy Potatoes has a really cool FTLlike sequel.Sandbox The HP Lovecraftstyled Dont Starve franchise is bizarre fantastic and even had great coop play.ARPG Victor Vran on the more satirical side and the Van Hellsing franchise on the more serious end.  They all have great depth Vran had some cool coop and Van has an even more indepth single player side than Vran does.Random goodness Dungeon Souls is a really badass albeit sometimes simple roguelite.  Also check out Rebel Galaxy for what is honestly the best singleplayer spacefaring adventures on Steam.  Parts of it can be a bit repetitive the resource gathering but cruising the galaxies is downright beautiful even on lowerend machines and the spaceship fights are a blast.You can find all those games on good sales if youre patient and hopefully Ive pointed you at a few that are new to you!Edit  And sorry if my formatting is a bit confusing in that list especially with the titles  Im on mobile right now.,GameDeals,dezsrqy,3,t5_2qwx3

11375789,0,t1_dfleiqu,So Ive played Berseria Zestiria and have gotten like an hour into Symphonia.I played Zestiria first of the three and I did enjoy it a lot. Sunk roughly  hours into the game just playing through the story and doing all of the sidequests. Gameplay is super solid but the actual story in terms of pacing and cohesiveness is kind of all over the place and a lot of the characters outside of a select few are really hard to actually care about. Its worth the  odd dollars its at right now IMO but I would watch some gameplay first if I were you before making that decision. Berseria is set roughly  years before the events of Zestiria and wow is it good. A lot of the plotcharacter issues I had with Zestiria were fixed in this and the game also fleshes out and ties up a LOT of plot points in Zestiria that made littleno sense. Plus not being required to have  humans in your party at all times makes the combat a bit more interesting. I would highly recommend Berseria at this sale price even if you have no interest in the other games. If you do pick up both I would say play Berseria first. It will make waaayyy more sense playing through Zestiria and make you care about some of the side characters and plot lines a lot more. Now Symphonia... I have heard nothing but good stuff about this game but man when I tried to play it it just did not seem to have aged well for me. Maybe its that the MKB controls are weird but I could not get through the first prologue mission before putting it down. If you think you can handle it Id say go ahead. I definitely have not given it the chance it deserves but I might have ruined it for myself too by playing the other games first.,GameDeals,dflfcsn,1,t5_2qwx3

Its an established standard and there are a ton or resources available. I think this is more a symptom of bad management at Valve. Ive heard it said several times that people there are told to go work on whatever they are interested in which is why a lot of shit never gets fixed. OpenID should take any half way competent developer a day or two to implement  with maybe a few more days to test it.

It really shows how dark and deep the storytelling was back then. And they just turned it into something terribly generic. I had so much fun with the SC campaigns but I was disappointed in the story with each one.,GameDeals,dgg9842,1,t5_2qwx3

Although Pro Pilkki is more inferior in terms of graphics its a pretty realistic ice fishing game. And its freeware and with a healthy player base!,GameDeals,dgiln5t,1,t5_2qwx3

11671953,0,t1_dgiy8i9,The first four are available now. Unfortunately its kind of useless to speculate when the fifth and final episode will be released considering that there was a year gap between the third and fourth. Hopefully it wont be that long this time but who knows? No reason not to pick up a free copy if youre already a Prime subscriber though. Its the full game so the final act is included whenever it ends up releasing.,GameDeals,dgj15wt,7,t5_2qwx3

11749035,0,t1_dgrs1hk,There is absolutely no team work unless youre a team of five. Which makes the game even more boring for me but the game is a super dumbed down game.  It is very hard for one player to carry since it is all so cookie cutter and artificially limited by lack of items and true advantage.It is the same thing with Overwatch it rips off team fortress but it is dumbed down.  I like Overwatch a lot more but it is so damn easy and simplified its not something I can play for a long time.Now if I had a fiveman group things would be much better all these styles of games play infinite better with a full team of friends.,GameDeals,dgrs6fz,-8,t5_2qwx3

11787245,0,t1_dgvqkpa,I think so but its not going to be majorly cheaper in dollar values anyways? Dealzon shows lowest at   months ago at Bundle Stars ITAD shows   months ago at Humble StoreIn fact it was  cheaper earlier this year during what Im assuming was Bundle Stars prolonged winter sale. Not sure what ITAD isnt showing it since they track Bundle Stars too. Anyways I agree with ujoelanator that  is pretty good  but if you want absolutely best deal itll come around again.,GameDeals,dgw4ggd,4,t5_2qwx3

After it finally came out what felt like half a decade later I read that it was significantly worse than the first part and completely lost any interest to ever finish it.,GameDeals,dgx7ww5,3,t5_2qwx3

I had GBs of RAM ik and GTX ti when I played it and it was completely fine had very minor frame drops when going mph in the batmobile which was understandable. But I had a problem with my RAM months later and had to swap a stick out and went back down to GBs but everything else is the same. Tried playing it again and I was getting stuttering and frame hitching left and right. I couldnt make it  minutes before turning it off it was so bad.,GameDeals,dgyb9h8,2,t5_2qwx3
