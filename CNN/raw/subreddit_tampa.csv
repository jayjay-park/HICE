The flip side being if you just find a new job in the area you probably arent going to put in the effort to move five or ten miles closer...Iffy public transportation is a big downside though.ETA Traffic is not all that bad unless you need to get over a bridgecauseway and something gets fucked up.

2420314,0,t3_2n3tvt,I lived in Tampa from  to  and am now back from an extended stay in Maine. I was single for most of my stay the first stay but now have wife kids dogs etc etc. So I have a solid grasp on Tampa.Caveat Originally I was raised in Miami so take what I say with a grain of salt as Im still a dickheaded city kid at heart even with the stay in a very rural area of Maine.Firstly Tampa is nothing like Jacksonville. The old saying goes The further north you go in Florida the further South you get.Women Mixed bag. You wont find that Southern Belle kind of woman here but you will find refinement which can be good or bad depending upon the kind of companionship youre after. Definitely a lot of independent women here as well. Many women here have realized most guys are more trouble than theyre worth so they get their shit together before going after husbands. If youre just looking for a fwb then you can also find those but as with everything be safe. As long as youre respectable hygienic and can actually be amicable youre good. Avoid the New Yorkan chicks as you will fucking regret it sorry ladies personal opinion. Dating can be great here as there are many places little or small to go. Good restaurants plenty of touristy hotspots beaches theaters live or cine and the weather to confidently pull a good night. Lots of Cubans here but Tampa is full of other Caribbean peoples so keep an open mind when interacting with people. A general rule of thumb When strangers meet great allowances should be made for differences of custom and training. Plenty of white people as well more so than Miami. Its really a solid mixture of people.Crime Eh. Mind you Im from Miami born and raised during the s and s so I have a different view than lifelong residents. With that said it isnt bad at all. I wouldnt leave my keys in the car with the windows down but I wouldnt get an ulcer if I didnt lock the doors in my car either. Just be aware of your surroundings be polite with your neighbors dont make an excessive scene and youre good. Carrying a weapon isnt necessarily needed but pay attention to the areas youll be going to.Lifestyle Laid back. You wont get the hectic uptightness of New Englanders but you also wont get the open friendliness of some southern states like NC or SC. The weather allows for plenty of outdoor activities as Tampa is situated in a part of Florida that allows for camping hiking and the like. Like I said Florida is tourist central. You have Disney Cape Canaveral my personal fav and other big theme parks near enough so you can go and come back in a day. As for beaches meh. You can always drive to the Keys  hr drive and really experience a Caribbeanlike vacation without blowing up your wallet. Roads are solid all through the state and for the most part devoid of the stopngo traffic you see in places like Miami. Of course driving during rush hours in any city sucks but there are plenty of workaround roads here. Anywho good luck with everything Broseidon King of the Brocean. Its a good city and I think youll be glad you moved here.,tampa,cmauygl,3,t5_2r7ih

You probably dont want to live super close to that office because of crime and commercial blight. Look into Seminole Heights if you want to live in a nearby urban environment think Fountain Park or Irvington or Brandon if you want something more surburban Carmel or Greenwood.

4743162,0,t3_3fvrs3,Talk to your insurance company and let them send out a real engineer to do the inspection. Do not under any circumstances call a contractor to do an inspection. Their entire business model is predicated on turning people like you into customers whether you need the work or not. Also look up any engineering firm your insurance company uses to make sure they are legit.Once you have a confirmed sinkhole you will be inundated with contractors trying to sell you on their services. Beware most of them are shady and will not do a good job.The sinkhole industry is basically one big scam at this point with very few legit players. The contractors you hire to do your repairs both sinkhole and remediation are the very last person you will hire in this process. Right now you need your insurance company and their engineer to do testing and make a determination about your problem. Once that is done you can get a secondary engineering opinion if you arent satisfied with the report your insurance companys engineering company gives you.Stay away from contractors until you have a report saying you need repairs and your insurance company tells you they will pay for it.I was in the sinkhole industry for a while and watched it turn into the mess it is now.P.S. Do not hire a public adjuster unless your insurance company decides to be a huge pain in the ass. The  they take comes out of your cosmetic repair budget the insurance company does not pay them separately. Same goes for lawyers.,tampa,ctsf51l,7,t5_2r7ih

I am a product of the integrated schools of Pinellas County and so is my SO.Ill start w my SOs story because mine really has no relevance. She moved to Largo from STL in  she was sent to a high school in South St. Pete thanks to the fantastic choice program s.From there she got into fight after fight after being picked on for being one of the only white girls until she was finally expelled and sent to secondary school.  She attended secondary school for a while until she had enough and dropped out. The choice program and integrated schools as well as the Pinellas county school district help set her up to fail. I know its not all their fault but it was a large part of the problem.She had to get up a  am to catch the bus much like the kids that attended my school from South St. Pete. Tell me how is that fair to make a child take a bus  miles to school when there is a school possibly a mile away?Allowing children to go to school close to home promotes a community saves the tax payers on transportation costs and allows children to be close to home and families in case of emergency.The problem isnt self segregation the problem is with how the school system awards higher graded schools more money than lower graded schools. Instead of helping the schools with more funding for better equipment texts and teachers they are continuing to allow them to exist w less support than other schools who may not need it.,tampa,cu4jhcs,-1,t5_2r7ih

5410642,0,t3_3p48l4,I got this vibe before I even looked up the reviews online. I guess I made the right choice.Im in the midst of switching careers. I was originally a nursing student out of college and decided to piss away a full scholarship for my BSN. I worked in the field for a few years and ended up with a higher education and degrees in business. I had an experience recently with a dying family member that has inspired me to enter the field albeit a bit nontraditionally.I was amazed at how this school was so selective with particular transfer courses they would accept. For example I eventually discovered that they would only consider transfer credits for four specific courses. This isnt after a review or transcript eval the rep told me the names of four classes theyd accept for transfer and that was it. Period. And this was after the correspondence I received from them AND an online rep told me something totally different.I am keen on attending a forprofit institution since money is not an issue and I dont enjoy the selection process at HCC nor do I want to be on campus with the kids at a major four year university. I was seriously considering Galen but there has already been communication issues with scheduling and keeping an appointment with an advisor. I feel like that is a red flag already.Was there another school that you wish you would have went to in the area? Right now Im looking to maximize my transfer credits and do an ADN program and then an RN to MSN bridge from a major four year university.,tampa,cw39pdj,2,t5_2r7ih

8384814,0,t3_4udchx,The real temp stays about C or below. Being next to the coast you get humidity which causes a higher feels like temp or heat index. Ive seen the heat index over C. This lasts a few months. Theres several of C. For a period of about a week or two in the winter it drops to about C then jumps back up to C really quick. A lot of the town are avoid areas based on the allowance you have. Theres a crime map over on the right. Id suggest personally looking into Northdale northern Temple Terrace Hyde Park or Carrollwood areas. Youll be able to get a decent house at that price. If you go for an apartment at kmo you can pick pretty much anything in the area. Id recommend a house with a pool if you like to swim or entertain. As for what Americans think of the Dutch you have a funny accent and youre from Europe. Thats about it. Especially this area since theres a lot of influx of people coming in. Ive had friends from Holland Germany Iceland and others. As for car the BMW would be fine. Id instantly label you as someone to go around since if youre in a BMW Lexus or other high end car you probably drive slow. Odds are youre going to need to do some driving from a decent living place to work avoid an SUV they guzzle gas and were usually above average in the nation on price. Better to get a sensible sedan since traffice can get bad at times. Not really dumb questions some of my own questions with scouting job ops elsewhere. Unfortunately americans are a lot less favorablely viewed in other countries. Hope this helps.,tampa,d5pnezg,2,t5_2r7ih

If you really want to get in radio look at it as a hobby or part time. Better yet start your own podcast if being on air is what you want to do. Youll have creative freedom that way and it will be more enjoyable. Edit I went to this school but in a bigger market. Its just an expensive way to get your foot in the door or get an internship.

However I thought this note about the survey was interestingFor the glans penis circumcised men reported decreased sexual pleasure and lower orgasm intensity.Im very curious as to how they measure this.  Orgasm intensity could vary due to many things arousal level how long the penis is stimulated how long it has been since the last orgasm.  If you jerk of for two hours once a week it will surely be a more intense orgasm than if you have a  minute jerk every day.  Also the study had many many more uncircumcised responses.It seems like the research is all over the place on the topic.  Here is a metaanalysis of  studies done with the overall conclusion being that there was no difference in sensitivity and sexual function between circumcised and uncircumcised penises. ,tampa,ded87qf,1,t5_2r7ih

11133722,0,t3_5yx9jm,OP these comments are misleading. Yes the are like two stories of sinkholes opening up so it has happened. But sinkholes pretty much do not exist. What geologists are referring to when they say Florida is full of sinkholes is sinkhole activity which is the systematic weakening of soils beneath your house caused by raveling down into the limestone base. When this happens your house doesnt fall into a hole there is no hole just loose soil. So your house kind of settles. You start seeing hairline cracks in the drywall your garage floor becomes slightly unlevel etc. It is nothing to panic about as long as your house isnt under threat of imminent collapse. You can get insurance for this. And theyll pay to have a contractor come pump grout under your house stabilization and fix all those hairline cracks etc. cosmetic repairs. There is not a hole opening up under your house. There would need to be some freak scenario for that to happen. Sinkhole activity is quite common but its not dangerous.  ,tampa,detzwf4,0,t5_2r7ih
