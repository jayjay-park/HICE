7342094,0,t1_d2cqnd9,No doubt. I was just curious about the picture talking about embracing capitalism by supporting Trump. It really didnt make sense.Obviously people may not  agree or even support trump. I was just curious. Hes still an excellent candidate nonetheless. And arguably the  choice on the GOP side of things. But theres plenty of other candidates that support capitalistic views.As I said hes my  pick primarily because hes an antiestablishment candidate. Him Sanders and most of the rd parties.You said medicine is one of his weak points but I actually like his views on healthcare stuff. IIRC hes big on deregulating medicine and pushing it to be more free market.And yea hes definitely weak on tech. I dunno if that was just him saying shit and in reality hes consult or if he strongly backs what hes said and pushes those IMO insane views. Ive been disliking Obama due to his strong push on govt spying censorship antiwhistleblowing etc. I certainly wouldnt want a candidate that continues that stuff.,RightwingLGBT,d2cqv3i,3,t5_3dc8i

All major religions have a problem with homosexuality and those that can act in it do. It was outlawed in the US for a very long time and only fully legalized recently and even then not fully. Look at the cluster fuck which is the bathroom laws. I fail to see how Muslims are the sole group that you are getting angry at. Further rape and murder rises in poverty and war torn countries and impacts the citizens even after they flee. Where is the hate for the murder and raping occurring in central Africa?

Theres a lot of overlap for sure but I cant relate to a trans man or woman like I can to a gay or bi man or even a lesbian.  Its through no fault of yours or those like you. It just makes absolutely no sense to me. That said Ill fight for your right to be whatever you need or want to be regardless of how I perceive it. Thats why I cant handle the left.

9283942,0,t1_d8s2gk8,I agree that I do not want people in my life who judge me off my political affiliation. The sad thing is these are men in their s and s also acting like bratty children about conservatives. At any other time I would think its nuts. But CA and Especially SF  Silicone Valley is a haven for liberals hippies activists progressives and Bernie bros. These people are quite caustic with their judgement. I am talking about people who were sweet and caring before who have now dropped ignored or gotten mad at me. I have lost many supposed friends this election cycle. Weather dating hooking up or even friends it is a hot issue used to filter not matter how quiet about it I am. Word spreads like wildfire and your get that scarlet letter after a while. The strange thing is my straight friends seem more whatever and tolerant than the gay friends I know. I think CA has quite more than  liberals maybe in the s. I have friends in the midwest  south and they do not get how anyone can be like this. They even get the religion part more as its part of their culture. I agree fragile drama queens who love pride gay activities and have joined the BORG resistance is futile. They dont even know why they believe what they believe. Your with them or against them. Which is weird because they are so open minded to all cultures and progressive issues. This is why I find it hard to meet gay men I goto Log Cabin Republicans and there is no one date able there many are married or of a different mindset percentage of a small percentage  minority. Most gay activity groups have died with the advent of apps even many bars are closing down. Why goto a bar and spend money if they can filter and get something easily. Try it before you buy it they are having sex with many people to see if anyone has a huge dick big bank account amazing job or other networking sugar daddy opportunities. Having lost many gay friends over this election cycle I find most of my friends straight. I organized a large gay outdoor group for  years and then Grindr and the apps hit ... the attitude was why even bother with a social group when they could find someone to hike fuck and underwear exchange with using their filters and preferences. We live in a different world now of Starbucks and instant customized experiences. If you dont fit that mold as a conservative it is another reason to reject us. Keep plowing through too funny many of the bottoms I date are the most outspoken for Hillary and do this behavior. I dont see this getting better especially if Hillary gets in for the next decade. Its like guys now days are looking for another criteria or filter to reject you with. This behavior is perpetuated with Grindr and even on dating apps. Customized perfect guy or why try. These same dudes are fucking multiple people on the apps and then on their dating profiles seem like they are Mother Theresa. I also wrestle with posting that I am a trump follower on apps and social media even dating apps Which are the same as the gay apps and have the same people  small small world even in a place like SF. I am not overly political but I am concerned about my future and what will happen to me with Hillary. I have dated liberals and the non political before but this election cycle seems to perpetuate hate. I dont see it getting better. Look at BLM and Blue lives matter flame is being fed to the fire.

Turkey is a recent example that democracy cannot survive in a Muslim context. Maybe Iran was briefly democratic in the s but no other ArabMuslim country was a democracy. The Arab spring created by idiot Obama is the proof for failure of democracy in the Muslim world. And I will use Egypt as the example idiot Obama instead of supporting Mubarak secular let him fall. Elections were held and a crazy Muslim was elected Morsi only to be shortly  months to be replaced by a new very good tyrant ASisi.God forbid if Morsi was running Egypt today!!! Bottom line Mubarak is a free man found not guilty. Democratically elected Morsi in jail found guilty and will soon be executed. ASisi is a great leader so far supports Israel. More than  of Egyptians are illiterate DID YOU KNOW THAT? And you want democracy for Egypt? Maybe in  years from now.The path to democracy among Muslim and Arabic country is only one way a firm brutal SECULAR tyrant who will be brutal mostly against the religious crazies.Unfortunately USACarter destroyed that chance in Iran by removing the great and admired Shah of Iran.

Ive never seen an FtM masculine enough to be physically attractive to me and like even if they were I dont think dick implants exist yet. Maybe someday but not with current technology.

Regardless we have feminists in The West who are also apologists for Islam.The author of this article Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a feminist in the purest sense. However as a vocal critic of Islam she is often admonished by Western feminists. An example of one such woman is Linda Sarsour cochair of the Womens March an advocate for Sharia Law willing to defend the illegality of women driving in Saudi Arabia Tweeted an attack at Ali and Brigitte Gabriel saying I wish I could take their vaginas away. Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a victim of female genital mutilation. Shes already had parts of her female anatomy taken away due to the barbarism perpetuated by Sarsours religion. What kind of a monster could say something like that to an FGM victim? Brigitte Gabriel is a survivor of the Lebanese Civil War. Islamic militants attacked a military base near Gabriels home. All but the bomb shelter built underneath the house was destroyed forcing her and her family to live in the x bunker for seven years.People are under attack for speaking out against the violence and oppression of women in Islamic cultures.
