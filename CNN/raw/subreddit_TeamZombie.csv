5025705,0,t3_3jl71b,Week one is in the books! Sorry for my gain fellow zombies. Im sure itll work itself out. I started taking creatine again and didnt eat too great Thursday so I was not surprised by the gain. Finished a run this morning and am going to try not to go too crazy this weekend with the holiday. Have a good week everyone stay strong!,TeamZombie,curselv,1,t5_39rey
