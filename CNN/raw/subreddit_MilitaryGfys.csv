The MRAP is elevated from the ground by a very high lifted chassis reducing effective blast power significantly and has a V shaped hull to redirect and deflect the majority of the blast.

2176957,0,t1_clgiyri,This one time at yacht camp. I was in a m yacht in the Irish sea. I was part of a sailing club and we were doing a race from Douglas Isle of Man to Whitehaven England and got caught by a storm that ripped in from the North. It wasnt meant to be a big blow so five out of ten yachts went out. We were really keen to get on the piss for the weekend.  Anyway we tried to make our way back to harbour in Douglas after spending a few hours in increasing seas and getting nowhere.  The ownercaptain didnt do much maintenance to his yacht I found out afterwards and this would be our downfall.  Coming back into Douglas harbour the shallow bottom meant the waves which had previously peaked at about m were now topping m and it was getting very dangerous. I went forward to reef the storm jib and had to hold the stays as the waves were swamping the bow and I had tons of water on top of me each time we hit a wave.  We were making our way in and I wish I was at the helm the captain was pointing us straight down the face of each wave and losing control on the surf down he should have been quartering.  Suddenly there was an almighty crack and the boat started to turn broadside to the waves.  The rudder had snapped clean off.  So there we are. In seas about as bad as I had ever been in with no control at all. The boat slowly turning broadside and threatening to capsize and start rolling into the rocky shore.  We quickly whipped the little hp motor out from the cabin and installed her in the little hole she goes in which I cant remember the name of.  This gave us enough steerage way to keep the bow headed into the waves but we were still slowly being pushed into shore.  I got onto the RT and called the harbourmaster on CH and begged for the lifeboat to be sent out. Then got on my phone and called my flatmate who was on the crew and told him of our situation.  Luckily he was at the yacht club he was meant to come out with us but had been on one of the yachts that hadnt sailed.  We were about  min from crashing onto the Tower of Refuge when they managed to reach us.  A line was thrown...again...again.  Finally we managed to catch it and secure it to some cleats and were taken in tow into the inner harbour.  Last time I ever sailed with that guy.,MilitaryGfys,clgjljk,7,t5_32br2

A Griffin is a longer engagement and seconds can really matter. FWIW im a more recent product of the gunship community so I was more or less trained as PGWs are an excellent tool. There are way more limitations to them though. You have a higher CDE no fire headings factors where you are shining the laser and so on. Dangermy opinion The mm is extremely capable and should stay.

3721620,0,t1_cqgg3fz,I can think of a few reasons to chose this over putting wheels on the ground. Im sure helo pilots can come up with better reasons. For practicing the ability to land troops on places the helicopter cannot land. Buildings rough terrain low obstacles etc Maintaining a higher position for the gunners to cover the landing party. Maintaining a high power setting for quick egress. Maintaining the ability to move quickly in any direction. Separating the group into two targets vs putting every asset in the same place. Lesser trained people dont tend to think in D and might not even think to engage the helicopter as they might not think of aircraft as something they can fight against. Also helo in the air is scarier than helo on the ground. The slightest psychological effects to gain the slightest advantages can add up. The troops can still get out fairly quickly. Theres a two second separation between guys. With two ropes they can probably land a person per second. Thats a fairly decent rate. Reducing the downwash felt by the people on deck making it easier for them to work. Improving the mobility of guys on the ground.

5620322,0,t1_cwthqlp,wikipedia to the rescuegtA vapor cone also known as shock collar or shock egg is a visible cloud of condensed water which can sometimes form around an object. A vapor cone is typically observed as an aircraft or object flying at transonic speeds. When the localized air pressure around the object drops so does the air temperature. If the temperature drops below the dew point a cloud forms.gtIn the case of aircraft the cloud is caused by supersonic expansion fans decreasing the air pressure density and temperature below the dew point. Then pressure density and temperature suddenly increase across the stern shock wave associated with a return to subsonic flow behind the aircraft. Essentially the tail of the aircraft is in supersonic flight while the bow is still flying subsonically and is said to be in transonic flight.,MilitaryGfys,cwtr6kk,3,t5_32br2

5894363,0,t1_cxs8k74,Here it is best as I can understand it if anyone has some corrections by all means inform me.Its kind of hard but basically the TAM  TMS which is also written as TSM same tank just different designations.The designations are semilogical but theyre very confusing. For example the T family goes T gt TM export model TA gtTM export model TB gt TBU TNotice how the upgrade from B to BU isnt to the TU its to the BU as in its a upgrade of the B not just the T in general. Similar with the T TB TU TUMYou begin to have upgrades of upgrades hence the confusion. Why are they not new models? I honestly dont know. Multiple models have been ignored in this history these were the main production models The TS is a TB for export with less ERA and some other changes? The S in roughly means upgraded and for export in regards to tanks from Uralvagonzavod.The TS is a sort of hybrid between the basic and the A variant physically originally meant for export. The TAM is an upgrade of the A variant and the TMS is an M variant upgraded and meant for export.The real fuckery comes in to play with half the almost identical export versions getting their own designations and some of them not getting designations and some of the designations not being official. Example the TSA is a TS modified for Algerian service a T upgraded for export upgraded for Algerian service. Designation Object SA with the A no longer meaning just upgrade and being placed after the model name but denoting Algerian model at the end of the designation. ,MilitaryGfys,cxsa9xs,18,t5_32br2

6140271,0,t1_cynj4ii,Maybe thats the case in a nuclear war but the projection of force they allow is worth their cost alone. The only extreme endurance drone I can think of is the Global Hawk and that doesnt carry any weapons. So those drones have to take off and land somewhere. Not all conflicts are near friendly bases so the ability to park a full airport near the battle helps out immensely. Not only that putting a carrier with an air wing as capable as a lot of countrys entire air force is a good deterrent. This is for peacetime operations and any conflict avoided is worth it.Meanwhile the navy has been testing what you suggested in the X A carrier born stealth attack drone. But no long range stealth drones exist in the public domain at least and I dont think there will ever be a day where computers are allowed to launch nuclear weapons without human intervention so the days of launching a swarm of drones from your couch and then having a beer while your enemies die horrible deaths are still pretty far off. If you want to talk about the ASW and the US weve been screwed since Johnny Walker sold the US sub secrets and information on our ability to track Russian subs to pay his gambling debts. Since then Russia has been releasing progressively quieter subs. Im not saying that was all from him but he sure helped that along.

I suppose that irritates people who would prefer to just have pure real footage.However...Movie Monday submissions do also see a lot of upvotes often more than legitimate real footage which indicates to me that theyre popular with the general audience and its just a relatively few purists who dislike it.The ideal solution would be to have a flair filter button but I feel like even that might not appease people who are really deadset in their opposition to the concept as a whole.Other thoughts might be worth being more strict about timing of MM posts and maybe implementing a one MM post per Monday per user policy to avoid flooding.,MilitaryGfys,d73izs4,15,t5_32br2

10105950,0,t3_5klqvz,Full clip here Copying a comment I made in another post about the paratroopers for some background infoI thought Id share it since its the first time the Swiss military has created any video remotely decent.Some background on the military in Switzerland  In Switzerland all men are required to serve in the military when they hit  usually when the graduate their senior year of high school.  Duration of training varies based on a number of factors unit how far you intend to go etc... but generally you can serve as little as  days.Some background on the unit   The scout paratroopers are one of two special operations units in the Swiss military militia service. Their role is primarily reconnaissance and unconventional warfare with a special emphasis put on operation behind enemy lines. They are trained to work and operate in small units of  guys. The unit is the only one in the entire Swiss military militia to receive jump training. Every year a mere  men graduate the program.  As a quick side note the paratrooper designation should not be confused with that of other countries. The unit is primarily a reconnaissance unit with airborne capabilities.  They would probably be best compared to the UK SAS or the French CPA .,MilitaryGfys,dbotezn,7,t5_32br2

11013029,0,t1_deg6tvy,Yeah that guy confused you. Board shorts are made from a very lightweight soft synthetic blend that is almost nonabsorbant so they dont get wet and heavy like most fabrics do you know? And then they all come with an inner layer that is sewn in and thus permanent. This layer is a very very lightweight porous netting type synthetic fabric that again holds no water. In the end you have a pair of soft very flexible incredibly lightweight Id guess a complete pair weighs like .oz or something crazy light like that synthetic shorts that when wet dont get heavy and waterlogged dont have much trouble transitioning from dry to wet and back again very quickly on an average warm summer day they dry out fully in under  minutes if you just get out of the water and dont dry them with a towel so they dry very fast and are comfortable enough to wear in relaxed casual beachswim type settings even if you arent getting in the water. Also that fabric netting lining inside? It also is used to make pockets so thats something you may not know either. Board shorts all have pockets! Some of them have front back and lower cargostyle pockets. So you have  pockets to carry tons of stuff around while wearing nothing but sandals and shorts all day and you can transition to the water any time you want then get back out air dry in  minutes and then continue on with your relaxing casual day. Once you try them you really get a better feel for them. Also there are so many different brands and models out there that you can find whatever you want ones with more pockets and an iPhone holder and a place for headphones to be wired in so you can have your waterproof iPhone cased phone and headphones in while surfing or whatever or you can get very very simple light ones with no pockets and less extra baggy fabric to keep it light and ultrafast drying. Just like everything else we like here in the US we like to have tons of options! lolThese definitely provide that. I hope this helps you understand a little better. EDIT Im on mobile so I cant do much but I was able to find a picture of the fabric netting that creates the builtin underwear in board shorts As you can see its VERY light and wont trap and hold air or water but it still gives you support and protection by creating a layer against the skin and an outer layer to deal with sand and friction and your board when surfing or boogie boarding which both help recent chaffing and rash.  ,MilitaryGfys,deganx3,1,t5_32br2
