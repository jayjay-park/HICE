Now they are spinning gold out of titles they never would of imagined making movies of. I am not saying that Guardians of the Galaxy is a bad movie just that  years ago if you told someone that Marvel was going to be making the movie they would of asked what you were smoking. Just because the title was never as popular as FF XMen or SpiderMan. I am happy that Marvel is digging deep into their massive mythology to pull out some great stories.,hdtgm,cjp96jb,1,t5_2ujc0

10635203,0,t1_ddbquru,Overall you probably wouldnt be too confused but there are a handful of details that make it worth being familiar with the original movies that Ill lay out . This scene is referenced a few times and Vin Diesel wears this monstrosity a lot in the first movie. He also gets this cool carThe first movie is topspy Samuel L Jackson proposing what if we blackmailed a dirty renegade into becoming a dirty James Bond to beat dirty badguys? and then he recruits extreme athletestuntman Vin Diesel. After the recruitmentfield tests its just an American James Bond ripoff with gratuitous extreme sportsstunts...the whole triple X thing is meaningless beyond being a cool name the writers justified it with Diesel having a XXX tattoo on the back of his neckVin Diesel turned down the nd movie because he was picky about the script amp he didnt want to do sequels back then lololol so theres a throwaway line about his character getting killed on a mission in order for Sam Jackson to recruit renegade Navy SEAL Ice Cube as the new XXX in the XXX program The first two take themselves very seriously but the new one has a lot of funny self awareness,hdtgm,ddcxujv,3,t5_2ujc0

11622798,0,t3_65pwzy,some of this is copied from another sub sorry if youre reading it twiceI hope they get into the baby timelines when they do the episode. Because there is no way the baby timelines work out. Elena would have got pregnant at the beginning of  at the latest. Which is also when Mia had her baby. I felt like they were trying to retcon the moment in the beginning of  when Hobbes writes Elena the letter of recommendation like shes got to transfer because she is becoming a mom. BUT In the beginning of  Jack is shown to be a toddler being dropped of at preschool which would mean that there were at least two years between  and . But in  new Brian is clearly a baby under a year old. Jack either grew incredibly quickly or Elena was baking new Brian a reeaalllly long time.And then you have to look at Hobbes. He is the main person on the team who would have known about little Brian. He should be the first one to figure out why Dom is working for Cipher. Did he and his government agency just not have any clue that his friend and coworker disappeared along with her son? Hobbes may be sweaty but is he really this stupid?Fuck these movies Im fine with with turning the team into superheros. Im fine with ignoring the laws of physics. But you fuck with the baby timeline and Im out thats too unbelievable. s,hdtgm,dgdgedf,6,t5_2ujc0
11631507,0,t1_dg9qj5i,I didnt know about this sub till it showed up on Subredditdrama. I have my problems with June but calling her a sjw is ridiculous. Like what about the Tyler Perry movie podcast where she gets mad at the boyfriend for not fighting the people cat calling the love interest. June literally says Be a man! Shes not really funny in the way zukes or Paul is but shes pretty funny as the female audience surrogate. Like to hear what a womans perspective on a disturbing or bizarrely sexual scene is while the guys are just laughing at its absurdity or pushing the concept of the scene further into a joke. She also used to be hilarious in her misunderstanding of the plot but admittedly lots of her humor is as an audience surrogate in the weirdness of a movie like a child who has only seen a handful of films and cant process whats going on. I like her in episodes but if it was a choice between her or an industry insider Im going with the latter. Unless of course its a Vin Diesel movie because the dynamic of Paul and her discussing him is my favorite thing from the podcast hands down. ,hdtgm,dgefzl8,5,t5_2ujc0
