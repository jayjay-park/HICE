4629924,0,t3_3ed4hk,Will this card stack with itself? For example if your current hand was Lock and Load and Hunters MarkPlay Lock and LoadPlay Hunters Mark Adds a Lock and Load to HandPlay second Lock and Load Adds random spellPlay random spellWould the random spell add one or two cards to your hand?,TGTPRDT,cte68ae,3,t5_39936
4640718,0,t1_ctf0swd,well big sister. Much like Tazdingo this has the chance to live a turn though. And you cant even really halfway kill it because that will just buff it.,TGTPRDT,ctfj2jy,2,t5_39936
4662663,0,t1_cti8fqf,It is not an above curve AH set however. Its a different distribution. Blackwing Technician is a worse AH curve than standard but a better one if her Battlecry takes effect. Spider Tank as the most vanilla minion at the Mana Cost we have is the correct comparison.With that in mind  doesnt really warrant a drawback and the lack of a Tribal makes the card even worse in comparison. Consequently the best way for this card to see much of any play would be for it to work well with currently unrevealed cards in TGT. ,TGTPRDT,ctia93t,2,t5_39936
4663083,0,t1_ctenv23,Weak? Seriously? Man Control Warriors will be bonkers.  armor every turn  his others armors stuffs will easely make them immortal. ,TGTPRDT,ctic5ka,2,t5_39936
4685847,0,t3_3ed55l,This isnt bad in a token Shaman deck.  Two Hero Powers doubles the chance for a taunt totem which slows the overall tempo down which helps get to the point where the token whombocombos can be used.,TGTPRDT,ctl72np,2,t5_39936
4741712,0,t3_3fv5gj,We heard you like Salty Dogs so we printed a  mana Salty Dog that sometimes draws you  mana Salty Dogs.This card is useless.,TGTPRDT,cts8jvz,7,t5_39936
4742675,0,t3_3fv8mm,like just sunfury protectorargus gt Double Mark of the wild. Insane value.Ridiculous card in a tokeneggish warrior.Good potential to be the best card in this set.,TGTPRDT,ctscxi1,0,t5_39936
4776845,0,t1_ctw9otj,The Excess Mana card is a mechanic unique to Wild Growth a dev tweeted.,TGTPRDT,ctwnw4s,2,t5_39936
4814185,0,t3_3grswf,so basically this is a  mana dr boom. It will never ever see play in constructed.,TGTPRDT,cu1d982,-4,t5_39936
