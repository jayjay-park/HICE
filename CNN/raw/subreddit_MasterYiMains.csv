6747004,0,t3_483xn7,I think this would be okay against a heavy AP Team but rageblade is simply the better option imo. Look at the raw stats. Wits End and Rageblade cost the same but at  stacks Rageblade gives a total of  ATK Speed  AD  AP and guinsoos rage. Wits end gives MR MR shred and  Magic damage per hit. If you are going AP Yi Sated Boots Wits End Nashors HextechRageblade Defense Item or against a heavy AP team Wits End would be okay. In any other situation I dont see it working. ,MasterYiMains,d0h73fh,1,t5_39cx8

The passive of BOTRK Basic attacks deal  of the targets current health will aplly twice every phantom hitTrue damage will apply twiceRageblade wont gain more stacks with phantom hits. Itll always take  autoattack to get it fully chargedAnd lastly about the lifesteal. Yes technically you have lifesteal on the phantom second hit but the phantom second hit does  physical damage so youre not gaining any life from it because its a percentage of the damage which of course means when the damage is  you are going to get  life back.,MasterYiMains,d1k7o1k,1,t5_39cx8
