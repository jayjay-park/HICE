2633993,0,t3_2q2rck,Simple question Is cracked jumping on the social justice bandwagon for hits or does Cracked just really dislike men?I could provide evidence  but lets face it you guys only will take the softball questions underarmed from the fanboys,BestofCracked,cn2eain,-3,t5_34fa7

2932909,0,t1_cnwlt8o,Also hurting things is that a few decades ago there was a MASSIVE invasion of the FLDS that separated families and children in Arizona see here that has kind of scared the government off from a whole lot of direct action unless theres really concrete evidence that its needed. That raid made the larger public super sympathetic to the FLDS and largely backfired. Additionally then and probably still now the Arizona foster care system couldnt handle the massive influx of children.,BestofCracked,co1hf9c,1,t5_34fa7

3024430,0,t1_cob7mdk,I have very little training or experience in directing for film so we generally leave that to our two inhouse USCtrained directors Abe Epperson and Adam Ganser. That said I have occasionally had the chance to direct a sketch for the site and throughout my theater career I was primarily a director. I looooooove directing and working with actors and sometimes Abe lets me do that even on a project he is mostly directing. Im not so great at lighting and camera angles so I let Adam and Abe do their thing but if theres ever a Cracked play or I get back into the staged event world I would jump at the chance to direct a play again.Directing movies I wrote is all I wanna do more than anything. Abe and I wanna codirect movies that are blatantly picking up where the Coen brothers leave off. Thats all we wanna do. Well see if we get there.,BestofCracked,cobh9f0,3,t5_34fa7

3172296,0,t1_coqqbw9,I interviewed an army interrogator and the former head lawyer for the CIA. Those are GOING to turn into an article but they havent yet because its a tough subject to cover.I cant think of any great content that weve just shelved. But a lot of the time Ill talk to someone who has one really neat story that we cant really turn into a full article. Months will go by and then someone else will come to us with another story and well find a way to combine both. This article Took like a year to put together for just that reason.,BestofCracked,coqt2ep,4,t5_34fa7
3172957,0,t1_coqtis1,Youll notice those articles have links to statistical evidence studies etc wherever possible to provide broader perspective. We also try to interview multiple sources on many of those articles.The vetting process varies I went into detail in another answer here but basically it ranges from pay stubs and work IDs etc to DDs or even pictures of piles of drugs scales dealing paraphernalia etc. Im not going to say that every article we do on say a cop or an ER doctor is completely representative of everyone who does that job. But I do think were able to give readers a lot MORE perspective on how those jobs look for a chunk of the people who do them.,BestofCracked,coqvj9a,6,t5_34fa7

I havent updated the guidelines yet because I am a total goon but basically the deal is that the editors do a pass first moving everything they like to Considering and the moderators go through after and leave feedback on everything that we werent into. If they see something cool that we missed they let us know. ,BestofCracked,cpkiax1,2,t5_34fa7

It has made me incredibly happy and Id like to know if it was intentional. Thank you for doing this! ,BestofCracked,cqo8abq,2,t5_34fa7
