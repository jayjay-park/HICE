1495146,0,t1_cj2ibtl,No doubt. There are more players and theres far more at stake and to gain then national pride and flags. Not to mention its not only countries but companies as well. Though tension is rising around the globe Im not thoroughly convinced a space race will be the stress relief. I would absolutely love it too. Trying to economically collapse a nation may work if poised against China but not sure how a West vs. East stand off like before will need much more than geosynchronous orbit and perhaps moon. However on that note propulsion power and communication stand for great advancement in such a scenario.,tmro,cj3owg7,2,t5_3174g
1549540,0,t1_cjag6nl,With the raw computational power and instrumentational variety of modern electronics backed up by a regular replenishment of the fleet by one or two cubes in most Mars bound missions thereafter  to mitigate wastage due to those same electronic elements vulnerability to radiation I think an APS Areographical Positioning System right? could be doable in the first generation.I can see that feature being axed in the first round if the massenergyprocessingdollar budget doesnt allow for the optimum suite of capabilities... however its something that could probably be implemented in software at a later date.,tmro,cjaib5j,1,t5_3174g

1923221,0,t3_2gmyf3,Im sure that Elon would be too busy to do an interview.  As far as big names go there was Chang Diaz and he is fairly well known.  Perchance Robert Zubrin could be interviewed.  For ideas I suggest going through the large archive of podcasts at The Space Show.  As an alternative to Elon I suggest finding some random engineer or technitian who works for SpaceX getting their permission and the permission of the company itself deciding guidelines about what can and cannot be discussed on the show and doing an interview of that person or perhaps a few persons who work at SpaceX.  That would be good enough.MM,tmro,ckkxnk1,4,t5_3174g

4589153,0,t1_ct8x2u7,Honey bees mason bees and other pollinators will definitely be needed.gt HaberBosch might be necessary since Martian soil is not fertile. I highly doubt that Dutch White Clover grows on Mars without a littleor more likely quite a lot of help.  Dutch white clover is a leguminous plant i.e. one which fixes nitrogen. The HaberBosch process is simply an artificial version of that same process.You may need to bring or generate some bootstrap fertilizer to start but fixing nitrogen enmass would likely be cheaper with plants especially low plants like clover which intercept light that would otherwise unproductively strike bare soil.,tmro,ct925cd,2,t5_3174g

6030530,0,t3_3y1ros,Considering that Blue Origin has been up there with China for secretive development I assume we mere mortals especially those of us that dont move in rocketry development circles on a daily basis might not know if BO had an orbital launcher plan up their sleeves? SpaceX is far more open so we know theyre developing sexy space suits and large methane engines and eventually a colonial transport system.The other thing to bear in mind is whilst both SpaceX and BO have billionaires backing them in the case of BO that billionaire has a pretty steady income stream not in any way related to rocketry or launch services. If BO have a launch failure they might not have to worry so much about whether theyll lose customers for their vehicles or engines.,tmro,cya4cw2,1,t5_3174g

7410113,0,t3_4grqn3,The thing I dont understand about the StarChip plan is where is the power coming from at the far end of the journey? They need the power output of an aircraft radar system to be seen by the ground stations on Earth but theyre too small for batteries which wouldnt last long enough anyway or RTGs. If theyre planning on covering the sail with panels facing towards the nearest star theyll be dead from around Jupiter until they reach into the equivalent point in the star system at the far end. m gives you quite a bit of room for flexible solar PV but even with double the conversion efficiency we can currently manage isnt it going to struggle a bit?,tmro,d2khc63,1,t5_3174g

The new New Shepard vehicle should be fairly ready by now otherwise they would not retire the current one. VG has their system rolled out and SpaceX and Boeing are just wild guesses. After all SpaceX just had a Falcon experiencing and rapid unscheduled disassembly.,tmro,d7w4ica,1,t5_3174g
10583256,0,t1_dd7blyh,Pluto orbits at an inclination of  degrees above the ecliptic of the solar system so it actually never gets close to Neptunes orbit it just looks that way from topdown.Also mathematical ratios have been developed to determine what defines clearing out an orbit. Hilariously Alan Stern the lead for the New Horizons mission developed an algorithm to help define clearing out an orbit that ultimately cost Pluto its major planet status. One of those rare cases of Ive brought it on myself in science ,tmro,dd7kxo6,3,t5_3174g
