The matchmaking in its current form is incredibly harsh on people who queue up solo. Im curious to know the results of your MPa loadout with the blindfire mod. The goal is pretty much to never aim down your sights. Just pop out of corners spraying like a psycho or hide behind cover and let aim assist rip someone apart for you. I dont like this style of play at all. I prefer to aim manually and shoot people but I did try this bullshit loadout out for a few days and its just stupid easy to steam roll people with it with far less effort than it takes me to carry games using a Mazur LDR. ,unchartedmultiplayer,d3ocolz,1,t5_35mkp

Ever since the Lost Treasures update Ive been perpetually bouncing back and forth between Bronze III and II and absolutely cannot escape the cycle.As of today Ive been pushed back to  points on Bronze III after a long series of uninterrupted losses that always comes paired with the Top Performer bonus whose  points have become a sick joke to me at this point.Im on the verge of going all the way back to Apprentice and will have nothing to show for it.

8835574,0,t1_d79pdfk,Because you dont have to pay....Like everyone else is saying the DLC guns are nothing special. As someone who has also been with the multiplayer for this series longer than most U Closed Beta I have to say that there is so much that ND got right such as the feel. I dislike mysticals and sidekicks I really do but they arent that impactful at higher level play. In fact I think they are a necessary evil to flush campers looking at you Island and Rooftops. What it sounds like you were expecting or hoping for was one of the previous installments. And I was right there with you for a long time. Honestly Uncharted  multi is the best competitive game Ive ever played.

10166284,0,t3_5liocq,I also think a reason why it didnt make a huge hit as a competitive game is because MPs in Uncharteds are very inconsistent and that divides the player population. Many people I knew that loved s multiplayer had a hard time getting used to s and those who did loved it including myself still find s very different and kind of meh? Also that theyd bring in CS shiz with chests and ranked modes with no support to back it up properly and a player pool to keep it going as it should be is super half assed and people just move on. Last but not least MW remaster PLUS BF PLUS Overwatch may or may not be the huge strike on why Uncharted couldnt get a proper competitive scene for itself. ,unchartedmultiplayer,dbwekdd,1,t5_35mkp
