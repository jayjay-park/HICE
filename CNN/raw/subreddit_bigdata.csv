426627,0,t3_1x0t6e,Im on a phone so I cant provide much detail. Look at elasticsearch with kibana. See elasticsearch site for demo. I setup a  node cluster imported millions of records and was getting statistical results within a work day. Ive been using it for call data records. We get about s of gigs of data and s of millions of records a day. Getting aggregate results across a weekly range takes seconds which probably depends on your servers. I have  servers in the cluster using  cores and  gigs of ram and  server with  cores and  gigs of ram. These servers have heavy io going on for other processes. Extremely easy to get a cluster going. More time needed to wrap your head around json lucene query formats. Plenty of performance info out there and very responsive community.,bigdata,cfozh42,2,t5_2s9be

2740276,0,t3_2rfkro,I work with Learning Management Systems and lots of student data and historically we only report on Butts in Seats which is just completion data.  It only proves that person was there not if they learned anything nor if that learning was useful or not.   It would be a great day to be able to offer something more insightful by pulling in other data sources like quiz scores click stream data server access logs and perhaps crm dataperformance data.  Can you recommend a way to get started and better define these questions that can translate into a data problems? Not sure if that makes any sense.  Let me ask another way Is there any guides for standard problems within an industry and normal data solutions for these problems so for example for education here are the top  data insights you will need X number of data sources to solve these.  thanks!,bigdata,cnfk3bq,1,t5_2s9be
3060436,0,t3_2v6thu,Access to reams of public data and being able to martial it in pursuit of advancing capitalistic agendas is the new front of the power hungry. I think we as consumers and individuals deserve the right to control our data and it is we who should control our own data self and who has access to it. Shouldnt we own the data we create the data that others use to manipulate us into giving away our money?,bigdata,cof7m5m,0,t5_2s9be
3517839,0,t3_3005x4,I have a different thought on the roles of the data scientist. Consider the data scientist Venn diagram where they are considered a unicorn. I have been in the game for a few decades and used to be a webmaster. Nowadays you would never have one person fill the role of graphics UI server side code and database in a single role. I personally think data scientist will refine into multiple roles someday too. Any feedback?,bigdata,cpt9d5r,1,t5_2s9be

5002200,0,t1_cuom36d,I would say start with free classes online  dont bother blowing a few dollars on a course until youve proven to yourself that youll actually go through the course.  But I guess thats just a personal philosophy.  The best places to look for online courses in my opinion are Coursera EdX Udacity and Khan Academy  I started with an intro to data science course on Udacity in January and I work as a data analyst now.  Its a course in python using the pandas library.  Once you get a hang of manipulating data in pandas check out rdatasets for some data sets to play with.  I am fairly wellversed in python but not so much in R.R and Python are the two most popular languages among data scientists.  R is a standalone program with a ton of statistical addons and it is very powerful.  Python is a high level programming language that can be described as the duct tape that holds the rest of your programs together.  Pythons anaconda distribution comes with most things you need.If you want to get into machine learning kaggle is an awesome place.  They host machine learning competitions.  Companies post data you download it and train your machine to learn using algorithms in scikit learn or using R.  Then you upload your predictions and the website scores you.  Winners get paid.You can learn plenty of the basics of hadoop hive spark mapreduce etc. just by reading.   You can also install spark locally on windows or like any other desktop OS of course and run a standalone spark cluster  and its even pretty easy to do.  Another great way to learn is to install virtualbox and the cloudera hadoop virtualbox image  It requires close to GB RAM to run smoothly but is a good learning tool.  In case you dont know what that is virtualbox allows you to run linux inside of a windows machine.  The cloudera image is a linux distribution with hadoop and other things already set up for you.I would personally define Big Data as enough data that you cannot load it all into RAM and manipulate it.  So you have to restructure your program to work around RAM limitations then your data set is at least annoyingly big.  Others would define big data as ridiculously large data  on the order of terabytes of data gathered per day think google facebook youtube flickr snapchat. ,bigdata,cuoybdx,4,t5_2s9be

If there is a change in data requirements you can reprocess the raw data set with the additional columns.ampnbspIf your business needs change you need data to be transformed near realtime then you could use a stream processing engine like Spark or Flink but the data storage options would be similar.,bigdata,df7xcl1,2,t5_2s9be
