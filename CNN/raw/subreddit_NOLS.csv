6108860,0,t1_cyk031k,I have a handful of things already like an internal frame pack a nanopuff jacket a fleece jacket a buff a thermos...And I have a sleeping bag but its downfilled and according to my gear list We stock syntheticfilled sleeping bags with a temperature rating of  degrees F or colder. Due to Alaskas extremely wet environment down and feather bags are not recommended. So Im thinking Ill rent that from them just  to rent.I guess I was just wondering if anyone had good hindsight where they realized later that maybe they should have bought something instead of renting or vice versa.Also in terms of a budget my course has an  equipment deposit which goes towards renting gear from NOLS but when I did the math my equipment cost looks like itll be between  low end of the range being the cost of renting everything I can and the high end being the cost of buying everything.,NOLS,cyk0jp3,1,t5_2tcau
