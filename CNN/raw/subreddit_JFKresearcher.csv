9459975,0,t3_5a2uhz,unighthawk thanks and that makes me feel better from my own reddit downvote adventures!although few they are frustrating to a new userMakes sense. The whole give a man a mask.... etc etc you get the truth.Unfortunately a difference of opinion doesnt always mean discussion or lead to answers IMO. Some like to attack regardless.And we all sometimes fall into the trap of answering emotionally rather than intelligently.However at least there is a response in those cases.uJohnsonjay I personally wouldnt worry about the downvotes. You have enemies? Good. That means youve stood up for something sometime in your life.Winston Churchill,JFKresearcher,d9f4ans,2,t5_2y7ki
