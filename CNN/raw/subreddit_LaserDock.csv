Since you are in the US we cant recommend any noncompliant laser projectors so youre looking at either Lightspace USA or Kvant. Please note that you as a customer still need an approved FDA variance before buying any laser projector. Some companies will help you with this but itll cost around .,LaserDock,d7r42il,1,t5_3fadv
11547155,0,t3_609sn2,I would still love to see a lissajous pattern option in the Visualizer.  Since you are already showing waveforms it shouldnt be that challenging.You make the left stereo channel deflect the Xaxis and the right stereo channel deflect the Yaxis.  This means every song played has its own unique set of patterns.  The colors can be random.Thanks,LaserDock,dg4vf3g,1,t5_3fadv
