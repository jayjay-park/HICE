1036596,0,t1_chlz7kd,I had a vmax cc rocket of a cruiser an old seca bobber a  Vf interceptor a Honda rebel and some scooters. I think I just like sport bikes most and know the market. Im not against other kinds of bikes but I dont know the value as much so Id be afraid of losing money and Id rather not do that.,Sportbikes,chm46ri,1,t5_2qya3
4357167,0,t1_csgqqnp,Theres definitely something to this.  I can live with the fact that if I screw up and injury myself permanently then I have to live with those choices.  Theres no getting around the fact that riding is dangerous and that weighs heavily on my mind when Im out with my wife.  If I were to get into an accident and she was to be hurt it would be something that would haunt me to my grave.  ,Sportbikes,csgsaxi,2,t5_2qya3

In some states like mineTN if you take the Basic Riders Course it satisfies the riding portion of your test so all that is left is a written test. Which honestly if you pass the BRC or have common sense and good test taking skills youll get your license. For your height and weight I would personally recommend you look in the cc range. Something like an R  CBR  etc. .however there are many types of bikes and with different types comes different styles. I ride a  Ninja because its a Sport Touring bike. One reason I love my bike is because the riding position is very comfortable easy to go on long rides. Good luck with obtaining your endorsement and prepare to get addicted.,Sportbikes,ct0ateo,2,t5_2qya3
11527558,0,t3_64fbus,Have you considered bikes that are pseudo sporty like the Kawi  or Suzuki SVGladius? Theyre going to be fast enough to keep your interest and not boring enough to outgrow quickly. True sportbikes are all crazy fast unless you get down to the cc bracket at which point you risk getting bored.,Sportbikes,dg2nfi6,2,t5_2qya3
