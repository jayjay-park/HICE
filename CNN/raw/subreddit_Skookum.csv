If I built this thing to be shot into space it would cost under a hundred dollars. If you amortize out certification over units sold and even factor in multiple regional certs and engineering cost I cant imagine it evens out as even  This also beggars belief because there is no requirement for this.

10934759,0,t3_5w35zi,He brings up gold leaf which is around  nm thick.  Not only is gold leaf gonna be incredibly flexible and bend to cover any surface it touches the surface finish is gonna be waaaaaaay better than the  nm wringing requires.  Theyre probably near atomically smooth . nm roughness.  That makes it very different from the indium or gold chips.The gold and inium are never gonna weld unless they are atomically flat.  When they contact there are tiny peaks that may cold weld but the strength of the weld is gonna be about the same as the compressive force used For a spot to bond you have to crush down the peaks until they squish out into a pancake.  The force will be the same as the compressive strength of the material at that area because its in yield and in metals the tensile strength will be pretty much the same as compressive.  If you smash them together the bounce back force will be about the same as the hitting force so the bond will just immediately break.When you twist them it allows you to deform the metal through galling until it forms a mechanical and welded bond.  There is no bounce so the bond doesnt immediately break.  Its also much easier to form because the peaks are sheared off when a peak shears the bond area is double the shear area plus it allows other peaks to also come into contact plus shear strength is generally weaker than tensile strength.  A light twist would result in a bond with much more strength than what was put into the twist.Neither is related to gauge blocks but still!  very cool.,Skookum,de7udnd,1,t5_38rze

11268100,0,t1_df97ki1,A google search for Nikon D mirror lockup suggests that you can only lock the mirror up for cleaning not for taking photos so that option is out.Your camera does appear to have an accessory port on the left hand side that will allow you to trigger the shutter. Google nikon accessory port pinout for more info. gt I need to capture muzzle velocity the goal is to ramp up to ultimate top speedDo you actually need to capture muzzle velocity or would it suffice to capture velocity at a fixed distance from the muzzle so you can compare each run and fine tune your conditions for top speed? Even if you do need muzzle velocity you could instead capture two velocities at known distance from the muzzle derive the ballistic coefficient and use it to calculate the muzzle velocity. If your projectile is supersonic you might need to make all measurements prior to going subsonic. I dont know how that transition affects the calculation but I doubt its smooth.If your goal is just to measure projectile speeds then a pair of interrupted beam sensors at a fixed separation would be much easier. There are tons of bullet chronographs on the market that use two such sensors spaced  apart. It occurs to me that were starting to get away from high speed camera work and into weapon design so Ill avoid any further suggestions per rule  unless someone else says projectile speed measurement is OK.,Skookum,df980m6,1,t5_38rze
