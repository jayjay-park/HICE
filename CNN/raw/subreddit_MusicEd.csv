1288512,0,t3_28k7re,WARNING Long detailed post. Prepare yourself.To quickly address your concerns Quality of ProgramRutgers Montclair and Temple were all schools I considered attending for music ed. I am looking to be a choir director as well. All three are well known at least in the tristate area for their music programs and I only hear good things regarding job placement quality of the programs faculty etc. However I am not well educated on Rowan BUT I know a lot of people in the education programs at TCNJ which is topnotch. Both Montclair and TCNJ are highly respected and wellknown for their education programs which youre aware of. Regarding music programs I would not necessarily recommend TCNJ if you are looking for a school strong in performance but Rutgers Montclair and Temple seem to offer this. Will elaborate later on. CostAs an NJ resident Montclair would most likely be the cheapest option. I am also from New Jersey but received more from Temple than from Rutgersnot sure what was up with that. Ultimately Temple and Rutgers were about the same price for me and Montclair was much less. It also depends on whether you plan to commute or dorm at any of the NJ schools and whether you are getting scholarship money federal aidloans or both.  Transfer convenienceI have no firsthand experience with this unfortunately. My best advice is that you should if you havent already get in contact with the admissions offices at each school and ask them what your situation would be. I have a feeling that transitioning from a music majorcertificate program to a strictly music ed. program will most likely require you to start over as a freshman though perhaps staying in the same state might avoid that problem. I know transfers at my school generally have to do a lot of stuff over again specifically due to theory class credits not transferring. Everyone wants you to learn theory THEIR way yada yada. Also requirements for observation hours may differ now especially if you are going into a strictly music ed. degree. This may set you back as well.Westminster Choir College would be ideal for you but I know you are looking at public universities specifically. I have friends at WCC so I am aware of how tough it is to get decent financial aid...I dont know what your primary instrument is though your username suggests you are a vocalist but it was also important for me to study the faculty for my primary instrument at each school. That was a huge deciding factor. Unfortunately I can only tell you about piano faculty but fortunately I can tell you that Temple Rutgers and Montclair all have awesome piano professors. Im sorry if this is not relevant to you.Since you are interested in choral music ed. I would also suggest strictly analyzing the choral programs at each of these schools maybe find some recordings if you can. You want to make sure you will be learning great things from your ensemble experiences and performances in addition to your classes and not just be putting up with rehearsal so to speak. Not saying any of these schools has a bad choral program but maybe try to find the one whose director best fits your choral philosophy. I didnt do this enough and now I am suffering a bit as I dont totally agree with the approach many of the directorsconductors take at my school. It is perhaps most important for you to learn and observe what works and what doesnt work when it comes to directing a choir. Whether it be positively or negatively you will be highly influenced by your directors so seriously consider this aspect of the deal. A class on choral conducting is not quite the same as experiencing the amazing sound generated by someone who knows how to properly work with voices.Also consider the size of each program. Rutgers and Temple are absolutely huge compared to the other schools you listed. My guess is that their music programs are therefore largest Rutgers specifically due to the fact that it is the most wellknown school in Jersey. I know Montclairs music program is still developing. My former piano teacher informed me that Montclair only recently has been recognized for music. Always been famous for education however. If you like the huge university feel go for it. But if you are looking for more individualized attention I would suggest a smaller program like Montclair or TCNJ. Make sure you are happy with the location of each school too. Temples campus is a bit strange because it is in the middle of Philly so it wouldnt be your typical college experience.Regarding performance Rutgers Mason Gross School and Temples Boyer College have the strongest programs. Rutgers is specifically known for musical theater. To quote a friend who just graduated from there Mason Gross is big on being performancelevel on your instrument and performing as much as possible. Not sure what Temple specializes in but their symphony orchestra was nominated thrice for a Grammy so they clearly have something good going on. It also helps that Temple is located in a city where performancecultural opportunities are more likely to be available. Montclair doesnt fail to impress with its performance program but like I said it is lesserknown. From what I observed it seems that their choir recently performed with the NJ Symphony Orchestra. So Im sure they have some fine opportunities as well. TCNJs program is good but Im not sure I would call it very good. Two of my best friends from high school currently attend TCNJ and participate in the college ensembles. One is involved in band and the other choir. They both have expressed a lack of satisfaction with the quality of these ensembles. They did not necessarily say that the ensembles were bad but did express their wishes for a more demanding and higherlevel setting. Neither friend is a music major.Once again I dont know too much about Rowan but it looks like that has already been covered by someone else.As for education programs Montclair TCNJ and Rowan are most notable in this respect as you know by this point. Of course Montclair has the history of being THE teacher college. But ALL of the schools you listed are wellregarded for education. So ultimately your final decision falls upon how important performance is to you and therefore what performance program suits your goals.I believe for your interests you should rule out schools by the order in which you listed your concerns. That would be  Quality Cost Transfer convenience.It may help to create a brief but specific chart comparing your school choices sidebyside. I made an Excel spreadsheet during my decision days. You can see all your options at once and keep necessary information in the same place. It made the process a bit less overwhelming for me.Yeah it sucks to start over. If someone told me that I had to repeat high school I would run away screaming change my name and move to a remote island. But would you rather finish sooner in a program you werent too happy with or spend . extra years finetuning your skills at a place you really love? I cannot rank these schools for you or tell you which is best as colleges are not a onesizefitsall deal but I hope I have given you some more insight that will help you narrow down your decision. Anyway my rant ends here but congratulations to you if you made it this far.I hope your decision process goes smoothly and that you end up in the program that will make you happiest. Definitely take a lot of tours if you can and try to meet current or graduated students. Good luck.,MusicEd,ciekokr,2,t5_2swl6

Music Ed is hard.  Not just the course work but once you are out in the real world it gets harder.  If you find a job you will be the lowest of the low as far as respect until you manage to prove yourself amongst the rest of the faculty.  After that you will still need to constantly defend your program and your job.  You will have the highest number of students seen per week than any other teacher in your district and you will need to make sure each and every one of them is competent.  In short if you have any doubts or think teaching Music is just a good idea dont bother.  If on the other hand you are REALLY passionate about it good luck!,MusicEd,cofnads,1,t5_2swl6

5930763,0,t1_cxx02ko,In short yeah its to make reading easier. But this is because...A lot of instruments are essentially the same within their families but just larger or smaller to extend the ranges. Take for example the alto saxophone in Eb and the tenor saxophone in Bb. The keys on a tenor saxophone are exactly the same as an alto saxophone but they produce different notes. If the alto saxophone was in C you would have to use the fingering that is the fingering for what is an A on an alto to play a concert C. If tenor was also in C you would have to use the D fingering to play a concert C. This means that you have to learn two sets of fingerings for each saxophone even though the keywork is exactly the same. With transposition when altos and tenors see the note C written on their music they use the C fingering which is the same on both instruments but produces an Eb on alto and a Bb on tenor. So basically Adolphe Sax chose have all the saxophones have the same fingering correspond to the same written notes but they produce different pitches depending on the instrument. The reason why Eb and Bb were chosen is because for example on the alto the concert Eb major scale is the easiest to play being straight up and down the tone holes not using any odd fingerings. This is the same for Concert Bb major for tenor. Some instruments have the most common member of their family as a transposing instrument such as the clarinet family. The soprano clarinet in Bb the most common is a transposing instrument because the C clarinet used to be the most popular but is now out of fashion. It would be good if the soprano clarinet could be changed to a C instrument but all its existing repertoire would have to be transposed so it remains a Bb instrument.  ,MusicEd,cxx1yj1,3,t5_2swl6

6197469,0,t3_40h37r,When I did my student teaching a couple of years back my mentor had me lay low a bit to get a feel for everyone. Took a few weeks for the students to give me a chance MS amp HS. It worked great for me in a learning experience as he told me the th grade classes were all mine. He told me what he wanted accomplished and I ran with it. I would give this student a chance to lead in some areas. Start off by having them in the front following your lead giving them instruction and advice between classes and telling them what you expect to accomplish at the end of each lesson. Then eventually let them take over a grade or two to really start teaching. That helped me immensely! Eventually I was running every class and being the band director he was I would see him in the morning with HS band and then eventually at the end of the day. Not exactly ethical but he gave me freedom to learn and to teach comfortably. Hope this helps! If you need more ideas PM me. Prep is over! ,MusicEd,cyu33x5,1,t5_2swl6

They know if they get one wrong they have to restart in order to get  so it really pushes them to practice and focus.Also there is a great game called Staff Wars which rewards speed and accuracy in the form of a fun Star Wars themed game. You can download it for free directly from the developer website or pay . for it in the app store.I think maybe your students would also benefit from some sight reading activities.  Start with one note simple rhythms.  Branch out to  or  notes simple rhythms. Maybe then keep the same  or  notes but change up the rhythms.  Continue gradually branching out.  I know sight reading takes time but it is time well spent and scaffolding better rehearsals for the future.  I dont think one single thing could change rehearsals more than a little bit of sight reading practice.  At all levels elementary through adult.,MusicEd,d0xvxoq,1,t5_2swl6

It costs about  USD at least when I purchased it. While it does not really do wave form analysis it does variable speed the best out of any software on the market in my opinion you just take an audio file and put it into the program and can change the playback speed and there is absolutely no change in sound quality as on other software. As far as waveform analysis something I personally use is Tonal Energy. While I havent found a way to use other recordings it is really useful to watch the analysis functions while playing.,MusicEd,dclldlh,2,t5_2swl6

As a percussionist I sometimes have to teach some very difficult rhythmic patterns. It helps to show students that theyve already learned how to play the complex th note passages just in eighth notes at slower tempi. Its all about the proportions of note durations. Then get a metronome and start practicing those patterns. Youll get better at it. ,MusicEd,dcmpg3c,2,t5_2swl6
