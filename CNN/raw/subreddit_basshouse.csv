5746143,0,t1_cx63ic0,When I first created the subreddit the sort of music I intended it for was basically exactly the stuff ubarbadosslim mentioned. If you check the first submission on the subreddit by me this is exactly what bass house was when the genre was first emerging alongside future house deep house and the other spinoffs specifically Shadow Child and the Food Music label. Although this sort of house may not seem that similar to the Jauz and Ephwurd style that is being uploaded recently I do consider it just an evolution of the genre and would personally still group the two. The stylistic elements of the song are very consistent despite having slightly different sounds ,basshouse,cx9d5kl,3,t5_2wkea
