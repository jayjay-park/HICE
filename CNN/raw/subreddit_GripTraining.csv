1821690,0,t1_ck864ox,So weve heard that IronMind rates grippers by testing the poundage required to close it from the center of the handles. Other companies might use the very ends of the grippers and achieve a lower number. For example while IronMind states that their  gripper is equal to lbs Cannon Powerworks rates them at an average of lbs. I say average because Captains of Crush grippers while being an incredibly sturdy and useful product vary a lot in poundage between grippers. Here is a chart of many types of grippers with several of the same levels of grippers rating between wide ranges each. Its at the point to where if you want to get an actual accurate idea of where your gripper really is poundagewise you should get it rated.That all being said it is difficult to say what gripper strength directly translates to. They will make your closing fingers strong youll be able to hold more weights when you lift but without thumbcentric extensor wrist forearm et cetera type exercises you wont be able to achieve that wellrounded crushing hand strength that your body is capable of. And if youd like to see how much weight you can hold in one hand Id say onearmed deadlifts are the way to go.

Its all about the level of challenge and whether or not the movement in question is in line with your goals.Do you fail at this movement after sec or less of intense effort?

As long as youre making progress youre still getting stronger regardless of plate texture. You can always test out your iron plate pinch at some other point so this isnt a huge deal.But for now its cool to just use whatever handle is thin enough to grip properly.

9070752,0,t1_d81vn8r,gt everyone loves ANWThis is not the case in the parkour community. A lot of gyms will grudgingly offer ANW classes to survive but in general the parkour community does not care for ANW. One of the more poignant criticisms are that ANW is a reality show not an athletic competition. The people who are selected are not selected because they are the best at ANW they are selected because it will provide the best drama. But the people who run ANW mislead fans by acting as if its a competition for the best of the best. People train hard they build the skills and then they dont get selected. Thats also why the show has to do a lot of fake stuff like when they got one of the Tapp brothers to pretend to streak. Another problem is that ANW completely ignores and disrespects parkour. They almost never mention parkour on the show and they invent their own terminology to avoid using parkour terms. In their application rules they discourage people from mentioning parkour and dont select parkour athletes. Basically shitting on people who have the best skills for their show. Also most people say the original show is way better but Ive only seen clips. ,GripTraining,d825omf,1,t5_2xxk8

10639775,0,t1_dd7yocg,With the real handles its less about letting them rotate horizontally. Thats a minor benefit. Whats really good about them is that the weight is hanging below your hand so they dont roll your hand open as much. That allows you to load up the rest of your body more and get the same grip workout. Ideally youll do them with a fairly high deadlift weight maybe even higher when youre an advanced trainee. Few other exercises load diagonally across the body that heavily Yoke and such are often less convenient. This has incredible benefits for your core lumbar and such. This is great for transferring force from the legs to the upper body for sports and just for life in general. If youre doing DB walks youre only exercising your hand as its too light of a weight to really impact your core and traps. I mean those muscles are strong enough for your heavy deadlifts and squats so  lb DBs arent really going to help them very much unless you walk a mile and get them some cardio. If you only have access to dumbbells its not the end of the world however. DB rows give you the same grip workout as a dumbbell walk but they do a lot more for the rest of the body. Or if you have some decently heavy DBs you can do unilateral walks for the core. A lb dumbbell in one hand really burns the obliques on the opposite side. Check out Phis link for visual aids about the mechanics.,GripTraining,dddeted,1,t5_2xxk8

10888233,0,t1_de2zf6a,Up to you. Not ideal but it wouldnt be bad or anything. Theyre two different lifts that emphasize different thumb muscles. It will make you stronger but the carryover isnt .  hand pinch is also a bit better for barbelldumbbell lifts as the thumb angle is similar sorta diagonal. Hits the thumb abductors more. The thumb is held flat to the implement in the hand pinch which puts more emphasis on opposition and flexion. You may be better off MacGyvering more weight onto your  hand pinch with a chain and a backpack or something. Can just put a chain and carabiner through the holes in the plates make the plates themselves into a pinch block. Or make a super simple block like this one.,GripTraining,de31l1i,2,t5_2xxk8

11330963,0,t1_dfgb6yg,Ask as many questions as you like! Worstcase scenario is that some of them are in the FAQ. But these arent. And just to clarify theyre not talking about reverse curls which are for the upper arm but reverse wrist curls which work the wrist extensors.. Wrist curls and reverse wrist curls do benefit strength but its better for beginners to use bodybuilding rep ranges. Builds muscle mass and more importantly connective tissue strength without stressing the joint too much. Arm wrestlers use a lot of wrist curl variations with very high weights so you can look into that when you get more advanced if you like.. Grip and wrist strength plays a HUGE part in your ability to transfer the strength of your other muscles into whatever youre touching. So yes! Your body wont even fully activate the rest of your muscles if your hands arent strong enough to accept the force from them so weak hands make you feel weak! Biceps curls use weights that are very light for the fingers but heavy on the wrists. Theyre also done at angles that are harder on the wrists than fingers. So wrist strength would be a bigger deal than grip strength for those. For stuff like deadlifts the wrist muscles just hold the wrist joint together they dont do much for the lift itself. The strength of the fingers and thumbs are huge though so the finger curls and pinch lifts from the beginner routine are great for beginner gripsters. Its also important for lifters to do barbellspecific grip stuff like deadlift top holds with a doubleoverhand grip a few sets of difficult sec holds on deadlift days is great. Calisthenics nuts can do similar things with dead hangs slowly working their way up to weighted armed dead hangs. After you build up some connective tissues with that you can add in more.  For reallife tasks like various forms of manual labor you often use all of your grip and wrist strength at once. Sometimes you use your hands even more than the rest of your muscles as with loosening or tightening difficult screws nuts and bolts.,GripTraining,dfgcgen,2,t5_2xxk8
