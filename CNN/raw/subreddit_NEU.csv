I have friends that graduated from each. Make your decision on how you feel while you spend time on each campus. Its college even BYU has parties. But you have to spend significant amounts of times on campus for  years so use your comfortability as a guide. ,NEU,deodmnj,22,t5_2r47x

You can always walk into UHCS and tell them you need to talk with counseling services and you will see someone within  minutes. If they decide you should see someone more than once a month very common within a week theyll email you a list of offsite therapists that take your insurance and are accepting new clients. From there its up to you to call and set it up on your own the part I cant make myself do,NEU,df5l8fe,2,t5_2r47x

11359979,0,t3_623s0u,People talk up the party scene way too much. At northeastern the party scene is extremely weak. There are lots of kids that drinksmoke with friends but if you want a frat party type situation youll need to go to a nearby school usually MITHarvard. If youre male no chance youll get into those parties unless youre with a group of girls or know someone. So if youre looking for a big time party school with lots of frats its not northeastern.So many clubs here depends what youre looking for. All are pretty social and welcoming First time caught with alcohol is essentially nothing but dont make a habit of it. Although its extremely hard to get caught Very strict with fake IDs around here justiceforqualitymart but the further off campus you get the more likely you are to find places that dont caredont have box scanners ,NEU,dfjmshc,19,t5_2r47x

11521344,0,t3_64g88k,Its hard to say since most LLCs change buildings year to year and because the older res halls are wildy inconsistent from room to room. There are a few freshman dorms that are suites but most other are res halls. The newer ones like Stetson are consistent room to room. The older ones like white hall vary by insane amounts. Ive seen doubles that should barely even be singles and doubles that could easily be triples so its somewhat of a surprise even if you know the buildings the LLCs are in Edit by res halls I mean stereotypical college dorms.

A decent number of CCIS majors take it as well. I find it dubious that your adviser told you to take the class yet couldnt tell you what the class was about. I cant really comment on how useful itll be to you without knowing what youre studying though.,NEU,dgqyobg,2,t5_2r47x
