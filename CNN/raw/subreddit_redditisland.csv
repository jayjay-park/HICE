646132,0,t1_cgdn41a,No thank you I would like to see a project like this come to fruition and dividing the effort is not the answer. Additionally a project like this requires lots of people a large number of people associate the project with this sub and rightly so many of the individuals here have the right talent sets to see this through. I just wish I knew what the hold up was.,redditisland,cgdpriv,1,t5_2rnuq

1347401,0,t1_cil2px4,Is it dangerous anywhere in America with the drugs and stuff?  The cartel violence is gruesome but similar things happen everywhere.  Most of the unrest is currently closer to Texas. Itd be like hearing about the south side Chicago gang murders and being scared of going to Philadelphia.Thats not to say there isnt a risk of traffickers coming around the general area but as nonparticipants in uncontested  unpopulated  undeveloped land we wont get our heads chopped off.  ,redditisland,cil75lg,7,t5_2rnuq

4534784,0,t3_3auij4,The problem with this idea is that too many people have too many different ideas as to how this would all work.  In theory it is a good idea in practice I feel it is a huge failure much like communism.  My idea is slightly different.  Although the idea is set in stone minor things can change due to what the viewers want and even though there is no direct benefit to what a donator would get the outcome remains the same and will be available to the entire world.,redditisland,ct28q5c,1,t5_2rnuq
