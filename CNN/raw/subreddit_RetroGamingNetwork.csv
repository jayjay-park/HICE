3082378,0,t1_coh9xf8, The nintendo removal is done  I left the dead code in the CSS in case this changes in the future I fixed the multireddit link I can make the wiki CSS page however I need to know that the code you have in the wiki is the final form. I have noticed that some details are different from what I started with on rretrogamingnetworkwhen I moved the sidebar CSS in. for example you have cut the first  lines of code from this sub when you pasted it in the wiki was that intented ?   It seems like a small issue but if were gonna roll out a code for others to copy itll reduce future workload to have a model thats straightforward and works immediately with minimal debug I made the redditname  down from  it was way too big IMOWere getting closer !!,RetroGamingNetwork,cohhj04,2,t5_330u2
