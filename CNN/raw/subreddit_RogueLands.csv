5744937,0,t3_3tqvqr,I brainstormed with a buddy a little bit. Here are the results. The names are not creative but the ideas would be cool. Barrier Creates a small shield that blocks enemy mobs and repels them backwards a small amount.. Pacify  Enemies very close to player are stunned for a brief amount of time.. Weak Point Analyzes high tier mobs for weaknesses prompting the player to attack at a specific weak spot for crit damage. . Eclipse Defensive combat chip that reduce fire damage such as lava or fireball either for a short period of damage or on a base level.. Chaos Mobs attack each other and become enraged doing more damage they might kill eachother but they move faster and more randomly potentially killing the player. Aetherwalk Teleport short distances uses mana and on a moderate cooldown..Greed Monsters killed within  seconds of activation give more lootcredits. High cooldown.,RogueLands,cx97rru,1,t5_32s0e

5874915,0,t3_3vox6v,gt Would something like this only be of use to a Chemist FaithMagic that uses Magicscaling combat chips?First FaithMagic users are Awakened. Second all staves have magic on them and only the Astra has faith. Honestly it makes sense. Faith isnt an offensive stat its about protection and survival. Staves are the easiest to use weapons as they dont require precise aiming or being in melee range. So it makes sense that theyd be a bit more limited in offensive power.As for Thornwalls use I cant think of anything it can do better than the Aetherstaff or Astra. Aetherstaff sacrifices  Magic for Tech which means a higher overall stat boost at higher rarities and allows for use of the delicious Plasma Grenade chip. Astra is the only staff to have Faith on it so that would be the weapon of choice for dedicated battlemages. Everything else is just kinda meh.,RogueLands,cxpqeb4,3,t5_32s0e

7730145,0,t3_4kau7e,That was one of the core things I liked in Magicite switching between a sword and a bow midfight feels really cool If this was implemented I might consider using melee weapons in Roguelands.,RogueLands,d3kv2a8,2,t5_32s0e
7975891,0,t1_d49y1vr,Agreed entirely. Especially with the vitality change it makes grinding new characters out REALLY tedious because you cant just rush to higher areas with your toptier gear and grind out levels really fast since you run the risk of getting shot by stuff which is now a thing all the way up until level s. Therere a LOT of things that need fixing and I really hope he doesnt ditch this game for Magicite which is just a way weaker game overall. I wouldnt call this a full game release. I think it still needs work and DIRECT community feedback. ,RogueLands,d4ckds9,1,t5_32s0e
7976295,0,t1_d4clibz,Nice work. Baby Sliver is really really good as long as you monitor your level progress Also I recommend checking out the Dragoon lance or Flameberge based on your stats. I main gauntlets and I am using Wrath Aura atm because that thing is ridiculous. ,RogueLands,d4cm0kl,1,t5_32s0e

8584743,0,t3_4x9y2u,Well getting all the ultimate weapons is just a matter of time.  runs through any Challenge  Map easiest is the Forbidden Arena as it will always just give you portals for itself.And with Forgeblade its not even that hard to get them legendary. If this is how you unlock the coming races then I will start right away ,RogueLands,d6eohie,1,t5_32s0e

10737827,0,t1_ddn6ib4,Supposedly the dupe glitch was going to be patched in the update but it wasnt. Using the dupe glitch you can duplicate money into scrap metal and then sell it thus getting two times the money. And then you can duplicate anything as much as youd like.,RogueLands,ddnixuc,1,t5_32s0e
