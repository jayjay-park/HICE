8026788,0,t1_d4gnpzi,I think most of it is that subconsciously we feel like its been done before and we gravitate to whatever bands we originally listened to that sounded like that. Its not until a band really brings some new element to the table that we get interested again. Just my thoughts on it. ,BringMeTheHorizon,d4iabdy,3,t5_2xz4h

10543449,0,t3_5qw6m3,As hard as it is to play this song on guitar lol this slowly becoming my favorite song in the album and Ive had this album since I was a sophomore in high school! I really wonder why this song was written and wtf the song title references however as much as I do like this song I still think it is outmatched by Pray for plagues Braille and medusa. So apples and oranges pretty much,BringMeTheHorizon,dd37ud9,5,t5_2xz4h
