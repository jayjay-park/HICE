7160081,0,t1_d1rx2tr,Well I meant more from a culture aspect then a financial or other things. Theres no arguing its effect on the economy has been positive. What Im asking is how does it move society in the ways of forward thinking or make us more culturally sound. I know it sounds silly and I dont hate the Internet its just been something nagging at my mind. ,NeutralTalk,d1s15nq,2,t5_2xt3f
7545754,0,t1_d2zwkft,Your points are still good I was just trying to add some nearer context. Im pretty happy I found this sub not the inevitable circlejerk reddit tends to become. I agree with your point on the lack of a united front. Currently in the UK its mainly used as a talking point to score political points off each other and to point at how much better off wed be if we left the Union even though people have always needed to show passports and submit to border controls before entering the country since we never subscribed to Schengen. I know that several farright political parties on the mainland have similarly used the influx to leverage popularity lately. A couple of countries have closed their borders too electing to either deal with the refugees they already before accepting more or simply say Enough. Its an awful situation but Im not sure what to propose. Wishes are cheap. ,NeutralTalk,d2zwysf,1,t5_2xt3f
7545918,0,t1_d2zwysf,Context very much appreciated. I took no offence at anything you said was trying to clarify my statements better through the lens of your commentary.As with so many things I really doubt theres a solution. The sad fact is that the refugees have to leave and it follows that they have to have somewhere to go. As generally st world countries my opinion is that the EU collectively has a moral responsibility to do whatever can be done to help the refugees and put an end to the source of the problem. Unfortunately political opportunists abound no matter where you are and illintentioned individuals will take advantage of the refugee influx to bring their own brand of hatred and persecution to the EU. ,NeutralTalk,d2zxmyb,2,t5_2xt3f
7579257,0,t1_d33p7oa,Im pretty new to following politics in general but Ill tell you that I would never trade my government for yours. The cycle is ridiculously long! In Canada we had the longest election in recent history last year and it was fewer than  days long. Personally I like Bernie its long past due that the US moves to universal health care of some sort but I think Hillary will be good for Canadians as she is generally pro trade and you guys are our biggest trading partners. I think Trump is an unmitigated disaster and I was honestly shocked when he won the nomination and its also shocking to see that Trump even has some supporters up here. I hope that he stays well away from the White House for everyones sake.,NeutralTalk,d33q46f,2,t5_2xt3f

8396098,0,t3_4uizmi,By those responsible for national security it is seen as such an issue. The FBI is currently investigating the source of the attack and leak.Your question though seems to deal more with media focus and to that end I think that you might be helped by looking back at some contemporary coverage of other leaks in recent years. It is natural for newsmedia to focus immediately on the content of a leak then to spend the ensuing days covering its security implications more closely. This is simply because the content of the leak is its most important aspect at least to begin with. The fallout is more immediate whereas investigations take time and have subtler ramifications.,NeutralTalk,d5r255r,6,t5_2xt3f
8522931,0,t1_d66wlnd,gt So I think theres clearly a case that Hillary Clinton comes from a school of thought that imagines America as a facilitator of democratic transitions. From my personal experience Id say that her approach saves more lives than it costs on average. But America doesnt own those successes and it isnt responsible for those failures  it is not exceptional in this regard  countries have their own pasts and are culpable for their own futures.Im afraid I think this is an incredibly naive view of the history of US foreign policy. There has only been  years in all US history when they havent been at war and just since WW they have actively participated in dozens of coups and dictatorships from granting diplomatic support to actually training Neoliberal economists to populate government positions Chicago School and actual death squads on american soil School of the Americas.I mean check these lists  countries where the U.S. has supported fascists drug lords and terroristsAmericas Coup Machine Destroying Democracy Since FROM WOUNDED KNEE TO SYRIA A CENTURY OF U.S. MILITARY INTERVENTIONSIt most definitely is responsible in large part not entirely for a large number of antidemocratic coups military dictatorships genocides they provided logistical support and a killlist of  names to Suharto when Indonesia killed  peasents in the name of fighting communism.. So yeah when such an establishment figure as HRC is leading the race while people kick up a fuss about Stein thinking wifi is bad for kids I get pissed off lol.,NeutralTalk,d66xf3x,1,t5_2xt3f

8708027,0,t3_4z7baz,In addition to what ucadetgwladus mentioned there are geopolitical forces at work.Historically Germany has a rivalry with Russia which is a resurgent power whose navy now controls the warm water port in Crimea. But that doesnt get them to the Mediterranean without going through the Bosphorus straight which is controlled by Turkey. Germany and Turkey are both NATO members but in the wake of recent tensions Russia has been making overtures to Turkey and vice versa. If Germany and my extension NATO wants to keep Russia in check Turkey needs to remain aligned with the West. Merkel understands this.,NeutralTalk,d6u50fo,4,t5_2xt3f

9478296,0,t3_5ajgq3,Ill add a bit to celicams comment below its also that without detailed disclosures of Trumps interests the citizenry has no ability to ascertain what exactly are his business relationships with Russian individuals and institutions.  As such the citizenry has no idea what in those extant or otherwise connections could beholden Trumps interests to particular connections in the Russian government or economy.  Trump could clear this all up by releasing more detailed financial disclosures aka his tax returns.As far as do we hate Russia No we dont hate Russia simply because its Russia.  Its easy to get lost in a deep dark rabbit hole discussing Russian topics but in general they have shown quite a willingness to operate outside the established norms of how countries usually interact with each other.   little green men invading the Crimea and establishing de facto Russian control before annexation support for the syrian government when much of the western world was actively assisting many other groups in Syria Russian kidnapping of Estonian security officers etc.  That list can continue.  Russian interests are often not aligned with the interests of the United States government as currently expressed Trump has explicitly stated numerous times his admiration for Vladimir Putin and the russian governmental system thats kind of a red flag given that he as previously mentioned will not disclose his business ties to Russia and has even had his staff modulate Republican policy provisions regarding Russia to be more friendly than they otherwise would have been.,NeutralTalk,d9hek6y,5,t5_2xt3f

9702293,0,t3_5dy8vj,People need to learn and raise their kids on how to consume news. The generation that raised millennials took mainstream media at face value. The younger generation is learned to be more skeptical of mainstream media now but now they face a new problem of falling victim to and learning about the down and upsides of new media which they will hopefully pass on to their children.

10844810,0,t3_5v154g,Its something Ive been grappling with myself.  Ive heard some people say that they will say something in the lines of yeah I voted for trump but Im pretty disappointed about a b and c.  What do you think about it?. For me though most of my friends and family are already well aware of my political stances.  Anecdotally I corrected my friend about Trumps inauguration crowd size and she went on a huge tirade against me and the liberal elite.  I was also accidentally invited to my friends Facebook messenger group but I could see that it was pretty much thed and it was definitely a bit shocking to see friends joking about liberal tears and cheering about the downfall of the establishment.  How do you try to have a rational discussion with these people? Especially since politics has become such a huge part of peoples identities.  Im not sure and that troubles me.  You cant reason someone out of a position they didnt reason themselves into and you cant help people who dont want to be helped.  Not that Im saying Trump supporters are all unreasonable or helpless.  Im just trying to convey that you can only change someones views if they are willing to change it to begin with.  ,NeutralTalk,ddykdwd,8,t5_2xt3f
