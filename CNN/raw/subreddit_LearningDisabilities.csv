5668330,0,t1_cwmem4n,As I was reading what he was saying I thought of audio processing deficiency. That is what I have. It was so hard at jobs. I would forget things all the time right after hearing them. School was hard as a kid cuz Id forget everything and was diagnosed as a young boy. They explained it like this to my parents. Lets say you have  cans on a shelf. Those cans are your memory. When you add a new can the last can falls off. You can only remember very little at a time before you forget. Thats what I have. They said Ill be fine that I only have to take notes a lot of notes. And I do. When Im at a job I write everything down. I let them know I have apd and I have to write things down and they understand. Usually. Ive inly just started writing things down with this last job. Its helped a lot. Ill take my notes and when I go home I type them up in a nice organized way and carry it around to read until it gets ingrained. Also I really try and remember things and repeat them in my head and do as much as I can remember and after someone says things to me I repeat it back to them to make sure I got it. ,LearningDisabilities,cwzpmyp,1,t5_2ysrh
