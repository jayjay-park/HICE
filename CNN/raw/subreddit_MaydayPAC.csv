1458179,0,t1_ciz1bho,gtSounds like youre taking a page from Grover Norquist on this one.Yes Grover exemplifies the principle but all superpacs operate by it. gtBut the pledge doesnt do a lot of good if youre still supporting candidates who take big money from PACs.Not true. Youre conflating institutionalized corruption of our political system with the corruption of the candidates working within the system. You cant change law without getting elected first.  Its near impossible to get elected without attracting and staying on the right side of big money.You cant fault politicians for working within the current system to win and stay in office but you can target them for not working to reform it. ,MaydayPAC,ciz23jn,1,t5_31l4g
1521511,0,t3_2amjco,I really think that the th district of Washington State is winnable especially with Jason Richie the Moderate Democrat. Dave Reichert is completely disassociated with his voters and consistently votes against their wishes. Jason Ritchie is ready to work across party lines to actually get legislation passed in congress which as it currently is a joke. It is completely un efficient with dealing with this countries problems we needs congressmen who are ready to put their personal basis aside and work together for the good of the people and country. Being a politician shouldnt be about political ambition but about serving the people of their districts. Dave Reichert has failed miserably and yet he has kept office for as long as he has. the th district voted for Obama so we know it a winnable district for democrats all Jason Ritchie needs is moblize the younger segment that lives on the west as most identify with the democratic party.,MaydayPAC,cj6zypj,2,t5_31l4g

3300701,0,t3_2xx8xi,Im rooting for you but Im not especially hopeful. Party politics is just too dominant a force. Without ranked preference voting the tactical draw to vote for the party most closely aligned with your ideals is too strong for a third party to break through.,MaydayPAC,cp4i8hm,1,t5_31l4g

3438899,0,t3_2zlja4,One down only  to go!The media is largely owned by conservatives as are most business sectors save hightech so its a surprise that they even reported on this one.  But lets be clear  The underlying behavior was the cause of this resignation not any digging by media that I can see.  It started with a selfpromotional photograph of the Downton office paint job.,MaydayPAC,cpk9drc,2,t5_31l4g
