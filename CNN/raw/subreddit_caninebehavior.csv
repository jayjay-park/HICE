2920563,0,t1_co0059o,Thanks. We have been trying to work at her letting us touch her paws and I will try what you mentioned. You also gave me a good idea I think I will ask my daughter if my dog can watch her very gentle docile pitbull have her claws clipped. They like eachother a lot and maybe if my girl sees Indy calmly allowing it she will get the idea that its not so scary. ,caninebehavior,co02sau,1,t5_2ydmw
