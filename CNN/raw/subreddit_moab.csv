Highly suggest you get this book  Its gotten me through each trip and is well worth the money.As for recommendations Hells Revenge as you said Fins n Things Seven Mile Rim has awesome buttes and a creek bed Steel Bender and Poison Spider. If youre new to Moab offroading start on an easy trail like Rainbow Terrace or something rated easy to get your bearings. Once you feel out approach angles and engine braking youre golden.Also whatever you think you need per day for water double it. Adrenaline and sun will drain you quick. Enjoy man!,moab,cthf97i,1,t5_2subm
6201584,0,t3_3yui6l,My suggestion? Spend a spring month March or April down there and see how it goes before committing to anything. Just stay somewhere cheap with weekly rates like Lazy Lizard and get to know the community while handing out cardsflyers for your services or working at one of the local bike shops. Being a bike mechanic is actually a helpful skill down there so you might be able to pull it off but like everyone else has said  there is no job market in the winter. So I highly suggest testing the waters before getting into a lease or a house. Housing is fairly expensive down there too. You could always do what I do  live up north in the city make enough that you can afford lots of good gear then spend your weekendsholidays in Moab to play. ,moab,cyujy2l,1,t5_2subm
