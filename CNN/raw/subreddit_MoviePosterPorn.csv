In CinemaScore polls users gave the film a B on an A to F scale. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film a rating of  out of  saying While I wish van Heijningens Thing werent quite so in lust with the  model it works because it respects that basic premise and it exhibits a little patience doling out its ickiest nastiest moments in ways that make them stick. Andrew OHehir of Salon.com called it a Loving prequel to a horror classic saying Its full of chills and thrills and isolated Antarctic atmosphere and terrific Hieronymus Bosch creature effects and if it winks genially at the plot twists of Carpenters film it never feels even a little like some kind of inside joke. James Berardinelli gave it three stars out of four saying that it offers a similar overall experience to the  film but without replicating styles and situations. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic wrote that the narrative choices open to a prequel exist on a spectrum from the unsurprising to the unfaithful but van Heijningen has managed this balancing act about as well as could be hoped and although the line between homage and apery is a fine one in our age of steady knockoffs retreads and loosely branded money grabs The Thing stands out as a competent entertainment capably executed if not particularly inspired.WikipediaMore info at IMDb Freebase Wikipedia Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic Netflix  I am a bot.Send me feedback Confidence ..Data sources and other informationrMovieGuidewabout.,MoviePosterPorn,cl2htwd,1,t5_2slxa

In a  episode of Sneak Previews discussing science fiction films of the s and s critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert were critical of Alien. Ebert called it basically just an intergalactic haunted house thriller set inside a spaceship and one of several science fiction pictures that were real disappointments compared to Star Wars Close Encounters of the Third Kind and  A Space Odyssey though he did compliment the early scene of the Nostromos crew exploring the alien planet as showing real imagination.

The film is hypnotically entertaining and it is funny without once being gaggy but it is also rather harrowing. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was the picture that science fiction fans of every age and in every corner of the world have prayed sometimes forlornly that the industry might some day give them. It is an ultimate statement of the science fiction film an awesome realization of the spatial future ... it is a milestone a landmark for a spacemark in the art of film. Louise Sweeney of The Christian Science Monitor felt that  was a brilliant intergalactic satire on modern technology. Its also a dazzling minute tour on the Kubrick filmship through the universe out there beyond our earth. Philip French wrote that the film was perhaps the first multimilliondollar supercolossal movie since D.W. Griffiths Intolerance fifty years ago which can be regarded as the work of one man ...Space Odyssey is important as the highwater mark of sciencefiction movie making or at least of the genres futuristic branch. The Boston Globes review indicated that it was the worlds most extraordinary film. Nothing like it has ever been shown in Boston before or for that matter anywhere ... The film is as exciting as the discovery of a new dimension in life. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars in his original review believing the film succeeds magnificently on a cosmic scale. He later put it on his Top  list for Sight amp Sound. Time provided at least seven different minireviews of the film in various issues in  each one slightly more positive than the preceding one in the final review dated December   the magazine called  an epic film about the history and future of mankind brilliantly directed by Stanley Kubrick. The special effects are mindblowing. Director Martin Scorsese has also listed it as one of his favourite films of all time. Critic David Denby later compared Kubrick to the monolith from  A Space Odyssey calling him a force of supernatural intelligence appearing at great intervals amid highpitched shrieks who gives the world a violent kick up the next rung of the evolutionary ladder.WikipediaMore info at IMDb Wikipedia Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic Netflix Wikidata  I am a bot.
