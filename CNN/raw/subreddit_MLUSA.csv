I did landers last year and it was hot during the day and freezing at night so if you dont want to carry a hoody its worth it. Camping spot at holy ground HG in pretty sure are first come first serve one you arrive at the ground. You park your car what I hear about a mile away and have too carry everything to your camp so pack light. Last year the line up was announced in March I think the first week or so so expect the same this year. As for maximizing your experience I dressed up got tons of pictures taken find myself on picture compilations after the fest. Make kandi make friends the vibes are amazing. It seems like everybody wants to be your friend. ,MLUSA,cobfnp0,3,t5_34k54
