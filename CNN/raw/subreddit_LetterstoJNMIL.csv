10307372,0,t3_5n2ixg,If your DH is first cousins with said cousin the child is DHs cousin once removed.Firstsecondetc is determined by how far back you have to go to find a common ancestor from the person in the earlier generation. If the shared ancestor is a grandparent they are first cousins. Great grandparent? Second cousins. The removed part is the number of generations different. So DHs grandma is babys greatgrandma? Thats once removed. Grandma of one is greatgreat of the other? Twice removed. Hopefully that makes sense. ,LetterstoJNMIL,dcce9qm,6,t5_3i0jl

Youve given her so many chances  how many until you realize that this is just who she is? She cant change it because its her core. And you deserve to have a happy life away from her.,LetterstoJNMIL,df4dd9t,1,t5_3i0jl
