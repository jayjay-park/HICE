7958958,0,t3_4o8wra,Unfortunately the blockchain is very slow right now due to traffic so all you can really do is wait. Now when your transaction does confirm and if the receiving wallet does not receive the transaction we can get you sorted. Hoping for your speedy confirmation please email at gramsupportlelantos.org once it confirms. Thanksgramsteam,grams,d4anua5,1,t5_31c4u
