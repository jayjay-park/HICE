5646902,0,t3_3sdbhq,Gearbest wont refund when items dont show up least not in my experience. I had to get paypal to sort it in the end very recently this was  months after I ordered. This was also despite me posting here and uTheGearbest saying they would help if I msged them my order numbers which I did but made no difference. Just another layer of bullshit from the pretty thick stack Ive gotten from these guys.,gearbest,cwx1x0l,2,t5_33h9d
5650653,0,t3_3oh3yx,Bad new  the shipping has started october the th but it is stuck on The item is preadvised on postnl.post since november the th.Several people say it means  the shipper has already printed shipping label but parcel has not been received by Netherlands Post yet.Gearbest do you confirm that ? Is it normal to have no tracking between China and Netherlands ? On your shipping methods page you dont mention the unable to track for Netherlands Post Registered SF.I know that I have to wait  business days but Im worried to see this preadvised statut since more than a week. How long do I have to wait for before the parcel be taken in charge by PostNL ?Thanks,gearbest,cwxio5x,1,t5_33h9d

7275660,0,t3_4be0hv,I feel your pain.  Having said that I have a few points.. Customer service with Chinese companies is going to be terrible.   smart watches dont have the margin necessary to afford decent customer service.. It sounds like they were going to give you enough store credit to probably order a new watch.. If its not in stock its not in stock.  If the manufacturer isnt supplying new stock theres not much a retailer can do.  Sure this is frustrating but its just not in stock for them to send it.. Last and this is a personal philosophy I buy a lot of cheap crap from China EbayAmazonGB.  I always view it as a bit of a gamble.  If I buy a  knock off GoPro and it shows up working great and as advertised thats a win.  If it shows up and goes poof in a puff of blue smoke  days later sure Id be annoyed but Im not going to get bent out of shape over a  purchase.,gearbest,d256zee,1,t5_33h9d

8499980,0,t1_d63xofe,Ordered an Eleaf iStick Pico to Pakistan. There isnt an issue with customs Ive ordered off of FastTech several times in the past but just the fact that basic service from clicking order to taking delivery allegedly takes so much persuasion is a letdown.Lots of commenters say the same after any assortment of emails calls tickets and sometimes PayPal dispute claims they do receive their orders but that is absolutely not a way for a business to conduct itself.And thanks. Lets see how everything goes. I hope you receive your order  keep us posted.,gearbest,d641sq5,1,t5_33h9d
