5921150,0,t3_3ubp1e,The streams seem alright its getting use to their new time zones they also seem to still be organizing their routines with their business affairs. It is still early so things will still be hectic. Also have to remember its a change for them and some of them are still going through things outside of streaming.  The one thing I did notice a lot of change is in Waffles attitude. Bacon did say he thinks he is moving out soon. Which kinda weak when comes to setting up a business like that. Then again he is the youngest of the group and just graduated so he is still settling in as well and I feel like the real world hasnt hit him yet. Not a fan of his dgaf personality I mean I have that personality as well but I dont bend it over the chat which is your audience. The filter system is timeout heavy that you dont even know what you can and cant say anymore.  He also has a negative thread about him in Liriks reddit which eh dont know why it is even there in the first place.Other than that gripe everyone else seems to be getting things in order which what only been like  months for them as a company. So changes are expected fast and often. ,n3rdfusion,cxvsllr,1,t5_37gc0
