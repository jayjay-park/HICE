4863873,0,t1_cu7d518,Well I visited the link that someone else provided except when I tried to log in with my RUID and pass it said that the login info was invalid for some reason. The I try logging in to my.rutgers.edu and everything is fine. And I didnt follow up after that. But since you ask do I have to create a brand new account on the page so I can enter the lottery? ,ScarletKnights,cu7mmo2,1,t5_2v755

7462611,0,t1_d2px67q,Over on the rNYGiants subreddit there was a flock of Giants  writer who would just link drop and add no conversation. Regardless of whether G is legit or not linkdropping is not cool. I did raise concern with the mods and it eventually ended. No more Giants subreddit for them. Half the front page was littered with their garbage.,ScarletKnights,d2qgb3d,2,t5_2v755

He came in and changed so much about the program including a qualified staff a  meal plan a more rigorous off season training schedule and so much more. Seeing how well he has recruited this year getting players like Clark and Melton and having a top  recruiting class he wouldnt take just anyone at this point. He must see something in this kid that other programs dont. Maybe he just sees him as raw talent because he is  and very fast.,ScarletKnights,d4omcu4,2,t5_2v755
