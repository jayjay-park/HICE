That being said you really need two of them to give him worries as his natural agi of  with being able to take the focus action push the limit to evade which gives him a second focus makes him really hard to hit with one shot.

841780,0,t3_23rhuf,Everyone will tell you to drop all the upgrades for another ship.  But you specified that you want to run  the  rebel ship list.  If you want to run  ships I suggest running  beefier ships the awing is great but  going around on its own is not gonna do a whole lot after it uses its missiles.  If you are dead set on using these  ships i would suggest Biggs  RD shield upgrade Tycho  Homing Missiles Push The Limit Dagger Squad  HLC FCSyou could also change the shield upgrade to stealth on Biggs or change the homing missiles to cluster or concussion to give the bwing advance sensors.  The idea behind the homing is that you get to use your target lock to reroll and with PTL you will have focus as well and that should get you a good number of hits.  I like the HLC better than the Autoblaster because with HLC you always get  dice no matter what range.  Shield upgrade on biggs works to keep him alive and might let rd do more.  And Tycho is a great awing as he can always perform actions and is super hard to kill with an evade and focus token.If you want to do  ship list but are more flexible on the ships i would suggest either of these lists Chewie  Recon Specialist Push The Limit Millenium Falcon Blue Squad  Advance Sensors Blue Squad  Advance Sensorsor Biggs  Shield Upgrade R or R Astromech Wedge  RD Shield Upgrade Draw Their Fire Jan Ors  Ion Cannon Turret Nien NunbThe first of these lists just deals alot of damage and has a lot of hp to eat through Chewie being able to evade double focus each turn helps keep him alive longer the advance sensor are great on the bwings making sure you always get an action.  The second list is more about damage Biggs keeps the pressure off Wedge who can take some crits and regen the shield while Jan has some enemy control with the ion and can boost Wedge for even more devastating attacks and Nien Nunb helps her to shred those stress.,XWingTMG,cgzyoic,2,t5_2vsga

871319,0,t3_243p45,In my opinion and in no order Battle report videos are awesome but terrible. Most dont edit out the downtime in the game choosing movement dials noncritical movement etc.. Additionally there are plenty that get some of the more subtle rules of XWTMG wrong landing on an asteroid shooting through one range effects of secondary weapons. I would say if youre going to do Battle Report Videos keep them fast paced edit out the slow parts and get the rules right. StoryImage battle reps are also fun but I like to see more details than most give. I think the main pieces of strategy to this game are the maneuvering tactics and I find most hard to read or completely lacking here. I find there to be plenty of introlevel stuff on the web not as much intermediate and advanced stuff. Recent FFG posts WRT tactics etc. are excellent advanced stuff but I dont see much other advanced stuff. You have to troll the FFG and BGG forums. Personally I like build lists. What lists did well what the strategies are to the different lists how they did against other lists etc. WRT to Tournament Reports I like the stuff the XWing Podcast guys are doing.

1039573,0,t3_25zsxd,Geez so much negativity in this thread Not bad especially if its your first shot at painting minis. Here are a few tips I do not pain my XWing stuff but remember a bit from wargaming times as already told thin your paint  its always better to pain several thin layers than one thick one  or else youll loose the models details dont go cheap on the paint  regular large model paint doesnt work well with minis try investing in dedicated miniatures paint you might already have but its hard to tell due to the thick layers. if you want to darken some of the inset parts thin down a dark color even more and remove excess water using a cleenex. The color will only be left in the ridges twas called washing i believe if you want some places to have a weathered or used look take some paint remove the water from the brush and stroke the places you want to change gently  the technique was called drybrushing AFAIR and is excellent to provide a worn metal look if you want to combine the techniques and do a full paintover then do it in the following order use base colors for everything paint large areas without worrying with details use washed down darker or even black paint to bring out the inset details dry brush the parts you want to be weathered down using a fine brush carefully paint the detailsHope that helps! ,XWingTMG,chmgcne,3,t5_2vsga

1214503,0,t1_ci65t4i,Wow. Okay.Well that doesnt sound at all like it went to plan! Sincere apologies because that sounds like theres a couple things you should have just had in the bag that really just didnt happen. To start I would recommend you place the shuttle further away on setup depending on what the opponent does. Youre a little stuck because your Academy Pilot will definitely go first and the rest of the TIEs are well really likely to go next to him and then your shuttle isnt high enough to generally react to any enemy placement yet. Id recommend putting them down in opposite corners honestly and bring them a bit closer if the asteroids seem to imply that will be easier. You want the swarm and the Buzzsaw shuttle to be essentially two very different targets with the unspoken implication that either of them will punish his forces if ignored. You want to create that situation and then ideally his forces will split to attempt both at once you should always have an advantage be it more ships or bigger gun on both halves of the field. If he doesnt split and hopes to take one side down quickly you come in from the flank and essentially get free attacks. The shuttle is usually underestimated in this instance and the Advanced Sensors with the Heavy Laser Cannon allow it to park after a focus or target lock and just light up somebody. Well usually anyway. It sounds like you got some really cold dice this match. That happens! It seems like the swarm did their thing by just beating on Ten Numb out of the gate which is very much what you wanted to do. At first contact you would want the shuttle to also have a shot and it doesnt sound like that happened. Ive found that a full stop off the bat is a great trick but generally splits up your forces too much when the shuttle is escorted by anything faster than a Firespray. The shuttle should be coming in and around using Boost as needed to force a Range  shot with the Heavy Cannon. Then you take a Focus or Target Lock your preference and just park for another shot. After the first shot why did the TIEs have to Koiogran? Were there asteroids in the way? It sounds like you would have been moving first were you too close to do a Straight and force either collisions or a Range  shot? Having shots denied generally helps more the person with more ships on the board although with Howlrunner already gone it really wouldnt have made as big a difference. You are right in that theres nobody in this list on the same level as Soontir Fel for midtolategame cleanup and as ever once Howlrunner is down the TIEs have a drastic reduction in efficacy. The shuttle should be providing ranged cleanup after the first pass of the swarm or if the shuttle was the first target the swarm should have a simple enough time of targeting priority ships from the side or behind as the shuttle gets whittled down. That said the dice really have to help with any of it and it really sounds like you had some bad luck in general in the match.If you feel like running it again some time definitely let me know how it turns out otherwise bad luck old sport sorry it didnt pan out better!,XWingTMG,ci690k6,1,t5_2vsga

1288141,0,t1_cieipi7,I would say that as of right now a number of upgrades are pretty common. Push the Limit is good on Interceptors Draw Their Fire is good on Chewie and Swarm Tactics is good for Wedge. Combos like this are fairly common sights. Where as something like Elusiveness is pretty niche and uncommon. So yes the situational ones are kind of meh now. I would temper this by saying the developers are nurturing those niches and trying to find uses for cards. An example is munitions failsafe players complained that secondary weapons felt risky and FF answered by releasing an upgrade that buffs them and makes them more reliable. Another example is Rebel Aces BWings will soon be able to take crew and AWings will soon be able to take two elite pilot skills or one if they couldnt take one before. This will open up even more creative options. For instance Arvel Crynyd and Daredevil both regarded as meh options right now but soon they will be able to be combined. Daredevil will let him use an action to collide with ships Barrel Rolls and Boost can not be executed if you would overlap but Daredevil is a maneuver and as such can cause him to collide triggering Arvels ability does this make him viable? Not sure. Am I going to be giddy to see someone master this technique and destroy me with it? Absolutely.The game is not quite to the stage where really niche picks are totally amazing but I think it is opening up upgrade diversity with every expansion. ,XWingTMG,ciej6eu,1,t5_2vsga

And i dont expect the shuttle to have a wide choice of targets so i dont really see how others ships apart from Vessery coul benefit this crew member.I could use the last point for VI on Vessery but i kept it for iniative as it can protect Echo from other PS pilots especially Carnor Jax or Corran Horn who have enough mobility to be a threat.

1489715,0,t3_2anb9u,I took this to regionals and did reasonable well but lost my first  matches due to dial mistakes. Lost a round of shooting because I set left when I should have went right. The meta had so many falcons who were easy prey for heavy laser canon focus. As predicted I couldnt keep the formation together for long but I did stuck it out for up to  shooting rounds at least in most games. Maybe  but at least one Defender would have fallen out of formation due to asteroids or other ships. I found that I didnt have to be shy about collisions as long as Jonus is around for those list that tries to get Zs in my way. However as my Defenders are PS it was tough to get me to collide. I routinely took out Zs and Academy pilots in a single round of shooting. It was amazing to take out  TalasAcademy pilot at range  rocketed forward for  or  when people was expecting me to do the white kturn and collided with me when they opt to do a short  straight and had a very limited round of shooting at my high agility ships. Another is to not hesitate about barrel rolling for better positioning as the rerolls from Jonus can help offset not taking a focus a little. The next round I white kturned my Defenders and no one can do anything about it. Jonus dropped his seismic charge if any of the ships try to follow with a short kturn as well. Then it was another round of HLC shooting at max range with Jonus giving rerolls to everyone. I wiped out  Tie fighters out of a swarm in  rounds using this and took out Chewie in Millenium falcon in  rounds. My lessons learned was to not be afraid to do red moves with Jonus to keep up as he has no other significant contributions and keep people guessing with moving fast ahead instead of kturning as HLC means I get most the most benefit when I shoot from max range before and after a kturn. The downside is that I can shoot down shoot down  Tala and still lose the game on points if they manage to take down one Onyx. This happens with the Chewie and  Tala list that the regionals was flooded in. He baited me with easy kills with Zs while boosting out of my Defenders arc where possible. That was the first game and in subsequent games I always go after the large ship first and ignore other fighters until they look like they can flank me at range .  ,XWingTMG,cj30e6p,1,t5_2vsga
1498815,0,t1_cj3z7go,Yes it is goofy. These are not strong magnets so they dont repel each other. Magnet is glued to the bottom of the base. That leaves some gap between the base and the table. I then glued a metal plate to the magnet and it still completely recesses under the base leaving a small fraction of a millimeter airway between the metal and the table. The magnet sheet in the tote still magnetically attracts the metal underneath the bases holding them tight. Alternatively you could stack up and glue  or  of the metal sheets under the base. This would probably be another  grams heavier than what I did. I almost did that except most of my ships already had the magnets on them and I really didnt want to use that many metal sheets per ship. ,XWingTMG,cj45fvo,1,t5_2vsga

1853272,0,t3_2ftbwt,A little context I set this up for my RPG gaming group we started running XWing beforeafter RPG sessions to decompresskick back. We had  players. The Rebels played with Luke Jek and Biggs completely decked out. One player ran each XWing.The Empire had  TIEs  Black Squadron  Obsidian Squadron with no  upgrades. Didnt get up to  points but we dont have a lot of figures. The turbolasers were enough of an incentive to drive the Rebels into the trench without blasting them to space dust. We gave the Empire unlimited respawns which worked out well. Anytime a TIE was smoked the Rebels had  turns until his respawn was back in the mix.The biggest frustration was overlapping over the trench. The way we set it up a TIE over the trench could block an XWing in the trench. That just pissed people off rightly so. So the linked mission gives options for mitigating that frustration.Our timer ran out and we gave the Rebels one last turn. Luke was able to get within range  of the thermal exhaust port throw up a target lock he neither used the Force nor let go despite ghostly urges to do so and scored a hit. Death Star destroyed just as it got within range of Yavin. It was epic.,XWingTMG,ckcijdz,2,t5_2vsga

If you play a list thats heavily reliant on RNG  like one with lots of points sunk into missiles and if those miss your list is significantly subpar  then its hard to make it far in a tournament even if your results in individual games might be impressive.Not to diminish his play. This is at its core a game of tactical maneuvering the player who flies better will usually win. I just appreciate the fact that Pauls list exhibits a mindfulness for RNG and tournament play. RNG usually acts as an equalizer between different skill levels so building a list aimed towards mitigating the effects of RNG shows confidence in his ability to outfly his opposition.,XWingTMG,clxbavi,3,t5_2vsga

Would change Concussion Missiles to Proton Rockets since Tycho can get into Range  easily plus theyre cheaper and should hit harder if you have a TLFocus.

Someone suggested putting out like  tracking tokens taking a ship and seeing how quickly you could land on all of the tokens.After a few rounds of this try adding a second ship and keeping it as close to the first as you can while they work together to pick up tokens.  This is a great way to get used to moving a formation.Make sure to boostbarrel with the ships who can do that.Eventually add in rocks and try to pick up the tokens while avoiding the rocks.This kind of practice will really hone your spacial skills and hopefully allow you to pull off some of those I cant believe you fit in there and are able to actionshoot moments!!

Rebels probably have a slight advantage here since Luke will be really hard to kill but if he gets focused early then the Imps stand a chance.Compared to what you have it removes Marksmanship from all ships which is a pretty bad upgrade with the starter pilots.

2733331,0,t3_2rcn8s,To provide clarity to this and some related things youll likely see in the future here are some important distinctions.There are three types of verbs when it comes to tokens. Take a focus action Assign a focus token Spend a focus tokenThe actual focus Action is the only one that is limited. You cannot take the same action twice in one round on the same ship. You cant take an action if stressed. Taking a focus action assigns you a focus token.  But there are other ways to have tokens assigned.  It is important to not that only the Action itself is limited. Tokens can be assigned as many times as you can manage it. For example a ship can take a focus action and then later be assigned a second focus from Garven Dreis but you cannot use Push the Limit to take two focus actions. Spending the focus is the act of discarding a focus in order to turn all eyes into hits or evades.  You can do this even if the number of eyeballs is zero.Assigning a focus and spending a focus are not affected by bumping stress obstacles or any other thing that would stop you taking an action.  At the moment only Dark Curse and Carnor Jax can stop you spending tokens at least no others come to mind.This is another edition of complicated answers to simple questions!  I hope that makes sense.,XWingTMG,cnernt9,6,t5_2vsga

If you attack a ship and knowingly ignore something like rebel captive that is pretty scumbaggy and in other games like Magic would be considered Cheating with a disqualification. X wing doesnt have quite specified infraction procedures like magic unfortunately in my opinion. It really should EDITthere is a mention of removing players from the tournament for unsportsmanlike conduct which intentionally skipping over an opponents ability repeatedly on purpose would count in my opinion as that. Mistakes happen but thats an easy to correct ability for after the fact. The Tournament rules specifically have this to say If a player forgets to use an effect during the timing specified by that effect he cannot retroactively use it without the consent of his opponent. Players are expected to act with respect and not intentionally distract or rush an opponent with the intent of forcing a missed opportunity. I would say that something like rebel captive is easy to correct and it would be disrespectful to skip over it. It would seem that if you were attacking and skipped over rebel captive repeatedly that would fall under the Intentionally distract or rush an opponent part of that rule.Also considering Rebel captive is not a may like something like Garven Dries where its an ability you can choose to activate or not it seems like it should apply whether the opponent says it at that moment or not. EDIT Fly Casual is something that is more for not getting upset over losing staying friendly and for sections of the rules like the margin of error in the tournament guides. Bumping ships happens and sometimes results in things getting shifted a bit. Just try to correct it and move on. But even as it says in that section do not abuse the margin of error. Do not abuse the fly casual mantra.,XWingTMG,co6k8la,5,t5_2vsga

3107227,0,t3_2vprfn,I love me some hot Decimator action I flown it in the past two tournements have have done very well winning one and coming in th in the second flew her off the map in the last one very dumb mistake.Anyways here are three lists I like to run when I play with the decimator.Turn and BurnCrash and BurnAnd my new favorite that I hope to try out at my groups next get together.Dewy Decimator System Mk. Dewy Decimator System Mk.  In Mk. I might get rid of the tactician for something else most likely an ept of some sort but havent decided yet.As for flying tips it really depends on the team composition you plan on running. For my bounty hunter list I generally ran the bounty hunter as a wrecking ball and just threw him into the fray willy nilly really bad idea btw and used the decimator to skirt the firing arcs and get around them with it. It wasnt a bad idea and won me a lot of modified victories but I losing the BH wasnt fun. But say you run a phantom with it youve got to use the Decimator as the focal ship instead of say my bounty hunter and if that is the case you need to build it with durability in mind. So maybe try a lone wolf Kendrik Ysanne combination with Whisper.Other than that if you have the points add a boost because it can help with the survivablity and generally try to position it so that you  have the minimum amount of firing arcs that are plausible on you.,XWingTMG,cok2a2p,1,t5_2vsga

Each tray is tall enough in the old model to hold falcons firesprays and decimators. Theyre just slightly too small to hold a folded up lambda on its side but with the new brown one being slightly bigger they might be able to do that too.

3300956,0,t1_cp498kv,Sorry for delayed reply. I was at work. It has been about a month since I touched this model and as I was uploading the pictures of it I noticed some stuff I forgot to do. engine glow gloss coat on cockpit and a couple highlights I didnt strip the model entirely but I did put it in brake fluid for a few hours. The paint stayed but it removed the factory black wash. I do this for all xwing repaints because I had an xwing that looked fine. After applying the base coat however the panel lines on one engine intake were all globbed up with the factory wash and it lost all detail.I primed in a mediumlight grey spray primer and base coated it with a couple thin layers of a less saturated sky blue.I use liquitex basics brand acrylic paints so i have to mix colors myself sorry I cant give a specific citadel or vallejo color Then I did a pretty dark wash with some India Super Black ink.one drop ink to about  drops of water be careful if youre not using a wash designed for minis This gave it the bluish imperial grey. After I had the main color I wanted I did a thin clear matte coat to protect that layer.Next was doing the off white and standard gray on panels here and there. in the picture its hard to see that theres actually two different grey colors makes it look more pieced together and fits how many times I lose this damn game Another black wash and clear coat on those panels. Followed by the same for the orange. I did a simple drawing before hand to decide where the different colored panels would be planning helped keep me from getting carried away and it becoming too busy. Kath Scarlett styleCockpit and turret windows painted with black paint. I felt as though the panels werent visible enough because of how dark the paint was. I tried something I never had before on a model but saw on the FFG forums. Its apparently called blacklining and I used a superfine point micron pen. You just draw in the panel lines and it gives it sort of a comic book cell shaded look. I think that is what made the orange really pop.The last thing I did before a final clear coat was take like  different colors of grey barely mixed so it had a marble look on the palette and a beat up brush and just sort of stippled it randomly in the areas on the YT with exposed wiring pipes whatever you call those spots. the smiley face and the gap along the front This made that area look dirty inconsistent and interesting. Without me having to paint each individual tube. You get the idea and again it doesnt look too busy.Glad you liked my paintjob dont know how much painting experience you have but this was probably the easiest model for me as it has such well defined lines. Sort of felt like a coloring book. Im used to painting mm scale fantasy models that have more organic shapes with very few large planes so it was a weird adjustment.

Makes it more worthwhile to load them out with ordinance if you get to fire them all before they die. That also lets you take them from most threatening to least very quickly so if your opponent is now inclined to switch targets.

3767737,0,t1_cqkz045,Coming from the UK I used to play k way back in nd edition. My friends and I all collected it heavily and I had a massive eldar army big chaos army and a small imperial guard force as well as small fantasy and epic armies and a necromunda gang. Then they released rd edition. Not only were several of our individual squads suddenly not fieldable but we due to the way armies were organised I found I was now unable to field anything bigger than the smallest possible force eldar armies in nd had a big aspect warrior focus so i only had  squads of guardians. My chaos army was in a similar state and my imperial guard couldnt be fielded at all.So what did we do? Did we buy what we needed to play the new edition? Not a chance we were kids with no money and quite frankly if gw did it once theyd do it again. We told each other wed play nd amongst ourselves but we stopped almost immediately. I eventually sold the lot about  years ago for a couple of hundred pounds except my necromunda guys. When I saw xwing on shutupandsitdown I was intrigued. When my friend and I got the starter kit I was blown away. The ships bases have slots in them to help you measure? Clean simple easy to teach rules? Semisimultaneous movement? Incredibly detailed prepainted minis?The individual ship packs were even better! No army books? Each ship comes with all the rules to use it and all the tokens you could possibly need when playing with it? And the upgrade cards for it work for other ships? For just ten quid? That will buy you a single unpainted unassembled techpriest these days.Seriously gw can go stick a fork in their butt. The way they treat their customers and constantly gouge money is an absolute joke and it always was looking back white metal anyone? whereas fantasy flight continue to impress.Im not saying that having to buy the tantive to get threepio is great but as people have stated you dont need it to be competitive there are plenty of competitive lists out there and its available on ebay as a single if you really have to have it. Its irritating and I wish they didnt do it but it should hardly stop you getting into such a fantastic game.,XWingTMG,cqlr083,3,t5_2vsga

Either way you get to leverage bumping their pilot skill down. The problem Ive found is that there are a number of solid lists that dont care a lot about his ability andor can kill him before its triggered enough times to be effective. E.g. BBBBZ will laugh off the reduction and blast him away the first round of combat. So while I like Mux and have definitely built some synergistic lists with him Im not quite sure hes worth the points.

3932240,0,t3_35hr7i,Im new to Xwing but other leagues Ive been part of do it like thisA few pounds  dollars to join this just goes towards the running of the club  end of year prize.. The amount is usually set by the number of people versus the prizes and usually a bit left over for daily running costs. We did just buy a few crates say a  pack for  and charge a pound a tin so the club always runs a little bit of profit that goes towards the prizes without anyone really knowing.We ran it thus  The Ladder System. Everyone can play everyone else with no direct effect on the league however you can only challenge for ranking the person directly above you or two places etc. That way it keeps the fun there as the best players can still face the other players without having to worry about absolutely destroying them due to losing out in the league and the lesser experienced players can learn a lot from playing them. It also means when the top  players decide to play it gathers a larger crowd as there can be a lot riding on it. The issue is is that if you are challenged you HAVE to accept it. Otherwise the person top will just sit there and not get challenged. The way with doing this is that a lose to a higher ranked player doesnt matter and you can learn from the experience. You also get a lot of grudge matches if someone cant seem to get that win to get them a place higher over multiple times..We also used to play that the person who comes last gets a prize  A wooden spoon so to speak. As I said Im pretty new to X wing so maybe the prizes would be st  nd  rd would be larger prizes wooden spoon would be a little expansion set to help them get better next time around! Hopefully this will give you some ideas. ,XWingTMG,cr4ie61,3,t5_2vsga

4005602,0,t1_craraau,Okay. That would require me to think about the mini swarm COMPLETELY differently than I have been. Most of my success with it has been from thinking of it as one ship that gets a bunch of attacks out the front arc but with really limited maneuvers. Barrel roll to correct sidetoside focus to kill things Kturn when the tight turn is really obvious or would take too long to get turned back around.Every time I fly an Academy Pilot against an oponent who has any idea what theyre doing I have a couple teaching games where an AP was my star player killing at least  named rebels a game basically without any help from anyone else it basically contributes nothing to the battle unless I get some good blocks in. When I fly at least  with Howl usually four because that works better that little block of ships is worth more than the points I put into it.Sounds like I should put the effort in to learn to actually swarm them rather than advancing like a Roman Legion.

4016854,0,t3_36i3d9,The arcs are there for secondary weapons and for abilities like Outmaneuver Tactician Autothrusters... A turret lets you shoot beyond that arc. So yes the CR can shoot its primary weapon beyond its fore arcs but not through that blue line on the CR ship token measured from the center of the base peg defender to attacker.  Huge ships get to perform a primary weapon attack and one attack with each secondary weapon equipped. The CR can spend an energy to roll an additional attack die. The Raider can spend two energy to attack with its primary again the double tap you mentioned.

Also if you downgrade the Black Sun to a Binayre Pirate on the second list remove the shield upgrade and replaced Ndrus Munitions Failsafe with an EU you can give the Binayre a Dead Mans switch so when you use it for blocking itll explode on whatever is nearby. Free damage on a ship thats almost destined to be sacrificed. Lastly I find the BTLA upgrade isnt particularly good on a YWing unless it has both an Unhinged Astromech and an Engine Upgrade. They just fly too sedately for my liking otherwise. I think it comes out as a pt ship then though which is a bit more than you might want to pay for one. Can it take a tooled up Royal Guard TIE?

4735597,0,t3_3fr3ct,The HWK has my vote as the most underrated ship in all of Xwing TMG. Jan Ors is a great offensive enabler Ive run her with DashHLC with fantastic results. Tactician gives her meager one red die some added usefulness and is the only upgrade Id consider for this strictly support ship. If you end up with  extra squad points she could benefit from an Ion turret or blaster turret but as a support ship you want to keep her points low to keep the target off her forehead.Kyle Katarn is my pilot of choice for the HWK. Used cleverly in conjunction with Jan Orscrew and Recon Specialist kept away from direct combat hes a  point evade token gifting machine and improbably effective decoy. Run with a Bwing swarm or Bwing aces or a large turreted ship Katarn adds an annoying amount of survivability to any ships you might be flying. Roark Garnet is himself an interesting pilot for the HWK. Paired with swarm tactics he can shift an entire squads firing order to be ahead of even the mighty Soontir Fel. I found myself liking a turret build I tried with Jan Ors and Eaden Vrill Giving both the HWKs Tactician and blaster turret and giving Jans Swarm tactics means that you can be rattling off  dice on Eaden against stressed targets in addition to the  dice for each of the HWKs. If you can position yourself well and keep your ships close to each other this build quickly burns through single targets.The Rebel Operative is less useful given its lack of support ability. The HWKs depressing dial makes him hard to get any offensive use from and his survivability is nil.,XWingTMG,ctrgqvq,1,t5_2vsga

They could release a core set with two MAs and a Defender genuinely smiling at the concept so long as it contained range rulers movement templates damage cards etc. Moving away from selling the old XWing and TIE in the core set just indicates that they expect the XT and TIEFO to be the ships which are most likely to draw new players in.That said Im totally spitballing and accept that you or anyone else! could be completely correct.Either way Im excited to see new players!Edit for clarity,XWingTMG,cu7b6yi,4,t5_2vsga

One of the benefits to having initiative is you strip peoples focus tokens before they shoot at the shuttle thus making sensor jammer awesome. If you can predict other Soontirs movements well then thats good if not just turtle up every turn. I dont like VI Vader with a supreme lack of Phantoms running around and it allows SoontirVader to shoot at the same time where Soontir can strip shields and Vader can land crits under the shield. Perfect example of this is when facing a Decimator where Soonitr gets rid of  Shields and Vader is free to wreak havoc. ,XWingTMG,cv30dhk,3,t5_2vsga

Because I have very few upgrade cards my Xwing feels underpowered against my TIEs because Xwings rely on their upgrades so much more while the TIEs reach their full potential more through piloting technique. The Ewing with Corran Horn really evens the odds. He has lots of shields lots of attack and can be built to be a pretty good arc dodger or shield tank.

5402251,0,t1_cw253e1,Youre absolutely right about Palpys versatility but Thrawn only takes  crew slot. Thats key  you could run a generic Firespray to carry Thrawn with Howlrunner and x Obsidian TIEs. The Bounty Hunter could move and activate before or after the Obsidians and have a . chance each of granting a token. Im pretty sure that averages to . focus or evade tokens per Thrawn activation which while not remotely as precise as Palp will have an overall greater effect on the game imo. Maybe not a gamebreaking difference...but Palpmobile is already very popular and I think what I have chosen to dub Air Force Thrawn would be a seriously dominant list.You sold me on Bribery. Youre right it being a onetimeuse card really helps balance.But with Sfoils...Biggs with RD doesnt care about being predictable hes not dodging arcs hes just crawling along and soaking damage while jousters or other aces dish it out. If this card lets him protect the rest of the squad from shots for another two or three turns its totally gamechanging. Maybe a balance would be that you take a stress AFTER your Sfoils maneuver is complete? Or you can only use the Sfoil action every other turn?Another way to think about Sfoils...at this cost would there ever be a reason not to take this card and RD on Biggs? For the relatively affordable cost of  points you get a tremendous tank that can soak damage for whatever you want to do with your remaining  squad points. Hed be in every Rebel list you couldnt fly competitively without him.,XWingTMG,cw27464,1,t5_2vsga

5439122,0,t1_cw6lzq3,So you can see the pilot cards and upgrade cards both in sleeves fit perfectly in their respective compartment slots.  The large slots also nicely hold largebase ship templates or as you see in the front left bomb tokensasteroidslasers etc.  I removed a few compartments to stash all the maneuver templates in the top and the range ruler also fits by sliding it sideways between the compartments past the maneuver templates.  Then the smallest compartments have plenty of space to hold lots of tokens and smallbase ship tokens.Ive adjusted a few things since getting more ships these pics are from June. I currently own  of every nonepic ship except I have  Most Wanted  Aggressors  Firesprays  Kihraxz.  Everything fits but I am at max capacity for my Imperial and almost there with Rebel pilot cards.  So for future releases I may need to unsleeve the pilots or buy a second one to split them up.  If you own a smaller collection of ships you can also fit a couple of small ships in the small bins and large ships in the large bins Lambda and Deci and YV will not fit for the record.

5467646,0,t3_3py13r,I literally hosted this situation last night but with  total players  I was playing with my wife who has indulged me in about  games and knows the rules and two friends who had never touched the game. After some reading I decided wed play a furball.If youre not familiar furball matches are where each player controls a single ship in a freeforall match. Search this subreddit and google for a whole bunch of homebrewed furball rules. We used this as a basic rules set.Ive found squadbuilding to be the steepest learning curve...new players arent familiar with cards and combos so they make inefficient choices and it takes a loooong time for them to settle on a ship  then when it sucks theyre super discouraged. To alleviate this I built a bevvy of point aces I thought would fly well and offer a variety of play styles and offered them as a menu to my new players. You can see the ships I built Rebels Imperials  and Scum Note that the Imps have two point Swarm ships  a pair of TIE fighters and a pair of TIE FOs  and Scum has a pair of Headhunters. These are designed to be flown together and if you kill one ship in the swarm you get  victory points not . Not all the ships are made equal and of course Soontir is a beast but they all work well enough to be fun and competitive and I think importantly they teach you about the roles ships fill. There are clearcut arcdodgers turrets jousters tanks and a range of upgrades that enhance those roles.Its hard for a new player to manage a lot of ships  thats a lot of decisions to make a lot of abilities to remember...this format is great and keeps the game moving fast. I think thats the key to keeping Xwing fun  when youre bogged down by analysis paralysis everyone gets bored no matter how many times you play the Imperial March on your phone.It was awesome. Everyone had a blast and whenever you died you could stick with your ship I know I can make this work! or pick a new one Fk it this sucks!. I flew ships Ive never used before and there was no pressure because everything was a big mess anyway. I highly recommend this format for teaching games! Its fastpaced allows new players to focus on a few rules  abilities at a time keeps things moving quickly and lets everyone try out a lot of things at once.

5584314,0,t3_3rlqs8,If you would end your maneuver overlapping another ship thats a bump. You resolve it by moving your ship as far along the template as it will go until its touching the ship that its bumping into. For straights this is easy but for turns and banks you have to consider the angle your ship will end up in. While youre moving it along align the ships rear guides and its front guides with the template as you move it then slide the template out from underneath it.The negative effects of bumping are losing your actions in the action phase. You can still take free actions if you have a card effect that triggers them but you lose the action youd normally get in the action phase which happens after you complete your maneuver. You also cannot shoot any ships you are in contact with during the combat phase. This will only be relevant if you bump a ship after its moved this round or you are bumped after youve moved.,XWingTMG,cwpaaxr,3,t5_2vsga

If its  points you have to equip it on both and therefore is  points. So its naturally rolled into the  points each IG costs. So theres no penalty taking more than one. With the points already counted in the only change is the mechanics change when the title is applied. On the other hand flying the Aggressor in tandem is the most effective way to use it. If you want to fly a ship suboptimally thats your call. Its the same reason why you wouldnt take Nera Dantels with no ordnance.

5715647,0,t3_3te4as,The ability on that attack twice pilot is really pretty poorly designed.  Without taking very specific upgrades or pilots of other ships the ability is mostly unusable.  The pilot ability should be able to work on its own without anything to complement it but then be made better by adding more options to it.You cannot use a large number of the missiles out there because they require spending a target lock or focus and if you spend one on the first attack you wont have one for the second attack.You could I suppose take a target lock on one turn not spend it then a focus the next and use one target lock missile and one focus missile but that seems clunky and wasteful.Theres also an option of using some of the missiles like homing missiles that require a target lock but dont spend it.  The problem with these is that they are balanced in a way to consider the fact that the pilot has a target lock.  The ones that spend it give you a nifty little bonus the ones that dont spend assume youre just going to reroll some of the attack dice.  By forcing a player to not spend the target lock on the attack in order to be allowed to make a second one youre making that first attack much weaker less fun and a waste of points.It needs fixing so that its able to do what it says without being forced to run fire control system on it every game.,XWingTMG,cx5ky9k,-1,t5_2vsga

5798677,0,t1_cxfn9ao,gt down to Well technically but in terms of squad building no. The modification doesnt do anything else so I wouldnt add it for any reason other than to lower the cost. So I would add it to lower a  point ship to a  point ship. It could potentially be worthwhile if the modification itself didnt affect scoring purposes then its lowering a  point ship to a  point ship. Itd be most useful on the TIE Bomber because it would lower a  point ship to a  point ship which would be kind of nice I suppose. But if the card itself didnt count then it lowers a  to a  which could be fairly advantageous if youre really concerned about it being a close match.It shouldnt be free in cost though because then it is just a filler. Its the card I throw on because I have nothing better so theres literally no reason not to. And I dont care for those types of cards.,XWingTMG,cxfvq5u,1,t5_2vsga
5820775,0,t3_3uxpnp,Cool choice on colours. Black ship with red canopy is always cool. But with a flat colour you lose a lot of detail particularly with black.

5827004,0,t1_cxixvux,Also to build off of this. Scum is also the newest faction so they dont have the same core classics to go back to and build on. They are going to be getting another  ships very soon and those might have a better impact on the competitive scene.

5835256,0,t1_cxkgr3p,Actually its pretty easy to justify. Accuracy Corrector is two guaranteed hits that dont require an action for zero points ATC is one guaranteed crit that requires at least one action for one point. Ultimately though its the low pilot skill of generics that means ATC is less of an automatic choice for that systems slot. Higher PS ships might not be in range to target lock during the generic Advanced action phase. Or the ship you target locked might dodge out of arc leaving you to shoot at something else with an unmodified  dice attack. Accuracy Corrector on the other hand gives you ridiculous offensive consistency in a  point ship.Two hits on every attack every time. It even lets you ignore crits like blinded pilot and stuff that messes with your dice like sensor jammer. It lets the ship freely take positioning or defensive actions like barrel roll or evade every single turn without sacrificing offensive potential like other generics have to. Means they can also float stress without losing damage output. Actually the best way to put it into perspective is that the expected number of hits of a three dice attack with a target lock or a focus is about . whereas AC guarantees  hits and requires no action. Its actually about equal to an unmodified four dice attack do that should tell you how important attack modifiers are to producing consistent damage.As for Vader I dont think his systems and modification slots have any flexibility to them. There isnt really a choice thats more optimal than ATC and Engine Upgrade. EU is especially important as having access to boost barrel roll and two actions a turn makes for some crazy maneuverability.,XWingTMG,cxkj1tv,4,t5_2vsga

Thin your paints there should be a uniform flat surface with no visible brushstrokes.  You obscured a lot of the detail along the body..  Use multiple thin coats of the orange so the black doesnt bleed through..  Actually I think I would have painted the entire body orange taped off  the cockpit as well as the areas that should stay orange and then sprayed a thin coat of black or very dark gray over top..  This is impossible to do with black which is why I suggested spraying dark gray instead above but wash the model with black ink to increase the definition of the details.

6316118,0,t1_cz7iib0,I believe that obstacle placement is especially important for this list particularly so when you are significantly outnumbered. You need to find creative ways to prevent being constantly fired at.With such a large initiative bid Jake becomes an invaluable tool for bringing down imperial Aces as well as finishing off regenerating tanks. Hes also a great late game ship due to PS PtL and Autothrusters.Han however is the star of the show. I had one game during the SC where I screwed up with Jake and lost him early only to have Han literally solo down an entire TIE Swarm saving me from a humiliating loss that would have ended my sweep. Han can easily v any other ship in the game and with the absurd amount of rerolls you get between Han and Luke he always does damage every turn. He has a guaranteed  evades each turn and can take a good beating if necessary. Generally if I can get the board down to Han vs. half the opposing squad Han will win.I think new players will struggle to succeed with this squad. You need to be confident with your maneuvers be able to avoid taking risks and have enough foresight to know where your opponent is going to be ahead of time.

6346917,0,t3_42gzd2,The problem you have is that Defenders work best with little to no upgrade. Which the limited collection you have seems to favor.Considering what you have try bringingCorran Horn  RD  Fire Control SystemYou lack a good Elite Pilot Talent but it should still be interesting. Your actions would be either to barrel roll if that means nobody will shoot at you or to evade if someone can shoot at you. Use the turn where you cant shoot to fly away and regen some shields then coming back and wrecking faces with the double attack.Fire Control system is an excellent upgrade on Corran because youll attack twice in a turn meaning at least the second one will have a target lock. Coincidentally the second one is more important because shell probably have used tokens to evade the first one.You can then bring two cheap and lowPS Z to try to block her ships especially her Tie Fighters. Blocking the Defender is only useful if you have a good shot at it or you anticipate a Kturn as in the first case it will not be able to focus and modify his evasion roll extra good if you have Corran pointed at it and in the second case it will not be able to Kturn and will just go straight which will screw up her plans.Youll probably have room for another ship with little to no upgrade either of them will do the BWing will probably be the better choice.The most important thing is that your EWing should not get shot at ever. Deploy it away from her ships if you use Corran youll put him on the table last and try to flank her with it. Finally dont despair. Her ships are a bit easier to play than yours because they are all inyourface type while your EWing is not. In a direct confrontation if every ship gets a shot you will always lose so you have to outsmart her to win. If you want to expand your collection to be better suited to what she has Rebel Aces will provide you a second BWing that will probably fuck her Defender up. Conversely Imperial Aces and Tie Interceptor will provide her with ships that are more maneuvrable type as your EWing is. I would recommend the two Ace pack for your next purchases if you stick to the game.,XWingTMG,czb2obe,2,t5_2vsga

I used Corran Horn  Fire Control System  RD  Outmanoeuvre x Bandit SquadronWarden Squadron Pilot  Advanced Slam  Ion Bombs  Conner Net   Bombardier  againstMauler Mithel  Predator MaybeDark CurseRexler Brath  Outmanoeuvre  Marksmanship  ??Scimitar Squadron PilotFocussing on the Tie Defender with pretty much everything I managed to trap it with the Conner Net then when all her ships clustered in the centre of the table I used the KWing to drop an Ion Bomb to neutralise all but one enemy ship for another turn looping in behind with all my ships and causing a lot of pain. Outmanoeuvre added to Corran plus a close range and target lock gave me a big boost throughout despite that golden turn rolling  blanks in a row on the first attack somehow. Barrel Roll as an action also got utilised a lot to stay out of defending ships firing arc reducing their agility roll along with.After this it was just a matter of picking off the remaining Ties and the Bomber which was relatively easy. I found the KWing to be really useful at a low Pilot Skill meaning it had the extra points to carry a lot of effective upgrades and using that movefirst to drop bombs in the path of Rexler and get out of there. By the time she got my E wing in range of anything the damage had already been done. It was also good to use it as a frustration technique in the nonattack turns following use of Corrans ability as it has a lower cost than Rexler so I could move where I expected that ship to go. The Zs were good irritants as well picking up the occasional point damages but mainly distracting the split Ties until it was too late.  Im pretty chuffed right know your advice helped massively so thank you! Going to keep playing with this lineup for now and get used to it before tinkering.

The TIEX  title vs the TIED title is an interesting choice one where I would normally lean to the D title and go for some ion cannontractor beam shenanigans.  Using the X title turns the Defender almost into the Rebels B wing where youd ideally have a decently cheap filler ship with reasonable staying power.  Having that title on what would probably be the most expensive and highest pilot skill Defender almost seems to work against that.  I would personally use the D title and use barrel rolls with focustarget lock offensively rather than sacrifice the cannon and go defensive with the .

Canonically TIEfo and T would be the most modern but they are still merely upgraded TIEs and Xwings both are rebreathed preYavin designs. The newest things starfighter sizewise in E. VII was the FO Stormtrooper Lander and Emo Rens Shuttle the Rebel Resistance lander was a repurposed Bwing. Well have to wait and see if E. VIII brings something completely new to the table like an Wing an AWing with keel turrets.If we count noncanon then E and K are still the most modern new starfighters in the game. I rechecked and EWing is around  ABY and KWing is  ABY. TIEfo and T are  ABY. So yeah I guess E and K could have been in service in the intervening years and then simply mothballed to return to the good old X.So if we count modern as a completely new design its KWing.

Range  really favours ordnance from the YWing. Proton torpedoes convert two results natively  a blank to a hit and a focus to a crit so even without the reroll theres a chance. I suspect that autoblaster turrets and ion torpedoes might be a fun combo  particularly with the title  create positional advantage and then capitalise on it and with Extra Munitions you can grab  points of torps for just . Not all your fleet need them either  I suspect flechette torpedoes might be a favourite  they are cheap enough and that stress is not to be sniffed at  back before the title I paired them with RA for the double stress and now there is a title I suspect itll still be comedy gold  two stress at range  and then the chance of ion at  and closer...,XWingTMG,d0b9zyt,1,t5_2vsga

6722578,0,t1_d0el803,They are both very good but just at different things.  Whisper works really well just smashing things turn in and turn out where as vader hunts aces.  Whisper is slightly better against TLT spam with the extra agi and both being able to easily get focus  evade to defend.  Vader doesnt have to worry about an init bid or people shooting while cloak is down.,XWingTMG,d0eo81e,1,t5_2vsga
6722627,0,t3_47oye2,This is my personal variant of this list  . I won a store championship with this exact list. Reasons for the changes are as follows.  I had predator over VI on Vader starting too but conceded to reddits collective wisdom that being able to arc dodge and shoot before VI Poe and VI Corran was more important plus ensuring FelVader cant arc dodge you back Shield upgrade isnt as powerful a defense as Fels natural ability to arc dodge. So I prefer to keep him behind them and using him as a flanker. To that end I always prefer Target computer since it allows him to get those sweet range   dice TL focus attacks. Now it is a more fragile Fel but they cant shoot at him if they are dead.  Omega with stealth device is a nightmare to kill. He is REALLY good vs action based aces even without SD but with it your opponent is going to have an insane time even trying to hit him once. especially if he is the last ship in a v heck even a vVader and Omega are your tankier duo that joustsarc dodges when possible while Fel cuts in for hard hitting flanks. You also have a  point bid which usually allows you to give your opponent the initiative. you want to be able to place the last rock and be able to arc dodge them when given the chance firing first doesnt matter at all when you at worst youll would still get a simultaneous fire rule,XWingTMG,d0eoemv,3,t5_2vsga

6734447,0,t3_47w34f,The YV is my pick for Boba Fett crew carrier because it sacrifices the least in opportunity cost when you equip him. As far as faceup damage card delivery Id go with Greedo. A Trandoshan Slaver with Boba and Greedo is only  points which leaves plenty of room for a third crew. Some good options include K Security Droid for harder hitting attacks or Tactician for control. Another option is to put that duo on Moralo along with HLC and K Security Droid to bring a frightening albeit more expensive fire support platform to your list. ,XWingTMG,d0fwfgz,8,t5_2vsga

Scum and imperial resonate better with me but I decided Id aim for equal presence for all factions as opposed to specializing and rebels are next. Ill be keeping an eye on this topic for more ideas.

7129080,0,t1_d1oh7yy,The EPT slot that allows taking Deadeye is what ties it all together.  It allows the JMK pilot to move to cover arcs and fire at whatever it wants that enters range.  It forces the opponent to fly very carefully but they dont have to.  Its a low risk high reward setup.  The focus then combos perfectly with the R mechs to cause maximum damage.Two solutions if needed Remove the EPT slot Increase the cost by  points weve seen  point lists so I dont think a  point bump is effective.The first is the easiest but would FFG do such a thing?  The second option would require them to reevaluate the costs of the other JMK pilots.  The CS would cost the same as Manaroo so do you bump her and the other pilots up the same amount?  And if you do do you then reduce the cost of the Punishing One title?  Youd still be able to field  JMKs but youd have to make some actual decisions on loadout.Again all dependent on whether or not JMK really turns out to be a dominating list.,XWingTMG,d1ohv9y,12,t5_2vsga

Think about it the rules say IDs are allowed except for situations described in Unsporting Conduct. Unsporting conduct includes collusion and score manipulation.Ok so maybe Tod leaving the tournament is a bad example. But when he gets matched up against his seven year old he obviously knows he can win. But it is his kid and he would rather let the kid have fun so they draw because this is just supposed to be a fun event anyway.The way I read the rules it is allowing IDs in cases that dont fall into unsporting conduct. Those situations can certainly arise. However unsporting conduct expressly forbids score manipulation which TTG is arguing includes most instances of IDs. ,XWingTMG,d1r53hl,-1,t5_2vsga

It is not a big leap to say IDing to get the right score for the cut is manipulating your score. For the record I hardly have a dog in the fight. Ive played in  tournaments in  years. Im just looking at what the rules say and it seems to me that scoring manipulation is not defined and allows the TO to rule IDing either way.

7161358,0,t3_4dltxh,Brad my hats off to you for an excellent game and a great run at the tournament.I had heard something about some draw or no draw allowing me to sneak into the top  while the final games were being played.  At the time I really wasnt focused on it.  Im not sure of the details Ive heard differing things but Im not sure it matters too much.  I made the cut and that was that.I agree with Brad though.  The intentional draw rule is generally bad.  I think that each player is trying to accomplish  things in each tournament.  The first is to score  points each game thats the primary motivation.  The second thing is to not lose  points and a below  MOV can be devastating to your place in the standings.  Allowing players to sidestep the second goal is bad.  At Hoth each player should have had to risk a loss in each of the  rounds of play.  I dont fault Brad and his opponent in any way for taking the ID.  It was smart and within the rules.  Playing would have been an unneeded risk and if the rules allow it dont take the risk.I do understand the argument in favor of the ID rule though.  I was at  and would be paired against another  player.  The  players were paired against each other and at least on paper were playing a better opponent that I was.  The s have a harder path to making the cut.  If they lose theyd have been  and with the same record I had following a win by me but due to a loss and a win by me their MOV would have been behind mine.  So for all practical purposes the  players were in must win games.  Most of that was due to the resetting of MOVs between day  and day .  I did really like that though.  Without that none of the s going into day  would have had a realistic chance of doing much of anything.  It kept the stakes high for everyone participating on day .  No one was eliminated before the day even started.Both sides of the argument are valid.  Maybe the best way to solve it is to have a HighLow pairing in the final round.  Pair the X players against Y players that can make the cut.  Then the Xs arent cannibalizing each other and the Ys have to play a harder game than they otherwise would have.Ultimately though I personally feel that everyone in the tournament should play the same number of games and risk  points the same number of times that everyone is risking.Ryan Fleming,XWingTMG,d1s6ecd,47,t5_2vsga

Consequently youve become harder to hit with your evade token and autothrusters against unmodified attack dice.  The Valen Rudor list seems better than a concussion missile.  Get more PS and a real useful defensive action to get him out of arc of another shot. Seems decent against UBoats firing munitions at range  also.

There are a few leagues including at least one on Vassal that maintain a ranking system for their members.I think such rankings are better suited to either smaller communities or games with much more consistency than XWing has. Chess doesnt have new releases every year that change the game nor does it have such a substantial luck factor. Comparing rankings in a game like XWing across all the players at a local store or in an online league is somewhat effective.

7404271,0,t3_4gqapa,I like the theme of the list! Here are some changes I would makeTycho is actually not a good fit for SoT because his ability only lets you perform actions while stressed. You still cannot however perform red maneuvers while stressed which is a problem because SoT treats your maneuver as a red maneuver. This means if Tycho uses SoT he would have to do a green maneuver before being able to use SoT again.I also dont think SoT is great on Jan since her dial is not great anyway and if shes stressed shes never modifying her dice. Instead of Jan I would choose another ship that likes being stressed such asIbtisam   Bwing Stay on Target  BwingE  Hera Syndulla Ibtisam loves stress because being stressed allows her to reroll one die when attacking and defending. SoT gives her the stress and Hera lets her use SoT turn after turn. Her lower pilot skill also isnt an issue if Keyans Intel Agent tells her the enemys maneuver beforehand.Not sure who Id pick to replace Tycho. Ezra also likes being stressed but he prefers to be able to take an action and then gain a stress like Keyan. I was thinking maybe Wedge with BB and SoT? You get some cool BR gt SoT shenanigans. But then youd have to shave a point off somewhere. Could bump him down to Luke.,XWingTMG,d2jtf7p,2,t5_2vsga

Even if it was the last attack you arent going to remember these things with perfect certainty. At that point you just move on.

8050739,0,t3_4phc6v,heres something I threw together in squad builder.  Seems to play alright in the benchmark site but I dont have the ships to play it on the table.Curb StompTarget Lock Sharing with Ordnance and Control pointsPilotsColonel Jendon LambdaClass Shuttle  Ion Cannon  Weapons Engineer   Tactician  ST Maarek Stele TIE Advanced  TIEx  Advanced Targeting Computer Major Rhymer TIE Bomber  Extra Munitions  Plasma Torpedoes  Advanced Homing Missiles  Guidance Chips The idea is the Lambda shuttle passes out target locks to the other two ships usually to the bomber but occasionally to the TIEadv as the situation dictates.  Meanwhile the shuttle is handing out stress and ion tokens to control the enemy.  Major Rhymers ability makes great use of the Advanced Homing Missiles overly limited range.  The Advanced Targeting Computer procs Steles pilot ability constantly so you can hand out the most effective crits per the target.Caveats  The list isnt finished and can definitely be tweaked.  The TIEadv is often out of position to receive the target lock from the shuttle which pretty much destroys Steles action economy forcing him to target lock sometimes when he should be arc dodging.  The only reason I went with Maarek Stele was because I didnt have enough points for Vader.  I was pretty underwhelmed with Tactician so I could free up some points there but then you lose the control aspect.  Anyway its a work in progress.,XWingTMG,d4kz8ls,1,t5_2vsga

8121487,0,t3_4qgeqj,Whenever I build training squads I make a few general rules No primaryweapon turrets. No secondary weapons. One upgrade per ship at most. Those upgrades should be limited to Elite Pilot Talents Crew and Droids that modify your own dice or movement. Stressinducing upgrades actions and the like make the game more complicated than it needs to be for someone learning the game and should be avoided. System upgrades are generally pretty complex interactions for new players and should be avoided. Squads should be mostly generic pilots. But its OK to include one or two named pilots with selfmodifying combat or movement abilities. Avoid combo style pilots or anyone with a special range associate with their ability Wes Biggs Garven Howlrunner Serisu most HWKs etc Good pilots are Luke Wedge Vader Backstabber Mauler Mithel Scum Kath Talonbane Cobra etc. Avoid ships with a lot of special qualities like Defenders Aggressors Phantoms.Hope this helps.

Im also glad they ruled it as  separate actions and kept it consistent with the existing rules.For those of you unfamiliar there was an email from one of the game designers who said that you couldnt use gonks  actions in the same round with Experimental interface because both actions were on the same card. In the past it was ruled you couldnt use the same action twice but there was nothing about using different actions from the same upgrade card. This rule makes Gonk at least somewhat usable.

Vape is too pricey for a singleuse Wingman.   point tops.  Voort is great!  I think Runt should have his pilot ability based on a die roll to add that random element to which personality will be in play.  That Antilles Intercept is perfect.  Fits both the maneuver and Wedges pilot ability.  Even the image is spot on.  So Ive had a PS Kell Tainer who can attack immediately after executing a maneuver before his action and if he does he cant attack again for the rest of the round.  So he can get the jump on some aces and is pretty good with RD  Predator.  After playing with him quite a bit I feel hed be popular without being overpowered.

The Ywing is a  seater craft which translates to a turret slot. The implication being that the second seat mans the turret. The Arc meanwhile has a crew slot and the aux arc because like the Firespray its gota crew capacity of three.So yeah the second seat is represented mechanically by the aux arc.

What is the timing for resolving both Dengars counter and the TIEDs primary attack?On the FAQ with the flowchart Dengar activates at step  after defending or after attacking abilities that trigger another attack. The question we had is is TIED also a step  ability? The big counterpoint is that the other two examples BTLA and Gunner have the keyword immediately in their wording and TIED doesnt.Really important question too! Because if TIED isnt a step  ability then should Dengars counterattack destroy the Defender it wouldnt be able make the primary weapon attack. If it is this means that in any situation if you attack with a TIED youre guaranteed to be able to do both attacks even if you get taken out by a retaliatory strike such as Dengars or RP.

Often times its the kid from out of town thats flying TIE Punishers or Rebel HWKs or something like that. Its extremely important to understand WHY youre losing. Are you crashing into rocks? Is your opponent ending up behind you? Do your dice just seem to suck? You need to discover what pillar of XWing youre failing in. If your dice are just betraying you consider reworking your list to allow rerolls or remove the random element entirely with something like Accuracy Corrector.  Maybe your positioning needs work so try approaching your opponent from another angle or keeping a spare proton bomb for when they end up behind you and least expect it. Learn HOW to fly each ship. You dont joust with TIE Interceptors they will explode. If you like jousting try to find a ship thats good at it like TIE Defenders. The best lists will suck if they arent flown correctly. Before you place your maneuver put yourself in your opponents shoes. Where would YOU go to best ruin your squads day? Plan for that. Dont lose confidence. This is important. I know how shitty it is to feel like youre terrible at the game. Maybe you are terrible but so was I for a while. What made sense to me wasnt working so I thought outside the box and started to see where I was going wrong. Learn from each loss instead of just thinking well I got outplayed,XWingTMG,d5u7gds,30,t5_2vsga

Rebel regen you should also be fine with kanan and barrel roll. Probably against a swarm too. Glitterstim is good against swarms. It probably wont do much against aces.

Its worth noting that the Rec Spec  Agromech combo got a bit of a nerf in the latest FAQ since you can no longer spend Focus gt gain  spend TL gt spend another focus that last step is no longer allowed. The biggest problem is that if you get blocked you lose most of your effectiveness since youre mostly action dependent. PTLKEngine Dengar doesnt care as much about being blocked.I personally would drop the Z for a better Dengar. I rarely find a single Z in a scum list to be very useful useful especially in what seems to be intended to be a two ship list.

The build makes for one of the most successful and tournament winning ships the Rebel have had. But its very expensive and usually limits you to a two ship list hes usually paired with another very strong build on Dash Rendar.I think it is possible to run him a little lighter and maybe fit him in a three ship list but youre going to have to be pretty frugal with the other ships. Possibly have one of them be a Z blocker. If you want to run him lighter Id suggest dropping Engine Upgrade and trading PTL for Veteran Instincts. Run that version of Corran with Biggs to back him up means he can spend the first few round being offensive as hell and you should have enough points left over for a decent ship.

The action is going on over on my opponents side of the board and I ask him to flip and execute my OL manoeuvre a hard turn while Im sorting out tokens and stuff my side of the board.

Dash was at  hull at this point and I knew that chances are really low for me to kill him without getting a new round started. Theres  minutes left so I ask the neighbouring players to watch the game so theres no more shenanigans. Dash is down to  hull when Carnor is done and has only one clear shot in return but he still manages to stall the game by pretending not finding his dice.

For one thing it makes them more of a riskreward and less of an autoinclude in every list.  Second the lack of evade I think is an attempt to get people using EPTs other than PTL and Juke hopefully something different than VIAdaptability.The dial and title make the Protectorate a knife fighter.  With autothrusters if you get in range one you always have an evade coming your way.  Inarc the title kicks in.  Out of arc AT kicks in.  You still have three green dice and most turns a focus token.  Predator Outmaneuver or Fearlessness depending on your joustingarc dodging preference or maybe Opportunist are all good options.

I would recommend shopping in person at a hobby store for striping tape so you can see exactly how wide the tape is before you buy it. With that said its pretty cheap. A single roll will last quite a while by my estimates.For larger ships larger lines and covering pegs Im using Tamiya mm masking tape.I got pretty decent lines out of both products though I had to be careful with my paint application. The striping tape I could pretty much paint over and thats what I did to get my XWings alternating stripes. I had to do a little fixing at the end but overall I felt good about it.When I was painting my Falcon I used the masking tape on a couple sections like painters tape on a wall. It was mostly there to keep paint off of adjacent faces while I painted the main hull. For stripingedges it worked but was just slightly less effective. I had to use it more like a guideline because if you apply too much paint it might get under the tape a little and mess up the edge.,XWingTMG,d6nminh,2,t5_2vsga

8775782,0,t1_d72mo7u,For boosts and barrel rolls the point of no return is when you declare a direction either verbally or by placing the template down. Personally I dont even care about the verbal part what matters to me is placing the template. If someone says Ill boost left I mean right! then I let them go right. Its cool. Fly casual and all.If the boost or barrel roll doesnt fit you can do a completely different action if you like. But if it fits you must take it. Barrel rolls can be a bit tricky for close maneuvers since you can slide the ship around a bit. For target locks you declare intention to lock a specific ship. Measure to it. If in range you have to take the lock. If it isnt in range you can take another action. You can kinda cheese the TL action to figure range by declaring a lock on someone you KNOW is out of range measuring to them and oh look just so happens theres this OTHER ship that IS in range but Im not locking that one Im locking that one way over there and its out of range so I think Ill focus instead...,XWingTMG,d72n286,4,t5_2vsga

Since its casual I proxy any cards I need as does my opponent. Our rule for games is basically we can proxy any pilot or upgrade cards but we need to have the actual ship. If I am going to buy new ships I would rather spend it on stuff that I would want to use in other games too. With the FO coming up short against the standard TIE it sounds like I may be better off grabbing the Vets a bomber and some other small ships and try running Omega as a stand alone loaded ace using my existing model.Thanks for your input. ,XWingTMG,d7ms5x4,1,t5_2vsga

8952541,0,t3_52whyp,As a newer player I can definitely say that there are times that the amount of Large ship play is too much. Fortunately my local community is very focused on bringing fun thematic lists more than anything else. But there are a few things Ive noticed that really undermine the parts of the game that got me hooked. . Large ships with turrets primary or otherwise. Turrets are incredibly frustrating I would argue. They should have been IMO a rare thing  maybe  per list. They remove a lot of maneuver and arc manipulation from the game. This is a bit tangential. . Large ships that are too points efficient. The JMPK is the obvious culprit. Its pretty insane that you can put three of these on the table. Ive seen fun novel and interesting lists that end up using multiples of the same large ship as I am sure we all have. I would suggest for your needs that perhaps a better suggestion would be that you can only bring one of each type of large ship per match Brobots excepted. A Firespray JMPk and YV wouldnt offend me much at all as opposed to just x contracted scouts. However realistically the FFG model seems to be that nothing ever gets nerfed  rather answers are provided by subsequent expansions. The idea of banning large ships will never really gain traction because of this. I think what we need to hope for is that there will be some sort of new answer to make small ships more appetizing or more points efficient. ,XWingTMG,d7nyn30,4,t5_2vsga

9009083,0,t3_53nogn,Your Tarn Biggs Corran list. I like it a lot but I think youve missed something.Corran takes FCS because it sets up nicely for the double tap shot in the end phase. Thats key though it happens in the end phase. In the scenario you present Tarn switching his target lock to cover himself after Corran fires first means Corran then doesnt have Tarns lock helping him when he fires second.If Corran keeps FCS and partners with Tarn he becomes super accurate. Focus and a reroll on the first shot target lock on the second. At one point cheaper it also lets you take the standard build  drop that Hull Upgrade for Engine Boost which if hes going to be  points he really needs. In the potential future age of BMST I agree that Advanced Sensors might become the more sensible way of playing Corran. But given the point balance of this list Ive got to say I still prefer classic Corran.I love that this actually disincentivises shooting at Tarn though. As you say in the example you give one target lock gets used three times. If Corran goes with FCS and therefore still having the friendly target lock buff come the second shot is redundant the opponent is encouraged to leave it hanging uselessly on Corran  which means not shooting at Tarn! Its brilliant. With Biggs covering Corran youre then either forced or encouraged to shoot at Biggs.And if youve played it right and got Tarn to take his TL on Corran at the start on a turn with no combat when there is combat on a later turn hes then not being shot at so gets to keep his focus for an attack which at PS will probably be after everybody else has already been shot at and shot and so are hopefully tokenless.This just gets better the more I think about it. ,XWingTMG,d7ur1hh,3,t5_2vsga

And then Thane himself is a pretty juicy target because of his ability. So combining them all but ensures that the other person will take that ship out first. I bet theres some fun stuff you could do with Thane and some other action card like vectored thrusters or Lando or something maybe combined with Biggs or Wedge to attract the red dice away from Thane.And unfortunately the Shara combo doesnt work CI had it in my original post but Navihawk pointed out that Shara states When attacking before her ability so no defensive buffs.

9051184,0,t3_548gf3,It looks like youre off to a good start but I would recommend thinning your paints just by adding a tiny drop of water to the paint or your brush when you dip your brush in.   Youll get a feel for the right amount after a few tries it should apply smoothly and not be runny or bead up and at first itll look too thin but thats where layering comes in.  Thus thinned painting in layers avoids the globbedon look that you usually get just dont forget to let each layer dry otherwise you end up scraping the paint back off with the bristles.  Miniature painting is great for practicing to be patient and take your time and dont be afraid to wipe off sections with a rag and do them over if they arent going right.If youre planning on some full repaints also consider methods like basecoat color and drybrushing.  The basecoat is an underlayer applied before painting on the top color and it has an effect on how that top color will look since paint has some transparency.  Most commonly youd use a black or dark basecoat for dark colors and a white or light one for light colors however this is not a rule.  For example if a ship thats going to be colored white is also meant to look weathered a dark basecoat is appropriate.  For a model thats unpainted a basecoat also helps the next coat stick and fortunately XWings out of the box paint jobs take to new paint really well.Drybrushing is a method used mostly for weathering or highlights and it involves wiping most of the paint off of the brush then brushing lightly amp quickly over the model so that the remaining paint catches on corners protrusions  and edges.  It takes very well to multiple passes.Inkwash is basically what it sounds like a layer of very runny ink that seeps into the crevices of a model to give them that shadowed look and I apply it not that differently to drybrushing using very little ink on the brush.  Its normal to paint a topcolor layer over the inkwash since the ink tends to tint it.Im no expert by any means but these things are the core of my model painting and just using those three together gets some fantastic results.,XWingTMG,d7zt3w5,12,t5_2vsga
9054190,0,t3_54a6pz,Here are some very generic answers to go with your very generic questions! Before the game consider which lists give you the most trouble. Select obstacles that benefit you and harm them. For example swarms hate lots of really big obstacles. Read up on Turn  posts and articles. This is all about placing those rocks. The approach depends on both what you are flying and what they are. Some lists are jousty and want to fly straight at the enemy. Some lists are dodgy and want to circle around. Turrets usually want to make you chase them. Choose an approach that benefits you more than the opponent. Joust if you have the advantage. Do something else if you dont. As a side note Palp Defenders are very jousty and can often survive the first volley with double or even triplejumpmasters especially if you find a way to make them split their fire. Look up the finals of the Canadian national tournament for an excellent example. ,XWingTMG,d8063jq,1,t5_2vsga

9060913,0,t1_d80xj96,Then you dont understand how powerful RD is. If we assume that a shield upgrade is fairly priced on a agility ship with evade tokens pretty much the situation where it is worth the most youre breaking even at a single shield regen and getting  points free with every additional regen. RD is almost guaranteed to give you more than  points worth of defense.Your upgrade on the other hand struggles just to break even. You have to spend a target lock so youre only trading  on action economy. Then your opponent gets the chance to boostbarrel roll after you do yours or just pile up defensive tokens against your weaker now that you have no TL shot if they cant get out of arc. Lets say the reactive ability is equal to having an intelligence agent to see where your opponent is going to end up intelligence agent is actually much better but Ill be generous. Intelligence agent is  point so you need to use Whistler three times just to break even. With no shield regen your ewing is pretty lacking in durability especially without target locks from FCS allowing you to take evades instead of focus so how likely are you to live long enough to use Whistler three times? How likely are you to live long enough to use Whistler seven times the equivalent free points to using RD twice?So thats a really shaky argument for Whistler ever paying off his point cost while RD almost always does and often comes out ahead by a huge margin. RD every time.,XWingTMG,d80z5b4,1,t5_2vsga

9076875,0,t1_d82td2d,Thanks for the advice!  The other antiDengaroo list Im working is this Hera with EU and an Advanced SLAM Warden Conner Bomber.  The problem with that one is the leftover  points once Ive decked those two out meaning I either need to drop something on those ships to squeeze in a Zeb or GSP or some other small blocker load some more crap on those ships that wont be really useful upgrade to Miranda which makes dropping bombs on ltPS difficultSo its still got some work needed.Also I am certainly not a toplevel or even midlevel player but Ive caught Manaroos from competent players before with only a ghost Kanan or Chopper.  Granted it was on a Manaroo aces list but with Nien NunbHera allowing me to go with anything from a  straight or banks after I see Manaroos move if Manaroo gets pinned against the edge she cant get away so easily.  Bringing big rocks helps that happen but isnt necessary.  However Ill certainly agree that its not a sure thing.When you say fast ships what do you mean?   speed ships with boost?

9088012,0,t3_4enuos,Having flown all  of them against UBoats I have to give the Lambda a lot of credit apart from just carrying Palpatine. It really contributes by soaking damage it requires  torps to kill unless they slowly plink away with dice primary and can dish damage out too. Blocking prevents the focus required to fire the torps as well. If both aces have Autothrusters and can dodge arcs consistently you should win  every time. By contrast triple aces dont have the benefit of a big hunk of metal blocking flight lanes and dont have Palpatine to save them when they whiff a dice roll instead simply having more ships that are annoying to catch and kill. If one of the aces is an x Defender they can feasibly tank a bit though because it wont instantly die from one torps shot whether it gets blocked or not.,XWingTMG,d848djq,1,t5_2vsga

They were caught off guard with the Ion Vessery and how it royally messes up peoples plans by forcing them to move. That in turn makes it easier for me to know where at least  of their ships will be. And I agree the TieD plays a lot differently and requires more thought. It is all about slow rolling early on and trying to get R shots off early to force their move through Ion and then either King behind them or doing a gentle bank  barrel roll to get close and stay out of arcMy only issue with X and its use in the current environment and its main downside is its predictable.

If you both have ships on the board the player with the most points of ship  upgrade still in play wins. Half points for half total health hullshields on large base ships only not small.When youre learning playing games to the death can sometimes take forever.  A time limit will make the game more intense and youll start to get more turns in per game as you get more familiar with playing.I bring this up because I havent really played  point games outside of the starter scenario which is like ish points  TIE vs.  Xwing.

And the Inquisitors attack while never more than three hits unless Prockets is not to be sniffed at either especially when facing mostly undmodified green dice.

I also saw that you have everything so obviously this will continue.Aside from that the only thing I would get a second of is the ARC and Protectorate. The ARCs are all unique which makes things interesting and they work well together and with other ships. Their upgrades work well with others as well. They are very good overall addition. Likewise the top  protectorate pilots are the most fun in a list Ive had in a long time and they were not even mine. You cant get mad at someone rolling insane amounts of dice. Not a lot of dice mod but enough dice to make up for it usually and its all just the luck of the dice.,XWingTMG,d8xia5k,1,t5_2vsga

9329030,0,t1_d8ydn49,gtThe problem right the is that it was an assumption. Its a foolish assumption because thats not how the game worked before and all the discussion has made it apparent that a lot of people wouldnt follow that assumption for that reason.Its a foolish assumption that players actually know the rules for the game theyre playing? Well its foolish to assume they do since many people are woefully ignorant of the rules the amount of times I had to explain that target lock rerolls counted as modifying dice when I started running Oleader was unreal but its not foolish to assume they should. And no the game has always worked this way. Attack X has always meant that you must have X in order to perform the attack. The only thing thats changed from how things worked before with Biggs is he can now no longer force the attacker to choose a weapon that can target him. Literally the only thing thats changed since the last FAQ release with regards to this.gtThe way the timing chart is laid out the only criteria for targeting is arc and range costs are an entirely different step. It was therefore not unreasonable to assume that you were technically allowed to target things even if the attack would fail because you couldnt pay the right costs especially because thats closer to how it used to work.Wrong. Its not an entirely different step. Its a different substep which is part of the same master step . Declare Target. It isnt a reasonable assumption to make that you can technically target things that you couldnt pay the costs for because paying costs is a substep of declare target and the failure of any substep causes the entire step to fail. If you cant pay the costs you have failed to declare a target its as simple as that.And again this is no different from how it worked before. Its just different from your  incorrect assumption of how it worked.,XWingTMG,d8yitu1,1,t5_2vsga

9384290,0,t1_d95ihxu,For which part? I just winged most of it. I hadnt painted anything modelwise in over  years so Id forgotten most of what Id learned building models when I was young.The engine glow on the  was the trickiest part. I followed a couple guides and suggestions from some others in a Facebook group. Its decent but I still think I could do it better. Basically I used a lot of very thin coats starting with a dark blue and then lightening the shade every few passes eventually ending with white. At the end I wet blended the white with a little light blue. I was going to try stippling but couldnt find or approxmate a deertoe brush yet.The engine glow on the others was much much simpler. Primary Red Bright Orange and Primary Yellow. Start with a few coats of thinned red add some lightly thinned orange in the center on top of that then a dot of straight unthinned yellow. Only takes a few minutes each not counting dry time. It could be better Im sure but Im happy with it. Much much better than the dead black engines they come with.For most of it its just the usual suggestions Wash with soap and water thin your paint and use multiple coats use small brushes I prefer a  and  liner and keep the brushes clean. I dont use fancy paint except for the Vallejo blue wash I used on the EWing. Its all basic acrylic from craft stores or box stores like JoAnn Fabrics Ben Franklin and even WalMart. Just put a small drop of paint on a pallet or paper plate add a drop of water and mix.If you havent tried painting anything yet dont worry about messing up. You can always use simple green or even gently scrape the paint off if youre unhappy. I kept some toothpicks nearby that I was using as undo buttons ,XWingTMG,d95iwbe,4,t5_2vsga

I did use him for his ability but this is the ability I wanted him for. Many people hated on him on a level with at least palp aces and it turned out that the fix is to simply make him work with the timing chart.To be honest this doesnt really change much for me except that people think he was nerfed and now underestimate him. Theres not many weapons that will change their priority. If anything people will stop gimping themselves if they did so knowing that I run Biggs. His biggest threats were also either nerfed trip scouts or reinterpreted in Biggs favor Bossk happens before RD for sure now so Im pretty happy with this.Id much rather things work as intended in a makes sense and there are options around even if I dont use such options than to feel like he is just one big solid  point block of cheese.,XWingTMG,d9biulx,1,t5_2vsga

9660199,0,t1_da3ot3w,He does hand out a free action. But read the card carefully the ship you pick performs the free action not Vader. You seem to be reading it as the ship with squad leader performs an action focus and then the chosen ship receives the benefit of the action a focus token. What actually happens is the ship with squad leader chooses who gets the action and then that ship performs one of its actions subject to all the normal rules for performing an action. So in the case of target lock the ship receiving the free action would have to have target lock on their action bar not have already taken a target lock action earlier in the turn not be stressed have the ship to be locked within range  etc. Similarly Vader could squad leader a TIE interceptor a free action and the interceptor could use it to boost even though Vader does not have boost in his action bar.In the case of your example list it works just fine ruleswise strategywise its a bad list but thats a different question. Omega Ace has target lock on his action bar so once Vader assigns him a free action he can choose to target lock as normal.,XWingTMG,da3tlfl,1,t5_2vsga

But the easiest way to get one for sure is going to be just buying another Core Set. If you dont have both core sets yet strongly consider buying whichever one you dont have.I recommend against trying to get just a damage deck on eBay or elsewhere online due to high prices and the odds of complications such as missing cards. A core set has enough other valuable stuff in it that its usually a good purchase anyway.,XWingTMG,daugzew,1,t5_2vsga

9876285,0,t3_5grjmt,Seems interesting for sure. Id still be concerned about damage output. Braylen takes his high point cost and helps justify it by his consistency on offense with Gunner and his passive modification out of the back. A pair of two dice attacks with mods on only one seems like it will have a pretty tough time breaking through a lot of the defenses we see. Burning Palp on the SnapShot attack seems like a risky proposition as well.,XWingTMG,dauwihq,2,t5_2vsga
9876947,0,t3_5gr39g,Id be curious to see an imperial probe droid or something along those lines.  Ideally theyd be cheap would probably deploy on the board somehow would give you insight  scan your opponent Maybe looking at a dial?  Maybe analyzing defenses to give a buff to your allies? and would have relatively low attack Perhaps even  with a  arc. to counter the cost and abilities.  Scum could go all sorts of different directions.  Mining Guild TIE seems like an obvious choice...but man is it boring.  Im still holding out hope for a Skipray Blastboat.  It fills a niche for Scum for that elite starfighter a la the EWing and TIE D.  But if they havent released it yet they might never put it out.  Rebels are harder.  Im not sure what Id recommend.  Maybe something a bit more tricksy than the straightforward  regen stuff they have currently?  Poke the writers on Rebels to release something new on the show?  Maybe start a trend to releasing MK II packs and have an update with new pilots for the YWing and include a new title  turret?  I dunno Im game for hearing ideas though.,XWingTMG,dauzmbd,2,t5_2vsga
9884624,0,t3_5gw4mz,Honestly I think breaking it up into a campaign is the only way to pull it off adequately. The key is the order of the campaign. Id say go XWing gt IA gt Armada gt XWingSo the first mission would be the team insertion so an XWing mission. Get the ship carrying the crew to the base past the Imperial patrol. Set certain conditionals to make it easier for the Rebels or Imperials in the next mission depending on how this mission plays out. Like dont fly within range  of the TIEs or theyll scan the Rebel ship and warn the base. If you succeed give the Rebels two extra command cards in the next mission or vice versa but you get the idea.Second mission same thing with the end goal being disabling the shield generators. Now this is the fun part because we all know Rebel plans have gone awry at this point before. So set the conditional being strict pass fail for the Rebels and if they knock the shields out then theyre out in the final mission. Set a terminal thats a distress beacon for the Imperials. If they can reach it activate it and hold it until the end they get an extra ship for the Armada mission.Third mission Rebel fleet drops out of hyperspace to find the target vulnerable or with Imperial reinforcements incoming. Gotta make it to a certain point on the map to trigger the end of the mission like close to the asteroid field at one end of the map. Id probably run the map long ways and maybe with one  extra turn to add a little more suspense. Now heres where the stakes come in. You can either deploy the fighters normally or keep them docked on a ship. Every Rebel Squadron that makes it across the finish line gets an extra corresponding ship in the final XWing game. Every Squadron that doesnt well they dont even show up because they already died. Same thing for Imperial Squadrons. But heres the catch if they ship theyre docked with goes down with them still on it those ships are lost. Final mission have the initiative go to which ever side has less ships and then let the battle rage. ,XWingTMG,davznol,1,t5_2vsga

9968688,0,t1_db6wlyg,Well yes ideally if you could pick that but theree currently no way to do so through shields.What Kylo Ren does is if you land a critical damage even if his opponent still has shields it allows to to hit him through shields with a pilot crit of your choice.  This will most likely be blinded pilot.  If Corran hasnt shot yet he can use his standard shot to flip the crit and then do a singletap at then start of the end phase.  If he has already shot he can flip the crit at the end of the end phase.  Either way hes not shooting the next turn.  Also a second landed crit from Kylo will kill him outright because Corran only has  hull.Long story short Kylo can make it so Corran only gets one shot the whole game then dies in two hits.  On a commonly theorized build with RAC predator hotcop and Gunner each turn RAC has about a  chance of landing his chosen crit on a focusevade Corran with no further modifiers.W,XWingTMG,db6y2zt,3,t5_2vsga

10160965,0,t3_5lgpko,No mistake.But you might want to try a few games before making more choices. Most all? ships are cool but sometimes one develops a special fondness for one style of play and decides to focus on that. Before I played my first game I thought Interceptors were the coolest. Then I died a lot and wasnt so enamored anymore lol thats an euphemism. I got back to them but there was a detour where I settled on jousting lists while figuring out how the game actually works...But eh if youre comfortable with the expenditure and you get a kick out of owning lots of beautiful small Star Wars ships I sure wont be the one stopping you from acquiring more!An alternative view mostly driven by players who attend tournaments regularly goes along the lines that there are only  ships or combos worth buying at any one time. This is a matter of taste  you have to decide why you want all those ships and cards.

10167700,0,t1_dbwdo0d,Just because Fenn gets bonuses when facing enemy ships at range one doesnt mean you should be putting him there all the time. You get bonuses but so do your opponents. Fenn not having an evade action is very detrimental to his survivability. He isnt remotely the hardest ship in the game to kill neither is the Phantom. You dont want attention on Fenn early. Its actually relatively easy to focus fire him because hes an ace without an evade action and doesnt tend to arc dodge as well as other aces since he lacks the combination of boost and barrel roll.

10191664,0,t1_dbyg91k,Im  certain that Rexler triggers only after the second Cluster Missile volley but any damage cards dealt during the combined Cluster Missile attack are able to be flipped up.Firstly Rexlers ability is specifically an after attacking ability meaning it occurs during step . Theres no question about that. Bossk is a bad comparison because Bossk is NOT an after attacking ability it is a when attacking ability whose timing window is right before step .Secondly TLT and Cluster Missile attacks dont really count as two separate attacks. They are actually a single attack that is performed twice. This is why cards like Tactician can only trigger once with TLTs.So basically Rexler is performing a single attack that consists of two volleys. His ability triggers during step  after both volleys have gone off. The specific trigger is after you perform an attack that deals at least  damage card. Did the entire Cluster Missile attack deal at least one damage card to the defender? Then yes Rex gets to flip all the cards dealt during the combined attack. This language is the same reason for the current interaction between Gunner and TLT. Gunner only triggers if BOTH TLT attacks miss. Why? Because TLT is really one attack as far as Gunner is concerned and if either volley of TLT hits then the whole attack hits.,XWingTMG,dbza5fm,1,t5_2vsga

10233953,0,t1_dc3dk2d,Kind of actually but perhaps not in the same way that youre thinking.  TIE variants as a rule have high agility and low firepower typically manifesting as  attack agility ships.  The TIE Advanced had the problem of just not being able to put out enough damage to matter and so it got the title fix and ATC so it could pretend to be a  attack ship.  Looking at all the playable TIE aces they pretty much universally either have  attack power natively Soontir Whisper Defenders or pretend to Inquisitor Darth Vader OL with Juke and TL.

One worry though  and I hate to bring this up  is that with the way these are worded you could put Demolition on Biggs and then surround him with three Wingmen with each of them triggering once per round. Three free evades on Biggs is more than enough to keep him more or less intact while your squad gets off  heavily modified torpedoes and beyond.

However friendly ship abilities can be arranged in any order.The title and Kanan triggers at the same time so the player determines the order. If you went over debris you want Kanan first then title because the title doesnt work if stressed. If you did not you want Kanan after title to clear the stress from the title.other examplesI have Nien Nunb with stressbot and snapshot. Situation you have rey with kanan and finn. You pass by Nien so Rey is facing away from Nien.a I have initiative Nien uses snap. He is not in reys arc so her and finn dont trigger. She becomes stressed.

That usually means youre not going to be rolling dice thus Gunner is an expensive dice modifier that youre not likely to use much.The Ghost and Shuttle build that is doing the rounds right now is Kanan Zeb and Biggs with TLT Rey and Finn on the Ghost with FCS  all three of those providing modifiers to frontrear attacks and Shuttle allowing for the TLT to be shot at the end of the turn or  TLT shots in a turn instead if your opponent is vulnerable to them TIE Strikers in particular.

Players have an initial opportunity to resolve any situation among themselves but any player may alternatively ask the judge to make a ruling. At a players request a marshal can review a judge ruling and provide a final determinationIf a spectator believes they have witnessed a breach of the rules in a game they are watching other than a missed opportunity he or she may bring it to the attention of a leader.A few clarifications including the use of the word cumulative for MoV in tiebreakers and some further bits of organisational etiquette keep cards together clarification on discard scoring and dont share a damage deck because it screws up those probabilities.Anything I missed?,XWingTMG,dcckr81,8,t5_2vsga

10389622,0,t3_5orude,The ships point cost is determined by many factors. One of them is what slots it can equip upgrades in. At first look here I see the two xwings are paying the built in cost of being able to take for example an astromech. These astros can be cheap and really add to the flavour of your list. I would recommend paring down the points spent on epts like marksmanship and try to cram a few astros in. Im not saying every time fill every slot on every ship. But here I see room to boost what you can do each round such as giving you more greens or a free barrel roll pre movement. I would also like to see Ten having a better way to ensure crit results.

10455167,0,t3_5pr39e,A ship with Attack  seems useless unless it has alternate weapon options and powerful support abilites. This ship has neither and the three system slots arent particularly useful  with one exception. That exception is Accuracy Corrector. Get two hits every time! Fly five of these and that be kind of OK but it doesnt seem like what you intend.So I think this concept is pretty unworkable unless it came with ways to make the Scout better able to benefit friendly ships like a Navigatorlike ability to change the dial of a friendly ship or some offensive support abilities. So Id suggest some upgrades like this Scout Data Feed  system  pts TIE Scout Only. At the beginning of combat you may select a friendly ship within range . After it reveals a maneuver you may rotate its dial to another maneuver with the same bearing. WideSpectrum Targeter  systems  pt. When a friendly ship attacks an enemy you have locked you may reduce their agility by one.The ship itself is weak enough that these abilites should be powerful. ,XWingTMG,dct74oj,7,t5_2vsga

10456709,0,t1_dcsfgej,From playing with and against these builds. The ease of victories I had with Defenders and Dengaroo is obnoxious.x and Mindlink cant be counter played. You bump or stress them and they still get focus or evade tokens.Palp combined with other freebie defensive tech makes it impossible to ever kill anything without even more extreme hyper offensive modifications that can just automatically put  damage into something. Most ships in this game either cant survive the things needed to kill Defenders andor cant ever damage hyper defensive things like Defenders.All of these top builds act as gatekeepers. I cant run a Kirahxz not because its a point or two overcosted but because its  attack dice wont be able to do anything to hyper defensive things like Palp Defenders and will just get annihilated by a Party Bus or Dengaroo.If you cant see why a Kylo crit splashing against a shield and double blinded piloting something two turns in a row just for them to finally limp away on low health and get PS killed is a problem for the health of the game I dont k ow what to tell you. I want an explanation of how Im supposed to explain this to a new player why their AWing or ARC with a range one shot on RAC takes an automatic Blinded Pilot when it only lost shields.

10456990,0,t1_dct36xs,Im not really a fan mostly because of how weird the maneuver changes can get but after hearing from Paul himself in the article I can see now where he was going with this at least.The bluff aspect makes it so BoShek doesnt really control your opponents move any more than if they had to take an uncertain guess at your move during normal planning. I honestly see its greatest impact being as an increase to variance the lists that are the most impacted by BoShek are the ones that fly predictably because it knocks out the reliability crutch that keeps them optimal whereas lists that are less predictable can make BoShek just as detrimental to you as the opponent if you poorly guessed the original maneuver and if youre not intending to use him hes wasted points. And at the end of the day the ability itself does give the opponent the final say in where they end up so they can at least try to salvage their move which is more than what can be said for getting Tractor Beamed onto a rock with the front guides overlapping.,XWingTMG,dctekp0,3,t5_2vsga
10459147,0,t3_5pt9x2,First of all while you can use the Rebel HWK dial and ship you cannot use the ship token or pilot cards so you absolutely need Most Wanted for that ship.I think Talonbane in the Kihraxz and Zuckuss in the Mist Hunter make an interesting combination that could go with one of the others but I think you may need upgrades from other sets to make them good. Honestly I could see running Guri in the StarViper with them and using Atanni Mindlink on all  but to run that in a tournament you would need to buy  Punishing Ones just for cards and probably other expansions. In casual proxying is no big deal though so could be a fun list.If you do get Most Wanted Palob in the HWK is pretty good especially with a Ywing running TLT on both. That leaves enough points for a couple cheap ships which could be fun as well.How well is kinda dependent on you.

At the very least I think they are fun and wish you happy hunting.,XWingTMG,dctnems,3,t5_2vsga
10459498,0,t1_dctodzp,The person who flew it ended up saying that the key to it is using engine upgrade to make sure only  thing can shoot him at a time. Its hard to trade inefficiently at that point with  TLT volleys especially when they have to go for the range  biggs shot instead of Kanan. Biggs can buy you a lot of time for your TLTs when only a small chunk of the list can shoot at any given time and even at range  theyre shooting with  red dice enough for kanan to grab an evade token action for with a focus from Rey on the offchance their red dice get lucky. In my game specifically I didnt like the clock that the list put me against since Reys creating an actionless focus every turn we dont fight. When combat hits if he gets actions thats  focus tokens with  TLT shots and Kanans ability on top of FCS. Good luck trading evenly against that especially if you have to target biggs. your two dice against a focused biggs isnt going to get you anywhere.,XWingTMG,dctoubk,2,t5_2vsga

Unfortunately Imperials dont have a cheap missile carrier like the Z so you cant copy the list exactly.  Maybe something with TIE Advanced  Advanced targeting computer  tracers.  Hux an unblockable damage onto one Tempest Squadron Pilot who sets up the target locks for the rest of the swarm?Tempests can all evade get the Hux focus.  One fires traces to get the unblockable damage through and get target locks for the others to use their advanced targeting computers.  Dont know what to do with the last  points.

10511565,0,t1_dczkykd,My issue with PTL is that some ships are required to use it to work.  Norra Wexley for example.  Since you need a target lock and a focus every turn to be competitive with her youre limited to PTL for your EPT.  Either that or you have to have another ship that can pass target lock or focus tokens consistently.  Making PTL unique would severely hinder lists that have someone like Norra in the list.  You can no longer run a PTL Dash for example with Norra.With the Rey crew card its possible that you can use a different EPT but youre still going to run out of focus soon since Norra isnt very good at disengaging.Other ships like the Interceptor just need two actions per turn and you cant get away with another EPT.I definitely use VI and PTL more than any other EPT.

Being able to deny say a VCX a shot by ramming into it while still getting a rerollfocusd shot on his wingman is not bad flying. And saying hotcop gunner is outside the argument for predator when predator makes it a lot better is silly.  Even if you remove hotshot copilot and just have gunner predator becomes a better option since you can modify both shots.  If Im not allowed to include HSCP and Gunner in my comparison youre not allowed to use Engine Upgrade which makes the pilot skill way less relevant.Nevermind that PS is becoming less useful by the day as more and more meta lists tend towards the mid PS range.,XWingTMG,ddgob5t,2,t5_2vsga

10756643,0,t3_5tw3lg,Sometimes the Weekly Rules Thread shows up a bit late but lets try to answer those questions anyway.gt Burnout SLAM on the Lancer  if you equip  do you discard both if you SLAM? Rules as written would seem to suggest this.With the way the card is worded yes.  You would discard both Burnout upgrades the first time you SLAM.gt If Boba Fett crew is used to remove a hull upgrade or the Heavy Scyk Title this lowers the hull back down to the original value immediately correct?Correct.gt Is there any weird running I would need to worry about?Not sure what the question is here.gt If a crit is dealt under the shields with Advanced Homing Missile and Boba removes a Shield Upgrade and the defender has full shields card value   what happens to the extra shield?Im not sure on this one.  I think this would be similar enough to the FAQ of him discarding a card that allows another to be equipped that the defender would keep the shield token.  If they have a regen ability though they could only regen up to what their new max is and not up to that original  value.gt If you have Greedo and the first attack that targets you does not deal any damage or any damage cards the second attack that targets you would not benefit from Greedos effect correct? This would also be true if the first attack was a Tractor Beam correct?Correct to both.  Greedo triggers The first time you attack and the first time you defend so if the first attack is a tractor beam or a miss youre safe.  Similarly if you miss the first shot and Gunner you wont get to deal that face up card on the Gunner shot.,XWingTMG,ddpgu2a,1,t5_2vsga
10764113,0,t1_ddq3usx,Not OP but I view them as kind of a slightly squishier but more maneuverable and cheaper T. You lose target lock but gain barrel roll. You have the exact same stats except for one fewer hull point. And you can stick a turret on it The most expensive version is Hera at PS  for just  points. Speaking of Hera her or Sabine in the shuttle are really fun to fly.Basically I like to take them when Ive already got two solid ships and I dont have a ton of points left but dont want to go the low PS blocker route.

The rest just comes form plastic on table time. The short answer to all of your questions is yes but the cool part of xwing is how situational every thing is. All the best pilots and lists can radically change they way they behave form match to match. thats why X and Dengar are all the rage now they can joust or arc dodge depending on whats on the other side of the table. I have found that a lot of the next step info you are looking for is found by just asking your opponent after a game how you could have flown better. I always try to ask this win lose or finial salvo.  I also look to be able to answer that question for my opponent if its info they wish to have. I never offer it as you can come off as a bit of as ass. but the most critical ting to do is never blame just the dice and just keep playing and learning.,XWingTMG,ddrnvvx,1,t5_2vsga

10801033,0,t1_ddu08ho,Well one example you can get by looking at this video.I set this up as a practice case four stationary ships in the corner and fly my Kwing in paying very close attention to range control.  With the flexible Kwing dial and SLAM its possible with practice to consistently set up situations where you can fire only on the lead blocker Z in the video while being out of range of the three castled ships or at least all but one if youre off slightly.  Once the Z is dead he has to break fortress and then your Kwings can romp.  The real trick is executing this in such a way that if he breaks fortress early youre not completely out of position or spread out you dont want him to see an isolated Kwing break out and gun it down before the others can punish him.Also one major consideration when approaching a castle is to control movement tempo.  Is my opponent Kturning every turn with a defender?  If so I time my approach so that he either has to break his castle early bring another blocker in to fortress which will be facing the wrong way and also group his ships so my bombs are more deadly or so that I get into striking range while hes turned the wrong way.Another things thats good to be familiar with is how to drop your Kwing exactly where you want it down to the  inch.  You can do this easily with a Kwing because of SLAM.  For instance a bank into a straight a straight into a bank or a bank all leave you facing the same direction in roughly the same place but slightly off of each other so far as x and y translation.  If you know you need to be exactly here you can probably hit it with a Kwing.If its not worried about taking a weapons disabled token a Kwing can do a     or  straight maneuver.  On top of that a bank SLAM into the opposite bank goes slightly further than a straight but not quite as far as a straight etc.Im usually not shy about checking for Target Lock even when I know the enemy is out of range.  I just want to get more information to use to control range.Thinking about it now I should find or make a movement blossom for the Kwing.  Ive got a pretty good intuitive sense of how to get to a certain place with SLAM but nothing as concrete as a full diagram.  I imagine a full movement blossom would be a good resource.W,XWingTMG,ddu1t6x,3,t5_2vsga

The array of large ships we see is in part due to their balanced offensivedefensive nature combined with their ability to carry more varied and beneficial upgrades than most small ships.  In general they bring a lot to the table  literally.  What I think I am saying besides the obvious is that it is far more challenging to structure and perform well with all smallship lists because it requires a lot of clever design work and even more clever flying.  I have done well with a few allsmall lists but it does take guts and tact to make it work well.  ,XWingTMG,dej0y2f,1,t5_2vsga
11039167,0,t3_5xmqwb,Homing Missiles on Miranda is a very nasty alpha strike weapon. Optimally you want to have a focus together with your target lock thats why you often find LongRangeScanners on her. You do not spend the target lock to shoot the Missiles. You also want to use her ability to add one additional attack die to your throw. Which means you will have an five dice attack with target lock  focus for rerolls and modifying and the enemy cannot spend any evade tokens Defenders are crying right now. ,XWingTMG,dej9qi4,2,t5_2vsga

11053255,0,t1_dekqvh5,The YV is a lumbering giant slow and hard to tun around or evade attacks but heavily armored and packing a mean punch. Its the only ship in the game with two  degree forward facing auxiliary arcs giving  degrees of primary weapon coverage from its front. It makes approaching the YV headon particularly difficult as attempting to arc dodge can lead to range one side shots with miscalculated maneuvers. This gives this large ship a particularly potent offense with forward cannons and missiles in jousts and alpha strikes.The trouble is that while headon attacks and approaches from the side favor the YV when an enemy vessel successfully maneuvers to its rear it becomes particularly hard to shake them. With no access to a Kturn or Sloop this vulnerability needs to be accounted for by YV pilots. Using the edge of the board is particularly useful as you can mitigate the room needed to fly behind you to one side letting you use your white turn and red turn to potentially get flankers back into your side arc. You can also use the edge with the dials  red stop to slow roll and engage your enemy on your terms. Engine Upgrade to give you access to the boost action can also help you maintain arc but it comes at a cost. Account for the fact that the YV is a bludgeon and that it will lose effectiveness as the game goes on in your list building. Since the YV is the only Scum ship with multiple crew slots with three it can advantage of the factions wide array of cheap crew to make interesting combinations. These are best used in my opinion for cheap offense with the generic Trandoshan Slaver pilot or for the Ace hunting firepower of Bossk.The Trandoshan Slaver is costed at  points and is pilot skill two. With no ability and generally the last to fire at its PS its best used as a third ship in a list to block and provide offense with its three crew slots. The most well known combo is the Usual Suspects of LOM Zuckuss and Dengar. Equipped with all three the Slaver becomes  points and gains the ability to consistently reroll attack dice and significantly hamper your opponents defense dice. Other crew options can include Outlaw  Tech to open up the YVs dial to use more red maneuvers Inspiring Recruit to help your squad with stress BoShek for bumping and many others.Bossk on the other hand costs significantly more points at  and has a much higher pilot skill level of seven. His ability is what makes him shine with the ability to cancel a crit on attacks that hit to add two hits. This gives him the ability to deal out lots of damage quickly. Hes also the only YV pilot with access to an elite pilot upgrade letting him access a whole slew of excellent options to enhance himself. The most common of these being Veteran Instincts to boost his PS up to nine or Crack Shot to improve his chances of pushing crits through to utilize his ability. In particular he shines when using either a Mangler Cannon for consist use of his ability or Homing Missiles with Guidance Chips for large burst offense. Using the Usual Suspects of LOM Zuckuss and Dengar with these combos can deny your opponents defense dice and enhance your attack dice to the point where he can make many low health aces pop in a single attack. Popular combinations with him are two ship lists because of the cost to fully upgrade Bossk usually around  points. A Jumpmaster with Dengar as the pilot or a LancerClass Pursuit Craft with Ketsu Onyos tractor beam token assigning ability are great options.Hopefully this is a helpful start to playing the YV!,XWingTMG,dekv8r9,6,t5_2vsga

We wanted to get some of the baseline ideas available for people to begin to digest while additional thoughts were put to paper.Doctrines are likely to be viewed as optional in Squadron Commanders play. Not all ships need them. Subpar ships do. Protectorates as an example are already in a REALLY good spot. T XWings? Theyre not. Not even close. We want to get those Ts on the field and let them be competitive. We dont want to boot Protectorates into the stratosphere.So where well see a lot of Doctrine work is sidegrades rather than upgrades. We see that already with Blackmoon Squadron. R Astromech is really a sidegrade. It enables something cool and new without disproportionately boosting the equipped ships.It may very well be that choosing a Directive is required in Squadron Commanders. Do you then choose a Doctrine enabling ships like the Punisher and T to hit the mat and be viable or do you alternatively ? What goes in that blank is a question right now. Or as another option do you choose either a Directive OR a Doctrine but not both?Questions questions. Wed love input where possible.  ,XWingTMG,deve9m4,1,t5_2vsga
