3013808,0,t1_co9t9bo,Yes I did. When creating a DB table you can configure throughput. Now REGARDLESS of what acutally goes into that table and in my case it was about  queries in total within a whole day Amazon charges the maximum throughput available  million writes per day is roughly equal to  write capacity units  . writes per second. I had configured  read and write capacity units.  I blame myself as far as I shouldve read the pricing terms thoroughly before giving them my payment info or.... creating tables. And this is where I start to blame Amazon. Creating a table is as easy as in MySQL and a phpmyadmin interface. The form for the throughput is even easily overlooked and there are of course no warning signs attached.    I paid  Dollares for a measly database table just sitting there.,complaints,coado9g,2,t5_2qhkf
