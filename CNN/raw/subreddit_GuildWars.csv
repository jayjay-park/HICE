1336234,0,t3_298vmw,Two things that werent mentioned yet first you can use this list to find Elites that you have access to already no need to wait until you get the best elites grab some that look good and make some simple builds based on those.Secondly you may have your heroes set to avoid combat and for the most part you want them set to defensive until you get more comfortable with the content.  Inside a mission open the party list P by default and click the numberbuttons next to each Hero to bring up their skill bar they have a dove shield and sword icon also that represent their AI stances.  Set them all to the shield maybe set your healer to dove avoid combat but I find they can be set to help out until much harder content.Thirdly I just thought of this you could try and give your self and your heroes Perfect Weapons  If you dont need the gold text and fancy skins you can get lots of statperfect weapons very easily and they make a huge difference in your wholeparty damage output.Also remember to identify and salvage Runes those help heaps.,GuildWars,cijxxyd,4,t5_2quyl

1671984,0,t3_2dh8hj,If you find lore to be an important thing it is imperative you purchase or atleast play the campaigns in order of which they happen according to the GW timeline which is in the following orderProphecies and Factions first they happen at the same timeNightfall it reveals a lot of additional information about the plots of both Prophecies and FactionsEye of the North this will reference the other campaigns on occasion but mostly serves as a bridge between GW and GWAlso important to understand is the gameplay differences. Prophecies allows for a selection between  professions Warrior Ranger Monk Mesmer Necromancer Elementalist whereas Factions and Nightfall each allow for  Factions adds the Assassin and Ritualist and Nightfall adds the Paragon and Dervish. So you may want to pick your starting campaign according if you should wish to play the assassin ritualist paragon or dervish. Another key difference is that Nightfall was the first campaign to introduce heroes customizable NPC party members so if you plan on using a lot of heroes youre pretty much required to take Nightfall along aswell EOTN also introduces heroes but fewer than in NF aswell as EOTN beginning at level . Bear in mind that youll always be able to take along real people if you can find them and noncustomizable NPCs known as henchmen.Personally Id say purchase Prophecies and Factions to begin with Guild Wars is the most fun if you explore the world yourself and in the beginning youll have no idea what builds are effective and what not thus making the customizable NPCs worthless anyway. After youve completed atleast one of these campaigns you should recognize enough skills to be able to build your own heroes which is much more fun and rewarding than pulling builds off of the interwebs. It will also give you the most in terms of lore to start with these.EOTN really should be purchased last it provides no new professions no new elite skills and generally the least amount of usable content. It also occurs latest in the timeline and is a level exclusive area. Its main use is to add some form of bridge to GW aswell as ofcourse the Hall of Monuments.EDIT As for a place to buy Id recommend ga.com its currently unfortunately out of trilogy packs but it does sell the campaigns seperately for a mere . each and EOTN is even cheaper.,GuildWars,cjpwypz,1,t5_2quyl

I used to have a pre searing character a few years ago for dye hunting there was a rumour at the time that dyes had a higher drop rate there but I think on reflection they probably didnt its just that you get  of the loot . The run I used to do was through the catacombs. As such I took a monk as my primary profession for the smiting skills as they do double damage. I think that levelling up to  takes a silly amount of time. I wonder if maybe going warrior would be best as your armour might be slightly higher but then again very low mana...hmmm....Fire magic does a lot of damage but does it do the most? hmm.....Another thing you could consider doing is never handing in the secondary profession quest as then you could swap them out whenever you wanted. ,GuildWars,clfdddl,2,t5_2quyl

2839504,0,t1_cnqa1e9,Alright small calculation regarding whether or not GW is still financially viable.Blizzard uses a  per month subscription plan for WoW this resulted in a profit of about  million per year across .M users.This results in a yearly money gain of .B of which only M was profit. So they have about B in server and developer costs across .M users which boils down to a cost of  dollars per year per customer in costs.Now obviously WoW is open world still has active developers an active support and generally is harder to maintain. Obviously this is also a very crude estimate because some people dont pay  per month but rather buy subscriptions each year ofcourse theres also the initial purchase and the ingamestore to consider.Now the question is how much easier is GW to maintain? The most accurate and easy test I can think off without needing knowledge of Anets inner workings is as followsWoW is GB GW is GB. The amount of data in a game is roughly proportional to how hard it is to maintain.Now obviously GW also has no more active development so lets round WoW up to GB and GW down to GB more or less fair. This means GWs operational costs per customer are  times lower resulting in  dollars per year per customer in costs.The purchase of a full set of Guild Wars costs  dollars meaning the break even point is approximately  years for a customer assuming the average person will spend an additional  dollars in the ingame store we end up with approximately  years til breakeven.All in all I think youre right. They probably are still making money out of it. Obviously this is just a ballpark estimate but yeah turns out I was wrong. I stand corrected.,GuildWars,cnquj6u,1,t5_2quyl

3436583,0,t3_2zjz15,If you enjoy deckbuilding Id suggest The Secret World buy to play an mmo set in the modern world.  You get an active and a passive deck.  Active deck depends on currently equipped weapons passives can come from any weapon and you can change your weapons at any time as long as you unlock them and purchase the corresponding abilities.  You can change your build at any time right out in the field as long as youre out of combat. Good explanation of the deck system if you want to read more about it Also if you enjoy stories and questing...it is light years ahead of all mmos in that department.  The games got warts but its worth a look imo.  And like GW the game can roll you pretty hard from the beginning even with the nerfs if you dont pay attention to your environs and simply herp derp your way through mobs with a terrible build.  Its not a game for some one who cant or dont want to adapt their builds. Someone who has a low tolerance for challenge and gets frustrated easily will wash out here.  TSW gives you a fair amount of freedom in terms of how you can build your character but the flip side of that is...if you want to shoot yourself in the foot with an all over the place nonsense build it will load the gun for you.I also second the suggestion for Path of Exile.  It surprised me in terms of quality.  I thought it would be like Torchlight instead it was something with much more depth.  The passive tree and weapon socketing system deal is insane.  I unfortunately didnt get deep into it due to being distracted with other games but as other have said you do have to have an eye for building for the long haul and it is a very fun well made game.

4049363,0,t3_36wwlw,You wont have a bad experience but you will miss some content reserved for native campaign characters.  Its possible to play all the campaigns on a single character so long as you have them unlocked on your account. The main reason people prefer Factions and Nightfall is because theyre a little faster paced in that they get you to level  more quickly than Prophecies.  Getting to level  is the tutorial its something that anyone can do given time and modest effort.  Heroes are preferred to Henchmen as well because you have much more control over their builds and their overall strategysynergy with your team. GW doesnt do a particularly good job of preparing players for GW the inverse is true too.  Your merits in GW really dont mean anything in GW.  Largely and moreover as difficult as it may be to believe GW is actually the more difficult and challenging game. Some minor advice I want to give Play cautiously until you know your limits  Use the wiki to avoid getting lost.  Always have energy management in your build.  Condition removal is helpful as well.  Learn how to play around your heroeshenchmen. Do not carelessly slot in runes or insignia to your armor.   Salvage everything and store it in your Xunlai Account.  Make sure your armor is uptodate.  Armor is crafted at Armor NPCs not dropped.  Joining a strong populated Guild is almost required to get your bearing as a new player. ,GuildWars,crhux7m,2,t5_2quyl

At around  a pop thats just under an hours wage in the UK if you can consistently farm point and gold during that hour to make up the ? Ish skills per hour then farming would be your desired route.,GuildWars,crlxkoz,1,t5_2quyl
4112783,0,t1_crp2qhr,The RitualistBy far more people use the Ritualist than any other profession to solo the UW. Shadowsong being able to blind is one of the best ways to defend against Aatxes Signet of Spirits creates a wall which you can use to bodyblock enemies to keep them away from you Painful Bond nearly doubles the damage of all your spirits and Armor of Unfeeling makes them take half damage. Summon Spirits allow you to heal and reposition your spirits and if one dies you can just summon it again.The Ritualist may be slower than the other builds posted above but it is by far the safest it has no extra requirements and it can clear the chamber safely and effectively by itself.You can easily play a second Ritualist with a modified build to maximize on Painful Bond and get the most out of your Attributes.When I get a group of people together I like to go into UW with many people who all want to solo farm  rits Assassins Rangers anything. The Rits clear the chamber while everyone else either helps out or waits. The Rits then go and farm Lab and the Vale.  person goes to farm Smites sometimes you need to escort them there everyone else runs through mountains and farms poolspitschaos plains. We can pop a BU as well if we need.The advantage to this is the cheaper entry fee and BU Essence of Celerity it lets you keep Shadow Form up without needing to bring extra skills to do it as well as extra drops. When youre solo you get x less drops than if there were  people but normally with  people you get drops reserved for one of you so it balances out. If youre split up your drops cant be reserved for anyone else and you get everything which drops in your area.I can give build templates for any of these but I prefer to do it in game because its easier to just copypaste them in chat there.,GuildWars,crp2zkw,4,t5_2quyl

4254657,0,t3_39ostw,Id advise against rit paragon monk and mesmer. As for rit and paragon theyre basically one build professions which are tedious builds but op builds at that. Furthermore the op rit build is called SoS and can be done on any other profession with rit as secondary so its  no point in making a rit.  The reason why I say not to be a monk is because if youre being a healer Im pretty sure that heroes or henchman are better. Mesmers can cast interrupts but again a computer controlled ai is better at timing them. Although if you find a monk  mesmer build that isnt based on healing or interrupts then I guess thats fine but Ive never played those proffs.It also depends on your starting campaign. Factions for assassin and rit Nightfall for Dervish and paragon and everything else is from Prophecies. The last thing is that this website has all meta builds so it may be worth looking at the meta builds and if you like them then pick that as your proff. ,GuildWars,cs57syw,-2,t5_2quyl

6669635,0,t3_470eeo,When dealing with the four man areas bar compression becomes important.First of all slot Save Yourselves! onto your bar. This will provide excellent damage reduction and free up precious room on your heroes.Secondly consider not bringing a dedicated healer. Two heroes with Ritualist primary or secondary should be able to keep your team alive provided you are able to keep SY! up properly. Look into the skills Mend Body and Soul Spirit Light and Protective Was Kaolai.Another way of staying alive is to not get hit at all. Bring Ritualist spirits and take some time to set them up before a fight. Careful pulling into a spirit wall is an effective strategy but beware of aoe damage wiping all your spirits! These spirits will of course serve another purpose which brings me to my next pointBuild your damage around your existing strengths. If you are playing as a Warrior take Splinter Weapon! Are you bringing a Necromancer hero? Micromanage Mark of Pain on your targets!Tldr Have your heroes serve multiple roles employ proper pve tactics and play to your strengths.

7026032,0,t3_4btokg,TLDR.   The guide to fast HoM stuff is to the right of this thread.GW is a truly magical game.  It is like no other then or now.  There is no way to know if you will be beguiled and entranced as many of us are unless you try it.  Presearing Prophecies welcoming area is a flawless and wonderful introduction to GW.  The only way for you to know is to buy the games and be born into Prophecies.I recommend Proph because that is the way the game developed and it is good to follow the flow ... Of course you can opt for Quick and Fast if what you want is to hurry up and finish but that wont give you the real GW experience.  Or you can opt for the GetMyHeroesNow choice ... but again. .. that is not the GW flow.  Still many good players recommend that course.It depends on what you want out of GW.  GW is enormous.  I dont mean that in terms of size of maps tho thats big too but in terms of titles and skills and professions and seconds.  It takes most players years to earn GWAMM.  Most! tho there are some amazing players here who earn that ultimate title in what seems like minutes.You will absolutely miss out on a great deal unless you own all  campaigns and the Eye of the North expansion.Your last question about drawbacks  I assume from this that you want your HoM stuff ... your Heritage this and that quickly and without the hassle of earning them the oldfashioned way.  In that I cannot help you at all.  But there is a guide see the title in the panel to the right of this thread.This is an active Reddit for GW which should let you know the game is alive and well.  In no way is GW a ghost town.  There are fewer players than in  certainly.  But it is the rare outpost where there is not at least one group there.  If you do decide to join up find a guild many recruit in the busy towns of Kamadan and Presearing and Lions Arch and are friendly to newcomers and HoM seekers.  Many will help you with missions and such.  Make Wiki your very best friend so you understand the basic game.GW is nothing like GW.  And btw its GW ... not GW.    GL to you.

7151353,0,t3_4d6dny,Assassin and Ritualist get my vote.PvE is owned by melee DPS and as many buffs as possible. The only PvE only buff which heroes cant bring is amazing Great Dwarf Weapon. Any profession can use it but it lasts longer with Spawning Power and Ritualist is a strong profession in its own right with Signet of Spirits Vampirism and Summon Spirits.Assassin can dish out some of the highest DPS by itself and its only increased more by your allies. If youre not sold on Ritualist if you want to start Nightfall for Dervish you can go Necromancer for Weaken Armor Barbs and Mark of Pain. Necromancers also get Order of Pain but its not worth bringing to buff just one person.Build varietywise Assassin or any melee profession will be stuck in melee DPS Necromancer will be stuck in Curses but has the freedom of any Elite from it or Soul Reaping the buff skills dont dictate the build much. Ritualist as the highest freedom being able to run any build as long as it has GDW.I guess this is more focused on synergy than the others but Smite Monk is also viable if you think you wont get bored of it or its alternate options instantly Strength of Honour being another buff of course which is extremely potent.,GuildWars,d1r1ch3,1,t5_2quyl

8353340,0,t1_d5lhbge,Oh I should have worded it better. I like ST a lot I just didnt agree with the other skills Zway uses in conjunction with it. As for your link its basically the same concept as  hero player support with only minor variants for melee characters so it will definitely work. The only thing I would change is dropping one of the healers or the ST Rit and replace it with a minion bomber or SOGM Rit. You shouldnt need  healers an ST and a hybrid smiter to keep your party alive. If you do have too much healing and not enough damage stuff wont die as quickly and you can get overwhelmed easier if there are large groups.

10490371,0,t3_5q7ja4,Pretty sure the Ritualist was Guild Wars version of an engineer archetype from other games. Theyve stated this before they went to GW iirc. They did such a great job for Ritualists though both aesthetic and mechanic wise. Maybe for Paragon they wanted a tanky party buffer? Im guessing theyre meant to be oneofakind leaders because shouts dont stack. I cant think of another games equivalent currently. Im pretty sure Paragons are based on GrecoRoman spearpilum throwers. More Greek than Roman if you ask me. Their armor reminds me of Greek Hoplites. Add in a little angelic themes too like the spear of destiny and that some angels are depicted wearing ancient GreekRoman armor. In my opinion most unique is the Mesmer.
