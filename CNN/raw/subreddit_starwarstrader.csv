3665801,0,t3_3293cp,Oh people are awful.  I pulled two of the new TC card today which was great because Ive had awful luck this past week so I figured I could trade away the dupe for a different insert.  I specifically stated what I was looking for in the feed and was keeping an eye out for people looking for the card as well in case they had it.  The offers I got were the worst.  of them didnt even come close to following the instructions I posted although clearly they read them because that was how they had access to my profile to trade and they were grossly unfair.  My favourite was one for three yellows that I already had.  Yeah that happened.  Eventually I got two decent offers that were fair and chose the one that was offering what I explicitly stated I wanted.  The other was perfectly fair but not something I really wanted so I gave five stars anyway.And this is now my typical experience trading.  People are seldom willing to make even trades anymore and most others will try and scam you out of good cards.Im usually fairly generous with newbies because they have it rough now but while sometimes they will be gracious and just accept it other times they try and take advantage either trying to get more free cards or trying to get more than a generous deal thinking they can extort me.  I remember I offered on a yellow card I needed.  I dont remember exactly what I offered as I have so many trades and offers per day but it was more than  and they came back at me with a demand for  yellows in their favour.  Needless to say I declined and made no further attempts to trade with such an unreasonable person.  Does no one value fair trading anymore?  And people are so rude.  Sigh.,starwarstrader,cqa4jsr,2,t5_37ffd

The movies were shot in  or roughly that and meant to be viewed that way. Topps would be very limited in their selection of cards to release if they had to crop movie scenes to a portrait mode that were never meant to be viewed that way.A cool solution might be to create a feature within the card that would allow one to swipe the image from left to right within the frame of the card to reveal the entire scene. ,starwarstrader,cqdk3za,1,t5_37ffd

Maybe not quite up there with the RED Hooded Padme and that EXTRA Red Yoda go look there is ONE more Yoda in the RED set that looks VERY similar to the original lightsaberwielding version but still tough to pick up nonetheless.  I also see a lot of requests for the ObiWan Spirit Yellow.Making things even more difficult for me is that I decided very early on that I wanted the Luke Jedi Knight card to be MY goto card the one I would HOARDCOLLECT etc.Its taken me nearly  and a half weeks of constant trade requests pushing and pulling but I finally nabbed a Yellow Luke the other day.  Lord knows how hard it will be for me to get a GOLD Luke Jedi Knight.  I really havent been tracking those much but I am hoping I can score one eventually.  I have a GREEN Luke Jedi and Rebel Commander Ive managed to pick up from other trades but no ORANGE or PURPLE as yet.

This is more the kind of response I expected and seem to get when considering trades of this nature.For the record I DO have the entire original set and it mystifies me when I see just the Amethyst in some traders collection on its own like its some sort of Shred trophy card.  I pulled a Blue about  or  packs in and couldnt believe it when it appeared.  However despite spending some serious credits I just couldnt seem to pull the Normal.  So I ended up trading for the Normal and got it something like  hours before the deadline.  Had to be very patient to get it despite knowing there were a LOT of Normals out there. PI also had to give up some crazy cards to get it something like a Vader GM and two recent at the time WVs.However like you Im pretty content that Ive got it.  Its doubtful I would give it up now despite the idea of exchanging it for megacards.  I think that is a dream long passed LOL !For example I tried yesterday to orchestrate a deal for the set trading for Ralph GM  to someone who just plain didnt have Windu at all or at least the Amethyst.  But nobody was biting.  Not sure that trading for even  or  Vintages would be worth it now actually.  Or even a Commemorative Set. But to be sure I WOULD have traded it for a couple of Vintages amp Ralph had someone been open to it.  Ah well.  Its nice to dream...,starwarstrader,crl8wlk,2,t5_37ffd

4285107,0,t3_3a28tw, What is your opinion on selling cards on eBay and if you are against it are you saying that these digital cards hold no monetary value just personalemotional value? Any chance on more locks becoming available there are more and more cards being released every day and its becoming a hassle dealing with players offering me constant horrible trades for valued cards. What has been your favorite set released to date? Whats your reasoning behind variants? Im sure you have noticed but the majority of players do not enjoy getting the same card with just a different color. e.g. Red Maul Blue New Hope. Somewhat related to question above... Many card collectors consider variants as holographic in which case theyre much more sought after because  they are rarer and  they simply stand out. Any chance of that coming here? Maybe animated cards check out that badass Wampa attack!,starwarstrader,cs8nh5o,3,t5_37ffd

4345006,0,t1_csf5teb,True but he didnt have to be a jerk about it.  Often people in the FF will not be specific about what they want and then get angry when they dislike the offer even if it is fair.  And really how can anyone be expected to read the intentions of another?  I cannot know who is collecting oranges for a chase and who is simply pulling dupes.  I cannot know who is collecting a set based on their cards as they may simply not have acquired it yet or they may intend to trade it unless they have offered a very specific trade request in the FF.  This guy just sounds like a jerk.A little anecdote of my ownI offered someone I trade they didnt like apparently and they sent me a rude comment.  I replied that their rudeness was entirely unnecessary and was about to block them and leave it at that but then they swore at me in a very er descriptive and offensive manner.   Normally I dont care about swearing too much even if it is against the rules but that was really quite beyond what I can be expected to tolerate.  I hope they enjoy their suspension.  It was if you are wondering someone offering a trade without specifying what they wanted and getting angry when I did not read their mind and give what they desired.  It was also imo a fair deal from what I recall.  I expect they wanted overpay.  Idc  they are on the ignore list forever now.,starwarstrader,csfewev,2,t5_37ffd

4744149,0,t1_ctsj0s0,Excellent point. The way Topps changed how the fantasy game works for BUNT in  coupled with the premium cost to acquire gold card eligible packs both have actually made Gold  Super Rares worth something on their own again.I also agree that there could be some sort of game aspect introduced to SWCT that would make the app more relevant beyond collectingaccumulatinghoarding. The fan base of Star Wars seems to be vastly greater than that of any of the individual sports apps.  The sports apps can at least have different angles of attack for appeal between collecting and fantasy game playing. SWCT really needs some added dimension as the singlepurpose to collect and hoard inevitably goes stale for some. When TFA comes out that is likely to inject some renewed frenzy for SWCT but not sure how long of a sustained boost that will prove to be.,starwarstrader,ctsjmfo,2,t5_37ffd

4821550,0,t3_3gx5y8,My quick response. Use the checklist mode to view your collection if you want card names. Also scroll back through the transmissions till you see the card youre looking for.  Follow swctinfo on Twitter and browse her images.. Most dont have numbers built in. But you can try the Insert Set Info link on the sidebar here.  Lots of good stuff in the sidebar beyond that.. FA cards were in base packs for a while and they also were releasing FA flash packs here and there but they havent done so in a while.. This should spark the most variety of answers as value is highly subjective.. If you avoid spending any credits for a full  days you will have . Add to that a healthy amount of tapjoy and youll be able to pull something. But being able to hold off spending credits for seven days is another story.  I highly recommend it though.  Some people including myself have multiple accounts too.. See number . But the best way to grow your collection is by trading.  At first youll end up making some bad trades some will take advantage of you but here and there youll nail one and itll feel great.  Just take the bad trades as a lesson and use the Trade Advice Thread at the top of this page.  Send  offers to users with star ratings or experienced players you meet on here to ask advice if you have a big trade pending.  But once you get some inserts using my advice in  trade trade trade trade trade.,starwarstrader,cu2ao1t,5,t5_37ffd

Your comment has some up votes so it looks like this is kind of a popular thought.  I would love to hear peoples theories on this.Please also bear in mind I am just genuinely curious.

I think you can hold that grudge against Jabba the Hutt the rest of us can continue using words that are true to their definition.. I would argue that the worst thing that ever happened in Star Wars to women was Oona also a slave being executed by being fed to a Rancor and the act being spectated by Jabbas court much like a sport. That or Shmi the slave being beaten and worse to death by the sandpeople. I might agree with you that the portrayal of women in slavery in the Star Wars movies was the worst thing about the series except that we arent that good in preventing it here in the real world.

5122300,0,t3_3l55wr,I dont disagree with the point that it is sometimes fair to offer  yellows. Even the people that are telling you how awful it is I have a hard time believing any of them would have traded their Gold Amidala Greedo Varactyl Opee during the Smugglers Den turnin  for another gold. Cards have boosts in value at specific times. We see this in real life too. If you want the newest iPhone the day it comes out youre going to pay far more for it than if you wait until the next iPhone model is released. If you want this years newest car model youre going to pay more for it now than if you wait until next year. Going after the newest best and brightest shiny thing the minute it is released always forces people to pay a premium. Pretending this doesnt happen is naive silly andor ignorant. The releases in SWCT just happen on a faster timetable. That being said I think using Ebays sold listings to prove your point is nonsensical. First of all the prices of regular inserts vary wildly. Just yesterday I was trying to figure out the value of some of the Bounty cards I had. Both Sugi and Onca had about  sold listings that were pretty similar  in the . range. But there were also several that sold for . and one that sold for .! Second yellow cards are not the same as Inserts. Yes their value has been increased by the introduction of variant cards but nobody opens packs to get yellows. People open packs to get inserts. They are a byproduct. One yellow is not inherently more valuable than another like you see with inserts would anyone trade this weeks Vintage for this weeks Fans Choice? No!. This is why people dislike the practice. Yellow cards SHOULD be equally valuable. Id argue that they are actually equally valuable. The reason why some people are willing to pay more is because they are afraid of not having enough when their favorite cards are available for Smugglers Den and because they have so many of them that they are essentially valueless in their mind.,starwarstrader,cv3fge5,3,t5_37ffd

5336143,0,t3_3o17c3,There are plenty of packs that have  odds.  Even if you were guaranteed an insert it would be roughly  odds in a  credit pack for a card you dont necessarily want.  I dont understand the benefit of this.The old Star Destroyer packs were  and while a guarantee wasnt guaranteed it worked out to roughly  in a pack on average.  That meant that you were essentially getting  odds for a random card at  per pull.  It made it worth it to throw extra credits at something because it was just extra trade garbage.Topps has gotten really weird with its deals lately.  Between this the lock pack the guaranteed white card pack the schematic packs....their deals are worse than just trying your luck.,starwarstrader,cvtr279,1,t5_37ffd

5429555,0,t1_cw5j250,The thing that would make this better all round is communication.  They could easily have put up a message yesterday to say no GM today so those who were collecting would know and could spend their money on other things or just not bother logging in today if they chose.This app is designed to make you log in many times a day and to always be ready for a random drop which is fun for a while but eventually becomes boring and will start to lose people as real life gets in the way and we cant all sit around waiting for Topps to drop something that we may like.Ive said before Im a comic collector.  Ask any comic shop owner and they will tell you that the single biggest thing to kill off any sales of a comic is irregular scheduling when the customer doesnt know when the next issue will be available.  Even the hottest titles have seen sales drop drastically as people move onto other things when they are left hanging. Now its not exactly the same with this app but one thing I thought Topps got really right from the start was the marathons.  Daily you know there would be at least one series to collect roughly when it would drop and could plan your credits accordingly.  Im fairly certain something similar will be announced and Vintage luke prepares aside is the text book for a great series that had and kept a lot of buzz going over  weeks.  More of that please and better comms.,starwarstrader,cw5oje6,5,t5_37ffd

5715055,0,t1_cx5i1if,Using your example if the odds on one card are  then the odds of getting a particular card remain at  but the odds of getting any one of the three improve to .So if youre opening packs until you get the latest of the three the fact that you got one or more copies of the other two along the way isnt hurting you its just adding to your trading stock.Of course if you wanted to you could stop after you got one of the older ones and try to trade that one for the new one you want instead.You say this is a source of debate but to be frank its not. Almost every experienced player will agree with me on this and tell you that what you believe is wrong. With all due respect when  players out of  agree on something its not much of a debate is it?As to why the cards lasted so long in packs well the answer is simple its a combination of the fact that there arent  people chasing the gray Space Painting variants and some more savvy chasers waiting until the doubledip benefits them the most before opening extra packs.This topic has been discussed so many times before but basically if Im after orange and gray Space Paintings and I have found todays orange but not todays gray then if Im confident that the grays will still be there tomorrow it is smarter for me to stop opening more packs today. I can then open packs tomorrow and go after todays gray plus tomorrows orange and gray cards at the same time. Which would you rather do spend credits chasing one insert you need today or spend the same amount of credits chasing the same amount of credits simultaneously chasing that insert plus two other inserts you need tomorrow?Look you dont have to take my advice here. Youre free to do whatever you wish. I just think you are missing out on something here and Im trying to help you see how and why youre missing out unnecessarily right now.,starwarstrader,cx5ib4w,1,t5_37ffd

5857542,0,t1_cxnfwcn,I think the honest answer as to why they are doing the gambling aspect is twofold  The  price point was established as working... through midway bluegreen saber.  So if it aint broke dont fix it.  Combine that with  There is a  cap for the credit purchases.  So if a  is selling out at  ideally theyd like to offer a  at ... but they cant.  Therefore they just some maths and go ok so well do it based on odds and get a blended price where the  is higher than .That all said  is now the choking point.  They cant move the  at that.  s?  Yeah theyd probably do ok.  So HOPEFULLY what well see is less of this  for everything and see them more realistically do  for a  set  for a  set and so on.  And of course readjust as demand is or isnt met.  They need to start listening to the market.Hoping the increase in chance for a purple is just that.  That said I STILL think the price point is too high for these given s around the corner.  I assume well see a  price for these tonight or tomorrow.  If that doesnt move them well get the  deal.Like it or not there is a price where people will buy them.  They just need to get off their butts and find it.,starwarstrader,cxngaib,1,t5_37ffd

Some sort of escrow service to moderate trades is the only thing I can think of that would work.  But as of now the digital card secondary marketplace simply isnt large enough to justify the cost outlay that would likely take.Heck with Topps banning people for whatever reason they choose any escrow service type opportunity would require them to signoff on it yeah right! or would need an insurance policy just in case the account got banned middelivery.,starwarstrader,cy6xvot,1,t5_37ffd

I watched the movies a LOT as a kid so this was a fun metagame to play while watching for the Nth time. To that end IG has always been a favorite of mine at least aesthetically theres not much else to him in the movies and I really enjoyed his EU stories although notsomuch his fanservicey end at the hands of toocoolforschool Boba Fett.

6312201,0,t1_cz749uy,Almost  cards have sold out early is before the stated card count was reachedsince the start of the app.One reason for this is that the set wasnt popular enough to sell out.  Some sets they leave the packs in Master access until all the inserts sell out and others they pull the packs early and after a variable amount of time mark those inserts as sold out.Another reason is that a device crashed before informing the server that it successfully opened the cardIn most cases cards only sell out  card early.  Originally it was thought this card was used for testing and they would have Topps employees testing the pull mechanism until  was pulled but that one would be removed from circulation.  I dont think this is the case.  Some cards sell out a lot more than  early!In one case a card sold out at  instead of  and ToppsJer had to create a nd copy of the card with a cc of  because a sold out card cant be opened  Maybe this only applies to limited count cards because unlimited count cards have definitely been sold out and reopened in the past in multiple cases.Related Cards that are not sold out vs cards that are pullable,starwarstrader,cz74ksy,2,t5_37ffd

Just doesnt seem like theres any reason for Topps to care if the count on these goes up. Theres no real logic to how many get shredded and no reason those counts have to be supressed. If some are as common as a purple preview so be it. The pink shreds last year were an entirely different animal since they were limited to . If they sold out in seconds then Topps had no reason NOT to up the gold count required. But these are openended. The more people engaged in the chase the bigger a success it is Id think.Though my hope that Topps is actually consistent about something like this might just be setting myself up for disappointment.,starwarstrader,d09elto,1,t5_37ffd

Probably was one of those. First few days I was kind of ignorant about the packs probably couldve started off better if I didnt buy so may of those Boba Fett packs. There was a cool user who sent me  several inserts early on and thats still a huge chunk of my inserts.  One thing I miss from the early days of me joining was the  credits when completing a set.

Then I stumbled across a trade that landed me the Slave  WV award. Another trade landed me the Father and Son WV award. So I figured that I should try and complete the whole set to get the BIG award. Almost a week later and I am  cards shy of the set. Th one that eludes me is Goodbye for obvious reasons.

8061740,0,t1_d4m51uw,You make a fair point.  The card he cornered became more valuable giving him leverage in trades and auction sales. But to what extent did he capitalize on that opportunity?  I honestly dont know the answer to that but if I were in his position I wouldnt want to be left holding so many copies of a card from a dead set after the award has dropped. I still think it is debatable as to whether this approach to manipulating the market was a sound strategy or if it was worth his initial investment of resources.  I should also point out that Im not suggesting every move a trader makes has to have a net profit.  None of the cards I have cornered ever saw any appreciable increase in value and if they had I wouldnt have capitalized on it.  I am assessing this particular strategy in these terms because it seems to be the motivation behind the play.

8378924,0,t3_4uda0u,Maybe Prime as a set isnt x as desirable as WV as a set but it is significantly more desirable better design better images lower count. Then consider the specifics of these two cards. Rey Prime has high value to legions of Rey or BB fans who arent even trying to chase Prime. FO WV only has value to people trying to chase WV. Probably also there is somewhat of a discount when you are trading multiple of the same card. That is only going to appeal to people who like trading vs collecting and trade for long term value. For someone like me it would just seem like getting a chore in exchange for their desirable card.So it doesnt seem all that crazy to me.

8819797,0,t3_50vu59,Dumbest. Idea. Ever.If anything it makes me want to trade with that person far less because of the ridiculousness of it. Appeals only to young kids and those that are pretty damn stupid.To me its a juvenile thing and screams out that people involved in this are more interested in having their names on some list instead of having fun and making good fair trades.There is absolutely ZERO need for any kind of having to trust within the app itself. Someone sends you a trade you check it out you click one of the options. Thats it. I personally check every single trade whether its the first time I traded with someone or the hundredth time. If for no other reason than people can make mistakes myself included. Ive caught my own errors before hitting send by doing that and Ive caught either people scamming or making a mistake. Its not a lot of brain work involved and I dont need a list to do these things. Its a Look at me. I have my name on a list! mentality which is downright silly.And to top it off who the heck would want to put their name as a reference for anyone else in this game?

I have had personal contact with Topps as recent as  weeks ago over cross trading.  I reported a scammer from SLAM amp SWCT.  I finally was burned not badly but enough to report the offender with screen shots.  Topps responded that action was taken against the scammer and they included tips on how to protect yourself from scammers.  They included communication on both apps watching out for low trader ratings and low star ratings as warning signs.  They did not say it was against the rules.  They actually gave tipsadvice on how to better safe guard against scammers on Xtrades.  As much as I dont agree with Topps handling of issues I find it hard to believe that they would give me advice to protect against scammers while suspendingbanning others for the same action.The problem with internet quotes is that you cant always depend on their accuracy Abraham Lincoln ,starwarstrader,d96uu7j,4,t5_37ffd
