The title is spoiler free. My question was why RISK being spoiled by going on a social media site? And the second part of that sentence is another jab at this subreddit. which you claim not to do gt i stay subbed just because of the TTTTTSMMMMMMMM spam threads and the Dyrus AMA and for some positive threads that go to first link the majority is a cesspool.So you stay subbed for one of the things you said could spoil the result in an earlier post. And there we go with another jab at the whole subreddit!  gt Yeah sorry if i dont go on euw esportswhat the.... this makes such little sense I dont even know what to say back. Did you assume the League of Legends Esports website was only for Europe?  gt not like you guys cant put a massive spoiler in the titleshow me the spoiler. Right there is none.
