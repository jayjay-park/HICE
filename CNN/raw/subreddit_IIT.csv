9389655,0,t1_d966qzh,I had to take HIST  for my major and wasnt really something I was interested in even though some of the topics brought up and some activities and discussions we had in class happened to be very interesting. So if youre actually interested in the topic I say go for it. For SS Gen Eds you have to take a  lower level classes and one upper level class of the same subject as one of the lower classes from what I understand. For example if you take and PSYCH  and a PS  then you can take an upperlevel of EITHER PSYCH or PS. Youre gonna have to ask your advisor about this to make sure this is how it works but Im fairly certain this is it.In that case I havent taken any of the upperlevel courses offered for any of the social sciences except for a PS  class two years ago with an adjunct professor who no longer works here.,IIT,d967e36,1,t5_2soxs
