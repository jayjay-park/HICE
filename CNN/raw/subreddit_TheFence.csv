912980,0,t3_22zels,Ive scoured the internet for things that scratch my Coheed itch and Ive found some pretty nice stuff on bandcamp. Theres some definite variation in quality and I dont think any of these have vocals similar to Claudios but I figured Id share what I have. Sios  Conceptual pretty solid. Now defunct. The former lead singer has a similarsounding solo project called the Lunar Kai that hes getting started since the breakup but I dont have a link to that at the moment. The Calefaction  Rough production iffy vocals but not too bad. The guitars are what do it for me. The titles of the EPs suggest something conceptual but I cant discern anything from the lyrics the support that. To Give You the Stars  Conceptual plays it up with some recurring motifs also. Probably the most directly Coheedinspired but not necessarily the closestsounding. The Ghost Word Conceptual but almost exclusively acoustic. Probably my favorite of all of these. The vocals are a little different but obviously Claudioinspired and the whole project sounds a little like acoustic Coheed demos from the early days. This is a side project for the creator whose main project is Fireflies which is more of the same kind of material without the story behind it.As an aside this is my first post on reddit so hopefully I got all of the formatting right and posted this in a proper thread.

5266551,0,t1_cvkni5k,I know nothing technical about playing any string instrument but from the ear and eyeball test I think the fact that Mic started as a guitar player who picked up bass specifically for Coheed shines through in what he did with Coheed in an amazing kind of way.It sounded and looked from watching his hands in live shows and whatnot like he jumped around the range quite a bit when he played without being chaotic and unlistenable which is kind of a Claudio trademark on rhythm guitar and solos.  He also seemed to play on the higher end of the time signature.  More ths and ths than quarters and whatnot.  Zach seems to play more in runs.  Hell work his way up and down his range incrementally instead of jumping a lot which he can also do.  He kinda cocreates a pocket and stays in it where Mic let Josh create the pocket and then he kinda explored the edges of it.  Zach definitely has the ability to play the faster notes and whatnot but I think he understands that sometimes the right eighth rests and running to the top of the key at certain times and working with the drummer can create a pretty awesome sound.  But again I know nothing technical about playing any string instrument so I could be  wrong.  ,TheFence,cvkuznu,6,t5_2xha1

5434685,0,t1_cw61bpb,Yeah. I can agree on that. Clunky certainly wasnt the right word but at the time I wrote it thats just want came out. Outdated I think is the stronger point because I didnt get into Coheed until GAIBS as I found out about them from ATV Offroad Fury mistaking Claudio for a woman from only having heard A Favor House Atlantic. When I did look them up the majority of things I found were from Good Apollo so thats where I started and thats the album that got me hooked. I didnt even really listen to SSTB other than Devil in Jersey City until much later and once I actually gave it the proper amount of time I just didnt want to listen to anything else. But now that Ive listened to all of the albums its kind of hard for me to go backwards. I got hooked on the Afterman albums almost immediately mostly because I was really interested in hearing the story of Sirius Amory and exploring the Keywork and once I was hooked I practically stopped listening to In Keeping Secrets which was probably my favorite album up until that point. As I said each album has held a different point in my attention but eventually I even out to In Keeping Secrects Good Apollo and typically whatever was the most recent. I can definitely agree that YOTBR was nothing like I was expecting which in its own way is kind of disappointing because thats been the only time Ive gotten to see them in concert and I spent  on the special album bundle they had but I feel that was worth it because I loved the book. I was kind of hoping Claudio was going to proceed with a novelized version of each section of the comics but I havent heard anything other than him thinking about it but I also havent looked so I may be misinformed there. Admittedly though I did like the kind of heavier sound YOTBR had I just wish it had a better flow in it.,TheFence,cw6c35h,1,t5_2xha1

5650018,0,t3_3sgni1,I have never understood the negativity towards those albums either. Granted it seems like not nearly as many people dislike NWFT as compared to YOTBR it genuinely surprised me how many disliked either or both of them. Before I found this sub really the only online coheed related community I have reached out to I had no idea that YOTBR was even commonly disliked among fans let alone NWFT. No World for Tomorrow is the album that took my opinion of coheed from Coolgoofy band with the high pitched singer I see on MTV to actually being a band I had interest inthat I wanted to discover more of. Before I got too deep into their stuff my taste in music shifted towards heavier stuff for a few years then to hip hop and rap through highschool and a short lived dubstepedm phase. Then one day I felt like jamming out to some good ol childhood tunes and thought about the Suffering music video looked up Coheed on Spotify and noticed they had two new albums out Afterman which I got absolutely hooked on and that was the birth of my Coheed obsession. Ill admit YOTBR is different and I totally understand why people can see it was the weakest of their material but what baffles me is how some people claim to actually hate it. I mean sure it lacks a certain... vibe that other coheed albums have but I think it holds its own and has more than a few awesome songs. ,TheFence,cwxfu6w,1,t5_2xha1

8501029,0,t3_4w5izz,I mean excluding other Coheedadjacent bands Thank You Scientist  Davenport Cabinet etc Id say the albums that give me the most Coheedlike feelings are   Kezia by Protest the Hero   Tech post hardcore melodic Supporting Caste by Propagandhi   Similar to Protest and actually one of their biggest influences. A little more muscle and a little less flash.  Sound of Perseverance by Death  This is death metal thats very technical but very musical.  Coral Throne by Mandroid Echostar  Very similar to Coheed but less of the punk influence and more prog rock. Bat Out of Hell by Meat Loaf  Melodramatic theatrical rock and roll with powerful vocals and enough cheese for the whole family.  The Low End Theory by A Tribe Called Quest  Great eastcoast hip hop. Everyone should have at least one album by Quest in their collection.  Rodrigo y Gabriela selftitled  Technical beautiful and just a treat sonically.  A Passion Play by Jethro Tull  Big complicated prog rock these guys have more than one album length song this is just the one Im most enamored with. Thick as a Brick is the other oneand Aqualung is probably the most well known of their albums. I love this band to death so its tough to pick just one. Rock  tha Rhythm by Just Friends  Anthemic powerful and over the top. Its hard to explain the lead singer can put some people off because passion overrides his quest for note accuracy but this is what a house show feels like. This is the band I take friends to who say they dont like concerts they change everything. Its like a band you already know the words to every song and sing along with without ever having been to a show or heard their music.I dont think any band besides these guys Coheed and Girl Guts have ever made me feel like that. Obviously theres so much about Coheed to like poppy choruses great guitar work proggy breakdowns great cleanunclean vocals focus on musicality over technicality without falling into too many traps of radio rock we all get into it for different reasons. The punkposthardcore influence has always been a big factor in what makes their songs sound so urgent and intense their love for Iron Maiden and s rock is kinda what brings the technicalityprog elements and that special splash of pop music prowess that Claudio seems to make even songs about murdering your exwife a singalong which is not an easy feat. edits for explanation and spelling fixes. ,TheFence,d646jdp,35,t5_2xha1

Its not like when Metallica does a cover of something thats not hard rockmetal and while it sounds good you cant help but feel like it sounds a bit out of place for them.CampC just has a really well done flexible sound thats totally versatile enough to step into pretty much any genre similar to any of the songs theyve done.,TheFence,d6va6xn,1,t5_2xha1

8933466,0,t1_d7lh1c3,I agree. DONT do it at the show. Its a Coheed concert for their fans not your personal stage. Thats almost equivalent to those idiots who block traffic on a major highway for proposals. Do it in private and wait until after the show. No one else at the concert cares about your relationship. Think about the other concert goers. They paid money to see Coheed and Cambria not some random persons wedding proposal. Its not a good idea to make a big public spectacle for your gf to say yes. It wouldnt be fair to put her on the spot like that in front of hundredsthousands of people. A cool idea that would involve the band without disturbing the audience would be after the show if you can get them to autograph a poster and write something like Will you marry me? instead of actually signing it then give her the poster.
