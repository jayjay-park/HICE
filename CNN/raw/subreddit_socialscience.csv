6325682,0,t3_426fdy,Our western society holds the individual as sacred. That is one of the worst things one can do is to fail to acknowledge someone else or to use other people as means to some end.Our rituals are based on this. We gotta greet and say good bye we gotta make eye contact we gotta say excuse me and sorry. Doing otherwise can result of sanctions of a sort. If you routinely fail to do all those people will dislike you and exclude you. If you do them all correctly you will succeed socially. Think of a person who isnt only polite but also smiles and shows interest in and undivided attention to the people they speak to they acknowledge the other as an individual. Thats the kind of person who becomes popular.People say excuse me when blocking your view not because of any independent inner need for validation but because they are socialised to do so. That woman probably didnt think twice or once about it.,socialscience,cz8ntkk,4,t5_2r643
