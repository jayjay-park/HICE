6090100,0,t3_3yylsl,I would swap out nefarian for tirion fordring if you have it since there are enought dragons in the deck to. Cost one less mana survives longer since it stays out of the sights of big game hunter you get the ashbringer once your opponent finally gets through it and even if they silence it its still a . I may just be biased because I im tired of RNGesus giving me two bunk spell cards off nefarians battlecry. ,Hearthstones,cyhvq1w,1,t5_3903g
6770638,0,t3_48eq0w,If you just want heal the class specific heals are more manaefficient because hp for  mana is just bad and it can also be removed with minion removal. For the classes who dont have any heals Farseer is good enough. The only role Bolf fills IMO is malygos shaman counter lol.,Hearthstones,d0jqe9i,1,t5_3903g

8715638,0,t1_d6uzox1,I think keeper of uldaman is pretty useful against control! since control usually has big guys. Also if your opponent does not have a minion it becomes a  mana  give  to a silver hand recruit. Still good the opponent must deal wth it. Peacekeeper is really not so good vs. control however... late game minions lots of times are a problem because of their abilities not their attack. It doesnt matter if you change an Antonidas attack to  after all.The deathrattle theme is good and though Barnes  Doomsayer is a painfully bad synergy it works with the other things pretty well.Does Selfless Hero work though? Dont you end up not playing it turn one or suiciding it with some frequency?And is Twilight Summoner working wel?,Hearthstones,d6v3d19,1,t5_3903g
