2787716,0,t3_2rys4n,I thought Chez Apocalypse was a side project for Lindsay and her crew of hipster douchebags to produce videos without giving money to Channel Awesome probably a result after the whole Spoony debacle. From what I could tell this FAQ is her leaving Channel Awesome meaning that shes no longer obligated to make videos under the Channel Awesome name and make stuff on her own when she feels like it. Also I dont see any mention of Foldable Human leaving. ,KiAChatroom,cnkyc94,1,t5_34hik

2823149,0,t3_2sdm0w,I replied to a thread entitled Dear GamerGators and got banned for it. Hahahaha. Their viewpoints cannot hold up to scrutiny. The only defense those mods have is to ban hammer ANYBODY that steps out of line.EDIT Correction I wasnt banned there until I posted this.

2836301,0,t1_cnqhcnf,Yeah correcting people on the Internet totally works.

2846490,0,t1_cnrktco,gt i wonder what the overlap of KiA and PCMR is.Not to sound like an ass or a shill but personally Ive been curious about this as well.  I have a difficult time seeing where one movement ends and another begins especially on Twitter.An example off the top of my head is Metalgate as that was supposed to be the Metal communitys equivalent to Gamergate and I just fucking cringe at how we latched onto it to make it a thing.  The hashtag currently has  tweets and over half of the tweets for it include Gamergate  I understand that a lot of gamers may be metalheads but since that initial spike the hashtag has waned and is currently just above nonexistence.  The same could be said with PCMasterRace the spike in its usage is largely in tandem with GamergateHowever something to keep in mind is that this is only one metric Twitter.  The Topsy links I put up only quantify that particular social media website and its difficult to gauge the separation especially when theres already a fair amount of overlap even on reddit.,KiAChatroom,cnrn8ov,1,t5_34hik
2870220,0,t3_2szns7,Its not a jab at GG. At Destructoid Sterling made a name for himself for posting news stories that were done for pure humor. He was then called out by people because of his lack of taking journalism seriously. His reply on the matter was that he was a blogger and not a journalist. Since then hes kept that as part of his MO so that he can make jokes without actually reporting the news properly. He usually has the gamers best interests in mind up until Gamergate where hes clearly decided that gamers arent that important to him anymore. ,KiAChatroom,cnucfb8,10,t5_34hik

3062067,0,t3_2v6mt5,Amala Network is Randi Harpers organization that will soon be publishing a general purpose social media blocker program which is a much improved version of the ggautoblocker. The software is not specifically made to only block GamerGaters but the initial release will focus on doing just that. In addition to computing a blocklist like the old ggautoblocker it uses sophisticated heuristics semantic recognition and natural language processing to identify undesirables.The four minutes thing mentioned on Ghazi is to test and improve the blocker algorithms. You are shown two tweets side by side one written by a GamerGater confirmed by a human not the software and one unrelated. Youre asked to identify the GamerGater tweet. You are shown  pairs of tweets and then you are shown your score compared to the algorithm. I correctly identified  and the algorithm identified . Im told the goal is to increase the accuracy to at least  before release alpha release. Edit The public release is aiming for  or better.Yes the way it was advertised on Ghazi was a lame attempt to make some gullible people think there were clandestine operations going on similar to the Solution thing GamerGate did but reality is far less sinister and less interesting.Edit and update The software will be open source MIT and Im told  I havent personally seen the code provides a simple API so sites like Twitter Facebook Reddit etc can easily integrate it into their services. The idea is to totally transform social media sites and forums from public park spaces where everyone is free to interact with each other to a more gated and private system where you are if you chose so only able to interact with likeminded and similar people. Think of it like email spam filtering  once youve trained the system how to identify people and groups you wish to make invisible you wont ever see anything from them again.,KiAChatroom,cofdp8f,8,t5_34hik

3265843,0,t3_2xi8pp,Absolutely. I want different better games being made. I feel gaming as a storytelling medium has only scratched the surface of its potential. If you were to ask me there are I feel less than twenty games in the entire history of the medium that truly count as total works of art.I see a lot of potential in this industry and Im excited to be a part of it. I work for a small studio and our first release is looking at a crowdfunding launch next month and as excited as I am Im afraid. Im afraid that refusal to pander to a particular inclique is going to negatively impact our success and indirectly my ability to make art to move people. Im afraid because I see my higher ups making decisions based on GamerGate and taking exactly the wrong lessons from it. Im afraid that I will not be able to be myself and an artist  that in order to have the public support to make this art I will have to be a bland humorless corporate suit whose personality is subsumed into a reflection of market forces.I went in to this project as a mad auteur and as its progressed Ive made more and more sacrifices for the sake of marketability. Truth be told Im currently uncertain whether I will actually be anything like happy with the finished project. But goddamnit I want the right to try and I dont plan on kowtowing to a bunch of upper middle class hipsters in the process.,KiAChatroom,cp0j70y,2,t5_34hik
3293820,0,t1_cp3p51y,Yea I think it comes out of ignorance. A lot of GG supporters myself included havent had many actual interactions with trans people. It doesnt help when SRHButts Devi Ever or Wu paint trans people in such a negative light. I think the only way to get around it is exposure to normal trans people. I know a few have commented in proGG context. Ultimately you cant control how anyone apart from you acts or feels. The only recourse is patience and exposure. In my opinion one of SJWisms greatest failures is outright attacking or dismissing anyone that disagrees. ,KiAChatroom,cp3q01k,4,t5_34hik

In consistent moderation would be the death of the sub and cause in fighting in a bad way. Oh well.gtIf a discussion has merit it should exist.Never said otherwise but how do we define merit?

3549241,0,t3_30xagb,Rather telling that I heard about the backlash to his racist and antisemitic tweets before I heard about him succeeding Jon Stewart on The Daily Show..The jokes in his tweets are all pretty funny in my opinion and consistent with his style. The outrage machine keeps spinning and fueling the flames of internet outrage. Im curios who is doing the yelling now though. I suspect a portion of the critiqs to come from the US right who strongly support Israel but I think part of the fingerwagging and shaming is from the humorless  ultra leftist political correctness police.I also saw a tweet on TiA though defending Noah saying he cant be racist because he isnt white sigh.  No he isnt racist because his tweets werent racist. He was making jokes because hes a comedian,KiAChatroom,cpwu4ed,3,t5_34hik

4171659,0,t3_38k9dr,So what this basically tells us is  Gamergate rather efficiently wiped out at least  quarters of profit for Gawker. See this is the thing few understood when GG begun. When it was reported that Gawker had a  figure loss from GG most dismissed it as a drop in the bucket given Gawkers total valuation. But in truth we are not fighting a war over the gross or the total cash flow. We fight and win over the margins. And the margin of profits for most of these unethical publishers is so narrow as to be reasonably easy for consumers to have a measurable impact on it. ,KiAChatroom,crvryro,5,t5_34hik
