4023758,0,t3_36kax9,MPW doesnt like ikurasalmon eggs?! Damnit thats my favourite kind of caviar. Im going to pretend he never said that.As for this ep it was kind of hilarious and embarrassing that they all fucked up their eggs. How could that dimbulb NOT time her egg? In an EGG CHALLENGE. Set by MPW. Derrr.As for dude I cant remember his name yet  I dont like his cooking at all. Even the stuff hes done that the judges have praised has just felt boring and kind of s. And he screwed up in the same way as Irina Shayklookalike by concentrating on seemingly everything except the egg.And last bit of bitchiness from me who could have thought that broth was going to cook the shrimp? It had obviously from the set look of the top of it in the vessel been sitting off the heat for a good while  I mean to cook seafood like that youd pretty much have to pour it straight on as soon as it came off the heat no?,MasterchefAU,crexsqu,1,t5_2uhwl

5489348,0,t3_3k2cwb, I dont know why everyones so bothered about the Baby Mafia. Those three are people Id be happy to make friends with and look like the nicest people in the competition. Plus theyve had a lot of camera time since auditions and some have struggled to get seen more. I love how theyre trying not to make it look like a friendship pick yet Kate chooses Sam first up and Chris thinks that choosing Josh will tear the group. The standards were so low that cooking for Matt Preston was regarded so highly. Many people will say that the only places of the supermarket worth going to are the sides away from the aisles so this challenge sets a big problem right from the start. And I cant believe they actually threw a dud aisle in. Theyre doing a little flash into the future of the challenge? Great shot of Simon Thomson looking like hes daydreaming. And I  dont like Larissa Dubecki since I saw her in Iron Chef Australia but I cant remember why. The first time the MasterChef knife pull is done. Id be tempted to buy some hair spray and poison the judges if they say anything bad. The challenge has barely started and the blue team are already trying to prepare ways to moan about Kates captaining if they lose. They didnt mention which supermarket theyre in. Are they alright? Slight flashback for some of the products and packaging styles from  years ago that are no longer. Little indication of Easter eggs show this was filmed around MarchApril but then again theres Easter stuff around supermarkets all year. Lots of MasterChef logos around as well. I feel like theyve shown a bit too much supermarket time in this episode. Gary suggesting a smear showing how dated this is. I forgot how this show used to excessively recap a lot more than it does now. Aaron focus on your own team. Im getting a lot of mixed messages from him throughout. I wish the plates didnt have those vibrant red and blue rings on them. The cameras did enough filming so that no one would get confused. No introduction were just lead to believe the food critics have been sitting and daydreaming in the dining room this whole time. Red teams entree looks unappealing. Blue team looks pretty good but I find it funny that the food critics disapprove of silly little garnishes and the bacon. Bacons good in whatever state. You heard about some trouble about the blue teams entree Andre? HOW? No one has been in the dining room to hear criticism so your comment to make it sound interesting for TV doesnt make sense. The reds main also looks terrible depending on the angle you see it. Pretty sure every time chicken is cooked on the crown it doesnt end well. Lets hope the blue team can produce something better. Or what you really mean is if you can eat it it wins. This looks very grandmas tea party. I was expecting that comment to be a good thing Larissa. Happy memories? Sweetness? Simple? Did you have bad tea parties? Of course the chocolate tart wins its chocolate! Chocolate always wins in my opinion. Simon says that giving the result will be interesting. Even though this is just a little cooking reality show that you dont know how it will turn out and youre not going to be there when it happens? The contestants seemed to be talking about just winning the challenge and bypassing elimination most of the time instead of what they were cooking. Why does Matt Preston need an envelope cant he remember from last night? Trevor looks shocked to see one. The blue team looked like they did a good job even though it felt like negative messages were spread throughout the entire show.,MasterchefAU,cwdbcm3,1,t5_2uhwl

7547811,1,t1_d2zu7zg,Not sure how this ignorant of a comment could be upvoted. You can make any dish or anything else for that matter sound insignificant and ridiculous by reducing it down to its core elements and ignore everything else about it. Lol how can people love soccer so much? Grown men running around in shorts chasing a leather ball. His idea of covering it up was to express himself and convey something to the judges.

7871511,0,t3_4n44rl,Always enjoy these type of challenges but I think this is most loud and hyped street food challenge Ive seen. What peoplecontestants need to understand is that in these challenges where money decides the winner you have to understand a lot of the customers are Masterchef fans so they will always pay more and buy more than usual despite the quality of the food. It cant be bad but when Chloe said  great dishes instead of the  good dishes clearly that was a mistake and where they lost the challenge I knew pretty unless something went very wrong red team would probably win. And it was too late when they added the prawns. Im pretty sure Chloe will use her immunity pin I can barely recall a time when someone hasnt used it. Hoping Mimi and Matt will stay safe. ,MasterchefAU,d40tw9m,10,t5_2uhwl

This year is super lame Anastasia had  power honestly because she had no power over her own cook. Soooo boring. Teresa is one of the people who doesnt bother me so Im ok with her being back but she will probably be going home pretty soon since she sucks at time management. Look forward to next episode.
