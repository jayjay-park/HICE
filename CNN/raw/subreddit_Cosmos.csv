521854,0,t3_200idt,There was one quote that stuck out to me  Science gives us the ability to perceive what the senses cannot. Isnt this a basic fallacy of sensory perception itself? If we are humans we experience exist through human sensory functions which means we cannot possibly experience anything outside of our senses.

549997,1,t1_cg2s49w,I realize all of this but thats kinda my point I was told and even the pre show interviews with the panelists states explicitly the Goal of this new cosmos is to hit the target demographic which are Fox news viewers  They literally said that straight from Anns mouth.  So one would think they would have taken a softer approach and probably avoided the Obama inclusion.My point is that for trying to reach a certain demographic it seems that someone is sure trying to make sure that the target demographic tunes out before anything can be accomplished via the evil depictions of religious people in the show to the overuse of supernatural words like hell to the use of the religious rights most hated figure as the show opener.Im just wondering why a show about helping religious people understand science seems to be creating a wall and pushing most religious people away and at the same time somehow giving them the idea that this IS the evidence they need for a creator.

Tyson speaks with strong certainty about the facts that have become hardened by the process of the scientific method eg natural selection and gravity. He is honest about those that are more speculative eg multiverse. Furthermore the interplay of the theme to question the status quo of scientific thought eg Bruno Newton and the theme to stand on the shoulders of giants the latest progression through Faraday gt Maxwell gt Einstein seem to juxtapose each other  yet elegantly weave themselves into a sort of evolution of human understanding that in time becomes immortalized.

719916,0,t1_cgk3lrs,You could have used the scene from the final episode Who Speaks For Earth? where SPOILERS Dr Sagan investigates a world whose dominant sentient civilization had destroyed itself with nuclear war ... and then upon returning to Earth learns that humans had done the same thing.There is a sense of urgency regarding selfdestruction that resonates through the original Cosmos  sometimes subtle and simple like in the first episodes and sometimes direct and painful as seen in the final episode  that exists on a much quieter scale in the series of today.  I do not think this is a reflection of our civilizations movement away from selfdestructive tendencies nuclear arms technology and weapon density per capable country are still staggeringly high remnants of the Cold War still haunt most USRussian diplomatic interactions and the looming threat of manufactured climate change is discredited as an ideological capitalist ploy.  These facts and others stand as evidence that the more things change the more they stay the same.  The best I have seen the new series do is debunk religious origin stories with extremely minor references to the dangers of climate change.With all that said I acknowledge that the mission of Cosmos is science education not political soap boxing.  But the fragility of the human race was of such paramount importance to Dr Sagan that it allowed the nuclear conversation to supersede the boundaries of science education and find a place on Cosmos.  We might not currently live in an age of constant fear or even have memory of such a time  notwithstanding but I happen to agree with Dr Sagan on his opinions regarding the dangers of selfdestruction.  I certainly hope that the new series finds a place to make this stance and the Pale Blue Dot monologue in particular a centerpiece topic.Final thought I am reminded of a Sagan Series clip called The Long Astronomical Perspective which for me perfectly captured the simultaneous hope and despair conveyed by Sagan regarding this topic.

788135,0,t3_235mt8,The main problem is that neutrinos interact very very weakly with matter. This is why SuperKamiokande has so many detectors in it.It also has to be so far underground to filter out nonsense from other kinds of particles.So the first logistical problem is that you need a bunch of very big expensive detectors buried a half mile deep all around the globe.The second problem is one of exposure.If you view a telescope as a camera and these detectors as the film. The problem is there isnt a material you can really use that blocks neutrinos to act as a camera body. So they come in from all directions. This is like just exposing an oldschool roll of film to the light without a camera. You dont get an image just a white blur.The camera obscura he loves to reference in the show works because you can restrict light to come in from a given direction. Telescopes just build on that design.IIRC Neil referenced during the show about how a series of flashes he was talking about had come through from the other side of the earth and a decent part of the last show was talking about how during a supernova they can run out straight through the surface of a star so this isnt a small problem.,Cosmos,cgtv5a6,3,t5_2s0xk

It is what I object to. Faith is not a virtue. If there ever was such a thing as a sin I would say having faith despite a lack of evidence even contrary to the evidence is the only contender.gt I interpret the bible not literally but as the word of God interpreted by man meaning that because God will not reveal himself though scientific or other means.Without trying to sound like Im generalizing No you dont interpret the bible as the word of God. You are taking what you already believe and projecting it onto what was written in the bible. This is a short cut to false claims.Also please note that you are making a claim about the real world as such it can be tested. The problem is you draw with such broad strokes that its impossible to know what you really believe God is. It might be that you realize this and do this on purpose I dont know. But if you do decide to define God in any reasonable terms it can be tested without a problem. Again you are making a claim about the real world. If God affects the world in any way shape or form there will be evidence to be gleaned from this. If you truly believe God is real you should have no problem presenting such a definition of him that we can test it. Saying God cant be tested is saying you dont believe in him nearly enough that you are willing to risk falsifying the claims you making. I take this as evidence that you know it cant be true.gt With Christ we can take his words literally and that is to love your neighbor and overall be the best person for the world to have. In those regards I have taken the morals of a Bronze Age man and applied it to todays society.He is not the only person in history to have said to love our neighbours. Let me quote you my favourite quote from Sam Harris The End of FaithNo myths need be embraced for us to commune with the profundity of our circumstance. No personal God need be worshiped for us to live in awe at the beauty and immensity of our creation. No tribal fictions need be rehearsed for us to realize one fine day that we do in fact love our neighbours that our happiness is inextricable from their own and that our interdependence demands that people everywhere be given the opportunity to flourish.It is clear to me that people dont believe that they should love their neighbors and be good persons because it says so in the bible. They already know and believe that. I dont quite understand how you can overlook the horridness that is the old testament and in part the new testament although I will grant you that the new testament is a step in the right direction not quite reaching the goal  in fact seemingly missing it by light years and becoming blinded by general pithy and empty wisdom about how we should treat each other. The bible clearly sanctions slavery and Jesus did not speak against the idea in any form. But out of all the moral ponderings we have ever dealt with it seems the question of whether it is morally right to own another human being as property is the easiest one to find an answer to. Yet the bible suspiciously fails this question. Why?gt Humans have interpreted the bible to mean what they believe it means that has lead to a great deal of strife over it being strangely worded for being the word of God.This is very simply explained if you buy that it was indeed not inspired by God but was merely written by a culture demonstrably inferior of our own on every level.,Cosmos,ch4huvb,3,t5_2s0xk

1150598,0,t3_27ayrr,I disagree and think he conveys wonderawe and curiosity well. Though you may call me biased because Ive only seen a few lectures of Cox and YouTube videos but I prefer NDT because Ive been a fan of his for a while and read a few of his books. Im a podcast listener of his podcast Star Talk Radio. But comparing either of the two to Sagan should be taken in context I have seen Sagans Cosmos and thought Sagan has a gift I cannot describe. He is able to boil things down to their simplest form in an effortless way. Hes a great communicator and I think his series was probably stronger in my mind than this one not to say that this one isnt fantastic as well I preordered the Blu Ray first chance I got.This series however was written almost purely by Ann Druyan and Steven Soter who were cowriters in the first one along with Sagan. Neil talked on his podcast about how he initially shared the writing room with Druyan and Soter but soon left because they had an incredible dynamic between the two and he felt like the third wheel. So Neil is speaking through their words. Though Im sure hed agree with what theyre saying I dont think he would put it quite the same way. That is a little apparent in the show where hes pretty much taking on an acting role reciting the lines as written. This little difference I think limits his charisma in explaining things. When you see him in lectures and interviews he is so much more animated passionate and engaging. Here he felt a little off but still great because the material was fantastic. Just not his material.,Cosmos,chz21a3,7,t5_2s0xk

Ive also read no current research on how we model or understand black holes so take everything Im about to say with a grain of salt.My understanding is that once you cross the schwarzschild radius of a blakc hole our current mathematical models for how time and space behave break down. Basically you can say that black holes might create new universes or maybe they just form a bridge to existing universes. Maybe they lead forward and backward through time or across vast gulfs of distance. Maybe they dont go anywhere at all and the center is just an infinitely dense point. Maybe they are full of cats and hockey pucks. Any one of these theories might be correct but there is no way to model what might be true because a there is no way to directly observe information from inside the black hole and b the mathematics needed to model what might be inside a black hole doesnt even exist yet. Based on my understanding of the current body of knowledge any guess as to what might wait inside a black hole is just that a guess. Some guess might be better than others cats and hockey pucks is probably wrong but there is currently no way to really test or support these hypotheses.,Cosmos,ckcqbbb,2,t5_2s0xk
