Theres been what I like to refer to as an indie game bubble. Minecraft was so ridiculously popular and made such giant heaps of money that it inspired scores of people to quit their day jobs to try and make games. Couple that with other media like Indie Game The Movie and you have too many people making too many games for a fairly niche market. So now its sort of like the wild west. People are clamoring for good ideas looking for something that will still and be the next Minecraftesque success story. Its created a very strange environment where people are very hostile and competitive but also very willing to help each other out because of the prevailing attitude from when UNIX was the big thing and everybody was trying to help everybody else out. ,computerscience,cikaao4,1,t5_2qj8o

5076082,0,t1_cux5qz9,Threading is making the computer run multiple lines of code at the same time. It works by running the program on multiple processors in the computer simultaneously. Its useful if you have a lot of work you want the computer to do quickly or you need several things done in tandem.Serialization is a process where an object is translated into a file of symbols that contain all of the information about it which can then be reconstructed into the same object. Its a lot like the toString method except it captures all of the information about the object and you dont have to write out a new method for it.Time complexity is just the number of steps an algorithm will take to run relative to the input size. So if the input is an array of ints and the program is just a for loop that goes through all of the ints once the time complexity is N where N is a variable standing for the size of the array. If there are two nested for loops then the time complexity is N. Space complexity is how much memory the program uses.,computerscience,cuxuy1v,1,t5_2qj8o

5517138,0,t3_3qmyh8,gt He writes The for family of syntactic forms support iteration over sequences. Lists vectors strings byte strings input ports and hash tables can all be used as sequences and constructors like inrange offer even more kinds of sequences. Variants of for accumulate iteration results in different ways but they all have the same syntactic shape. I know what for loops are and know some Racket and I still had to read that a good  times before I fully understood it. Iterating is one of those words that makes sense to the writer and seems to be a perfect word for describing what a for loop does but it is super confusing to a beginner.Ive been working with some Lisps since I was a freshman in college I used Schema in my CS  class and Id have to say the definition of the author is closer to the real meat than your statement... with LISPs.  Also lets not forget the forloop in Racket is not as widely used as in say... Clanguages.  This probably fell under the giant heading of  Iterators and Comprehensions not Forloops.  In the Lispier languages you dont find yourself doing this pattern very oftenfor i   i lt j i ...You do things more likemap somefunction list      gt we need to say A for loop goes through a list vector or other set of elements in a row and does the action in the for loop for each element in the series until it meets the conditions to stop.Does it mutate each object?

5821871,0,t1_cxi28pp,gt Anyway Im not being rational Im really rather frustrated and getting more and more depressed about the whole situation.That is your problem right there. Depression is a truly vicious cycle. I hope you can find the strength and support to help you break it. Your school likely already has some support infrastructure but it may take some work to find it. You can ask your academic advisor for help finding where to go or just look for an office thats titled something like student success center. Actually pretty much any office should be able to point you in the right direction. Depression is a big issue amongst college students and the faculty and staff are not ignorant of that by any means.What I think you might not be considering here is that when you skip class youre missing out on much more than just a lecture. Lectures are a dime a dozen. In fact they literally give them away for free on YouTube. What you are missing out on is an opportunity to ask an expert any question you want and get answers tailored to your background and your capabilities or perhaps an upandcoming expert if your lab is run by a TA. Thats a really powerful thing and you paid a lot of good money for it.Plus and be completely honest with yourself how much did you accomplish during those hours you should have been in lab? Did you earn more credit in that eleventh hour than a late penalty would have cost you if youd turned it in later that evening? In any case there cant be any harm in asking for a few hour extension so that you can work on your homework after class instead of during class. Even if your professor is completely unreasonable and unusually harsh about hisher deadlines in all likelihood they will simply assess a small late penalty and offer some guidance for catching up and moving forward. Your professor doesnt want you to fail its bad for you bad for them and bad for the school if you do.TLDR Get help for your depression then get help from your professor.,computerscience,cxirtep,1,t5_2qj8o
5901463,0,t1_cxt08ln,That sounds about right. Youre going to see that after this semester maybe even after one more youre going to be taking more CS classes. For example Ill be taking  CS classes next semester and  foreign language class. Universities all have different graduation requirements. For example my program requires  units to graduate but I know Ill have passed that amount because of extra classes I took at CC for not listening to my advisor.As for the math dont sweat not having taken calculus already. Take it now and move forward. In my case calculus  was a corequisite for one of two remaining math so I took them at the same time discreet math and calc. The last math class being Linear Algebra. There isnt that much math for a CS degree compared to say a physics or math major those guys have to take calc.If you find yourself having trouble with any math or CS concepts be proactive and seek tutoring or use the free resources available like khanacademy.org or codeacademy.comHonestly when people talk about college being a waste of time I dont believe Comp Sci majors can be considered part of that conversation. Youve chosen a field that together with a PASSION for your craft will ensure your hard work is worth it in the end.

8626530,0,t3_4xhii6,Yes I have totally gone through this. A few years ago I thought I would never cut it as a Computer Science student and just like you I had so much trouble writing code. I think the key here is practice. After solving enough problems you start to see patterns and develop an intuition for writing code.Have you learned Python or Java? The best thing I ever did for my confidence as a programmer was go through the problems here  The problems start out pretty simple but I think you can pick up some great fundamentals from going through the basics like this. If you dont know Python or Java you could also try a site like HackerRank. I like the interface there and you can find some really simple problems to start out with to get your confidence up. Please dont give up! Once I gained confidence in my ability to program I realized that being in this field is so fun and rewarding. You can do it! ,computerscience,d6jx46q,1,t5_2qj8o

Its really website  because hosting a page for say every single self.computerscience post would need a lot of storage space. You can right click on this very page and check view source to verify this.    So they have these templates but they dont copypaste them for each entry but instead take a part of the url the server receives like tt for  Guardians of the galaxy and fill the moviespecific parts from their movie database.    I know this isnt  true but a dumbed down version I just want you to get the idea so you dont go around making scripts that copy a template and fill it with data then output that into a static html served by the webserver.,computerscience,d7ahdxq,3,t5_2qj8o

9726260,0,t3_5eb7rl,My story really isnt that cool but Ill tell it anyway because its kind of relevant. A couple of years ago I worked as a load tester at a big Canadian company based in Toronto that well call DEF. The company was doing a transition from mainframe to distributed systems and I was on the SQA team for the project which well call Project S. Project S was already many millions of dollars and a year and a half over budget when I started but things were still moving along albeit slowly. Over the next year things gradually fell apartments ground to a halt in Project S. Many many millions more were spent but the main issue was never acknowledged or addressed. I believe the issue was that instead of hiring a team of developers on salary to do he transition they had all the developers desks on a  or  month rotating door. It was just this never ending stream of about  developers on very short contracts. This made for a HUGE mess. The database which I was the first to fully map out was about  empty tables or tables with cryptic information that was seemingly meaningless. Almost the entire system ran on  tables. The code was awful and it was just generally terrible. This meant that although my tests worked there was seldom anything new to run them against and the code didnt update the test reporting tables so it was very hard or even impossible for me to really know the results of my tests.But we ran them anyway because that was our job. In the last quarter that I worked there we got a total of one new patch. I ran all my tests and sent my results off. That was the last I heard of it and I spent the rest of my time automating my job. The good partFast forward to the week before the quarterly IT all hands meeting where my manager would have to present numbers from our testing for the quarter. But my test suite had about  tests in it and that was not a very good number to report. My manager called me over and pointed at the big  on his screen indicating how many jobs had been run. He wanted to know if he could say that we had run  tests without lying and I told him no because each test has multiple jobs read scripts and that each one was not analogous to a test. He said okay and sent me away. Fast forward to the presentation.What does he say we did? Run  tests. Did I say anything? No. What did I say when I was asked why I only had results for  tests instead of ? Nothing. My contract was up in a week. ,computerscience,dabz3xa,3,t5_2qj8o

However I wouldnt be where I am now without that private school.In short find a way to get your Bachelors of Science. Look for a school that has a good career placement program with COOPs.

10450087,0,t3_5pn9bp,Without seeing a curriculum its tough to say for sure.  But some general thoughts Assuming youre doing this to cut down on the time youll spend in a bachelors program you need to make sure you dont miss out on the fundamentals. Most programs teach algorithms  data structures and computer architecture early in the program make sure to have a solid foundation in these programs  IMO the most important courses to take in any CS program are probability linear algebra and discrete mathematics.  If you have a good math foundation everything else comes pretty easily.  CS programs teach problem solving through mathematics. That said learn how to write good code. Get experience in a few languages then get good at least one. Java C Python are all solid candidates.  Practice solving problems. Im a fan of Project Euler although it is very mathfocused. There are lots of other resources but the take away is that there are often elegant solutions to many problems. There are lots of online courses to help fill the gaps in your knowledge. If you have an idea where you want to transfer look at the curriculum to make sure you have experience. It is also important to ask these departments about how your experiences compare to what they are teaching. ,computerscience,dcsm4sg,5,t5_2qj8o

You understand it seems the concept of an abstract class that has to be implemented to be used. Well Integer and Double are classes that do that to Number. When the program says Integer intVal   that declares intVal to be an instance of the class Integer and thus an instance of the class Number. The function doubleValue is a function from the Number class. Any instance of the Number class has it. So you can get the doubleValue of intVal by running intVal.doubleValue,computerscience,ddinu22,1,t5_2qj8o
