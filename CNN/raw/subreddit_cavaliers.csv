Matzah Balls can be cute rightThat and when we had him neutered I could joke that we Chopped off Matzahs Balls. I thought the joke would quickly go stale like old Matzah! but it was indeed funny every time.,cavaliers,cl3rter,2,t5_2rq50

10776502,0,t1_ddrhd7e,Ive a friend who got a largish stuffed animal close to the size their English Springer would be as an adult they took a monthly photo of the pup with the stuffed animal. They wouldnt let her chew on it while she was growing so it would last and she must have imprinted it a little because she only carries it around gently and snuggles it. They have these adorable photos that show her growth next to this static hot pink elephant that she now carries around by the trunk.,cavaliers,ddriocg,4,t5_2rq50
