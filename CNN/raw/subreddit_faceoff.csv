180259,0,t1_cewlvy5,I dont get the sense that Matt knows what he is doing or that he is full of it.  I think that hes just very nervous and possibly he doesnt have as much talent as the other contestants.  Im not saying he DOESNT deserve to go next.  Im just saying that I like him.  he seems sweet.,faceoff,ceyyu8c,1,t5_2qymq

1818005,0,t1_cjyv5xr,That would be awesome! They could do amazing fabrications and we could focus on the facehandsbody. Im not sure about the timing since Ive never fabricated a puppet but I think it could work.... RW,faceoff,ck894x3,3,t5_2qymq
2030682,0,t1_ckxx2pe,Nah your giving her too much credit and smarts?. when she was partnered with Stella she ruined that makeup with her only real contribution  stupid boxing glove hands which Stella keep asking her to remove. That makeup should have won the challenge over the more typical tree and was one of the best makeups this whole season,faceoff,ckxy00y,3,t5_2qymq

2174232,0,t3_2jybhj,Noooo! I thought Georges squid head was great! Im just so bummed to see him just miss the finale... Dinas mantis killed it though damn. It was amazing and shows just how crazy talented she is. Its a toss up for me between Dina and Cig to win it all. They both deserve it and will definitely have great careers ahead of them.,faceoff,clg745r,17,t5_2qymq

2958928,0,t1_co4a9q8,Im glad Im not the only one who felt that way. I felt kind of mean thinking it felt flat. I was thinking that since faceoff is extremely drama free no tears etc. The marriage proposal felt really out of place. ,faceoff,co4g0ms,8,t5_2qymq

4434283,0,t3_3buad0,The first is where theyre feeling themselves out just like rpdr dont start with it. The third is probably the strongest in the earlier seasons. After that you can just go in order really but thats probably a good season to cut your teeth on.If you go further there are some spoilers for past seasons due to the formats part newcomers part veterans team leaders for example. There shouldnt be any s that I can remember... But there might. Cant promise offhand.Otherwise go ham. Faceoff is really nice in that its all about the art... Past season one. ,faceoff,cspmn0s,8,t5_2qymq

5085835,0,t1_cu7vjmd,I think a point system could work in a show like RU Pauls Drag Race where a large portion of the show is about interpersonal drama. A show like FaceOff Or a FaceOff  All Stars a point system could result in someone just constantly being shit and obviously losing. ,faceoff,cuz1b6b,1,t5_2qymq

10490579,0,t3_5pz9nx,I want to say I expect the quality of all the creations to be top notch since all of the teams are both veterans and all creations are going to be made with two people.  This episode had some amazing designs and Im glad to see the new challenge of the greenscreen. the team aspect seems to be bothering some people here but I excited due to the above reason the makeups are going to be spectacular. Im okay with the every other week elimination as it can allow for a poor week but hopefully can make up for the times that something goes wrong. Lemme talk about the teamsAdam and Logan Both of these guys have big imaginations and I was rooting for them both on season Ben and Evan two finalists working together they had a bad week this week but they can pull themselves out of this. Ben did with his reboot alien and Evan did it in the Addams family type challenge. Cig and George They put it best on the show Cig is more crazy and George less so they can have a good balance. I think everyone is expecting this team to go far. Emily and Tyler They both have a good sense of whimsy and fun and both have tons of talent. I really expect this team to go far. Jasmine and Stella Both of these ladies have a great sense of style and I think they really compliment each other with the skills they have. I dont want to see them eliminated but between them and Ben and Evan my money would be on Ben and Evan...Sorry ladiesKeaghlan and Melissa Both blue hair! I though Melissa was going to win on season  and Keaghlan impressed me out of the gate with her life character. Really looking forward to this team. Niko and Cat I thought these two were the weakest of the artists coming back but maybe working together they balance each other out. They are a couple and probably know each other strengths and weaknesses very well.  I thought they were cute with Niko talking about giver her kisses. I hope that doesnt get old. Rachel and Gage This team really impressed me with their look this week. I ready to see more from them. ,faceoff,dcx7u6f,5,t5_2qymq
10625608,0,t3_5qk1bw,I used to work with plaster and fiberglass eeugh... jackets at a museum creating cradles and molds for fossils...In general youre trying to split the mold along a zone of weakness which ideally lies between the two halves.  Tools like chisels will send a percussive shock through the hard brittle plaster Hydrocal? Ultracal? and can cause those weak zones to propagate outward where they may have been sealed together.  That will ideally cause them to separate where they should.Power tools like saws dont create that crackforming percussive force they just obliterate everything under the teeth.  You can use them for removing extra plaster but they arent going to help you split a stuck mold.  Plus theyre rather brutal and imprecise and if they do crack something its likely going to be in the wrong place and just destroy your mold.  If we wanted to trim plaster off a jacket we always used horse nippers  the giant nailclippers you use to trim horse hooves that lets you make a clean and precise snip without all that extra kinetic energy,faceoff,ddby82g,5,t5_2qymq

11127382,0,t1_det3o45,I think this as well... I think the judges are sometimes in the position to pick the best makeup out of a pool of makeups with obvious issues. This is due to the time constraint. Film Ready to me means that away from the show this makeup would be good enough to be on film that day. ,faceoff,deta2ci,5,t5_2qymq
