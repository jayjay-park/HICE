5331060,0,t3_3o1a76,Just pack some media from your established tank the morning before you go to work and transport it in some tank water. Itll be fine for a few hours as long as it remains wet. Is also increase the ammonia level to at least  ppm. I find smaller tanks to take longer to cycle than bigger tanks.,TankStarter,cvt3pl2,4,t5_39eag
5826919,0,t3_3t8orv,Ive used a few ideas i found after googleing to reuse or DIY the filter Cartridge for my Aqueon Quietflow series filter.in essence. take a used cartridge that youre going to discard. Cut off all the floss on the plastic frame. I bought a pack of marineland Filter Floss and cut an appropriate sized square off. used a razor to split it in the middle and insert the used frame. reinsert my ml bag of Purigen inside the frame  filter area. insert the completed DIY cartridge into my filter.so far its saved me at least  on new filter cartridges and you can rinse  shake off the filter floss in old tank water during Water changes and the Purigen has held up fantasticaly.,TankStarter,cxjfnoq,1,t5_39eag
