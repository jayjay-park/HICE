It also would be less interesting as there cant be any fan analysis over who would win. Basically if your not a fictional character youre probably not going to be in Death Battle.tldr No.,ScrewAttack,cxh7bn9,1,t5_2rre3

11553553,0,t1_dg5htsq,Gotta agree even if I liked that fight. It just seemed more sensible to me if here they stuck to one incarnation of Voltron and the Megazord. Like if they want nostalgia go for strictly original anime Voltron and MMPR season  megazord. If they want popular or more up to date same megazord or use the BOOM! comics one and Netflix!Voltron. ,ScrewAttack,dg5lkj3,3,t5_2rre3
