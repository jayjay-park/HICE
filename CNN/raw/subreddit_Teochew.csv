1646104,0,t1_cjml0aw,I can only read Korean too I dont know the meanings and how to make my own sentences I only know the really really basic phrases like hello i love you thank you etc.. But hey its something. And yea Chinese is just a huge mass of confusion for me. I also attempted Japanese but then I said NOPE when I saw all those kanji symbols and all that and I was like NOPENOPENOPENOPENOPE. I have a feeling that it would be harder than Chinese since Japanese uses Chinese characters. So they have Chinese which is already hard af to learn and then they tack on their own extra alphabet. Thats just a recipe for NOPE.Cambodia? Thats really cool! Never really knew anyone who was Cambodian well there was one person but I dont like her... And I dont know if its just me but I dont really like viet food that much haha. I mean I dont hate them all. I love pho spring rolls and a bunch of other rice noodle dishes but Id say  of the viet stuff my grandparents cook I dont really like. I still eat it though because if I didnt I would be scolded and yelled at and all that XD. Maybe my slight dislike came from simply eating the same stuff every weekend lol I dont know. Im personally a fan of Korean food and there are so many Korean restaurants around where I live so thats nice P,Teochew,cjmnlbb,1,t5_30ww6
