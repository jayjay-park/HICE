1520004,0,t3_2blclb,I appreciate this explanation and I think you understand the great cost that war imposes on leadership.  There was actually a discussion regarding your request but I think you may not have been online during that time and for that I apologize.  Here is the reason we decided not to allow sniping even though it would not have affected the outcome of the war at all.  Several players of all levels were able to use their two attacks early in the war which gave us the insurmountable lead which we experienced.  By using both attacks according to the rules some lower level players would not have been able to benefit from the sniping opportunity.  Since we couldnt determine a fair way to implement a rule change midwar we opted not to.  Parc and Nate Father and Son chose to flagrantly violate the rule without consulting the elders.  They both sniped and attacked out of their range and for that they were kicked as they amassed  strikes in a single war.My opinion is the nature of this game is intentionally frustrating when it comes to goldelixir expense as to motivate people to spend money on Gems.  As such it is impossible for us as a clan to create rules to alleviate this frustration.  While we have worked hard to create a fair set of rules so that we can all enjoy the clan wars we will never be able to modify the war rules to eliminate that pressure.  For what it is worth I think your suggestion had merit and it was thoroughly discussed among the elders and leaders.  I think we all feel like we wished there was a way to reward the substantial victory but we just didnt feel like we could allow the sniping as it would seem to punish those who helped create the lead to begin with.  I hope this helps explain what our thinking was.  Thanks for the well drafted comments and keep them coming!Sir C,redditquandary,cj6t5lx,1,t5_2yhqt
