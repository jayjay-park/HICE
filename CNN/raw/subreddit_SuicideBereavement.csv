2231663,0,t3_2km1cq,I went every other week for about  months. I was having a really hard time around the year mark of when my husband died so I went in for a session. Your therapists goal should be to make it so you dont need them anymore by giving you coping mechanisms you can use on your own. When I stopped going we both agreed I didnt need to come in regularly but I could always callschedule an appointment if I was feeling overwhelmed.,SuicideBereavement,clnhx7j,1,t5_2wsjv
3043710,0,t1_cod4wbi,I understand there will never be that full closure of goodbye that we need. And it is an incredibly horrible  reality. The only things that keep me going are my sister God and the realization that life is meant to be lived because i believe most of us dont really understand that we are dying every second that goes by. I know that no amount of Im sorrys or She is in heaven now will take away your pain. I think you just eventually come to accept that person chose this on their terms because they felt they couldnt fight their inner voices any longer. I like to think through my depression from this event i have learned to relate to those inner voices and i understand how powerful those can be. And i made a decision to allow my inner voice to be one that chooses life and doesnt fall victim to the demons. It takes work but it is the only way in my opinion. Good luck on your journey and know there is hope but we have to put one foot in front of the other and eventually we become wiser and stronger because of loss. Hugs,SuicideBereavement,codha78,1,t5_2wsjv
4882118,0,t1_cu7cq70,She died in April. I feel guilty if I go a few days and Im not sad. Its almost easier to forget shes gone and just act normal. I get really depressed whenever I think of her and I almost feel like I need to cry after a long enough time or else I start to get extremely negative toward many things. I just want a happy memory.Thinking of her laugh and smile is great and I miss it so much. ..I just had to take a moment just now typing this because after reading what you wrote and thinking about things a memory came back to me. It was the week I met her daughter my niece when she was only  months old. There are several pictures of my niece and I all taken by my sister. I think I will think of that specific week when I am feeling down.Thank you.,SuicideBereavement,cu9xg45,3,t5_2wsjv
6338727,0,t3_42f5zg,I am so sorry for your loss. Its hard when you see the signs vaguely and then something happens...but know this Its not your fault. The same thing happened with me and my brother when he committed suicide I think of all the things I could have done or said I could have pushed harder to get him to talk about his darkness. But again this is not your fault. The people who do this are the best at hiding their intentions. Your feelings are valid and you deserve to get help as well. Please talk to someone and know that youre welcome to rant here anytime.,SuicideBereavement,cza55ib,3,t5_2wsjv

7385571,0,t1_d2f8kwp,gtHey Im so incredibly sorry for your loss. Ive been exactly where you are right now. Its horrible. I lost my ability to feel happy or any emotions for that matter for a while because I felt guilty to feel when she couldnt. To be happy without her felt worse than a crime. Yesterday was her one year anniversary. Honestly I never would have thought that I could make it this long without her. She was my soulmate.gtTo this day though it still doesnt feel real though. Whether Ive experienced a happy or a terrible moment shes still the person I want to tell all about it first. Shes still my first port of call. And then I realise shes not there. And I die inside all over again. It kills me.gtThinking of her funeral takes me into a dark space. I helped screw on her lid. I saw her in her casket and helped put on the lid. It really fucks me up. But at the same time I guess it gave me a physical sense of closure. I dont know.gtAnyway Im so sorry for rambling. I guess I just want you to know youre not alone. I wish with all my heart that I could give you a hug.gtIm sure Jess and your mate are having a blast up in heaven. All my love. xxThank you for your kind words. You are not rambling I myself was a huge part of the funeral process and was with his family that whole time. I lowered him into the ground thats when it hit. Now the funeral is over Im all alone. I just keep trying to process it all. Like i always cried on his shoulder. Why didnt he. Things like that. I feel so sorry for him. What where his last thoughts? Was he scared? Was he at peace? I to myself load up fb messenger and go what we doing this weekend. But he deactivated his fb and then i remember when i cant find him. I do hope he is watching down on us with Jess. I hope for a normal life i just cant see it. A virtural hug for you.,SuicideBereavement,d2hotal,1,t5_2wsjv

10063184,0,t3_5j90t9,Thats what scares me. The feeling of frustration that nothing will ever ever bring them back and they are missing out on so much. We used to talk about politics all the time.

10413951,0,t3_5p4oun,Hi! Its not a coincidence that u read your thread. My mom was gone the same day. Also heavy influence with religion with infused eye with darkness and guilt. My father who was rarely kind to her decided to keep a secret. I can on many levels relate to what you are going through. My emotions became so numb and shallow that Id hurt my boyfriend without knowing it. In the end he left me.. The pain pushed me to see what has changed in me..We can never change others. We can only change ourselves. When emptiness seeks you try to think this is just a trick! Im able to get and feel happy again. Dont be too buried under all the confusion from your family. Find your own definition and stick with it. Leave the toxic people that give you a hard time using the name of religion. Slowly pressure will leave you and youll feel happiness more often. We will never forget what we see and experienced. But its about finding a balance between accepting that and keeping life going and not letting the sorrow change us or go over others. It really requires a lot  of kindness and tolerance but its doable! Thinking of you and hope you pull through ,SuicideBereavement,dcohmdr,1,t5_2wsjv

10635775,0,t3_5s6w94,What about alternative treatment options? If youre considering this have you at least considered ECT? Its supposed to have a crazy success rate of like  and is now totally painless. Personally medical marijuanaCBD oil treated my depression and saved my life. Getting an emotional support animal also really helped. Any animal can become an emotional support animal with a little training and a doctors recommendation. I dont know what is hurting you but I do know what its like to be where you are. When I was there I believed all kinds of lies my brain told me about how I was worthless and would never mean anything to the world that I would never have the things I dreamed of or even the things I needed and that no one even gave a shit. Now that Im healed I recognize my brain was sick thats all. I hope you can manage to heal what is killing you and you can give your body the chance to think healthy and happy thoughts again or even for the first time. There are treatment options. There is hope. Pm me if you want to talk Im always looking for new friends.  ,SuicideBereavement,ddczyuf,3,t5_2wsjv
10835515,0,t1_ddx3myh,Sorry for your loss. I missed calls from my brother the day he hung himself. Its normal to feel guilty about the things we could have done.

10905838,0,t3_5vtcqq,Being in this position youre going to be providing a lot of support but probably not really getting any.  Dont take for granted your own self care in the coming weeks and months.  Youve suffered a loss as well.  Listen to your wife when she talks and show her youre listening. You may not really have anything to say sometimes but thats Ok.  Probably the biggest thing I learned was that everyone grieves differently. Theres no wrong way unless its harmful like drugs or reliance on alcohol. Some people talk. Some people dont want to see anyone. Grieving happens though no matter what so avoiding it is pointless and will only make it worse and take longer. My wife and I talked a lot for months then joined a grief group. Hearing from other people in similar situations helps a lot even if you only listen.  Also try and avoid any additional stress for a while lile changing jobs moving home projects.  Most of your emotional capacity will be filled up with the grief process and the regular small things may become quite overbearing.  I highly recommend seeing a counselor and then trying a group out in your area. It may even be free. If not your employer may offer a benefit to pay for some sessions via wellness program. Take care of yourselves and make sure youre on the same page to keep your relationship healthy. ,SuicideBereavement,de4uyqo,5,t5_2wsjv

11558435,0,t3_64km95,For me there were several things that have helped. It helped to talk with a few people that have been through the same thing. Not about how to cope but about our real feelings and the pain of loss and how long its taking to deal with it. Being with people who do truly understand and offer nothing but sharing the load really does help.It helped to slowly over time go through my departeds things and my mementos sorting through what I wanted to keep and what I was willing to part with. This honors the memory of the dead somehow while at the same time not pretending they are still alive.For me personally it was very important to pour myself into writing what I wanted to say at the memorial service. I wanted to paint him exactly as he was both great and sad and to paint me exactly as I am in the wake of it. It helped to express things. And after a while I did do counseling. By then I think I was already talked out but in the course of explaining how the last few months had been the counselor could spot things I had not noticed or dealt with. My counselor also had a few interesting clinical techniques that just seem to work well for PTSDlike things and they did seem to help as if by magic. What I sense in your post though is that youre torn between wanting to get better but also not better so fast that it diminishes her memory or her impact on you. To that just let me suggest that you cut yourself some slack and allow yourself to take the time needed however long it takes. When you start to get better it will also seem like the right amount of time to have given her your sorrow. It will never be completely better but you dont really want it to be that anyway. ,SuicideBereavement,dg65igu,1,t5_2wsjv
11596143,0,t3_65hmiu,The best way Ive found to deal with guilt is by working to realize that its absolutely  true that sometimes there is NOTHING we can do. No matter how much you love someone even if you COULD be there every second of ever day hell even helping them get professional help doesnt promise a happy ending. Sometimes people cant be saved Ive tried over and over and sometimes it has worked and sometimes it hasnt. There have also been people who I had no idea were struggling NO ONE knew and they made it out alive. No one CAN ever be responsible for another life that wishes to end. Its not in your hands no matter how much you wish it could have been. Guilt certainly is normal but its a lie our brains tells us just because we care too much. Loving someone will never be enough to save them unfortunately.,SuicideBereavement,dgafjb2,3,t5_2wsjv
