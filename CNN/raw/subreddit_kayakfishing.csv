7893180,0,t3_4ndhp5,I use cane. Well technically the ones I use are bamboo. I use them at  for push poles in my creek boat and at eight to ten feet for shallow water anchors in my twelve foot kayak. Totally free. I usually use them green and as needed. I dried one last year and sealed it but we lost it one night.,kayakfishing,d439mlw,1,t5_2snlv

8008405,0,t1_d4g7guq,I got a Yakima sweet roll. My kayak is  wide and lbs so I wanted a cradle. The fact that I always load it solo meant I needed something with rollers at the back to help get it on top of my SUV. Much more expensive but I opted for convenience. Depends on the size and weight of your kayak for the j stackers,kayakfishing,d4g7xie,1,t5_2snlv
8078433,0,t3_4ou96e,I anchored today   on my depth finder. It dead still and no wind. I was one some fish. I felt fine. I usually just let out ft of line total off my bow and the current dropped me right over where I wanted to be. ,kayakfishing,d4o3am2,1,t5_2snlv

8385853,0,t1_d5plj8q,I found the creek channel. Actually a river channel that dumps into the lake. All the bass were parked at about  off a structure A rock formation I think. I caught  in the same place. Garlic scent may actually work. My buddy with the fish finder didnt catch a thing. ,kayakfishing,d5ps2x9,1,t5_2snlv

8723482,0,t1_d6tiyqs,This... Peopleve been kayak fishing for a lot longer than the current dedicatedpurpose boat era.The main benefit to modern fishing kayaks is the open layout which makes carryingmanipulating your rods and other tackle easier and the almost silly amount of stability you get which allows you to fish worry free.If youre comfortable in a different style of boat already you can certainly fish out of it.  That will give you a chance to get on the water learn what you likedont like and then you can try different boats to see what would fit you the best.I started with an LL Bean sitin kayak and later moved to a WS Ride  sitontop fishing yak.  I love the fishability of the Ride but every time I get to paddle the sitin I miss its speed and glide.,kayakfishing,d6w2rii,1,t5_2snlv
8767497,0,t3_502idd,Yes! I have the Skimmer  ish?. I found it on Craigslist from a guy claiming to be the midwest rep for like  I cant remember. The kayak was clearly brand new and had never seen water.  I was on the fence about just buying one from Dicks but I was fully convinced on the Skimmer after I got to see it up close.      The Good   The weight is awesome its so light! I have some J racks up on my forester that I haul it with.   It tracks really well considering its not even  feet long. I suspect adding a rudder or a skeg would help fine tune this even more.   Has plenty of mounting pointstracks.   Scupper holes never let in water Im only lbs    The Bad   Not nearly as stable as I was hoping. For reference Im  on a good day. I would NOT feel comfortable standing.   Seat is a lot more comfortable than sitting on plastic however long excursions can start to get painful. Not a great way to keep the seats backrest pinned down while traveling down the road. If I hit mph I get a low pitched moaning from the wind howling over the seat. Yes I could just get some foam blocks and flip it upside down but the J racks are so simple.      Im by no means a diehard but feel free to ask me any other questions and Ill do my best to answer!,kayakfishing,d71lmo7,2,t5_2snlv
8777173,0,t1_d71wu5w,I got a little too brave with my Native Ultimate a few years ago and decided to try a surf launch in windy conditions. What followed was almost exactly what you describe. It was embarrassing scary and costly all at the same time lost  big spools of fluoro. It would have been much worse had I been alone at the time. ,kayakfishing,d72tcid,2,t5_2snlv

11304812,0,t1_dfd4twb,The reasoning for my interest in catching tuna from a kayak stems from the mothership trips. I had spoken with a few people have done it and they said it was extremely cool. It made me want to push the bar a little out here in the north east. If we get some really clean water inshore im going to try a beach launch. ,kayakfishing,dfddte1,1,t5_2snlv
