3280844,0,t3_2xpoel,I have made some revisions based on advise I got from a friend with his own linguistic leaning. the grave accents  and  ave been replaced by acute accents  and  as they aesthetically clashed with .  is now only used when at the beginning of a word or morpheme and now  is used when in the middle of the word or at the end. the reasoning for this is that Scots actually did this in the old texts. ltigt has been replaced with ltygt as ltygt is used for  the ih sound in other positions anyways. I hope it doesnt seem too daunting. it gives Scots its own flavour and is easy to pick up quickly,scots,cp28r93,0,t5_2slgu
