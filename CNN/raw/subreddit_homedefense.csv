1809364,0,t1_ck6ljwl,While authoritarianism may be tempting and it does work as a shortterm solution I  disagree with because I said so being the appropriate response to anything.  You need to explain EVERYTHING to kids to turn them into responsible adults.  My problem isnt with the disciplinary actions you have suggested.  Its only with the fact that youre suggesting that the parent doesnt ever need to explain themselves.  The kid still needs to obey you but children need teaching.  Because I said so isnt teaching.  By giving the REASON why you said so you are not negotiating anything.  Youre explaining the way life works.  Youre teaching that actions have consequences.  Youre putting decisions ON THEM.Reasons why authoritarianism is bad. Its lazy it doesnt teach kids anything except to fear the wrath of parents. It promotes disobedience it leads to trying to hide things from parents because the only issue in the kids mind is the parents displeasure and everything is okay if momdad doesnt know. It doesnt promote true responsibility and accountability for ones actions.  When the parent ISNT involved in situation what will the kid do?  If you say dont break windows because I said so the kid will almost CERTAINLY break them when they know that you cant find out.  If you teach WHY we dont break windows i.e. its not nice to break other peoples things how would you like it if I broke your TV etc. the child is more likely to internalize the lesson.  Because I said so parenting is why kids with authoritarian parents go crazy when they move outgo to college and trust me Ive seen it happen A LOT.  The minute an authoritarian parent no longer has control over a child lessons learned may very well evaporate. Seriously I said you cant go out and thats all there is to it.  You will lose privileges for six months.  The child has no agency in this and they arent learning anything.Versus Something like Son we have discussed that you cant go out at night because mom and I want to make sure that youre safe.  Youre only six years old and if an emergency were to happen we wouldnt be able to help you.  By sneaking out at night and disobeying us youre showing that you dont care about your own safety and that you dont deserve our trust.  We will be removing your privileges for x y and z for xxx amount of time until you demonstrate to us that you can be responsible.  This teaches that the child has control over their situation.  They are the ones making the decision to be punished or to obey.  They have agency.,homedefense,ck77agu,5,t5_2sagj

Blocking the cameras from going out on the internet and instead using a VPN to get in to your local network is better.  The problem you face is how to access your home network.  You almost definitely have a DHCP internet address so you need some positive way of being able to hit it even if the IP address changes.

7251834,0,t3_4eqiow,Wired is more reliable as there are no other wireless signals that could interfere. Wired does require you to drill into the walls run new wire and get into that hot attic to pull the wire to a centralized location in the house to put the main panel. Wired is cheaper as well for all of the individual sensors. Many modern panels will have some kind of ability to connect a computer to it through USB or a serial connection. Most modern panels will also allow mobile access in some form. Wired panels will have a battery backup built in so you will not have to be concerned about power outages and the home being insecure during that time. I do not know about modern panels but wired panels in the past have no way to update their software unless you know how to directly access the board and the board has the proper interface to do so. Usually upgrades will be full panel replacements.Wireless is freedom from having to dig into the walls and attic. The individual sensors are more expensive and are battery powered but many controllershubs will notify you of when they are running low. The battery should last  years. Wireless systems will certainly have access through a web or mobile interface. This access will require in internet connection either hard wired or wifi to a cloud service and the mobile apps will use that. This means that if the internet goes down you will not be able to remotely access the system or get notifications. You will also need to provide a UPS for power outages so that the controllerhub still functions. Wireless controllershubs can be and usually are updated remotely. You want this so that software doesnt get stale.,homedefense,d22hcj8,1,t5_2sagj

This means that you might be able to use a camera that has a mic with this system. I say might because you still need to check the NVR software and see if it can record audio.

If you want true discretion you need a security camera of some sort and an unlocked door. Look for a deal on a trail camera or game camera. Most are small enough to be hidden and much cheaper than specialty hidden security cameras. Also they are battery powered so no cords. If you really need a hidden lock solution you will need to build a remotely controlled deadbolt with an arduino. I have no idea as to the specifics. With all that said if you need to secure your room just install a deadbolt and be done with it.

10451026,0,t3_5pfo7q,I recommend building an a la carte system rather than buying a package.  You can pick and choose each camera rather than being stuck with a select allotment of bulletdome fixed lens cameras.  If you build your own you can get a couple of Varifocal cameras where you need them put in a bigger HDD make your own cable lengths and choose from a better selection of camera options and quantities.  With IP cameras you also have to consider interoperability.  For instance Hikvision cameras might not plugandplay with a Dahua or Axis NVR.  If youre going to mix and match brands be prepared to do a bit of extra research to be sure theyre compatible.  If possible stick to one brand to ensure compatibility.  Typically as long as the camera and NVR have the same ONVIF Profile they should work together but its not always that simple unfortunately.

11571660,0,t3_651r34,What security issues are you concerned with with the wireless sensors?  They dont use the standard . or k bandwidths most devices use.  They only thing someone could do would be to jam the signal which would trigger the alarm.I have the DSC Powerseries  with a wireless module for some sensors and Envisalink for OpenHAB integration.  The OpenHAB  DSC plugin didnt support the Action binding for allowing OpenHAB rules to do stuff which was patched but Im not sure if he officially released it.  Otherwise Ive had no issues with OpenHAB and DSC with my set up.The biggest security concern would be how well you protect your home network if you plan on using OpenHAB and what your OpenHAB setup is.  As a rule of thumb be very careful writing disarm functions if you write any at all.,homedefense,dg7njiz,1,t5_2sagj

11761046,0,t1_dgt19r0,I used TinyCam Pro on Android and it saw and could control the camera just fine...when it was connected to the router via Ethernet. You cant change the cameras wireless settings though without using its browserbased interface which is seemingly impossible in my environment.,homedefense,dgt578a,1,t5_2sagj
