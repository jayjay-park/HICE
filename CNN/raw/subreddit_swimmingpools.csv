1316026,0,t1_cihmsdr,Its not for the looks! Concrete is porous not water resistant which is why an interior coating is required.  Your pool will leak water constantly and you will have difficulty maintaining chemical balances.  Your mortar is being saturated with water which undermines the top surface integrity over time.  Think about doing some more work if you want this pool to function properly and last.,swimmingpools,ciho4ma,6,t5_2wlmd

2878791,0,t3_2t2wkf,Depending what the extra is for the intelliflow is it will pay for itself in  years. The heat pump may not be ideal for Wisconsin as they can be very temperamental. It isnt going to heat the water in a significant way it will more be used to add  or  degrees and take the chill off so to speak. It may extend your season by a couple of weeks at best. It really depends on what you want out of it. Most of your cost difference is likely going to be the autocover though. What system are they quoting?

4192122,0,t1_crvo9pc,Id go with uTyneyTymeys suggestion. The Great White is an awesome lil cleaner and is simple enough of a design to not warrant repairs all the time like they Haywards. Your pump is powerful enough to drive nearly any suction side cleaner.Another option you could consider would be a simpler robotic cleaner. The Aquabot Pool Rover is the first one that comes to mind. You can get different types of mesh bags to go inside of it depending on the debris you get throughout the year and you dont have to worry about it clogging up any lines or dumping debris into the filter.,swimmingpools,cry3mz9,2,t5_2wlmd

Try the cleaning routine of a little acid to the water let settle. stir by hand and backwash and let any ick stuff come over the top.

6163378,0,t1_cyq7dqb,Sorry about that and thanks! My current filter is leaking at the point where the top and bottom meet. I have replaced the o ring and I have added lube it held up for about three hours before leaking again when the pressure went up. I tried screwing the lid on as perfect as I could and the best as I could multiple times and each time I am still able to see parts of the oring at certain parts but I am not able to push the lid down any futher nor tighten it as its as tight as can be. Even with that it doesnt leak at first but with high pressures it does. I am lost as to buy  a new filter or figure out what is going on with mine any guidance would be appreciated thanks again.,swimmingpools,cyq7oa5,1,t5_2wlmd
6396511,0,t1_czgd8xi,Not to question whats happening  but theyre injecting O into the suction side of a Pentair variable speed pump? Doesnt sound like such a good idea there are sensors inside the volute that may be susceptible to oxidization  maybe.Anyway  good to hear about the pool water!I think O if done right is great and uV has impressed me since the first unit.Brushing the walls and floor vigorously will bring any algae spores on the walls into circulation and past the uV light. Enough brushing once twice a week would most likely completely negate the need for chlorine... at least I found that to be the case on a half dozen test pools.Id still worry a bit about such a powerful oxidizer being sucked through the pump  it WOULD mix it well though going through the impeller like that.,swimmingpools,czgpu8x,1,t5_2wlmd

8224084,0,t3_4s06ht,I didnt recognize the product you mentioned and so looked it up  why would anyone pay that much for a chlorinator? Okay  on to the problem at hand...If they used a wrench then they were doing it wrong to begin with. A wrench MAY be needed after a year of use and the lid oring becomes a bit crusty but on a new unit? No.Get them back out there and have them remove the lid. Then load the unit thats why I suppose youre trying to get the lid off and then put the lid back on HAND TIGHT only after making sure the lid oring is lightly lubricated with a silicone or teflon based lubricant.HAND TIGHTEN only.If they tell you the only way to put the lid on and off is to have a wrench then ask them why they didnt supply one with that overpriced chlorinator.,swimmingpools,d55ket8,0,t5_2wlmd

If your measuring from the center of the pipes and its coming pretty close to what the part is listing its probably the right one.  Keep in mind pipe diameters refer to the inside diameter of the pipe not the outside diameter.
