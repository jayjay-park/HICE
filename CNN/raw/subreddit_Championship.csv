I think  or  more points at most from the remaining games will be enough to secure nd place and it will take something dramatic for them even with the players they are missing to not amass those few points.,Championship,cgh4cfs,2,t5_2t0f0

Do I want us to be there of course at the same time our lack of experience in winning and closing out games is killing us.
