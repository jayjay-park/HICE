433968,0,t1_cfpqlqy,Im sorry to hear your father is a Greens voter.I was being somewhat sarcastic but obviously that part was missed.Seeing as the Greens more or less want to clamp down on firearm ownership your dad seems kind to go against what Ive encountered with Farmers and gun owners.,Ausguns,cfpquop,2,t5_2x1rv
479698,0,t1_cfuog2s,The action is a bit rough. Ive been cycling the bolt a bit and it seems to loosen it up. Not too bad but its nowhere near as smooth as the tikka action. ,Ausguns,cfusmd9,2,t5_2x1rv
1384678,0,t3_22vs82,It looks like a cast lead wadcutter  used for target shooting as they are accurate over competition distances and leave a nice clean hole instead of a star shaped rip.,Ausguns,cipuows,1,t5_2x1rv
1867607,0,t3_2fsuia,Not at all. Once a cat d always a cat d.You take an FAL and give it the barrel out of a . hunting rifle no gas port throw the gas piston and all related parts into the fires of mount doom and then fill up the holes where the gas system would go with molten steel thus modifying the weapon into a straight pull only rifle it would still be cat d because john howard is a cunt tim fischer is a cunt and rob borbidge is a cunt.,Ausguns,cke8nxs,4,t5_2x1rv

3753337,0,t3_33daif,Are you planning to live here yeah? An aussie citizen  licenced firearms holder can import guns from overseas but its a very expensive and time consuming process. Which state are you going to be in? We only did a few imports for customers just due to the sheer fuckery of the system. ,Ausguns,cqk3vld,4,t5_2x1rv
5177787,0,t1_cuv8wj9,Versus a couple of sad submissions from the likes of SSAA and other bodies essentially saying  you shouldnt have done the NFA in the first place and  please pretty please dont regulate us any more.I get the desire to keep the crazy submissions away from the discerning and sensitive eyes of regulators but there is some value in sheer number of submissions being sent in public review or not.  If nothing else Catherine Smith will have her work cut out for her replying to the fondlers in the remainder of her time in the role as Secretary overseeing this area. And that makes me happy.,Ausguns,cva430h,1,t5_2x1rv
6631581,0,t1_d053zzo,Small steps Im all for registered shooters being able to buy anything they want guns themselves arent registered and CCWDGU but in Australia we have no gun culture at all. If all gun laws disappeared tomorrow every criminal in the country would arm themselves but struggling single mum couldnt justify spending k on a handgun and the time to train. Thus there would be an imbalance of power. What needs to happen in this country is a slow but gradually loosening of the gun laws not an overnight collapse.,Ausguns,d059gu1,1,t5_2x1rv

7792864,0,t1_d3rrbfi,No we should only ban guns for civilians. Guns are necessary for the army and police to have  how else would the government ensure control over the population?,Ausguns,d3rz4zi,2,t5_2x1rv
7965175,0,t1_d4ae71n,This is legal in QLD provided they have the same license conditions as you. Obviously you need to notify weapons licensing you are storing firearms there.,Ausguns,d4bd0u6,4,t5_2x1rv

10873623,0,t1_de0hatw,When in reality it probably goes down as the government telling the greens to let us bag you publicly but give us your votes and we will do what you want and say it was our idea. ,Ausguns,de1jc54,3,t5_2x1rv
