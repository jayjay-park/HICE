4102235,0,t1_crnvnmr,ampampamp Kopi Luwak sfw gtgtKopi luwak Indonesian pronunciationkopi lu.a or civet coffee refers to the seeds of coffee berries once they have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet Paradoxurus hermaphroditus.  The name is also used for marketing brewed coffee made from the beans.gtProducers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms selection and digestion. Selection occurs if the civets choose to eat coffee berries containing better beans. Digestive mechanisms may improve the flavor profile of the coffee beans that have been eaten. The civet eats the berries for the beans fleshy pulp then in the digestive tract fermentation occurs. The civets Protease enzymes seep into the beans making shorter peptides and more free amino acids  Passing through a civets intestines the beans are then defecated with other fecal matter and collected.gtThe traditional method of collecting feces from wild civets has given way to intensive farming methods in which civets in battery cage systems are force fed the coffee beans. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets due to horrific conditions including isolation poor diet small cages and a high mortality rate.   A  BBC investigation of intensive civet farming in Sumatra found conditions of animal cruelty.  Intensive farming is also criticised by traditional farmers because the civets do not select what they eat so the beans are of poor quality compared to beans collected from the wild.  According to an officer from the TRAFFIC conservation programme the trade in civets to make kopi luwak may constitute a significant threat to wild civet populations. gtgtImage i  Sumatran kopi luwak farmer holds civet feces with embedded coffee beans.

And if you get a yeast infection you must let it overcome your vagina instead of using medicine to kill such emotive sweet creatures.  If youre a man just wait. After youve eaten enough soy your penis will invert itself and become a vagina. Thats why you almost never see male vegans. Lysol is not vegan because it kills precious microorganisms that a feel pain b have families that will miss them and c give us our only source of B. Clean your counters with your tongue for maximum B to stave off the inevitable neurological illeffects of veganism for just a bit longer. Laptops are not vegan because humans are animals poorly paid and treated animals in sweatshops making your vile bloodelectronics.  True vegans only use library computers and live under library benches and eat out of the garbage cans outside keeping halfeaten hamburgers out of Mother Earths landfills and not letting the cows die in vain. Freeganism is best veganism. The best vegan test is to pinch your upper arm. If you can pinch any amount of muscle you are not vegan enough to have completely wasted away into a shriveled husk from lack of nutrients. Vegan harder. Duh thats why he knew what its like to be a creep and weirdo. Vegans are the most oppressed group in history.

11614273,0,t1_dgcb8dl,The nurse told you to stop supplementing because then you can see your B levels fall and confirm that supplementation is the cause for your high B levels and then you can restart a regimen that will not cause high B again.High blood levels of B can be a marker for very serious lifethreatening diseases that must be treated as soon as possible. By oversupplementing and increasing your B blood levels to this range that is used as a marker for serious diseases it can delay your treatment if you do indeed have an organ disease that requires prompt treatment. You cant tell if the high B is because of supplementing or because of disease. So it is best to keep your blood B levels at a moderate level so that your doctor can better determine if a future B spike is due to supplements or the first sign of liver cirrhosis.The safety of ingesting high B doses doesnt really seem controversial. It seems pretty harmless. But that is a totally different topic than high level of B in the blood which are used as a marker for early detection of lifethreatening diseases. gtThe aetiological profile of high serum cobalamin predominantly encompasses severe disease entities for which early diagnosis is critical for prognosis. These entities are essentially comprised of solid neoplasms haematological malignancies and liver and kidney diseases. Dont complicate matters by oversupplementing.,vegancirclejerk,dgchkmh,5,t5_2sgfh
