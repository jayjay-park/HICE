2268144,0,t1_cls1v29,I know this is a bit of a tangent but its interesting to find someone else just as interested in darker moments of history.I cant say I recommend it because some people are highly sensitive when it comes to certain things but there are some audio recordings out there of the final meeting when people are taking the poison. You hear Jones preaching and talking and in the background you hear the panic fear  cries children etc.You can do a google search and find it.I tend to not mind listeningwatching horrible things because I feel that isolating myself from certain things leads to a compartmentalization of reality. Im also a fan of history and this is a piece of history.Its horrible. Absolutely horrible. But when you know how something like this ends you can be more sensitive and alert to how it begins to try and keep it from happening again.,boardsofcanada,cls2999,1,t5_2rres

5473804,0,t1_cwavn7b,Ill critique your critique as a longtime listener of all sorts of music. What you identify as weaknesses in the song I see as strengths. The textural atmospheric introduction sets a particular somber tone that the brightly coloured melody neatly reversed. That rapid shift in tone is mirrored in the final moments where the melody drops off seemingly in mid phrase as if something is being left unsaid. There are some interesting dynamics to these unexpected turns. If your appreciation of music is limited to songs that follow tired conventions of structure and melody youre not really listening to music as music youre just waiting to have your expectations met. ,boardsofcanada,cwbbvv4,2,t5_2rres

11592853,0,t3_65d8zu,This is one of my favorite BoC tunes and one of the first ones that really clicked for me and made me appreciate their music. The repeating woodwind phrase gives off a spinning out of control type vibe that is very vivid and surprisingly pleasant and the voicelike synthsample weaving around the soundscape just says so much on an emotional level I cant really describe it. The percussion is amazing throughout as well I especially always look forward to the snare roll  ensuing snippet at  it just feels like a cathartic release of tension. The first half of the track is BoC at their best I dont completely feel the same about the second half but it is there for a reason. The segment has grown on me over time where now Im not entirely annoyed that its there but it doesnt do much for me if the track comes on shuffle and Im just listening to Rue The Whirl and another unrelated tune comes on after. In the context of MHTRTC though I feel like the second half of this track is the perfect lead into Aquarius following the chaotic first half. Rue The Whirl to me sort of embodies a strong drug trip the first half being chaos and the second half being a sobering comedown. ,boardsofcanada,dga23p3,4,t5_2rres
