3269855,0,t3_2v6bp1,This guy claims to teach JKD but the Web site makes him look like a bit of a nutbar.The head instructor at Extreme Thai Boxing Academy appears to have a reasonably extensive JKD background it would be my first choice in your shoes.,jkd,cp0znkn,1,t5_2rtfk
5763426,0,t1_cu5q26g,So i just got back to this post after  months. I dont know how my question devolved into a post about Jiujitsu bashing. I dont want to make this another BJJ vs post  but id recommend training with wrestlers or good grapplers before assuming all of our takedown attempts can be nuked a swift elbow to the head. Seems like more people would do it if it were that easy and if your head is in elbowing range then youre shot was screwed up in the first place.Im a BJJ guy. Our school teaches JKD which I kind of like but just had this question regarding it. I like the hand techniques the philipino stuff and the Kali in it.  Even still there are a lot of assumptions made here that arent born from any pragmatic study of the art. ,jkd,cxbi8t8,1,t5_2rtfk
