8585594,0,t1_d6dw269,About in game time this game has two of them. One is shown after your complete a chapter. What exactly this timer stops and what not i dont know. I know it stops when you open pauseinventory menu. Beside that. Even when you cut out all the loading screens. I dont think you wouldnt get close to the time that this timer is showing.The second timer is in the Leaderboards. This timer has around  minutes difference to my Timer you see in the video. So it would be h min or so. I cant say it because i was playing offline. Despite that i prefer to use an external timer. It makes things easier when you want compare times. Instead of using the in game timer where you cant say. Who is the fastestcoughPokemon speedrunscough. Which gets us to the last part the Leaderboards. Until now i never really understood how the leaderboards are working. There are  places on this board but when you look on them you can easily say this are not the  best player. My theory is that. After  people finishing the game the leaderboard is full. So when now the  person finished the game. The first person that has finished the game gets delete from the board. So you have always  people on the leaderboard. But only the last  people that actually beaten the game. Or when you log back in with a finished file. Thats also an option.,DeadlyPremonition,d6esbys,1,t5_2soz0
