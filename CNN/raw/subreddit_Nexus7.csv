Due to wear leveling the controller translates logical block positions and its completely unaware which blocks are free of not. So once you write GB in total to your device the controller will start to churn the device by running readerasewrite cycles instead of simply writing to the flash.Run this in a terminal emulator as root     fstrim v dataIt will trim the data mount point. You can repeat it for other mount points in your root filesystem like  system or cache.Im not sure where sdcard is mounted I no longer have a N but if it isnt bind mounted to data you may have to run fstrim on it as well.,Nexus7,cfdidy1,7,t5_2ucrx

After a factory reset it seems to work again but stops rotating after a week or so. I tried Google support but they wouldnt help me because I bought the device through Amazon. If you got yours through the Google store Id recommend calling them and see if theyd give you a replacement since it should still be in warranty.

Keep in mind this will delete everything on the device. . Install Wugs Nexus Rootkit Dont worry you dont have to root if you dont want to. The toolkit is just the easiest way to remotely reflash your phone. It will save you from having to figure out installing drivers fastboot commands etc by yourself. Youll just be clicking buttons and following very clear instructions. . Once you have the toolkit set up click on driver installation and just follow the steps. . Now you might have to click unlock bootloader. Im not sure if this is actually necessary to flash a stock ROM hopefully someone else can answer this. . Click flash stock  unroot with softbrickedbootloop selected. Follow the instructions. . Now you should have a fully functional device again! If you unlocked the bootloader before if you want you can relock it with oem lock but it doesnt really matter. ,Nexus7,cgdznkv,1,t5_2ucrx

4746343,0,t3_3fwyc1,Hi Whitehat!The  is the Nexus  one the left in this photoLollipop can run just fine on the  Nexus  Im just not sure what you mean when you say business use but for an everyday tablet its a great value.  I wrote a guide that can help you coax more performance out of the Nexus  and its hereThat may help you if you do get the tablet.  Do you know if it how much storage memory it has?  There were   and GB models of the Nexus .  Obviously the more the better.  If it was an GB Id pass and go for another tablet.Jim,Nexus7,ctstkyq,0,t5_2ucrx

4843423,0,t1_cu500ud,This. My charging port went on the blink after it became too loose to charge.Purchased a wireless qi charger and I havent looked back. Cost less than  and as an added bonus I can charge my Nexus  with it. Sure it charges less quickly than a cable does and it makes the tablet hard to use whilst charging due to the lower output of the pad but you can avoid that issue by simply placing your tablet on charge during the night. All in all a great investment.,Nexus7,cu51taz,2,t5_2ucrx

6518179,0,t1_czti7ov,I dont actually think it was a mechanical thing. It happened right with whatever the last security update was.Apparently the software takes some reading from the USB port and if it doesnt like what it sees it will either draw a much smaller amount of current or not recognize that Its plugged in at all. And rapidly plugging and unplugging it resets whatever it uses to measure that.So Im guessing that the update affected that measurement somehow.Anyway thats what some guy said on the internet. That Im now probably incorrectly repeating.,Nexus7,cztj3wg,2,t5_2ucrx
