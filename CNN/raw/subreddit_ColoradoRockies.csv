One would need to look at each hit to see where exactly it landed and compare it to other fields. Once again however you cannot blame Tulo or any other Rockies fan for being prodigious hitters at a hitters field without simultaniously noting that good pitching is also the result of pitching at a pitchers park.For example Kershaws ERA inflates from . to .. Kershaw is still a great pitcher dont get me wrong but his home field helps him. Davishs only inflates . when he is away from Arlington. But it still increases. ,ColoradoRockies,chohb81,3,t5_2s3x4

3421013,0,t1_cphl8ke,Glad you liked it.In ESPNs ranking of the analytics systems the Rockies ranked low under ODowd and Geivett but part of it is how blackboxed everything is and the poor winloss record so its hard to know what they do use. The authors of the ranking also spoke highly of Rosenthal as have several other people. One thing that was different between this years panel and last year was there was more discussion of subtle things altitude wasnt the default excuse that only subtle adjustments were needed and that talent plays anywhere. These are the kinds of things echoed by national analysts like Carleton and Keri but that the Rockies never really outright said before.Its very hard to tell what over the last five years or so can be credited or blamed on ODowdGeivettBridichRosenthal. But I can definitely say that there is a new openness in the front office. Even in the past when rationales were given such as Geivett saying We got Morneau Hawkins and Logan because we wanted playoff experience. there was a rationale that was executed.Some might question how well the Rockies execute and especially in  when the roster moves didnt align with the ingame roster usage there seemed to be a bit of a throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks mentality. But there was still a method to the spaghetti being thrown.So thats a roundabout way of saying that I think Rosenthal is confident in what he is talking about. Hopefully the new front office is more streamlined communicationwise so well get to see how well their plan is being executed. This is the best Rockies farm system weve ever seen which should be a feather in both Bridichs and Rosenthals cap. The Rockies should do better recordwise in . The key time will come around the trade deadline and whether the Rockies blow things up if they are doing poorly or break tradition and add a piece if theyre on the cusp of the wild card. If they unjustifably stand pat then the trust issue would come back up though it would be the front officeownership as a whole.,ColoradoRockies,cpi7y19,1,t5_2s3x4

I doubt this can be sustained. The  starts at coors our pitchers have been awful. The bullpen has been great this year. But I still believe this is a throw away season and were trying to up the trade value for some guys. Im very optimistic about the next  years but right now were a  win team. C Dick and arenado are gonna be superstars. But theyre not there yet. Gray and butler are gonna be our  with freeland and lyles being our  and Tyler Anderson or chatwood being our th starter. If were not close to . by the all star break I believe were gonna move tulo and cargo.  It sucks but its ridiculous to pay  million on a guy when your continuously at the bottom of the division. When you see a top team underperform like this they have a fire sale and trade every player away. Look at the Red Sox in . Or last year. They finished last place in the division and got rid of everyone. And got some guys back that helped them win a championship in . Its how this shit works.

11497426,0,t1_dfyvcbz,Heres my thought this was in Atlanta. Everywhere they go they get kids screaming at him to throw them the balls he catches in BP. On the road they have no clue who these relief pitcher guys are so they just scream and scream and it probably annoys them. Motte seems like the kind of guy that would just get so annoyed by the kids screaming at him that he would take the ball and just say You want this? Go fetch. Kind of a dick move. Then again Motte seems like kind of a dick. ,ColoradoRockies,dfz8e31,1,t5_2s3x4
