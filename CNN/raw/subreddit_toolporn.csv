4706999,0,t1_ctnkxsk,I work with a couple guys who use their new V tools in an industrial HVAC installation environment and theyve held up just fine over a few years. Anecdotally Ive seen MORE Milwaukee drills fail and our local tool shop says his return rate on the DeWalts is lowest. Again not saying thats conclusive proof just that its unfair to call DeWalt trash. ,toolporn,ctnusgu,1,t5_2syvg

10218713,0,t1_dc2c7nm,I wanted to try out the cutter to make sure that it functioned without issue before I needed it in the field. I spent all of  on the cheapest filter I could find. My personal vehicle has cartridge filters so the only used filters I would have access to are planes in the field and I wanted to make sure it worked before I got to that point. ,toolporn,dc2ckdz,6,t5_2syvg

10310485,0,t1_dccp4y3,It wasnt subsidized per se but the US government decided to sell off its HUGE stockpiles that it had around due to the WWII think airships. Because the US wasnt planning to bomb ze germanz from giant balloons anymore it decided to just sell it all off so the prices became dirt cheap. Apparently once those reserves are diminished enough the prices should jump. They were even looking to make it for government use only back in  but I guess that flopped as well. ,toolporn,dccqzpo,1,t5_2syvg

11195048,0,t1_df0xd96,Thank you.  That Amazon link does not look like what I see in the OP photo.  The photo above appears to be a soft material possibly foam.  Maybe its homemade.The Amazon link appears to be hard plastic and clearly has compartments for labels and other stuff washers smaller wretches.  Thats not what I see in the original photo.  I dont think they are the same thing.Thank you for the link.,toolporn,df0y1gr,1,t5_2syvg
11239075,0,t1_df5uy2q,Ive grew up and noticed most of the people around here had there dewalt tools forever and I try and by stuff to last. I am pretty gentle with my tools most of the time but I know that impact driver was the best and favorite tool purchases. Use it all the time for driving screw but I have also taken wheels off and took apart a ford . almost completely with just that think... very impressive so far. ,toolporn,df5xld8,2,t5_2syvg
