This attack can be used to sign a message when a MerkleDamgrd based hash is misused as a message authentication code allowing for inclusion of extra information.This attack can be done on hashes with construction Hsecret  message when message and the length of secret is known. Algorithms like MD SHA and SHA that are based on the MerkleDamgrd construction are susceptible to this kind of attack,bitcoin_unmoderated,daia4ea,1,t5_39sqg
