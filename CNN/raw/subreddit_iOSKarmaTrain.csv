397101,0,t1_cflx7ps,Thanks! One more thing that im not sure about is rotation on things like gifs and pictures. When i open a gif or picture and rotate my phone is there a way to have the image rotate aswell?,iOSKarmaTrain,cflxbq7,1,t5_2zfq9
397231,0,t3_1yij2r,Downloaded the app based on your post in rapple and have to say I like it very much so far. Ill use it exclusively for a while and see what additional suggestions I have but the first things I miss from Alien Blue are Night Mode and the Go to Subreddit features. Other than those Im liking it a lot.  Good job!!!,iOSKarmaTrain,cflxt7l,1,t5_2zfq9
4411620,0,t3_3bf36o,Thank you for doing this! Bought the pro version to help support your efforts just a little bit. Couple more suggestions Ability to follow r links to the subreddit by clicking on it.  Persistent textheadings on imgur album photos. e.g. On rdiy therell be a succession of images with descriptive text currently have to swipe to the next photo tap the photo and then keep tapping it each time the text times out.  True night mode with a darker background that grey so the off white text is more distinguished and visible. Adjunctive to this custom colour schemes?   Flairs. Image Flairs and ability to chooseedit flair for a subreddit in app.  Persistent login. Often get the Logging In float over box when I switch back to the app or open it up freshly.  Any way to stop the image from any NSFW marked posts from displaying as you scroll through the subredditfront page? Keep up the good work. Would love to donate more if theres a way to do that and youre interested. Thanks ,iOSKarmaTrain,csmxa6m,1,t5_2zfq9
