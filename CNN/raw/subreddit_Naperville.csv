418457,0,t1_cfo2yse,Thats a good distance from the train station and passes some really busy roads on the way. Probably not too bad during warmer months but tricky with snow on the ground. Also thats all industrialoffice parks in that area so shouldnt be an issue to find a place to lock up the bike maybe even ask if you can bring the bike into the building. ,Naperville,cfo50bi,1,t5_2slq6

5059318,0,t3_3k7aei,Im in. Bavarian Lodge and Solemn Oath are my recs for starting points. Ballydoyle too if it ever opens in Naperville otherwise roadtrip to Downers Grove or Aurora BNSF train will get you to either. Come to think of it Two Brothers Roundhouse is at the Aurora train platform. Theres lots to explore consume there.,Naperville,cuvu7gu,3,t5_2slq6

6827785,0,t3_49a66j,You really wont be in the heart of naperville if you live there.. it will be a hike to get downtown to enjoy what the city has to offer. And that area of naperville is not considered the best.. crime is a bit higher which for naperville still means pretty much hardly any more apartments less homes etc.. so it is priced accordingly.Unless you technically need to be in naperville you could look at other communities nearby that might be appealing and priced the same.Not sure what you are looking for... in town? lots of parks?  schools important?,Naperville,d0q89jw,2,t5_2slq6

11641469,0,t1_dgfhvxm,Thats the same shit people in the South used to say to explain away segregation instead of fighting against it. You may be okay with the way Napervillians act towards minorities but people like myself fight against it instead of rolling over.  You should be outraged instead of shrugging it off ,Naperville,dgfkoc7,0,t5_2slq6
11652458,0,t1_dgf9glh,Thanks. I currently only have time for improv once a week. And Im not yet ready to perform for paying customers. Open Improv is a great way for me to practice and get better without the pressure.,Naperville,dggtjru,1,t5_2slq6
