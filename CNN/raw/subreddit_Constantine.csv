2261563,0,t3_2kxw8b,Im not really feeling this episode. As a monster of the week drama it seems ok but as a show based on Hellblazer it seems kind of weak. Seeing John sneaking around in his trench coat and fighting miners felt out of character to me. ,Constantine,clr8zs6,4,t5_2viio

2847008,0,t1_cnrkmot,As someone else has said but to clarify The ritual is probably irrelevant. It is the faith of the exorcist that is what is important.If one wanted to assign strengths I suspect someone in a dualist religion like Catholocism is better able to cast out demons. It is all black and white to them. However someone like Papa Midnight is probably better at controlling directiong or coercing demons. The more shades of grey might lower your ability to banish but it lends you more choices.Even now in the Hellblazer setting I am not sure if they have said which is greater.,Constantine,cnrpd1e,11,t5_2viio

2921093,0,t3_2tksm5,ok OP after a lengthy google search the tattoos are an assembly of different symbols and chants from different grimores.Mostly containing stuff from the VERUS JESUITARVM LIBELLUS The True Petition of the Jesuits. basically its commanding the entity to bring the user wealth or gold against its will mind yougt And by the words by which Solomon Manasses Agrippa and Cyprian commingled with the spirits and even as Jesus Christ sent out his spirit delivering it up into the hands of his heavenly Father so do I command you that you appear without delay and come before me in a most beautiful affable and human form and bring to me from the depths of the seas N. million of the best Spanish goldit also has lines to conjure Usiel a fallen angel from the bible who married and had kids with mortals which was a big no no and god stripped him of his wings and he became part of lucifers legion of fallen angel generalsgt Listen O Usiel! I N. an unworthy servant of God conjure demand conquer and call you O Spirit Usiel! not by my power but by the might virtue and power of God  the Father and by the complete redemption and salvation of God  the Son and by the might and victory of God  the Holy Spirit and by the strength of these most potent wordsTLDR Basically the tattoos allow the user to control spirits and summon one fallen angeledit  I went nuts trying to find the center piece circle with the cross in it but i havent turned up any leads but interestingly enough its behind the show title in the intro,Constantine,co04y78,10,t5_2viio

3051964,0,t3_2uxp06,Just my own interpretation but I saw it as the place was Shaws construction.  Ritchie altered it but it was Shaws territory.  With Shaw gone it was only held up by Ritchie mentally holding it.  When Ritchie left that world collapsed. He couldnt pop out for an hour then go back in again.As for leaving Ritchie there the idea was that Ritchie would lose his sanity very quickly.  He could stayand keep the world in place but hed quickly become at worst like Shaw or at best too insane to enjoy it .Ritchie was in a couple of the planned late season episodes so plotwise they needed to keep him around anyway.,Constantine,coec1ix,2,t5_2viio
3056563,0,t1_coegksh,Yeah its pretty wide consensus that the rising darkness thing is a big stumbling block for Constantine. This weeks episode was fantastic and had some great character development. The past few weeks have been great too. But the fact that the rising darkness is sort of abstract and faceless with the whole brujeria thing being a really really weak plot device to tie things together week to week.I hope they keep the show. Everything else about it is fantastic. The casting is pretty spot on and I love Matt Ryan,Constantine,coet6sr,1,t5_2viio

3133912,0,t3_2vy8ad,The thing that has me worried though is that the DC movie machine is trying to put together a Justice League Dark movie.

3164404,0,t1_cop8961,Thats exactly what I was thinking. Oh and Zed would fall in and out of lust with Constantine every few weeks depending on how emotionally available he seemed that day. The mill would be a loft built into an old warehouse. Arrow and Flash have been great this year but the idea of Hellblazer Smallville makes me cringe. And Arrow and Flash still have some of that old Smallville DNA. It seems like the showrunners are succeeding in spite of their network. ,Constantine,copzmli,1,t5_2viio
