Its an episodic game kind of like The Walking Dead so watching a video of it will ruin the experience because it wont be your choices. Half of the experience is not knowing what choice to make and going along with your feelings. But if youre not going to play it at all well yeah at least watch it.,XenoGears,ctgym3l,1,t5_2t2ty

Xenosaga and Xenoblade!Also  Virtues Last Reward Steins Gate Full Metal Alchemist   definitely makes me think about many things each time I watch it moreso then its remake brotherhood  Over The Garden Wall a cartoon with more depth then you may initially think.  Thats what I found off the top of my head though there is much more that I could recommend.,XenoGears,cvk7mqf,1,t5_2t2ty
6386639,0,t1_czegs36,Problem is Square doesnt care about Xenogears.  They didnt care about it when they were allowing it to be developed so they certainly wont care about it  years later.  The only thing they did care about was then they told Takahashi that he could continue the Xenogears story as Xenosaga right up until he went to Namco to get it published.  Then they suddenly cared about it enough to file a lawsuit and claim the Xenogears IP was theirs and Namco wasnt allowed to make it.  Then back on the shelf it went to be forgotten about.Xenogears came out in the s when games were still made because people were passionate about them and wanted to tell a story.  Today games get made based on projected sales figures and how much of a return it will bring the publishers.  Sadly I dont see Square deciding that Xenogears will profitable enough to even port it.,XenoGears,czflefz,1,t5_2t2ty

7231734,0,t3_4e9lul,Nintendo could fund the development with Monolith Soft handling the development since a lot of the old development team joined Takahashis company...  kind of like how Nintendo saved the Bayonetta franchise since Sega didnt want to fund the sequel.  Although then it would probably then be an NX exclusive after making a deal with Square Enix... I wouldnt mind that but it would be nice if Nintendo published it for multiple platforms as Id love to play it on PC. Nintendo does sometimes publish Square Enix games at least in North America like Bravely Default... but hasnt published any games for nonNintendo systems since the NES era besides Miitomo on iOS.  It would nice if it were a crossplatform where Nintendo and Square Enix split the revenue somehow but Id still be okay with a Nintendo exclusive if there was no chance of a remake being made without the help of Nintendo and Takahashis Monolith Soft.  At least Nintendo would give Takahashi the amount of time and money to complete the game properly like they did with Xenoblade Chronicles.  Only thing Id be concerned about it though with it in Nintendos hand would be censorship of religious themes and maybe some of the more adult themes during the localization since it would probably be rated T.  If it were rated M then there would be minimal censorship during localization.  Otherwise... I guess I will just have to learn Japanese and play the Japanese version.,XenoGears,d20714v,1,t5_2t2ty
