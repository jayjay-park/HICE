156641,0,t3_1uw4mz,Going forward GPT is superior. Although some buggy BIOSs like my ASUS XE wont recognise GPT as a bootable partition. The Legacy boot compatability mode dosent work for GPT.As for logical MBR partitions. Its not really necessary since BSD labels have the same effect as logical partitions. BSD slices are a soft partitioning within a MBR partition. Or you can skip out the MBR partition altogether.I cant say Ive tried using BSD slices inside a logcial MBR partition. Dont know if its possible. So if you need a lot of partitions with other OSsFSs perhaps GPT is the way to go.,freebsd,cew9u6j,1,t5_2qi1e

957064,0,t1_chd1bwb,Just use FreeBSD and learn how to configure it. Seriously the first time might take you a bit but its not THAT hard and once you do it once youll have your config files.side note hard being relative to how comfortable you are in a console ssh terminal and text editors.On anything resembling supported hardware there are about  thing you have to do to get up an running. install the OS. FreeBSD  install with a zfs root is dead simple. set a root password. add a regular user. setup etcrc.conf and etcsystcl.conf for your networking. read up on how to make a gateway. Basically  NICs a default or DHCP enabled default and then enable packet passing in sysctl.conf enable ssh and pf in etcrc.conf edit etcpf.conf  . grab the dafault  example one from usrshareexamplesetcpf.conf  Calomel has some of the best howtos for BSD around.This is all from memory but once you do it once or twice it really isnt that hard.

3463846,0,t3_2zx3tr,Thanks for the response.  I did read that.  The mainboard an ASUS MALTM has an integrated Radeon  GPU and a VIA Audio chipset.  They are disabled in the bios for a few years since I bought the PCIE .  However it I enable them the VIA does show up with the external SPDIF and Jack connections.  I just only have the one cable running from PC to tv monitor.  It expects audio over hdmi when I select this source.  The only way I think I could use external audio is if I switched to a traditional vga connector so its not really viable for me.  I dont know what the issue is with my card.  I have seen other posts detailing different issues but it seems they still get the hdmi PCM and usually it is configuration to switch the default.  In my case the sound is not detected.  dmesg pciconf and devinfo are all attached at that freebsd forum thread.

6495888,0,t1_czr5yeb,gt Okay yeah they cant guarantee  backports since there are possible circumstances in which it wouldnt be possible. In such instances in the past Red Hat has upped the minor version number to a point where they could continue backporting security fixes yet config language etc remains the same.Yeah no. Thats not how it works. That presumes the minor doesnt break your application which is real unlikely. That also presumes the vendor isnt going to say .? NO. We only support .! All of these assumptions are completely wrong and thats always been the case. Ive been doing this a very long time and Red Hat remains without exception the biggest goddamn support headache next to Oracle. Go ahead try getting support for say .  see how long it takes them to tell you YOU NEED TO UPGRADE TO  ignoring the fact that its a reinstall. That is also their first response when there are issues with .xgt. updates. Config language etc remains the same is also untrue. They can and do change within minor releases. Which you as a customer are required to update to in order to receive support. Whether or not they minimize the changes doesnt change that they do happen. Or as with the subscription management and Satellite changes they decide to blow the whole thing up with zero compatibility. My favorite is how Satellite was Red Hat Database and then embedded Oracle and then PostgreSQL  all within minor releases. Plus completely breaking virtually everything else with massive regressions on a regular basis. Just what I want in my enterprise software and configuration management solution especially the part where they decided it wasnt configuration management any more! And then it was again!gt Okay. Youre pretty much completely wrong friend. Im sorry youre apparently so angry about this. Im not knocking FreeBSD.The very idea of expecting people who primarily repackage free software from thirdparties to provide a  year enterprise lifecycle is idiotic. Red Hat can and does dictate some decisions by fiat see also systemd but they dont own the bulk of the software they distribute. Which is why their first copout excuse is always well thats upstream. And people expect them to maintain a  year life cycle and provide effective support on something they dont actually control? Thats just pure delusion.bind . update? Uh. No. Thats just flat out false. There was a bind . errata recently. The fix actually came from ISC. Its also not available without EUSELS. Certain other updates that constantly pop up like Java are always upstream provided. At DAYJOB there are people who are dedicated to building packages and patchsets for dozens of vulnerabilities that Red Hat either didnt fix or wont fix because there is a workaround. You think anyone wants to spend that money? Hell no.FreeBSD can maintain the lifecycle they do because they do control everything in base. Nothing in base is dependent on some thirdparty continuing to develop and maintain it out of the goodness of their hearts. Anything that was is optional or gets yanked see also bind. Thats why intelligent people use it as the basis for their commercial products  JunOS is now tracking .x in highend platforms. They can build their stuff on top of it and they know that its capable of sticking to the stated lifecycle regardless of any components they slap on top.,freebsd,czr8143,4,t5_2qi1e

6565818,0,t1_czyeyjs,With four disks the best compromise between reliability and performance is a striped pair of mirrors sometimes called RAID  which is what you get if you select a mirror with the first two disks during installation then add the other two as a mirror vdev later     zpool add zroot mirror devada devadaThe vdevs wont be the same size but that doesnt matter for a striped pool.If you want to get fancy you can ask the installer to create a fourway mirror then detach two of the members and reattach them as a separate vdev.

11582400,0,t3_657e9g,From reading their documentation FreeNAS is a FreeBSD with a GUI interface to some services samba sharing services directory services etc.The main benefit seems to be the relatively easytouse web interface for initial configuration of the hardware.The negative side is that in order to make it simple to some users FreeNAS imposes additional layers on top of the OS making it difficult to customise and tailor more sophisticated needs.For example a fileserver is usually configured just once. If done properly the configuration will hardly change. To me the additional GUI overlay seems taking an excessive toll for what it offers.If one already has some FreeBSD experience it will be more fruitful and more stable to just employ FreeBSD and install samba and any other services as needed.For that nothing is better than just taking your time and read the FreeBSD Handbook. There may be some tutorial around too if you like a different kind of writing.Of course FreeNAS is also targeting inexperienced home users that do not wish to take time to learn a sophisticated tool like a NAS. Then FreeNAS offer a simpler clickandgo platform. But it has a price to pay ie it abstracts you away from the solid FreeBSD foundations.,freebsd,dg8vedb,2,t5_2qi1e
