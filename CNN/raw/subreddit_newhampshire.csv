310544,0,t1_cfcy6ly,Now youre getting it  Government is the natural and inevitable progression of any organized human endeavor capable of wielding power over other humans.If we somehow scrap the government that exists now all that we trade it for is a more primitive and directly abusive form of government. Government that existed early in social development  simple dictatorships autocracies the like. Eventually those would fall and give rise to slightly more stable forms  fiefdoms swearing fealty to larger structures. Those too would eventually cave to internal pressure becoming gradually more egalitarian until once again humanity would end up with large highly stable representative forms of government.This has been my point all along  when people advocate for the abolition of government in favor of a pure capitalist system they are actually advocating for a return to exploitative dictatorships by way of monopoly. Government did not spring into existence separate from trade  government as a concept came about as a direct result of profit motive.,newhampshire,cfcyflv,0,t5_2rmnf

Most Quebeckers drive way over the speed limit in my experience but US plates may make you a target for the police so take it easy. I recommend trying both smoked meat and poutine up there.

We live in the middle of the woods on an acre parcel.  Here is what I have done while keeping within hygenic boundaries rerouted laundry line to discharge into a dry well on the side of my property bought  of these for our kitchen sink to eliminate debris OXO Good Grips Silicone Sink Strainer  low flow sink aerators  . bathroom and . kitchen Im pretty sure these numbers are correct low flow shower head  I just went from a . down to a . and Im waiting for a shipment of . heads to come from amazon for me to try I have my system pumped every spring   well spent vs k for a new system I am heavily considering a new toilet... i have American Standard .gpf toilets and am looking at dual action toilets that offer .  .gpf or even this one American Standard Cadet FloWise White .GPF  or of course you could always just put brinks in the tank.I have  upcoming projects that I plan on doing when the ground dries up a bit Rerouting my water softener line into the same line as the laundry line into the dry well digging a pit not a dry well in an area next to my leach field where I will line with landscape fabric and fill with large stones to create a place for water to gather as opposed to just soak the surface and flood my leach field.A few other things worth mentioning too...  Ive had my septic company water jet my leach field which resulted in a noticeable difference in draining.  I too would love to find my distribution box... but my attempts have not been successful either.  If you can find your dist box you can water jet your leach field down each arm.  I was only able to do one arm at the time. The girls of the house do not flush tampons but throw them away in a separate lined garbage can in the bathroom.   Scott ply toilet paper...  this is a major source of depression for me but you got to do what you got to do.  No ply here. Give up on the natural bacteria dissolving solids in your tank... if your household is any size like mine then the bacteria doesnt really have time to be affective and pumping every year pretty much eliminates this concern.  Regardless you should try to eliminate bleach if at all possible.  That kills bacteria more than anything.I am a B DIYer and am not affraid of getting my hands dirty.

Rules and regulations that theoretically the majority of constituents feel that everyone in society should adhere to. Law enforcement is there to enforce those rules and regulations not to help craft them beyond consultation about implementation issues. Its exactly like giving the military one of the loudest voices about who to go to war with and when. Please see WWI if you have any questions about the outcome of that scenario. The police are getting to decide who to arrest for how long and then get a massive influence on sentencing guidelines. Is it any surprise that theyre against changing laws that offer up lowhanging fruit to be arrested?   We need to stop being tough on criminals and start being tough on crime and its causes and Law Enforcement lobbying groups have come out again and again against such reform. ,newhampshire,coqpje8,3,t5_2rmnf

7481739,0,t3_4hc0dw,Unless you live in one of a handful of scattered NH towns Eversource is going to be the company physically bringing the electricity to you and maintaining the equipment and you will pay them their share approx half your bill for delivery. The part you can choose is your supplier which is the company that purchases your share of electricity from the grid and resells it to you. Many of these companies offer introductory rates below Eversource but you have to be careful because those rates can and often do drastically change after your initial  or  month contract. I have twice switched suppliers  to Electricity NH and North American Power  and both times ended up back with Eversource at renewal time. Eversources supply rates are loosely regulated by the state and only change a couple times per year whereas these other companies have more freedom.Another aspect of thirdparty suppliers that some people like is the ability to choose at an added cost of course to have your share of the electricity purchased from green sources whereas you would probably normally be receiving fossil fuel or nucleargenerated power.,newhampshire,d2smr33,1,t5_2rmnf

8714193,0,t1_d6uvdwm,Actually all of those bankruptcies are directly from Trump companies over a series of names.It started as Trump Hotels amp Casino Resorts founded by Trump. This company went through bankruptcy in . In  still under Trump it went through bankruptcy again and he stepped down as chairman maintaining a  stake hold at the time. Translation He was forced out of his own company for fucking up so hard.After that it renamed itself to Trump Entertainment Resorts. In  they went through bankruptcy again. Trump signed a deal where the company would be refinanced and hed be given a  stake and a further  for the use of his name. The final bankruptcy was in  admittedly nothing to do with Trumps leadership and it is now owned by Icahn Enterprises.The takeaway Trump founds a company in  leads it to bankruptcy within ten years then another bankruptcy ten years after that. This second bankruptcy forces him out of power and onto the board. Five years later hes brought down again to a  stake with a  licensing deal. In only  years he was able to go from founding the company to only having a  stake.Yep thats a successful businessman right there. I actually do research! Do you?

Eventually after not getting the primrose path gotcha moment you desire you post a rather innocent sounding just curious question. I ask for some clarification and you immediately hop into your confirmation bias chariot and begin imagining that Im swearing at you when to date Ive been rather direct and civil in my responses.I agree that we are a long way from a society that can fully avoid coercion and I am certainly willing to entertain pragmatic spending of the stolen money within the existing framework AND I am willing to discuss pragmatic spending of voluntary contributions.I suppose one great example of a potentially less harmful spending would be to personally offer to help pay for therapy to help  you resolve anger issues that you face on a day to day basis. While there can be many causes for this I fear from the irrational response above that you must have suffered severe mental or physical trauma as a child and if that is the case let me say I am honestly very sorry. You should know that there are people out here that do care about you and that violence and anger are not appropriate ways of interacting with people. I dont know if there is good data to back up effectiveness of things like talk therapy at helping people who may have been permanently damaged from such trauma but if there is evidence I am certainly willing to try to explore the effectiveness of such an approach.   Would you be willing to pursue therapy? If so how can I help? While I dont think I could shoulder all of the burden Id be willing to donate and coordinate a fundraiser if we can find a qualified therapist.At the very least I hope you are no longer in a situation where someone is currently doing you mental or physical harm.

10215193,0,t1_dc1q9bp,To your first point having a child is a choice and if you have any doubt about your employers abilitywillingness or obligations to you in regards to a pregnancy should be looked at before starting a family.gtWhy is okay for companies to treat employees that way?I disagree with your premise.  The fact that you chose an employer with unfavorable benefit options is your own fault as employment is a voluntary relationship.  The fact the situation is like that is either the employees fault for accepting the unfavorable terms or its their fault for not finding a better alternative.  If no alternative exists then by default the employer is offering the best possible option available to that employee.  If they werent surely the employee would take the better offer.If anything the employee should be grateful for the opportunity!gttreat him so poorly with no repercussions You sound very jaded and like somebody who has never had to run a business of any sort.,newhampshire,dc1y7fp,2,t5_2rmnf

11475785,0,t1_dfwlmh2,...ok sure Im part of that socialist minorityantiestablishment leftist strain that I identified in my first post. given that trump was much more of an antiestablishment candidate it makes sense he won So. NH given my characterization of it as ideologically varied except in resistance to said establishment. Also not sure what you mean by pretty consistently given that Obama carried Southern NH twice.other than that ucoldnhs post is spot on the Concord area is definitely more attuned to liberal as opposed to leftist politics than the rest of the state and small farms are super accessible here!edit also only recommending ManchNashua bc that seems to be where the DI jobs are located. you could definitely commute easily from a more rural area though! ,newhampshire,dfwrxyw,1,t5_2rmnf
11476002,0,t1_dfwshqd, Liberal means establishment centerleft usually wealthy Democrat. Think Barack Obama or someone who identifies with HuffPo. These individuals are entangled in the least coherent identity politics since they tend to be easily appeased by more symbolic reforms read gay marriage than legislation based on academic understandings of sexualitygender read Judith Butler. Youre right Im not using it to mean libertarian.Many antiestablishment leftists all people leftofcenter usually connotes being further left would identify as progressive often used interchangeably w liberal but a progressive should support antitrust or Teddy Rooseveltesque corporate regulations as opposed to the liberals who might oppose them through their wealthier interests read Nancy Pelosi were capitalists deal with it or socialist which Im not going to get into since youve already used the word dismissively.,newhampshire,dfwstus,1,t5_2rmnf
