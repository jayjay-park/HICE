4863171,0,t3_3hdrcg,My friend and I had a pretty small totem it was a teddy bear and then we added lights and glow sticks and other assorted paraphernalia throughout the weekend as we sourced them. It was a bit last minute unfortunately but I was pleasantly surprised by how many people came by and complimented us on it  played with it! That made me so happy that the bear got a lot of lovin even if small for its size  Thanks guys! ,summersetfest,cu7jfvg,1,t5_38rdu
