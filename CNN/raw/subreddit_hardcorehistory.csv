9050540,0,t3_545who,just started listening to HI  its a little different than HH more conversational and narrative driven but its wildly entertaining and covers a very wide range of topics both real world and fictional. The quality is a little rough but Ive really come to enjoy it. Id suggest the episodes covering the unification of Germany the origins of Russia Caribbean Piracy and the Knights Templar. Give it a shot. ,hardcorehistory,d7zqbk9,1,t5_2x19o
