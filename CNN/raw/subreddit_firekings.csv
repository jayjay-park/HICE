1626756,0,t1_cjg9h19,But the indirect support can be so good. In Duelist Alliance theres Archfiend Eater. Once you put it in the grave you can destroy Garunix or any of your other Fire King monsters every single opponents end phase letting you get off Garunix nukes even more often without wasting precious Circles and Generation Shifts.,firekings,cjk7uhi,2,t5_32llm

1827967,0,t3_2e4jsm,Main forbidden chalice for your own garunix to get over killer in an attack situation start maining Phoenix again to wipe the pendulum board clean tech Wicked Eraser run call of the haunted so you can pull out a rank  answer to killer.  There are ways to do this.,firekings,ck9gn0u,1,t5_32llm
1997223,0,t1_cktofxo,Thanks man can i see your build? For an idea of other ideas then what i have. Also i like decree for the fact that it can shut down a deck completely like ba. Any other cards i should know about to run in the main like flamvells?,firekings,cktv602,1,t5_32llm

4373078,0,t3_3b3cj4,If we could summon Barong pop him with Dark Hole immediately search Onslaught and have a Garunix with Circle live during Main Phase ...   As long as Barong remains with no Once Per Turn restriction as he is now we could have some very ridiculous plus plays just by play him destroy him garunix attack circle to barong attack gen shift to search and barong attack again next turn Garunix comes back pops barong search again immediately for a circle repeat next turn.It would MAYBE make us a Tier Three rogue deck though I still cant see that competing with Satellas or BA or Nekroz or anything since our infinite advantage would be limited to the card effect destruction of a single card while Nekroz have infinite searchability and recyclability BA and Shaddolls get sent to graveyard instead of destroyed by card effect and Satellas go  off of a Call of the Haunted and have Triverr to make them plus off of almost anything and reuse everything.,firekings,csikxpu,3,t5_32llm
4695257,0,t3_3f8bm9,I personally think its the most managable of the meta matchups. As a doll player myself I and probably most other doll players have no common maindeck cards that hurt. Crush Card? No. Ring? No. The only common maindeck cards that would stop the loop are Vanitys Emptiness and effect negation Vieler Breakthrough etc. Effect negation can be dodged by Circle as well.In my Doll side the only thing I have that would work is Vanitys Fiend to flat out stop the Garunix from even coming out. But in a deck that can easily run double Dark Hole along with Raigeki and TT its a fragile lock at best.I think the best way to win would be to just try to outresource them by subjecting them to a constant Garunix loop and protecting it with as much backrow as possible.,firekings,ctmdm1m,4,t5_32llm
5556127,0,t1_cwlqzst,Alright awesome. Were always happy to have new people and any videos on the deck are welcome. Everyones a little down right now because were just waiting for island to come out. ,firekings,cwlsei3,1,t5_32llm
