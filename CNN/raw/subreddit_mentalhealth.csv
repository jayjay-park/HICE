30084,0,t3_1ufnrb,Ive never been to therapy but I certainly spent much of my life isolating myself and believe I fixed myself through something like CBT. What I did was pick one thing. Then I smiled whenever I did it I killed my immediate reactionary thoughts about it and replaced them with good thoughts and finally I began to enjoy naturally whatever it was. My problem was selfimage and obviously I destroyed myself the more I shut myself away.  Eventually all of the little things added up and I was going out more standing up straighter complimenting others and being complimented in return.  Eventually all of that allowed me to stop being scared other people would hurt me so I could let them in.To be honest I also just got older and hormones died down as well.  Calmed me right down.,mentalhealth,cehuv7u,2,t5_2qirg
106546,0,t3_1vafhj,Ok I just want to add my voice to the people that are saying you need to call Child Protective ServicesDepartment of Children Services. To get that number just search on Google DCS and your states page should come up as the first result. Calls are anonymous as far as I know. They will not just take the girl out of her home that is the last resort in all occasions. What they will do is assess her home life to determine whether or not it is safe for her to remain there. They are trained better than anyone to assess that.    If you really dont think you can call DCS then talk to your aunt and uncle  getting custody of the little girl if they dont already have it and  kicking your sister out. If you cant do that go back to option .    All of what you described sounds exactly like Borderline Personality Disorder. She goes off when something doesnt go her way then feels guilty so that the people she blew up at still like her. She might not have control but that is only because she chose to give up her control of her behavior. You should feel angry for they way she is treating your family and her young daughter. No one deserves that abuse.    This is a hard situation because it is all family and I apologize if I sound in any way harsh. Ive seen people in situations like this many times and it always ends with someone getting hurtphysically or emotionallyand it is usually the child.,mentalhealth,ceqk8c5,1,t5_2qirg

858031,0,t3_23xts2,I am currently reading George Vaillants Adaptation to Life and I remembered an interesting page where he describes sociopaths he uses the word psychopath as slightly misunderstood.  Heres the page assuming the Google Books link works the same for everybody LinkA relevant quote The criminal who has escaped from jail twiceand has been imprisoned thricehas often facilitated his recapture.  He may even have had the slogan Born to lose painfully tattooed into his flesh before the cycle began yet people say he has no conscience.Now this passage is more about delinquency than the more romantic notion of the smooth suave sociopathic business leader.  Which of the two a person is is perhaps a matter of intelligence andor talent.Another interesting reading on this stuff is the psychodynamic theorist Karen Horneys take on what she calls the arrogantvindictive type.  The book its in Neurosis and Human Growth used to be available free on Scribd but it appears to be behind a paywall now or Id link you to the relevant chapter.But it is very fascinating.  She describes essentially conscienceless behavior but also describes the psychodynamic underpinnings of it.  Her conclusion after a long section describing this type of person in detail is that if you look at their external behavior you see a sadist but if you look at whats going on inside you see a harassed human being struggling for survival against his own inner demons basically.  Its a really fascinating read.,mentalhealth,ch1taad,1,t5_2qirg

I dont enjoy anything like i used to and even back in my teenage years i had doubts over how much i enjoyed music.

I dont even know how many hours are on offer if its less it wont be enough. What do i do then? Dont eat? Ive tried this way before.

When I got there all the patients warned me to switch to the other therapist there were two but she seemed so nice at the beginning.  There was one group with a man named Dr. John D and wed talk about different things every group drugs mental disorders feelings dreams but he didnt make it seem like he was just one of the staff he talked to us more like equals.  At the beginning of each group hed give up one of those mints with the mint on one side and a flavor on the other strawberry raspberry etc. and wed all close our eyes and just sit in complete silence.

You can choose to not be depressed. is absolutely false it is still possible to make a choice to try to improve your life and situation.Again this isnt about you or your situation. You clearly have been trying it takes a lot of tenacity to try again and again after so many disappointments.So OP keep looking for the right therapists. Be open minded and honest with them. Youre not alone in feeling like youre manipulating your therapist. I tell mine I feel like Im doing that all the time and she explains how she knows Im not. Whether I believe her is different but I think there is something worth fixing if Im worried about manipulating someone who is trained in cognitive behaviors. Likewise if you truly are seeking attention Im not saying you are and I dont believe you are that alone is something worth going to therapy for.Anyway back to my original point.

Its a little telling that she was shocked.. sounds like in that instance it was a little more about her than you. Another thing that keeps coming up in my studies is the value of the beginners mind... new therapists can form powerful connections with clients that lead to better outcomes because they dont have as much experience steering their own expectations. Just like car accidents increase I think it was for middle aged people? Because they feel so confident in their abilities. You got some great input. And it didnt sound to me like you only want to talk and are opposed to putting in the work. I would also be disappointed with that structured of a session with homework every week. Hopefully you and your therapist can collaborate more as the other person mentioned and she can accommodate your needs better until you two can meet halfway. Or find someone who feels like a better fit after you guys discuss these things. My therapist provides me with informational sheets that I can peruse on my own time and we just keep building on ways that I am coping with anxiety in real life adding successes that help me have a better outlook in myself and abilities. So its not just talking. I can tell that she encourages me to expand my boundaries without telling me what to do. Im appreciating her style more and more and I hope you eventually find therapy equally beneficial. I have had anxiety before sessions too and come away a few times feeling very selfconscious but its also a good exercise to let those feelings roll off and take whats beneficial away from the experience ,mentalhealth,cphfp1k,2,t5_2qirg

Lets just say its hard for me to feel happy or enjoy anything I need constant entertainment and attention but it never stops me for trying yo have SOMETHING with SOMEONE. For better or worse you may just feel that you are inadequate due to your lack of a social life. But dont panic people go for years never meeting or having relationships with ANYONE. You have something special with some one who loves you and will only do so more if you just be yourself. Finding that inner you can be hard but the journey is worth it. And as far as having no social life BUT also having a happy marriage I think you may actually do better without the extra stress because it allows you to FOCUS on what is important to you and even more importantly to EACH OTHER. So go out there and live man you can only make things FEEL better if you DO better. Make the most out of the least. Cause sometimes that least thing can turn out to be the best and most important thing when there is nothing else. And if you are feeling lonely talk to her she loves you and will understand hope this helps.,mentalhealth,cqi25uv,1,t5_2qirg
3800678,0,t1_cqiod0j,Im impressed with a CES Ultra ad on You Tube that puts so much emphasis on insomnia.  The research would justify a little more enthusiasm on the sellers part for this as a depression and anxiety treatment and this seller is going out of his way to avoid exaggerated claims which says honesty to me.  Of course for anybody with depression and insomnia a good insomnia treatment is a good depression treatment.  Other Ultra ads use stressfree in the companys slogan  acceptable I suppose by advertising hype standards e.g. the best pizza youre ever tasted.  Its good to see the price of CES coming down but I hope the Alpha Stim makers will be in business for a long time because they seem to be the only CES makers with a chronic pain treatment and it also seems that theyve done an excellent job with their device.  Of course somebody else might come up with a pain device  maybe Ultra.BTW research at the Univ of Kansas found  hrs. of sleep to be one of six key lifestyle factors in treating depression source The Depression Cure by Ilardi.

4227862,0,t3_39bik9,First and foremost are you getting professional help for your PTSD? That would be my first recommendation. Also. Have you received any treatment for anxietydepression? Rumination going over and over those negative thoughts is a very common feature of both.Its extremely difficult to actually shut off or get rid of thoughts like these especially if theyve been going on for a long time. As youve already found simply trying to think the opposite doesnt really work either. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy CBT can be helpful in teaching you to challenge those thoughts and think more rationallyrealistically. You can start dismantling the thought process. You can learn to look for the evidence that for example youre worthless or stupid. You may not instantly believe youre wonderfulamazingmost talented person ever but perhaps youll realise that youre ok and as worthyacceptable as anyone else. You can do this through self help books or online resources.Perhaps even more helpful would be something like Acceptance and Comittment Therapy ACT which is more about recognising your thoughts without judgement learning to accept them and tolerate them. You still have the thoughts they come and go but theyre not as painful or damaging. The Happiness Trap is a selfhelp type book on ACT. Or more generally look into mindfulness for the same kind of thing.,mentalhealth,cs25itr,2,t5_2qirg

4349462,0,t1_csf6jme,Thanks for your reply. I cant really pin point for you what events in my past caused these symptoms to occur but I have a few events growing up that I believe might have triggered these inner emotions. Growing up in an Asian family I was beaten a lot for doing anything slightly out of my parents standards. I think it has led me throughout my life to be quiet and not speak up when there was anything wrong since talking or doing what I wanted would lead to an argument which I  have learnt from the encounters with my parents. Now as a non assertive and quiet person at school you know how these people usually end up. They usually get picked on and made fun of. I was never really bullied at school as I was friendly and slightly talkative and fun to hang around with. But I was still occasionally made fun of in my group of friends. Not alot but a tiny bit. I guess its normal in a group of friends to have fun. A few years later in University I had a few roommate issues particularly in my second year where the roommate I lived beside always slided his feet across the wall we shared. I think my fear of noises grew exponentially here and my paranoia also took a steep growth. I would sleep with my fan on during the winter to have the white noise running in the background so I could sleep better. Also I think it greatly forced me to keep my emotions still which I look back to this day as the worst decision I made. Instead of letting my anger out I would keep it in. Now writing this and looking back I feel I have grown totally emotionless because of this event. I remember in high school how playful and fun I was. I think these events have created the person I am today. As well a few issues at home has caused even greater depression. If you have read my other posts my mom is showing signs of a mental illness and my parents are in a difficult financial situation. The fun in me has totally extinguished. The only emotions I show now are either anger or sadness. However when I chill with my friends I do get a slight sense of happiness and relief but these are usually temporary. I usually live my day emotionless and the occasional anger or sadness.And you are right about not loving myself. I dont really like the way I look now. Probably influenced by the Korean culture and the guys portrayed in society.  And about having compassion for my suffering. The thing is I dont want to be a burden to people with my problems. I dont want people to feel sorry for me but help me get past it. I need to be strong like you said earlier. And about therapy do I need to go see my family doctor for suggestions or can I go to a clinic straight away? I think seeing one will definitely help,mentalhealth,csfx066,2,t5_2qirg
4354297,0,t3_3aqhew,So many other illnesses have earned respect in our society. When someone has been diagnosed with cancer or has survived a heart attack there are fundraisers meals brought to the house and cards arriving in the mail. If someone were to make an attempt on their own life however it is spoken of in whispers and is swept under the rug. Mental illness can be just as deadly as any other illness.This brought tears to my eyes.  It is so true and so unfortunate.  I constantly hear comments about how because the suicide survivor didnt actually die that she was just attention seeking.  I always correct them and let them know that she had the intention of ending her life every single attempt.  No one was better or worse than another.  ,mentalhealth,csggn5o,2,t5_2qirg
4356002,0,t3_3avtu4,Heres my take on thisOne he shouldnt be trying to fix you This is his first kind of shitty move. Shitty towards you. You have almost zero blame in this? That isnt his job and he has no idea what will make you hurt and what will make you feel better. He cant just test things he did with another different! mentally ill person on you. You arent the same as that person and you have different illnesses. It wont work the same way.Two you dont need to be fixed. You arent broken you just have an illness. Thats like if he tried to fix someones cancer by just ignoring it. You have an illness. It needs to be TREATED not fixed.Three he sounds like hes getting fed up with your mental health issues which is a shitty thing to say straight up. He shouldnt make you feel like you need to cut back on your mental illness. How do you cut back on an illness? How would that even work? It just makes it worse and creates more problems for him and you in the long run. In the end Id say drop him like a hot rock to be completely honest. You dont need people to police the way you feel just so they can tolerate being around you. And I agree its SUPER HARD to make friends normally but its harder when you have a mental illness. I have no tips for making friends except maybe find a support group and people who have similar issues that wont berate you for being the way you are. People who are similar to you are sometimes the best friends to make when it comes to mental health problems.,mentalhealth,csgnki1,1,t5_2qirg

If you have a few months of meds you may go straight for this.You may need to make minor changes to your meds but I have never had to doing this.Finally if you have a serious mental health issue and none of the above is possible I strongly recommend that you start finding a way to move somewhere  where there is adequate support for you no matter what.,mentalhealth,cspe0tv,7,t5_2qirg
4482752,0,t3_3chpkg,I have to disagree with the negative comments regarding crisis care.  Yes there are places that are not condusive to rehabilitation and where people are not treated with dignity or respect.  However this does not apply to every health facility and actually these places can provide a lot of support and a safe environment for the person to stabalize in.  A lot of places have come a long way from the one flew over the cuckoos nest days.  I have used these facilities before and they hav helped immensly not only for me but also my loved ones who can get some space to reevaluate things and get advice.I dont know why your sister has done this people have many reasons but I have been in her place before and it sucks. you say that prevention is on her but in my experience when you feel that bad making logical decisions regardless of how they may impact other people is not top of the list.I hope you all find ways to cope.  Has she attended any kind of therapy outside of the crisis facility?  Maybe one or two family sessions could help?

4525740,0,t1_ct0zy7x,Im very similar with emotions a few years ago when i went to therapy for what i thought was depression my doctor thought i was bipolar so i got put on medication for that and it completely destroyed a lot of my selfesteem. I have difficulty not only feeling but when i do feel emotions showing them. My best example is christmas. When i was a child i would get presents from relatives that were really awesome and id love them but i wouldnt jump up and down and im talking like really young here  range and go crazy for them and id basically give a forced thank you because my brain would tell me that was the right thing to do. Or in my last relationship on a more recent note i had to look my ex in the eye and tell her i was not sure if i loved her because i really dont know what that feels like. I also suffer insomnia but no paranoia really and definitely no hypochondria. Im extremely sensitive towards criticism often jumping to the conclusion that everything is my fault and im a total failure then immediately jumping to wait a second screw these guys theres no way im wrong. a lot of people would think that being a narcissist id be promiscuous and in a way i am in terms of getting around not a lot but a significant amount more than is healthy Im still clean though!!! but at the same time i dont really care for sex and dont have much of a drive unless its in the moment. Its usually the furthest thing from my mind and even sometimes when it may be the right time i either lose interest or never had it in the first place and just dont sugar the cookie if you will.

Im not sure whether exposure therapy would work for you but it seems like its worth a shot.  If it starts to make you miserable you can always cut it off.Yeah I think an SSRI might make you care less and free you up to think about other things.  Medication can be nice in that it makes things easier without any effort on your part.  But different people respond to SSRIs differently and the same person is likely to respond to different SSRIs differently.  If medication is something you want to try you should talk to a psychiatrist maybe a couple of psychiatrists to get different opinions.  Make sure you followup with the psychiatrist as the drug begins to take effect so that you can be monitored for negative side effects.  Ideally youd want to supplement the drug with some kind of cognitivebehavioral work because the effectiveness of a given medication can decrease over time  you want to make sure youre wellequipped should you want or need to come off the medication in the future.,mentalhealth,ctnb4x1,1,t5_2qirg

Ive never had any problems with this and I think its the best solution for this problem.There are a few issues with allowing these submissions to stay up . despite how vigilant the mods are there will always responses that offer diagnoses and . the wellmeaning people who do explain that diagnosis is not possible often dont leave as comprehensive of an explanation as the one that a mod could send.

4898790,0,t3_3hziih,Its a pretty terrible bill for the exact reasons you mentioned in the OP. Contrary to what a lot of people believe about HIPAA the privacy protections already have a loophole that allows disclosure of protected health information to family in the event that the doctor believes there is imminent risk of harm to or by the patient. All this section of the bill is doing is needlessly  and dangerously  infringing upon the civil liberties of people with mental illness. Initially drafted as a direct response by the way to the Sandy Hook shootings which I feel is pretty disingenuous given  as Im sure you know  that people with mental illness are no likelier to commit violent crimes and are in fact more likely to be victims of violent crimes than people without mental illness. Not to mention that Lanza the Sandy Hook shooter did not even have a diagnosed mental illness but was on the autism spectrum...also NOT linked to violence. Essentially this was one big a terrible thing happened! Quick find a scapegoat! which is just...human nature I suppose.As you said the bill also makes it easier to impose forced treatment on people. There are other major significant things that are troubling about the bill including the fact that it is attempting to remove the ability of the Protection and Advocacy groups from doing civil rights work on behalf of individuals with mental illness  work that has been vital in areas like housing and employment discrimination  and limit them to only bringing abuse and neglect claims against institutions. Really disturbing stuff.I have a lot of thoughts on this clearly but Im typing this on my phone and its getting a little unwieldy. TLDR this bill has major problems and shows a scary disrespect for the rights of people with mental illness and I believe NAMI is misguided in supporting it.,mentalhealth,cuc14vt,4,t5_2qirg

4920490,0,t1_cuep1hf,sounds like some normal stresses dealing with work politics an unfamiliar environment plus losing control doing things on someone elses time. The control thing used to affect me.Do you have a routine in the morning? Id suggest giving yourself a bit more time to get ready before work thats your time. It will help you feel like youre in control of your day and not rushed. Even something as little as being able to sit and enjoy your breakfast and read your favourite blog in the morning is calming and will get you in the right headspace for the day. Try without the meds if you can dont think of it as not normal. Its just something new for you you dont need to click into work straight away I think it took me a good year out of Uni to feel like I got work its a very different environment. No one teaches you things like time management on the job do you email someone or go over to their desk can you go out for lunch early plus adding in that these are all new faces. So seriously dont be too hard on yourself. PM me if youd like to talk more  Good luck!,mentalhealth,cuerllc,1,t5_2qirg

Its so painful losing a close friend but its especially frustrating when its caused by mental illnessparticularly an illness you dont even know you have and so cannot explain it!Ive also lost friends in the past before I was diagnosed with bipolar and GAD. I was told I had major depression and PTSD at the time but I didnt tell many people that so all my friends and family saw was an outofcontrol ragenado. I cant fault those who left me. Now that I know whats up and am in a better place I can TELL my close friends about it watch for triggers and get help when I slip into a bad episode. Its still not easy at all...but knowing whats wrong helps. I hope having a diagnosis helps you too.Personally I have not reached out to the people I lost and probably never will but have you considered showing your old friend this letter? Im not suggesting you do only you can decide if thatd be a good idea but I wonder if it would not provide some closure for both you and her.

The issues you mention above can be worked on so he feels better and lives better. I imagine he doesnt see how thats possible right now. Trust issues can be dealt with if he works with a compatible therapist. He may benefit from some shortterm medication. The therapist can recommend a doctor if needed. Keep checking on him. I hope hes okay. You have done what you can do for now.

Exactly how far does this go? Is she showering? Its OK to want to wear comfy clothes and honestly teenagers especially selfconscious rebellious ones love it when you hate the way they dress been there done that. Its possible shes anxious about going off to college or just trying to enjoy the break she has from school right now and her alone time. When I was her age I was dealing with depression and  rebellion and lots of other stuff and looking back now several hypomanic episodes in between. I went through periods if no friends and the life of the party. More often no friends but I liked it that way. I had one or two people I could talk to and then not talk to for months then we would pick up again as if it were yesterday. So maybe just let her know youre here if she ever wants to talk. Dont force yourself into her life because that honestly is what it sounds like you and your family are trying to do and I know I would have hated you all for that if it were me. Just maybe tomorrow morning when she says good morning back say oh hey by the way I just wanted to let you that Im here for you if you ever want to talk or need help with anything. she might roll her eyes or say whatever but shell remember and she might take you up on it.,mentalhealth,cvhbm23,3,t5_2qirg
5305363,0,t1_cvphjc8,gt That you rely on subjective judgment does not make something not an illness. Youre the one saying something exists you have the burden or proof to prove it not the skeptic.This is the exact same debate we atheists have with religious fundies.gt Even today thats how most things are diagnosedWrong.  For physically measurable damageloss of function sometimes a person guesses before a physical diagnosis is made to verify such.  Thats not the same as psychiatry where there is no physical diagnosis amp its  subjective moral opinion.gt That makes them no less real no less than any other disease that we were not able to diagnose until recently.Youre confused.  I hear this a lot that some future science will prove psychiatric claims.Really future technology cant prove mental illness theories because theyre based on moral subjective opinions Declaring that behaviors or feelings are illnesses is making a moral judgement that they are bad.  eg no one would try to claim hard work or heterosexual porn was a mental illness because they view them morally as good.And that making moral judgements about various behaviorsfeelings is out of the realm of science.Example the mental illness called transvestic fetishism.  This is the idea that its fine to masturbate to straight porn or all sorts of other types but that masturbating to transsexual porn is a mental illness.Such a moral opinion can not be proven by future science.  ,mentalhealth,cvptlam,-2,t5_2qirg

There are also links to online pharmacys on Reddit. First you do need to see a psychologist to pinpoint your issue and determine which antidepressant is right for you. And you need a prescription. Many countys thought the US have county Mental Health Offices. The will charge you only what you can afford. They will also prescribe you a generic antidepressant to save you money. They may even have free samples to try. To answer you question I have been using antidepressant under a doctors care for  years. I currently have insurance and I pay a  copay to see the Doc. every three to six months. I always get generic prescriptions so my out of pocket cost is not that much. If for some reason your county does not have a mental health office like mine we have a subsidized Mental Health Office called Port Human Services.

Dental and vision are kind of the same but seem to result in me paying more out of pocket. Tests and the such also have copays. If I need an MRI I will pay  out of pocket. Other procedurestests could be higher or lower than that  depends on the test they are doing. It can be tough to navigate the system. We dont have one medical system administered by the Government. Most of our medicaldentalvision are for profit. Our doctors dont give medications they write proscriptions and we take them to a pharmacy to have them filled.

6166487,0,t3_400udc,gt I dont know what the fuck is wrong with me.Nothing is wrong with you. You are having an understandable reaction to a traumatic event that happened to you. You deserve to give yourself more compassion. It doesnt matter that it was  years ago it affected you deeply and this time of year brings up the bad feelings all over again.First of all and this is hard I know but please dont deprive yourself of sleep. You will only feel worse in the long run. Regular sleep is so important when mental health is involved or any health really. Try to wind down at night. Take a bath sip tea read a book... dont try to force sleep but do things that naturally encourage sleepiness. If its impossible consider seeing your doctor for a temporary course of sleeping pills. Often you wont dream on them part of why theyre not a great longterm solution which might help you in the immediate.Youre reluctant to go to therapy and discuss this which is understandable given how it makes you feel but working through it might be what you need. A psychiatrist can give you pills to help with the anxiety and depression to an extent but trauma is complex and cant be medicated away.However if it is simply too much to consider at this point maybe you should treat the worst of the symptoms insomnia depression anxiety etc to get them under control and then consider a therapist.Do you think that might be possible for you?

Your local clinic should have payment based on low income mine is  minimum that can at least refer you to their psychiatrist for temporary help and will be able to assist you in finding a more permanent solution if need be.Before you do that request your file to be released from the rehab center so that you can provide that to whoever you see.

You may not feel a connection upon meeting the first person you set up an appointment with but thats ok keep looking until you find someone you like. Your first session will be pretty simple mostly general questions about paperwork you fill out what brought you to therapy and goals.

7735614,0,t3_4l97rn,Ill say this right up front dont blame yourself for your feelings or thoughts that pop into your head that you may see as insensitive or unfair to these people because they have these issues if theres one thing Ive learned we cant really control that kind of shit. You see one of the things Ive learned in my life is even if someones actions arent necessarily by choice or that they have trouble controlling those actions it doesnt mean that what they do or say cant be annoying or even downright mean  it can its just that they may not understand that fact or they simply dont even notice.Now I know you may have heard that a million times but we forget sometimes and you just need to try and remember that stuff but I will say that besides saying that they are a bad person for the things they do the worst thing you can do is just go along with it and let them have the excuse of they cant change it so let them do it.One of the best approaches to these situations is to channel those emotions realize that yes they may not have full control but there are ways that they can gain some control over their behavior but they cant do it alone they need professional help first and foremost but they also need someone to talk to them learn what coping skills a professional has taught them and do little things like reminding them of their problematic behavior when it happens and telling them to use the coping skills they have learned from the experts.It may be hard to deal with trust me Ive seen it plenty of times and Ive helped a lot of people with mental illness and the like but if you do try and make a connection if you open up a bit yourself and share some of the things that have helped you they will be more inclined to follow suit and when you do learn what helps them you can help them use those skills when they might not be in the right state of mind to do it themselves.A lot of helping a person deal with the day to day is about calling them out on these things not in a mean way but in a kind and supportive way dont try to punish them when they fall tell them that they cant be perfect and that doing nothing is the only true failure.Another thing Ive found works quite well is finding out what the signs are and teaching those signs to the person asking them what it feels like when they do these things what changes happen and drilling them with a simple message look for those indicators of problematic action try to deal with them yourself and if you cant find a friend who knows how to help you and have them do just that.I know I went a bit off topic but it does relate a lot to dealing with your own emotions about how they act if you become close to them theyll do the same for you and while they might have trouble seeing the issues in themselves they can see the ones in you easier and if you need to take a break theyll be understanding about it if they realize that their actions negatively impact you in many cases they will start to be more likely to use their coping skills and not act as erratically because the empathy they feel makes them not want you to feel bad.All in all it seems to be hard to deal with and it can very much be so in the beginning but if you stay firm and try to help teach them and just be a friend theyll most likely lessen these actions and will be more understanding of your needs as well as their own and things get better.I know it can be hard but stick with them and you can help them out in ways you never imagined and youd be surprised at how much they can help you.,mentalhealth,d3lhfot,2,t5_2qirg

7967979,0,t1_d4bdzu0,It really isnt similar at all.BDD is an anxiety disorder on the obsessive compulsive spectrum. It is characterized by an intense fixation on a tiny or imaginary physical flaw which the sufferer perceives as a grotesque deformity. Changing their appearance does nothing to alleviate distress because their distress is rooted in an inability to objectively recognize what they really look like. They will continue to see themselves as grotesquely deformed regardless of their actual appearance.BDD while totally unresponsive to physical changes responds very well to therapy and medication that help the patient gain a more accurate ability to recognize their own appearance.This has absolutely nothing in common with gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is not an anxiety disorder and it is not on the obsessive compulsive spectrum at all. People with gender dysphoria have a perfectly objective accurate recognition of their own appearance  they just seek to change that appearance to better align with their gender identity.Gender dysphoria shows no effective response to therapy or medication. Physical treatment however is incredibly effective at alleviating it. Fix the physical conditions causing distress and the distress goes away.By way of comparison this is like the difference between someone with anorexia vs. someone with clinically significant levels of distress due to being obese. In the former case no amount of weight loss will ever be enough. There is no end goal no point at which the sufferer will decide that they have reached their goal and are satisfied with their appearance. They will continue to think they are fat even as they starve to death.In the latter case the patient may have a perfectly objective recognition of their physical condition and a realistic plan for changing it. There is an end goal and when they have reached their target weight and fitness levels they will stop because those goals have been accomplished. They might benefit from therapy to help them cope with the stress of their circumstances along the way but the root of their problem is physical and it has a physical solution.,mentalhealth,d4bod0d,2,t5_2qirg

Sure being honest in a relationship is something everybody should strive for  but in everydays life your colleagues probably dont need to know. Sometime it can be detrimental to do so although quite frankly the stygma surrounding mental illnesses is way smaller than ten years ago.I have GAD and Social Phobia. While today they are both well under control theyre still challenging but no longer mindnumbingly overwhelming Ive learned that since the range of reactions I can get is so mixed perhaps I would be better to be selective as to who I am putting in the known. My close friends know it. My HR at my old job knew it too.

8934166,0,t3_52njxh,Your brother suffered an episode of psychosis. Psychosis is a symptoms of a disorder rather than the disorder itself  it manifests as delusions confusion hallucinations and paranoia onset is often sudden. Forms of psychosis are associated with bipolar disorder depression some personality disorders schizophrenia and other mental illnesses but can also be brought on by physical illness like high fevers and substance use  changes to substance use. It is very important that he seek medial attention to diagnose the cause of the episode and help prevent future episodes and to help him and his family stay safe. Also  early treatment is most effective.  treatment at the first signs of psychosis is best for long term outcome. I really can not stress enough how important it is to get him to a hospital.Edit i wrote up some guidelines on how to talk to him during an episode and how you can help get him help. When someone is having an episode it is important to remember that what you are doing is offering first aid  like you would for someone who had just been in a car accident. Stay calm speak clearly and succinctly focus on deescalating  and make sure you pit your own safety first. Source a very good friend of mine has bipolar disorder and i was with her during her first episode and have done a lot of reading as a response... Please talk to a professional! I am not one.  recognize that the delusions andor hallucinations are very real to him during an episode so do not dismiss minimize or argue with him about his delusions. Do not act alarmed horrified or embarrassed by what he tells you treat what he says seriously with out encouraging or inflaming his paranoia comply with requests that are not endangering or unreasonable to offer a sense control  if he wants you to sit in a ball on the floor do so.  take any threats or warnings seriously particularly if he believes he is being persecuted contact emergency services as soon as you feel the need if you fear he may harm himself or others  there is never just one. If cause is untreated this will happen again  it may happen again even if the cause is treated. You need to understand that unless a person with psychosis meets the criteria for involuntary committal procedures they cannot be forced into treatment. This criteria mostly depends on where you live. If he doesnt agree to treatment during this after the episode be patient people experiencing psychosis often need time to develop insight regarding their illness. You said family was keeping him calm they should provide a compelling reason for him to seek a professional.,mentalhealth,d7lr6e3,16,t5_2qirg

I felt like it helped me subconsciously a bit in being able to not fall quite as deep into the nightmare if that makes since. Many of mine were recounting so when I figured out their pattern I was able to tell myself to not fall into the trap.,mentalhealth,d8qsg8b,2,t5_2qirg
9271725,0,t1_d8p4yo2,Thank you for your comment. While it may be helpful to talk to others with autism I just dont think the major behaviour problems are because of autism. I really think it is a personality or mood disorder that is more of the cause. Perhaps when that is taken care of then we could focus on making sure we understand her autism too which we have done all her life she got help for autism when she was a child but unfortunately most autism treatment is offered to children not adults especially my sister who is really high functioning. I know you cant just split up a person into autism and a mood disorder separately but it just doesnt feel like the root of the problem.

The night was back in June and it seems that I didnt actually say the things that I think I did but Im still not sure.  As a result I feel really guilty for the bad things that I said and did.  At the end of August I really wasnt feeling well mentally and physically and I went to the psychiatric ward for a few days.  I was given some medication and started to feel more like myself. At the end of September I started to feel really bad again about things I might have done so I returned to stay with my parents for a bit.  I started to see a psychiatrist on a weekly basis he diagnosed me with pathological guilt and gave me an additional medication to take.  I was told it would take a few weeks to work which was true.  Ive started to feel better but still think about the whole situation. Ive felt like Ive been a burden on people but I realize that they love me and that they want me to get better.  ,mentalhealth,da2xi4p,1,t5_2qirg

You can take their ability to do it in public you can take their ability to do it to certain people but you cant stop them. Theyll just target other people  areas of life. Its in their roots theyre just miserable and pathetic. All you can do is either solve the roots or kill them and at that point its far easier to help them as that spreads on its own. Its not even about helping everyone but helping enough to kick of a chain reaction. Its a steady and slow process but well get there.Im just saying if you REALLY want to change the world you have to work with them instead of against them despite how you feel.One last advice Find out why they behave the way they do.

10026356,0,t1_dbefq98,Trust me girl that is EXACTLY how I felt about them too. Didnt want to take them because I never wanted to be dependent on medications you know? I just suggest before youhim start taking any that you make sure the psychiatrist lets you know any of the long term side effects. And maybe even look them up yourself. There are lots of different medications and lots of different doses so dont be afraid if youhim start a medication and there are lots of side effects. Everyone is different and they react differently to everything. For example by BF started on mg of Vyvanse for his ADHD. Had good symptoms for the first week then no libido no appetite irritable insomnia excessive sweating. We went to the doc and got him on a lower dose of mg and everything is perfect now no bad side effects and he still gets the positive effects of it. If it changes we can always go back and try a different kindMaybe kind of use the medications as something to help get started on making a more positive lifestyle for himself. He can use them to start feeling better and then he can start doing better for himself while also weaning off the medications then he might be in a better place.My anxiety I have been able to manage through talk therapy yoga and meditation. But my BFs condition is much different than mine so I understand he NEEDS his to feel.. well functional. That might be the case for your BF. But I would support him and dont let him be skeptical of the medications  they could change his life for the better.Best of luck to you OP!,mentalhealth,dbegmv1,1,t5_2qirg

I want to do proactive things to get rid of it because that is the normal thing for an illness. I didnt get depression from stress or anything external and its just random for me. With ACT I lose hope and then get really agitated is what is happening right now. Like for example in social situations I have problems but I force myself into them anyways and they still dont match up to how they were prior to being depressed. I have social anxiety that was never there before I got depression and the thing is forced social interaction also doesnt get rid of it because I am having trouble AND I verified that close friends do notice that socially Im not the same which again is a nd verification that this needs to be fixed asap. I just dont have the patience for therapy and it hurts to do it when I am in one word just desperate. ,mentalhealth,dbmhfu8,1,t5_2qirg

Dont get discoraged and dont base your life and expectations on the challenges of your parents you have to build your own path in life.I have a suggestion for you start searching for organizations in your area where you can volunteer your time that is a great way to get to know people help worthy causes and also improve your self esteem...and why not? It can help you get a paying job. You may also look into tutoring needy students at community centers or by joining a nonprofit organization that helps poor students get into STEM careers. There are also nonprofit organizations that send volunteers abroad to undeveloped countries to help improve environmental or energy installations your degree can be very helpful there look for those organizations on the internet. That woul be a great experience and build your resume.Also find about meetings of professional organizations in your field and volunteering opportunities there as well as preparation classes for your professional exam better take refresher classes that can help you bring structure to your studying instead of studying alone. Another excellent source of networking for STEM graduates are MEETUP meetings look for it on the internet where you can find people of all expertise levels that join together in groups and share knowledge and projects on robotics arduino builds artificial intelligence environment solar energy etc. these and the MAKERS meetings I think are very recommended for recent graduates they meet periodically and you can learn a lot from the experts there and also why not? get a few mentors and friends.Good luck my friend!,mentalhealth,dcr1dxx,1,t5_2qirg

10603258,0,t3_5roy38,Pretty simple. Trick your brain into associating the image with a good memory or something of your choosing. Look at the image and focus on whatever you want the image to make you think of. Allow the emotion associated with whatever you want the image to make you think of filly our body. Do this at least once a day for a minute or two. It shouldnt take long to see that you will start associating the image with your new thoughts and feelings about it.,mentalhealth,dd9n8l9,1,t5_2qirg

Thats hard to do especially if lots of different people who may be each others trigger in one way or another are in the same space. Possibly more difficult than day trips or craft sessions or quiet rooms.     Definitely second hiring a great staff and making sure their mental health is taken care of.    I personally like the idea of giving people responsibilities here and there to get them on their feet. Help someone teach a skill in a class. Let someone help with dinner. Have volunteer mentorship or hire a person as staff if theyve shown theyre ready at that point in their life though this could considerably complicate things.It sounds like you have a great idea and I really hope it goes well. ,mentalhealth,dde7ab0,2,t5_2qirg

SA can cause  or worsen  this in people with specific genetics and behavioral conditioning see below. Alcoholics Anonymous  Marijuana Anonymous  andor Narcotics Anonymous  can be helpful. Or using the SAMHSA facility locator  online to find a detox amp rehab.  If one is NOT doing the above they may need lab work to determine if they have hormonal e.g. thyroid or metabolic e.g. low Vitamin D imbalances. See a competent MD DO PA or NP. To find one in your area use the clinician locators mentioned below or get a referral from your GPPC doc. Medications but only if really needed to get one stabilized enough to do next seven things on this list Find a board certified psychopharmacologist in your area by using the physician locators below.

DBT MBCT ACT MBBT and MBSR are terrific for emotional symptom management.

If you dig a little on each page you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview them as though they were applying for a job with your company. Most psychiatrists btw are not therapists themselves they are medication specialists but can refer you to those who are and are often excellent sources of referral. Mindfulness Meditation Try the Vipassana or Theravada Meditation styles? For a lot of people with anxiety unwanted mania and depression this stuff handles them all chop chop. Many of the modern mindfulnessbased psychotherapies are actually based on these now. Therapy Workbooks I got a lot of liftoff by using inexpensive workbooks built on CBT ACT DBT MBBT and MBCT workbooks like these and these and these and these  Moderate Exercise Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... and it can help to massage the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy. Diet A lot of people with depression mania andor anxiety eat very poorly. Junk food  not to mention too little nutritious food  will definitely impact those who are overly stressed and make symptoms worse. Highquality frozen meals are better than McFood of almost any kind but HQ fresh especially Mediterranean  though not pizza  and Asian food appears to be best for pts with CPTSD symptoms. Healthy fats in moderation btw are known to be good for depression. Add a  IU soft gel of Vitamin D too.Of the ten  and  are the only ones that cost much and several are totally free. ,mentalhealth,ddx89re,0,t5_2qirg

Substance dependence is a thing too but you certainly dont sound as though you are physically or psychologically dependent on any substance. Nevertheless everyones physiology is different and even small amounts of cannabis for you may cause some detriment. Just monitor it for yourself. You could always keep a diary of anything you put into your body whether its water antibiotics spinach coffee tomato wheat or cannabis and see how these things affect your physical and mental health. Caffeine is something that is easy to become dependent on physically and psychologically they can cause or exacerbate physical and mental health issues. A lot of people dont like to hear that because they are hard core caffeine addicts and cant imagine a life without it but it does much more harm than good.
