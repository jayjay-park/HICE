152185,0,t1_cevrfoo,Yeah he did again Chris Messina is great and he has great chemistry with Mindy but the way it was written was not at all satisfying. I loved the way you saw his brain working when the plane encountered turbulence but after that it got too clich and fell flat for me. You know hes going to grab her and kiss her. And Mindy just submits to this kiss despite being all CliffCliffCliff. I just didnt buy it but thats just me!,themindyproject,cevrk8i,1,t5_2ull8

2399660,0,t1_cm6qgj8,All the characters on the show are good  especially the women.  Beverly is definitely my favorite.  Always has been.  Shes so weird and out there.  Love it.  Tamara is amazing obviously.  Love Ma and Dot.  Oh Dot.  She is such a good addition to the show.  And the new lesbian chief  it was during this most recent episode that I realized how good she is.  I told my husband who watches with me Wow her character is really good and the actress nails that part.  Shes funny but not overthetop like most of the other characters.  Yes overthetop borderline unrealistic characters are awesome and funny but youve got to have the somewhat normal grounded characters too so that the show doesnt become too wacky.  And I couldnt gush over the women without mentioning Mindy.  Uh shes amazing!!,themindyproject,cm8b0z9,5,t5_2ull8
2479598,0,t1_cmi0wy2,I wanted to make out with him every episode he was in. That said I didnt like how they wrapped up his character arc as being flighty and trying to cheat with Mindy. I didnt think that was true to character at all and it was probably the one thing that has disappointed me about the show. ,themindyproject,cmi7za0,6,t5_2ull8
2490913,0,t3_2nx68n,Ive been thinking about this a lot as well. I agree with you I think its way to early for them to get married. It doesnt feel right at the moment. The best thing about this show is that the pacing their relationship in particular is fantastic. Every step of their relationship has felt right and natural for both characters except for that time Danny dated Peters sister. So I just going to trust the writers and wait a bit. If I could take a guess for this midseason finale either a real real talk about where they see this relationship heading andor moving in. And by real real they should talk about if marriage is even a thing Danny would want to try again. If so when. Can Mindy wait would she want to if that means shed have to wait years. Do they want children. Would Mindy move into Dannys place vice versa or would they find a place together. They would necessarily have to talk about all these things but theyve been flying this thing by the seat of their pants. Its important for them to see each others goals and expectations. Which I think was one of the reason for the diary. That like each other but are they willing to compromise? What would that involve? Furthermore weve seen Mindy with Dannys mom. But what if her brother or other family. Dont like Danny. Is that a thing that matters to Mindy? They got a lot of wiggle room in this relationship they havent even been together a year. ,themindyproject,cmjp8d0,5,t5_2ull8

5122899,0,t3_3l1464,Danny still loving Mindy in the dream was perfect.  When she asked Why didnt you kiss me?  I was half expecting him to say because you were fucking that dude! Not really... but something along those lines.  It was perfect.  He was hurt.    I also really loved Danny looking at the binder of potential husbands and asking if it was full of white NBA players.  I know a lot of people have a problem with her Mindy Kaling not casting people of color as her love interests but that line was golden.  ,themindyproject,cv3i227,15,t5_2ull8
5909829,0,t1_cxt8j03,No not at all... it made me so thankful for how awesome my husband is and also thankful for the way my parents raised me because Id never have lasted  minutes in a relationship with someone as controlling and manipulative and negative as Danny before kicking him to the curb.Mindy and Dannys relationship is domestic abuse with reproductive coercion as well. If it at all reminds you of your relationship please read over this list of domestic abuse signs and reevaluate that relationship. ,themindyproject,cxub7zv,4,t5_2ull8
5992240,0,t1_cy4z4z2,Love happy endings! Bonus points for Adam Pally! Its a great show and I enjoy both because of the JPM! Brooklyn Nine Nine isnt as smart in that you dont have to think about some of the jokes but its really a fun show. For a change in pace Bobs Burgers and Archer. ,themindyproject,cy543f2,5,t5_2ull8
7313192,0,t1_d296znm,Agreed. The showrunner said in an interview the season is still overall focused on Mindy and Dannys relationship so I hold out some hope... less after he wasnt on tonight ,themindyproject,d29gkpf,4,t5_2ull8

8225172,0,t3_4rbxi6,Yes the closet was weird. Hello money and privacy issues here. If I reject the offer this random weirdo Jody could live above me cringe And Danny sleeping with Mindy while hiding the fact that a he has a gf and b he is engaged to be MARRIED I love the episode for what it was. Danny is a meathead who prefer to bury his head in the sand due to his own issues. Mindy trying to find faults with any man that isnt Danny so once shit hits the fan Mindy will need to step it up as both a person mother and the strong one in the relationship. Jody oh Jody why,themindyproject,d55pb8d,1,t5_2ull8
8225211,0,t3_4rmswi,Theres the classic the Office if you havent seenfinished it.  Rock is great by episode  youll understand how awesome the writers were on the show. All three movie of the Back to the Future Hairspray and other older classics have now arrived on Netflix. You can never go wrong with Samurai Champloo if you like anime the soundtrack one of the best ever produced for such a show. I rewatch Psych and RuPaul Drags race since both are my holy grail to cure boredom. List version  Rock Samurai Champloo Pysch Back to the Future movie trilogy,themindyproject,d55phjp,1,t5_2ull8
10796221,0,t3_5uar3k,Agreed and he wanted her to give up her career to be a stay at home mom. It was cleverly designed character play that helped her grow as a person in the show I think. ,themindyproject,ddtjxch,9,t5_2ull8

11619359,0,t1_da4c3ly,I could see this. But how many women date this exact type of person. But Danny did do good things for her. And he gave her Leo which means the world to her. I think we underestimate how much they did love each other. Sometimes people are willing to look past the flaws of another person because we do love them. ,themindyproject,dgd2csp,2,t5_2ull8
