2894638,0,t3_2ta0rr,I use the large sheets of gridded paper you find at Office Max or any office supply store. The grids are marked at  spacing and helps when measuring. You can get a pad of about  sheets  by  easel pad for under . I think. Its been a while they go a long way. Anyway it is so easy to use that paper and tape I like the blue painters tape easy to tear and remove and make your own patterns.  You can easily slash the paper for adjustments add more where needed.  Then flatten it out and cut your leather.   I hope this hint will help.  Good luck with your project!,costuming,cnx4h7r,2,t5_2sa5d
