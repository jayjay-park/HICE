1319123,0,t3_2964v3,I would not characterize it as a hack or an exploit. I wouldnt call it designed either. By looking at the design and conventional fingerings you can see that modern saxophones were not really designed for this range.Altissimo is a natural extension of the physics. In the same way a trumpet goes higher a saxophone can go higher. In the same way a clarinet goes higher a saxophone goes higher. The difference is that since the saxophone was not designed directly with it in mind conical shape of the horn mostly people are forced to find unstable fingerings that with correct voicing will yield the higher notes.So I understand those who call it an exploit but considering that you can play it really in the same was a trumpet using low regular fingerings I would say the fingerings are the exploit.

2410272,0,t3_2n1m82,If they are offering a significant discount on a closet horn plus extras make absolutely sure you check the usual internet stolen horn registries... Big ticket steal items tend to come up for sale either immediately or at least  years after the theft.Im going to assume that before doing any of this you really like the sound of the horn. Yamahas tend to be very consistent so Im gonna assume youve already put a tuner to it and the horn speaks well.  That being said...On the  check the intonation and clarity of tone of middle E and D. They are both going to be sharp due to equal temperament and overtone series  E especially on that horn but sometimes they can be really sharp and not speak amazingly well.  Check the double octave key mechanism and make sure the twopart one opens correctly together and cleanly.  If it is out of adjustment you want to take it to a pro.  Check the F adjustment screws and opening of the G key when the left hand pinky stack is actuated  a big cause of leaks.  If the horn is claimed to have been in the closet for a while check the condition of the felt bumpers and the metal bumpers on the low Eb C C B Bb A keys and make sure the lower bow hasnt been bashed up at all.

Go with it! If youre starting out just go nuts on the instrument make all the sounds you can dont worry about playing in key or whatever. Then when you get more confident start improvising on certain small pitch groups  over a pentatonic or even just G A D E or something.

3174173,0,t3_2wgywb,You should check and work on your mouthpiece pitch. So if you took your mouthpiece off and played on it it should land on an A if you played it to a tuner or piano. That puts your voicing in the right spot and will help with response and pitch when it comes to high and low notes. Sometimes I feel that I need to lower it some to help get low notes out but that could be caused by me raising it while playing. Now this isnt the fix to every problem it could also depend on your setup as well. Playing on too hard or soft of a reed could affect your pitch. If youre still getting used to the instrument itself it may not be the best time to work on this but it could help.,Saxophonics,cor02vd,2,t5_2rs13

5505946,0,t3_3qcwly,I just accidentally wrote a treatise on articulation over at rtuba of all places but Ill sum up the salient points here. Try tonguing the rhythm on the mouthpiece. If you find that the pitch doesnt stay dead center when tonguing on the mouthpiece then congrats you have embouchure problems. Usually playing a mouthpiece chirp thats too low resulting in constant tension. The result is to bend the pitch of the mouthpiece up and down like a siren until you can get the pitch to settle on the note that is the highest the mouthpiece can produce. It will take more firmness of embouchure to put the pitch in this place but you will be more relaxed and the pitch will be more stable. This could take weeksmonths depending on how bad it is. Keep exploring and keep at it. often going with this problem is not enough mouthpiece in your mouth or a reed thats too soft. Make sure you have fully separated the action of your tongue and the action of your breath. They are separate entities. Try the exercises listed in above questionably formatted treatise I know its a little crammed but I welcome any questionscriticism... I teach try and explore not right and wrong and will happily answer any questions. As a review for the above the foundation of good tonguing after the above islong tones breath with legato tonguestaccato notes with duration taaaaaaaaaaT and blowing through the restsbuilding to staccato repeated notes that are almost passive. your tongue bouncing off the reed almost like dribbling a basketball. passive effort.,Saxophonics,cwffp23,1,t5_2rs13

7035891,0,t3_4bzumv,Middle D? If middle d is  cents flat there is something seriously strange with your horn. Most players are very sharp on D... from the rest of your post did you mean to say sharp? For either held or very exposed middle Ds I like to also put down low B although beware that the tone changes dramatically. For normal playing however I just voice it down. I highly recommend looking into voicing exercises and be very careful to NOT as you describe drop the jaw. Try to make the same change using your throat. With practice this will be more controlled and consistent. Practice scales using your ears. Try playing any old scale over a D drone and pause when you reach D hear where you are in relation move on try again rinse repeat etc...  I know Otis Murphy teaches that D can be played perfectly in tune and also in color using the throat and tongue if one of his students reads this could they comment?Low D can be pretty flat especially when you first pick up the instrument and not everything is warmed up evenly.

Youll never completely eleminate odors but you can reduce them.For yourself make sure your teeth are burshed regularly and your mouth is rinsed before each usage of the horn. Periodically use a wet paper to gently scrub out the whole mouthpiece.If i need a cleaning solution i usually mix equal parts mint listerine and vodka into a  measuring cup and use the paper towel in the mouthpiece.For the body of the sax...Im not sure what i would use but my hunch is perhaps a small slightly damp sponge on a stick the a dry paper towel on a stick to dry it out when finished. HOWEVER i can not attest to how water reacts to the metal so take that with a grain of salt.Pads can retain smells especially if they were wet from say a flood.

9809345,0,t3_5fpzmr,Im gonna go against the grain here and say that I wouldnt recommend the C. While they used to be very solid pieces I feel that the more modern ones have taken an large hit in quality and consistency. Plus Ive never been totally impressed with anything about the mouthpiece it just felt like a big boy Yamaha c. You seem to be in high school which is a really weird place to be picking a mouthpiece. I played alto in high school an now as someone finishing up a degree in music composition Ill share some insight I gained in writing for school band. There is no such thing or at least are very few instances of truly classical music for the saxophone. Alto is an exception as its popularity in the late th centuryearly th lead to its use as many composers were trying to diverge from the norm. The saxophone especially tenor even when included in classical music is used for the comparatively brash and jazzy sound that is inherent in all saxophone tone. In band literature your main job will either be to back up the alto saxophones who are in turn backing up the horns backing up the low brass and sometimes backing up the low woodwinds. There are exceptions to this of course but these are the most common uses when it comes to ranges and function. So I wouldnt worry so much about getting a specific sound for classical and band music the tone in jazz is much more important. As long as your sound is round and dark youll sound just fine. As for my recommendation I played an Otto Link Tone Edge for a long time and found it really lush and dark but also wonderfully responsive and fun to play. If you play with your throat wide open and blowing a bunch of warm air you can even sound a bit like a cello if youre concerned about the classical sound.  It would be important to test a handful of these if youre looking to buy theyre no longer super consistent either. But Ive always been satisfied. Think Dexter Gordon thats the type of sound you can get on these pieces even though he played a dukoff stubby but darker and rounder. Most things rubber will be okay and if you can try a Theo Wanne gaia its about the same mouthpiece but loads more consistent if youre short on time to try them out. Stay away from metal for now youll stick out like a sore thumb in concert with that. tldr Otto Link Tone Edge or Theo Wanne Gaia. Dark round sound while being great for jazz. Stay away from metal as thats strictly a jazz thing youll be too bright in concert. And remember the sound comes mostly from you the mouthpiece is just a vessel so work on your own personal tone more than anything else. You can make almost any mouthpiece sound great for anything if you do that.  ,Saxophonics,dam7n2e,4,t5_2rs13

It could still be very loud to your neighbors.  You can blow into a horn with no reed focus on breathing and memorizing stuff then you can have some stuff ready for real practice.,Saxophonics,dcm6ekd,2,t5_2rs13
10408368,0,t3_5mq4qe,Nope. I just see the sheets in front of me. If I know the piece were playing well enough I end up kind of just listening while playing automatically not looking at much.,Saxophonics,dcnuu68,1,t5_2rs13

10819781,0,t3_5upqly,Ask ten guys and youll get ten answers.Is there any certain technique? No. Listen to some of your favorite guys and build on what theyre doing. You have to find your own voice. Dont scoop notes and think that it sounds jazzy. As a saxophone teacher I alway hate questions like this. There is no shortcut. The best jazz musicians I know found a way to figure it out. Im sorry to be a negative nancy but this isnt something that can be tackled by playing long tones. ,Saxophonics,ddvzfso,3,t5_2rs13

11516952,0,t3_64bjo8,Learning to play will be easy for you fingering white key notes is intuitive.  Hard part is setting embouchure not squeaking getting all notes to sound particularly if not set up perfectly and getting a good tone that you can modulate and control.  Altos are cheaper but more fussy for new players.  If you want to play tenor or Bari pick those because learning will be easier  but if you want to play all learn on alto.   Most importantly get an experienced teacher so that you dont learn wrong.  Because the reed does the work and fingering is largely intuitive youre likely to THINK youre doing it right when youre not and that will be a problem later.,Saxophonics,dg1g50g,1,t5_2rs13
