1560058,0,t1_cj8h2i6,Actually you are wrong about Mizrahim.You seem rather educated about tradition in the region. An important one is the relationship between religion and ethnicity.Even if Jews were living in Arab countries they do not consider themselves Arab. Imagine a Chinese family in Armenia that only married Chinese people. Even if their culture changed over generations to be more similar to Armenia and they speak Armenian perfectly they are still ethnically different than Armenians.Source I am Mizrahi on both sides. Mizrahi just means Eastern in Hebrew. It is actually not a very useful term. Less people use it now. And it is different than Sephardi...But you are right about cultural similarities.  Many Mizrahim had to modernize quickly when they immigrated to a society that was dominated by Ashkenazis.Most of us dont even hate Arabs. It just takes a few bad people to try to poison the water. I think the Arabs that hate Jews and the Jews that hate Arabs are the ones that dont interact with each other. ,kurdistan,cjbtrek,2,t5_2rt31

Now it is just impossible to get you in!That would make our little chance of getting into EU impossible.Things would be far easier if the northern part of your focking Kurdistan would just leave our country.I am serious on saying that it really is the best for all of us.

Our unemployed rate would go down to !GDP per capita would rise by !A huge peryeardebt burden would get the fuck off as we would no longer need to feed that region with free electricity free drinking water free healthcare free education etc!Our country ratings would rocknroll! They would hit at least AA!!And our country without that part would seem far more like OK to EU regarding if we really belong to EU or not geographically. It would be justified just so much as Georgia Azerbaijan and Armenia are also planned to be brought into the union.Take a look at the map Turkeys southern borders without that part would just fit perfectly with the starting points of Armenias southern borders..

5769845,0,t3_3u3isj,The problem is the US. The Americans have already made it clear that you can either have them or the Russians not both. YPG and KRG wont risk their relationship with America just for Russia.The advantage YPG gains is in the future negotiations. The Russians are clear that they want a united Syria with territorial integrity minus golan. However their past has shown that they dont mind selfrule and autonomous rule as long as the state is intact. YPG should present them proposals for autonomous Kurdish region that is outside the control of Damascus but still answers to them.I dont think they would like the Iraqi model. Barzani acts discredited it. One minute hes all about Kurdistan and goes out of his way to undermine the Iraqi state the next minute hes all about Iraqi and its sovereignty. Its gonna have to be a serious model that preserves Syria and gives YPG what it wants. I dont think Salih Muslim is anything like Barzani.

If a larger united country can administrate smaller countries like the UK without oppression then thats fine too.

7310301,0,t3_4fihvo,Yazdanism is just a term that Izady coined to refer to the religions practiced by Kurds with preIslamic elements Yezidism Yarsanism or Ahle Haqq and Alevism. Many elements of Yezidism are certainly derived from preIslamic Iranic beliefs sun worship bull sacrifice etc. but their interpretation often varies from Zoroastrianism which is why it probably developed parallel to it rather than being a direct descendant of said religion. The first reference of a group called the Yezidis in the Kurdish regions didnt appear until the th c. or so though.Basically Sheikh Adi a th c. mystic from Lebanon traveled to the regions of the Hakkariya Kurds near Mosul gained a following there and reformed their religion probably infusing it with Islamic elements. The socalled Adawiyya after Adi Kurds even served in the armies of the Ayyubids and the Mamluks later appointed a Yezidi as emir of the Kurds in the AzazKilis region. the Yezidis territory was far vaster in the past Theorized is that after their initial leaders perished the Yezidis moved closer to their preIslamic beliefs and practices again.

So its not just according to me and has nothing to do with my agenda or whatever its what they are actually doing.Besides do you honestly think anyone can do anything about KCK fighters who are denied a deal?

At the same time build a very powerful military so that we can repel attacks. The economy should also be more reliant on services  which would nullify a lot of the problems you have with being landlocked.So if Bashur is going to be a Nation State like France or Germany but not like Rojava which is most likely to happen then I could imagine peace and stability with a model similar to the Swiss one. We could be a massive transportation hub between all the countries surrounding us open banks for the rich people of Turkey and Iran who want to hide their money invest in lucrative business in the service sector etc.This could actually work and make Kurdistan a vibrant and strong country. But the problem with being absolutely neutral is that we couldnt openly support Kurds outside of Bashur. We could only be neutral towards them. So no more embargoes on Rojava for example. Neutrality means we can trade with Rojava and Turkey too. Also how possible is it to be absolutely neutral in the Middle East.,kurdistan,d45tzq3,2,t5_2rt31

Besides a very important point I forgot to make earlier HDP losing votes doesnt mean they automatically go to AKP which I showed was only .. There are other Kurdish parties as well and many of them are way more Kurdish nationalistic than HDP.gt There is actually no proper counting of how many kurds are in Turkey so this question is not actually answerable.I definitely wouldnt claim Im  right. But I made an educated guess through these sources. The point of this post was to explain why I think that Turks who here and elsewhere constantly claim that the majority of Kurds voted AKP are wrong. I would like to see their sources and why they think they are correct but I still havent seen anything. The second table shows that way more votes came from MHP in November.,kurdistan,d7fp72m,3,t5_2rt31

On the other hand they are probably the group with the biggest problems in terms of being disproportionally represented in crime and unemployment statistics and there has been a very large growth of their numbers in recent decades due to family immigration from Morrocco with regards to that point it shouldnt be racist to say you want less of them. They are also the largest ethnic group among Dutch and Belgian jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq.

Then ofc the ideology of PKK has become much more than that in recent years and could in some future come to a point where it no longer needs to reflect the Kemalist narrative.On the other hand the KDP really lacks an ideology altogether theyre basically a clan and not much more. There are some high level members now in the politburo etc that are slowly forming one. But their main way of viewing the world seems to be through feodalism and tribalism.No party is perfect and nor should we look for one to be but unfortunately in Kurdish politics there seems to be a notion of criticism against own party  abandonment of everything party stands for which damages our political and ideological development tremendously,kurdistan,dat6y3m,5,t5_2rt31

It could well be logical to deduce Birzani is a corrupt politican general and businessmen. Based on the fact he hasnt disclosed his finances or how he acquired the capital for his finances. Along with the fact numerous accusations have been levelled against the KDP and Barzani clan. gtThe accuser is the one who bears that burden of proof.I find that remarkly funny Im not accusing Im simply questioning his claims. Secondly you just moved the goalpost you were happy to defend Barzani and not question my acusations when you were quoting Rudaw and Sirwan. Now all of a sudden you changed and decided to call the burden of proof fallacy on me. How ironic. gtYour citation states the obvious that there were Peshmerga forces in Shingal some of whom were commanders. Then it further states that in fact there was no order to withdraw only negligence. The citation both provides no evidence for your assertion and actively contradicts your claim.I want you to read this extract from the source I provided WORD FOR WORD READ CAREFULLYgtWe were in close communication with the .th Division of the KDP and Peshmerga and informed them about the events. We called them several times. They told us that reinforcement was on the way saying that they would arrive every moment Haci Qeyrani continued. The KDP politburo asks the Yezidis to hold their positions and put up resistance until the Peshmerga arrive. The Yezidis in Siba and Gir Izer also summon the Black Unit of Sheikh Alo Doski which is stationed only a few kilometres away to provide support.In reality however not a single Peshmerga is on the way. The commander of the Black Unit later stated that he had not received the order to dispatch his men although the Yezidis had informed the th KDP division and Peshmerga commanders. The Yezidis in Siba and Gir Izer continue to fight until the early hours of the morning. We fought for about four hours and not a single unit came to our support says Heci Qeyrani who was fighting in Siba.They told us to continue to fight until the Peshmerga would arrive. At that time all Peshmerga had been already running away and setting out to Rabia editors note border with Syria in the northeast of Shingal which is located  kilometres away.NOTICE how the KDP Peshmerga commanders purposely decieved the Yezidi fighters claiming they would come when infact this was a clear and organizeed retreat. Go to  and it tells you everythingNotice here the Peshmerga were saying we will not answer to the reporters question on why they were leaving Shingal. Its clear they recieved a gag order from the top military commanders of the KDP. gtARAnews.net Iraqi Kurdistan To Pay Peshmerga SalariesAlArabiya Peshmerga Soldiers Count Their Money After Receiving SalaryWhat evidence do you have that the Peshmerga actually recieved that money? I havent heard firsthand accounts of Peshmerga recieving anything. gtSo you are basically admitting to never having done even the slightest amount of military service correct?It doesnt matter.
