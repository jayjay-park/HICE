5055252,0,t3_3f9h6t,Remember you want to attack the side facing one inferno head on not two and preferably opposite the cc so their cc troops pull your in to the core. Often you will have to settle for the cc off to the side though.   Ive been using variations of this strategy on other shaped bases as well. Ill still put two golems on each side but sometimes use wall breakers instead of side jumps or earthquake instead of middle jump.,reddittango,cuvcl4y,1,t5_2xpif
