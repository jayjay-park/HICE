7732513,0,t3_4l74gp,I assume ure playing the first game. Well early on there really is no need to grind. Id u need to the best way is to beat the teams in taisen route over and over again. Encounters dont really give much xp. Altho i recommend being on part or little above next teams lvl if u like to make ur life easier. And u really dont want the more encounter bracelet.... its the most annoying thing ull experience when walking,inazumaeleven,d3l4re4,1,t5_2txlg

Then when I got access to internet and stuff I saw how the wiki itself is more focused on Japanese namesI actually barely remembered the English names p and the episodes after the first few episodes of aliea academy arc never aired here I decided watch all the Japanese episodes of both series. Got accustomed to Japanese names after that. Thats why I looked for undubspatches that uses Japanese names and maybe voices for games before playing the games. ,inazumaeleven,d67sn53,1,t5_2txlg
