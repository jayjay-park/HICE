While Marth is about spacing safely to connect with the tip of his sword which is known as a tipper Roy instead hits with the middle of his blade requiring him to get closer to the opponent to deal the most damage.Also their physics are vastly different Marth has lower traction AKA longer wavedash generally moves faster and falls much slower while Roy is one of the fastest falling characters in the game at least in Melee is considered to be a faster attacker due to his lower short hop and much better SHFFL and possess much more endlag on his moves than Marth does.,SSBPM,cei8z2w,8,t5_2u3tn

163722,0,t1_cex04mk,Ikes dtilt is the very bottom just as low as Marth and Roys. The combo is easy to DI out of. If Ally played PM more regularly and was aware of crouch canceling he would have been able to take much greater advantage of that match. Im certain the match up is in Ikes favor Ally just doesnt do enough mix ups and is unaware of all the techniques in the game. If he just grabbed Roy instead of constantly letting himself get CCd he could have immediately started comboing Roy with a lot of tilts and aerials and Roy would have been off stage really quickly where Ike can easily gimp him with even a weak hit. Roy and Ike have comprable wavedashes. Ike is much faster than Roy because of Quick Draw Ike will be in your face before Roy can. Roy is still significantly slower than Marth and Ike.

I sometimes mix in ftilts for shield pressure and for the chance that I can smack them if they decide to jump out of shield. Other than that my neutral game is like  cold chilling around platforms waiting and baiting while fishing with his faster stuff like Bair Nair and quickdraw WDs. I find that I do best between close to mid range where I can threaten quickdraw attack dash cancelled jabs grabs and shffl Nairmax range Fair.Any uncommon things that other Ike mains out there employ?

266313,0,t3_1x4ang,I may have an idea about what is aesthetically unappealing about this boxart. First the colors of the silhouettes are unbalanced there is not enough color variation between them you have two extremely similar colors for falcon and roy and they are next to each other while lucario and mewtwo have pretty different colors. The color variation of lucario and mewtwo looks good. The color similarity of falcon and roy looks bad. In my opinion the solution could be to switch the color of either roys or falcons color splatter.The second and bigger problem I see is that the cover art is mainly black and has messy paint this clashes with the clean title slightly and really clashes with the back covers style which is clean white and purpleblue. To put it simply the front and back covers look good on their own but dont really look like they go together.Just my two cents.  ,SSBPM,cf8d33w,1,t5_2u3tn

Might be a proprietary version of Nvidia OpenGL for Nvidia Quadro.Your CPU looks fine. Looking at some documentation it appears that it has a turbo boost up to . GHz which is a pretty big boost. You may want to make sure that its actually doing that boost though instead sitting around at its . GHz clock. You can ensure this happens by going to Power Options and setting it to High Performance. Just to make sure go to Change plan settings next to High performance gt Change advanced power settings gt scroll down to Processor power management gt Minimum processor state. Make sure that  is maxed. Also make sure Maximum processor state is . You can further verify by getting CPUZ another completely free highly precise CPU monitor. Open it up while youre gaming and take a look at your Core Speed and make sure its sitting at . GHz.You have more than enough RAM. Make sure your drivers for your GPU are updated to the most recent.Your temperatures are great. C under load is really good for a laptop.

582467,0,t3_20snhh,Hey I remember watching this set on stream! First off let me say that I think youre snake is beautiful. So game one was great. He was playing a character that is a good matchup for snake and more importantly youre explosive game was very on point. Throughout most of he game you had either a dsmash mine or grenade defending you while you had either a mortar or grenade threatening him and he had C most of the match. Game  started well for the same reasons but it was a much tighter fight for  reasons. Lucas is harder to sticklock down than DK and Disafter started to figure out the matchup and explosive game. He was being a lot smarter about not running into stray mines. What could have helped here would have just been to be a lot smarter with minegrenade placement maybe threaten the ledge abit more and you let out a couple of wiffed fairs that he punished pretty hard. But for the most part your original strategy was working fine the only serious problem came in on the last stock. Almost all explosive play was gone and you got way too focused on killing him that you started going in dangerously a lot with aerials when you should have laid back and let an explosive kill him.Game  was ok. Mostly what I noticed was that Disafter was doing a way better job of keeping you preoccupied with his pressure so you had less chances to get him in item traps. In this situation I would have resorted to a few options. Up B out of shield is a good way to get people of you and using snakes jabtilt game which may not be preferred  but certainly isnt terrible. Side note that moment game  where you walked him into the mine on the platform above you was a mixture of hilarious and genius.Hope I helped ,SSBPM,cg6hbgt,3,t5_2u3tn

The route of his upb is so telegraphed that you could draw his path on the screen with a pen before he even inputs it and still gimp him out of it.

1052454,0,t3_26541i,eek. Theres a huge cost of entry just into this discussion. Your post is so long... and it could been edited down to its main ideas to promote a more focused discussion. Anyways. Your analysis of star techniques is incomplete. Pointing out that Mewtwo has techniques that used to be unique to another character isnt enough to show his imbalance. The discussion here is lacking. And I think the only one that holds weight anyways is floating. DJC wasnt unique to NessLucas. See Yoshi. Mewtwos had a strong upthrow since melee. If anything Lucas is stealing that move from Mewtwo. A disjointed hitbox isnt a technique. And its not unique enough to count for this. Etc.. This is your best section. Im not sure what you mean on Best in Slot movesets. But your discussion on Uair Bair Dtilt Ftilt Utilt is worth further analysis. Mewtwo definitely needed to be improved from his melee iteration and improvements to Uair Bair Dtilt Ftilt Utilt were necessary but the degree to which those moves are changed is a worthwhile discussion. . Oh my your MewKing sections seems off base. MewKing loves Mewtwo. Thats it. Thats why he goes by MewKing. He even lovesloved Mewtwo in Melee but doesnt use him very much because he isnt very good in melee. He does use top level characters in melee and brawl. But he also contributed to the fact that those character areremain top tier. Hes also on record as saying that mewtwo is like...midtier or something maybe lowtier. I forget. Someone will correct me anyways. He does argue that Mewtwo is spectacular against fastfallers in project m but that still doesnt contribute to Mewtwos imbalance. If anything its a discussion on Mewtwos good matchups. I seem to recall MewKing arguing that Link and Ness are the imbalanced characters in project m. So there you go.  ,SSBPM,chnx32y,7,t5_2u3tn

Controls space above Roy via shuffled uairs really well racks up damage sets up for kills...The three most important things for a Roy player IMO.... Spacing. A slight missspace can mean the difference between an uair setting up for your combo into a kill and getting punished for being in a bad position afterwards. Abusing maximum range while still landing the sweetspot is paramount. . Movement. Roy isnt really that hard as far as tech skill goes but it still takes a long time for someone to push Roy into the speed that he should be moving at especially if its a new player who isnt practicing it. Protip you should practice movement. Alot. Ill lump recovery in with this. And . Ledgedashing. Being able to wavedash onto the stage from the ledge with invulnerability is an extremely powerful tool especially since Roy can get stuff like a dsmash out before the invuln goes away if done properly.

1563588,0,t1_cjbs37z,Youre the only person thats defining rushdown as blind aggression lacking control or not playing smart which is wrong.Rushdown playstyle focuses on pushing the neutral game in your advantage by putting constant pressure on your opponent. That pressure isnt always aimed directly at the opponent where they can shield grab punish. You can attack around their space to stuff out their mobility options. You can space your attack on their shield to make your attacks safe. You can go for lowrisk soft reads that cover multiple options. By keeping pressure on the opponent it makes it harder for them to reset the situation and regain momentum. Aggression being blindstupid is dependent on the player and not inherent to the term rushdown.The reason the spacies and Lucas are often brought up as rushdown characters is because they have shines which can create safe shield pressure thus mitigating the risk of attacking up close.,SSBPM,cjc9oek,5,t5_2u3tn

Its intimidating to go to your first tournament especially if you dont know anyone there but the smash community in general is friendly. Dont be afraid to ask people for friendlies or advice the worst thing that can happen is they say no!Another piece of advice I can give is dont be afraid to lose. Pretty much no one ever wins the first tournament they go to. I got dead last at mine! Dont be too hard on yourself if you do drop out even early take all the matches than you can get as learning experiences. Try to figure out what it was your opponents were doing to beat you and make a mental note to find out what you can do about it. Mental fortitude is extremely important for the long run!,SSBPM,cjevtqi,14,t5_2u3tn

1709948,0,t1_cjujz2w,Personally I love Green Hill Zone. Nayrus gets a lot of utility there plus the relative openness of the stage makes it pretty easy to set up Dins so long as you arent facing a super pressure heavy character. Plus its a good stage to set up combos like ftilt gt usmash gt bair the moving platform doesnt really get in the way and if it does you can just read their getup on the platform and punish accordingly. In general though Zelda likes her space with a couple exceptional matchups mostly characters with a superior projectiles Samus Link and to a lesser extent Mario and Falco. Its tough to deal with these characters on larger stages unless your powershield game is good. Nayrus isnt that reliable of a reflector most of the time especially after youve already reflected one projectile so focus on better movement and smart approaches instead.,SSBPM,cjup8r4,4,t5_2u3tn

1727827,0,t1_cjwugf2,Literally everything about the two characters is completely different from each other. It doesnt stop at Fair and movement speed. Ganon can retain invincibility on the ledge because of the perfect combination of regular fall speed  double jump height and use any aerial at will with that invincibility. Falcons uair doesnt have the sweet knockback angle on the back end of it that Ganon has. Falcons sideB isnt a command grab that can dunk people off the stage like Michael Jordan himself. Ganons dtilt reaches farther and his foot is disjointed. Ganons Ftilt reaches further and his foot is disjointed. Ganons single awesome jab can very easily combo into a DACUS which Falcon cant do. Falcons downB doesnt punish tech rolls nearly as hard as Ganons.Ganondorf himself didnt exist until OoT and Im pretty sure that was released less than  years ago. Either way there isnt much use worrying about what he does in other games. If that was the case wed have a major problem with Peach and Sheik on our hands. Its hilarious to me that non Ganon mains want him changed so badly when practically  Ganon mains actually do outside of a unique movement or defense option.,SSBPM,cjwyh24,0,t5_2u3tn

He is better against characters he can rushdown well like Ganon and Bowser but his matchups against PM top tiers like Fox Falco M Mario are all at least marginally worse than Marths.Id like to mention that most of the responses here arent from Roy mains and while this may not be entirely the reason Ive been in so many situations where I hear people overestimate other characters because they personally have a tough time against the matchup or play someone who is better than them and mains the character.I never said he was bad but in the current environment of PM especially with most characters having nuts recoveries there are plenty of characters overall better than him.

1960565,0,t1_ckp4wck,Fox Falco and Jiggly are definitely not easier to play.Now yes from the objective perspective of required tech skill to play the classes on a high level yes the spacies are hard to play.But to WIN with those characters at the high level is a lot easier to do then winning with Sheik. CF Peach and Marth are debatable since they struggle as well.Sheik is a top tier character who absolutely destroys below her In Melee. In PM they even took her chaingrabbing prowress away. And she cant live off of gimps anymore either. Problem is shes actually very hard to win with against spacies and other top tiers who are being played by dedicated main. So you cant just pick her up and win against dedicated Lucas or whatever.Idk if thats the best answer. may udarkatma might give better insight,SSBPM,ckpg7m0,1,t5_2u3tn

1973129,0,t3_2h9p02,Be careful of when to use your double jump look for when theyre going for the double jump.. I know in the beginning you were getting a feel for how Ike was recovering back to stage and his options.. and later on you punished him for not sweetspotting the edge with a knee at the end which is good but make sure you understand that you can be intercepted by a fair or uair from Ike and thats dangerous knowing that you may go offstage when youre higher  when getting hit by a fair or whatever and you only have side b or up b as an option to get back onto stage. So dont use double jump carelessly is the point Im trying to make. And dont throw out useless moves when the opponent doesnt feel any pressure.. like the random dairs on the platform.. if Ike was looking out for the moves you were going to make he could make a decision to predict where youre going to land or just go up and pressure right after the move you just did actually giving him some stage control or presencepressure.. so also be careful on the fact that if theres no reason to throw out a move its probably best not to throw it out unless its a read on your part.,SSBPM,ckqynpb,1,t5_2u3tn

Make sure you do things for a reason and sort of reactively rather than just going in without thinking. Most early falcons just long jump in with an aerial and most people catch it from a mile away.

2192933,0,t1_clhzrjp,As a mainly PM player who has been getting into Melee a lot more recently another big thing is that PM doesnt have nearly as many nuances as Melee has. In PM each character was developed with a specific playstyle in mind with moves that were design to lead into other attacks and what not. Currently in PM you dont have to worry as much about spacing or percentages when doing combos as followups are generally pretty straight forward and streamlined compared to Melee. Now Im not definitely not saying that PM has autocombos as some people like to call them as they definitely require character knowledge experience and technical skill to pull off but just generally its more apparent what the correct followup is in any given situation. I also think this is what most people are trying to say when they say that PM is gimmicky.I still love PM Lucas in PM is by far my favorite character to play in any smash game and the PMBR has said that theyre changing a lot of attacks to have knockback that scales with percentage rather than set knockback which will hopefully address what Im talking about. I dont know whether the PMBR is capable of intentionally making the game have the same level of... unintentionalness? that Melee has nor do I know if that would be the best thing for PM but the PMBR does do some incredible work and I for sure will keep supporting and playing the game as long as its still being developed and after.,SSBPM,clikqns,2,t5_2u3tn

If nothing else Marth has to edgeguard you differently. The neutral is pretty bad for you but you should be able to capitalize when it leaves the neutral so take advantage of that by playing footsies better than the marth and you can win. Make him respect your space.Stay just outside of his space dash dancing in and out until he makes a mistake. If he approaches you with fairs or ground attacks that arent safe on shield punish him. You have to have more patience than him. You cant rushdown marth because marth has all the tools in the world to shut that down against characters with laggy attacks. At the same time you have some nice tools to shutdown his rushdown as well so take advantage of that.  ,SSBPM,cm98zh4,1,t5_2u3tn

2420204,0,t3_2n5vjk,Sheik punishes a ton of the bad habits PM players develop mainly pressing too many buttons in neutral be cause she is bad fucking ass at whiff punishing. If you whiff anything in neutral you can likely get boost grabbed or dash attacked. Another one is about your double jump when recovering. Do not try to just jump to ledge when around a  degreeish angle below the stage or jump high back to stage because needles will steal your jump and she can fair you or bair you for free if you jump high. When grabbed its mostly a mind game. If you expect downthrow di down and away from her if you expect bthrow di down and towards her.  On good di you have to worry about tech chases on bad di you can get regrabbed ftilted or faired. The best way to punish sheik is to cc punish dash attack early or dash dance to bait it if you have a good dd. Try to juggle her as she has no safe escape back to the stage from above. If you get her offstage do NOT try to hit her when she recovers. Know her up b range and look at her options. She will either go for sweetspot ledge or above ledge which is beaten by just holding ledge. If she goes for the safe option of up b on stage you can punish on reaction marth getup walk fsmash foxfalco ledgehop bair etc. If you do standup you might be able to punish up b above ledge if you do it fsst enough.,SSBPM,cmaugst,1,t5_2u3tn

2446898,0,t3_2njfhi,From the side bar Project M TechniquesUniversal advanced techniques include Short Hop Fast Fall Lcanceled SHFFL aerial attacks the wavedash jump canceling grabs and a bunch of others that you should practice and master one at a time. Whatever is more important depends on your playstyle and character but youll want to incorporate as many as you can so that you can play with maximum options on the table. So you will need to spend some time practicing these techniques in training mode.Now realize that this is an endgame goal so dont get too hung up on mastering them right away. Instead also develop fundamentals  good spacing and zoning learning how to recognize and execute punish situations how to recover safely etc. You can only really learn this by playing others and not just the same friends  youll need a variety of different characters and playstyles from your opponents. Find a local scene to play weeklies if you can.Finally remember to have fun. Too many people try too hard too fast and burn out quickly. It will take time to grow good skills so be prepared to get bodied and keep in mind that if you work hard youll be able to body them right back.If you want to learn more Smashboards is THE resource to talk to others about all aspects of all the smash games.Good luck!,SSBPM,cme53b4,3,t5_2u3tn

2668689,0,t3_2qjvu4,Heres some advice I gave someone else for IvygtWhen your opponent tries to ledge hog you should make them fell some pressure. Remember as of . once we tether to that ledge our options are extremely limited. Fairs and Razor leaves should really keep them from feeling safe on the ledge and if youre high enough use seed bomb even but be aware of its high end lag. Even when you tether to the ledge there is almost no reason not to wait out the forced reel in to see if your opponent is going to try to punish you prematurely other than as a mixup but the end lag is rather enormous now so good luck mixing them up on the ledge once youve tethered. But on your last stock in game two where you were in the position where he just stayed on the ledge and waited to see what you would do after youre reeled in and you DId back you retethered. This was your death sentence. When you saw that he did nothing you should have naird or daird he was no longer invisible and you basically had no reason not to attack him. He had you SPOOKED. You need more confidence in your execution. Selfconfidence is the cornerstone to any healthy mindset.gtAlso remember to abuse ledge invincibility. When youre on the ledge you have  real options. Hold back to release from the ledge then jump and you can either jump away from the ledge and throw a razor leaf this is probably the most dangerous and should only be used as a mix up or if your opponent is charging an attack or dash dancing. ALSO this WILL REQUIRE A TETHER so plan accordingly remember we only get  so make SURE you get back on stage after using your tether twice even if you have to roll back on stage Fair while easily the best option if its read you can be easily punished for it so dont overuse it and Nair probably the most difficult to execute but has by far the most reward.gtAs for on the stage you were kinda throwing bairs out without much purpose. I know I catch my self doing this a lot too. Use dtilt and fair for spacing it leads into nair jab and fair. Bair isnt really one of our spacing tools its a kill move it doesnt do a whole lot of damage and leads into exactly nothing. It should only really be used to put your opponent offstage or to kill them offstage. Honestly your entire combo game could use some work. This will take some practice. Use CPUs just set them to level  and just practice like  minutes a few times a week. This wont help with neutral though thats something you have to practice against human players.gtOh and where them upb sweet spots at? Its not guaranteed off of anything anymore but it can still be used as a punish. And what a punish it is. Usually you wanna get it of uthrow at higher damages if they dont DI uthrow or utilt. dthrow is basically the same as . so it still leads into upb very well if they dont DI it.He was asking for advice on a recording of his play  link .

2738006,0,t1_cnf1ala,gtThe . patch needed to come six months ago or be more moderate in changes. Completely changing characters right as Smash  came out basically tells people to just focus on Smash  since now theyre way behind the people whose characters didnt change and they dont have the time to learn both games. The smart players might be patient but the masses went to Smash . This all relegate Project M to Smash  cult status.I agree that it does dissuade many players away having to relearn characters and matchups but if these players alternative is to switch to smash ? Fine. That either tells me that they were only playing PM because its fresh and new or for some other reason I cant figure out.Either way Im going to keep playing PM because I think its the best smash game out there and Im not going to worry about the players that   switch to smash .,SSBPM,cnfasl7,0,t5_2u3tn

2767282,0,t1_cni9qbi,Typically fire mode is considered beneficial against fast fallers and ice mode is good against floaties.It becomes a bit more complex when you look into the missile game because fire missiles have more BKB which means they outright beat moves like Warios shoulder charge or Squirtles side B. Of course the decision on which mode to use in cases like those is dependent upon both players style of play. Ice mode allows you to be a bit more aggressive but you still have solid defensive options like retreating forward air similar to Marth but with a bigger punch. Fire mode kind of forces more defensive play in those match ups because youre trying to fend them off with missiles before moving in for a kill.When it comes to larger character models like Bowser and DK fire mode seems to be the better choice. Theyre far too large to properly SDI out of your multi hit moves so UpSmash and forward air put percent on very quickly. Of course youd fend off DDD quite fine with Ice mode and it would help to finish him off sooner especially because of your buffed aerial killing ability. Theres a lot that factors into which moveset works best but I normally just say Ice for floaties and Fire for FFers. If you look at the neutral game though you kind of see that ice mode feels sort of incomplete because you dont really have access to all of your tools. Forward smash is very clunky and has a lot of end lag and its BKB isnt close to the BKB of fire. Up Smash has a long start up and is meant to punish on platforms or sloppy approaches from above. Down tilt is just outright useless. Everything else about ice mode is fine although its sort of upsetting that they moved the IASA  frames back as well as the auto cancel window  frames back. Fire pretty much has access to the full kit at all times. UpSmash is the only move that can be argued to be relatively useless at times. Fire fsmash has big BKB and is a potent kill move for sure. Dtilt is the ultimate setup game in the world and it leads to upsmash at low percents on ffers falling upairs forward airs or even down airs. Its just an amazing move. Forward air does huge damage and they reduced the BKB on it so it links easier into upair for huge strings of damage. Honestly Im still not fully aware of which beam mode suits which situation best when looking at every possible match up and style of play but thats the fun of this character anyway. Even in Melee she feels relatively underexplored and its really fun to discover new things and be a big part of developing this characters meta.,SSBPM,cnimo6j,2,t5_2u3tn

If you ARE playing an aggro floatie A. Use your projectiles properly dont spam create openings for yourself B. DI away from followup hits. Marth can WRECK characters in the right weight class Floaties  fortunately are not a part of that class C. See the above paragraph and work on your punish game.

You say that Marth feels a bit off in melee well your muscle memory is a little different as the timing between the two games isnt identical if you played someone else you would be learning it all over again which would let you develop new muscle memory and thus eliminate the odd feeling you get when playing.

3168906,0,t1_coqg0x0,I was getting through writing this comment and another thought hit me and that was about matchup knowledge in PM and how it will probably never get to such an indepth level as it is in Melee. The matchup section of Kadanos Marth Guide is so indepth that it makes my head spin. Just imagine trying to memorize all of it as a Marth main. Now imagine that guide multiplied by . First off whos going to write all of that? Whos going to do all of that research and frame data collection? And if anyone does there definitely wont be  people who will. Some characters are bound to be left out and those people will definitely be at a distinct disadvantage of having to learn the matchup data themselves. Matchup Knowledge in PM just isnt to the same depth as in Melee for two reasons its impractical to learn an entire encyclopedia not to mention one thats constantly changing. And its almost not worth it to learn everything because assuming every characters viable learning everything there is to know about a matchup is only applicable to one fourtyoneth of all the games youll ever play.,SSBPM,coqgezj,1,t5_2u3tn

If they shield gyro from across stage you can laser slightly high or mid height depending on whether or not you expect them to jump or WD OoS. Being forced into shield for two projectiles is really frustrating. Once you have them approaching play a mixup game ofa boost approachesrun in dtiltgrounded sidebb CCrun in CCrun in shieldc CC bait into dash back or wavedash backd more projectilesA will beat any approach attempts they make but lose to DD spacing generally speaking circumstances permit B will beat aerialdtilt approaches for a punish and will encourage grab approaches or more patient DDing unless they space well which is why C is good C will beat any laggy approaches especially grabs D will discourage patient DDing and can also stuff badly timed approaches. Itll mostly be up to you to determine how you effectively punish him my preference is trying to get off dsmashes and grabs for dthrows. Dthrow can lead into uair carries and fair chains both to rack up damage and push them offstage dsmash if badly DId does the same thing and if DId well forces them to give up the stage and expend a double jump to escape a staggered combo. For edgeguards force low recoveries with projectiles then stall with sideb on the ledge until he upbs. You can then climb up for either an edgehog or a punish depending on whether they go for the ledge or the stage.,SSBPM,cpc586d,2,t5_2u3tn

3478516,0,t1_cpooy6a,Design is different than power tho. He has too many safe options and multiple options of recovery. Out of the top  of melee hes can actually land out of his UpB on stage with no lag. No other character in the top  has that.He also has the best vertical kill moves that negates everyones recovery options. Fox is the only character in melee that has a viable vertical kill moves and that alone gives him a huge advantage over the rest of the cast who dont. People undervalue the vertical kill potential at  with easy setups. Not many characters can claim that.,SSBPM,cporyld,7,t5_2u3tn
3481433,0,t3_304adt,I honestly think the mistake isnt exactly a mistake at all but a design issue that changes how effective the characters are Ease of play.Project Ms easier controls and more lenient timings make it easier to play characters at a consistent high level. Add in PMs customizable controls and all of a sudden tech skill is easy and comfortable to anyone who puts in the time. Consistently doing Foxs shield pressure is sooo much easier in PM than it is in melee and partially why we see Fox in such a powerful position.I dont know if its possible but making Foxs tech skill as hard as it is in melee is the best way to balance him. More inconsistency leads to more punishes which leads to a more balanced character.As much as I like the idea of making a game easier to execute I believe the spacies present a real exception where making a game hard to play makes it more balanced.Edit So the question is do we make Fox harder to play or do we nerf some part of his kit? Or does Fox even need a nerf? Im of the opinion that we should wait for other characters metas to develop and maybe  patches from now look into changing Fox if hes still dominant. Like I said before I think the best balance change would be to revert his control leniency to melee levels but that might not be possible due to engine limits. If thats the case then nerfing part of Foxs kit would require some discussion.,SSBPM,cpp3xa1,-1,t5_2u3tn

Make sure you can boot PM through the Cfg USB loader I believe for these specific steps to work the USB storage needs to be FAT formatted with Brawl stored as wbfs files. If yours if formatted as NTFS or WBFS then the launcher file may need to be modified to work. Install Priiloader. Download and unzip this file and place it in the apps directory on your SD card. Verify that it works through the normal Homebrew launcher.

Since the Wii U mode behaves exactly like the official Gamecube adapter you cant use it on a version of Dolphin older than .xxxx so youll have to use the PC mode and bind the controls yourself on Dolphin .. If you want rumble press the empty box under Rumble Motors and set it to either Constant or Sine.Alternatively you could use the latest version of Dolphin and use the adapter on Wii U natively.

3646607,0,t3_3243vo,Muh soundpackSong ListDownload LinkSome of you have seen it before but Ive never really given rationales for choices. A lot of it is born out of personal nostalgia. Pretty much every song you see from the N is there because it comes from a game that I love. I tried to pay respects to as many franchises and genres as I could while at least trying to have every stage feature one or more songs from its original franchise. Stages without a game to reference I tried to fit to a musical theme. Battlefield is focused on orchestral songs and FD is all heavy metal. Certain songs are meta references to PM itself. The Concept of Love was added to GHZ due to Sonics JSRF alt. Autumns Fading Sun also on GHZ was the . trailer music.Theres a lot of Shovel Knight music in my pack which was grandfathered in because the entire pack originated as an allSK pack. I give Jake Kaufman lots of love in general because hes perfect. Double Dragon Neon Shantae Mighty Switch Force and of course Shovel Knight. I also call out to several other indies because their soundtracks are so good they deserve respect.Naturally I tried to fit the theme of each stage as much as I could even if franchises get mistmatched. Like how Tallon Overworld is on Distant Planet or Wrath of the Reset Bomb is on Lylat Cruise. Despite being from franchises that have stage representation they feel like better fits for the stages I placed them on.Some songs were purely for fun or crowd favorite purposes. Miror Bs theme Ducktales Moon Rules of Nature Beep Block Skyway all fit that definition pretty well.I put a lot of thought and love into this pack and Im planning a big update for ..

3756198,0,t3_33fhw3,The marth was pretty good.  Hesitated a bit too often and it usually cost him an edgeguard.  Namely around the  minute mark.  Had you not wanted to end the stock and dtilted the recovery instead of trying to fsmash followup off of down throw you couldve had a clean lead.  Overall your movement is good you know how to end your combos but just try to learn to hesitate a bit less.  Part of it is comfortability so that comes in time.The Link isnt bad.  He goes for a bit too much grab and up b as an ender when it wont really kill a few times.  Might have been a tech flub but yeah.  Marth is a weird weight so you dont really get uair juggles on him easy but be ready to on bad DI.  He also had trouble once you got in his space and he wasnt able to zone you out anymore.  I would suggest to him abuse uair more on tech chases on platforms throw boomerangs on grounded tech chases so they have to think Do I shield the boomerang and risk getting grabbed or jump over it and risk getting hit by a bombnairfair.

Its also the fastest method of throwing a grenade barring grenade pull gt shield gt shield drop gt Z pickupair dodge gt throw grenade and the standard B grenade throws. In exchange for the slower throw compared to regular B grenade throws you keep your momentum while throwing.  for the thread in case anyone else cares to read about it.In any case in many matchups especially Snake vs. Jiggs or vs. Marth its really useful as a get out of my space move if they know how to poke around your grenade which not many people know how to do well admittedly or a laggy wavedash with a extended defensive hitbox. It could also be useful as an approach toolDACUS substituteDACUS supplement since you maintain momentum while throwing though Im no longer consistent enough with it to use it reliably in that sense and I still cant get the DACUS timing right.Theres also the niche use of look cool by jumping over all of the SHDLs while chucking a grenade.There are probably some other applications but theyre either of questionable use or Im still trying to figure out how to incorporate them into gameplay.

3811033,0,t1_cqq2stq,. I end up valuing different things in different engines and dont have feelings for any particular character so I dont really have any consistant mains. In  I mained uair whos more colloquially known as Captain Falcon but rarely play the game. In Melee which I still play sometimes I main Falco.When I played Brawl I mained Ike and then switched to Metaknight when I inevitably lost. In my brief run with Smash  I mained Dedede and the most annoying of Villagers whom I made worse by constantly trash talking my opponent in a Skeletoresque supervillain voice mid match.. I always suspected Jigglypuff was unpopular largely because she was boring rather than as a result of being very underpowered. Who would want to play bair rest when you could play as someone really cool like Squirtle? If I changed Puff Id want a big redesign moving her away from rest and bair and making her underused moves meaningful and fun. I really dont know what specific changes Id make though because thats a pretty big task.. Ill enjoy any music maybe because Im an amateur songwriter myself but I always gravitated towards Rock. Electronic rock alternative rock any kind of Rock really. Some of my favorite bands right now include TV on the Radio The Killers and Tally Hall among others.. Id like to see a tropical Ivysaur with a hibiscus for a bud and little flower shapes decorating her instead of triangles and maybe a sunny yellow body color scheme since theres not a lot of yellow in the game.. Ham and Cheese sandwiches. Milk.. I definitely remember you  youre a cool dude. I liked that you seemed like a critical thinker about the game.. Im not a very big gamer outside of smash but Team Fortress  FTL and a handful of SNES games like LTTP have entertained me for a long time. I like difficult games. Because of that I tend to like multiplayer versus games a lot since by the nature of competing with an equally capable human being theyre bound to be challenging.. I try to go to as many tournaments as I can so Im bound to see you around at one. I go to Symbiote and SOD regularly still.. I think Ivysaur is in a pretty good place right now. I dont think shes particularly overpowered or underpowered. I definitely dont want to nerf her as a character and harm her viability but wouldnt be against nerfing specific moves if theres a problem with them. I really dont have any actual plans for Ivy at this moment. I want to let her sit in the meta for a while longer before I make any decisions.Thanks for stopping by dude. I appreciate it.

There is a massive opportunity cost to mastering two characters that have very few dominant matchups so I think there should be a meaningful reward if you do master both characters. Transform as an option adds more value as an interesting mechanic with a high skill ceiling than it takes away from competitive best of x formats.I would be more agreeable to arguments revolving around adding value with welldesigned interesting moves to replace transform which outweigh the current asymmetric character design.,SSBPM,cqs61j1,3,t5_2u3tn

3827597,0,t3_349rid,There comes a time when a person is so dedicated to their trade that they are willing to break established grounds in order to seek betterment of what they do. This is an example of one of those times.When the design for Hyrule Warriors Link first came out it was met with universal praise. However among the design one stuck out the most over everything else.The Scarf.The scarf instantly acquired a cult following. People were obsessed with the scarf creating replicas immediately and trying everything in their power to obtain it. Its rise in popularity even prompted Nintendo and Koei Tecmo to include it in their limited edition versions.Its safe to say that the scarf is a huge aspect of HW Links design. As such when the majority of the influx of HW Link texture hacks came in without apply any real physics for the scarf the level of depth for those could best be described as decent at best.This texture takes the cake. The best part of the texture is that it does NOT need an alternative FitLinkMotionEtc or FitLink file just to animate the scarf. All of the textures have quality scarf animations and physics.Of course nothing is perfect and no textures are without its faults. However among the numerous HW Link textures in the vault this particular one is king of kings.Now if only someone could make a texture of Hyrule Warriors Ganondorf with similar physics for his ravishing long hair. I would instantly change into a Ganon main in a heartbeat.Before you worried lot ask even though it is described as an Import it does work without issue for Project M...despite the fact that it does lag when four HW Links are playing. But then again whos going to do a Four Sword mirror match with Link huh?

I disagree based on your reply. Its exactly the kind of thing I wanted to start discussion about and its exactly the kind of replies I like to read. Helps me and others like me understand from the perspective of others and players who main the particular character in question such as yourself. From the replies here I realize that while players like dont particularly enjoy the change from fast page fighting to a more defensive and slower play I can understand how some players welcome and enjoy these radically different playstyles.Another point that I was trying to raise from my post is how I personally felt that Zeldas moveset is too defensively focused in a game where a majority of characters are rewarded on aggression rather then unaggression. And while I still dislike it I do see that its completely fair for that kind of playstyle to exist in this game for those who fit this style. EDIT just to add on your first point I understand that fighting games should definitely offer more playstyles but that doesnt mean in my opinion and for lack of a better word boring playstyles should exist for varieties sake. ,SSBPM,cqylg7d,10,t5_2u3tn

4060281,0,t3_36xjqo,First off lets get something straight. As a Fox player you have the tools to win EVERY matchup in the game. So no johns about character matchupslooking at you GodTouch some matchups may be harder but there are  that are just straight up unwinnable. Id honestly put every matchup in the game at  or higher for Fox.So first thing you need to dowhich you did was fix your lasering in the neutral. STOP lasering in neutral against Ike. Some characters its OK against to bait approach but for the most part avoid it and focus on your neutral.You need to work on your dash dancing its absolutely essential and you also need to understand spacing. That is make sure to always know and understand and respect your opponents space there are also sometimes where you can GO underneath your opponent during startup frames of an attack if you read.  For example if you read an Ike fair you can literally just run underneath him and bair him which can lead into followups.Practice your tech skill. You flubbed a lot of waveshine usmashes. This should never happen. As a new Fox it may be hard but keep at it. If you play a lot and keep playing for about a year youll get it consistent to the point where you dont need to think about it and youll always get it.Running shine is strong. It stops aerials with large startup stops jab strings stops anything you want it to really. Use it practice it. Watch some top level melee play specifically Marths v Fox and see how the Fox plays. One of the best things to do with running shine is if theyre stuck in the corner running shine into their space then full hop Nair. This will almost ALWAYS hit them as they feel threatened and will try to retreat to the platform or hit you with a tilt or grabwhich you avoid by fullhoping. This also baits the run off bair as you can shinespike them if they try to do it. And if they try to attack then you can drop through platform any aerial and confirm it into grab.Practice shuffling all your aerials super super fast on the ground. As fast as humanly possible. Seriously. You should be practicing this till your fingers fall off. Then practice it on shield. I personally use Melee XX to do this as PM doesnt have anything good for it and I mainly play Melee anyways.Fox has nasty combos on Ike that dont involve shine. You can literally just Nair him about  times into uair or Nair twice into a grab into uthrow uair. Work on those shuffles. You should be able to carry people with shuffle nairs across the stage.Learn to JC grab and finally also learn to use aerials to confirm into grabs. You can get grabs off of wave shines. Thats Foxs most valuable tool. Use it often.Jeez that was a lot to type from a phone lol.Oh and CC CC EVERYTHING. Just crouch cancel everything get good at crouch canceling everything and acting immediately out of it and doing things other than spamming smash attacks or shine out of it. A lot of Ikes attacks you can CC them and then running aerial them after taking the hit. Get good at CC and know when and when not to use it.The other thing you should definitely aim MUCH higher for l cancel percents at least  per game. Dont aim lower than that. Land those l cancels.Also accidental fullhops is a valid mixup. Fullhop with fox is scary good and underrated do not be afraid to use it ,SSBPM,crj3or3,2,t5_2u3tn

Id like to make her sing move viable though.  Give it a bigger area of effect and have their sleepy state last longer even if mashing.gt Favorite genre of music and artists from said genre?I listen to a lot of EDM mashup mega mix stuff most of the time.... so its always a mess of artists.  Stuff like this is what I usually listen to especially while working. No breaks in the song means that I dont get distracted by what song is coming on next.gt Whats a costume youd love to see put into Project M regardless of its chance to be included in an official build?gt Favorite sandwich and drink?Theres a Canadian sports bar called The Angry Beaver that serves The Angry Burger that is just a fantastic burger with ghost pepper cheese on it.  Im a sucker for spicy things and this thing is the best.  I get it with a black bean patty.gt Favorite thing about Project M as a whole?The community and how inviting the players are.  Im still fairly fresh to playing in the competitive scene Ive been PMDev since March  only started competing around February this year. and its awesome to hang out with all these people who are just trying to get better at something.  Seeing people work hard to reach their goals is always a pretty awesome thing to me.  Even if their goals are just I want to get better at wavedashing.gt Do you play other games outside of Smash? If so which ones and why?Ive been sucked into Destiny again on Xbox One.  Spent four hours last night trying to kill Skolas with two of my friends we failed.I play Halo  Classic quite a bit as well. This game was my jam back in the day I had played over  games of multiplayer on the original Xbox and to be able to play that game again is pretty awesome for me when it actually works...Im also  on the Xbox leaderboards for Tony Hawks Pro Skater Hd for overall score.I also want to play more Dance Dance Revolution.  I used to be pretty good at it.gt Could we see a full release for . within  months? Or do you believe it will take longer than that?Soontmgt Whats your favorite contribution to Project M that youve made so far?Bowsers Castle is a pretty big deal for me.  It is the first stage that Ive seen that has custom lightmaps baked into the stage its the first stage with entirely custom hazards and I did it all while staying with a pretty low triangle budget.  Its a neat stage for a lot of reasons to me.  gt What was your job that you quit?I used to be the lead of a QA team doing cell phone testing for a caller ID software company.  It was a really neat job with a lot of awesome people and they paid me way more than they probably should have.  I worked there for two years before saving up enough cash to try to help support myself while I work on my art. I moved in with my girlfriend at the same time and so shes still a bit disappointed that I gave up that job but she fully supports me in trying to pursue my dreams of being an environment artist for games.gtThank you for all of the effort that you have put into this nearing perfect game!

4465797,0,t3_3bxzr0, This is my first real analytical comment but here goes. I agree that the ness community is a silent one. Saying that i believe that ness is a strong character with tons of untapped potential. As a Ness main one of my favorite things about Ness is the ability to go deep off stage punish and make it back safely. he has strong smashes with great coverage an fsmash with a sweet spot strong aerials including a meteor a disjoint a sweet spot bair that hits hard and has kill potential and a strong uair that i feel is underused in the ness match ups i see but can kill floaties easy he has IMO the best projectiles in the game pk fire which when it hits basically guarantees either a grab and follow ups a kill at high s or a way to rack up damage quickly pk thunder  has the ability to stun opponents far offstage and gimp them when hit by the tail or if recovering low has the potential to stage spike them due to the way it pulls the opponent in you can also keep opponents up in the air with it racking up little bits of damage somewhat safely then there is pk thunder two with its ridiculous reach which i love but the ways you can angle ness with it and its massive kill power it is a great tool idk if a lot of ness mains know this but it is a secret stylish tech that i use to sneakily get one kill any given set but you basically stand on the edge of the stage and activate pk thunder  and instead of hitting yourself toward your opponent which at this point will be in shield ready to punish you you deliberately miss going above your head and circle around again pk thunder will be of screen your opponent will believe it has ended drop their shield and approach and during the second loop you hit yourself at them sometime killing the there pk flash which is great for punishing anyone recovering far horizontally or low sweet spot like dk bowser or marth falcon spacies and ike. Another tech which I have been in the lab practicing which stems from harmaks ex fire called pdefspdfs platform drop ex fire is a great mix up tool and can often catch a grounded opponent off its basically the same principle but instead of short hopping and waiting  frames you just drop from a low platform and input a quarter circle sideb in order to achieve an ex fire its faster and easier the only draw back is its stage specific because of the high of each stages platform on top of that each stage has its own frame to hit side be heres a list of the one I know it works on and what frame to hit sideb on dream land side platform on frame  or when nesss head is inside the platform same goes for smashville ps  normal transformation on frame  or when nesss head hits top of platform this is also true for wario ware. On top of all of this you also have djc aerials and rising arias and chain grabs on most of the cast strong tilts and a jab that hits slightly behind you ness is an amazing character and should receive more love on the pm sub reddit.,SSBPM,cstla8l,1,t5_2u3tn

4470781,0,t1_csu7q52,It helps to recover if you do side b multiple times but the first time you do it is the only time you go completely sideways with no gravity affecting you. I should have been specific lol. Side b to uptilt works at higher percent. When Marth cant get a kill at around  it really shines since you can do it out of dash dance and its a low commitment move. I know on Peach you can get a side b to grab combo at low percents though. Thats a thing. Ill have to try that out on more characters. ,SSBPM,csu7s7f,4,t5_2u3tn

4477292,0,t1_csup8yz,Well since a bit of what Ive said has been kinda overblown and the context ripped from it as well heres an opportunity to actually discuss something interesting.For some reason this was bothering enough people for it to show up on my feed. People who I normally consider to be quite reasonable folks too.So this somehow touched a nerve with folks it could be smart to introspect and look at the community and ask why. Is there a particular element of it that could be handled better? Are people so used to esports commentary that when they run into something outside the norm they react more harshly to it now? I was actually hoping for a discussion like THAT which is why I brought it up in the first place. I dont think this was an imprisonable offense or something it just was an odd moment folks were complaining about that I wanted to bring up here.If these people who have the ability to leave an impression on people are complaining about what theyre hearing especially newcomers or this kind of thing would turn away newcomers and more viewers for PM its worth talking about.,SSBPM,csv15ze,1,t5_2u3tn

4483739,0,t1_csvtlno,While Im not super well read on Yoshi nerfs Lucario had the potential to become incredibly broken and IPK has already shown that the nerfs while detrimental really havent crippled or neutered the character nearly as much as people think. Also Roy was HEAVILY nerfed more so than sheik. Sheik lost a DI mixup while the rest of her kit remained intact. Roys up b hang time was drastically reduced and his down tilt was rebalanced to be less ridiculous. Also to say that Marth is a top tier in PM is a little much. He has generally even spreads against the cast but so many characters now have tools that are effective at contesting space as well as challenging disjoint. He is still of course a fundamentally solid character but he really isnt as dominant as he was in melee. EDIT spelling...,SSBPM,csvua0n,1,t5_2u3tn

Some matchups Marth has might be even but only if you change your playstyle to better suit the character. As a smash player Ive come to learn that subtle changes based on character matchup and player matchup are always needed. As a Marth main Ive come to realize that to master this character you need to be able to change A LOT of things about your gameplay if you want to be relevant from character to character. Some characters can camp you hard. Some characters can match your range. Some characters are faster than you. Some characters are too floaty to combo reliably. Some characters are too heavy to grab into juggles. Some characters can CC your fair at . The thing is Ive yet to have this problem with my secondary Falco. The only difference is usually I change my combo moves but the general game plan stays the same. For Marth you have to counter each thing in a different way. As a Marth main your matchups arent always as clear cut as people make it out to be. Dont hate on this dude for attempting to try to understand a matchup better.

4780598,0,t1_ctwxuc1,No the autocancel window is tied to the animation itself as in what frame its on. The animation doesnt advance while your in hitlag youre just frozen until its over unless you got hit and can SDI. So hitting shield doesnt provide you any more or any less air time or change anything from being possible or not possible concerning autocancelsdouble aerials you just have to time the nd aerial later now because of being frozen for that short amount of time.Lcancelling on the other hand  in Melee is affected by hitlag as its not tied to the animation. In PM though since it was coded in differently apparently its not like Melee and hitlag doesnt affect it its tied to the animation? so its apparently easier to Lcancel in PM as hitmissing the aerial doesnt affect the window. Im not certain on that though as thats more of a recent discovery I somehow made. ,SSBPM,ctx4vd2,2,t5_2u3tn
4781219,0,t3_3gbco7,I watched the loss and I think the main issue is that it can be really difficult for people unfamiliar with spacies to play against themmyself included. They are going to be pushing a lot of buttons and you just need to keep your focus. When you get an opportunity you need to be able to slow down and cover their options i.e. gotta work on the punish game. I saw a couple of times the fox did a straight vertical up b and all you did was charge an up smash that wasnt going to land. Again I think the issue is that it is easy to get flustered when Fox or Falco are air shining or laser approaching so when you finally do get the opening you feel like you need to act right away when in actuality you could get up and grab a drink in the amount of time it takes for their up B to finish charging. Specifically as Sheikin those situations you can just fall off stage DJ fairbair and Fox is done. All in all it seems like you have good tech skill you just need to try to slow down the match try to bait their Nair approach and have a plan to punish them accordingly. ,SSBPM,ctx7okh,1,t5_2u3tn

MTitle Animal Crossing ver. M a.m. Animal Crossing Wild World ver. MMenu MThis uses Brawls and Smash s rather consistent format with a few exceptions that seem to be oversights such as  a.m. which was not indicated in Brawl and is attributed to the wrong game in Smash  of the followingunique theme names dont necessarily indicate game of origincommon level theme names indicate game of originVer. X is placed after the game title if applicable for when there are multiple remixes of a song or there is a new remix of a song previously remixed and included although in PMs case its probably for the best if all custom remixes including the two I didnt place it on above have this at the end for clarification of what is newthe two new Brawl menu themes were called Menu  and Menu  while Melees Menu was Menu Melee. Since the new menu theme is not ported Menu M feels the most consistent especially since it overwrites Menu  in the first place. A possible alternative is since Project M currently has two unique themes to have it be Menu Project M and have Metal Cavern be Metal Cavern Project M.Bad Mario and Kicks Twilite Funk the remix names would be listed in the Songs Replaced list alongside the ingame name in the list and on Youtube but not visible on the normal song list.

5502972,0,t3_3qgxgi,Finished another project. This time its Every characters FRoll distance lined up with hurtboxes. Green lines are where a characters hurtbox is starting. Yellow lines are how far the character leans in during the vulnerable frames before roll starts which most characters didnt need Red lines are where the closest hurtbox is on the first frame of vulnerability White lines are where the Roll ends marked by the same hurtbox as Green.tier  tier  tier  I do this in hopes that DT will seriously look at rolls again and decide whether some of the characters in tier  really have an acceptable roll. for example sheik probably has an acceptable roll but thats because her total distance is much greater than others even though her furthest hurtbox isnt that far out.  remember that all rolls have already been standardized by frame data They all start on frame  with  exceptions and they all have invincibility from . all rolls end on . things to really note is that Bowser actually starts reversing momentum after his invincibility ends thus the reason his white line is closer than his red line and  is that if I went by true brawlbox hurtboxs for zard his redline would be before his green line. making him the only character with a couple frames where the roll would have a negative value.all pictures are taken with camera lock. so no characters is artificially inflated due to shifting camera.and I didnt forget luigi this time,SSBPM,cwf2155,13,t5_2u3tn

I know I should be doing it but its scary to lose what you could use for kills recovery and combos.Now I also notice I didnt dash dance as much. I should have done some of that at least.

Boiko one of the best Ness player out there uses different buttons for each of his aerials.The neutral game is hard for Ness and his pk fire is only moderately helpful in that state of the game. Its been said by a lot of players that Ness is a bait and punish kind of character simply because approaching with Ness is mostly unsafe. Learn how to bait with dash dance and to use magnet tricks and djcs to make your movement harder to predict and youll probably see your Ness game get better overall.,SSBPM,cx1ay56,2,t5_2u3tn

5783418,0,t3_3udq2g,gtIs something wrong with my controller when I use the cstick it wont charge up it just throws out the smash. Also whenever I go for a grab with the left trigger sometimes itll just shield. Charging a smash with the Cstick is only in Smash  in Melee and Brawl and PM your Cstick will throw out uncharged smashes. You can charge them by pressing Cstick and pressingholding Attack or Grab at the same time but at that point you might as well just charge a smash with Control Stick  Attack. So grabs are a macro of Shield  Attack where Shield is held and Attack is input for  frame. Since theres no input buffer by default pressing Grab when youre unable to act i.e. in the end lag of a previous move will do Shield  Attack but since you cant do anything yet Shield will continue to be held and the Attack input will come too early to be a grab so when you are finally able to act youre likely still holding down the Grab button through which youre sorta holding Shield. TLDR if youre grabbing but only a shield is coming out youre grabbing too early. gtAlso sometimes after I go in practice mode and go back to playing solo the games camera wont follow the players. I never know how to fix this so I reset the Wii and its all good.By practice do you mean training? Can you go through the specific steps that make this happen?No one really plays online Wii its not a great system and the lag is pretty bad. As for who to play play who you enjoy more. Marth is a good character to start with as he has fluid movement and requires spacing but training with the character you aim to get really good with is the best bet. Discussion and guides can be found here and for Marth you can check out Melee Marth guides since hes nearly identical. ,SSBPM,cxdzl0r,8,t5_2u3tn

Sure you can explain it all away but squirtle really isnt dumb because his movement is telegraphed. Game and Watch is whatever squirtle is whatever the whole cast is whatever. It doesnt really matter whether or not you can justify why a character has a certain trait only that he does or doesnt have it and what the appropriate counterplay is. If people dont want to play a game that has a whole lotta matchups and would rather play a game that has a nearly realized meta and the distinction between players is really just technical aptitude and mental game play melee.

5841809,0,t1_cxld7g6,This is my speculationNintendo didnt do shit before because they had very little to lose. PM was just another mod at the time and they had no  significant financial relation with the smash franchise after brawl died down.Fast forward to smash  and all of a sudden the smash scene becomes a business opportunity. Nintendo was pretty passive aggressive with pm before you cant even say PM without getting banned on their forums which is fucking hilarious for paper mario fans and more or less just tried to ignore it till it went awayWell it didnt go away and Nintendo likely still saw pm as a threat and wanted to kill it by strangling it in a dark alley and now pmdt cant talk about it or legal action money fuck etcThat said even if this is false the fact remains that this is legal pressure one way or another. Pmdt shut this shit down because they are acutely aware that legal action is a real problemAlso if anyone seriously objects to this being about legal issues then please read the post again and consider that their public explanation was about creative decay but they felt the need to remove all the downloads and put THEIR ATTORNEYS EMAIL ON THE POST,SSBPM,cxldz0b,5,t5_2u3tn

Thanks to my friend Makensie for recording Dolphin footageIve been makingmodifying stages for about a year now and I havent uploaded much of anything outside a few . gt . patches. But after the PMDT disbanded I decided Id try and clean up one my projects and finish it.Its a legal skin based off of a preexisting Marble Zone stage hack  for .. Initially I ported the textures and called it quits but now Im revisiting it and trying to make a more accurateunique stage skin. Its a WIP and very empty in the background right now. Ive deleted a lot of the GHZ models and Im currently learning how to create my own models to more accurately represent Marble Zone.Theres no download right now because Id like to get your opinion on how I can make it look nicer. What can I do to make the color palette more appealing? The . version used Marble Garden Zones wall texture for part of the background and I removed it for consistency but now its looking very... purple. Is the platform a visibility issue? I changed the colors to match Marble Zones platforms but Id be willing to sacrifice it if its too hard to look at. Should I scrap the whole damn thing because its garbage?Any constructive criticism would be amazing because its starting to look a little garbage to me and Id like to know how to fix it.

6031848,0,t1_cya5r9p,I also disagree with GampWs FTilt being S. Its not really a kill move and the late hitbox is only thing capable of comboing into anything and even that only lasts for  frames and requires the opponent to literally run into it since it doesnt come out until frame . Ive only ever seen it combo into something onceIts a high frame commitment despite its lingering properties. Every character can run up and shield it then shieldgrab him. You could even roll behind him and grab him when you see him pull it out thats how long it takes for him to execute the move. Its slowness makes it not a good poking tool like most other FTilts are used for.FTilts use comes mostly in the form of panic kill options at incredibly high s on opponents who are constantly approaching through the air if they were on the ground DTilt wouldve been better or to cover bad attempts at sweetspotting the ledge. DTilt covers further below ground level than FTilt does but FTilt lingers and is capable of covering multiple options. In all honesty FTilt is probably his second worst move next to SideB.Bear in mind that by putting it in STier you are putting it on the same level as Shieks FTilt. That doesnt seem right its definitely a BTier move.,SSBPM,cyaajdz,4,t5_2u3tn

6042371,0,t3_3y4yi9,Ok Sand I dont want to pour a whole lot on you so I am just going to comment on one part of your matches that has a bunch of problems.Go to  where you start your last stock vs Fox. You get a dtilt on Fox then you follow up with a fair. There are a multitude of other moves you could have used other than fair to extend your combo ideally either utilt or grab at the percent Fox was at. You are a GnW and he is a spacie dtilt at that percent should equal heavy punish so first thing work on your punish game. GnW excels at juggling opponents and keeping them in the air so only use fair as a combo ender rather than extender.A little bit later you get a grab and uthrow vs Fox this is great but for some reason you tried to follow up with a nair. This is only a good option at high percents vs spacies as a kill option but any other time it is not a great option. vs spacies when I get a grab I like to always go for the regrab if I can you could here because he DId away from platform but if they go onto a platform be ready for a tech chase reaction and try to techchase with whatever you want. Dair uair waveland grab you have plenty of options. Just dont do nair vs spacies at low percent lol.Alright right when you last your last stock look at how Fox grabbed you. GnW has an ultra safe oos option called upb. Use it especially in a situation like this because Fox wasnt even attacking your shield that hard. so practice upb oos as well as other oos options.Alright that may be a lot I covered more objective type stuff but I can certainly get into the mental part of the game if you want me to. But for now i am going to bed. And tell me if you would rather me post future critique on Skype Im not sure if you would see it there so I just posted here to be safe. Any further videos you want critiqued come post in the GnW skype group and we will be happy to help.,SSBPM,cybnx9k,1,t5_2u3tn
6044522,0,t3_3yaqsj,EDIT Im going to try addressing your questions in regards to both of your characters but I might miss some stuff. If you have more specific questions feel free to ask. Zelda has some of the most devastating punishes in the game and she specializes in mitigating linear approaches. From how you described Dins Fire Im assuming that you dont know all of the counter measures for it. When a Din is placed it produces a static hit box that can be shielded and clanked with. If a Dins Fire touches a shield it loses its active hit box so shieldgtWD OoS is a great way to handle grounded traps. With Ivysaur you can disarm a Din with any of your disjointed hitboxes razor leaf even neutral air and jab. Things are a little harder for Ness since his reach is less extensive but you can trigger PK Fire on Dins mines cancel them with all aerials but fair and absorb it with magnet. Breverse psi magnet is a decent way to absorb Dins while keeping you safe just be careful about Zelda conditioning you to disarm traps with magnet. Jumping over Dins may seem like the best option but you might be jumping into one of her powerful normals. Take the time to disarm traps before going in and Zelda will lose many of her DI traps and tech chases. Dins Fire at ledge prevents you from sweet spotting with your double jump but can be dealt with by sweet spotting with your up special. Nesss PK Thunder  plows right through Dins Fire so practice those angles. Ivysaurs recovery can be a little more fickle if Zelda starts mixing things up but her up b should take you straight to the ledge where you will get invulnerability. From there you can either ledge dropgtrising nair to disarm the mine and contest Zelda or ledge jumpgtwave land to just get away from it all together. Finally Zeldas weight. No she does not get out of hit stun faster but since she has such a low weight and fall speed she can escape most combos with good directional influence. While her ability to escape combos is superb her aerial mobility is sub par making her easy to juggle if you are aware of her threat zones. Try knocking her into the air and then approaching as if you want to continue the combo and fade back. You have either have to bait Zelda to whiff an aerial or out space her in the air. Hope that helps.,SSBPM,cyby075,10,t5_2u3tn

6074778,0,t1_cyfv6n5,gtgtI mean for everyone at home not setting up a tournament. Playing with Bowsers as an Alt stage is as simple as pressing L when you play it. Playing with SSZ requires everyone who wants to play with the official ruleset expecting players to not put in a bit of effort to familiarize with the competitive stagelist is a bit of a cop out. theyve already put PM on their setup they can do the extra easy step.gtgtIt takes longer for everyone to get to the platform. my point was that it takes certain characters even more time than others. not everyone has the same vertical acceleration or velocity do not generalise.gtgtId actually be interested to see whether DJ waveland onto nonBowsers platforms is faster than full hop waveland for characters as as you near the apex of the jump the vertical velocity decreases and a DJ will boost that. probably but my point was that if you need to use your DJ its an opportunity cost of having your DJ to mixup.gtgtI dont think that its unbalanced just because you have to double jump to get to the platform. Should we remove all platforms because Jiggs and Kirby always need to use multiple jumps? Isnt it unbalanced for them? Welcome variety.those characters obviously dont suffer the same issues as certain other characters namely ganon bowser peach not sure if this is a serious counterpoint but if it is please elaborate.gtgtId probably argue that WL can be played more defensively because theres more vertical space to waveland around even if the stage is smaller. for certain matchups you could possible argue that. again my point is that this stage polarizes matchups and weighs towards one character far more than it might for any matchup on WL.gtgtMaybe theres potential for it to be played defensively but the platforms are absolutely not comparable to Norfair. Marths Utilt still hits people on them for gosh sakes. im comparing them in terms of the options they facilitate. and that is platform camping in matchups where characters have fast vertical movement against characters with slow vertical movement and weak upwards hitboxes falco vs ganon.gtgtIt actually wasnt created by PMDT. It was made by daiches. doesnt matter who created it. it was validated by the PMDT hence its inclusion by the PMDT on the netplay build.gtgtThe netplay build is not the official build youre reaching there. Its a version of PM . but it isnt the definitive main release of .. Just because you claim that netplay build is official is an objective fact doesnt make it one. good jokegtgt PM is not perfect we need to deal with what we have. bored of addressing your metaargument about whats official and whats considered a part of a mod of a game. youre not going to be convinced otherwise so you dont need to mention it anymore coz i get it. you think that a zalt is for some reason more legitimate in the main build than the zalt for the netplay build released by the same developers.gtgtUnique interactions  imbalanced. The small things people complain about are worth it rounding out the stagelists even attributes. semantics again. if you want me to actually say limiting interactions gameplay disruptive interactions and direct nerfs to characters i will. the small things people complain about is enough reason to include SSZ instead of BC because no characters suffers direct nerfs just for playing on a weird surface.gtgtAlso for including SSZ instead of BC if the attributes are basically Lylat widthside BZtop BZwall.So its like not a replacement at all if thats what youre going for.im not. our stagelist isnt the same as yours so SSZ is not a direct replacement of BC. with the introduction of SSZ into a stagelist you can change around certain other stages to achieve the same widthsidetopwall whatever thing youre going for. its not like those factors are at all relevant anyway when considered in the method of your main post. when you look at a stage you have to consider every element of it as one and then compare that to every other stages elements as one.your method of here are all singular elements of each stage and the same amount of each single element is the same doesnt work quite the same as here are the elements of this stage these certain elements of this stage in certain matchups become irrelevent or outweighed by another element but here is another stage that complements the existence of this stage and every stage has a complement in every matchup with one being considered as neutral as possible.what i mean by that is say in the ness vs fox matchup ness may appreciate dreamland because of its dimensions but the fact that it is a tri platform stage means that fox actually prefers this stage more because he can use the tri platforms to escape in pressured situations and force ness off the ground. the fact that his neutral is buffed more than his ability to kill early actually helps fox kill comparatively quicker than ness because ness has a harder time actually getting punishes on fox.our stagelist isS GHZ DL BF SV PSCP YS FD SSZ DSDP replaces GHZ for doubles.,SSBPM,cyfw1ae,1,t5_2u3tn

6176719,0,t1_cyrnmsb,Your play isnt hyperaggressive youre probably just not playing well to be honest. The first thing everyone wants to do is try to just go ham on your opponent all the time and try to get a cool combo. But that just isnt how this game works. I cant explain the scrubbiness away with a certain process for you youre gonna have to figure it out yourself. Just keep getting frustrated and channel that frustration into finding legitimate counter play like spacing movement and mixups. Dont just try the same approach every single time blindly of what your opponent is doing. This is when you really start getting a grasp on what the neutral is and how incredibly complex it can be.The biggest piece of advice I can give you is watch your opponent more than yourself. This can be hard on a technical character or when youre newer cause you arent as confident but the more you are REACTING to your opponent instead of them reacting to you for example your Ness friend is reacting to your blindly rushing him down and he knows you dont know how to space properly yet so he just shields and punishes you the better. This applies to every aspect of smash edgeguarding recovering combos and especially neutral. Its not just  player fighting a sandbag out there there is counter play to basically everything. Shield grabbing is one of those counter play. Be reactive and dont go in with a set game plan of what you wanna do to your opponent cause  times out of  youre gonna fail if you arent reacting to what they are doing as well.As for your second question those  things arent really that different but yeah thats the gist of it. The goal is to be as far away from your opponents shield and more generally your opponent and still be able to hit them. For example sheiks f tilt is AMAZING like one of the best f tilts in the game. It has a lot range is super fast and low cooldown. So Im like  sure that if you run up to the Ness player or walk cause sheiks walk is pretty amazing IIRC you can f tilt their shield at max distance and they cant shield grab you. F tilt  ridiculously free combos on Ness. Your overall goal with sheik is to lead into her amazing fair and F tilt sets up for this perfectly.,SSBPM,cyrq8xo,3,t5_2u3tn

It can definitely kill off the top at midtohigh percents especially on floaties or on platforms. I dont know if its safe on shield but it pushes people back enough that its hard to punish. Its faster than sh upair covers the front unlike up tilt and is less of a commitment then rest. Its also a DI mixup since you want to DI most of his other kill options bair fsmash dsmash up. I think drillup smash is a thing too. Someone else said something about DACUS with puff but Im not sure how good it is. Its definitely better than marthfalconsonic though. I know its already been moved to C but Nesss up smash is probably D tier. Its super slow super weak kills at like  and is completely useless against most characters only a very situational antiair on spacies. It might be the worst up smash in the game.

So after conditioning your opponent into waiting to stuff your shellshift you can evade and turn just like every other character to confirm into a grab.,SSBPM,czknoui,2,t5_2u3tn
6434124,0,t1_czkt5db,Its definitely easier to notice when youre generally having trouble with tech than when youre generally having trouble with option selection or spacing or something more subtle like that. However after losing an individual interaction you should still sometimes be able to point out what the mistake was. If Im dash dancing around a Zelda trying to bait something out but come in too closely and eat a downsmash I know my spacing was off for instance.Because each character has a different set of tools or at least utilize the common ones to different degrees you should wind up emphasizing different gameplay elements. Id assume that when youre playing Marth youre grabbing more than you would with Lucario and that when youre playing the spacies youre approaching more. It can probably help those aspects of your Lucario even if they arent the biggest parts of your game plan to think about whats going right and wrong when you play the other characters. It definitely wont be easy to transition to this type of thinking but it will definitely improve your Lucario if you do.,SSBPM,czktrho,1,t5_2u3tn

MK can also lead into d smash from nair at certain  and depending on which strongmediumweak part of the nair you hit with. Other characters in A I would say MK would use his d smash to the same frequency besides maybe ICs and luigi.

6706331,0,t1_d0cydvl,Range doesnt do everything. DK has many of the same qualities except he has it even worse because of his size and the lack of projectiles.The reasons Ivy loses the matchup she loses is typically a combination of those factors  No shield. Her shield is super easy to poke and even when it does what you want it to do aka block something the OoS options suck. The quickest one is nair at frame  when everybody else at least has a frame  grab that has more range and more reliable followups. Ivys shieldgrab is frame . And you better believe if the opponent is used to putting shield pressure against people who can react in  frames putting shield pressure against people who can only react in  frames is piss easy. Having no shield really kills this defensive character. Picture this  youre supposed to provoke mistakes and then punishing them but then its much harder to make mistakes against you. Theres a running joke in the Ivy community  we say that roll is our best OoS option  of the time. Not good movement. Something a lot of people fail to realize is that in Smash having good movement does not make you aggressive and flashy. The better your movement the easier it is to stay away. Well Ivy is usually the victim of this because her own movement is severely outmatched by most of the melee top tiers as well as a few of the PM additions. Ivy is one of the many characters who gets dash dance camped. Weakness to SDI. Ivy has a lot of multihit moves and if you understand how to SDI them she suddenly becomes a much worse character. Nair and sideB notably are two moves which go from being completely OP to being usable should the opponent know the matchup. And you know why it sucks being weak to CC ? Because the top tiers are pretty much all fast fallers and those characters spend more time on the ground during combos. Her recovery. Ivys recovery is kind of really fucking polarizing. Pretty much everyone can edgehog her you basically just need to time your edgehog to avoid an extremely telegraphed razor leaf  of the time but the reward you get for doing so varies between a single hit Mario Bowser ... to a guaranteed stock loss Roy Captain Falcon Marth ...,SSBPM,d0czqmy,2,t5_2u3tn

This repeats until I get to the top level pretty much.Also the thing about friends playing with friends only is alright but its much more fun when youve learned things from playing others and then applying it against your friends.,SSBPM,d0rb5y7,1,t5_2u3tn

6863118,0,t3_49p7we,As for Roy I played him nonstop in Melee as a kid. My brother would pick Marth and over the course of about  years our own little person meta was kind of a rock paper scissors between any attack grab and jumping and countering at the other person. Sometimes he would do something actually cool because he was  years older than me and I would immediately let loose the kind of salt only an yearold can unleash.When I picked him up in PM after actually getting good at smash through other games I instinctively dtilted a lot without remembering why. Then I started watching Sethlons play Bonus points for him using the same colour I always have and now Roys firmly my main.I use Marth sometimes because his moveset is familiar to Roys and I mained him in Brawl.I also main Luigi because when I was playing around with each character I heard Luigi had a good wavedash so I tried it and WHOOOOAAAA SO WACKY. I originally started using him to practice using wavedash in battle and not just messing around when my opponent is respawning but I accidentally got decent. I really dont like his Brawl voice though I want YAYA. Too bad Melee gives him a shit fair and tap jump.,SSBPM,d0u8t7j,2,t5_2u3tn

6873827,0,t3_49uzfi,I think different characters movesets prevent this from being a good idea.So I could use Lucario to practice shield pressure but Lucario has completely different options out of his DD than Marth so I develop bad habits like thinking Dash Attack is safe on shield.,SSBPM,d0vglw0,1,t5_2u3tn

6920849,0,t3_4aixsk,Mk Vs Neon  LTC was the rabbit hole for me. I didnt play smash at all until my friend showed me that game. My first professional Smash Brothers game I ever watched. It blew my mind. It opened my eyes to an entire world that I never knew existed. I was hooked. I brought a controller the same day.The next game I saw was Rolex Vs Professor Pro. The commentary was amazing The mid set pop offs were hilarious and in the strangest way I felt connected to these people on the other side of the world playing a game I had only just been introduced to. Those two sets started it all for me. I know alot of other people have their own idea of the most important set but to me and so many others in my region these sets started it all for us. PM revived our scene. We went from  players to  entrants an event. Thats massive for one of the most isolated places in the world. One of our players even bested Armada in a v at his height of .

Another  MU if yoshi can cheese samus out of her recovery and tether with down tilt then this MU isnt that bad along with a strong projectile game like aiming your eggs above or in front of samus to approach better.

Thats what I was responding to.Regarding Jiggs do you think Falcon beats Jiggs in Melee? And if not why do you think he beats her in PM?I dont think Falcon beats Mario at all. This is one of those rare MUs where Falcon does not seem to clearly have the edge in punish game. Keep in mind that a lot of normal Falcon combos do not work on Mario. Hes just at a weird weight. Dthrowuthrow knee is not a guaranteed KO like it often is so if you wanna get an efficient kill you either need to land a stomp somehow or get a random knee in neutral. And how is the neutral? Of course fireballpills are a tool you can deal with in neutral but I think they swing the MU slightly in Marios favor.

7300027,0,t1_d27kt0n, The counterpick system is a separate issue and should be resolved separately. Besides the ideal is RR. The ideal system cares about Game Count because it is more indicative of overall skill and because it is closer to the base game. Having that compound with the counterpick system is closer to the ideal than using a system that avoids it. As I mentioned it is an unfortunate consequence of the base game that we have to reset the game each time we want to implement the counterpick system. However since the game only cares about individual games and not stocks we have no reasonable way of valuing an individual stock. But we do have a concrete way of valuing an individual game. Smashers SHOULD have to be concerned with Game Count. As I said it is closer to BOTH ideals. It is Double Elimination that is the odd format not the standard. Double Elimination only exists because it is the best combination of practicality and competitiveness when practicality is an issue. HH doesnt tell you nearly as much about a players overall skill level as their overall Game Count.,SSBPM,d27yozb,1,t5_2u3tn

7333167,0,t3_4fta20,Ikes Fsmash is pretty slow but it has some pretty good range. I think it hits behind him too for a little bit. If you can react to it you can run up to it and shield. After he hits you you can punish. You can also quickdraw attack as a fast way of hitting him out of an fsmash.Also I dont think aerials can clank so I wouldnt try to punish an already started fsmash with and aerial. One last thing is that if you dashdance a bit you can bait out the fsmash. Then you can just wait until hes finished to punish.,SSBPM,d2bqbh4,2,t5_2u3tn

7467700,0,t1_d2qx2bc,How do you punish it on a platform though? Sonic is like Snake you arent playing Smash against him. If youre on a platform his only option is to aerial. You can turn your back and drop through or sh nairbair and time him out. Or shield drop nairdairbair. Sonic  doesnt have an answer to this. I think MK mains are trying to fight Sonic toe to toe when its impossible for Sonic to cope with MK playing lame. Edit Think of it this way Peach vs. ICs is considered unwinnable and one of the worst MUs in the game. Peach vs. ICs isnt actually that bad BUT ICs have zero answer to float cancelfair. Peach can actually just spam float cancel fair above ICs and autowin because the move just beats the character. MK can do this BUT EASIER. Its so much easier to sit on a platform and reactively use an aerial or drop through aerial or shield drop aerial.

My friend has played Falcon for years probably since before PM was developed. But even if there is the possibility of variation in his playstylecombos I never see any of it.

Very back  sends straight upwards. No it makes no fucking sense. Yes its mandatory.Uair actually makes complete sense once you know its frame data! Heres a gif of Pikachus Uair from melee since I cant find a PM Version and heres its PM Frame DataFirst Hit Damage  BKB  KBG  Direction Second Hit Damage  BKB  KBG  Direction Third Hit Damage  BKB  KBG  Direction Hitbox   Total So the first hitbox that comes out from frames  sends the opponent nearly straight up at an  angle. This is the hitbox right behind Pikachu and is pretty self explanatory when you mess around with it. Its the other two hitboxes that generally confuse people.The second hitbox is the semispike hitbox from frames . Its active right above and behind Pikachu and then right above Pikachu. Like Captain Falcons Knee though you can get a reverse hit depending on Pikachus positioning during the hit. This is why you often get the backwards spike on the hitbox above and slightly behind Pikachu.And finally the third hitbox from frames  send the opponent backwards over Pikachus head. If youre going for the spike and get this hitbox youre spacing it wrong or doing the Uair too early! I have seen this hitbox get reverse hits on the rare occasion as well though its much harder to do.Hope this clears up any confusion on how Pikachus Up air works D,SSBPM,d34i9c8,6,t5_2u3tn

The directional inputs here are both input after the upB starts which is different from a standard wavebounce. Inputs also seen in the gfy. input upB. immediately slide the control stick backwards. immediately slide the control stick in the direction Roy is facing.upon further testing a more consistent method is just executing the upB then rotating the control stick around in the direction opposite to which way Roy is facing. Ex  if Roy is facing right upB and rotate the stick counterclockwise until it gets back to facing left and vice versa.

However along with balance stage lists are intended to foster fun gameplay and entertainment. Camping and runaway strategies are rarely fun for players or the audience. The effect is compounded by the fact that character survivability on DL makes the game last so long. If camping and runaway gameplay become the meta Project M may lose a substantial portion of both its player base and audience.   I am not a professional player.

Simply Google Super Smash Bros.

8026504,0,t1_d4i8f1y,Im not sure why everyone thinks cape is so amazing the end all be all to all of Ganons woes. How often do you see any of the other reflectors in this game or Smash in general being used to actually deal with projectiles? You very seldom do because they all lock you down for quite a bit of time. This is why powershielding or hitting through them is almost always better since it allows you to move forwards while dealing with the projectile. ROBs sideB is the only exception that springs to mind as it also allows for him to move forwards while reflecting. Ganon can be punished for successfully reflecting a projectile. So the end result of this is that missiles still give Ganon a hard time. While its true that Ganon can kill Samus earlier than almost anyone removing one of her advantages against most of the cast that alone is not enough to sway the matchup. If he had that in conjunction with the ability to deal with Samus other strengths it would certainly be in his favour but his actual ability to deal with those other tools is iffy at best. Also crawl. Crawl is fucking incredible. I dont think Ganon has an answer to that. ,SSBPM,d4i95zm,2,t5_2u3tn

8043004,0,t3_4pdh97,Id say what killed him in addition to not punishing too well were autopiloting and falling for some ivy things many times. The  critical things I think were the following.Bad lasers. Laser should be used as a tool to lock the opponent down at the midrange and force shield options or options to counteract the pressure. These include things like jumping over the lasers nairing through them powershielding or retreating just anything that can give me a break from those. Darkwolf did not scout any of these options as far as I can tell and just opted to immediately nair if he was close enough or to close in with another laser. Nairing at the correct spacing isnt bad at all as the timing for ivy to move herself out of the way is pretty tight and I only managed the wavedash back out of it once that set. However moving in with another laser is usually very bad to autopilot because most characters can choose moves like my nair that beat the laser and hit wolf out of his jump or otherwise my jumping over the laser also got wolf punished. Laser should not be used as an approach tool but as a locking tool to help scout approaches. Laser to dash dance is really strong darkwolf should use it more. Falling to ivys nairjabs pressure string. Ivys nair has a landing hitbox making it  on shield cant remember. Ivys jab comes out on frame  so if Im tight enough with the timing it is impossible to shield grab between the nair and the jab. To beat the pressure simply hold shield until you think an OoS option will work after jab  or between jab  and jab . Ivysaur can also loop jab  in a similar way to samus for shield pressure and its also similarly fast. Basically he should have picked up on this instead of trying to shield grab me automatically after nair something like  times during the set. Literally never grabbing. Darkwolf needs to pick up on his grab game and being able to get grabs without shield grabbing. Instead of nairshine nair grab works pretty well and backthrow is very strong against ivysaur. Bthrow chaingrabs can work on bad DI and on DI in you can extend combos with options like shine dair at mid percents nair to drag me back down at low percents and fair to kill at high percents. Bthrow to fair works well on floaties so darkwolf should learn to find and get that conversion. TDLR darkwolf autopiloted and let me get away with a looot of stuff and he also never grabbed me. ,SSBPM,d4k3yb2,9,t5_2u3tn

In PM due to AGTbeing able to catch projectiles with an air dodge it gets even harder for her as her turnips can be turned around on her especially with Links good item toss frame data.Link has a hard time getting grabs due to float and if Peach gets in she can put a lot of pressure on Link which he has a hard time dealing with. ,SSBPM,d51spvo,2,t5_2u3tn

8207786,0,t3_4rrfbp,EDIT There are nice nonvideo guides available. Edited this post for clarity. Project M . the final version is available as both homebrew and hackless. For Dolphin youll just need to use both Project M and Gecko OS for the smoothest experience. Anyways... If the Project M site itself doesnt work try Project Mirror. The mod itself Project M goes on a virtual sd card size GB which is placed in Dolphin EmulatorWii. Youll need your own Brawl disk image aka iso file to boot in Dolphin it can be ripped from a preexisting Brawl disk that you own yourself also of course we dont condone illegal downloading of Brawl isos which is completely possible. You can make a virtual SD card called SD.raw with a simple program Dolphin SD Card Maker not sure where to find it try Google maybe?. Then put Project M and Gecko OS on the card by mounting it as removable media with WinImage or similar program. Once Project M and Gecko OS are on your virtual SD card again thats likely called sd.raw youll unmount it and place it in the Wii folder. Then boot up Brawl in Dolphin go to the Custom Stage Maker within the game and BOOM! Youre playing Project M. Make sure you dont have any custom stages not even the default ones! before doing this you can delete them within the game of course. Also ensure Insert SD Card is checked within Dolphins configuration. Again there are a few nice guides for this whole process which can be found on Google. Sorry for the big wall of text! Let me know if this violates any rules or if you get stuck. Remember that downloading ISO files of Nintendo games is not condoned and may be illegal in your area. ,SSBPM,d53j0ms,1,t5_2u3tn

8929206,0,t3_52l4bh,One big factor is character drafting in League. You have to have whatsit like  characters just to avoid not getting banned out and then on top of that you have to hope your fourth character doesnt get picked by the other team first so its actually like  characters possibly more if one of them is a character that might get picked up in another role than yours. Theres also no guarantee that your fifth character will be one useful to your intended team comp when you get to toplevel team play though solo queue might be a little different in that regard.Also Leagues fundamentals transfer incredibly strongly across every other champion played in the same role. Last hitting is very similar for every champion who last hits you only have to account for different amounts of damage dealt championtochampion interactions maybe one or two other things Im missingbut knowing not to push too hard unless the enemy jungler is on the other side of the map is always going to apply. Warding is always going to apply. Not diving the tower without a solid plan is always going to apply. Getting minions to block skillshots for you is always going to apply. Mana management is going to apply to every mana champ energy management applies to every energy champ. Junglers only have so many routes to gank. Knowing how many objectives you can take after a teamfight thats also a universal skill.Contrast champions to fighters. A League champion has an autoattack four abilities unique to the champion a few get extras through design shenanigans like Lee but its four buttons two summoner spells which are universal and one of which is Flash which literally everyone takes and possibly some item actives which are optin. You only move through the use of those actives or by walking. Fighters depending on which ones youre talking about have walking dashing running crouching blocking or shielding jumping double jumping airdashing wavedashing teleporting the list goes on and on and on. They also have dozens of moves each with their own highly specific niches and situational uses. Most fighters require some level of technical grinding as well so you can get your characters combos down. None of that transfers directly fighting game fundamentals are applied differently to every character. In a fighter a seemingly simple change like say a nerf to Foxs shine so it loses to CC can have dramatic consequences now Fox has to laser and grab more versus characters with good CC options which changes their good options versus Fox to ones that better combat laser and grabs which means Fox has to space around those options more which creates completely different situations. Meanwhile if you nerf the range on say Twitchs Expunge Twitch still does pretty much the same thing he always does but hes a little less scary while doing it. Itll still have some of the samestyled ripple effects that the shine nerf would have now its safer to dive Twitch because you dont have to be as far from him to get out of danger Twitch has to extend more to get a big Expunge off maybe Twitch becomes less popular so his counters become less popular which means other characters become more popular etc. but that still doesnt really change whether its better to go for Baron or inhibitors after a perfect  teamfight.  If your League fundamentals are good character balance changes arent really going to affect you all that much because many decisions have little to do with your character choice.Im not knocking League when I say this but tldr when youre looking only at v play fighting games blow MOBAs out of the water in terms of complexity and depth which encourages sticking to only one characteryoull only ever need one and theyre harder to learn anyway. Those simply arent the skills MOBAs test they test team strategy instead.,SSBPM,d7l5qbc,2,t5_2u3tn

8944296,0,t3_52rzmw,Hey Im Byrd former competitor and TO from AZ speaking solely my own opinion here.As most here I would love a patched version of the game. Honestly Id be really hard pressed to find someone whod be against quality of life changes and other bug fixes and even minor rebalancing on the cast. The truth of the matter is PM feels like an unfinished game since it well is an unfinished game.The point here isnt that though. Its about the PM community at large. And in that regard it would in my humble opinion be incredibly detrimental to the community to adopt a new patch. Really the most important factor to consider from my position should be cohesion. The PM community is anything BUT on the same page. We have differing opinions in regards to ruleset stagelist bans and even counterpicking. Is it really wise to throw a new version in the mix? In order to standardise this patch it would take a massive coalition of TOs a sort of organisation that is simply not existent at the moment. Without it you would have a schism between the community one that seems to be pretty  or . At that point which becomes the real Project M? Allowing for this patch will very likely fracture the community even further and would be in my opinion a lot more damaging to the future of the game than the current balanceglitch issues.As much as it would be awesome to have these issues fixed the big picture damage that would likely ensure from it should not be neglected and as such Id be far more willing to maintain the status quo. ,SSBPM,d7mz0wu,23,t5_2u3tn

9232845,0,t1_d8m9kou,Exactly. Peach has a much longer lasting float on top of her double jump. This significantly strengthens her recovery both in distance and mixup potential. I believe both Peach and Mewtwo can float cancel aerials correct? I think Mewtwos float has more potential in combos because of his nair and its ability to lead into grab. Also uair can combo into itself and has very little endlag. Meanwhile all of Peachs aerials except dair and reverse hit bair are used defensively to hit opponents away. The only way these moves can combo is if uair juggles usually only a couple hits or so or bairfair lead into a techchase.So while both floats have definite advantages Mewtwos compliments his punish game while Peachs complements her defensive options.,SSBPM,d8mbx01,4,t5_2u3tn

A move like Luigis SideB doesnt start moving until frame  so if theres still enough knockback affecting you to take you beyond the blastzone before the burst movement can counteract it youll die.A lot of moves have a great deal of startup before movement begins and that movement still has to be strong enough to bring you a net distance forward compared to the knockback still affecting you as you come out of hitstun. You can still appear to go backwards even after movement starts due to this.Double jumps are capable of pushing you forward as soon as they are started however. Using them right after hitstun ends to jump forward can sometimes provide enough forward movement to counteract whatever latent knockback still remains. This can occasionally save your life when using a special move would not.On the contrary there are some moves that halt knockback altogether on the first frame. Examples of such moves would be Kirbys DownB and GampWs DownB Many GampWs have learned to spam DownB as they approach the blastzone because it allows them to survive in that situation when most other characters would die since they have no means of counteracting the knockback quickly enough. A few other characters have moves capable of cancelling knockback without actually moving anywhere although not as quickly as Kirby or GampW can do it. These moves are ROBs UpB Capt. Falcons UpB Olimars NeutralB and Sonics DownB or SideB and they can still die if they enter the blastzone before their move can cancel the knockback. This will never happen to GampW or Kirby however since knockback stops immediately.,SSBPM,d9xwgst,7,t5_2u3tn

But it does convey the basic thrust of what OP needs to do look at specific errors and then try to address them specifically rather than getting bogged down in a general feeling of inadequacy. This can be hard advice to put into practice for some people for others it seems to come naturally but lets take a look at the OPs reaction to this advicegt told you im stupid lolThats...not great.

10875929,0,t3_5vfxxc,Plat Cancelled UairMost people probably know this but you can cancel certain aerials while rising through platforms if you time them properly due to ECB contortions. Mario Up Air is one of them and since i never see anybody use this to their advantage I figured Id show off some uses I like.Most are pretty simple. clip  just demos the cancel which can totally just be used for flashy movement.  is using it confirm into grab pretty sure this will work on shield as well.  is using it to tech chase which is one I more commonly use in matches.  is some wild edge cancel mixups with it to put out lots of hitboxes quickly. Number  is all three types of uair cancels Ive posted about in one combo. The first is this one the second is a drop cancel The third is a Pseudo drop cancel If you can somehow fit an edge cancel in their props. These are just a few uses but Mario can pretty much do whatever he wants so theres bound to be more potential here. What other lit shit can this be used for with Mario or other characters for movement or combos?,SSBPM,de1rwbb,7,t5_2u3tn
10876792,0,t1_de1ur4p,Yeah but its slower and personally I find it harder you have to wait for the platform dropping animation for a couple frames or else you end up doing a smash on accident. I think its just easier to shield drop and throw out an aerial at the same time makes it way harder to do nairs though,SSBPM,de1v3oe,6,t5_2u3tn

10966750,0,t1_deb3va0,RAR bair dacus boost grab.Basically a huge part of what makes her bad in melee is her lack of credible ranged threats while grounded and the fact that she needs to get a hard read to kill floaties at any kind of reasonable .Shes still bad and has plenty of bad MUs  but shes much better than shes given credit for. A large part of what gives her problems in PM is the fact that she needs a lot of matchup knowledge of pretty much the entire cast in order to function properly. Once thats achieved though its not that awful.,SSBPM,deb55np,4,t5_2u3tn
