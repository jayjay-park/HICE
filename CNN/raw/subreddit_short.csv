76586,0,t1_cen4bqx,Dont really know but even with that theres variance in terms of symptoms.  Some people have it and look normal.  I on the other hand look like your stereotypical nerd coke bottle glasses and all but not clothing.  Unfortunately Im not a candidate for laser correction and cant really see with contacts.  I also cant really gain muscle.  Tall amp lanky.Disadvantages are not just in the dating world but even in the job market and other areas.  It opens up your eyes early in life that people are fairly hypocritical and extremely shallow.  And Im not talking about socially accepted nerd either that seems to have cropped up over the past decade or so.  Theres a quote from the Simpsons when Moe is auditioning for a movie.  I wanted Mary Ann on Gilligans Island ugly not Cornelius on The Planet if Apes ugly. TV ugly not... ugly ugly.  The same holds true here.To paraphrase one post below from GeoffreyArnold we as a society have attributed negative connotations to certain appearances.  A shorter stature happens to be one but its not the only one with negative connotations.And yes its possible to overcome certain obstacles if you can offset them.  When you bring up Nicolai Valuev he has many traits which can perhaps counterbalance his face such as body wealth vocation etc.  Other people arent so lucky.Its like even in terms of a job my physical appearance makes people think Im not capable of certain things which thus puts me in a lower status job which makes it harder to prove myself and get ahead.  The Lets give that nerd the stuff nobody wants to do.  Oh he must like doing that stuff. Etc..And its difficult to break out of a cycle of negativity.  There are always the posts of Just change your attitude.  Some people mean well but are nave imho as they dont really have any point of reference in their own lives to comprehend the negativity.  Others just dont want to hear anything that disagrees with their world view.  Its hard to break years of resentment.  I guess the best way to describe it would be like having someone trying to change their dominant hand for every days tasks as an adult.  Sure it can be done but its not easy and theres always a chance it might never feel natural and its very easy to slip back to using your original dominant hand to write.,short,cen5c03,3,t5_2sgvi

I guess it seemed to me that he was also talking about all of the ways that women in general had abandoned short men even though he didnt mention dating.And the first thing I thought of that would counter that kind of statement had to do with dating. IIRC short girltaller guy pictures receive a hefty amount of negativity because they go along with the stereotype even if the guy in them is legitimately short. Maybe I am not remembering this right either though.gtDiscussing the role men play in the body image of women is not blaming men the reverse should hold true as well. That is an excellent point and one I will certainly take to heart. I guess its just difficult to realize sometimes when youre repeatedly told that you couldnt possibly understand a short mans dating woes because you are a woman. Or how you have to include an extra sentence about how you realize that life is difficult for short men every time you post something positive about your own life as a short woman lest you be barraged by statements of yeah well of course you feel positively because you are a short women and everyone just things youre so cute and adorable.,short,ceo2bwk,4,t5_2sgvi

Short men are often used for comedic purposes as a counterexample for masculinity and are generally viewed as negative. Because of this no one seems to care about our problems.Seriously I never saw anyone stand up for the short guy. Never.

One of the most attractive men I ever dating was a  kick boxer that was back in the days when basically nobody really knew what it was. I remember him because I was in a bar with a male cousin he walked up to him cousin is tall  and offered a handshake and said  Hi my name is X I really hope this dude is not your boyfriend because I would like to buy you a drink and talk .

134178,0,t1_ceoddz7,Sure! Its a little complicated to describe and understand without seeing it in person but Ill try my best. Basically each team has five players on the track at once that is if no one has a penalty. Four from each team are blockers and one is a jammer. So you have nine blockers and two jammers. Jammers are the ones who score points. They score a point for every opposing skater they pass legally her hips passes their hips. Blockers work to get their jammer through the pack which is everyone together while at the same time keep the other one behind. It gets more complicated than that but this is the gist of it.Heres a picture of the two best teams in the world USA and Canada playing against each other in our world cup in . You can see that it is indeed serious business. My home team coach is the Canadian thats standing up straight.Ireland leagues are from what Ive seen not as developed as America Canada and England.

I would think  would be okay.. but a  guy standing next to a  girl might look strange.. although my neighbor is dating a basketball player at my universty.. and hes like  shes no taller than . It looks fucked up but some guys would do it.What the men of this subreddit talk about are being the minority of the population... which is males below like  I would say...where they know it looks fucked up to date a girl taller than them but it isnt what the average case is.What im saying is that EVEN for the average case.. a ton of girls have a cutoff at ... even girls as short as .. ive seen it.The difference is that for males its about how they look next to their partner.. the height difference between their partner and them is whats important.. and for several females its about how their partner looks in relation to other males... a  guy is slightly short and there are TONS of  guys.. This all boils down to the fact that girls are the choosers.. they can choose a guy who is tall or who is short.. most men are pursuers and if it doesnt work out they move on to the next girl. thats why it makes more sense for females to have more of a preference than males and height is the  preference females have and why heightism is a huge issue in dating for males,short,cgyeufv,-1,t5_2sgvi

961832,0,t3_254btn,gtWhy is choosing not to date ugly people different than not dating short men?Youll have to place short men and ugly womenpeople side by side to get a better answer. First of all there are ugly short men so that is a different story. These short men as seen they have said here many times before claim to be lucky if they get any attention from women.Now to the core of the matter. Some short guys have one minor physical flaw and that is height. Everything else is going for them nice body nice fit good personality healthy good mind education some money. These attractive short guys seem themselves as attractive in the mirror so they rate themselves highly enough that they seek women that are equally attractive to them in their minds. They are not going to rule themselves out for being short and go for fat women or women that are unattractive in face and body.A man as attractive as say Dave Franco will be confident in his looks to seek out attractive women. He wont want to seek out unattractive women unless that is his thing. Furthermore that would be unfair for the short guy. The man is still attractive and now the unattractive or fat women is going to reap the rewards by having an attractive short guy in her possession. He knows that so their will be no way a short guy will let an unattractive woman take advantage of some societal discount status.The way I see it I take good care of my looks by taking care of my body and face but I cant take care of my height so I want to be rated by my looks not my height. I assume short men want to be rated in the same fashion.  Height is a plus when I rate my own image but my over looks are more important to me but to have a woman proclaim how my height is so attractive is very bothering to me. An ugly fat or skinny tall guy will take solace in this and deem himself master race because of this. I wont. I have other things going for me despite my height.Imagine footballer Cristiano Ronaldo at  is told by women wow youre so tall! as being his the reason for his attractiveness or if women were asked to name what is the most attractive feature in Ronaldo and they bark out his height. That man will get fat in an instant from depression. Men are more than just height.,short,chdmb10,0,t5_2sgvi

964811,0,t1_chdrt52,I guess I am the only one around here that sees just someone using descriptives of short and tall to describe someone not necessarily disclosing a personal philosophy or hate filled ideology. You dont know nor does OP know the context of this conversation because all he heard was this dude being described as short at the end of a conversation and that he shouldnt be marrying this other womans daughter I am assuming. Talk about jumping the gun. This unfit husband material could be an alcoholic jerk and just plain not good enough for OPs moms friends daughter. Talk about a gossip train. What it sounded like to me was that OPs mom was listening to her friend rant about some jerk her daughter was shacking up with like mom friends are want to do. I dont know how many times yall have listened to a friend bitch about someone but typically you dont use sympathizing tones that contradict your friends feelings toward a person you may or may not know personally. When youre talking about someone you dont like or wish to portray in a negative light every word out of your mouth will be cast in a sneer and saturated with scorn. It is also very common psychological warfare we do on ourselves to refrain from using a persons name in an attempt to dehumanize them by describing them in parts and calling them names as oppose to using their given name. That short motherfucker that jerk. What it sounded like to me was OPs mom doesnt really know these people being described either and how many people here struggle with remembering peoples names? It is fairly common to use descriptive adjectives to identify a specific person whoms name you dont necessarily remember. I mean I know we all worship short people here but seriously short dudes can be jerks too and never will be good enough for someones little girl because no one ever will. Which hey may have saved this automatically assumed awesome stranger a headache in not getting some crazy motherinlaw. I for one can talk about someone being a total asshole based on points of their character and personal interactions and still describe them as short because they are! and not be some discriminating heightist because I dont remember their god damn name because they are not even important enough to bother with. But yah if it bothered OP that much he should grow some balls and talk to his mother about it like a grown ass man than rant online like a petulant and non understanding child. And then Ill bet you a dollar feel foolish when he realizes hes being rabidly paranoid. He doesnt even have to be confrontational about it. He can ask his mom who she was talking to and who was the jerk and is the girl cute.

Thats not rejection thats just family members being protective of their own.  Some families are more protective than others.  If older brothers are involved thats much more likely to occur.When my sister ended up with a new boyfriend that guy was NEVER good enough for her in my mind.    Wasnt height or anything else like that.  It did make for some interesting situations between me and them though mainly one boyfriend....long story.    It was usually not anything specific about them it was that they were dating MY sister and she deserved the best!  That meant anyone without Teslas intelligence that treated her like a queen and had Bill Gates fortune wasnt good enough in my opinion severely overprotective brother here.

Ive gotten over my YOU ARENT GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY SISTER SO PISS OFF thing and hes part of the family now.   Hes a pretty good guy actually.   Seriously dont sweat it if the family doesnt immediately accept you.   Thats normal!   Especially if shes got over protective brothers P   They might have a strong dislike for you for the first year or more of the relationship even if they dont admit it because you are dating their sister.

1733798,0,t1_cjxir9r,settledownmeow is mostly right.  I dont like to spend a lot of time talking about dating because I agree with you that people have the right to reject anyone for any reason.  But there is no female parallel for height when it comes to dating in our society.  There are plenty of men who willingly date fat women.  Yes many women are selfconscious about their weight but men still want to date them.  And yet there are plenty of short men who are comfortable with their height but that doesnt increase their odds with women.  So there was one fairly recent study showing that  of women openly said that they would never even consider dating a man who was shorter than them.  The height of an average woman with shoes in the U.S. is about  or  barefoot.  So for most men this isnt a huge problem.  But what if youre a man at ?  What if youre ?  Just based on widespread social bigotry and negative attitudes about short men your prospects are very slim based on something of which you have no control.  Building selfesteem has no affect on your chances.  Its pure math based on a widespread and celebrated social bigotry.  Its unhelpful to say be comfortable with yourself because the short men being rejected left and right have done nothing wrong.  They arent entitled to love or affection or even basic human respect....but they shouldnt be blamed for being despised for something they have no control over.  ,short,cjxpk2q,12,t5_2sgvi

1735637,0,t1_cjxwymv,Agreed on all points.   I do get the impression that some people here have other issues that are playing a much bigger factor in their foreveralone status than height.    Weve seen some recent examples of that.   Unfortunately those types of examples stick out in peoples minds and then it reflects negatively on all the guys of rshort making it easy to dismiss dating struggles that are in fact caused by height as the person just being one of those guys who demands perfection and has attitude issues.Height definitely does come into play though and it becomes incredibly evident once you start falling below the average height for women.   That said as a guy who is shorter than  of women I know there are women out there who wouldnt see my height as an immediate deal breaker but it seems like Im trying to find a golden needle of awesomeness in a haystack. The height reason has been used more often than not as a reason for rejection.  Sometimes its used very bluntly by people who otherwise seemed like a great person to know.     Could give many examples but dont really want to right now.It is what it is...    I think a lot of the frustration fueled rants could be done in a much more mature fashion over here but we also have to remember many of these guys are probably in the  range.     I didnt handle adversity very well in that age range either Im sure.     Once you get in your s it sucks just as much to have your height be an instant dealbreaker but you can deal with it a little better at least on the outside P,short,cjxxwin,1,t5_2sgvi

1859445,0,t3_2fvvy6,We knew this would happen. There are psychological reasons why people tend to believe the Napoleon Complex myth. Basically people tend to notice and remember instances when a person performs an action which confirms to a cultural stereotype. Its called confirmation bias .  So there is a cultural stereotype that short men are mean aggressive and angry.  Because of this your brain is going to ignore all of the mean aggressive and angry tall men you come across during the day. But when you happen to come across a short guy who is angry at a particular moment  ah ha!  Its always the short ones!  Little man complex strikes again. The origins of the myth probably stems from the idea that tall is associated with masculinity and therefore tallness is associated with the legitimate exercise of power. Ergo an exercise of power coming from a short male body as read as illegitimate because it lacks masculine authority. And so when we see a short man succeeding or being aggressive or being violent or being proud as in boisterous it offends our collective senses and challenges our notions of what masculinity is supposed to mean the legitimate ability to project dominance over others through threat of violence. And so we despise short men who behave as tall man. Thus the Napoleon complex myth was born. ,short,ckd9anx,18,t5_2sgvi

2430303,0,t3_2nbcme,gtIt seems to me that this is the essence of heightism.All of your observations are perfectly valid.  But I dont think the natural correlation between height and age is the essence of heightism.  I still think that the essence of heightism is gender norms.  So its not so much that short people subconsciously remind us of children.  Its that men are supposed to be tall and women are supposed to be short.  That is the only thing which explains why short women are generally embraced by society while short men are maligned.  To the extent that short men and women face the same prejudices I agree that it is connected to the latent idea that shortness is associated with being childlike.  But the gender discrimination aspect to heightism is extremely disempowering.  I think that the gender norms explanation also explains why women in Western society are so strongly opposed to partnering with shorter men.  Short men are demasculized in our culture.  And because of this short men lose the legitimate social right to exercise dominance over others which is given to other men automatically.  And that ability to exercise dominance is what is attractive to women.  Notice that when nonshort men and especially tall men behave in ways which are designed to exercise dominance over others it is perceived as valid and rewarded by others.  But when short man behave in ways which are designed to exercise dominance over others it is perceived as invalid or inauthentic and punished by others.  Thus the concept of the Napoleon Complex was born.  And what makes it worse is that short boys are then indoctrinated to behave in ways that are less masculine than other boys.  Which only makes things worse for them.  And thus Garmin behavior was born.  ,short,cmc3c7t,11,t5_2sgvi
2448396,0,t1_cmdsprr,Thats bit of a topic switch but Ill hang along. First and foremost I find the complains in articles a bit ridiculous. I am completely against normalization of fat body type like that speaker in the video as it is unhealthy and nothing companies should be promoting. Thats something the first article briefly touches but quickly disregards with a snarky comment.. Well done there totally convinced me.I also dont find the whole Ursula thing too controversial remakes gender bending and age changes are common so why not body changes. Although personally I would find it more interesting if they kept her original curves. There is lack of diversity in the Disney heroines Ill agree there. But I dont see that as a problem either. As Ive said its about ideals and theres nothing ideal in overweight nor is it something we should be promoting. Its also good to keep in mind that were talking cartoons here in the cartoony style everything is a bit exaggerated. So normal becomes a bit slimmer chubby becomes somewhat obese and so on. Although I would agree that itd be interesting to see normal body type on both princes and princesses I am not sure how entertaining that would be or how well it would fit into the style.

2521939,0,t3_2ojll7,In my experience not all short people are considered cute but all attractive short people are. Sometimes its cute alongside other adjectives like hotsexywhatever and other times its just cute in the childish or kittenish way not always mutually exclusive but youll be labeled cute either way.Like if you took a fully grown lion and asked people to describe it thered be a ton of different words used like majestic but I doubt cute would be one of them. Shrink the lion and youd get the reverse. Same goes for people. Take some super hot supermodel goddess or whatever someone like Giselle Bundchen do the same thing and youd get similar results. Take a traditionally tall and handsome man someone like Tom Brady do the same thing and the difference would probably be even more pronounced because being cute is generally considered to be more of a feminine quality and men are far more removed from femininity than women are from masculinity in our culture.None of this is to say there arent a lot of people out there that love being seen as cute but its not always advantageous and my point is that as a short person youre only real choice is to either look like a troll or be considered cute.

There was a thread here yesterday which linked to a raskmen thread where OP was much like this OP. He asked what other men thought when they saw a short man and he clearly assume that no one would care. He was wrong. Top comment was I think his life must suck.  So its not something that exists in your head. But its like anything else. You shouldnt let it ruin your life. Racism is a real thing too.

2735128,0,t3_2rai5c,Hello there! Hope youre feeling good. I struggled through the same thing as a kid but more because I was painfully shy than anything else. The family moved around a couple of times which made me socially cutoff from neighbors to play with.Anyway I overcame it by doing all the little things day by day. In college and then the workplace I worked up the courage to say something to a friend. I remember the first time I complimented a girl for her attire in my mind it took eons to gather up the words but I did and I felt so accomplished! The firsts are always the hardest but it comes easy after that.I even went through the whole talking to strangers thing on the bus and train some worked and some failed but I figured that they were too awkward and random to continue doing. I mean how do you even tell if that person is gonna have the same wavelength as yours.I devoured a lot of books like How to Win Friends and Influence People which might sounds corny but they do have a lot of good points. And I love reading anyway so it was fun.It took me years to be really socially comfortable with people even now I still have selective awkwardness towards some kind of people which I dont bother much because you gotta choose who you wanna be close with. But it was worth it. Human relationship is one of the best thing in the world be it friendship family romantic or communal.  And then of course the whole interests thing. Keep liking what you like because it is you and youll find many others that share the same passion. You can always PM me if you wanna talk about it because Im highly interested in this topic myself. Take care!,short,cnez04s,2,t5_2sgvi
2738502,0,t1_cnf28a9,EDIT  Wanted to add this.  The videos I linked are NSFW and show some very disturbing incidentsI dont think it contributes that much really.   Not saying it doesnt happen on occasion Im sure it does... but even then I think its more to do with the mindset some cops have and their lack of being able to control situations without violence. I think the biggest problem are some of the type of people not all of course who are often attracted to that line of work dont even have the desire to calm situations.  They are bullies basically.    The fact that often what they do goes unpunished giving a sense of above the law just makes it worse and enables them to continue.   When the cops start treating people like enemy combatants in a war zone This one in New Mexico shows a good example of that instead of like the citizens of their community try to assert their authority immediately instead being peace officers like they are supposed to and are allowed to do so very rarely being sufficiently punished for it prison time shit gets out of hand quickly.Just looking at the recent ones in the news...   The case where the cop gunned down that  year old boy who had a toy gun as the  caller said it probably was almost before the car stopped rolling he was much bigger than the kid.   There were  cops that responded to that scene too.  The one driving and the one hopping out of the car firing away.   The case in Ferguson the cop was a big guy too just like the guy he shot.   Not as big but still a big guy.  Theres always going to be someone bigger.The one in Walmart out in Ohio where the guy was holding a BB gun that Walmart sells amp dropped it as soon as he saw the cops and still got shot the cop looked bigger in terms of bulkiness and at least around the same height or taller than the guy he shot hard to tell. Sure sometimes the cop is smaller or shorter like the one in S.C. where the cop pulls a guy over for a seatbelt violation asks to see his license then shoots the guy when he reaches back in the car.  However there was no physical confrontation at all and it was pretty damn quick from cop stopping his car to shooting wildly luckily missing most of the time.The Eric Garner case yeah that guy was very large and the cop who administered the choke hold was smaller... but there were also  or  cops there watched the first  seconds of that messed up video again.   So not much question they were going to be able to handle the situation amp the cop putting him in the choke hold wasnt in danger at all.   Some of the cops were not tall some were average it looks like and one looked pretty big though not as big as Mr. Garner.The one about to blow up in the news out here involved a guy who was in his car still.  Looking at pictures of him he wasnt a big guy... no idea on the cops size but the cops multiple at the scene couldnt have really known his size since he was still in the car.  Just shot him in the head while he was in there unarmed.Basically there are incidents involving cops of all sizes it seems.   Those above of course are just a few recent ones.  There are many others fairly recent too unfortunately.   Also quite a few that involve children being abused by cops who are much bigger than them.   So I really dont think short stature is a contributing factor much at all... the mentality of some police officers and the willingness of departments to attempt to smooth things over lie andor accidentally lose evidence rather than punish the police officer who went way over the line giving the idea that they are above the law and can get away with it is the biggest issue.Ive followed a lot of these incidents fairly closely going way back to the late s early s.   A guy I knew back then from a fairly politically charged message board started CopWatch in his area because of bullshit like this basically a group that tries to keep the cops in line by filming them when needed.   Its a big problem in our country right now not only in large population areas either.  ,short,cnfctnz,1,t5_2sgvi

The argument still pertained to moral dessert so far as the other parents contended she didnt deserve to be on the team simply because of antidiscrimination laws when the other girls had to put in more physical work but its a bit applestooranges IMHO.I just think its a problem because youre deceiving people.  Just as men might get upset at finding out a girl padded her bra or lied about her weight in an online dating profile I think women simply see it as being dishonest about a physically unappealing quality of yours.  Because at least they say to themselves they wouldnt have bothered with you in the first place if they had known your true height.

2823289,0,t3_2sfn6a,Sure I think I can help.  As an AfricanAmerican I feel the same way about the stigma surrounding being Black in America.  I am against racism but I admittedly dont carry around some of the emotional baggage about it that some other black guys carry around.  This is probably because I didnt grow up in neighborhoods where I was harassed by police or where I faced a huge amount of racial discrimination.  So I dont feel its really part of my life. But I also have empathy.  I have had experiences where racism has affected me and so I dont brush off the complaints of other black men when they are angry about police harassment or other racial issues in the United States.

2847462,0,t3_2so6px,I see romance as a game that we are forced to play because of our biological nature. If you dont play games like poker or basketball that is a simple choice. Romance aka promoting our own genes frequencies is however the reason we exist and we cant just decide to not play it like other games because it is built into us. The problem is that in Romance like with all games some people are just natural winners some are natural losers most people will be OK at it if they try. No one will blame you for not trying to be a NBA pro if you are . But what if you are just as much a natural loser at a game you arent allowed to quit i.e. Romance barring suicide or neutering?You have to work harder for less.It may even be the case that you wont ever secure a mate that is both attractive to you AND attracted to you.And if you do think of the power dynamics in the relationship.

First off youre  your not even that short... thats like  below average and with good posture and clothing style you definitely wont appear to be far from . Certainly not short enough where its a major problem in the dating world. The guys on here who are  I would think have it a lot more difficult sadly.The other thing is you are  years old you asked out two girls got rejected and now your done? Are you serious man? Let me let you in on a little secret men get rejected all the time its a part of life. Tall men short men average men white men black men all get rejected many times in their lives. You just have to keep trying until you find women that are into you. You can ask any happily married man with a family in his ss how many times hes been rejected by a woman during his lifetime and I can almost guarantee he will say way more than  times. This is life women have always been picky you just have to step up your game.The most important thing I want to say that if these two girls honestly rejected you solely because of your height then you should be extremely thankful that they did reject you and that you didnt waste a second more of your life on them. Ask yourself if you really want to have a relationship with a girl who is shallow superficial or takes arbitrary things like the  rule as law because pop culture says she should? Trust me man you dodged a bullet there. You will surely meet other shallow materialistic women in your life bit you will surely also meet intelligent REAL ones as well. Of course these girls were in the  year old age range and are likely immature as hell like most  year olds anyways so Im not really surprised on this situation. Honestly most girls change a lot from  and you will likely find higher quality women after that.Which brings me to my last part. No matter if your  or  its always a good idea to not obsess over dating or women. Focus on yourself go through college do well get a good job work on your career goals exercise eat well dress well and generally continue to improve yourself and you will naturally become more attractive to the opposite sex especially late s and s when it matters. Dont be one of those guys at  years old crying and bitching about how he doesnt have a girlfriend and how lives overforever alone because you will give off a desperate needy pathetic vibe to women and hurt yourself regardless of your height.

In my experience GeoffreyArnold has never said anything remotely like the latter instead he points out that there does exist a stigma and that people often make assumptions based on the height of a person. He never says it prevents people from achieving things such as respect or the idea of being considered a powerful man. Height is neither a death sentence so to speak but it is also not completely irrelevant in the eyes of society. He merely says that it is more difficult for a shorter man to achieve being seen in certain ways for example being considered powerfulstrongrespectedetc than it would be say someone of an average height or my height.

3494016,0,t1_cpqj4ei,When I speak of academic feminists I mostly just mean my colleagues which is encouraging the bulk of the next generation of sociologists anthropologists and human geographersas best I can tellwill be rather sympathetic to height discrimination. gt Deconstructing gender normativity is a prime example of the difference between feminist theory and practice. Feminists argue that breaking down gender roles feminists will lead to greater equality but it does not. Why? Because empowerment is a privilege that men do not cannot enjoy because men are not valued by women in the same way that women are valued by men. Deconstructing gender roles doesnt lead to greater equality it leads to entrenching female privilege and male disadvantage particularly for shorter men who without the masculine gender role are valued far less by women than their taller counterparts.This is all very provacative. Why do you believe that breaking down gender norms would disadvantage short men? The norm as it stands now is that men should be tall strong dominant. If no longer shackled by those constraints dont you think over time shortness would no longer be seen as such a negative trait? Do you have any evidence to support that breaking down gender norms benefits women but hurts men other than to the extent to which greater equality shifts power that unfairly rested disproportionately with men to the balance it always deserved to be?

Its a hypocritical show that is clearly against racism yet reinforces heightism. Its not all in jest either  Will genuinely tries to put down Carlton with contempt for his height. The writers are absolutely a prime example of the stupidity and double standards found in our society. They found it perfectly permissible to mock Carltons height constantly yet they would obviously have been against making jokes about a characters skin colour being black.It seems to be one of those shows that gets a free pass because its so popular but for me the height issue has affected my overall view of it even though it has a lot of other good things going for it.EDIT As expected Im getting downvoted yet with no explanation as to how I am wrong.

Looking at a shorter person and assuming they are less intelligent because they are short is just like looking at a black person and assuming they are less intelligent because they are black. While on the whole it may in fact be true it means nothing on an individual basis.

3871461,0,t3_34rexk,The reason we see these kinds of baffling articles is simple people dont want to care about heightism. Its much easier and pays off more to contribute to it instead. Normally when a study is done with a large amount of demographics included and one group has some kind of feature that pops out people come running from afar to explain the results disprove the results test the results modify the results etc. But when people see a study with results showing short people have some kind of negative pop out the result is not more science. Apparently its articles about how dumb and subhuman short people are because that is what fits into societys narrative about short people. This is why you see research saying tall children are smarter really? Of course taller children are smarter. Theyre simply in a further stage of puberty  the rapid growth of a humans body and mind which occurs at varying times between children of the same cohort and determining the effect carries over to mature adults or that people who were malnourished are short and have lowered mental capacity and determining the effect is true across all short people regardless of nutrition. In fact where is the research showing the differences between healthy short or tall adults?

English is not Spanish and our adjectives dont have an inherent gender.  Tall just means more height.  But by creating the word tallette one implies that the word tall itself is masculine and so you need a feminine form of the word when referring to women who have more height.  Its really a vivid demonstration of just how insanely strong our culture has linked tallness to masculinity.  Not only is the concept of tall considered masculine in our society but even the fucking word is now considered masculine.  ,short,cubpuy7,4,t5_2sgvi

Being short make you lose  to  points being tall give you  to  points being average give you nothing.Being musculare gives you  to  being too thin or fat make you lose  to  etc.You dont need negociability attraction is nonnegociable anyway its less complex if you just aknowledge that some criterion can make you win or lose a lot of points.Like Nicolas Sarkozy he is  inches shorter than his wife he lose  points for this. But he had  bonus points for being Prsident de la Rpublique. Its not that the height was negociable it was he had a certain characteristic that made his height not so important.But anyway I digress.

I guess this is more of a problem of you being a white knight than me being a misogynist.only men face issues with being shortUh how did you even reach that conclusion? Like how?its the default for women to be uninterested on short menIt is. It really is that simple. Believe it or not Im totally fine with it unless it crosses over to mockery or even hatebeing short is some sort of curse that immediately makes your life worse than anyone taller than you.See? This is the one I have a problem with. Its worse. It plain and simply is literally worse. I wont hold it against you to simply not understand this of course but it really is. Now you have two versions of a person exactly identical save for height. When the taller version will earn more money get promotions easier be respected more not face dating discrimination again totally fine as long as its preference and not mocking or hate among other social and physical perks which are statistically proven how can you even tell me its not worse to be shorter with a straight face?The fact that youre thinking of me as a tall manYour flair on rtall helps my imagination.and that Im somehow privileged because of it is evidence that you do need to hear this shit.Oh you are.

5805056,0,t1_cxg8ls7,You said you think making adults grow taller is easier or should be easier you made the claim you should back it up. The burden of proof is for the one who makes the claims its not for the rest to try to prove you wrong unless you present evidence for what you say.gtIts well accepted that we have less understanding of the brain than any other part of human physiologyYes but that has nothing to do with anything really. Growth stops after the growth plates of bones fuse. During childhood theyre soft and spongelike to allow growing whereas in adults they are more like rocks. The same happens to the rest of the bone body they become much more rigid and less versatile thats why adults and older people are more likely to break bones than children. Once the bone has become as rigid as a rock theres absolutely nothing you could in your brain to make it grow bigger. Growth is not an onoff switch in our brains. Once you are an adult you can start having growth hormone for breakfast and youd still not grow a single inch. The only way is breaking the bones which is what those incredibily expensive painful and stupid bone lengthincreasing surgeries do and still that leaves you awfully disproportionate and prone to bone problems.The only moment in time when something could be done is during childhood and still not generally good idea. Growth hormone can induce growing but it tends to have other type of undesirable effects as well thats why its use is restricted to people with hormone deficiencies and not just given over the counter. When people say we still dont understand how the brain works they generally refer to consciousness cognition and the chemical processes that occur during them not finding magical switches that make you taller overnight.,short,cxgo79z,0,t5_2sgvi

6627025,0,t3_46dbab,Just watched the first video. Great stuff. I dont really agree in this argument that you cant question women on these preferences especially when the reasoning they use is often so ridiculouslike the shoes argument as if you had to match who you date to your wardrobe or how its gross that they would have to look down on a man shorter than them or when that reasoning is often rooted in other forms of prejudicehate. A lot of people might also argue that its perfectly fine if a woman said something like I would never date a black man because that is her preference but the fact remains that this preference could entirely be rooted in racismwhere you basically have someone who holds very racist ideals which could affect their professional decisions as well as their personal ones but only really being open about it in this context because of this notion that preferences cannot be questioned.  One aspect you could maybe expend on is how heightism against men from women might also heavily tie into traditional gender roles and how none of those women are actually questioning those gender roles despite now living in a society that actively defends their rights to live in a world that no longer imposes traditional gender roles on womenor to put it simply why would it still be completely acceptable to judge men based on these gender roles but very offensive to judge women on any kind of traditional gender role.Another thing to expend would be how for example that one of the women in the first video mentioned how it was important it was for a man to be able to pick her upusing this as a justification against short men despite the fact that short men could still certainly be strong enough to pick her up. But realistically why would that even be important? Why would this woman have this needdesire to be picked up as a fully grown woman? Arguably this is something that would be instinctual to children being picked up by their parents but not fully grown adult women. This either comes down to an issue of gender roleswhy isnt she concerned about womens ability to pick men up? or an issue of psychological development among womenwith those women essentially seeing themselves as children and seeing men as their caretakerparentprotector and romanticising that concept. Another point that you could possibly even delve into is this popular notion that women cannot or should not be accountable for their personal preferences or this belief that personal preferences cannot be changed or addressed internally by womensomething which was brushed on in the first video by the one woman who essentially overcame her own prejudices through selfawareness and rationalisation when she basically just realised that it really was never really that important to begin with. ,short,d04si8c,1,t5_2sgvi

He was simply trying to make light of a situation where his height was being questioned but also driving home the point that he is tall. He would not have felt the need to respond in the way that he did otherwise. Imagine he was asked if he was mixed race and he responded with how dare you Im completely white with the intention of making the audience laugh.

7373400,0,t3_4gbm87,gt...being a short male often means not getting any attention or chances at all. There is too much competition and its been shown that average and tall guys often add to their heights as well making it almost impossible for an honest shorter guy to be even considered.Im sorry but this is simply not true. Im  and have listed it honestly on both OKCupid and Tinder and in both cases I went on dates with lots of women. On OKCupid especially I imagine because it allows for a much more indepth profile I got a fair amount of unsolicited attention too. Online dating is harder for short guys but it isnt almost impossible for an honest shorter guy to be even considered. There do exist women usually short themselves who like short men. I had a few women on Tinder explicitly say they rightswiped in part because I was short. Hell Im not doing Tinder or OKC right now because I have a  girlfriend who is completely enamored with my stature. There are also a lot more women who are neutral or who prefer tall men but date short guys if they otherwise like them. I think my relative success was due to writing a good profile writing good messages and targeting women with compatible personalities interests and styles. In terms of other physical qualities Im in decent physical shape but Im not what anyone would call jacked. I did notice an increase in attention when I grew my hair long but thats the sort of thing some women love and some women hate. I think the key is just to find a niche that works for you and sell that. Long hair  beard seems to attract a lot of the outdoorsytypes of women I like. Anyway I wont argue that if you lied youd probably get more female interest but I will argue that being short is by itself making you invisible. That is wholly untrue in my experience. ,short,d2gayx3,7,t5_2sgvi

I think polyamory is a joke to be frank.gtAlso numbers pulled out of your ass are not very convincing. Its just a guesstimate. The reality is that height cutoffs do exist on dating websites. So if a guy is say  and lies and says  he will have more options. Do you think that isnt true? I dont think there is any available data out there but given how important male height generally seems to be it is logical that giving yourself a boost will increase your dating pool. Whether that small lie is something women will be mad about is anybodys guess. I doubt anyone is going to bring measuring tape with them just to be sure. So nah its a pretty safe bet to at least lie by an inch unless the girl is the same height. Guys already do that anyway by   inches.

Yeah I was bullied as a kid until I learned to stand up for myself. Mostly using wit and when necessary on rare occasion violence. Turns out not to many kids want to verbally pick on someone who can turn things around on them. And nobody wants to lay a hand on the guy wholl knee you in the nuts and when youre doubled over in pain proceed to knee you in the face.I think being a gun toting liberal atheist Marine is considered fairly unconventional. But youre right I dont think of women as inferior mostly because theyre not. Sure they may be inferior at certain tasks based on physical differences but there are other tasks for which they are physically better suited.

That is true of reddit in general and PEOPLE in general but youre less likely to talk about socially unacceptable stancessituationsfeelingsetc. when you are face to face with someone. And due to heightism expressing many different things regarding being short aside from going along with whatever the adult taller people get to say is not exactly acceptable in a lot of circles.. Petty? Being systematically discounted in different areas of your life not just dating  in the workforce trying to be a patron of certain businesses etc. and venting about it in a place where it IS acceptable to vent about it is anything but petty. Its actually NORMAL especially when people feel comfortable enough in that space to express views contrary to society. Especially when the cause of the frustration is someones heavily superficial bias.. Normal people  because short people arent normal apparently. You probably didnt mean it this way but language and word choice are very telling and the othering effect combined with general societal stances actually turns THIS COMMUNITY into the abnormal others as opposed to the ACTUAL OUTGROUP.. Tacking on and tiny is just an extra way of being an ass.

To think they actually implied that the marital problems were actually her fault by referring to Wainstein as brave.  The real kicker is the comments section  walltowall bashing of a short man.  I need to point out also that she is not much taller than him.  If you look at her feet her long pants are concealing the  inches heels she has on.  Take a good look at her left foot.   Without those heels on theyd probably be virtually the same height.  Michael Wainsteins  didnt do him much good in battling heightism.

Fitted shirts are always meant to be tucked in.Im on the more muscular side of things so Ill admit that these shirts tend to be a little tight and slightly restrictive in my movement.

8634987,0,t1_d6kub4g,gt you are consistent in denying that heightism is a universal biological thing which I agreeFirst of all dont conflate universal and biological.  A behavior can be based in biology but not universally expressed to the same degree.  And youve mistaken my position a bit.  I think the origins of heightism are biological.  But I also think the origins of racism sexism homophobia rape theft etc. are also biological in nature.  So its not that heightism isnt a product of evolution...its that this has no significance because ALL WIDESPREAD HUMAN NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS are a product of evolution.  It also shows that these behaviors can be controlled and discouraged through social stigma.  There is a social stigma against racism sexism rape and homophobia in certain cultures.  In cultures without that social stigma we get MORE racism sexism rape and homophobia.  So if we as society wanted to do it we could create a social stigma against heightism.  I dont think any society currently stigmatizes heightism but our Western culture is especially disgusting because we ENCOURAGE heightism.  We celebrate it.  We are no where close to stigmatizing it.  And we even attack anyone who tries to question heightism.  ,short,d6kzbab,2,t5_2sgvi

People who would argue that because the end result is the same not getting dates they being short and being ugly are equivalent...are ultimately just as big of a problem as the societal biases that hold short men as socially inferior to not care why a woman is or is not attracted to himself only truly caring that she is attracted at all holds women up or down depending on your perspective as social validation tools essentially dehumanizing them as their ability to empathize  becomes irrelevant validating their hypergamous behavior and normalizing it in society at the same time...making social factors like height or money even more relevant.,short,d77hezs,4,t5_2sgvi

9697697,0,t3_5dxajn,Youre too focused on your height and youre projecting your insecurities on it blaming it for every problem. Thats withholding you from improving your way of thinking which seems to be the issue. Contrary to all popular belief amongst men women dont necessarily look for pretty men they fall for those that are fun and confident and show they are okay with who they are. Being with a confident person makes you appreciate yourself in return because you mirror confidence. You seem to be lacking appreciation of yourself. Why are you focusing on the only issue you couldnt change? You did so much already by tricking genetics eating healthy and looking good. Why is the need to bash yourself instead of focusing on being happy with what you have? This strive for perfection may have helped you in the past but if its constant it gets toxic and eats you up. Judging by the post this mentality is also changing your daily life because selfcriticism probably makes you ignore other peoples compliments and remember only criticism. If you had a healthy mindset you probably wont hear comments about Napoleons complexes because people wont even think about such stereotypes around you. However thinking you arent worth much makes you super conscious and you overhear every snarky comment assuming its about you. Trust me its probably not. If you havent been with a girl for that long youre at the point of overthinking so much everything you actually need to focus on your mind not the body. Try those exercises like sitting and writing down a list of what you like about yourself and then a list of what you hate about yourself and compare the two. ,short,da8g4bz,2,t5_2sgvi

But I honestly dont feel like tall women have it that much worse. The only tall friend I have that complains about struggling to find a BF has told me that she doesnt think she could ever date a guy under  shes . So I kinda feel like her dating difficulties are largely selfimposed by having a standard that very few guys can meet. My other tall friends do just fine dating.

11319698,0,t1_dfc794p,gt Since youre making this a personal discussion... Ive been with chicks of varying sizes and proportions. One such girl had perfect tits something even more special because she was Asian however our politics didnt agree. There are other examples that I wont subject you to.I understand that you are a narcissist but you dont seem to understand what Im saying. Attracting women with larger tits is hard enough for you that you cant attract one with the qualities you want. gt stop self limiting your own dating options So women arent rejecting short men?gt overall my girlfriend is the best match for me in terms of personality and appearanceShe is the best you could get and youve admitted as much her appearance  to your preference and the fraction of women interested in you who do meet your preference may not have the personality you want from a partnergt if I reactively dumped her itd be tough to find someone who liked me as much as she does.threadgt raceIf you are insecure about your race then either you are a ridiculous person or women are basically Nazis and anything that happens to them is fair game. No one should be insecure about their race. INB just be with your own kind bruh its only biologically natural to reject people of other races. Very common belief among women on reddit. gt wealthWork. No sympathy for those in this position unless something truly horrible has happened to hold them back. And that is rare. Not to mention that if money is so important that you cant get a girlfriend then women are precisely the shallow unfeeling animals that angry male redditors claim they are. gt musculature Work out see a doctor. I say this as a man who has been under lbs for all my adult life. gt dick length and girthBuy a traction device. Women will at least claim that penis size doesnt matter they dont even try to do this with height.   gt how long they last in bedAre you being serious right now? You can absolutely control that. gt refractory period You are really out there if you believe there are millions of women rejecting men for their refractory period. Sexual incompatibility is one thing but thats not so much a rejection resulting from female preference as it is failure to sustain an existing relationship due to personal differences. Some people are incompatible that is different from rejecting a man  inches taller than you because too short.gt facial attractivenessMost women claim that facial attractiveness is subjective. I suppose they really are just liars. gt inability to grow a beard MPBYou have options for hair problems and they get better every year. Joe rogan talked about it recently baldness. gt I wouldnt freak out...Im mostly perfect for herSaid every boyfriend ever.Most boyfriends are not perfect for their current girlfriend and odds are your girlfriend would leave you the moment she found a more attractive man with a similarbetter? personality. gt So basically stop self limiting your own dating options out of insecurity and fear of getting hurt. Yes some here have been rejected so many times it seems pointless One of these things is not like the other....gt make all prior failures irrelevantAre you capable of empathizing with men who have been alone well into their s and s due to immutable characteristics? If you were I doubt you would call their failures irrelevant. They lost their youth and it will foster a strong inferiority complex as the women they liked repeatedly chose other men over themselves. Women have taught these men that they have little sexual or romantic value to others. ,short,dff2hky,0,t5_2sgvi
