435890,0,t1_cfpxgv4,Okay  I like the coherent attempt to generate an example.  HoweverIn your example the land is presumed to already be owned and gained value long ago as people moved to the area and began bidding and exchanging ownership of land.  Then you specify abandonment.  Because of this there is no homesteadingimprovement argument to be made by anyone  the land was homesteaded long ago and already has high market value and there is simply an unusual condition of no one claiming any ownership of the m worth of property.  Youve then arbitrarily inserted workers over an arbitrary gunman who never had a legit claim to the property either.

Deductionsloopholes also play a role but a smaller role.  Most large investors gtM yearly income pay  income tax their income is taxed at the  capital gains rate minus  deductionsloopholes.

2265761,0,t1_clrq5l2,gtIn truth in the case of individuals their actual voting is not to be taken as proof of consent even for the time being. On the contrary it is to be considered that without his consent having even been asked a man finds himself environed by a government that he cannot resist a government that forces him to pay money render service and forego the exercise of many of his natural rights under peril of weighty punishments. He sees too that other men practice this tyranny over him by the use of the ballot. He sees further that if he will but use the ballot himself he has some chance of relieving himself from this tyranny of others by subjecting them to his own. In short he finds himself without his consent so situated that if he use the ballot he may become a master if he does not use it he must become a slave. And he has no other alternative than these two. In selfdefence he attempts the former. His case is analogous to that of a man who has been forced into battle where he must either kill others or be killed himself. Because to save his own life in battle a man takes the lives of his opponents it is not to be inferred that the battle is one of his own choosing. Neither in contests with the ballot  which is a mere substitute for a bullet  because as his only chance of selfpreservation a man uses a ballot is it to be inferred that the contest is one into which he voluntarily entered that he voluntarily set up all his own natural rights as a stake against those of others to be lost or won by the mere power of numbers. On the contrary it is to be considered that in an exigency into which he had been forced by others and in which no other means of selfdefence offered he as a matter of necessity used the only one that was left to him.,libertarianmeme,clrrnko,1,t5_2te5l

This is all driven by the need for profit crude ores from Africa are shipped to India to be refined and smelted into components to be assembled in the US to be used in agricultural equipment in Brazil in order to grow corn to be sold back to Africa. Why didnt Africans grow the food them selves? because it would have been more expensive to achieve identical results. What Im getting at is that capitalwealth grows it doesnt just displace like most people assume. The wealth we have on this planet is growing to slow to accommodate the increase in demand.Thats what this recession buzzword means a contraction of the global economy. But why?! What is happening or isnt now that was before you ask? combination of bills coming due poor loans brought on by easy bank credit scams slowly dissolving global fiat money and increase in government growth no not just the US gov.Now how to fix it all!Step  Allow private currencies to compete with the dollar.Youll start seeing stores opening up and people getting hired.Step  Remove all wage price import amp export controls Your standard of life will be higher then you remember at this point.Step  Sell off all federal assets profits are returned to all taxes paid along with an Im sorry i wasted the other . note.Youll start seeing Ethiopians on vacation in the US Step  Incrementally remove public sector fields yes ALL of them.Its pure imagination at this point the opportunities are endless.

5591773,0,t1_cwq40nh,A number of business structures sole proprietor coops etc are available under both economic systems but they each are bias to different business structures. For example in Mutualism freemarket of Personal property law selfmanagement ability to manage ones own work is a legal right people join as equals members in power this means work is planned and done democratically. Under Capitalistic Private property work is planned plutocratically capital wealth ownership in the business equates managerial power workers are not equal to capitalists.Under Personal property regimes the capitalist will find searching for someone to be subservant for a wage an employee difficult as being an equal in management and profits is the legal norm with Personal property. In Capitalism employees must buy the Private means of production before one can manage their own work therefore selfmanagement is a plutocratic privilege as opposed to a basic right.Personal property lends itself to democratic management and Private property to plutocratic capital based management. Allowing the ability to switch property system is keeps both capital and labor from exploiting each other in their own single system. I hope that made more sense.,libertarianmeme,cwq7mxy,2,t5_2te5l

7011622,0,t1_d1a8uqm,A combination of a couple of different things drew me away from AnCapism not necessarily why I am libertarian instead that would be way too long. First to the other person I do believe in the NAP that is not one of my issues. I also dont see it as a utilitarian convenience. I couldnt give two shits about utilitarianism I just care about overall freedom in an applicable sense.The first reason is the most common that you here Its not realistic. Im not saying an AnCap society isnt realistic those have been done before and proven that they can work if the right culture is there. I think that its unrealistic to assume that the USA where I live has the capability of ever turning into that. Its almost as unrealistic for libertarianism to exist in the USA but there are some movements such as PFS and a decent number of people have libertarian ideas so it is theoretically possible. Or at least possible for it to exist somewhere in the US. My second issue is that AnCaps are very good at winning arguments. This sounds like a good thing but its not because of how they win I am guilty of winning many arguments this way which is the only reason I recognized it eventually. They focus on one flaw in the opponents arguments and rather than accepting that the argument as a whole has some credibility but that part does not they only argue about it and make both sides focus on that knowing full well that when it gets to its extreme they will have one. To me this isnt a way to engage and learn and if a lot of someones knowledge comes from this the knowledge is rather incomplete. As a whole a lot of them are good at hiding logical fallacies into their arguments as well sometimes without even realizing that they are doing it but thats just because a lot of them are good debaters.My third issue is that they take everything to the extreme. Whenever an issue is brought up they see the two extreme ends of it and argue about those without accepting that its possible that there is nuance involved and the best solution may be somewhere between the two extremes or that there can be multiple equally good solutions either at the extremes or in the middle.Finally when it comes to current politics I find a lot of the AnCap solutions to how to handle them lacking. In an ideal world where they get to build society from the ground up seasteading maybe? this doesnt matter but in a world where not everyone will want to be an AnCap and you have to take politics into account the philosophy was just lacking in that area.As I posted to someone else Ive been away from the philosophy for a couple years so some of what Im saying may be outdated.,libertarianmeme,d1b44kx,1,t5_2te5l

Im not trying to be obtuse. I agree that attempts or baby steps whatever toward socialism are bound for failure. Again much much of Venezuelas problem stem from the fact that they peg theyre exchange rate. It has everything to do with market economics. ,libertarianmeme,d41amym,2,t5_2te5l

But look at the original comment I replied to that wasnt about property rights. The fundamental question there was would you rather police use more discretion thus emphasizing civil and human rights while risking that more criminals get away or would you rather they shoot first and ask questions later thus emphasizing security while risking more innocent lives and violating the rights and liberties of their citizens?But again youre right everything is on a spectrum.
