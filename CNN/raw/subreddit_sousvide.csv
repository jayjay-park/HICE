759157,0,t3_22til5,Personally I think the batch of new circulators Anova Sansaire etc are a more economical and versatile choice than an an appliance like the Supreme.The ability to use a vessel matching the size you need is a big advantage as well as not having to dedicate counter space. Personally I have a Sansaire and I use either a big pot or a .G Cambro as my water container. These circulators just clip on to the side of the pot. As for a vacuum sealer its optional but IMHO highly recommended. You can use a standard Zip Lock bag and the immersion technique to remove most of the air in the bag but having a sealer is so much easier and comes in handy for other purposes.You dont get a fully cooked steak in  minutes. Sorry. Most steaks will take at least an hour at F for rare.  There are a number of sources for timing and temperature  theres plenty of posts here that recommend online and book sources.Im going to say that I dont believe most people using sous vide do it for the ease factor. Personally I dont think it easier than traditional cookery. Sous vide gives you more control over the cooking process  more consistency and more choices as to how the food is cooked. But its certainly not quicker nor easier.And yes you can cook and chill and freeze larger batches of food but Id be surprised if a majority of folks do that.,sousvide,cgqkmn8,2,t5_2rzyz

926144,0,t1_ch9g0io,ok I get it. You make it then reheat it. Assuming you have an external bag vac foodsaver or similar here is what I doMake a much bigger bag then you think you need. Put in your first food. Seal that pouch off put the next food in seal it off. repeat. You almost certainly wont be able to vaccum the pockets but you can maybe do a ghetto vaccum via the bag in a bowl of water. In any case as long as the food is already fully cooked and you are just reheating you dont really need a vaccum at all. You can weight the bag down with a cup or something if it floats too much. Oh in case its not obvious you should reheat at about  degrees less then the lowest temp you used to cook the food or you will overcook it. ,sousvide,ch9k2xy,2,t5_2rzyz

1180859,0,t3_27nbp8,Im looking to spend  max but would prefer to spend less. Idea is to do best value under  not best machine available for .There seem to be four main options vp for  vp for  with immersion circulator included vp for  DMC  for The first two are dry piston pumps and the last two are oil pumps. Ive heard oil pumps are faster quieter pull a stronger vacuum last longer and are more moisture tolerant but Im not sure its worth the price premium. The ARY Vacmaster machines get mostly good reviews with a few mixed comments and I cant find much at all about the DMC.Other differences the vp has a tall chamber compared to other options. However it probably pulls a weaker vacuum. There are mixed reports about the lid being fragile many people say theyve had no problem. Opening the lid properly requires two hands. The vp is marked as having a shorter cycle time than the vp though both machines are oil pumps and opening the lid requires only one hand. The vp is the cheapest vacmaster oil pump sealer and seems to get high marks all around except on price.I welcome any thoughts on the above machines!,sousvide,ci2gssd,4,t5_2rzyz

I now do IT for a mid size enterprise company. No matter what steps a person says they take ensure you ask them to take them. Often you want more detail and more insight. That being said never ever trust a customer troubleshooting steps to be equivalent to your own. They are a great way to have a benchmark and some times they produce results that are clear indicators that those steps are completed but things like tightening or loosening are stuff that every tech support will always ask you to do again.

Just to rule the weaker heating element out as a factor try insulating the pot a bit while shooting for that f hold.  Wrap in some towels or something to keep the heat in and make sure you have a lid or cover with aluminum foil at least.Let me know how it goes.

2604828,0,t3_2pon66,Honestly sounds like you just need to find the sweet spot of how you like your food to come out. I have done chicken and steak and I just started a  hour brisket last night. So far everything i have done has turned out amazing. I do mostly ribeyes and do them at C to get them medium and havent experienced the issues with the fat. But when I first did it I thought medium was going to be to cooked for me. But having the whole steak medium all the way through actually made me prefer medium over medium rare in this case.

5765525,0,t3_3u2zd9,I was part of the user tests at Chefsteps for the Joule. From what I saw and experienced this will be a major upgrade from my current anova one which I love. They really have designed this thing from the ground up and they innovated in a lot of ways that others have not. For starters the magnetic base works flawlessly and allows you to quickly attach it to any pot or even a metal plate in a container it is very sturdy but also easy to remove. The inlet is extremely well designed and the machine can safely operate with probably less than an inch of water the water outlet is actually above the inlet. The circulator really is very quiet as well.It has a great high quality flexible cord and I believe the cord will be able to wrap around the unit and secure using the removable clamp.When I first saw that there were no physical controls on the circulator itself I was very sceptical. But after using the app I ate my words. The app is flawless and very well designed. In a way I think the app should be the real selling point. It is clear that they spent months and months developing it and its definitely the best kitchen app I have ever used bar none. The interface is so well designed that it makes interacting with my older machines seem very clunky.You would think that using an app would complicate things but its as simple as using a chromecast. You plug the machine in and open the app. If you are already on wifi with your phone you are good to go. It takes less than  taps to start cooking. It takes more with my machines with physical buttons or onboard touch screens. Smartphones do make a much better interface when developed correctly.The test model connected via bluetooth and wifi and the app connected via either one.When I last spoke with them the Chefsteps team told me that they plan to launch with both Android and Iphone support.TLDR After using the prototype and App I will definitely be buying one.,sousvide,cxbrlsi,11,t5_2rzyz

If youre doing sous vide a cheap cut can be plenty flavorful and tender without adding so much salt. And some flaked salt to finish provides a great mouth feel too.

5826290,0,t1_cxj6j5o,Yeah expensive is relative and I suppose if we consider we are cost of what we are cooking its not that big an expense. I imagine thermocouplkes could be had in volume or lower end for around  or less.The other factor is most sous vide cooking isnt about getting the food to temp its about leaving it at temp for a while to break down protiens etc. If you are looking to eat sooner there are much faster ways to cook.,sousvide,cxjcoop,2,t5_2rzyz

5886072,0,t3_3vt9ey,I also was promised this service when my circulator suddenly quit heating. Unfortunately not only did they not ship my brand new unit when they got notification from Fedex they responded to my inquiries with only weak excuses about why nothing was happening and assurances that Id be emailed when there was any status change. I never got any status updates. In the end my replacement unit did not ship until the evening after they received my return so I didnt get it until a couple weeks after the original failure.I explained that mine had quit heating in the middle of a long cooking process and that I made plans based on their service promise but the service rep did not seem to care. Their communication was misleading or nonexistent.I kept my halfcooked organic duck parts in the fridge hoping to continue the cooking process within a couple of days when I should have just abandoned the project and frozen everything.

Usually this is made obvious by the sous vide bath temperature being a few degrees above what youve set it at.

7800026,0,t3_4m4dqc,Thanks everyone Just quickly Kenji saysgtThe best part? Once cooked you can chill the eggs in an ice bath and store them in water in the refrigerator for up to a few days. To serve them just submerge them in warm  to F water for ten minutes or so and theyre as good as fresh.Dumb question here but as the egg is pasteurized from the cook initially and is safely still in its shell the above should be fine right?  It wont develop issues pathogens after a while?   Just checking as being able to have one ready to go like that seems super handy ,sousvide,d3ss897,1,t5_2rzyz

7915627,0,t1_d45cu2t,This is similar to my restaurants recipe but I can give you some tips  depending on how you want to serve it hot or cold.I would use g pudding rice not arborio. It makes a thicker variation which is easier to control texture wise. I dont know if you wanted the seeping liquid texture but thats really hard to plate in a restaurant.For both after the sous vide remove it and reduce down over a very low inductionflame until a spoon dragged through leaves no trace.For coldRemove from the pan and spread on a baking sheet to chill. Scrape into a mixing bowl and add to it ml whippingdouble cream that has been beaten to medium peaks. Fold in smoothly. This is my favourite variation of it.For hot To the hot rice pudding add  egg yolks and ml double cream. Stir rapidly and keep simmering until it thickens again. There you go!

Were building and moving right now in addition to beta testing so there is a lot going on.Id like to write up an in depth review and I have that pencilled in this weekend but my experience is pretty darned good.  The Joule does what it says on the label.  It heats much faster than my Polyscience Pro for the same volume of water.  Twice as fast at least.  I dont have an Anova but I know a lot of folks in the beta have them and they are reporting similar results vs the Anova.  Precision is good.  The unit is quiet.  Pairing is simple and easy.  Controls are intuitive.  App is responsive.  Right now there is an intermittent problem with connectivity from time to time but Emmett and some other folks from CS are planning to come out and look at it in my location.  I strongly suspect that this is my network configuration as I have things locked down pretty tightly and I tend to micromanage connections at the router level.  All in all would totally recommend.  We havent used the unit a ton this week my bad! but we flogged it in the week up to the th making  pounds of meat  long cooks for pork shoulder  hour sessions back to back for flank steak and mojo pork high temp for veggies...

8522180,0,t1_d663vmv,True all the circulators do the same thing but for appliance that is meant to be used regularly after time different design aspects of a circulator might be more convenient or bug you overtime. I think aspects like the user interface how it attaches how easy it is to clean how it stores how much noise it makes etc are worth considering when throwing down . You have to live with the design decisions the manufacturer made granted the devices are working reliably and arent failing.One thing Im really looking forward to about the Joule is that its completely sealed. Currently with the Anova I wrap a small towel around the base of the device where it meets the lid cutout of my Cambro container. I do this to keep steam from entering into the back vent and into the electronics of device which has caused the device to shut off on its own before. Not fun.

8929651,0,t1_d7k72d2,I get what youre saying that people should read the manual and learn about their product to be able to use it as intended ultimately get the most out of it. Im trying to argue that for manufacturers sake they should try to make products that never make users feel awkward and instead make the users feel confident regardless if they read the manual or not. The products that are iconic that people love to use always have awesome elegant user interfaces and those are the products that sell best.Vitamix blenders and KitchenAid stand mixers have perfect controls in my opinion granted they are simpler devices than immersion circulators but bear with me. You look at their controls and you know exactly what theyre going to do no surprises no awkward experiences or negative feelings. In addition to generally being reliable workhorses more importantly theyre a joy to use. Consumers are happy to buy them recommend them to their friends and consumers are happy to buy them again when they need replacing.The Anova Precision Cooker is a reasonable standard to meet for ease of basic use. The current temperature and set temperature are each separately labelled and the startstop button has a familiar and meaningful playpause icon. It doesnt do anything unexpectedly like change color while using the temperature dial like the Nomiku Wifi does in the video. The only real knock I give it is for not having a more obvious way for switching between Celsius and Farhrenheit. I recently gave an Anova PC to a nontechnical friend and I was happy to do so because I knew shed enjoy using it. I would not have given her the Nomiku Wifi even if I had gotten it for free. I honestly could see her using the Nomiku once or twice then leaving it in her cupboard.I get what Nomiku was trying to do with the color change highlight and alert that those temperatures are in the danger zone to try to help people avoid getting sick. That is a noble thing to attempt. However as seen in the video the color change is unexpected and its not obvious to a novice what the color change is for the color change just causes confusion. Worse is the action button resetting the time counter. It might be handy but theres no obvious context for that to happen. These two examples hint towards an overall unpleasant user experience.Seeing stuff like this happen really makes me better understand why ChefSteps made the big move away from using ondevice screens and controls. Youre so limited by the tiny screens you can fit on a device. You can do so much more and provide a far superior user experience with a smartphone. Nomiku was limited by what their screen could show so their compromise was the color change and the thermometer icon which left the guy in the video confused. There isnt enough information there. Hypothetically with an app alert for the danger zone you could explain in text what is going on along with picturesvideoweb linksetc. Theres so much more flexibility and opportunity with a smartphone vs an ondevice screen.TLDR If Nomiku and other product manufacturers want consumers to love their products and recommend said products to their friends theyll have to try harder to make their products a joy to use rather than leaving consumers feeling awkward and confused.,sousvide,d7l7nl1,1,t5_2rzyz

10167464,0,t1_dbw9wd5,Hmm thats a good point that could become a nasty mold situation after a while. You got me wondering how you could fill inside the lid with foam at least around the hole without the expanding foam making the hole close up again. A few possibilities that come to mind Drill a smaller hole through one side of the lid where you plan to make the big hole. Inject some expanding foam let it harden. Then use the hole saw to cut the big hole through the hardened foam. You still get the hole size you want but it should be sealed by the expanding foam. Edit this might require a small vent hole drilled elsewhere in the lid so that air in the lid can escape as the foam expands. This hole could be sealed with caulk laterInstead of expanding foam maybe you could use flexible foam like the type you slip over pipes to insulate them. Cut the big hole then stuff some of the insulation inside the lid around the hole to fill most of the gap. Then use caulkRTV silicone to coat the exposed foam to seal it against water.  The foam takes up most of the space and the caulksilicone mainly have to act as a coating but they dont need to try and fill the large gap inside the lid. ,sousvide,dbwjdjv,2,t5_2rzyz

10265009,0,t1_dc7k6hi,i agree with you and i would definitely prefer to host the stuff myself too but the average punter generally couldnt.  theyd likely need to have some dynamic dns set up with upnp which is the devil so the app knew what to talk to and so that the cooker was externally exposed.  or an intermediary public server which both the cooker and app knew to talk to which is basically what we have now.in terms of security for the average punter i think not exposing the anova to the internet is a better idea.  if anova culinary are asleep behind the security wheel dont have a csirt team watching and get popped i doubt the attackers are going to get much of value.  maybe they can ruin my dinner.  having not yet analysed a wifi pairing session though i dont yet know for sure what they do and dont send back to base.if you took a look at the tcp session stream data from the device itself and figured out how it worked theres no reason you couldnt emulate the service yourself and redirect the dns queries to your own infrastructure.  should be relatively easy.  the app just works by making http get and post requests to URIs related to the cookerid and the jobid of the current cook so thats a piece of cake.,sousvide,dc7lf30,1,t5_2rzyz

Both apps are resources so install them regardless of which device you pick.Anova is currently running a sale so the WiFi model is  until .  New Anova models are coming out this summer so I expect there will be more sales.I would recommend you start out with an existing pot.  You can get some cheap ping pong balls if you want for insulation.  Once you are more familiar with sous vide cooking you can decide if you want to buy a dedicated vessel.  I like to use a modified cooler but cambrotype containers are also very popular.If you dont already have a vacuum sealer you can do just fine with ziplock bags.  Ultimately you may want a sealer both for cooking and for buying in bulk and freezing.For resources check out Serious Eats Chef Steps and Doug Baldwins sous vide page.

10652201,0,t3_5sf39t,Im not sure how a chamber vacuum would necessarily be better than a foodsaverstyle for this problem. The chamber vac bags dont need a textured side of course. But unless the texture is what caused your failure then Im not sure how a different style of bags would really change things. The chamber sealers might make widerhotter seals of course. If your seals failed you could try something like doublesealing one location if your unit allows that. Seal then without opening the unit do another seal in the exact same location. If your problem is that the plastic isnt fully melting together its possible that this could help. I wouldnt do that for every seal though. Maybe just the outer seals in case this actually made things worse somehow. If its better it protects the others. And if its worse you still have the others. Can you pull your seals apart by hand? I tried something recently as a test. I put some water in between the film then sealed that area without vacuuming. I could not pull the seal apart. At least you can test your bag performance easily enough without endangering food by sealing bags of water you could freeze it first if needed or anything soup cans whatever. Then cook them like you did and see if it fails. You could even add food coloring inside the bag if you wanted an easier way to detect small leaks. ,sousvide,ddeoy10,2,t5_2rzyz

People love when I bust out the Bernzomatic torch.  oz is a bit much for such a rich dessert so I use the  oz Ball jars instead.If you havent already I highly recommend watching the Facebook live video of Nick demonstrating the torching. In it he shows how to rotate the jar to control the melting sugar like a lava flow to evenly coat the surface of the custard. If youre aiming the flame at the  oclock area of the custard and rotating the jar to control the sugar lava flow you should easily avoid shattering your jars unless your jars are old and have taken a beating.gt Also remember to wipe down the jar lip to clean off sugar before torching.

10804269,0,t3_5uij93,Striplion or sirloin? Strip is the more tender cut  one hour will do it fine  hours is getting close to excessive.  hours for sirloin is about right. Dont add fats to the bag. Salt amp pepper is fine. I also like to add a couple drops of sesame oil or N fish sauce or soy sauce and maybe liquid smoke Most important dry the steak off after it comes out of the bag. Get it really dry. Dry it again  if youre getting a weak sear moisture on your steak is the most likely culprit. You can bump your crust up by searing briefly before bagging and prior to seasoning. Also a tiny amount of baking soda prior to searing will help develop that crust err on the cautious side. When searing press the steak down with a spatula to ensure good contact with the pan. ,sousvide,ddudugo,3,t5_2rzyz
