8215382,0,t1_d53zyj5,So Im debating a phd but really a phd is only of benefit if you intend to be a professor and want to contribute to the scientific knowledge base.  I know this is going to sound bitter but I want to actually make change.  Too often a professor makes great strides in her research only to be blocked by politics or lack of grant funding academic competition.  I hope to collaborate with researchers in the future so their work translates more directly to improving our society instead of being left to collect dust in the archives.Competition is not how you should look at the situation.  You are attending a school to increase your credentials and learn how to do research.  The keepingupwiththejones mentality will not help you get smarter in grad school.  Conversely if you focus on competition and not selfimprovement you will work hard to appear to know things and then easily sound like youre full of poop.  Its easy for me to tell who put in the work and who didnt.  Being humble being able to admit when you dont know something and focusing on networking is your goal in grad school.  If you compete with your classmates then theyre less likely to recommend you for that awesome position at their company years after you graduate. Other students expertise shouldnt make you worried it should make you excited!  So what if you dont get a .?  The knowledge you miss by snobbing the person beneath you or being competitive with the person above you is a waste of effort and stress.  You have the smarts you have.  You know what you know and no amount of fluff or cramming will let people think you have the leg up.  If you dont know something then you dont know it and its best to admit you dont know so you can LEARN.As another side note be careful with the smart Chinese students commentary.  Its kinda racist and encourages the Model Minority myth.  Honestly I saw more students from Africa and the Middle East than Chinese.  Also having worked abroad in Asia I know that the international students arent always smart but sometimes privileged.  Some students parents have the money to send their kids to school especially if theyre performing poorly in native schools.  That stereotype is hurtful and wont help you get a better grade by studying with the token Asian in your cohort.,grad_school,d54h7am,2,t5_2rj08

To me the best way I found was just to take as many practice tests as I could and spend time reviewing my weaker areas. The ETS GRE website also lets you download a couple practice tests for free with their power prep I cant recall the name exactly product. ,grad_school,ddg3b4e,1,t5_2rj08
10729208,0,t1_ddmk0jp,Well Im ready a research assistant for over  year now at my current job and had some RA experience at undergrad too. Currently I do everything from data collection to input and management preparing analysis and data summaries basically all the grunt work. At my job Im fairly maxed out as far as new responsibilities go because Im essentially doing as much as I can with just a BA. The MA would undoubtedly help me because its specifically a program that focuses on methodology and analysis the  pieces that I cant get at my job. And with the good graces of my supervisor I should be able to practice what I learn while on the job.Also I got a little snoopy last night and looked at some of the linkedin profiles of the other candidates to the program low I know and  actually had related MA degrees already and everyone else has just about the same background as me. So I now know that it wasnt just a low GRE score that disqualified me. Which was a relief tbh.Im also pretty positive that I want the PhD because Im set on being a researcher. From what Ive seen from people employed at my job the PhD really makes a major difference in employment opportunities pay and the ability to research whatwhere you want.I know that I should have had a broader grad school list but it was limited because  its a small field and there are not many programs out there to begin with and  I have a bit of a niche research interest and I want to stay local in my city where the  top programs happen to be.But thank you for the feedback! I appreciate hearing it. I hadnt even thought about deferring the MA for a year didnt even think it was possible but its definitely worth considering.,grad_school,ddmmyt0,1,t5_2rj08
11275353,0,t1_df2786r,But whats the point of simply finishing a degree. Sure you should see it as a goal but it should be a stepping stone not an end goal. My advisor tells me all the time that anyone can get a PhD. Whats important is what you do with it.,grad_school,dfa1mku,1,t5_2rj08
11314773,0,t1_df3mj7k,yes planning ahead could be a good one... thats hysterical that they have to police the talks that way lol. I find most of the ones in our department to be pretty boring but occasionally am very pleasantly surprised,grad_school,dfeifai,1,t5_2rj08

The hospital I work at some people have colored hair like dark purple and peircings but none facially. You could probably get away with two piercings if theyre small.The hair situation is best pulled back in case there is a code or even a regular medical procedure youd want to be able to see clearly. Patients can be asses and yank your hair or it could get caught on medical equipment. You can pull your hair back over the tops of your ears to hide the cartilage ones but remember hospitals want professional looking people so keep it classy.,grad_school,dghjg57,2,t5_2rj08
