3787510,0,t1_cqnugtc,Look at it like this.These guys are determined to make a living pouring their days into animation and refining their craft to the point that it enables them to do this.Markiplier screams at video games and makes an absurd amount of money. I dont hate markiplier the person. Ive never even met the dude so I cant formulate an opinion on that. Ive attempted to watch his videos to see what the appeal is and I just dont get it. Its just people sitting there watching someone play video games and trying to act over the top and wacky in some cases. Animation is fucking hard and its not something you can step into right away. On the other hand guys like pewdiepie are just recording themselves playing video games and making a ridiculous amount of money for it. Ultimately I guess theyre doing something that makes them happy and thats fine. All the power to them. I just think its a copout having worked towards something I make a living doing and happen to enjoy but thats not the point.This is not a knock against markiplier or other people like game grumps or pewdiepie as people.

The film was written by Tommy Wiseau The guy who stars in it with the odd looking face and long black hair who also completely funded it the craziness being that the characters spoke like he really spoke and that was with the actors attempting to make what he wrote more human. Gregg Sestero who played Mark in the film wrote a book about how he met Tommy and the experiences on the set. Which is being made into a movie and its an incredibly interesting read and definitely improves the watching of the film.

The writing style of Ethan and Hila line up pretty good with the cabins aesthetics as a consumer viewpoint and Im pretty sure they share at least a minority segment of their viewerbase. A potential for collaborative work on a strictly business viewpoint would could be preferable for both parties.. They are jews from israeli and moving to a new country aint always that eazy. If the crew could hold their hand on their inaugral trip to a Wawa everyone would be happy. Theyre also turning their sometimes paying hobby into a monetized business just like the cabin did not that long ago and solidarity between independent parties is always good.But again what Im just sayin is they need to start kissing now so that they can hold hands in a podcast somewhere along the timeline of life.,Sleepycabin,ctbvkhh,1,t5_31vmq

Hell after learning what they do I am surprised they even do a podcast. I do not envy their position as I used to. I mean they even state this kind of event when referring to their cartoons of people just going Why is it taking so long faggot pump out cartoons every day all day. Its a long process to edit and record audio not to mention the times that it might not go that well. Like we get maybe hrhrs of content but they could be at it for maybe hrs which also translates into another couple hours of editing to make sure it isnt offense or long pauses arent there.

If I had a similar channel that was growing rapidly Id use it to maximize profits too. Endslates an office hiring an editor the whole shebang. SleepyCabin is already doing  of those things It IS a business after all. But if you want to believe its the result of Makers influence and not sound business practice thats your decision.

And I realize Im probably going to get downvoted to fucking hell and back and so are you most likely ahah but to people saying oh its just a game who cares thats kind of the point its just a fucking game! Why does it bother you so much if other people get invested in it to the point of going out of your own way to fuck with their enjoyment? It just baffles me a little. I mean I dont fucking get people who collect things just in general especially when said things serve no purpose other than to sit on a shelf or whatever I think its one of the most pointless hobbies ever yet I would not go out of my way to like destroy someones collection of fucking stamps or anime figures or whatever people even collect these days.

6060042,0,t1_cydetc1,Learning piano to write music is useful because it has a tremendous range and can essentially act as a oneinstrument microcosm for all the voices in a song. Even learning a few simple pieces will teach you a lot about bass lines rhythm melody harmony polyphony voicing and etc. You dont necessarily have to understand all those concepts inside out but learning piano will give you a better intuitive understanding about all of them. Also if youre interested in music theory its pretty much essential. Thats not to say you HAVE to learn piano you can write songs using only a guitar just fine and I have friends who do so.

Some old German man was my professor. He goes around taking attendance making a little comment for every person. Mind you Im Asian. Chinese to be specific. So he gets to me and his comment was word for word I bet youre good at math. And I was kind of taken aback considering I havent heard that one in a while but not from an adult who is in charge of teaching me. I kind of shrinked back in my seat and barely squeaked out No..

I always do my homework and stuff always break my ass to put in effort but i always flub something and always lose marks.
