4094316,0,t1_crlx9cf,The key issue for me was that the for side never really coordinated their messages. Instead of there being a single organisation running the for campaign there were several parties and groups ERS UKIP Lib Dems etc. and they largely refused to cooperate. Another part of the issue was that the alternative proposed  AV  was the result of a botched coalition compromise. The for side didnt really want it they preferred PR etc. and the arguments were a bit uninspired as a result.The against side organised their publicity much more effectively. There were some infamous posters saying stuff like this dying infant needs a maternity ward not a new voting system they stated that getting rid of FPTP would cost ten times more than it actually would and they had the support of almost all the major politicians.If a referendum were to occur now it would go much better. People are really starting to understand the issues more than ever before. Unfortunately with a Tory majority its never going to happen. Im about as antiFPTP as they come and even Ive basically given up hope.,TeamItUp,crmz74n,3,t5_31rqq
