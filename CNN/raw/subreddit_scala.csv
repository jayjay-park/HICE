983167,0,t1_chg05rz,Well... I think weve already been over most of what the class needs...A bunch of operators like  which implement AAgtA which are also mostly commutative and associative...In addition besides the base class operations which us to  these things we will have stuff like InTypegtOutType OutTypegtInType.We will have a chain of these buggers in a class which contains an HList member or extends HList s.t. the OutType of en  inType of en where the container class also implements the matrix ops  etc... thats what the zipmap thing is about ... so the container class shares the baseclass of its elements... and thus could be constructed recursively. The Class which contains the HList will thus have InTypeHList.head.InType and OutType  HList.last.OutType...  Im not exactly clear on what monads are but from what I know the entire datastructure composed of these elements implementing a chain of operations sort of resembles one... so its like maybe? a chimeric multiple operations monoid which is also a monad? A chain of functions with parameters which can be transformed in a binary operation with the parameter of a function of the same type... I guess.Its a neat concept... And I have an implementation mostly working with the typeclass advice you gave above... in the future I will probably extend HList to have a Cons which requires the InType OutType constraint... but right now I just have a Require statement in the constructor. In the past I have tried to implement this thing using recursive function composition but the binary op part was really confusing... the HList sort of abstracts that for me.,scala,chg1llt,1,t5_2qh37

The moreorless mandatory build.properties file contains the one line sbt.versionwhatever.you.want and nothing else. The build.sbt can be responsible for defining the build. It resides in the root directory of your project You can also define the complete build in .scalafiles. These files will then have to reside inside the projectfolder .sbtfiles in the project folder declare the projectproject yes essentially they are used for loading sbtplugins like Scala.jsI find the .sbtDSL confusing at best. The idea is basically to assign values to predefined taskkeys either as literal values or by pulling values out of other tasks or buildtime constants.Until recently sbt .. you were for whatever reason forced to separate each of these build statements with a newline only in .sbtfiles mind you. Sbt boasts about how it uses Scala for its build definitions so Ive always found this behaviour strange since Scala itself doesnt have this issue with blank lines or lack thereof.In short the build is spread out over several files and directories.

3125931,0,t1_colfyji,gt Thats exactly what List and Stream already are facades the only other option is to use a View which neither copies nor memoizes but is not immutable in any way. What would writing your own possibly do that these three dont do already?The OP is apparently working on a numerical application involving operations on a large number of highdimensionality vectors. Nowadays this kind of computation is mostly memory bound. That is to say the CPUs crunch numbers faster than they can access memory. To alleviate this bottleneck CPU have a caching mechanism when they load a value from memory they also load in the cache all adjacent data in the hope that the data is structured in memory in the same way as they are accessed in the computation.Now List and Stream are implemented as cells containing a single value and pointing through a reference to the next element. Thus elements are spread across the heap. On the other hand arrays stores elements in an contiguous order. When you access to the first element the next entries will be preloaded in the CPU caches for computation hence a huge speedup.A good primer is found here I could use an view on an array but they are not specialized. That will imply boxing... If you need numerical performances most of time you will need to replace the most inner loop with an handcrafted solution implying dedicated datastructures. Of course generic solutions are better for the  rest of the code.,scala,com023r,3,t5_2qh37

4704103,0,t1_ctml1ky,Scala.js does use a DCE which while being conservative does a great job in reducing a lot of code. Personally my typical applications are outputted around kb in size which is acceptableThe DCE works best when all of your code reuses as much of the same library as possible hence why I am recoding the Java collections to use Scala because the clear majority of Scala developers do use Scala collections. In regards to SodaTime the first pass I am going to do is to just use Scala collections then I want to see if the business logic actually works fine and then I will consider changing all mutable collections to immutable onesAs an example with the following code     object ScalaJSExample extends js.JSApp      def main Unit          List.map            The fully optimized output for that specific section is there is of course the runtime ontop of this    Jg.prototype.main  function       c      var a  new C.ha           b  c.oa        a  Qea b        b  c.oa      if b  c.oa         if a ! F          for b  a.K b  Nenew Oe A b |  F a  a.r a ! F var c  a.K            c  Nenew Oe A c |  F            b  b.Od  c            a  a.r       else         for b  Tea b !a.i c  a.K b.hbA c |  a  a.r        b.bb          As you can see in terms of speed it would be fairly similar to the use of Scala collections i.e. just like Scala collections the Scala.js version does use CBF and it does build intermediate objects to do that mapIf Scala.js were to use something like this  than I suppose it would be faster until it at least gets JITed most modern javascript VMs do JITing similar to JVM the difference is that pre JITed code is more of a concern on Javascript than it is on server side JVMIn regards to output size the full size of the example I just wrote is kb and thats because Scala.js had to output the runtime for all the collections library. However if you were to add another thousand of lines of code which just uses standard collections  standard scala stuff it wouldnt add that much more code to the final output hence why I want the Javascript version to use as much idiomatic Scala libraries as possibleEDIT there is a fantastic online tool  that lets you write Scala and shows you the output of Scala.js code you can see the commands here  which allows you to show what the fully optimized output is,scala,ctnhmyb,2,t5_2qh37

6758739,0,t1_d0gsghw,gt Think about the true nature of OOP ... polymorphismsomething like generic programmingOOPs true nature is subtyping or in other words a form of ad hoc polymorphism Everything else is secondary. For one dont mistake ad hoc polymorphism with parametric polymorphism generics. The two notions are fairly orthogonal albeit complementary in practice.gt inheritanceproblematicBecause of inheritance in Scala you can have a MonadError typeclass inheriting from theMonad typeclass inheriting from the Applicative typeclass inheriting from the Apply typeclass.So in Scala when creating such typeclass instances you dont have duplicate operations laws and tests for Applicative versus Monad this versus Haskell. Because of OOP being used for implementing typeclasses in combination with implicit parameters in Scala typeclass instances are actual values instead of being special things with special treatment. And because we are dealing with values that are passed around as function arguments we can also override a default typeclass instance in a certain lexical scope.  Again compared with Haskell where typeclass instances are not values but special things with special treatment and for a typeclass you can have a single definition per type per project. For this reason Haskells typeclasses are kind of antimodular. This isnt to say that usage of typeclasses in Scala isnt problematic at all. There are problems but the tradoffs you end up making versus Haskell are interesting to say the least Also in Scala again by means of OOP inheritance and type members we can have abstract modules like in SML except that in Scala because of OOP module instances are ... tam tam ... values. Which again its cool because you can pass these around as arguments to functions. This is the famous Cake Pattern actually. Pretty cool except people use it as a poors man dependency injection mechanism and do it poorly and I personally recommend against it but its a showcase of what OOP makes possible.There are also some cool effects of OOP and subtyping. For example in Scala a Set is also a function returning a Boolean. Pretty cool if you think how in mathematics sets can be characterized by functions.  And as you can see compared with languages like Ocaml in Scala you dont have two typesystems in the same language which is horrible in Ocaml because they dont mix well. Turtles all the way down man gt the encapsulation is a good featureWell yes and no. Encapsulation is good for libraries to choose which API is exposed and supported and which isnt. On the other hand encapsulation isnt so needed for pure functions and immutable datastructures because you no longer have a mutable internal state that you can easily break by mistake. Encapsulation is also NOT a special property of OOP because you can achieve the same effect just with closures. Though dont get me wrong encapsulation is useful.gt oop is a failure in practice because it failed to describe a proper type systemI personally cant parse that.

7428708,0,t1_d2me4l1,Im not really keen on the casting approach as an escape hatch. It feels like much more of a code smell than simply having a partial function. Renaming to unsafeGet would seem more practical to me. Plus you can use WartRemover to hard fail on any calls to .get unless youve explicitly annotated a block of code as unsafe. Which means it turns up very quickly in code review and will get the banhammer of rejection unless theres a very good explanation why we have an unsafe block.As an example of where I might decide to cheat and use it  lets say I have a Record with  fields on it  of which are optional. I have a function that does something with this record if all the fields are set and runs a simpler version of the logic otherwise.This function itself is broken up into smaller partial functions that do different parts of the logic all of which need the whole record and none of which can function without.Since weve checked the precondition in the public function and all the other functions are private we can be confident that even though they are partial theyll never be passed a value they cant process. Its entirely possible to make a mistake here a the compiler wont catch it but if we do make such a mistake our application will fail hard and fast as soon as we boot it up so it wont go unnoticedBeing good FP cultists we decide partial functions are bad and these inner functions should be total. Do wea Instead of taking a record that could fail take ten parameters without the optional wrapper guaranteeing we can only be called with correct values. This adds a lot of boilerplate since were now plumbing around a lot more values but at least the function is total! Nevermind the fact that all our parameters are all strings and we could easily get them in the wrong order which the compiler wont do anything about unless we also start throwing newtypes everywhere.b Create a second version of the model that doesnt have optional fields for use in this area. We can now pass this around safely but it means we have to create another model for every variation needed to satisfy totality for one function or another.c Accept that Scala and the JVM And Haskell for that matter are so far from guaranteeing totality anyway and that while its best to try and leverage type safety as much as possible our application code isnt exactly formally verified to begin with and pretending we can get even close to true totality on this stack is like trying to sail the ocean in a cheese grater. Instead of blindly assuming maximum type safety is always the way we realise thats its actually a tradeoff between one suboptimal choice and another suboptimal choice.With this in mind we decide to focus on ensuring correctness as much as possible through this code path. Acknowledging that a type checker is just a form of linter and is one of many types of correctness verification we can do on this code path we consider our options and decide that running QuickCheck over this code is the most elegant solution and lets us validate with reasonable certainty that even though some of the private functions are partial the public function is total for all possible values without overcomplicating the underlying code itself. The result is easier to maintain less prone to several other types of bugs and were just as confident its correct and safe.Now please understand Im not advocating TDD instead of Types or anything ridiculous like that simply pointing out that that genuinely are rare scenarios where tests may be a better choice.,scala,d2mlhn2,1,t5_2qh37

One is to copy and paste other people source code and then throw out binaries under a BSD license this is what the guy did when the project was still on Google Code.Its ok we can all make mistakes. So I tried to talk to him on the mailing list of Scalalab. He was unregenerate and refused to accept that he cannot simply copy code modify it and release under a new license. The LGPL clearly states that you can release derivate works under a compatible license. Its not that my library is super duper extensive or particularly original but there was a genuine disregard for intellectual work which is the more concerning giving that this guy works in academia and wants to build a tool for academia. I just submitted a grant application and had to fill out an entire sheet detailing how I plan to ensure compliance with European ethics in science standards going to the length of dealing with plagiarism misattribution of intellectual work etc. You simply cannot take the stance of this guy in academia its very wrong. Also the whole action had the flavour of vandalism basically we was looking around for all the bits and pieces he thought should go into Scalalab and pasted them all together in the source directories. Not a single license is mentioned or reproduced.

9188308,0,t1_d8gnybn,Im still very new to the language myself but I have been developing for over a decade in various languages of all flavors. Even so Id be lying if I said that I havent felt the learning curve of Scala.Part of it is the language itself but that was the easiest part to overcome. Scala for the Impatient and then the rd edition of Programming in Scala really made the language itself clear for basic usage. I still find myself getting hung up on the type system when it comes to doing advanced typelevel programming. The type system is one of the things that drew me to Scala however  being able to model things so expressively. So Ive enjoyed it despite the challenge.However the thing that has made using the language to work on a project not an advanced library somewhat difficult is as you allude to the lack of cohesive direction. There are so many ways to do things that sometimes Im at a loss as to what the upsides and downsides are in practice of one direction vs the others. Most of the time this is librarylevel rather than the language itself.To illustrate todays example is me trying to decide if there is an appreciable difference between using a pool of Akka actors to handle a blocking process concurrently configured to run in a thread pool sized the same as the pool size or using a single actor and a Future configured to run in an execution context with an appropriately sized thread pool. I like the configuration of the actor approach more since it is in a single place but the Future seems to make more idiomatic sense. But is there an actual difference in practice?

You can use var if it makes sense especially high perf scenarios. If you only use it when its declared in a function its still thread safe since its stack allocated and not heap allocated. In general vars are frowned on and you very very rarely need to use them,scala,db9y0eq,1,t5_2qh37

10125113,0,t1_dbrakcj,I dont consider those worth it. If I can go to the trouble of thinking up a general property I can probably also encode that property in the type system and then I wont bother with a unit test at all. The cases where I test are precisely the cases where I cant figure out or be bothered with the generalization and just want to sanitycheck with a couple of examples.,scala,dbrb489,1,t5_2qh37
10197284,0,t1_dbzjtnv,Indeed using more granular types would be the way to go. I used the Name type as an example of this. Enforcing invariants for the date range and the name would eliminate the requirement for having to use a invariant validating constructor for the Conference type. I focused more on making a point about using types to express invariant validation failures rather than exceptions although I probably should have also included the date range example for the sake of completeness.,scala,dbzx2wj,2,t5_2qh37

10520342,0,t1_dd053ko,Do you mean like having a main entity  Personid Int name String measurements Measurements  where Measurements type would be another case class  Measurementsheight weight  and have this measurements field to be serialized to a BLOB? If this is what you meant then I think this should be done at the table definition level like any other regular field.If on the other hand you meant to serialize the whole Person class the I dont see the model where this could fit since the entity has fields which in turn are the ones that are mapped to columns.,scala,dd0lers,1,t5_2qh37

10842521,0,t1_ddya25s,gt I dont know how prevalent its usage is but Scalaz does indeed seem to have its own version of Option??Optional isnt a replacement for Option. Its an abstraction over many higherkinded types that might have a valueOption included.Thats so patent from description and signature I cant help but think youre attempting to intentionally mislead.gt And the  vs using the already builtin Either type was precisely what Im referring to. Yes cats invented its own Either type Xor but came to their senses last year pIts just a lot more comfortable to reuse Scalas own types in your code because you know theyre not going away anytime soon. Cat simply adds some sugar ontop of the plain old either.That said I fully understand why Scalaz and Cats made a better either in the first place but now that . fixed Either it makes sense to just use that.Im not sure your contradictions here warrant a response youve made my argument for me.,scala,ddybvj1,4,t5_2qh37

11069533,0,t3_5y06lb,Im under the impression that implicit conversions are mostly useful in interop situations interop with Java libraries scalanative scalajs etc. And this is because the constructs in those scenarios are not as powerful. For example nscalatime has implicit conversions because the base types cannot be extended except through kludgy inheritance. However a library written in scala is more likely to use better abstractions that have easieryetsafer extensibility. If Im not mischaracterizing then wouldnt this be a question of whether or not the future of scala depends on interoperability? How much do javajavascriptC libraries infect the average scala program? As a tangent is there any semantic difference between implicit def  class and implicit class? ,scala,dempz2d,1,t5_2qh37
