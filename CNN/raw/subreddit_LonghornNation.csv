981886,0,t3_25ajws,I generally like ScipioTexs work but I dont like this one. It bothers me for a couple of reasons. We only had a couple of seniors coming out. More of the teams talent is in the younger classes and we just didnt have the kind of year that brings Juniors and redshirt Sophomores into the draft.. This will look pretty silly when Jackson Jeffcoat Mike Davis and and Carrington Byndom all make teams and contribute. I predict at least one of them will become a starter and another will be a quality backup. Im betting the odd man out is Davis. Anyway what this will mean is that teams should have drafted at least a couple of these guys so the whole argument is dumb. Yes Mack Brown didnt maximize talent over the last few years. But the NFL draft isnt related to that and if you think it is then remember how many shitty coaches weve had since  and remember that every one of those years weve had players drafted. We should have this year too.,LonghornNation,chfwctf,3,t5_2xoqa

1833873,0,t3_2fko6m,Its gonna be a drag out fight for sure. My hope is we take the ball on O first. Let Swoopes get in right off the bat instead of waiting on the sideline for too long get loose maybe get tackled get the jitters out. Put together at least a decent drive. Then let the D go to work. I expect to run the ball a lot with PAs and boots to move Swoopes out of the pocket and give him a chance with that canon arm. Hes going to extend some drives with his feet. But hes going to have to make some intermediate throws to Harris and Ship. I expect the OLine to be shakey all game. I expect Vance to dial up some great defensive schemes to keep Hill in the pocket. Crashing the ends and having linebackers take out the outside runners on the zone reads. Hill will have to beat us with his arm. Our secondary is much improved. Especially in the tackling department. Im hoping for some picks and some recovered fumbles for a couple good field position opportunities. Last year they gave up  yards to us regardless of our horrible our defense played. Last week they gave up  yards to UCONN who is just plain awful. We will be able to move the ball on them. We will be able to contain theyre QB. Texas  BYU ,LonghornNation,cka6cxf,12,t5_2xoqa

2370394,0,t3_2mivy0,Looks like no one is showing up here so Ill give a quick recap.Texas is long talented and deep. They started out extremely strong and a quarter of the way through the game had a  lead. After getting up  the Horns started to play a little sloppy but Barnes was nice and didnt pull anyone out. Texas didnt dominate the second half but still played an excellent game against an overmatched opponent.Lammert looked great. He hit a  that didnt count because of a foul and was phenomenal distributing the ball with  assists.Holmes looks disinterested out there but that may just be because he makes it look so easy. He put up  and  without missing a shot.Ridley was solid similar to his great performance last season.Taylor looked great. He is the quickest player on the floor and his outside shot looks better than last year.Holland seems like his game has improved enough on the offensive end to play a big role this year.Ibeh is still an athletic freak. He isnt a closer with his free throw deficiencies but he will be great for  min a game.Turner is everything he was billed to be and more. He takes what the defense gives him and doesnt make many mistakes. He finished with  pts  reb and  blocks!!!Barnett plays with confidence and skill. He may be a freshman but he will be an xfactor in at least one big game this year.The rest of the guards Felix Yancy and Croaker all played well but beyond Felix their minutes may depend on Barnes sitting players rather than earning playing time. Felix is a good backup PG with a solid outside stroke. Yancy has a budding way game. Croaker is an athlete that can shoot but may be the odd man out.,LonghornNation,cm4otig,8,t5_2xoqa

8328392,0,t1_d5ijric,Well there should be a sale for ND fans from their ticket allotment but you would have to go through ND for that and they probably have already done it and I am sure those are prioritized for seasons ticket holders etc. I think for tickets your best option will be to buy second hand from stubhub looking now there are good number of listings on there or whatever. I would be surprised if there are any tickets left for a general sale for this game. Last year there were plenty of games you could walk up on gameday and buy tickets from the ticket box but not for this one I would think.Season tickets have not yet gone out as far as I know but I think they probably will soon EDIT They mail out at beginning of August. After that you should see more show up online for purchase I would wait a bit until that happens because the people selling will have the actual tickets in hand at that point seems safer as well as parking passes and all that. I heard about one ND fan that bought a season ticket package just to guarantee tickets to this game I think thats going a bit far LOL.The other option is to stroll up on gameday and look for a scalper.

8873830,0,t3_51s1gi,Im expecting the offense to take a step back. That ND win took a whole hell of a lot of effort to pull off. Guys are banged up on the OLine. It will be imperative to get a sizable lead so we can primarily play freshmen on the lines. Mostly to give our starters some much needed rest but also to get the younger guys enough reps to be playing consistent football as the season goes on. Its kind of hard not to let a win like that go to players heads. Prime time win over a top ten team who embarrassed you last season. Everyone basically saying this was a loss. We score  on em and jump to  after being unranked. Thats quite a bit of good juju being passed around. Even though ND is probably the best allaround team well face all year it still showed our D is not where it needs to be. I was expecting a benddontbreak mentality and thats exactly what we showed all game. That lead to an epic comeback yet we still made the crucial stops down the stretch. I had this game penciled in as a W. But I think UTEP and Cal for that matter will offer some good tests to see where we are. ,LonghornNation,d7eicfl,3,t5_2xoqa

9025915,0,t1_d7w90jm,I dont think calling the firezone play in the red zone is a terrible call. The biggest problem IMO was when we were running the zone blitzes they were pretty poorly disguised. I havent watched the game again but I remember being able to see pretty clearly where the pressure was coming going to come from and if I can see it than the QB can see both it and where he is going to throw. With the fire zones and zone blitzes in general at least in my untrained opinion it is important to keep the QB uncomfortable with where the pressure is coming from. It is also nice to disguise coverages regularly. We did this extremely well in Strongs first two years. the Bryce Petty head spinning quote comes to mind. We arent as good at that yet this year though it is still early and every year with Strong the defense has usually become at least solid by the end of the year. Haines and Hall arent play makers athletically but Haines has shown that he can be pretty good at playing that center fielder role and getting  or  interceptions a season from it. Elliott is a play maker though and would be really good if Strong let him fill into that head hunter role. I always thought the same as yall did about Hall. He doesnt have the legs for pass coverage but has made big plays in rush defense his entire career here. My biggest coaching thing is Elliotts lack of time on the field. He looks really good at safety but he just is on the sidelines. I understand wanting to give Brandon Jones some time before throwing him out there but Elliott has time and its clear we need his speed and athleticism on the field because Haines Hall and Vaccaro just arent really cutting it. I dont agree that just the outside corners were poor. On the wheel route vs Man coverage it is the job of the nickel imo to either call that switch or run with their guy. Locke or Bonney whoever is manning that spot needs to be able to recognize if their communication isnt going through and keep with their guy. Last season we moved Duke inside IIRC and it helped out a lot. Then we moved him to Safety and he was pretty good there too. I wonder if losing Duke was a bigger loss than we anticipated. I agree that Davante going down was huge though. You just cant replace his length and athleticism. If were going to think up solutions what about moving Hill to nickel? He is a good mancorner and seems to have the football smarts. He also isnt a minus athlete for that DB position like Bonney and Locke seem to be? Having your nickel a step slow will kill this team against passheavy offenses. Quandre Earl Thomas and Aaron Williams were so good here playing that spot. I think we need to think about moving one of our better cover corners there or going allor nothing with Brandon Jones like you suggested in the episode.  edit did some grammar and syntax cleaning. ,LonghornNation,d7wrumd,3,t5_2xoqa

Part of that generalization implies that UT fans are not passionate enough about our team and we certainly wouldnt care enough to disparage other supporters.  I have spoken with numerous traveling fans after games who told me that they felt welcomed at DKR. Im not sure if thats necessarily a good thing.I went to business school at Texas Tech and that fan base is the polar opposite.  For better or worse.  The fans are passionately behind their team and are not afraid to boo their opponents heckle yell profanities throw things etc.  Ripping down goal posts and tearing up bleachers is a common occurrence.

Hermans record at UH is not any better than Strongs at Louisville. All of this talk of wanting instant success which was impossible with the way Charlie had to tear down the foundation of Macks program should equal wanting a coach who has proven that he can do it at a bigtime level.

Todays loss was tough but consider thatIt was a road game against a good team.His players have had to hear all year and especially Thanksgiving night that Herman was gone.

9778153,0,t3_5f8qb2,I came away impressed. This is the first press conference of Herman Ive ever watched but he seems like a good figurehead for the program. Hes obviously very well spoken and will probably be better at handling the media then Charlie was. Not that Charlie was bad but you got a lot of coach speak name drops and canned answers. Im glad he spoke highly of Charlie and what hes done here. Although I was also impressed with an answer he gave that did not necessarily point to Charlies program in the most positive light. The question was asked about the amount of pressure the players faced in light of not winning games and the possibility of their head coach losing their job. Hermans response to feeling pressure was that its a sign of lack of preparation and selfdoubt which I think was evident in the final games of the season. Our players were not ready to play and a lot of that falls on the coaches.Its been an emotional roller coaster for Herman the past  hours Im sure. And it was evident in the press conference. Pretty sure he had dried tears on his face before he had even made it on stage. He talked about his UH team meeting and how its the hardest thing hes ever done. Then to come into whats presumably his dream job. He wants to be here and as simple as that sounds its important.Also You win with people. Thats the next step for him is getting the right guys in there and its going to be very interestingexciting to see who he brings in. I honestly dont know what to expect. But I think he will have the support to get the guys he needs to get. On a final note Im not buying the picture a lot of the salty fans on rcfb are painting of Tom Herman. He seems genuine he seems like he cares deeply for his players very similar to how CS cared. ,LonghornNation,daidfil,33,t5_2xoqa

The staff at UH was good but they arent the cream of the crop in the college landscape. For the currently open spots RBor TEFB based on who youre listening to WR QB OC DC LB I hope we dont take a single person employed by UH. Stan Drayton coming in at RBCoOC Tim Brewster or Zach Smith coming in for WR and whoever we want to hire as QB should be the best around. The same goes for DC and LBs. I dont want to get Orlando. I think there are better options who have had experienced success week in and week out against the highest level of competition. I dont think familiarity should matter with any of the remaining staff because thats what the first group was for. We have enough people familiar with Herman we should get people familiar with consistent and repeated P coaching success for the remaining positions. ,LonghornNation,daqard2,2,t5_2xoqa

11069192,0,t1_delrv5r,A  scheme can get a good DL pass rush but it requires a really good pass rushing DTMalcom BrownHassan Ridgeway and a strong edgeholding DE on the other side. Also in passing situations the rd linebacker in Charlies scheme was almost always playing as a standup pass rushing end in an overunder front. We almost always had  true DTs and  DE on the field. Against the run it was designed for the defensive linemen to hold the blocks and the linebackers to meet the RB in the hole and make the tackles. I dont know if that was more a Brick Haley coaching thing though or a scheme thing because that first year with Rumph coaching the DL and Malcom being unblock able we got a ton of pressure from our DL and were disruptive in the trenches pretty much every down. One of my problems with Haley even though everyone seemed to love him after  NSD was that our DL never seemed to be looking to blow past their blockers even in pass rushing situationsor any situation really.  It was like they were trying to funnel the ball to areas rather than attack it. That wasnt the case from the Louisville games I saw with Hurtt coaching Strongs DL or when Rumph was coaching the DL here in Strongs first year. ,LonghornNation,demokys,1,t5_2xoqa

11258441,0,t1_df82k3r,I think Foreman really benefitted from the VampS offense. That offense is made for downhill inbetweenthetackles RBs.Im not saying that that offense was the sole reason he was good because he was the best RB on the team a year before and they never used him. But I am saying that the offense helped him have the coming out party he did because of how it played directly into his strength.I know that this new offense will be based around the inside zonepower. The perfect RB for that type of scheme is a guy like Ezekiel Elliott. A guy with a good first step and jump cut ability. I mean honestly you dont want to have to KO people up the middle. Ezekiel Elliott is a master of making DTs miss up front. He doesnt bowl over them. Id say Kirk Johnson fits that role the best right now. Hes got the quickness that can hit the narrow windows up the middle. As long as he doesnt get arm tackled and can make one good cut and not dance at the LOS then he fits what Herman wants to do best. If they use Warren Id expect to see more outside zone which would give him the chance to take a few steps and then cut downhill.But yeah... Warren doesnt have the break away speed that Foreman has. That was the knock on him last season was how fast hed get downhill and hit holes. Foreman hit the holes fast enough and then used his size and speed to get through them and past the second level.,LonghornNation,df84lgy,3,t5_2xoqa
