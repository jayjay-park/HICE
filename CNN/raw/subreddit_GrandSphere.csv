5803553,0,t1_cxek67u,I would like to believe the ticket is a guarantee of a card of that rarity but could be higher. That would make the  ticket similar to purchasing a single rare scout ticket while the  ticket would be similar to the starter tickets that guarantee a  unit but which you could get a  from.,GrandSphere,cxghht1,2,t5_39rd6
6161656,0,t3_3zuj3a,Hey guys general announcement make sure you have space on your friends list if you are trying to add people! It lets you send out a request even if your list is full but people wont be able to accept.,GrandSphere,cyq0m8i,1,t5_39rd6
6248973,0,t3_4163ss,Alright Ill see if I can get into  next time I play.  Would be nice to have even  guaranteed competent player for a change.  The amount of people who suck in raids stupefies me because I dont even expect brilliant gameplay just for people to not idle for the full  seconds and use spheres logically even if not optimally but its a rarity to see even that.,GrandSphere,cyzxvo6,1,t5_39rd6

6665438,0,t1_d08pkj0,Oh yeah the event itself is pretty awesome and its fun to work with the guild! The ranking system just has some holes they should address for next time. A more tournamentlike style system could be cool.,GrandSphere,d08rik4,1,t5_39rd6
8470862,0,t3_4vnlmc,Solid advice so far in this thread. Another option a little more difficult to coordinate is adding people you find trustworthy to your friends list and selecting the friends option when you host to prevent randoms from joining. Obviously youll need to find a way to communicate with these people etc. When Im serious about doing bounties this is one of the most efficient and enjoyable ways to go about doing it. ,GrandSphere,d60ec38,2,t5_39rd6
9522168,0,t3_5b8oet,Ok so I will give you a basic rundown on what you should do to maximize your beginner privilege.First one thing to know. To reset your account just uninstall the app or clear all your app data. As long as your account is not registered it is considered a guest account and you cannot access it after resetting the game files. Put this to your advantage by resetting if you scouted bad units. Another thing to note first  hours gives you x exp and  AP cost for quests as you should know already. Remember YOU WILL NEVER GET THIS CHANCE AGAIN! GRIND YOUR RANKS! GRIND THROUGH THE ENTIRE STORY! Isnt essential but definitely helps. Ranks give you more cost for stronger units. Grinding though story means that you never need to wait for AP to grind until they release new chapters.Finally the scouts. Never do the   gem scout. It is quite obvious that the k gem scout is far better especially with the giant MAX LEVEL UNITS x CHANCE FOR  and stuff. Note that this specific k gem scout gives you max level base units and you should utilize that too.Now how to maximize? Ignore this section if you dont care about maximizing at all or take a few hints from this partThings you have. Free Story Quests. The ability to level up and get AP as neededWhat you need. Resources be it gold or fairies. Good units. If you havent started a new file yet read through this section and find the stuff i mentioned here so you wont waste time finding. Also prepare for alot of grinding. Skip this section if you hate grinding. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.First when you start a new file go to the arena as soon as possible and then to the Normal Arena. This shouldnt be too hard. This is to initialize the enemies so that you will only meet rank  or  enemies until the next session.Now grind some basic levels and when you think your units are strong enough kill one enemy in the Normal Arena and collect the rewards. You should be able to get an Uncharted Map and this is key to your success.THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET UNCHARTED MAPS BEFORE YOUR  HOURS RUN OUT!Now with the uncharted map start the fairy dungeon in event maps and clear the beginner mode. You should be at a level where thats the only thing you can clear. After clearing that you can get an uncharted map One of the stars give you that. Save that for later. Using the first uncharted map clear as many fairy dungeons as possible to upgrade your intial units Lilah and suchWhen you have k gems scout. If you dont get any  reset. If you get a  that doesnt seem good ask in pub. If it really isnt good reset. If you get a  fuck you lol. Now with your strong and max leveled units clear all the story All  chapters before the  beginner bonus runs out! Remember to do Intermediate and Advanced fairy dungeons while leveling.The watches that unlock all daily dungeons are quite common. At least i remember that they are. You can get them from star medals. If you need gold or eggs go there. How to get a decent start without all that stupid minmaxing?StartFarm k gems.Scout.If units not good enough reset. If units good enough continue farming. Luckily units are max leveled so farming isnt hard.Save gems for future. When to use gems.AS covered that. Remember that you can get up to  normal arena battles once every  hours  enemies each time so you need to clear  sessions. Its not hard to win it so just dont be careless.Basically if the EU improves your reward Example Bounty scout for it. EU means event unit or event scout unitIf it doesnt help you get the Event Reward Unit Example Raid avoid scouting. If you dont have enough gems and you dont feel like you can get EU from  scout k gems avoid scoutingIf you dont have k gems or k and it is a Step up scout dont scout You need to do all  steps to reach step  and only then the scout is worthwhile. Go for first  steps if you want tho only  gems for  units.,GrandSphere,d9mt529,3,t5_39rd6

11637749,0,t1_dgew14j,It cost a total of  gems to pull those units.  Even more if you factor in the valentine tickets.  That barely qualifies as lucky.,GrandSphere,dgf5h8j,2,t5_39rd6
11772653,0,t1_dgs0mub,Thanks for that.  I dont know why they hide it now.  I remember that they used to usually automatically give you the end of the story when you logged in or went to one of the usual places or whatnot.,GrandSphere,dgugolu,2,t5_39rd6
