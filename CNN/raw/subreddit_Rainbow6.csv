2281568,0,t3_2lcimn,I support this completely. Im not sure how technically feasible it is but if its possible to do then I would love such a system. It would dramatically increase replay value. I hear you Ghost I politely disagree though. The barricade element will change layout to a certain degree for forcing routes true but there will be certain areas that will tend to be the bottleneck points regardless they will always try to find the most defensive points possible and theres only going to be so many of those points. Say that house map had  rooms in it I have no idea what the actual number is probably  of those rooms will be strong defensive points players will have a tendency to gravitate toward the same  or so of those points.As far as Tangos knowing maps isnt that kind of realistic? You bust into a home and start taking people hostage youre not going to have the layout memorized. I think it is good to have that countdown period before a match begins to allow plenty of time to run around and scout it before the round begins but it looks like they did a good job of implementing that anyway.As for ladder or tourney play I couldnt care less Im not a stat chaser. My one and only priority is how fun is the game not am I ranked  in the world leaderboards. An option like random layout for maps would increase the games replay factor many many times for me as well as those I play with. As for community generated maps I agree but only PC players tend to benefit from that and this game WILL move millions of units on consoles too. Consoles never get the benefit of any user created content rare exception for games like Far Cry  Wish there was a way around that where you could design maps on your PC with a free editor and then upload them to be accessible on Xbox or PlayStation but there isnt. and frankly why not?!,Rainbow6,cltpwmg,2,t5_2t1bl

2783340,0,t1_cnkc3jw,I like the Idea about them not fighting on the ground but what happens when they are last alive? and stuck in there FFP? The Insurgents would have to rush a sniper who most likely is across a street or two and there are police cars out there and the Insurgent team at E only got the MPMAC and a Shotgun so I think it would just be turkey shoot for the  Sniper. Another Idea Lets say a sniper is in his FFP would he be able to move in the house or would he be stuck to his rifle like its a static weapon? If there are multiple houses buildings around could he chose a different house to fire out of?,Rainbow6,cnkgfc8,1,t5_2t1bl

2892182,0,t3_2t6v4z,Ok this is getting good! Perfect leaning and line of sight system paired with a solid recoil implementation. Im getting excited.The smart thing to do would be to put these systems into a small sandbox for us to try out and test and keep it updated to the final product. I think UBI could do with a win here having a game released already with the communities stamp of a approval on its core mechanics.,Rainbow6,cnwuffw,3,t5_2t1bl
2909621,0,t1_cnwf1hm,Glad you liked the video! And for your personal info I discussed this with Andrew Witts the designer who worked on the recoil. He had  goals while creating this feature  being the base tool of mastery for the players and our main reference point to give the players the feeling that they are in control of an elite operator. As for the diamond it allows for diversity in our recoil patterns. Its up to the players to anticipate and control them with the mousestick and bursts.Also asked Adam for his input on this. The gist of it is that a diamond simply allows for more customization. For example if we want a bit of downwards kick midburst sometimes then we can do that. We can also configure it as a triangle or we can raise the side points so that our most extreme horizontal kick isnt purely horizontal.Hope you find this answer satisfying!,Rainbow6,cnytxr3,3,t5_2t1bl

They need to remember that altering levels is never a good idea so many devs try to alter levels that they remake to add their own style or something if youre not going to remake the actual level then just make a new level but if you do want to remake a level then do it right... dont alter it into a different gameplayfeeling than it was because then its not the same level now is it?

Which I dont think this game even will be rated towards which is really weird and tbh I dont think many at all will migrate over to a shooter like this in the first place especially if it just tries to be another copy pasted and casual shooter.CoD and most arcade shooters are dead on PC where you will see the most mature community and most of the R fanbase since we played R so many years ago now and most of them on PC too and some of us grew old DIf they keep going in this direction and ignoring what the true fans want even after promising their going back to the roots  this game will no doubt fail.,Rainbow6,cq0usfj,1,t5_2t1bl

3615934,0,t3_31s3dx,Watching Ubisoft continue to destroy this series is pretty much the same.With that being said I am optimistic because the maps remind me a lot of Rogue spear style maps lots of rooms hiding spots less chokepoints.The firefights also remind me a lot of old school Rogue Spear style chaotic firefights lots of spamming and prefiring quick time to kill. At its peak Rogue Spear multiplayer was actually very tactically grounded using heartbeat sensorsjammerssetup positions.  It became more arcady and twitch oriented when the meta switched to smaller expansion maps and  frags each. It is nice to see the game go back to a more strategic one.   What has always made Rainbow six a good multiplayer game IMO is the quality and variety of the map design.  If they can keep that up I am hopeful.,Rainbow6,cq4fxt1,2,t5_2t1bl

If you enter silently or break stuff away from where they are they will not react. They are not godlike and I look forward to see how silencers enter into this even more since you most often know where the enemy is due to their gunfire or their breching. Lous vs Silent is going to be a huge impact in both PvE and PvP. The MP was also nice. Low Recoil with high rate of fire made it the bane of many of my opponents. ,Rainbow6,ctumn3z,1,t5_2t1bl

I understand it has a huge following because they used to build on it from release to release but now they have changed the feel to something I dont even want to play casually.Its a shame that Siege wont fill my clans need for a Rainbow Six game too though.  It may be more of a thinking mans game than COD but theyve lost so much of the realistic CQB strategies due to making the game more casual and taking out things like working doors planning maps gimping choices from all weaponsgadgets and matching team uniforms that it just doesnt fill that niche anymore between ARMA and COD.

5130801,0,t1_cv4g6j8,Id rather see Free Operators and Paid maps than the other way around. You cant make a competitive game without giving the same tools to everyone. As I said elsewhere if there are paid operators and they suck people who buy them will feel like they got robbed DLC guns in CoD are a good example most of the time they are just gimmicky guns that exist just for the sake of it if they dont suck and are pretty powerful people that dont pay will feel pushed into buying things to have better score Ghost Recon Phantoms had several moments where this happened and it really split the community badly. Theres no winner unless said operators are perfectly balanced and yet there will be unhappy people in this situation.Except cosmetics theres nothing worth paying that I can think of that wont screw up competitive play and League of LegendsCSGODotaSmite understood this very well. ,Rainbow6,cv4gc6j,0,t5_2t1bl

It works by saying you fired your bullet ms ago we rewind time back to then check if the player was where you fired then if yes you got a hit if no then no hit. This makes ms ping and ping the exact same in terms of hit registration.,Rainbow6,cveajc0,0,t5_2t1bl

5212697,0,t1_cve9ofn,yeah they are this is why early on I played matches exclusively hunting them down. when on defend i used them to try and locate there general positions. then when i went on assault i went to the spots i recalled and noticed the white poles with domes on them. and shot them out. Also if you do get spotted any active camera glows red in theory this makes them easier to spot if you look around the room. on the house mission there is one near the garagelower basement entrance. another is in the back garden area near the gazebooutside hut thing. kitchen  nearest to the outside wall. stairwell main lobby  upper left corner of ceiling as you go up them. SAS training house. one is near the school bus another is on the opposite corner near a cop car while the others are all garvitated towards the main stairwell. with only the top floor having on in the back corner of the end of the corridor. the ones in plain sight can be spotted as you hit the main floor.the embassy? stage has one out the main front door on the concrete perimeter fence another one is at the back garage entrance next to the stair well looking at the garage doors.  another is in the entrance lobby right above you as you enter while the last i can remember off the top of my head is in the main central staircase at the top looking at the top floor.I know thats not all of them but they are certainly the most commonly used to spot people by defenders. So when im not in immediate danger and i know they will be used near the end of the match it can make a world of difference from losing because a defender spotted you or winning because they were totally blind to that breach charge you placed while they had their eyes trained on the entrance gaining you the win.,Rainbow6,cvebn2k,1,t5_2t1bl

5274957,0,t3_3n90vw,I somewhat disagree on the customization point. I like the idea of operators because it creates characters people can easily remember and gives these characters special traits.For example now I can tell a teammate over skype I got killed by blitz! and he knows to be careful. Or They likely have a mute so care with drones and where you breach. When someone has specific characters its easy to relate them to specific traits sort of like in mobas where you know what to expect from the enemy team because you know their characters.,Rainbow6,cvlxp2s,2,t5_2t1bl

5284339,0,t1_cvn4leh,Yep! Its a good game but its bloody impossible to tell whos who sometimes because of the large distances lack of scopes on most weapons and the fact that most of the factions dress similarly.Its not that bad when youve got Russia vs Germany but when youre playing a Rising Storm map youve got Americans Japanese Vietnamese... and uh... theres another one... cant remember who at the moment but basically theyre all wearing almost identical helmets so the only way to differentiate between friends and enemies is to get a decently close look at them which is usually deadly.This frustration is compounded by the old slow weaponry youll be using combined with the fact that bullets use physics. You have to predict bullet drop and possibly wind direction not sure about that one in order to land shots.Overall its a pretty epic experience if you can get past the initial frustration caused by the very high learning curve but be prepared to die repeatedly swear frequently and rage quit numerous times.,Rainbow6,cvn4w86,1,t5_2t1bl

5291033,0,t3_3nh1eg,Translation. The points of Drones too quickly find a bomb. At least give a head start in  seconds of the defending side. Ie no time to even make fake respawn that would add some interest to the game. Do not save even the operator mute .. is enough to someone to see at least one opponent as already understood where the bomb is. . defending party would be better off appearing in the beginning of the game at different points in the room or on different floors . The Council added the ability to change the default position of the bomb because it is very bored when only  places to spawn bomb.

If i have no feeling for communicating with my teammates because they annoy me by permatalking sound is ACTUALLY a thing u know? i wont do this. And i generally mute everyone who talks in Teamspeakwhatsoever and forgot to set his mic to push to talk ingame.Sorry for the harsh words but if you guys want to tryhard tactical engagesdefenses i recommend searching  other players who have the same motivation.

5788191,0,t1_cxe5kgu,I just want to chime in on the killcam it had problems since the alpha and it seems to me it still isnt fixed I dont know because I only played ranked in this open beta where it is disabled. So dont base your arguments on what you see on the killcam it is not accurately what happend to both you and the opponent.Yes this is a very important issue where there is hopefully still some room for improvement regarding the netcode. But in my opinion it is really hard to decide the final verdict on this issue in this stage of the game because of the notnormal conditions beta problems with matchmaking resulting in bad ping matchups etc.Also while CSGO is extremely focused on this perfect millisecond reaction and aiming duel between players around corners and choke points Siege adds so many more layers to the winning conditions that I think it is not as game braking as you make it sound. Yes sometimes clutches win you the game or you end up in this corner on duel and therefore netcode issues surely should be minimal! but its much more about outsmarting the opponent than outreacting him if you know what I mean. Instead of always fighting at the same choke points you just surprise your enemy with an unpredicted rope move or a well placed breach charge and its over. I still think you are raising an important issue and Ubisoft should keep optimising!Cheers.,Rainbow6,cxekvdo,10,t5_2t1bl

They have been and are continuously working to improve the game because they want this game to show that. Do you honestly believe developers spend years working on games just because someone orders them to and carry no passion for their work? Its very easy to jump on the hate train and scream white knight. There are multiple perspectives to what going on with this game and all of them have some validity behind them. That being said the dev team behind this game has been incredibly active in there forums on feedback. Their community manager worked around the clock for almost  hours to keep us informed of what was going on with this stress test. There is more to this than indentured servitude to a publisher who hopes to make money.I agree that some of the bugs are a bit alarming so close to launch but considering this isnt even the full build of the game we really can only assume what the launch will entail.

5832024,0,t3_3v0y67,Its a tactical shooter in the spirit of Swat  and such. There isnt many these days its a dying breed. Has been for years. For that reason alone I think its worth it if thats your cup of tea.But not for everyone its not instant gratification game like CoD. I see many people still rush in way too early. Then they cry when others are using the whole  minutes.Hit detection.. havent had that much problem with it like I did in Beta. Dunno maybe luck. Bugs for sure but they will be fixed Im sure.

You can be Gold  and win  in a row and not get Gold  but then you lose one match after you lose  players to disconnect and you drop to Silver . How is rank determined?It is also important to have a ranked ladder system and clan support baked into the game because there are a lot of console players such as myself that want to play competitively and it sucks having to go out to a third party site to organize custom games.

5857409,0,t1_cxne2dt,This is because the guy running in the basement will only make reflective sound that travels up the stairwell. Someone above will make both reflective sound traveling down the stairwell and a direct stomping sound coming from the ceiling above you. Unless they are already in the stairwell itself then the direct noise is gone.To identify up or down based solely on the reflection sound you would need to get the upwards part of the stairwell on one side of you and the downwards part on the opposite side. This will let you discern and connect left and right sounds as up and down.IMO in real life a stairway like that echoes enough that if I were to try the same thing I probably couldnt tell if someone was up or down from a distance. I would have to get close and separate my hearing in a similar way one ear hears up the other ear hears down. Very similar to the situation the game forces you into.In game these types of careful listening scenarios are difficult because bullets and explosions drown out all other sounds. When shit is hitting the fan sound can actually be deceptive like your stairway.TLDR IMO the sound works very similar to how it does in real life this exact scenario is no different. work with the tools provided correlate leftright with updown by positioning yourself properly,Rainbow6,cxnfnup,1,t5_2t1bl

5874993,0,t3_3vo5wm,Best attacker  ThermiteWorst attacker  IQBest defender  BanditWorst defender  Kapkan or PulseExplanationIn skilled play Kapkans traps should never prove to be an obstacle. Pulses HBS is useful but his random callouts make it risky to use as wallhack and theres no easy way to communicate this information to your team.In an ideal world Pulses HBS would work like a metal detector and provide instantaneous beeping feedback audible to all players. Then Pulse could hide behind a bulletproof wall barricade and a teammate could look where hes looking from a different angle listen for the beeping and shoot the enemy that gets detected set off a nitro celltoxic bag etc. Its  a missed opportunity.Thermites ability to breach reinforced wallstrapdoors isnt overpowered since it doesnt destroy the attackdefend balance but it does make him the most important attacker.,Rainbow6,cxpqrjv,3,t5_2t1bl

5876815,0,t3_3vo5wm,Best Attacker  Thermite.  He has a middle of the road Rifle and the best shotgun in the game.  His ability is game changing and required for some maps.  Also Frag Grenades.Worst Attacker  Montagne.  Hes inferior to Blitz in many regards and shields are situational as is.Best Defender Doc.  He is the nd best roamer overall and the best long range roamer in the game.  The P is best defender gun as it is ridiculous at long range and passable up close.  His ability to self rez allows to him to trade favorably with most attackers.  Doc can often end games on kafe and bank within the first  seconds depending on where the attackers spawn.Worse Defender Smoke.  His ability is too situational and while it may buy you time or trap some people it rarely converts into kills.

5880466,0,t3_3vt9wj,Glaz Can shoot through windows on Presidential Plane.Jger  Place device on the floor near castle barricades to increase chances of catching all of the cluster charges.Ashe  Tactic If you have already made entry into objective area and have line of sight into objective room use a breaching round to launch at wall on the other side of the room to conceal your attack angle. Easy distraction that often works unlike breach charges if you hear ashe you know that she has to be present so they often look at the explosion she made.Thatcher  Run with IQ detect clusters of electronics to use EMP on Conversely Run IQ with Thatcher to maximize effectiveness.Tachanka  Set up gun to cover entrances at angles to limit exposure.  Shoot through destructible walls on angles so that you can see through but the attacker coming to the hole will most likely look forward first giving you time to get them.  Set up deployable shield in front of gun if trying to cover long hallways if covering short areas place shield on weak side so you have time to spin around. Run with Jager grenades can knockout shield and gun very easilySmoke  Run with PulseCastle can tell when to detonate smoke grenade behind reinforced doors  could be countered by ashe be carefulMap Specific  There is roof hatch on the back of the plane that provides easy access to the upstairs out of site of all cameras. There are vent holes along the ceiling in the Armory on Hereford that you can throw grenades over into the objective room.Overall  Leave a specific walls unfortified if you want to lull the enemy into a sense of security for where to breach and youll likely know their vector of approach when the time comes. Tear down window barricades that would otherwise leave you vulnerable to Fuzes cluster or that would provide significant advantage to concealing the enemy. This will make enemy movements easier to hear and give you line of sight advantage because they will most likely have to approach from side of the window. Master Bedroom window on house comes to mind for this! Place a nitro cell on castle barricade if there is no mute present and watch for feet at the door blow when enemy is setting breaching charge if you are too far away to kill via shooting the feet. Sometimes can be a necessary sacrifice. Note This tactic is cancelled out by Ashe.Correction It takes  melees to break down castle barricades,Rainbow6,cxqgmjr,4,t5_2t1bl

Dont start up the Queue when you are in an Argument with your GirlfriendWife you have a Dick Size competition with your Buddies on Skype getting screamed at by your Mother because Dinner is ready and you did not show up watching Porn on a second Monitor etc.Many of the so called private leaks could be prevented if the Players would concentrate on the Game they are playing and not discussing private Stuff with a freaking Microphone in front of their Mouth.There are Workarounds for the Problem until it is fixed but if you are too lazy to press your Push to Talk Button once then it seems you have to decide between Rainbow Six and private conversations.,Rainbow6,cxrdn1p,1,t5_2t1bl

If we bring spawn voting to casual then players like you have a place where you can get what you consider to be the full experience of the game in casual despite not being the ranked environment. Whats to stop your squad from deciding you want some easy wins for egos sake and dropping down to casual because it plays fundamentally the same as ranked now? Im not saying you or your friends would do that but Im sure plenty would. By making it less appealing for players who truly do care about their winloss record in all game modes even those that arent publicly disclosed you help thin the playing field of teams who shouldnt be in casual anymore.,Rainbow6,cxrje7j,1,t5_2t1bl

These people have no Idea what it takes to put together a title like this. I think this game is so good despite the problems and I see a great future in the revamped RB. Even I had to get the COD mentality out of my head and slow it down and now I see the true enjoyment in this game and it great! This is just the beginning for this title and we have to give UBI a chance to let it grow and work out the details. It has to be played by the masses over a period of time. I used to play return to castle Wolfenstein and it had several patches and man did it get good. Lots of crazy Bum tightening moments. So please people yes tell the Devs the problems but do it in a way that youre helping being on of the community that want this game to succeed. A year from now this is going to grab people by the balls and drag them in. We are so used to the COD runabout that we are looking for more challenging game and I think we have it. So lets work together and support this UBI is letting us in on the development and it hasnt stopped at the release date. We have lots to look forward to in the coming years.....,Rainbow6,cxrwofp,2,t5_2t1bl

ALL publishers need to pay and invest into the comp scene in order to be listed as a game forDreamhack IEM ESL ONE etc gt its not because some community made the game big in esports gt that happaned only once from what i know and that is CS back in the days when it came out.dont get me wrong here i dont want to kill your intentions you got my Bigest respect but to see competetive play gt UBI has to work on that not you. for now UBI needs to implement core features for comp play and that is spectator  replaysdemos,Rainbow6,cxspq7x,3,t5_2t1bl

Yeah feet being shot at sucks but like I said sledge can take it down in less then a sec. activate the swing move to the door or wall right at impact then move away. But if they can shoot your feet its a fatal funnel anyway so no matter who is breaching theyll get shot.Barricades arent the only thing though.

Make them more worthwhile so players will actually make an effort to do them. Why even have the system in the game if the bonuses are so insignificant and far apart and most players have no interest in actively trying to finish them. Whats the point.The rewards should be inspire players to play operators they dont usually or climb into terrorist hunt when they dont usually etc because the rewards are enticing to them.

I mean did they not go back and look at the old games and see how they played? I really just dont have any words that can express my disappointment and anger how I want to. I was really looking forward to having a minimal HUD and no crosshairs for Ranked games to see how I stand up to others but now fuck it I have no real reason to play ranked. Oh you get a ranking you say??? I dont give a shit about a stupid ranking I just want a challenge playing a game series I have loved for  fucking years. To top it all off I downloaded Vegas  to play again just for the reason of being able to map my face I think thats what I did most in that game and it doesnt even let you do that anymore.

Ive played the game plenty. Hit over level  in both betas. Currently a level  in the actual release. But Ive experienced what youre claiming to be the most common scenario very rarely. Ive been playing Rainbow since I was a child. Ive been waiting years for this game as most have. So when you come in and rant against what I think is one of the most important gunplay elements that puts this game above any other shooter for me a skill that Ive been trying to perfect since before I could drive I cant help but take it personally. ,Rainbow6,cxz64t0,1,t5_2t1bl

Their not saying ranked UI will use the current casual UI but instead changing the UI so that both causal and ranked use the same UI. Personally I think this is a good thing.Having consitant UI means that causal players moving to ranked will have a better experiance moving over. When I got to lvl  and started ranked the amount of times I accidently killed a team mate by not having their outline on the screen at all times.If the UI is the same across the board then people will have nothing new to learn when moving to ranked making having a new player on your team less of a burden.,Rainbow6,cy0unmy,1,t5_2t1bl

5986363,0,t1_cy45re9,So... Thatcher is IQ? I think you made a mistake there. Also think of Glaz like a slug shotgun. You are effective at any range or at least consistent at any range. You dont have to worry about spread and you can shoot through tight gaps where a shotguns would be weaker due to less of the body protruding more easily. Hes also great for peeking in some cases when the first shot can be the last also an argument for shotguns. The difference however is that in this game attackers can choose their ranges unlike many other games like CS in particular. Since there are so many points of entry a defender cannot defend multiple at once and expect them to all be the same range. Glaz breach a point that gives him the longest sight ranges allowing him to snipe at a distance too great for shotguns to be deadly. Simply put Glazs rifle opens up a multitude of possibilities for attackers for dealing with defenders allowing for kills within a time frame a rifle cannot guarantee and at ranges that minimize the danger of enemy weaponry.Dont get me wrong I enjoy using shotguns often more than the alternatives as a defender but dont underestimate the strength of Glazs only gimmick.,Rainbow6,cy4cdfg,1,t5_2t1bl

6043040,0,t1_cybqtjq,lets compare the sound in two different yet competetive games   CounterStrike and Rainbow six.My english is nowhere near the academic levels but ill try to explain.In CS   There is a sort of a twoway system. Lets take for instance the sound Footsteps and the recieving end other player In CS the reciever you will hear the sound from the EXACT location of where it happened. Regardless of where it occured From the other side of the wall bellow or above etc.In R the soud travel is more complex.So lets say the sound occurs in the room adjacent to the corridor and the reciever is standing in the room at the other end of a said corridor. So in theory the reciever will hear the sound coming not from a room but from the corridor Which makes sense.But what we get in practice is that really loud sounds become muffled for no apparent reason or the direction of a sound is completely wrong.At least I experinced this sometimes while playing on a PS dunno about the other platforms.,Rainbow6,cybr204,2,t5_2t1bl

So a guy had hit Doc and got him to low health. I was fucking around with Doc and hit him twice with the shocker before I forced him to go down. If only Docs medic gun wasnt a ticket to immortality I wouldve killed him. Alas he was blind and couldnt hit me for shit so I just followed him the whole match while my team wiped out his. I spent like  shocks on him and hit him  times.After that round was over he yelled at me to stop shocking him and I replied with a clever electricity pun.

As time goes on this game will be a refined psychological chess game by the time players are familiar with the maps and camera spots. Defending and cant see where they spawned? If you find a camera out when you check then you atleast know where they have been and can plan an attack accordingly.

6079248,0,t1_cyg4216,gt I have no idea why they would do that. Because they cant accurately tell you the damage in a single number. It changes depending on walls you shoot through the part of the body you hit which operator you hit  if they have armour and over distance. What they do is assign a value to each one on an arbitrary scale that takes all of these things into account. So if you see a weapon with a higher damage value than another you can assume that gun will generally cause more damage. Its never meant to tell you the actual numerical value because there isnt a single one. Testing is unlikely to be that useful and is very time consuming. What we need is someone to go looking through the game files to find out how its actually calculated. ,Rainbow6,cygh131,3,t5_2t1bl
6079293,0,t3_3yro4t,Kapkhan on defense.  His SMG is awesome amp C heavy armor plus you randomly get trip mine kills which make me laugh for some reason.  Hes a great roamer because it is best to set his trip mines away from the objective because people tend to be less cautious.  Though I have noticed the number of trip mine kills have diminished lately.

6080964,0,t1_cygnfbr,No just no. Sending a packet to everyone informing a part of a wall is deformed is just as expensive as notifying players a certain pickup was picked up. The fact that this is more expensive to calculate on the client side doesnt mean the information required to inform everyone is also suddenly more expensive. Theres nothing in R thats more complex or more expensive in terms of networking. In fact given that modern games tend to do hit detection on the clientside some things have actually become cheaper as games like Quake and UT would do all hit detection on the server side. Rs servers just trust the clients. ,Rainbow6,cygp3hm,1,t5_2t1bl

6098792,0,t3_3z2qpz,I can give you some great tips for defense. Where you put defenses is key. Your whole team will never have enough barricades to get all the walls. I try to set the walls up so that one direction is covered two if possible. Use mute or bandit as nessesary to achieve this. Then I use an natural piece of cover like a desk or a table and set up a shield facing a different direction so you have more cover. Basically you want to make sure you can only be surprised from one or two directions. Once the round starts watch underneath doors for feet if you see them then shoot. Also listen for people outside the windows if a window gets opened watch it as it can result in some easy kills. Otherwise just be mindful that no place is impenetrable you can always be flanked,Rainbow6,cyivcge,4,t5_2t1bl

6121217,0,t1_cylezw5,It totally depends on what gamesbecause theres really few games that actually have ingame achievements like Siege does.Not talking about UPlay or Steamachievements here of coursebecause they are rarely directly implemented into the game like many of the achievements are here on Siege.The few games I do know of are MMOs and obviously CODbecause the achievementsystem have always been awesome on CODgames even though Im mainly aiming at MW and BOPS since I havent enjoyed any of the latter ones.,Rainbow6,cylf36p,2,t5_2t1bl

6122118,0,t3_3zew8o,Yea delay the dlc but release a beta state game. Should have delayed the game. Trust me  operator and a map made months ago wont change the game server problems.  And network people dont design maps or characters so this does not effect that bug.  ,Rainbow6,cylirrd,-7,t5_2t1bl
6122346,0,t1_cylj4cp,Yeah its not for everyone. Though to be honest I dont know that there is anything Ubisoft couldve included that would make it a must have since they dont want to splinter the community. The biggest problem with premium DLC content is that there will always be players who simply cannot or will not put any more money into the game and thus they will be left behind as others pick up every single DLC. Not having a paywall for gameplay content is a great decision in my opinion but it does make it a bit challenging to put together a compelling package for a season pass.Personally I think the season pass makes sense for players who fall into one of two camps or fall into both camps. Players who really enjoy the game but have doubts about their ability to save up the K renown or so every  months to purchase the DLC operators and useful attachments. This is especially true for the first DLC since renown players earn initially goes toward launch operators.. Players who want all skins andor really like the exclusive skins offered to season pass holders. I can take or leave the skins personally but I know some people who want to unlock them all. If you fall into that camp the season pass is necessary and will net you extra renown since you dont need to pay for the DLC operators.,Rainbow6,cyljpeb,2,t5_2t1bl

6125360,0,t1_cylvcu2,But they were not changed before the tournament started they were changed after eMp had a match where the other team didnt set the rules right sure they fucked up but the rules at the time stated that if it happened that a rematch would ensue and if the team who screwed up the rules didnt want to remake the map then they would be DQd.The admin of the ECSTV twitch page literally said and I QUOTE It looks like the admin left out part or miss worded restart is only available in the st half of the map in which none of this is stated in the rule before the tournament started i even linked the damn rule right from the page and then after loading another page the rule was changed.Sure there are problems and sure this stuff happens but the problem herein was that the group that benifited this was the very group running the tournament not to say this would have been any better if this was benifiting another team either. The POINT is when your tournament starts you cannot change the rules or fix the rules because an admin or a team member didnt correctly state what your intention was the rules were written there before the tournament and after the tournament starts you gotta go by them if you wanna change them for the next tournament then go for it knock yourselves out. The problem here was that it was mid match and the rule was changed on everyone end but yours since we all saw the original rules and were to abide by those rules as such.How do we even know that there was a screw up you cant prove that and all it looks like is that you changed the rule to DQ the team for that map im not saying you did this intentionally but i AM saying that this is what everyone else will see.Stand up take responsibility and bring this tournament the due diligence it deserves to have. If you screw something up on your end you cant go back and change it after the tournament has started. That is all I hope you understand the point now.,Rainbow6,cylw1cj,1,t5_2t1bl

6126256,0,t1_cygmpgu,I completely agree this game is a gem just an uncut unpolished one with all the problems. You brought up the sequel... Thinking about that I cant see the sequel being much different from the game now. If you think about it some of the operators are kind of irreplaceable. Youre always going to have someone like Glaz sniper thermite able to breach unbreachable things smoke and kapkan trap guys. It would really just be a reskin unless they have already thought of completely different ideas which would impress me a hell of a lot! Just thought about that since you mentioned the sequel. But this game has so much potential. PS definitely seems to have a majority of the problems because Xbox has gotten so much better though still has some problems for sure. Guys please dont give up on this game it really is amazing. And Ubisoft PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE at least communicate with your community better because we really want this potentially amazing game to succeed. ,Rainbow6,cylzpcc,1,t5_2t1bl

And because of this the higher ranking in your pool didnt really make them a better player. You would get promoted at the middle of your pool.

6145550,0,t3_3zqkcf,Eagle is an idea I have seen on this reddit before and I like the idea of the ability to gain an extra camera that the operator can place wherever they would like to. I believe though it must glow when operated still in order to alert attackers. The other two operators I dont really like the idea of. Sneak seems very underpowered to me especially when compared to the abilities of other operators. Also I think Arsenal just seems like a fancy recruit as the recruits have access to most of the weapons in the game but we know how much they suck because they lack any useful ability.

It is in a way more destructible but the actual destructible environments pertain to putting large holes in a specific wall if a rocketgrenade hits it at a very specific angle. Even if the environmental effects are larger it doesnt take as much computing power to render because its not different every time its the same holes.

But truthfully this probably wont help anyway because its  on picking basement or top floor.  st floor objectives are risky and underplayed.  this is actually one reason why I like kafe dostoyevsky.  the train room is very secure and its on the second floor so actual gameplay can take place on the rd floor.  i think the best way to solve this would be to have more roof breaches or be able to blow up the roof to allow attackers to look through the floor not necessarily drop in.,Rainbow6,cz0w5bx,0,t5_2t1bl

Im playing FPS games competetively for  years im experienced and I know what Im talking about. Hacking in Siege is as hard as paying  for the cheat.I have around k hours in CSGO always been Global Elite. I almost never meet cheaters or if I do in VERY RARE cases and I report them I always get a message few days later ingame that the suspect I reported has been banned because of hacking. So yes Siege is full of hackers on higher ranks and preventing hackers in CSGO with these methods work while Siege is heaven for cheaters nothing stops them. My question?

6283541,0,t1_cz3v1e1,When youre new to ranked yeah maybe people dont care as much. But I challenge you to find someone with gold or above who will happily lose rank and decide to TK throwing away hours upon hours of work. It doesnt happen and certainly not often enough to claim ranked isnt any better than casual. Casual is where people go to play to do stupid shit so TK is always going to be more likely there.Also by at start of round do you mean setup phase? Because you most certainly do get kicked for TK at the very start. Seen it happen a dozen times at least. After that like I said I dont know if the autokick is disabled or not but if it is then I agree the system is easy to exploit if theres just a timer for autokick to be onoff. It should identify more than one TK as no longer accidental and kick  then ban the fucker from playing for an hour and escalate with their stupidity.,Rainbow6,cz3v91d,1,t5_2t1bl

On plane you have no visibility of the attacking team until they get inside. If someone gets killed by a Kapkan trap its fully possible that player never came into contact with a camera at all.For attackers its very possible that your drones wont find all the defenders when you consider roamers andor certain placements of shock wires and jammers and the drones could all just be taken out early enough in the round before youve discovered all the defenders.,Rainbow6,cz5595m,1,t5_2t1bl

It was a v and I wouldnt have done it otherwise.Edit had an epic battle over the hostage in the executive bedroom and I snuck in to grab it through the side room with the  bookshelves while my team kept the enemy busy. Most of my team got wiped and the blitz was the only one holding them off. On my way out I went out the main door and got shocked by some shock wire. Instinctively I dropped the hostage to switch to my main and when I went back to pick it up I was too low to get through the shock wire. Before I shot the battery the hostage went down and I thought the enemy had shot it in the crossfire and didnt bother to try and revive it. Didnt even realize it was the shock wire until the round end killcam. My team congratulated me but we lost the game anyway.

I have plenty of games where I end up with the  score with like  personal kd. However that rarely happens in ranked unless Im grouped up against a lower ranked team.

The weaponsgadgetsspeed they have already offset their armor. Giving them  shots to the head would upset the balance already in place.

Punkbuster on the other hand goes after known cheating programs and I believe generally looks for extra programs that hook into the games.Siege really needs to start using a second tool to check for hacking.

Itd give more valuable to powerful but ultimately expendable units in early game. IQ will be valuable for her powerful weapons and since her ability doesnt bring anything too valuable to the team losing her wont be a big deal like it would be losing thatcher or thermite. Also when it comes to fortified walls as the defenders lose units they have to use more recruits meaning they have less walls to work with so maybe having more counterwall ops isnt as important as we may think? The only problem is if the a team confirms a thermite kill early game so they can go full lockdown the rest of the game. Solution? Dont bring thermite in beginning rounds I guess.

I feel like Eagle will be very tough because there are no over head entrances. so in order for her drone to get in a room it would have to fly under a door. also she would be greatly effected by mute. twitch isnt because it has a stun thing that can zap mutes. and for Blaze I dont think a lot of people would play him because you can get his same effect with a breach charge and a smoke grenade. plus if it has to burn for it bit it gives the enemy team time to back away.

6533355,0,t3_454fbc,Different types of ammo would create a huge problem with balancing with the examples you provided. Slugs and FMJ rounds would be the only things ever picked because for shotguns it would turn them into longrange shot machines which defeats the whole purpose of a shotgun being high risk high reward and assuming they are worth a damn unlike how they act in BF and hollow point rounds would be pointless due to the games reliance on headshots and bullet penetration so the extra penetration from FMJ would always be more desirable to more damage.Different ammo types are great to add customization but in the vast majority of games that have them they are not balanced correctly making some obvious choices or just all different and interesting ammo types are useless. Using BFs shotguns for example slugs and frag rounds are next to useless and flechette dont offer any real difference.,Rainbow6,czv3ncr,1,t5_2t1bl

6547370,0,t3_45b6wa,I am also using a hz monitor. Ive experimented with a few different graphics settings. With Multisample Antialiasing set to Temporal Filtering the game seems to have less input delay. But with Multisample Antialiasing set to Off the game looks smoother even with less FPS. Its strange. I also noticed that FXAA PostProcess Antialiasing comes with a delay of its own. So I usually play with PostProcess Antialiasing set to Off as well as Multisample Antialiasing set to Off. You get a much clearer picture. Temporal Filterings onscreen artifacting can be a distraction for me while seeing enemies far away through windows around tight angles etc. While Temporal Filtering is great for boosting performance its not worth it for me.Also ZoomIn Depth of Field can lower FPS slightly when aiming down sights which in turn causes a very slight input delay so I disable that setting as well.,Rainbow6,czwjv53,1,t5_2t1bl

There were the staircases which connected all the playable floors.It was a very good map from back in the day. If featured in Rainbow Six it would be a truly fun time amp realistic setting. We need some bigger maps amp perhaps longer timers for bigger maps assuming amp hoping well get some.

I was tempted to join it but went for ESL instead as I wasnt sure GB was going to have good enough teams as of yet? So far ranked seems more of a challenge and I end up bumping into most of the ESL teams on there anyhow being in Diamond. For the slow mo its not as much I dont like it more so for the fact your editing equipment isnt actually slowing the frames down to smooth it over between transitions. Its just playing the frames as a slower speed so some bits look really jerky even though it shouldnt? Also Im all for it being played in high speed just so we can see how quick your reaction speed was? I mean if it was a good play why not show it in the real speed and then maybe just slow mo the shot after? Like a replay clip? Either way the gameplay doesnt exactly lend well to it like I understand CoD being put in slow mo due to the fact its a fast pace game but when your slowing down stuff that is already fairly slow pace it takes away from the excitement?

Read up on the system thats in use. Its not perfect and the world acknowledges this but its relatively fair. ELO is all about winning match ups. Not necessarily how good of a shot you are how fast you build what kind of strategy you can lay out etc. TrueSkill which also has a hand in this system is also an interesting read. As far as high ranks vs. low  I get why this would happen if there were say  diamonds and  coppers together but if its straight high ranks vs. straight low ranks getting matched up this I do not understand save for the fact that maybe they are trying to cut down on matchmaking times or its a bug or its part of TrueSkill. Here is what I do know lower ranks matched up against higher ranks stand to gain quite a bit and lose very very little.,Rainbow6,d05vjh6,1,t5_2t1bl

6661741,0,t1_d08c9y4,The advantage Tachanka has is a low recoil high volume of fire weapon that is stationary. Give people bipods and they have a low recoil weapon that is stationary. Fortunately for Tachanka the defenders dont get any high capacity magazine weapons that can really steal his thunder. Unfortunately for Tachanka this isnt RO with hordes of Germans to mow down. The high volume of fire doesnt help too much against multiple points of entry. Whats the use of having that huge magazine size when the enemys coming from different directions including above and behind? You can only point your gun in one direction. Because of this unless the enemy is all coming through the same chokepoint the high volume of fire means nothing. In other words the only functionality Tachankas MG gives him is a low recoil weapon that is stationary.See for the close quarters and v nature of Rainbow  Id much rather have a bipod than a pintle mount MG. For one Bipods are not really stationary. Theres very little deploy time with a bipod. You just walk up to cover and you get the bonus. See a nade? You just leave. With Tachanka you have to go through an animation to let go THEN get out.Okay you say. Make the set up and take down time the same as Tachankas. If thats the case why go tachanka when you can have the same functionality of his MG with any weapon AND have another ability?The other thing is that Tachankas MG takes a while to set up and take down. Plus its super finicky on where you can place it. With a bipod anywhere that covers you when you crouch is fair game. If you count prone thats pretty much everywhere on the map.TLDR Bipods give any other operator the ability to do his role and do it better.,Rainbow6,d08dqh1,1,t5_2t1bl

6703188,0,t3_47fif6,Thanks for continuing to work on making this game as good as possible! Its got so much potential and is already easily one of the best multiplayer FPS games Ive ever played.My biggest complaint in ranked other than some matchmaking woes maybe theyve been fixed by todays patch havent had a chance to try it out for myself is not being able to reliably reconnect to a match. Sometimes my ping spikes and I get booted from the match and cant reconnect. Or the game crashesI get some sort of error and its like  whether Ill get the option or not.Look at how Dota handles it. Its perfect. No matter the reason if you disconnect from a match you get a few minutes to reconnect. If you dont reconnect in that time it counts as an abandon.I cant think of a better way to do it and it would get rid of so much frustration. I couldnt even tell you how many losses Ive got from this. It completely tanked my rank.EDIT After playing a few hours in ranked thank you for the patch! I expected search times to be way higher but theyve been about the same sometimes even significantly quicker and all of the matches have been totally fair.

6706320,0,t3_45frtz,I have posted this twice and there was no response. This glitch has ruined ranked games for my team and also lowers my rank.Bug here. PC player.I had posted this on a different thread but it didnt get much attention. This problem is really screwing my experience especially with Ranked.Sometimes when I join a match and it says Match starting in  I wont load in with everyone else. I will still be at the matchmaking screen while everyone else is in game. If I stay at that screen it will just say Im loading and there is nothing I can do to get in. The match also wont start for anyone else. So I usually have to back out so everyones game can start but it basically makes me leave.Before Patch . I could AltF relaunch and then it would give me an option to reconnect. Now the reconnect prompt doesnt even happen. So I am forced to abandon the match in the first round.,Rainbow6,d0czp64,1,t5_2t1bl

There are lots of good places to put it on most maps and they are almost always off limits to him.  This means you end up placing it in for the most part extremely exposed or extremely obvious and predictable areas.  Because its either that or you dont get to put it down at all.  There ARE a few good spots... like the first floor of Chalet in that corner by the stairs overlooking the whole first floor entries and the second floor railing.  Basically WTF spots so that when you open fire the enemy shits themselves.  They almost always expect him to be ON the objective so if you are out in some randomass nowhere spot it can be quite hilarious.

Sometimes they explode when shot other times they just keep on coming and then explode when I think theyre too far away but I still die.Also did their run speed get a boost? They seem faster than they used to be when theyre sprinting in for the kill.To iterate theyre inconsistent in many ways and theyre hard to kill two qualities I think are out of place in a game like Siege. ,Rainbow6,d0hxyyh,2,t5_2t1bl

6806274,0,t3_48x95d,Its skill based match making my friend. I got burned alive earlier for mentioning the fact that skill based match making is either existent or more rigorous in casual now. Many people agreed that things were much more sweaty now. I carefully explained some of the issues that rigorous SBMM can cause and that Ive seen it wreak havoc on other games. The main reason I mentioned it was because last night I ran pvp all night long with my friend whos new to the game and we played almost all people who were levels . Its pretty unfair for my friend and our team was objectively disadvantaged by it because we had a him who is very skilled for his level but simply doesnt know simple things like how to navigate most maps. He just hit level  something and has had the game half a week. We lost almost every match and almost all of them ended in a heart breaking loss or a hard fought victory even if I lead the team and did amazing. It was very frustrating. Not to mention the matches were so slow that sometimes we would win a round because the attacking team never even approached the objective fast enough. So not only is it totally broken for players in squads with wide level variations but I laid out for a few people that the main criticism of SBMM is typically connection which siege has dedi servers so it may not be as bad but its very noticeable now that you spend a billion years searching and then it comes up with all level s after ten minutes. SBMM if very strict reduces the pool of players you can choose. The top players on destiny would literally search for  minutes to find a match and then when they found it the players would be from around the world and the lag would be intolerable. Go to their sub. Its still a big issue that the community is very bitter about. But youre apparently not allowed to mention any of that here because not a single person really engaged my criticisms and just told me that I wanted to pub stomp people. Which I sucked at this game for a while and just dragged my stats up above positive recently and just started winning the majority of matches to get my winloss and kd over .. My kd is .. I kill . people per life. As typically a solo player and when in not solo Im with two friends who dont even know the maps... But apparently I just want to pub stomp. But if youre curious theres your answer. Its trying to find people exactly on your skill level. Which is why the pool of players to put you with is a lot smaller. Its also the source of a bunch of other issues but dont expect anyone here to engage with those issues. Theyre the same issues that many games have had to struggle with when rigorous SBMM was implemented. The discussions have been laid out before. But we will just witch hunt you for wanting to pub stomp if you say anything. SBMM should be in ranked and connection based match making belongs in casual. Thats afterall the point of casual. ,Rainbow6,d0nsbdy,3,t5_2t1bl

6900856,0,t1_d0yi52y,Eh. Depending on how expensive they are I still think it would be fair. I guess if youre one of those people just stacking tons of renown stuff seems cheap but for people like me or my new friends k renown for the new operators took an eternity to save up for. If the skin packages are comparable in cost the people who paid money for them should be no more angry than people who spent money on the season pass. You paid for much greater accessibility and you got it. If you paid cash for a skin package thats way more accessible than spending weeks or a month saving up renown. The difference is one person was fine waiting a month to save and the other figured they had expendable cash and the cost of waiting all that time was more of a cost than the extra couple bucks they had. I personally dont think a video game should make people who want to spend cash special. If it gives you avenues to accessing things quicker without grind sure.

6918112,0,t3_4ahyd7,the changes to your ranking depend on many things and are different each match. while I agree that after a  kill streak you should start ranking up it could also be that you had very low rank before so it takes some time to get you out of copper.but what is more likely that those  games just dont really add much to your rank because you got matched up against lower ranked players. if you won all those games to silversgolds or even higher then you would for sure be ranked up already. tldr while winloss is the main factor in determining if your rank increases or decreases the amount of which depends also on the levels of your enemies.if this is not the case here I cannot confirm that players are stuck at one rank. since the . patch it became much easier to move through the middle class ranks.,Rainbow6,d10hox5,1,t5_2t1bl

From the standpoint of the consumers us it sounds like a great idea.But form the point of the companies i.e. Microsoft and Sony it means that they lose a bit of the attraction that their respective consoles provide.Like I saw that SW Battlefront as an example has more users online on PS than Xbone so thats something Sony can push. But if they do crossplay Sony loses that advantage and any other similar advantage on other games.Same can apply to Microsoft though so it depends on who has most to lose.

7105248,0,t1_d1lpvx5,In a way I agree but this type of game will inherently get stale overtime so I thinks its good for Ubi to occasionally introduce operators that have the ability to drastically change gameplay.  Now that Ive thought about it a little more an operator like this could serve as a distraction for the defense like almost any of the attackers. As it is now if you hear a barricade going up you know that a defender is standing there contrary to the a barricade being blown up because the attacker could be in the other side of the map. That ability makes the attackers second guess where the defenders are just like when a defender hears or sees a barricade blow up theres theres no reason to suspect the attacker is actually there.  Honestly though the reason I cant see it working is that if that sort of barricade were to drop it would be more of a curtain than a solid barricade. As of now I can buy defenders stashing pneumatic nail guns presumably in their asses and also that theyre usually nailing them to the glass but I cant think of a realistic method that a garage door style barricade unrolls from the header and somehow firmly attaches itself to the opening. ,Rainbow6,d1lr4mi,1,t5_2t1bl

7224293,0,t3_4ecdr4,Imo Ubi not being active aggressively at communicating the actual cheating situation right now plays a big role for the current toxic atmosphere that is poisoning the game. In almost every single match somebody is accusing someone else of cheating. Look at this subreddit its filled with vidsgifs of actual cheatersglitchers and to the same amount with vids that are supposed to show a cheater in action although its obvious that the video is no prove at all.Considering this weird atmosphere of fear and hate and mistrust Id like to see more investment of Ubi in opening to the community addressing these concerns and also showing that theyre really behind the long term success of this game. Because due to the lack of information the lack of actual patching of known problems via hotfixes or other smaller fixes an actual working anticheat that makes the players feel more safe and protected from actual cheating is driving alot of people away. Pro players are just waiting for Overwatch to come out to leave this ship. A good part of my ingame friendslist is just waiting to jump ship as well because right now nobody trusts Ubi to be active and committed enough to this new IP despite it being a beautiful raw gem that needs alot of more care and polishing.,Rainbow6,d1zcjjl,2,t5_2t1bl

7346336,0,t1_d2d6fce,ESL most LANs of late require either the branded Plantronics over ears or the M ear protection to stop players from being able to hear the announcers. It is usually in the rules that players are not allowed to take them off until the match is over or explicitly instructed to by admins. These players are very clearly new to LANs and they are breaking the rules by taking them off. They are seemingly being lenient because of how new they are but it is a problem. You can hear Panky telling the admins to make them put the headsets back on so he can continue talking about strats between rounds. Clearly Panky is the only one there who knows how LANs work in the slightest which is sad considering that is ESLs ONLY JOB.EDIT As for the IEMs some people like the sound profile they are used to rather than adapting to the different sound stage of the Plantronics.,Rainbow6,d2d87ok,10,t5_2t1bl

7347773,0,t1_d2dd5jt,First you stated donated computers not sponsors deals. I was clarifying your earlier post.. I also stated exactly how sponsor deals work but youve ignored that.. then youve tried to attack me and disregard me as a member of the pc master race.Now you are changing your demands. Streaming a p stream is counteractive and actually would encourage teams managers to watch the stream and just tell them what the other team is doing or positions they are playing. p is too low of a resolution to see the screen and player properly. The bandwidth would be used when uploading the footage to ESL servers because otherwise it would have to be stored on the players computer and it becomes useless. Since you suggest streaming you would also need a good processor to stream the webcam footage encode the video  the webcam would have a higher resolution than p and stream it. Which then means u need a good internet connection.Now as for the PS you can only record at Pfps with a secondary device the PS records at P and for only mins on a GB HDD.Keep going you have no idea about eSports at all or even the leagues which would have to implement these absurd ideas.. yeah lets just force our players to stream their games and positions to the other teamsAlso  USD is the prize money makes no difference to the players. It would cost all the teams a minimum of  which they could get nothing back.Again this has to be replicated across ALL PC PRO LEAGUES,Rainbow6,d2de3lb,-2,t5_2t1bl

There is only a newspaper stand to hide behind and an APC but straight out the gate you can easily get headshot and killed it should give you at least a  second invinciblilty shield to get to cover defenders already start out with a couple advantages such as getting preparation time and being able to pick a spot to shoot from ahead of time. The attackers have a good chance if the defenders dont know what theyre doing but when you get into a casual game with  enemies with mics on different windows with one running around outside. Also to put into perspective the running guys morality Ive played with him before he glitched a wall in Bank when you used to be able to do it and I had to team kill him to stop him. Its just not sportsmanship to kill in spawn. Aim out a window yes blatantly run outside no. Its also a different thing if a player is attacking and is the last one so they just waste time. No one wants to be bored videos are supposed to fight boredom so by just laying there they run out time and possibly make the enemy team quit.

If player A adds player B to the ignore list then the system is not allowed to create a match that includes both player A and player B.ampnbspWith the system ensuring that you would never be matched up with the undesirable player again the following problems would be completely resolved The hacking issues The team killing issues The vote kicking issues The exploiting issues The toxic playerbase in generalampnbspGiven the choice would you rather be matched into a game with undesirable players ie the hacks the teamkillers the vote kickers or would you rather have no game at all?ampnbsp How the matchmaking works currently. Select  players from the available pool to create a team. Select  teams from the available pool to create a match. Reserve instance on dedicated server and start the matchampnbsp How does the matchmaking determine a pool?Every single player has an mu variable This applies to both casual and ranked you have a mu for casual and a mu for ranked Every time you complete a match your mu will change points depending on if you winlose and who were opponents wereampnbspWhen you join the queue casualranked the system tries to put you into a team. It tries to match you with other players with the same mu value. Over time the allowable range of mu values will increase. Lets say the range is           ampnbspMu allowed increases over time example    secs     secs      secs       secs    ampnbspMaximum caps were introduced but that doesnt help your queue time it just limits the total number of players that could be in your pool    secs        secs        secs        secs    ampnbspThere could be thousands of players available at  but if you arent allowed to be matched with them you will never be put into a game and literally wait forever.ampnbsp What does pool size determine?The size of your pool determines how many different the combinations the system can put together in order to place you into a game.ampnbspSome simple math to demonstrate the point n    pool size r    how many to select with  available options A B C D select  of them to form a combination n!r!nr!  !!!       combinations. AB. AC. AD. BC. BD. CDampnbspWhen you join the queue to be put into a  man team the number of combinations is affected by the pool size. !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!  ampnbspWhen you have your  man team and try to find an opponent the number of combinations is affected by the pool size. !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!   !!!  ampnbsp How would a ignore list work?The list would apply after the original pool size calculations are made If a player on your list is not online it does nothing since you cant be matched with offline players If a player on your list is online the system would reduce your maximum pool size by one for each player on your list. If your pool would normally have  players but youve put  of them on your list then the system recognises that your pool is only  players.ampnbsp Wouldnt matchmaking times get even worse if everyone has a list?Nope. The lengthy wait times are a result of the system creating a valid pool based on mu      etc. Matchmaking used to be insanely fast because there were no caps and the mu range expanded very quickly. Example old    took  seconds Example new    takes  secondsampnbspThe system is already making calculations based on an ever changing pool size every time a v starts  teams are gone from the pool every time a  man team is formed  players are gone from the pool the longer you have been waiting the higher your priority is in the system to be the next match from the valid combinations Wont people use the lists to gamethesystem and gain rank?Adding people to a list is not something that could be abused to gain rank. If youre not defeating higher ranked teams your gains from winning a match are effectively nonexistent. The number of games you need to actually win for the same gain as defeating a higher ranked team grows significantly. If you ever lose one of those games against a lower ranked team your rating is going to absolutely plummet.ampnbspLets say youre a silver team Defeat Gold team   points Defeat Bronze team   point Lose against Gold team   point Lose against Bronze team   pointsampnbspWould you honestly rather play the Bronze team  times and take on that much more risk?ampnbsp,Rainbow6,d2huiym,0,t5_2t1bl

It can be over in the blink of an eye.If that doesnt qualify as a short TTK I dont know what does.And this is ignoring like you said headshots which are actually pretty common as well.Gunfights dont last all that long. And out of the short to medium time spent in a gunfight half the time youre strafing trying to get an angle ducking behind cover or something other than firing your weapon.

7457791,0,t1_d2pmvs9,Sledge usually just pressures a flank by existing. Often you just keep moving to different angles or open up new ones and eventually the defense is either corralled together or just forced into the open. Hammer plus frags lets you pick apart their defenses without having to shoot. Having great weapons is icing. Shotgun isnt worth it on offense because its greatest use is opening holes see Buck but since you have the superior hole device in your hammer you dont need a shotgun for that. Shotgun is also better when the enemy is forced to come to you. The only time to use it on sledge is when you can guarantee close range fights and you want to aggressively turn corners and hip fire point blank. Sledges weakest point is really his ability to aggressively push into a room but he can still do it better than half the other operators. Sledge is really a super strong all around character which is why hes almost always taken. ,Rainbow6,d2pwjxx,2,t5_2t1bl

7462561,0,t3_4hk2hq,Definitely the toughest trophy was the  successful defends for me but I went for it a few months ago when there were more people on. Besides my following tips maybe try only going for it peak times Friday  Sat nights if youre struggling to succesfully Solo it.I found setting the thunt game type to defence only on house was my best bet and I actually set the location as the master bedroom and used doc with a shield. Id place the shield between the hostage and the big door and sit behind the bed with the couch on it for cover You can also spam penetration kills through the couch this way if you need those. Your main places to worry about are the window and bathroom for flanks. The good thing about Doc is if you get flanked youre OK.My other advice is to try and get even one single person.  person on defence can be tough but it gets WAY easier with two. Check out rsiegeteams or even go check out PSN profiles for people also trying to get the platinum and need someone to work this one with. I really wish Ubi would create a launch now for match making after a certain time so you didnt have to wait for the th person but if you get  stay in the lobby get on your mic thanks the guys ask them to stay on or if it was cool to add as friends for help in the future.Id give you my ID but there are a few big releases coming up so I dont think Ill be playing much other than when my other mates are on for the new operators where we play casual.,Rainbow6,d2qg3q4,1,t5_2t1bl

For anyone with multiple cards do both cards show up in the graphics menu? Heres what mine looks like and the game only displays the one card.

7492299,0,t1_d2trzyf,If Overwatch ships with its current quality it will be superior to R at its peak so far.Ive even felt lag and the compensation felt fair.Blizzard has released a couple of games with rough edges yes but Ubisoft has left games with VERY rough edges.I love R and respect the Devs who made it but somewhere along the way it was rushed or bad decisions were taken. I cant see R taking off competitively. With a few tweaks and MM I can Overwatch becoming competitive instantly.,Rainbow6,d2tu107,24,t5_2t1bl
7493796,0,t1_d2ttqlo,gt I think it would be more fair to compare The Division to Overwatch simply because of the budgets the size of the development team and marketing for both are more comparable.I see the logic here and Id agree with you if we were talking about giving performance evaluations for the developers and project managers on staff.  However as consumers evaluating the product I think its more reasonable to focus on how the game performs and disregard the resourcetooutput ratio.gt In defence of the team here you have to remember that Overwatch is a simpler game than RB It may have a fairly complex meta game but how the game is built is not as intensive.This is imo the best response Siege has against Overwatch.  Regarding hit detection and net code its fair to point out that Sieges design makes small problems glaringly obvious while Overwatchs does a bit more to conceal them lots of AoE longer TKK etc..  However Siege compares very badly to Overwatch outside of actual matches  remember the issues with friends list matchmaking disconnecting. ,Rainbow6,d2u06bk,2,t5_2t1bl

Putting down the visor and all of a sudden his entire helmet is bulletproof makes no sense. His helmet the Maska  is  pretty heavy as helmets come and it gets hot. Plus you cant look straight up in the Maska so going prone and looking forward would be out of the picture. So instead of the visor down idea he should instead only put on the helmet when he gets on the turret.

Just lay down in the corner of the workshop on house. Drone are spawning almost randomly and fefinitly not near the operator spawn location. You can still glitch in vans. With the changing of the speed of operators now vaulting do a weird animation. Its seems that you go through the object you are vaulting on Hit registration is still bad. And I dont think its a netcode problem as it happened a lot during Dreamhack this weekend people kill you but have their head back on the killcam.

7680504,0,t1_d3ew7vv,When I checked BF my statement was correct but I guess during prime time its more skewed. PC gamers are less concentrated in NA that console gamers are. You act like it is such a huge difference when in reality it is not. It does not take x longer to find a match on any platform including the old consoles so long as the player base is even somewhat alive. Just the other day I fired up CoD WaW on the PC and within  seconds I chose a server and hopped into a game.  This is why I made my original point. There are far more games to choose from on PC because it doesnt have generations.  You cant play CoD WaW on the PS. Yet even  years after release it still has a small active population on the PC because it has a server browser and player hosted servers. You cant get that on the console version and as such the game is dead on  and PS. The original point you made was that PC games die faster not that consoles found games faster. This is simply untrue.  With regards to R  because it is such a small team focused game I dont think it needs a server browser to stay alive but it does need some serious polish and support to keep the PC player base interested. There are far too many shooters on the PC that are just as unique for R to live without better support. Just look at this year in addition to the big budget titles that will be on all platforms were getting Battle born Lawbreakers Unreal Tournament etc.  ,Rainbow6,d3f86ni,1,t5_2t1bl

7836545,0,t1_d3wotw4,I have a cousin that works for a major developer as an animator. While he doesnt ever have to deal with things like doors for his job he had to work with physics like that in school. According to him doors especially realistic doors are one of the hardest things to program into a game. And if you look at games that do have working doors The Forest is the only game I can think of right off the bat they act really strange. Basically the only way to have player interactions with them that dont look and act weird is to make them static animations. Meaning that opening doors realistically to clear a room is really labor intensive. Im not saying a company like Ubisoft couldnt do it but the amount of work it would take to make each doorway on a map work properly for all the players involved would take development time away from the rest of the game. Imo I would rather have it the way it is than have them spend all that time on doors and not have enough time to fill the maps with random props to make them feel more real.,Rainbow6,d3ww8f1,4,t5_2t1bl

Its not that bad although this was on console so I didnt get to see how much being able to ADS and pop a round or two off could make a difference in a round.For one on one engagements against a defender who doesnt have c yes youll wreck them. Although I had a few cases where I got knifed while in extended shield mode without doing the glitch through the front of my shield. For most other engagements I got rekt. As long as the defenders have c or a numbers advantage you cant do it. The glitch exposes Montagne for a brief second before he can extend his shield again so a second defender can shoot him while he attempts to melee the first defender.All in all Ubisoft should patch this....BUT I think this should take a backseat compared to more gamebreaking bugs like the van glitch on Consulate.,Rainbow6,d3z64az,1,t5_2t1bl

If you havent upgraded to either the important of doing a custom clean install is extremely important. When you install a new driver dont just keep clicking next. Click the box that says custom. Then on the next screen click full clean install. That fixes more problems than anything else I can think of when it comes to high performance hardware.Ohhhh yes!! Just looked at nvidia settings.

7974481,0,t3_4ogojv,Defenders going outside is not a bad thing and is easily counterable. Look at it this way. Defenders have very littler to gain when going outside as it is. They lose cover they get detected and theyre running out against  people. This also leaves the rest of the team to fight  v  when he runs out. Not to mention the fact that if they die very quickly its a waste of the round for them.The only reason people go outside is to get the jump on someone whos not expecting it which is the other persons fault for not having good enough gamesense to know its coming. If you only get  seconds before detection then for them to shoot you in that time they would have had to break a window or a door that was pretty close by meaning you would have heard it. For them to break a window without you hearing it would mean that they get detected before they get to you which makes it your fault you werent paying attention,Rainbow6,d4ceo9f,4,t5_2t1bl

7980632,0,t3_4ojka8,Smoke commands many options as a defending operator and is probably the most flexible one in all of Siege. Commanding the infamous SMG Smoke is allowed to pick a shotgun as a primary not only as a weapon but also a tool to create long distance murder holes for the pocket sniper. Shotguns also allow defending operators to move up and down the map quickly through hatches creating flanking opportunities causing an objective camping Smoke to sometimes appear behind the attacking team.Smoke has the potential to be a roamer and though some people swear by this I believe he is best played near the objective where he can stall for time and crowd control with his smoke grenades. If you die with  bombs left you were a Rook who didnt drop his armor.Smoke has access to the nitro cell AND his smoke bombs which make him a fun trappy kind of archetype. He synergizes very well with Valkyrie because he can use her cameras to watch his traps from safety without needing line of sight to activate them when its time.Smoke works better on objectives where you can narrow down the choke points to  or  doors so your smokes can be a nuisance.Overall Smoke used to be considered a weak pick until his true potential was realized with the SMG. Without his trusty sidearm he would not be the pick he is today yet he is a solid defender while also not being entirely necessary like Rook or Valkyrie. ,Rainbow6,d4d3jdn,31,t5_2t1bl

Ive done wonders defending a room just by placing a trap on a specific side of a door.

8040515,0,t3_4pawjf,I think there does need to be some elements that separate casual and ranked to give them different experiences. That said I dont think picking your spawn needs to be one of them. Its a real hindrance to never know if youll need to be more worried about defending windows versus trap doors. The operator choices you make can really influence the flow of the game. All too often I hear people say If only I knew we were going to be starting here I would have taken insert operator name here instead!Further more there is some kind of problem with the random selection of defender spawns. It doesnt seem all that random when you get put in the same defender spawn  times in a row and the other team gets put in their same spawn a couple of times back to back too. Sure sometimes it mixes it up but how many times have you played Kafe only to be put in the train room and kitchen over and over or played Hereford Base and it keeps cycling between ground floor and nd floor without picking basement or top floor? These are just examples of course but this kind of thing happens ALL the time.Allow casual defenders to pick their spawns with process of elimination lists just like ranked similarly theres no real reason to not allow attackers to pick separate spawn positions just like ranked too. If not that then at the very VERY least show the defenders what room they will be defending before they pick an operator if you wont let them choose so that they can make an informed decision.As for what differences should be distinct in ranked go back to how it was in the beginning with reduced HUD info where it was more similar to a hardcore mode with less hand holding. Make the renown and XP stakes more distinct too. Theres plenty of other ways to make a distinction between these modes as well I just dont feel that not being able to pick where you start as a defender needs to be one of them.,Rainbow6,d4jtv6h,16,t5_2t1bl

And I know that match avoidance shouldnt happen guys but me and my friends always look out at the other team when we find a match in those  seconds before the match begins. If everyone in your team checks the opposite member in their row you will avoid players with ridiculous KDWL ratios. Our rule is WL higher than . gt RUN. Trust me you want to avoid that.

8106598,0,t1_d4r5ar9,Not OP but it might have been because of the lack of hitscan and bad netcode. Halo Reach not sure about CE all used hitscan where if you fired your gun with your reticle over an enemy you would hit them. Halo  didnt use that and you instead had to lead your shots. If the netcode wasnt so bad it would have been fine leave it to preference. But man the netcode could be a pain in the ass. Your BR had a random spread with its burst sometimes causing you to miss  bullet out of the burst and not land the kill even though you did nothing wrong.Halo  also played a lot slower than Halo  was more floaty and introduced powerups which were probably the inspiration for armor abilities in Halo Reach.Dont get me wrong I loved Halo  when I was younger and when it was in its prime. But after the Master Chief Collection came out Halo  was my least favorite to play because of all of the above reasons even with all of the nostalgia.Edit If youre more interested in the netcode Im sure you can find a more detailed explanation than I what I gave ,Rainbow6,d4r95z6,2,t5_2t1bl

I can just about guarantee you that most players who have played Rainbow on PC for even a reasonable amount of time have squaded up with a player who is or has hacked and is completely unaware.We get accustomed to the videos and being a part of games where one player is so blatantly hacking that if anyone from Ubi watched the game it would take  seconds for them to be punished. However its very naive to think there arent players who use hacks to gain an advantage who dont exploit it in such an obvious manner. If Im using a wall hack and I want to take advantage of the fact that I know where somebody is I could throw a drone out and park it right in the drone hole overlooking their location before I go and pick them off. Provided I am not also using aimbot it will just look like I spotted him on the drone and prefired because I knew where he was.,Rainbow6,d4sffhl,1,t5_2t1bl

8124841,0,t1_d4slip5,Yeah I see what you mean but that would be a fake fix kind of. They could do that and never fix the hit detection and not many people would know. I kind of like how its client side so I can at least tell they shouldve died instead of thinking I am a terrible player. I do want it server side if they fix the hit detection though.To fix the hit detection I think they should do something like this Person w normal ping APerson w  ping BIt should be like this If B shoots A while A on hisher screen is getting into cover the server should compare As position and the bullets position and if on As side he wasnt were Bs bullet hit then it shouldnt hit.Dont know if that was clear or if this type of server is even possible but they need to fix their servers. I have never played on any games servers with as bad of hit detection as Rainbow Six Sieges... I honestly dont know how they fed it up so horribly.,Rainbow6,d4tazs6,1,t5_2t1bl

Telling them its ok to still have the same problems almost a year after release is like saying to a bank I would like a loan sometime in the future but I will start paying my interest now. Thats where my hostility comes from. Not that I dont want the game to suceed or that I think your idea or any new feature is bad but that they have shown they dont seem to want the game to be what it could be it lazy or that they think they have already maximized the sales of it. Seriously the servers today I hadnt seen them that bad since betarelease. It took  minutes to solo queue played one match and then the servers went down.

8159645,0,t3_4r18rf,Also to counter your points First yes you can body shot him but any BB player that exposes enough of his body is just not smart and you only run into this at low golds and below. The whole point of playing as BB is to only expose your head and have someone cover your flank so you can lock down a whole area clear it with relative ease.Second you can disengage but his weapons are so hardhiting you dont often get the chance to go back into cover after you peak. In a game where sound is so important if you hear someone coming down a hallway or rappelling the smart thing to do is quickly peak the player and try to get a quick headhsot or a few bodyshots and stun the person. Since we are trained to go for the head first that is what we aim for and when its BB we dont get a second chance to duck behind cover. Two rounds to the torso with eithe rof his weapons will at least down you. If you are lucky to escape with only one shot you lost more than  health.Third flanking is nice but not always possible. It is easier at the end of a round when there are only a few opponents left but almost all above average teams know the value of a BB like they do the value of a thermite and have people watch their flanks to ensure they stay alive.Fourth I will agree that nitros are a good counter since he is very slow with the shield out but this isnt reliable as it is very difficult to place the nitro perfectly if he is on a window not to mention you are completely SOL if you dont have a nitro. Also this requires you to know it is BB you are peeking. If you peek based on sound then this wont help you. You say this makes him move away from the window if it doesnt kill him but then he goes to peek it again. He knows you are now down a nitro cell and it is very easy to bait people into tossing their nitros like this.There is no need to tint his shield as that wouldnt really be a nerf think of glazs tinted sight and how it can even help when there is a bloom effect. There are two effective ways to nerf him appropriately without making him pointless. Make his shield take half the health it currently does. Right now the only solid counter to BB is the shotgun. As a more accurate and skilled player who doesnt play with shotguns you are SOL as of now. Instead of Rook having to fire a full clip of  rounds into his shield to break it make him only fire  which is fair. If you can land  headshots Im sorry but you deserve the kill and BB deserves to die at that point. Make him flinch when shot. This is already a component for normal shield operators so why not apply it to BB? They made his reload mechanic the same as shield operators voluntary not automatic. When you shoot a shield operator in the shoulder where they hold their pistol they briefly flinch and expose their head for a fraction of a second. If you are accurate enough you can land the headshot. This is what leads to a lot of shield users complaining about BS headshots. If BB flinches ever so slightly to expose a pixel of his head when shot in the shield as they do then that would at least make it possible to counter him while headglitching,Rainbow6,d4xi5bq,18,t5_2t1bl

8248371,0,t1_d58cuma,There was a patch about  months ago which was supposed to address it but I personally found that it made things worse.I dont know if the game is using a specific type of interpolation or if it is an invisible delay between where you see the ingame model vs. where they actually are but hit detection is regularly sketchy.  It seems to favor players with higher latency than those who have very low pings.

8273961,0,t3_4srtbd,DISCLAIMER NOT A HACKER.My guess about these hackers is.... They just have to win no matter what. Be it legit or through hacking. They just cannot take a loss or their world will crumble. I have met cheaters in games like Magic the Gathering and they are scummy individuals. Then there are the Magic players who cannot lose because they are sooooo much better sarcasm. Essentially these people are narcissistic pieces of shit. That rank means so much to them because they want to be looked up upon. . They love to piss people off. They are behind a screen and face no real repercussions to cheating except possibly getting banned. Since Fairfight sucks thats almost negligible. These are the people who love to cause problems for people and the  they spent on the game is worth it for that reason. I can see two types of people who do this. Just assholes in real life or people who are fine face to face but are assholes when they can hide behind a screen. . Then you have the white knighters. Got to love this bunch... I toggled because youre hacking I think youre hacking. I have to say... These guys are probably a combinations in varying degrees of the first two. They look for ANY reason to cheat. There is just noooo waaaay they were outplayed so the opposing team must be hacking. They toggle. Or they are just assholes who use the reason of I think youre hacking to justify their hacking tendencies. Either way fuck these people. All of them. They have no concern for anyone elses fun and rather ruin hundreds to thousands of other individuals experience for their own selfish experience. ,Rainbow6,d5bsy48,3,t5_2t1bl

8348073,0,t3_4tfr6r,Kapkan is my main defender since I started playing well before the buff so heres a few assorted tips to help others trying him out . Dont place it on windows. Not only is your range of placement very limited on windows but it also will always be shot or blown up by a breaching chargeround. Place it as low down as possible on doorways. Generally speaking people will melee the doors rather than place a breaching charge and quite often they will walk straight through the traps. High up on doorways just slows enemies down its still very visible and not worthwhile. It can be used in objective rooms to catch enemies off guard and the traps CANNOT kill a hostage that has not been moved by the enemy team this includes placing it hostage side in the centre room top of Kafe as well as the speedboat basement room on Kanal. Place it at the oblique angle that means an enemy has to wander into an open position to take it out. For example lets say you are defending lockers on Border and you place a trap on the door leading straight to the walkway above the main entrance. If you place it on the left hand side when facing the door the enemy can take it out easily. If it is on the right hand side it will be far harder to deal with it without either pushing closer to a line of sight or wasting a grenade etc to clear it.Other than I guess just try and think about the direction of approach from the enemy team to cause maximum damage. Theres also the consideration of if the round has started i.e. attackers are now spawned in then dont try and place it on exit doorways as youll more than likely get killed.,Rainbow6,d5l28re,1,t5_2t1bl

8544225,0,t1_d692x1k,While technically Twitchs drone wouldnt be immune to jammers it would still have some of the visual distortion I see where youre coming from. About Fuze the pucks I believe go in order from left to right. They would still come out at the same periods of time and still be in the same area so the hostage would still be killed if you placed it near him regardless. Essentially it does the exact same amount of damage but each one explodes in a different place.Also had no idea Tachanka could hit down light armors. Probably because I dont play him enough. Edited the notes and took that out for now thanks for letting me know.And about the Frost traps I dont know about you but as a level  its been a long time since Ive seen someone caught in a trap.

Since my camera is in my chest like you said Im assuming its like csgo where its literally a death sentence to walk around a corner to peek.How does this also apply to proning behind a shield? How do I peek if Im behind a shield since I dont want to be taking the angle? PronegtStandgtProne again? Slowly peek out the leftright side? Dont peek at all and take an angle that makes them have to peek behind my shield while exposing themselves to my buds?and can you elaborate a little bit on Barbed Wire? Right now Im just placing them in the entrances of where I think enemies are coming in not much more thought to it than that. Im not doubting you but why is the closet a bad place for defenders? Is it because Im  holed in the room with nowhere to go and destructable walls on all sides? Not enough cover? Too easily peeked from the window?

8569333,0,t3_4wqluk,People put an emphasis on black eyes up high. I put about half up high and half down low.  A few tips I have generally  Throw them so the enemy cant see them while advancing towards the obj.  Put them in places where the enemy has to pass them before they appear on the camera.  This way people will have to pass the camera and turn around to notice it. dont mark with valk cams. Ever.  Ever ever ever if you do make sure you kill the guy before he spots the camera.  You might think its a distraction. But there will be another round.  There will be another time playing that team.  The number of times Ive come back against the same defense and known exactly where the cameras would be based on finding them before is astonishing.  Then I can deny the enemy Intel without even needing IQ. When you have a good hiding place for the cams hoard it and hide it for as long as humanely possible. I dont find placing cams inside the objective useful.  If theyre inside the obj youve failed IMO.  There are a couple of instances where this might not be strictly true but generally you still want eyes on entrances and funnels outside the objective.  If its bomb and they plant theyll likely cover the defused from outside the room through one of those funnels or entrances.  If its secure area chances are you wont have enough time to check cams or you generally already know roughly where the enemy is in the room anyway.  If its hostage youve already lost usually.  So where do I place? Place your cameras outside the rooms watching the funneling spots.  If its a destructible ceiling put a camera in the room above and get some cheeky wall bangs.    I like a two tiered system in some cases.  I put  cameras in the areas immediately outside some entrances to the obj and then put cams one level further away from that.  Either outside in some cases or maybe down long corridors leading to the adjacent room.  Plane is perfect for monitoring large swathes of the plane with a single camera watching the entire corridor.,Rainbow6,d6cqxag,3,t5_2t1bl

So yesterday we were in a game with our team saw his name passing through and literally lost the first round due to us being not able to play cause we were laughing our heads of xD AaOHeadhunter you will NOT be missed we are glad we kicked you and we hope you will continue to lead your miserable life onward in all awkwardness and shame! ,Rainbow6,d6d1b95,2,t5_2t1bl

8582087,0,t1_d6dz1px,Its just a matter of learning the spots and experimentation. I main Valkyrie for my squad and put cameras outside nearly every round its advantageous to do so. So basically any small map or an objective that has an outer wall. By far the best map Ive found to do this on is Hereford Base. All the trees leaves hold cameras and they are heavily disguised. The NW room on the top floor is the best for this. Two trees out of of each North and West Window. You can get an entire view of those two sides.Chalet is another great map for this as long as you keep the cameras up high. House on the other hand is different. The leaves dont hold the camerasI dont know why. They will pass through and land on the branches giving an obstructed view. You can however still scan through the leaves which basically makes them impossible to spot and is a good way to mess with the attackers and set people up who want to pop out and kill someone. There are many more and people more knowledgeable than me have made plenty of youtube videos detailing sneaky spots. Dont give up on outside cameras they are the single greatest advantage for defenders imo. Especially if you have a team who is accustomed to playing aggressively and looking for peeks.,Rainbow6,d6echcy,1,t5_2t1bl

Thats sick though because it opens both attackers and defenders to using longer sightlines ect.Favela is really the first and only map where you look around the objective and think Wow half of this shit isnt reinforced. But...its the first and only map thats even remotely close to that. Whats wrong with something entirely new?I think most people dont know how to play Favela yet especially the secure area death room at the top of the stairwell. Its a chaotic map but has become one of my tops. Rewards awareness. TIP You and your friends need to bring more deployable shields onto Favela then you ever thought necessary.  House is everyones favorite map because almost everyone can relate. Its a great map and hopefully one day they make more straight up houses with different layouts.

The problem is the change made him easier for everyone else to be more effective with him without having to get good at using the less useful scanner. Before only a few players were really good with pulse so he was never too much of a pain in the ass.Now its every fucking round every fucking game theres some guy getting at least one cheap bastard kill to make him keep picking pulse. Theres a social rule in video games. Irritating things are proportionately linked to the frequency with which you encounter them. Decent pulse players cleaning up every once in a while was fine there were enough bad players getting wrecked while trying him to balance it all out. Now those bad players are having way more success much earlier so pulse is a near permanent concern every damn game. Its irritating. Exactly the same with nitro and shotguns. As they become more prevalent more people get wound up by them. Pulse happens to hit the jackpot of all three things currently annoying people  pulse auto shotty and nitro.

Pengu doesnt know you you joined the TS demanding an invite to his team which were his friends and viewers and then poke him again and again while he was muted leave the TS join on another name and poke him just because you were butthurt.

Yes it has a few bugs but R is always good about fixing shit the community screams about.Finally the game industry only changes through supply and demand. For those of us whove been at this for a very long time we know the deal. Gaming companies with the exception of R no longer care about their communities. What they care about is how many Supply Drops they can sell or how many Camo Packs they can sell before their next big release. R had the potential to be phenomenal but Ubi  in true Ubi form  completely fucked it up. And now theyre spending the least amount of money possible to keep the game on life support till Battlefield  comes out. This game is dead in the water. Its been nine months and those clowns still havent fixed ranked or any of the other game breaking issues that theyve ignored for three quarters of a year now.So you stay put and continue to suck that Ubi shlong.. Keep supporting and pretending this is good. Its because of children like you with no history of gaming that gaming is going to shit.Think Im wrong? This game will dead in a year and you know it.

8727728,0,t3_4z0xbg,gtOverall map and team strategies for attacking amp defending. AttackingSince there are very few ways to flank the enemy clearing out the whole plane isnt necessary.  or  people just have to watch for rotation. Its best to push a bomb from  direction but you have to open up the floor form above to give the enemy limited cover. Thats why I said  people watch rotation so he can watch rotation from the floor above. This is not the case though for Meeting Room but the strategy is quite similar. DefendingYou defenitely want roamers getting some early kills and waste the enemys time is essential in this map. Because with enough players they can push quick and efficient. Because this map is not very roamer friendly dying is not uncommon but you have to make sure you wasted the enemys time andor killed an enemy players.gtSecret areas kill holes and other techniques that can be used on the map.Everyone by now knows about Glaz on the wing to shoot through the windows you can actually shoot even prone targets if you go far enough. The only problem is that youre very vulnerable to enemies and because there are several angles you can get shot from you cant watch all of them therefore Glaz doesnt get used in pro play. A lot of people dont know this but the rd floor is destructible. This can again limit cover and possibly get some early kills. There are some pixel peek places in st floor but they are not so useful so Im not going to go over those.gtThe best operators to use on the map and different abilities that work amp dont work with this map.Ive already talked about Glaz. Other than that because of limited cover and angles in the map capitaos darts both incendiary as smoke can be very useful. As well as grenades smoke frag and actually flash as well. Blackbeard can take out whoever peeks the hallway. Thermite is essential in this map as in almost every map. Barbed wire can stop the enemys tracks so definitely use that. They will have to already waste a grenade or Ash charge. Not to mention having Jgers ADS can stop the rest. Traps can actually be useful as well in this map.gtWhat strategies have you adopted while playing this map? What is something that a new player should know when playing this map or what is something you know that would help a veteran player take that next step?Spawn killing is really important because otherwise attackers have a pretty big advantage. Other than that it just comes to tactic and in casual play to playing very offensive.gtDoes the map offer an unfair advantages to attackers or defenders?It seems like Defenders win most of the time. So Id say that theres definitely an advantage for the Defenders.gtWill Epi ever give us a release date for Bartlett University?Yes gtWhat is your overall opinion of this map?Either people love it either people hate it. In my opinion its more towards loving it but there are maps which I like more but if I had an option between for example Plane and Kafe. Plane wins it at first I was actually very enthousiastic for this map because a few weeks before the release of the game I saw an airsoft video where people as a team had to clear out a plane was pretty cool and stuff.

With an even distribution within the ret this means that the further you go away the less amount of pellets will hit the target.

8737411,0,t1_d6xt6i2,So from what Ive gathered from your response youre upset by the distance from the building that the attackers can watch windows from. I can understand your frustration with this.Firstly this certainly isnt the only map where an attacker can sit far away from the building whilst looking into windows. I can think of many examples in maps like Chalet on the helicopter pad Kanal on the construction site building Club House on the opposite nd floor roof. MOST Siege maps have areas that arent flankable in close proximity. However they are all vulnerable from more than one window as well.Perhaps the map isnt the issue its your strategy for counter play. gt If i want to flank someone outside of house i can usually do that because they are close to the building. Not so on favela attackers usually can hang out way back so they see you coming a mile away.Honestly sitting outside for ths of the match on attack is a boring way to play for both parties. From what Ive read your counter play to this strategy appears to be to flank them by exiting a building in hopes that they are near it. In my opinion the best course of action would be to attack from a window they are not expecting you from that isnt near the objective without leaving the building or to simply hide near the objective and wait for them to enter the building.Again Im having trouble understanding why you specifically dont like Favelas because of this strategy when its equally as boring to play against effectively on many other maps.,Rainbow6,d6xtpy6,1,t5_2t1bl

8754203,0,t1_d6zulz0,I mean considering they release a new Assassins Creed Game every year Considering they are like the third biggest gaming company in the world and have a shit tons of programmers that work for them it shouldnt take nothing less that  months to backtrack what they messed up with the Black ice update. Taking into count that there have been not more that about  big updates over the course of  months having not yet backtracked what messed up everything is bullshit for a company of theyr size. Im no game programmer but i can bet my fucking balls that they have backups for the game and one of those has the release patch meaning installing every little bit of file and test if that was what started the problems should not take more that a couple of weeks. On that They fixed a lot of bugs that you said is the exact same thing as covering a m hole in a wall with a towel and hope noone notices the huge ass hole behind.

8755054,0,t1_d7014gf,No youre misunderstanding what Im saying.You should never balance exclusively for the pros. You should treat the pros as a basis for the balance in an approach that is also accessible to less skilled players. I come from a competitive Smash Bros background a game very simple in its core but still very skill dependent on being at the top. Very few will rise to the top but many can still be good at the game just by developing an understanding of the game without learning many advanced techniques. There have been characters who were way too good or way too bad at the highest level Diddy Kong Bayonetta Meta Knight and were adjusted based off top player feedback not by complicating characters but by tweaking the fine details of them. The result is a very healthy diverse metagame where the skill gap still does exist like it always will but the barrier of entry is actually low. By using the pros as a way to create as vast array of viability any Joe schmo can pick up their favorite character and still do well.Being a pro gamer is the result of holding a vast bank of knowledge and using that knowledge correctly. Why would you not develop around those players?,Rainbow6,d701fq4,12,t5_2t1bl

8756819,0,t1_d6zvufp,I like the OPs idea much better honestly I mean to be put into a down but not out state only after  seconds?!?!? That is just waaayyyy too over kill. I am all down for say  damage per second to defenders outside for say  seconds and if they hit  hp they would go into DBNO it could be shorter but I feel that  seconds is a good time. The  dps would really prevent defenders from doing spawn peeks like garage on Kafe Valley on Border Park Alley on Bank and others that require the defenders to go a distance outside. To maybe even further prevent or at least make defenders REALLY think about going outside the  damage could be applied after  seconds for  seconds at the start of each round. I dont want spawn peeking and rushing to go away because imho it is a tactic which can easily be countered on most maps but I do feel that there should be some riskreward system to going outside for longer periods of time.,Rainbow6,d709ejt,1,t5_2t1bl

I clutched a Blitz ace just last night with only  bullets left and I wasnt exactly reckless with my shooting.

Youre actually right  I dont see too many new videos out there about strats hiding spots defusal plant spots etc. There used to be a ton of them. Theres a new map  so youd think there would be some but there isnt.God Im so sick of spawn peeking complainers. I should be safe outside. Yesterday I spawn peeked and got two people. The next round someone did it to me after I let my guard down. My fault. Oops. I wasnt even mad  despite the fact that he actually rushed outside whereas I peeked a window. He took me out then died. Fair trade. Annoying but keep your guard up and its avoidable.Ive challenged them all countless times. Most of my post history is about these subjects. Sadly Ive watched as the subreddit went from a very tactical competitive shooter to a casual place where everything needed to be dumbed down and easy. Which I get  Sieges popularity has increased which is awesome. But that doesnt mean Siege needs to sacrifice its skill ceiling.Remember when angles were TERRIBLE? Before they changed the camera placement? Youd be staring at a corner and not see anything and then suddenly die because someone could see around it before you could? Or through a window? It was horrible. Then they fixed it and it still happens occasionally but its incredibly rare. The same with the pawn rotation  someone would round a corner and shoot you before it even happened on your screen.Siege is far from perfect. But its great. And getting a  perfect experience for everyone will literally never happen. But as long as the majority of people are getting a good experience that is what counts.

Thats where I see a problem coming up because even with games such as CSGO and DOTA you have randoms queueing to fill up teams so its kind of on the player to make sure they have a good team to play with. It is a team based game in the end and we have to treat it as such. Sure if youre good youll ace your way through the low ranks until you get to your accurate rank but generally having a full team with solid communication is gonna get you a lot farther.

8895412,0,t3_5239v4,I think having a new set of gamemodes where there is no TDM but instead have slightly modified objectives would help. Bomb If the bomb isnt defused you lose. You would only have to place the defuser if there is no one left. Secure Area When time runs out the container releases chemicals which make you take damage is you dont secure it quickly. These chemicals dont kill defenders. Hostage The hostage is injured after time is up and has a very quick health decrease. Must also be extracted.Intel  documents need to be collected that are placed by defenders. This allows defenders to choose obvective locations and attackers get a blend of hostage and bomb in one gamemode. If you dont have  documents after time is up one burns and one minute later you lose. ,Rainbow6,d7h3nve,2,t5_2t1bl

8917582,0,t3_52ew0e,One of my favorite Siege moments was on bank. It was a moment of silence and coordination for both teams. Then total chaos the next.Objective was top floor in the CEO office. We were defending but could hear the attackers in the closet adjacent to our office. So I moved over to meeting room and thought if I should go for a wallbang into the closet or throw a nitro at it. Though before I can decide I notice that  teammates had followed me into the room with similar plans. I deduced that I should definitely go with the nitro.I tossed the Nitro on the wall between the closet and the meeting room and waited. Our  guys took cover wherever they could find. One or two guys simply went prone. We knew the enemy was on the other side of that wall.When we blew out that wall it was the most chaotic moment I had ever seen in siege. Because in an instant  attackers and  defenders suddenly had nothing between them. The attackers were caught completely by surprise and  of them were wiped out instantly. There was no pause in the gunfire. We couldnt see how many there were or where. We all just shot at whatever we could see. Somehow in all this. The two remaining attackers manage to get two of us. Before immediately being taken out by our last  guys.I dont think any other game today couldve pulled off that moment. With that half baked plan turning into a combination of chaos desperation and pure thrill.That said. I love Bank as a map.,Rainbow6,d7jrgvq,92,t5_2t1bl

Plus there will undoubtedly be players who are too scared to roam as much now because they dont want to get blown up by a claymore.

8925474,0,t3_52fqq7,gt There is a lot of hate for the devs on this subI dont hate them Im just critical of their game and in all honesty Ubi needs to have their feet held to the fire for shitty products. Theyve done this time and time and time and time again and its a slap in the face to their fans. I get down voted for saying it all the time but its simply true. Some people here feel the need to praise them for every little piece of good they do whether it be headgear fan service or a minor tweak when in reality theyve not done much to receive praise weve been waiting on some fixes for ages now and as someone who bought the game the day after launch sometimes it feels like a waste of  because for an Online only game the Online part is hardly enjoyable. So do I hate them no. I just think we need to be a little realistic here. If we do not want this series to go to shit like Assassins Creed did we need to keep them honest and if its kept up this whole bow before the gods attitude after every patch will be the downfall of it. Im sure Epi and co are great people and I appreciate the work they are doing to refine this game to a full priced AAA title but I dont think Im ready to praise Ubisoft.,Rainbow6,d7kplw6,10,t5_2t1bl

The time it takes to master recoil of a gun takes time to get used to on console while on pc one or two games and you have the feel for how much to drag the mouse when firing or burst firing.  clunky?  Guns in real life are felt and clunky and have kick.  Its bullshit to say that a click and drag of a mouse resembles anything near what combat or shooting a gun is like while triggers and analog mimic the feel of the gun and surrounding especially if you keep vibration on.  The fact is FPS games are kind of fake on pc as it doesnt properly resemble the complexities of gun combat and is more of a competitive gimmick where mouse clicking and dragging has actually become e sport.  I just dont see it for fps.  RTS or Battle arena games for sure are made best for pc but to say FPS is bad on console is naive when it requires more skill and has a higher skill ceiling.,Rainbow6,d7rfzdy,1,t5_2t1bl

However maximum recoil only makes a difference when using the weapon full auto which is usually longer than a burst but depends on the weapon. So yeah the FH can be better for burst firing if the lower maximum recoil intensity weighs up to the lesser recoil of the first shot of the MB but only for certain weapons. ,Rainbow6,d7xrrsw,1,t5_2t1bl

9130232,0,t1_d896xfp,I dont know I always like following the game through steamcharts which gives a general picture of the games health. I know it doesnt include the full playerbase but it should be representative of the uPlay version at least unsure about the console version but it has been at the top of the sales chart for a while last I read. Basically the game has just as many active players as it has had on release with more players playing steadily. There is also a noticeable blip everytime a new content release is put out with a higher amount of players playing each time. So I would say that the game is doing fine Im not saying its CSGOLoLDotaWoW popular but its definitely doing very well.Just as a comparison CoDBlops steam only and The Division uplaysteam. Basically this game has an amazing ability to draw players back and grow this is actually quite rare for games as they tend to bleed players after release. The game isnt massively popular but the people who do try it seem to continue at a much higher rate than others which means that the population may explode sometime in the future.The sad part is Blops and The Division probably made money capital than R so it plays into more games rather than longer lasting games. I myself look for games that will last a long time which is also why I have never picked up a CoD game as they are destroyed a year after release. But looking at it economic wise game replacement makes far more money that game upkeep.,Rainbow6,d89bmht,12,t5_2t1bl

9167048,0,t1_d8dz25c,gt I dont understand your point in the first paragraphBasically Im trying to set the stage that there are different types of players in casual. It ranges from players who are looking for a warmup in ranked to players who just want to try new strats and operators all the way to players who dont dare venture into ranked unless they have their exact team of five together and even then dont take the outcome too seriously. Your comment applies to one of these types of teams not the others. However for all players who fall into those other groups allowing spawn voting does not necessarily contribute to a more fun game for them.gt In the second paragraph youre saying people will play casual to warm up or if theyre friends are not online. This is not the same thing as Lets sit down and practice for ranked. I also dont understand who is forcing who and how.I never said it was the same. Again if you have a consistent group of five people and you want to get the best results in ranked youre more willing than the person who simply finds two hours in his day after work to sit down and play the game. Some of the people in the latter group may not appreciate always defending and attacking the same two spawns game after game. Further if those people eventually do want to venture into ranked they will have a more holistic understanding of the map with random spawn locations than allowing both teams to choose their spawns.The forcing people to play casual is for the teams who want to play ranked whenever they are together but cant because they feel compelled to practice the lesser used spawn locations if casual only allows them to play the most common sites.gt You also state its a problem if people are forced to do something and they may not want to. Do you think casual players are eager to play certain defensive positions? Like that top spot on Favelas or something?Personally I would prefer to play that spawn in a rotation along with the other locations than the same two locations over and over and over again. Am I singing hallelujah when it comes up? Certainly not. But it also allows me to learn where those windows peek out to whenever my team is defending or attacking aunts apartment.gt How often do you play a match where you get the same defense location over and over and its one that favors attackers? With my system theyd only be playing it once if at all.This is something that should be looked into. Yes sometimes you get the same spawn too many times in a row in casual. I wouldnt mind seeing Ubisoft implement a system where it once a spawn has been played on defense it cant be selected again for that team until overtime. However this does mean you still have an equal chance of seeing the best location and the worst until youve played it once.,Rainbow6,d8dzny0,1,t5_2t1bl
9167206,0,t1_d8drrqw,Fair enough. But a lot of strategies even in the fastest way possible take more than  seconds to set up.

Only thing I can say is play on rank by yourself to learn all the new tricks. Watch youtube video and study if you want to go a little bit extra mile. Dont worry about failing and just enjoy the game. One thing I also found out that my performance is better when I dont give a crap about dying or my ranking.

9312782,0,t1_d8wfdpt,If you buy factory OC computers and dont understand what that entails then thats your own fault. Maybe you should do a little more reading.You are correct thermal throttling doesnt kick in until the temps are above the max safe temperature. However they do prevent any shortterm damage to the computer and mitigate longterm damage. Nobody is going to damage their computer from a week of hightemp operation until they patch it. This is a workaround not a permanent fix.Also when a computer is running hot enough to damage itself its pretty evident based on the noise the fans make and the fact that whatever they are doing will most likely slow down. If they ignore that its their own fault.Also get off your high horse. Im glad that you are a successful businessman but at the same time I dont give a shit.EDITLike hell you own any tech company.

9454677,0,t1_d9e8dlj,I dont really see how Blackbeard encourages a different style of play or helps us think.The point people tend to make about Blackbeard is that you can work around him with good communication and good positioning. The thing is  these things also all work in your favour when facing the other operators  its not as though there are ops that excel at countering flanks specifically  unless you include the claymore ops so basically people have to play exactly the same just be mindful one of the enemy team cant be peeked. In these circumstances BB has a clear advantage in one situation peeking he excels in another flanking hes as vulnerable as anyone else. Therefore there really is no point in not having a BB in your team. And thats not really an interesting choice for players.No one is saying you cant beat a BB what people are saying is it shouldnt be as hard to beat a BB as it is. His ability punishes you for following the rules of the game when it comes down to vs which it often does siege is about peeking and headshots. BB punishes the good players who have learned to do this well and rewards a style of play typically seen in bad players over peeking camping etcBlackbeards inclusion just straight up jarrs with one of the games primary mechanics. Its why hes one of the most frustrating feels bad man operators  he doesnt really feel good to play and he doesnt really feel good to fight. His design just feels abit cheap imho.,Rainbow6,d9eg463,3,t5_2t1bl

9523967,0,t3_5b9lvc,Because Tachankas LMG is stationary its near impossible to over buff it. Add  spin side and front shields suppression fire and whatever else. It still just takes a single shockdrone a single grenade a fire bolt or other aoe effect even a run n gun by after knowing his position is almost always a death sentence for the user lest they get off. Because of this Im in favor of anything short of him driving a tank for a buff.Montange should get  things imo. He should get like  explosion resistance while extended. All shields should get like  by default if their shield is facing the explosion. The amount of skill required to counter a shield is much less than the skill required to operate one.I think your changes to Castle are certainly interesting. Id say require  or  hits from Sledge also. Swap Pulses barbwire and Castles impact grenades or just give Castles impacts to someone else. Castles theme should be pushed more this is true for any Operator undergoing change. If you want to bunker down Castle should be the Operator to choose.A change to Bandit that would be interesting would be to give him only a single battery but all linked metallic objects share the shock effect. This improves defensive options and makes a more interesting game of hide the ball dynamic in game. I would even say allow it to be placed up to X distance away from the object its shocking via a wire for even more mind games.,Rainbow6,d9n145r,3,t5_2t1bl

9544758,0,t3_5bmjqv,uItsEpi if its at all possible can make it topic at your next developer meeting if you can.  Let us know if there is anything in the works or plans to address this.  I would guess about  of matches Im in ranked someone initiates a kick of teammate usually not me btw its usually one person who is always doing it too! In the platdiamond rankings its seems to be excessive IMOP.  As far as I can tell the kick system is really only used for  fails clutch or kick or someone just doesnt like the fact youre not as good as them.  I think this goes against the spirit of the game and really the design of ranked team composition is supposed to be equal for both teams ideally and the skill levels will vary among players.   Video OverviewIve included a video of round being won and my subsequent removal at the end of the match.  A couple of caveats there was no hostility language or toxic behavior.  I rarely get kicked or initiate a kick either.   My personal belief is that there are very few upsides to a teammates removal.  Not even handful of situations warrant a removal unless the behavior is extremely toxic or teamkilling.  It should be noted teamkill has been addressed in many patches and its met my expectations. In the video my teammates didnt like the fact that I didnt look to my right when someone yelled it out and I was dead lol very late callout.   There is zero doubt I just missed hearing the door break and didnt put two and two together guilty as charged.  With that said nobody would havent been able to get into the room had I not empd the fortified walls nor would the defuser timer run down either without killing doc.   It was teamwork I played at my level which is plat not diamond.  The kick was not justified.Here a couple of brainstorming ideas Implement a NFL Challenge system  You get only one vote to kick a week.  If you vote to kick and the person is removed your done kicking for the week.  You get your option to vote kick when your new weekly challenges are added. Monitor  vote kick   Folks that excessively initiate more than xnumber of kicks will in fact themselves be removed from the game.  The punishment should follow the same tiered scheme that teamkills follow especially if its easier to implement.  If you really want to make it fair you can make it retroactive for abusers. Teamkill  Only enable vote to kick when someone has teamkilled.  Disable the vote to kick option for the person who was teamkilled.  This prevents killing a teammate then kicking them.  Ive found that this toxic behavior is commented heavily in this rb sub. ,Rainbow6,d9pl7it,2,t5_2t1bl

9582851,0,t1_d9u610n,Article is very poor. Comparing steam numbers is useless. Also I dont think it takes an analyst to look at steamstats and figure out whats what. Plus the popularity of IW and COD have much higher streamviewers than Rainbow  Siege yes its a new game but still each game itself has many more viewers. And it was pointed out that IW did beat Battlefield  first week sales comparison.Everything this series of articles is writing about is based on GFKs statement here  . Activision in a statement to VG said Infinite Warfare is still the biggest shooter launch of the year so far so there must be some success there even if the sales are lower than Black Ops . According to GFK Call of Duty Infinite Warfare is the  shooteraction game week one launch of  in the U.K.Comparing it to Rainbow  Siege without having adequate playerbase numbers from either Activision or Ubisoft is not good analysis though. Plus using Steam numbers when Rainbow s ecosystem is split on Uplay and Steam for PC makes it even worse of a comparison though you could simply argue that Rainbow  siege has more players on PC anyways. The fact of the matter however is this article is basically click bait on the entire idea that IW is hitting even more franchise fatigue than expected and then throwing Rainbow  siege in there as a easy way to reinforce their argument. And then Payday . Why even compare Payday  to IW? Completly different games. And IWs really popular on consoles. But they dont have those numbers so they do what we all do look up steam stats to talk some shit. Except we do that with our buddies to make a joke about a game rather than pass it off as journalismMight as well start throwing out Overwatch numbers and counterstrike numbers while they are at it. Oh wait Overwatch isnt on steam lol. But seriously the only thing they should be talking about is IW and BF as those are the only two things that are truely relevant to their source from GFK and obviously the most relevant as those two games have often battled each other for FPS players attentions. ,Rainbow6,d9ua5pd,24,t5_2t1bl

9631179,0,t3_5cvfed,Personally I wouldve preferred if they had gone with the E version. Of course they wouldve had to add more content and balance it out but it looked more like a multiplayer Rainbow Six game.What we have now is a great shooter but one that operators on its own unique game logic and it barely has anything to do with the Rainbow Six universe.BTW the game doesnt look like that anymore so it would run at fps on consoles. Destruction is taxing. They either had to take away most of the destruction or lower the graphical quality. They did a little of both mostly the latter,Rainbow6,da08ocw,1,t5_2t1bl

9631673,0,t3_5cy33v,No its fine gold  can que up against diamonds so a goldplat squad can go against all diamonds because there arent that many people at the high tiers. Otherwise the que times would be terrible for diamondsplats.Also because its the end of the season people are at ranks they cant really maintain its more peak ranks. Like I call them end of the season ranks. Example a Gold player who was a silver every other season but is gold now and plays like one. They made it easier to rank up after every season after obtaining a certain rank its easier to get to that rank which lets them push it farther even if their skill does not improve. Another example a plat  who was gold most seasons but somehow got to plat  and does not contribute much in diamond leveled matches. Because you were playing with all golds I think you felt more of this than the match making tbh.,Rainbow6,da0avdc,1,t5_2t1bl

Now the SMG is a close range murderhose like its supposed to be.Smoke players want versatility but it seems like they dont know what versatility means.  Versatility does not mean Im a god at range im a god up close and I have a useful and awesome gadget.  Versatility means that youre decent at everything but not exceptional at anything.I believe that my suggestion above allows smoke to be versatile still while not being a god at long range but have a strong CQB game like he does now.Last Edit  Transfer power from the SMG into the rest of smokes kit he remains powerful and a solid pick but hes no longer simultaneously great for peeking and holding long angles while being the best anchor defender.,Rainbow6,da0d7fz,8,t5_2t1bl

Im on  servers alone that are dedicated to helping people find others to play with and many others servers already have channels and bot functionalities on the side to help people group up.The thing is theyre not mutually exclusive in terms of what they fulfil for certain people meaning it will be more difficult for someone to use your app if theyve already settled in with discord so youd be facing problems of competitive exclusion.And in terms of what you have to offer discord already has the upper hand in respect to how it already has servers with hundreds of members on that also have a findgroup tools to help people find groups to play with whilst your program would I assume launch with a low user count so you get the issue that no one uses the app because not many people use it and its a vicious cycle thats simply propagated by the fact that you need that solid userbase in the first place and its only made more difficult that Discord would offer players what you wouldnt have referring to userbases,Rainbow6,da2bduf,3,t5_2t1bl

9654554,0,t3_5dae3n,gtWe have changed the neck multiplier from .X damage to the same multiplier as the head. Basically that means that a shot that lands in the neck will now count as a headshot. When a player would land a shot in the neck previously the character would play the same animation as a headshot and the blood splatter would be the large one. That led players to believe that they hit a head shot when it wasnt. It even led some players to think it was bad hit registration when they were actually neck shots. We are making that change so that the game will feel more consistent.For real? Back at it again with the neckshots?,Rainbow6,da34i0s,1,t5_2t1bl

9668484,0,t1_da4tp5i,I dont think you have the correct information about DotA . DotA  certainly makes Valve a lot of money. The most recent digital purchase optional for their biggest tournament Seattle named The International brought in around  million  of purchases went to price pool and Valve takes the rest. It was so successful that Riot League of Legends has backpeddled on their stance about crowd funding for their tournaments. And this is only one of the  major tournaments held each year and does not count the countless cosmetics bought and traded for cash which Valve takes a cut from.So I dont agree that a paywall is required to make money on a FP game. Valve has released several articles encouraging their Steamworks developers to make FP changes due to their success with their own ventures TF DotA.Also its always in a game business best interest to keep as many players as possible playing for as long as possible. That will always yield higher revenue. Example lets say  of players buy the season pass and we have  players. Thats  sales. Now say we have  players. Assuming the same percent thats  season pass sales etc.Apply that to Sieges actual numbers best we know according to Ubi. They recently pass  million purchases. Now look at our  made up season pass buyers. Thats  buyers of the season pass. What does it cost something like ? Im sure theres sales on it so lets just say average is . Thats  million.More players  good.,Rainbow6,da4ud0l,2,t5_2t1bl

Castle barricades arent meant to be a wall  theyre just something to slow people down. If you place  Castle walls down the same hallway  they really cannot go that way unless they want to waste all of their supplies.It also helps to couple Castle with Jager and Mute  Jagers ADS will shoot grenades and Ashs charge  and Mute will make breaching charges useless.That being said Castle already received a buff with the reduced ranked timer  but Id still like to see his doors react like walls to explosions instead of like glass.,Rainbow6,daa5jpt,3,t5_2t1bl

9747636,0,t1_daehkzn,Pro players are such a small percentage of the population and honestly such a joke but thats an entirely different thing for another day. Stop trying to fight him in windows when he is strongest. Make him come in or nitro cell him. Or fight him in closerange with a shotgun or melee there are so many other ways to kill him but everyone decides that peaking the window while he is there is the smartest thing to do. They get killed and then complain hes over powered when in reality they are just literally handing him kills because of their own ignorance to get creative and find another way. If you avoid the window he is useless gets bored comes in and then you engage him when he has no cover. Patience is key to fighting him people forget that the attackers have to come to the defenders you dont have to peak him or anyone for that matter if they just wait outside for the defenders to try to attack them the time dwindles away until the attackers are forced to enter and thats when you engage them. People have no damn patience and that is what BB feeds on.,Rainbow6,daelwyx,2,t5_2t1bl

9750255,0,t3_5epmyp,Its advantage is very high rate of fire. Its very close to Twitchs F. If you use flash hider you should have much easier time managing recoil as it gets purly vertical. Add x sight on top of that and its pretty good gun for medium and close distances.Or you can use reflex sight with silencer  recoil somehow finds the head when aiming at center of mass with this gun and because of that there is no downside to silencer especially with how fast this gun fires.,Rainbow6,daexm4e,1,t5_2t1bl

There isnt a spawn where you can die instantly. You have time to counter it. Hell you have  seconds to drone out the usual spots and to communicate with your team about possible threats.

Every operative has their own merit and place in a team and the weapon attachments might as well just be cosmetic for the most part.  Then beyond that its just skins and Im fine with people paying for or grinding to unlock skins if it means I get new levels every few months and regular game updates.I understand what you are saying though about it being distracting.  I dont think of the unlocks as really the main goal of the game.  I mean I play a lot of terrorist hunt lone wolf just because I enjoy it and even when I win which is rare I hardly get any renown for my efforts.

9814664,0,t1_damsng3,Look at MOBAs like league pushing  operators and overwatch which has  and no plans on stopping growing fast. Saying that more operators cannot be balanced is unrealistic. Yes it may well be harder but welcome to competitive games which can be updated to change characters to fit better into new metas look at Doc changes. In terms of your graphics statement the graphics in siege are pretty decent especially if you play on HD textures on PC with  hz. I seriously doubt that a sequel in  years will do ANYTHING in terms of graphics for this game. Even so look at World of Warcraft which is running on a  year old game engine. Some of the models in that are insane on ultra high settings. I would rather the game is well funded by means of a season pass which isnt needed to play any of the DLC host large ESL tournaments with sponsorship and Communicative and friendly developers that love the game they are constant making better    than they to go down the Assassins creed route and bring out multiple bug filled half created games from different devs.Edit You also have to remember that operators in siege have ONE unique ability Overwatch has  and i would say that is balanced pretty well. ,Rainbow6,damv9qw,1,t5_2t1bl

All in all it is definitely bigger than XONE and get close to if not overtakes the PS. So no Pc is not the smallest community. Im going to admit that if you combine both PS and Xbox together than yes you have community bigger than Pc but they cant play together which means they are completely separate. And besides the two console communities are at each others throats all the time,Rainbow6,dav4dn8,1,t5_2t1bl

9890548,0,t1_dawr865,Did you read my post? I dont think you did.They need to REDUCE the distance at which you can throw nitro cells. This is so that EVERY OPERATOR that decides its time to kill that shield has to actually risk their bodies by running somewhat closer to the shield to properly throw that nitro.Right now in the game a defender can easily pop out from a corner into a doorway in a SPLIT second throw that C across the entire hallway and the shield is dead.No risk.If they reduced the C throwing distance the defender actually has  options.a Positionhide closer to where attackers will come from risking themselves.b Run up closer to the shield to kill them this gives the shield some time to either run away or fight back with their PISTOL.c Dont engage.Thats balance.

9943551,0,t3_5hwu0b,Black Beard Valk and Capitao are widely considered the musthaves and the DLC ops most used by the pros. Caviara is generally considered the most useless casual fun only. Frosts pick rate has dropped dramatically since her shotgun was nerfed and people started learning common spots for her traps  but she is still useful in certain situations.Buck has never been super popular largely because  his weapons have quite the learning curve and  his shotgun is much more of a tool than a weapon  meant to open kill holes and valuable passages quickly... but its an ability that can be served by other operators who have better weapons think Sledge. Still he sees some use from the pros and some people swear by his DMR. Season  ops are wild cards right now... but Id expect Hibana to become a new must have on the team strong weapons excellent ability  speed and Echo to used a ton for a bit... and then fall into a similar category as Frost. Awesome at first but people are already learning to counter.  ,Rainbow6,db3o3a6,2,t5_2t1bl

9946658,0,t1_db424l1,You think its reasonable for one character to require much more attention than any other? So if the round comes down to a v and one dude wins because of his operator choice and not because of his skill thats a reasonable thing to exist in a competitive game for you?And no people who dislike him dont suck. The majority of complaining that exists about him from my experience is from top players. Whether they be diamonds I play with or even people like Kixstar because top player win based on their skill not a crutch character. People who never want OP things fixed are people who dont rely on skill and rely on this sort of stuff existing. Blackbeard didnt make sense to be added in a competitive game at all.

10008553,0,t3_5iyaqu,Its banned from pro not regular use in ranked. I dont think there would even be a way to detect it since products like xim translate mouse and keyboard actions and movements to the same signal the ds uses. I question you saying that people are blatantly using a keyboard and mouse. My buddy has been using a xim for months now and he hasnt been called out on it. I think its rare enough to say maybe a drop of players in this games ocean use thsee devices. My buddy was an average player before the Xim and he is still an average player now. I can promise you playing on the PC version of rainbow six and playing on  the ps with something like the xim arent all that similar. If they were the same thing I would agree with you but products like the xim are only capable of what the controller is capable of i.e. movement speeds and aiming. Since both consoles have built in mouse and keyboard support and PS has released a new dedicated mouse and game pad for the ps actually last month also a man in charge of some part of the Xbox one development  I totally forget who or what he does recommends the xim and thinks others should use it as well if theyre truly competitive. I hope some of these views and opinions inform you slightly more. ,Rainbow6,dbc55ta,1,t5_2t1bl

10010023,0,t1_dbcbhdk,Well I lied to you and me. I had to get one more in. Whoopsie. For real though this is gonna be my last response. Your clearly salty. Im sorry youre so bad at the game you feel the need to blame a random operator for it. Have you tried learning to play instead of bitching on the internet? I found that by doing that I had much less of an issue countering what I thought was OP bullshit. Blackbeard counters the meta and you must play around him. You know what skill is? Being able to kill blackbeard instead of whining about how its impossible to kill him through his shield. It was pretty easy when his shields had  and now hes basically useless. Id rather take a recruit. gtWhat if I preaim exactly where he is but it turns out its bb?Thats his ability. What if they were watching and shot you as you came in? What if you were smoke and backed them the fuck off the hole plenty long for you to defuse? What if youd muted that wall and shot thatcher so they couldnt make a hibana hole winning you the round? What if you muted a wall and thatcher just zaps it all ezpz?  What if youre trying to defend a secure area and fuze shits hell over the entire site? What if you backed up against a wall and an ash grenade kills you? What if youre just walking around and get headshot by a stray bullet? What if you think youre safe behind a castle barricade but glaz gets a random headshot through it? What if youre hiding in a sweet corner but a capitao bolt hits you in the ankles and kills you?Do I need to keep going? Theres a lot of varying scenarios and random shit that can happen in this game. Losing to an enemy in a situation where they have a clear advantage doesnt make that operator OP it means you were at a disadvantage and lost. You can create imaginary scenarios for most of the operators where theyre going to win most of the time. gtAnd you know theres something called muscle memory right?Skill is being able to use muscle memory but adjust accordingly when needed. Muscle memory isnt a magical magnet that forces you to aim at the head every time despite what you know you need to do. ,Rainbow6,dbcc2hd,1,t5_2t1bl

10012262,1,t1_dbc7ba7,I never spawn here in ranked and I never run forward in casual if I spawn here. People want to sound oppressed but the truth is that this spawn kill is one of the most avoidable in the entire game. Simple truth. You can literally choose to not die by sitting still for  seconds. Literally  seconds. Thats all the time they have to get that thing off before being detected. If they try and wait three seconds before running out the team may already be around the corner to kill them while theyre detected running back in. Thats why the spawn kill happens immediately. It only ever kills those who careless run forward. Thats literally it. But people want to cry and sound helpless and oppressed. Thats why so many people here are crying that spawn killing only happens with big skill indifferences which is so untrue its unbelievable that these people are getting upvotes. But they have to make it sound oppressive because they dont like it. Avoiding this comes with play time and game knowledge and only the careless get punished for it. Thats why people go for it in ranked against equal skilled opponents. Its not even lack of skill needed to die by a peeker. I see diamonds get killed and I see diamonds successfully peek on other diamonds in ranked. It happens when people are careless and people get punished for being careless. Now that OP knows this spawn kill dying here again is his choice. If he dies he cant blame anyone but himself. This is basically one of the only runout spawn kills where you can choose not to die by it. Just wait  seconds. ,Rainbow6,dbcmkat,2,t5_2t1bl

Lets not comment on COD itself for a bit and acknowledge that CODs loadout interface is actually very smooth and usually it only takes  to  seconds to switch an entire loadout including weapons attachments perks and utilities.One big problem of the interface in R is that every change requires a minor loading of approx  second.

Theyre derived from pred games where there were no projectiles and it was a simple matter of hitscanif your cursor was over the hit box of the enemy sprite you scored a hit.  If not a miss.  No projectiles were involved. Relevantly however its always been a property of the target sprite or object not of the attacker. In fighting games like mortal kombat type games where two character models have to intersect in ways that hurt one but not the other there are indeed hurtboxes on the characters attacks which work as you describe but thats not universal. In siege as with most games hitbox is simply the collision area of an object.,Rainbow6,dbgisub,1,t5_2t1bl

10058025,0,t1_dbifcpp,Ubisoft is the publisher. They are a billionare company which develpops MANY games. They didnt expect siege to have a big succes therefore the low budget after launch. While it did get very succesful i still dont feel like ubi is putting as much money into it as much they are getting from it. And lets add things like ubisoft has never done a competitive multiplayer game the engine siege uses wasnt made for fps games and the general incompetency from ubisoft which im pretty sure everyone expects in every ubi game.

Her launcher is useful even if you already have Thermite and despite its low magazine size her rifle is one of the best in the game and her sidearm SMG is currently better than the SMG.I personally think Capitos guns suck but his gadget grenades and speed are great assets. Buck is great too but his rifle needs some taming before you can start getting kills with him.

So he pretty much split his audicence because on the one hand the squeakers would buy into the whole I am God thing and then you had the other people who would watch as he was a half decent player but once it got too much to his head realised the talk doesnt match the walk and you got to this point it was almost cringeworthy to watch anymore. Because you would be like I get it your a good player no need to force feed that every ten seconds. Yeah I may give it a go as Ive never really thought it was that viable but it seems as if it is possible to use. Ive just always used the MP due to the fact of how consistent the thing is good fire rate good damage and not really much recoil. Yeah Ive heard you talk about your tap firing in another thread I think waiting for it to recenter before firing again right?

Besides fuzing the hostage which pretty much everyone has done and TKing because their operator got chosen is probably just quitting and not using a mic. Dont leave your team behind and you need a mic for call outs. Spotting doesnt always work. . Typically a ThermiteHibana pairing with Thatcher is good. But for attacking you want either a ThermiteHibana for getting into reinforced walls. A TwitchThatcher for destroying electronics. SledgeAshBuck for destroying barricades and normal walls. Then the last two are up to you. Then for defending I run a Jger for his ADS. BanditMute to deny walls. A RookDoc for boosted health. A Valkyrie for extra cams. Then once again up to you.

Dont get me wrong they were good players and of an equal ranking to us all DiamondPlat . But they all had about  ping and they just peeked us the entire game. We lost  because we got defence twice in overtime and the only way to beat them was to play hyper aggressively as it was impossible to hold angles as they killed you before you saw them. I dont know whether this was them forcing some kind of a glitch to get matched on the WEU server or just shitty matchmaking but it was very frustrating. ,Rainbow6,dbu9l8l,4,t5_2t1bl

I understand that the developers want to make it more teambased which is good but its immensely frustrating when you know you couldve won if you had a slightly better team.I dont claim to be very good at the game but the last  or so ranked matches Ive played theres been at least  disconnection on my team within the game and everyone was either around level  and unranked or level    and brand new at the game.  I was at Silver  then dropped straight down to Copper  with nothing but losses each of which I was the highest or nearly the highest scoring player on my team.  I consider myself a good team player but that doesnt change shit when your teammates are near useless.But yes I can see how that would require a lot of coding but honestly its necessary.  It isnt fun being dragged down due to the way others play as it ends up with you either crushing or being crushed.  The current way Ranked works would work perfectly fine for  man teams as then their winloss ratio would actually reflect their collective skill but it just doesnt apply when youre playing with random people who are either at vastly different skill levels disconnect or troll.,Rainbow6,dbwj4wg,2,t5_2t1bl

I just gave you specifics when you can go back and watch castle being used. Lol teams that are extremely experienced and even eith some coordination  will use castle. While yes it would be nice to see him buffed but all he needs is being able to attach bandit batteries to his castles thats it. If a castle door gets taken out by a grenade or an ash charge thats already saves a jager device use. Wastes time and utilities that cant be used on barb wire or to kill a teammate lol. Go watch pducks panix use castle...  or penta on chalet,Rainbow6,dbyv01j,1,t5_2t1bl

Oh and the time MoP launched and the servers were down for an entire day. Dont forget the time Cata launched.. and guess what happened.If you want an example of a glaring bug  Warriors can use an ability called Heroic Leap to jump a large distance. Theres currently a bug that if a warrior uses this ability there is a small chance they will be teleported to a random location in the new zones from the new expac. Its been out for  months guess what bug still happens. You can be in the middle of combat and still end up in a totally unrelated zone. Also happens to Rogues with their new grappling hook.Oh also the entire legendary system they added in was BUGGED from the beginning of Launch. There were also major bugs with some of the Hidden Artifact skins they added in  something players were supposed to hunt and find although they simply found out they were bugged  look at the Arms warrior quest not even being in the game. Prot warrior hidden artifact was attainable by relogging a bug which was fixed and made a daily reset.EVEN IN THE AAA  YEAR OLD WORLD OF WARCRAFT BUGS EXIST.,Rainbow6,dbzzy41,1,t5_2t1bl

For these room adjacent walls a good way to know whether it should be open or not is either asking your team what they think or going into the next room and scoping out what advantages leaving it open have versus closing it like are there doors and windows in the next room that give attackers quick access? is there a camera in that room that can help you pop some wall bangs? can your team circle back through the open wall to the objective or not? etc  ,Rainbow6,dc16kau,1,t5_2t1bl

Guess what I just hit diamond today.Sometimes on casual you will be matched with high levels on both teams watch what plat players are doing and try to understand why. Dark Souls taught me to learn from every death  watch the kill cam know why did you die and try to never do the same mistake again.

And if youre on console and nobody in your team has a mic for some reason spotting might be necessary so your team at least knows the direction the enemy is coming from. Using cameras with proper communication will give a massive boost to your game so if you can do it do it.Dont only apply it to the cameras though the risk vs reward is everywhere in the game and if youre looking to get better you should be thinking about your actions in that way even if its only postgame you can apply any corrections or improvements in the next game.,Rainbow6,dc9owwh,1,t5_2t1bl

10286648,0,t1_dca0n7i,Thus spawnkillingspawnrushing and defenders running outside can be easily countered by just watching the entrances.You cant watch every entrance everytime. You need your teammates sometimes and if some teammates are dead its more difficult.Also some maps like Kanal and Favela theres a whole lot of windows and doors where defenders can peek from. Theres no way you can get to watch all of them unless the entire team is doing nothing but watching windows.Its just not realistic strategically speaking. I understand watching windows and doors I do that many times but its not viable everytime.Also for peeking many times its instant. Defender breaks barricade and instantly aims and shoots. You as an attacker would never see it coming until its too late. Sound in Siege is very inconsistent and many times you wont hear any sounds if you have teammates talking or there are other noises going on in the background.,Rainbow6,dca1qkw,-5,t5_2t1bl

10341404,0,t3_5o2xso,There are many new players playing this game still. And while there is a big learning curve to this game and the placement matches on ranked may make it seem like you have no chance to win or even survive a round youll get around to it. Being behind doesnt mean much in this game. Because in this game you dont grind for better weapons or gear and most v firefights are over in one second regardless of the weapons used. You have operators characters to unlock and each one only carries certain weapons with them. There are no BEST operators thats the beauty of this game its quite balanced although some operators still might need work. Also no match is quite the same. I have played loads of matches on each map and I still dont know them that well because there are so many tactical possibilities with the breaching system or just simply shooting through little holes on the walls or ceilings. Plenty of room for imagination and tactical approaches. The mechanics of the game run deep every match is a different monster and it hasnt gotten boring.My point is nobody wins by grinding. Its not one of those games. There are no magical weapons that you have to grind for there are no buffs for your operators that you can get by grinding. Its all about the gameplay itself which is great. The only advantage that the more experienced players have is map knowledge and certain tactics they have come up with. If you have friends you have one advantage many people still join ranked games with randoms. Its often apparent at least at the lower ranks that they dont even communicate. You and your friends will be on the same team communicating with each other and coordinating your moves. After youve gotten used to the game and how unforgiving and at the same time rewarding it is that will be a huge asset.Its worth it especially if your friends get it too. You wont have to worry about some toxic randoms coming in and teamkilling you for sport. The learning curve can be high but its really exciting once you start to get a hang of it.,Rainbow6,dcg99mf,7,t5_2t1bl

10384311,0,t3_5opfmh,Thats whats great about this game you have to work as a team. Someone really skilled can carry a team to wins at certain points but that wont last. Im not saying youre not a team player but it seems like you dont have a steady group to play with and you always get new people on the team and they dont all even communicate.I hope you find a team there are plenty of players looking for teammates. Try rRSTeams and you might get lucky. In the meantime there are probably some mistakes you are doing. Think about how you lose how you die and why that is and then slowly adjust yourself to find a solution. Try to take failures as learning experiences because in this game people will fail a lot. I should take my own advice because I just rage and whine when I fail instead of a learning from it and b calm down and try to use camerasdrones for my alive teammates and try to help them to win. Also keep an eye what your teammates are doing. Some of them might be good and youll get tips from just watching them. Some of them might have left a crucial spot undefended so you might want to take that spot if yours isnt that crucial.There is also the fact that you dont master the maps after three weeks. The maps are hard to master in this game because there are so many variables and possible tactics  you can use and also those that can be used against you. Some of them are confusing mazes with similar looking locations too. All of that will sort itself out and youll get to know your surroundings in time. Myself I have plenty to learn from all the maps still. Choosing the operators is a thing too. Many of them complement each other such as ThermiteThatcher and CastleMute. A wellbalanced squad of operators can mean a lot. Also remember that certain operators can counter the opposite teams operators. For example Pulse can work well against Fuze and IQ can work well against Pulse! Stick with operators youre comfortable with at first and then try to expand from there instead of constantly switching them and never feeling comfortable with any of them. If someone is uncomfortable at roaming Caveira might be the wrong choice. If someone absolutely hates leading the attack and always stays behind someone like Sledge might be a bad choice. Anyone can learn new things but its best to take it easy at first.There is plenty to learn in this game. Thats a good thing it doesnt get boring that easily. ,Rainbow6,dcl4jlu,1,t5_2t1bl

Maybe many are unaware but you cannot actually silence a gun. Its a myth spread around by hollywood and video games. You can only lower its ear damaging blast just a few dbs but guns with these attachments still could be heard from miles away especially high caliber rounds.

It is abysmal that this is being played at pro level where its even happened there as well. This shooter is leaps and bounds ahead of anything else on console game play wise but when your game constantly crashes and disconnects people you have a big big issue that in reality shows that the game just is not up there as a AAA title sadly.,Rainbow6,dcwra0q,1,t5_2t1bl

10497951,0,t3_5qc98v,Are you sure you mean Valkyrie? I ask because she is a DLC operator which means itll take K renown or  RP to unlock her. Smoke on the other hand will cost at most K depending on what other operators you have already unlocked. As far as gameplay is concerned. Smoke is a very valuable Defender if used properly. He can shut off one or multiple entrances with his smoke grenades and kill a lot of time. His shotgun is also great for opening up rotation spots between bomb sites and just allow for more ability on Defense. You shouldnt do very much roaming with Smoke so if you like to roam Id advise against choosing Smoke. Valkyrie cams will give pivotal information that could make the difference between winning or losing a round if used properly. You job as Valkyrie will be to make sure to properly place your cams in the set up stage of rounds. After that you can roam or stay near the OBJ and watch your cams. Her SMG is very good when used properly and he shotgun is not a bad choice either. Valkyrie is very versatile so you can mold her to whatever playtype you want as long as you place the cameras properly. Id argue that there should pretty much always be a Smoke AND Valkyrie on a team because they are both very good at what they do. Id base your pick on how you play. ,Rainbow6,dcy1xh0,3,t5_2t1bl

10514025,0,t1_dczbwtq,Because people dont like certain maps. For instance Favelas runs like absolute dogshit. I have an RX  and i and run Witcher  on  constant. Yet that map cant get over  outside and  inside I had to change my settings from ultra to medium just because of that map.  No other map has comes below  on ultra yet favelas cant get above  on medium. This puts me and my friends at a disadvantages seeing as this apparently has to do with the Nvidea bullshit they put in nvm runs like crap on those cards aswell. Meaning an automatic loss winlose on favelas is  while my overall winrate is around .. This in turn does not reflect the real skill just poor game optimization for AMD at least.A friend of mine actually deleted everything called Favelas in the dir because he rather crashes than play that map again.They should either delete it or fix it.

Id REALLY like it to be a deployable shield since it looks pretty huge and its a good addition in camping the objective. However I do notice that there might be a hatch below her and thats why shes holding the gadget right there. Some people are forgetting that if its an attachment to a wall or window of some sort much like castle then she can not hold the barricade out like that in the open she must be interacting with the window or door to be able to bring it out.

Shotguns are the only weapons in the game that have spread when ADS though so this isnt something that would affect any weapons other than shotguns.This behavior with shotguns is not intentional and will be fixed in a later update.Thanks!,Rainbow6,dd6vuou,16,t5_2t1bl

It would most likely just end up with both teams up against the window looking at each other. You could always just throw a Valk cam out and get a better view of the area anyway. Im hoping she can detonate it. If you see an enemy outside aim at them blow the hole and kill them suddenly. I could see that being useful. But just having a window? Im not so sure.

Jackal could be useful to haunt the roamers if there is another attacker with him. And Mira in my opinion is designed for defenders because of that window it can be used as a replace of cameras in many cases for example in canal you can put a window in front of the large hall that conects both buildings so you can expect theme to come from there os the main door.

They can see you before you can see them their hitbox lags behind them they can significantly outperform you just because their ping is high. This is due to RBs lag compensation where it favors high pings in order to make their experience better. What do you guys think should be done about it?

Maybe Im just too used to how things used to be but for most of the time Ive been gaming most games had no match making and everyone was fine with that. Also in some cases MM does more harm than good. I cant play CSGO right now because my rank decayed from dmg all the way to gold Nova .

You guys want a game with big playerbase but your servers cant handle k players? Its just a joke. Not to mention high pings and stuff. Azure servers are just not enough. I wish ubisoft would do it the way blizzard does. They put lots of money into their games so they can capitalize more. While ubisoft tries to capitalize a lot without investing the lowest possible amount of money. No anticheat at launch is a great example. If the player base would have been growing im sure we wouldnt have gotten an anticheat. Do you guys want the game to start dyinglike the division and only fix the problems when its nearly too late?

10641157,0,t1_dddizv7,I think the only type of roaming he adresses is spawn peeking. Otherwise you can easily take routes where Jackal needs to really get into harms way to reach.  The counterplay exists in crouching through some sections and mutecaveira and what not. I mean this gives your encounters a little more stake if you get spotted by a drone you can try that way again if you prefire and miss you can rotate and go again now. With Jackal into play you just need to consider more consequences in how you plan your routes and escape plans thats all.,Rainbow6,dddjy9m,1,t5_2t1bl

10649922,0,t3_5selic,If you like dmrs like Twitchs  or maybe even Glazs ots or youre able to compensate recoil very very well I would probably go for Buck. Hes more fun very useful for the team has a shotgun and ardmr. The AR is great if you are able to compensate the recoil which is incredibly hard on console even with holo sight. Blackbeard is a bad concept for this game one shot headshot kills so he tends to be op. This is why he got nerfed and got much worse. If you dont kill some defenders or block hallways or areas by watching from a window youre useless for the team. Still his shields even if they dont take a lot of bullets right now will save your life in some situations and thats why hes picked in pro league. His ads time and normal movement with the shield is terrible though. If youre more of a casual gamer I would get Buck probably because hes more fun imo. Destroying walls and surprise enemies behind them or even get surprised yourself is great and rushing with the skeleton key is also lots of fun. ,Rainbow6,ddegh47,1,t5_2t1bl

10650597,0,t1_ddeiezq,Great you had some good games as glaz. Just because someone can do something with an operator or weapon doesnt mean its overpowered or not underpowered. Also clutch isnt exactly definable . A v can sometimes be called a clutch its fluff. Fact of the matter is you did well against people who didnt have the highest chance at having better positioning than a glaz who needs to approach a defending position. And even worse in proleague. Retrieve the defuser attack a defended location with no utilities other than a semi auto rifle kill everyone or get in and plant and then defend it. Ive done plenty of amazing glaz plays myself but no pro league player is going to take that chance unless they are absolutely certain of their aim discipline being  better than anyone elses angle. And neither of those things is realistic. ,Rainbow6,ddeizd2,1,t5_2t1bl

Think it lasts too long to keep giving that much information although you can move they will hear and a few seconds later your pinged againI also think he can see the footprints for way too long like while in the drone stage I was putting Valkyrie cameras up over a minute into the game I get scannedI like he is a counter for roamers and adds a good dynamic but feels like a way to nearly stop roaming altogether.

10680077,0,t3_5ssyj5,Ive noticed a number of bugsissues in the short amount of time that Ive actually been able to play the update. I play on the Xbox one btw.. Trying to change Twitchs F loadout crashed the game a friend tested it and he crashed too. Vaulting over a small wall on the nd floor of Coastline in the room with the pool table allows defenders to get on the roof outside at times. Drones occasionally spawning on the table in tea room on the map Skyscraper when objective is in the tea room. Both defenders and attackers in a custom game on Coastline fell through the map and were unable to use gadgets abilities or even shoot weapons. We could however melee. New DLC Operators invisible but guns can be seen. Doesnt always happen but an invisible Jackal is not a fun thing to be fighting!As for the Caveira interrogation issue that happened to me when I tried interrogating a Sledge on the map Kanal. Nothing comes to mind that could have caused it.Ive also been having problems with my Xbox since installing the update. Everything seems slower I cant download anything else I keep getting disconnected from parties.

Thats simply a thing that its likely that nobody ever thought of I mean until you have thousands of people playing and one of them thinks of it or does it by accident its unlikely to even occur. Let alone at the right angle and distance and everything. Software like this is HUGGGGEEEEEE and while I think theres an argument to be made for a beta environment theres not necessarily a community large enough to make it worthwhile think of the major players that have a Beta enivronment they tend to be HUGE games like LoL,Rainbow6,ddhqi2z,1,t5_2t1bl

Exothermic ChargesHibana PelletsGadgetsPlayers can be destroyed through the Black Mirror via melee attack.   Rank Charms clip through Miras hand on the Vector.   On some walls there is a small gap between the Black Mirror and the wall.   Jackal cannot see the red light from active cameras while his Eyenox device is active.   Mira is sometimes able to place her Black Mirror Gadget on barricaded doorways next to Reinforced Walls.   In some instances the canister that expels the glass on a Black Mirror cannot be interacted with.   The Black Mirror does not always pass through both layers of a two layered wall.   The Black Mirror can be partially covered when placed between a large and small reinforced wall.   The Black Mirror can be deployed on nonLOS walls.    Weapons   Hibana Pellets have a graphical glitch when used on Coastline.   Optics are larger. This is due to the normalization of the weapon optics and their distance from the camera.   Hibanas XKAIROS Pellets do not properly detonate after being triggered.   XKAIROS Pellets do not fire properly around corners.   CE is not firing in alignment with weapon sights   Sight on the SAT Sidearm is not properly aligned. Rounds land below the top of the front sight post.    Accessories   Rook and Doc share the same Red Crow headgear.   Diamond Weapon Skins are not currently available in the store.   Obsidian Weapon Skin is not able to be applied to Year  Pass Operators.   Aki No Tsuru weapon skin is not properly rendering.   Holiday weapon skins cannot be applied to weapons.   Weapon Charms are able to be equipped to weapons but are not displayed in game.   Kapkan Elite skin sleeve is sometimes not properly rendered.   Diamond Skin not available for Year  Operators.    Gadgets   On some windows when a Fuze charge is placed on a barricaded window with unbroken glass it will be destroyed after the first charge is fired.   Yokai Drone camera resets after leaving the drone control view and reentering it.   Fuze loses control after detonating a second Cluster Charge while using his shield.   Gadgets cannot pass through objects that had glass that was destroyed.   Players are not able to place gadgets on a Castle Barricade when the window debris is still present.    Spawning   Players are sometimes locked to a distant camera angle when loading into a match. Workaround Do not press the dashboard button on console or alttab on PC during the winning showcase.   In some instances a player will spawn in while looking through a drone and will not be able to control their Operator.    HUDUI   HUD sometimes flickers on PS.   PSXB Unable to interact with the scoreboard.   Some items in the store are displayed as a magenta block.    MatchmakingOnline   Crossregion PS parties are being split up in the matchmaking process.   Following a server outageback end maintenance players may receive  RenownXP. This issue is short lived and is corrected after the scripts finish running  minutes after an outagemaintenance.    Misc   Spectators sometimes see the wrong Operator info when viewing teammates.   Limbs clipping through reinforced walls.   When players are spotted by Cameras they can seehear the ping as well.   Heavy breathing from DBNO state persists after being revived.   A section of Clubhouse is accessible via clipping.

Carrying a shield the size of a barricade isnt fair even if his shield can be shredded by shotguns. And giving him a submachinegun to use when he isnt carrying the shield is much too overpowered.

Skull Rain introduced the universal weapon skins and the universal seasonal skins. The Skull Rain ones couldnt be equipped on the SAT operators but there was a bug when they launched that prevented them from being able to equip multiple skins same happened at Skull Rains launch and it was assumed the Skull Rain skins were a part of that bug.The issue is that there was still no clarification on howwhen they could be used. Instead we were told theyd be going away at the end of the season like all seasonal skins beforehand with no mention that they were restricted to only ops that were released at the time. ,Rainbow6,ddk03jq,1,t5_2t1bl

10711891,0,t1_ddksjjt,One thing I will say is that the current week notwithstanding the servers have steadily improved since launch. There wasnt any big patch to fix everything but patch after patch the stability definitely increased throughout the first year. In times when the stability dipped they were able to fix the issues to get it back to a reasonable place. The server stability hasnt been some giant cesspool of crap that many on this sub would have you believe.Like I said the current week has been very rough and hopefully they get it resolved soon. And please note I am not just blindly defending them for their decisions I just dont like the outright lies that float around this subreddit about how the servers have always been this bad. The current state of affairs is some of the worst weve seen but that was coming off a steady climb in performance throughout the lifespan of the game so far.,Rainbow6,ddkunsi,1,t5_2t1bl

I mean in all honesty I cant think of many levels where thered be a small or skinny obstacles people could perfectly hide behind and not get harmed by the smokefire. And even if those areas existed it would be hard to judge how much of your body hitbox would be exposed from that obstacle. Like a foot or elbow might still poke out and it would still damage you.

10720845,0,t1_ddlao3s,Its tricky because smoke and fire should wrap around many obstacles.  Pillars desks doorways etc.  A smokefire cloud should envolop these obstacles not be blocked by them.However as shown in this post it should also not go directly through walls where theres no way around within the radius.  It seems like a hard problem to solve.  Except siege already makes those calculations!  Thats how sound works in this gametracing the path around obstacles.  What they should do is check a few points at the edge of the radius and see if theres a direct sound route to them within the radius.  If there is smoke goes there.  If not smoke is blocked.,Rainbow6,ddlrxxv,4,t5_2t1bl

As an attacker if youre teammate dies to a roamer that roamer should be smart enough to A Fall back to the objective room or B Circle back round the map. I see it far too often where roamers get greedy even after a kill and their location is compromised yet still push forward when the enemy team is expecting them which is why as an attacker you should use the kill cam to bait roamers out. Works all the time. The kill cam adds another layer to a game that requires smart play. I like it.,Rainbow6,ddm12zw,2,t5_2t1bl

No.  But its pretty low on the hierarchy of priorities when you might have to deal with getting shot or stabbed or blown up.  These weapons would be around for years of such situations over time they will accumulate superficial damage.  These kinds of operators are absolutely going to be very careful with their weapons but theyre also going to be in situations very regularly where it is less important to worry about the finish than it is to do something else.Its like climbing gear.

10762051,0,t1_ddpvaov,KD is kind of a joke stat in a game like RS though. Ive seen some of the best players carry something like . KD. Now if you saw that number in any other FPS youd think this player was total garbage. I myself typically have an overall KD between  with most other shooters but I sure as hell cant break the  figure with a game like this. Its just a completely different beast.For starters youre not in a game where youre up against a huge number of opponents and there is no respawning involved. Meaning every stupid little death whether its falling or being TKed is like taking a sledgehammer to your stats. And to add to all that lets face it... this is still a really buggy game where things like peekers advantage and various glitches make earning a solid KD a constant uphill battle. Sometimes youll just end up dying over shit that you have zero control over. Theres no point in sweating over it.Luckily the game puts greater emphasis on doing things that benefit your team more. Like destroying enemy cameras and traps. Or setting up barricades and jamming enemy drones. Its still possible to be MVP without having the highest number of kills in a game. And I really appreciate that they allow that given some of the issues discussed above on why KD is a bad stat to go by.,Rainbow6,ddq0y39,3,t5_2t1bl

10765609,0,t3_5tuwz5,I agree that its annoying when people dont rush in to save KD.However Im seeing a lot of discussion below about how Kills arent important how they shouldnt be tracked etc...and I think thats simply going too far AND it reflects an inaccurate perception of the important of kills in the game.Full Disclosure  Im not  at all  a high KD player . KD after a year of hard work to improve it.  I truly wish I was a higher KD player because thats where I derive my most enjoyment from the game.  The hunt.  The excitement.  The tense push through enemy territory knowing that my decisions for good or ill can lead to an easier kill or put myself in true danger.  Leveraging both the map and my teammates and our abilitiesgadgets to get one up on our opponents  thats a lot of fun.Sometimes I think that people in their kneejerk haste to hate on kills forget that the games currency is player lives.  All the clever gadgetry placement all the good callingout and teamwork is primarily not entirely revolving around killing your opponents.  If your team kills all five of their opponents you win.  Doesnt matter if you ever even defused that bomb or rescued the hostage or held your ground long enough to Secure the Area...you win if they all die.  So clearly whether we like it or no kills matter.And yes you can win all three different game modes without anyone dying but other than Hostage Rescue where it can happen a bit more easily thats a rarity.  Usually your attempts to complete the matchs particular objective leads to conflict which in turn inevitably leads to someones demise.TLDR  Kills DO matter whether we like that fact or not but so does Teamwork. The ultimate marriage then is someone who plays well in a team but also gets kills.  ,Rainbow6,ddqe5c9,1,t5_2t1bl

10817879,0,t3_5up6qs,GENERALLY compensator makes your spray patter consistant with both the path it takes and the consistancy between different spray they take same path each time and they generally go straight up instead of onto the side. Although when bursting it takes longer time to reset at  accuracy. flash hider remove the bullet trace and is hybrid between the muzzle brake and compensator kinda. Good for bursting pattern dencer than compensator more random in full auto spray unlike compensator.  muzzle brake is almost always the best for bursting. It has a tight burst spread and the fastest reset time. It is usually dead accurate on the first  shots. Although the full auto spread usually is all over the place and path more random takes a different one every time. Note that there are loads of exeptions it comes down to the gun and your playstyle. Like some guns oddly have a better spray pattern with the flash hider and others good burst with the compensator. ,Rainbow6,ddvsdkl,5,t5_2t1bl

Causing the game to crash. Or processor could be the culprit. Its really hard to say if youve gone through and ensured that you have drivers all updates and on their most stable versions. And youve completely re downloaded and installed the game and done everything you can to alleviate the issue.  Its possible you have a hardware combo that just doesnt like the game.

You wait for said jersey but it never arrived. You contact customer service no response. You then get into contact with your back who offers a refund. You could take that refund or you could wait and see if the company will ship your jersey. The company finally gets back to you just to let you know the jersey isnt being shipped and theyre not giving you a refund. Wouldnt you be a little pissed off? OP paid for a product Ubi was supposed to deliver on. OP put up his end of the deal and Ubi didnt deliver the product.

10998782,0,t3_5x1mrv,Here are some tips I thought of from the top of my head while being bored on a maths lesson D note they are not in any particular order. You can see which side will make the most use of that tip in the brackets. I hope it helps you. Have fun sieging!BOTH When peeking DO NOT CROUCH OR CRAWL. While it may look like you are safer and more protected but you move much slower and anybody who might be watching that angle will see the tip of your gun or various body parts before you even see into the room. BOTH Knowing the maps is an absolute neccesity. DEF Try to think when reinforcing dont just blindly reinforce first wall you see. Never reinforce between two bombs always try to make hole in those walls instead. ATT Drones are not used to get points at the start of the round. Place your prep phase drones around the map in problematic parts to be able to get valuable intel.ATT It is usually a good idea to split your attack into twothree attack parties. Not really a neccesity tho.BOTH To buy Thermite Thatcher Bandit MuteBOTH Get comfortable with destructibility of walls it makes for amazing tactical options.DEF Never forget to do something about hatches on defense. Sometimes it may be better to hold room above objective and use the hatch to defend more efficiently. Experiment. this works for example on skyscraperATT Smokes are broken while useful you cant fully rely on their effectivness.DEF It is ALWAYS a BAD idea to stay piled up in one roomVERY IMPORTANT Think. If you wanna go braindead go play csgo.,Rainbow6,deeofwz,3,t5_2t1bl

11054680,0,t3_5xr9z3,Good points. And generally how I view rank. I play ranked because it is the game in its intended form. Chosen objective spawn and attack spawn etc. shorter round but longer game.Your rank is an indicator of your general skill someone in gold IS better than someone in copper. Hands down. But outliers exist some people do shit in gold but got carried there some people do great in copper and will end up in gold but couldnt carry hard enough and dropped to copper or whatever. But for the majority of players you can estimate someones capabilities by their rank. People using it as a means to shit on people however just means they are shitty people and shitty people can have all kinds of ranks. All in though play rank learn get better but dont attach so much value to ranked. Take it seriously thats fine but dont be so concerned about the loss. A huge problem is performance anxiety. When you are playing ranked and assign that huge value to it you may suffer from the anxiety and play worse. Like getting anxious that a doctor is going to find something wrong leading to your increased heart rate causing your doctor to mention your fast heart rate. The difference is doctors recognize that happens to people while people dont recognize it happens to themselves. Edit only thing I would like to see is maybe a blurb or summary of the video in the list itself if people cant watch it takes a small amount of effort but will be recognized. More people will be inclined to spend their time on your content when your content is better quality. I enjoy your vids so far but sometimes cant always watch. ,Rainbow6,del12dh,1,t5_2t1bl

I do not assume Jger is low level because of the angle I assume he is either ballsy reckless stupid or low level because he peeked that window without the slightest knowledge that someone may be rappelling to the roof anyone could at any moment and he would die instantly because all he was focused on was the stair window. I no doubt think he was high rank because of the angle it is a mean angle but I only questioned his rank because of the recklessness of the peek itself. Downvote me all you want not you chrspe but this is my opinion and all I stated originally was that it was weird now my inbox has blown up because people need to argue my wording sorry for poor wording and that I wasnt exact with it I really am no sarcasm. ,Rainbow6,delzfkx,1,t5_2t1bl

11072920,0,t1_den2x8s,Maybe so but an Echo drone is much better than a valkyrie camera. For one they can move to relevant locations but are also very effective in scouting out areas for roamers and can be brought back into the objective room late round to serve a similar role to a smoke.Id also say you over exaggerate his drawbacks. Spotting is a bit pointless and no teammates viewing can largely though not completely be accounted for with good communication and assigning Echo to camera duty. Less flexible deployment is a factor on some maps most notably Favelas and Chalet but the Drone can still peek outside momentarily  and is less likely to be destroyed doing so.Hes already great in the hands of a skilled player who has put some time into him. Two drones at once would be a bit much and could cover so much ground. A small buff could be nice but Id only suggest something like having a reserve or even having a basic attacker drone in reserve. Its not a tachanka situation where hes completely unusable.,Rainbow6,den3svg,1,t5_2t1bl

11159560,0,t1_dew5ruq,I think that would kill momentum of attackers and as a result the round... Its good to be able to put on doorways to give attackers something to worry about when rushing the room but when the attackers have to slowly go through the whole map in case of a trap it will take sooo long to get through a round. I think the biggest problem is that the trap is too easy to disable... it should be just a little wider on the door forcing the attacker to either crawl under to shoot out or find another route. This might be a bit OP though because it would turn doors into serious choke points,Rainbow6,dewxa0m,1,t5_2t1bl

11162261,0,t3_5z7fp2,I seem to have solved it by disabling the single active recording device and disabling the microphone device in the playback section. Acces this by  going to the volume icon in the taskbar whilst on desktop and clicking right mouse button you then proceed to click on recording devices. You disable the recording device microphone. You also do the same in the playback devices section and disable the exact same microphone for me this was the hands free version of my headset as there were  listed for the same headset.This resolved the issue for me. However you cant use your microphone still but at least it fixes the game muting itself after anyone in your team including you talks in voice chat. ,Rainbow6,dex8azj,2,t5_2t1bl

11193989,0,t1_df0hxhk,Its frustrating that Reddit simple remove all text if page somehow reloads during edit accidentally CTRLR for example.So Ill rewrite my answer in shorter form. There is no actual need to select particular operator for tactical approach. Dynamical destruction nature of game give you very different approach for same objective. And most effective approach still just preshoot good nothing more.. Even proteams not always pick Thermite. Look at S stats before Hibana.. This game basically MOBA shooters. There is so much MOBA at market right now. And almost all of them use phasing team switch. Select character go to action phase with killres with timer or round by round systems then team switch once for balancing reasons and thats all. Its actually works there is hundreds reasons behind this kind of system.... The reason why Rs is somehow popular not in team switching format but purely because of best graphic  destruction combination on market. Even BF weaker IMHO.. The only reason you complaining about I dont wanna loose ability to switch teams because you have this ability right now and never played this game different. If this game come with classical team switch system from the beginning I bet youll never find out difference.. Similar considerations its almost same like this game was realized with not giving unfair advantage ranked without hit markers. Then devs pop up with Oh now we want to reduce gap between Casual and Ranked so welcome pretty fair hit markers. There was very much complaints from players about it from players including me I never gonna like this unfair stuff. But truth told it actually not change any aspect of competitive game mode. Also this change not increase casual players interest in ranked but it was predictable for all except UBI.gt you are just making educated guesses like I can.Yeah its purely educated guess based on exception almost all alternatives save developers incompetency in memory management.gt overall nature of the game is completely different than when youre playing a more organized form of the sport.Still cant agree with your logic. Number of street players is thousands of times larger than professionals. Same with street basketball at USA. And this casual players take much fun from this game. Also ALL pro players was kids and learn street rules before come to sport club and become familiar with thousands nuances of professional game.Now you suggest that same method working with IRL sport games not gonna work with cybersport? Why where did you see REAL problem? Competitive mode rule changes hundred times simpler to fathom than difference between street and true soccer am I wrong?..P.S. Also looks like another my attempt to discuss something with reddit community failed thread was hardly downvoted you the only one who actually think and communicate. Most ppl looks like prefer not change anything at any reason and just uninstall any game when its gets boring for them.And meanwhile a third of my ideas all downvoted also lol since CBT actually was realized by developers since than coz it was really bad impact on game popularity. And those  that completely ignored by now all sort of broken staff reducing number of active players this game have.Thing is all redditors is active players. Those how drop this game not come to reddit for discussion about bad sides. Those who think that some aspect of game just unacceptable not stay with game long enough for check this Reddit.,Rainbow6,df0tq13,1,t5_2t1bl
11194872,0,t1_df0v7xx,Castle is in a tough spot. To play him effectively I definitely cant you need a ton of map knowledge. Right now he exists to funnel attackers into certain chokepoints where the defenders can cut them down.Putting his barricades outside of the objective forces attackers to either funnel or burn their explosives to knock down the barricades. He can also spring a trap on unsuspecting attackers by hitting the barricade  times  regular hits will break it then hitting it once more once the attackers come by. Usually I run into Castles that board up the objective. This traps people when Fuze comes knocking and locks out roamers if the objective gets taken. Now theres Glaz to worry about too. ,Rainbow6,df0xbmf,1,t5_2t1bl

11197832,0,t1_df164s7,Tips for playingI like to save at least one charge as they really do come in handy if you need a section cleared out. Most  floor sites have a spot where you can fuse above but when you do dont keep fusing look to see if roamers are coming because  times they are. Fusing windows is useful but some people sit near and listen and pulse can just shoot you if your not careful. Use flashes if your using his sheild but use breaching charges with guns equipped because if your fusing upstairs you might as well open up some holes in the floor to peak down. Specific MAP info keep in mind this is for secure area onlyon Hereford base if they dont reinforce hatch always fuse it thats just ez kills. If they go on first floor you can fuse every floor on the second story.On the new map coastline if they go blue bar or kitchen you can fuse above them not many people are aware of this and can lead to come serious kill feeds. On consulate you can fuse above garage it doesnt look like it but you can fuse ALL of it. Also archives but thats well knownOn chalet you can fuse from bar into the snowmobile garage and the little cubby everyone hides in between wine cellar and garage is fuseable AND has a hatch that I see many players miss.just FYI if they go bar you can fuse above them and get behind the bar as well if you just go above them into library. Kitchen is ALSO fuseable if you go directly above it.Im pretty sure that all the floor on second level is fuseable but dont quote me on thatfavelas hopefully you know enough that you know how to fuse on that map plane this ones tricky a lot of people think hes no good at this map but people dont know that you can fuse everywhere on the top floor. Also the storage area is fuseable right above it next to the hatch. Also the top cockpit section has a hatch that fuses down a common camping spot. Border still learning callouts on this map but pretty much the whole second floor is fusable sorry on that oneYacht this one isnt that great for fuse and you have to rely on fusing hatchesassuming they dont reinforce them pretty situationalHouse all of the second story floor  is fusable. Above weight room is fusable. This map is more about windows and maybe doors. comment if I missed something or my English is shit because Im doing this off the mobile so I have no doubt theres mistakes have any questions ask them ,Rainbow6,df19eap,3,t5_2t1bl

This could also be due to if you have a limit of downloads you may be getting throttled?For example if you purchased internet for GB download a month and you download .GB then your internet is throttled  Or in other terms your speed is dramatically decreased due to you exceeding your monthly limit.That effects your gaming as well as to game you are constantly downloading datastuff whilst playingonline so if your throttled to kbslike some providers when you exceed your monthly limit you will notice very high ping and a substantial amount of lag.If your playing via wifi then I suggest possibly investing in a ethernet cable to run from your router to your pc? In most cases that might fix it but like I said you need to find out what kind of internet your on if there is any limitsor Caps to your plan and if youve gone over it or not.If none of the above fix it it may be wise to possibly change internet providers.,Rainbow6,df4idet,1,t5_2t1bl

11279706,0,t3_60z5tg,Naw we shouldnt have to spend real money to make an operator playable it would set a dangerous precedent that Id hate to see in Siege this is on Ubisoft to fix if they have any interest in balancing the game and making all operators viable picks.For me they either need to do as you say and remove his earmuffs andor give his shield little wings on the top that cover his head better. Personally Id also like to see him be  armour and  speed I know its not a popular idea and no other operators have those stats but it would make him pretty lethal and unique on the attack while also playing up to his name to me Blitz implies something hard aggressive and fast at the minute hes just vulnerable broken and slow. Making him  is an option but for me shield operators should be bullet sponges so taking armour away from him would be a bad move I know the shield is supposed to take the flak but you still have to expect the operator to take the odd bullet here and there.,Rainbow6,dfajdwb,1,t5_2t1bl
11280110,0,t1_dfakz61,Yes Jackal would be a very solid counter.Actually Jackal would be the greatest counter as the operator is pretty much stationary unless they turn the gadgetskill off.,Rainbow6,dfal168,2,t5_2t1bl

11353924,0,t1_dfiocxb,Im not saying he is a bad operator now I think he is still fantastic. I think the reasons for the removal of the ACOG however were a joke  it was people on reddit crying over getting spawn killed by it. But it was no more or less effective than someone using Jagers gun it was just mentioned because it was a secondary weapon that is in effect his primary as we smoke players tend to use the shotgun for map manipulation not for combat in the main. It is the same scenario we face with Montagne now people complained about his weakness and now we have a Shield that is being used to push roamers round a map at the high end of the game one that can withstand  Cs multiple Smoke grenades etc. The problem with balancing the game around casual players is they dont have the experience to determine what does and doesnt affect the overall health of the game shifting metas dramatically for no reason other than they need something to moan about. Smoke was never any more of an issue than Spawn peeking is now at the higher end of the game people dont run around like headless chickens and use drones to mark spawn peekers. If you die to one it is your fault not the fact he was using a SMG with an ACOG.,Rainbow6,dfiy2pz,1,t5_2t1bl

11371403,0,t1_dfkmnbe,Its not really an issue that there arent more DMR using operators. Glazs concept even without the buff is fine. The issue with Glaz right now is that his damage model is flawed and makes him a beast in CQB moreso than at range.The defender meta has shifted towards utility and being able to control more key areas of the map rather than the classic hard holdlonger range engagements of before. As a consequence youre seeing a lot less Rook and as such less survivability. Add to that operators that can push with impunity like MontagneGlaz and killdown in minimal time and it leads to must picks. The Glaz meta isnt helped by so many useful operators having smoke grenades as well as the general inconsistency of the smoke dispersion.Ideally Id like to see the game really embrace its Operator system and balance around the intended role of an operator primarily and only then see what can be done to make them more effective at their role and avoid unintended circumstances. Take Ash for example shes an extremely competent entry fragger due to her speed and weaponry but at the same time is one of the better breachers in the game  why does she have smokes? Far better to switch her gadget options to BreachesStuns to better capitalise on her strengths and then rein her in if shes too much. Apply that to the whole cast and you have a platform to balance from.,Rainbow6,dfkxe8h,2,t5_2t1bl

11396567,0,t1_dfnry9l,How do you roam and how do you rush?Heres a video about pro league roaming by Remorce.Does your roaming focus on peek and time wasting or flank? When I roam I peeked out but not focus on to get a kill. If I do thats a bonus but I want to waste the attackers time. Let them know that Im there and lurking around. If they want to push they have to find me first. If they ignore me then I will work on pushing the flank. Sometime I could just hide and they dont even know that Im roaming then once theyre engaging with my anchor then Ill push from flank and get them from behind.I dont rush as an attackers since my aim is not that good. I rather push slowly either create main push and have my teammate flank or Ill do the flank. I dont like doing one direction push as an attacker.,Rainbow6,dfnsaou,1,t5_2t1bl

If you are Solo then you cant rely on your team to drone for you so droning will take longer  which is your point and one I have already covered. If you are playing in a team you are going to be communicating so droning is far more effective. Most maps take around  seconds to clear with team droning. The reason he isnt picked in pro league is exactly that he is isnt required to get roamers so doesnt bring anything to the table any other attacker would with  drones. ,Rainbow6,dfrpqxn,1,t5_2t1bl

He played passive every other round as far as I remember. They brought that capitao specifically to counter his super static position that they couldnt deal with the previous round. He played fine and anchored site the entire map on border. I feel like this is just the classic blame the bottom frag BS. cTm lost as a team. If anything Canadian and NVK lost oregon for them IMO because they were ineffective on their roams and didnt get enough kills or take enough time off the clock. One of the  rounds they won was in a large part due to Slash playing super passively and Necrox being able to take advantage of the low time as smoke.,Rainbow6,dfsxfo9,40,t5_2t1bl

11451258,0,t3_63go7u,Okay so ive read a lot of these possible operator posts just to see what theyre all about and cause its fun to see who actually has good ideas and brainstorm a little but this is unilaterally and irredeemably the worst set of operators ive ever seen suggested. Operator  Literally twitch but with an exploding droneOperator  Would be useless because you may want to flash  frag to clear a room and end up just laying down smoke. Plus how is it possible for one grenade to have six equally sized grenades inside of it??Operator  Literally thermite but ranged and immobileOperator  Excellent for countering Jackal useless for literally anything else. Caviera already has this ability and shes not a fucking furry either.Operator  Yes its incredibly realistic to carry a massive fucking corpse around with you on a counterterrorism mission and even more realistic to have that corpse magically change to whoever died last. This gadget could easily be countered by simply communicating where you died to the rest of your team. Not to mention i feel like naming it boomboom body should be enough to indicate how shit an idea it is. Operator  Literally Thatcher but he also makes stuff slippery.I hate to be harsh but did you even think these through at all? Did you even consider realism? Name one counterterrorism unit that has anything even remotely close to a massive fucking tail designed specifically and only to counter a fictional tracking device. Name one that carries magical exploding corpses. Name one that brings a fucking pirate cannon into a hostage rescue rather than a breaching charge. Name one that somehow has enough of this magical freezing substance to freeze an entire shipping complex or yacht or house like you said they could do if not for time constraints ingame. Realism aside did you even consider ingame viability? What would be the pickrate for an operator who has to stand directly in front of a wall immobilized and completely exposed in order to breach it? What about someone whose only addition to the match is  personal and ONLY to counter Jackal? What would they do in rounds where Jackal wasnt picked? Who would pick thatcher now that theres another operator identical to him but can also make people slide around? Why would anyone pick twitch when theres another operator who could do everything she can but could also take out half the enemy team in the reinforcement phase in one explosion? Who would pick an operator whose gadget is basically a secondary grenade but you dont actually know which one? How easy would it be to counter an operator whose ability lies  on the idea that the enemy team doesnt pay attention to who died and where they died?TLDR i could have put a disc copy of RS into a blender with some dog food feed it to my labrador and the bloody stool she produced  hours later would be a better operator than any of these. ,Rainbow6,dftzomz,3,t5_2t1bl
11451700,0,t1_dftzzws,See now Im under assumption that YES both are familywise the FN FAL. But i still think they are different guns and should be given different links as such. The CA is a different than the MA.The CA is a variant of the LA SelfLoading Rifle a British Commonwealth derivative of the Belgian FN FAL. the main differences of this variant include a rotating disc rear sight graduated from  to  yards and a twopiece firing pin. The trigger guard was able to be removed from the pistol grip this allowed the user to wear mitts when using the weapon. The Canadian rifle also has a shorter receiver cover than other Commonwealth variants to allow for refilling the magazine by charging it with stripper clips ,Rainbow6,dfu1hos,2,t5_2t1bl

11483642,0,t3_63vkig,I agree with most of the comments on this post that you dont have the right mindset. This is a team based game not individual skill. Rank is based on your ability to win against high ranked players. Having said that. I can see how you feel stuck. If you dont have regular squad mates and you play with random team mates then you are rolling the dice. Once you are placed in cooper ranked it can seem like a hole you can never climb out of because you wont find a proper random team until you start matchmaking with platinum players. I would hate to constantly be matched with cooper players that are clueless and probably lack maturity ,Rainbow6,dfxo3bo,1,t5_2t1bl

11510830,0,t1_dg0qw0w,I mean you knew what you are doing is bad yet you felt the urge to tell people about it. Unless I am completely mistaken this might be a sliver of a bad conscience. So not everything is lost yet.I dont know if you play casual or ranked but do you know what determines the rank of a player whether he is copper or diamond? The ratio of won games. Do you know what isnt even considered in this? His KD or how often he is MVP. Its completely irrelevant because its only a poor way to determine how good a player actually is. The only reliable way to find it out is how often he manages to influence the outcome of a round. And if it is a Montagne player for example who perfectly shields his buddies and gets them easy wins every time what do you think how many points will he make droning or killing people? Does this mean he doesnt deserve Montagne.I think its time for you guys to grow up a bit in terms of MVP.Edit I just have to think of this round in pro leagueRook didnt kill anybody and got killed in the end however he still delayed the attack so far that they ran out of time. Kixstar even attributes the round to Rook at the end. Id like to see a point system being able to recognize that as well.,Rainbow6,dg0r5v8,1,t5_2t1bl

If youve been playing the game for a while you should know where the common spawn peek spots are. Usually you can see the spawn peek coming from a mile away if you just position your drone in a place where you can see the defenders setting up for it. So many people I play with while Solo queuing WASTE their drones when theyre quite possible one of your most important assets as an attacker. I see so many people getting slaughtered because they enter rooms not knowing whats coming in front of them. Then they complain about the game like its not their own fault.There are much wiser ways to use your drone other than to spam scan the defenders just to get MVP at the end of the round.,Rainbow6,dg1y6x8,18,t5_2t1bl

11625860,0,t1_dgdse5w,You admit that hes not viable and somehow say that hes balanced. The gun did not reliably one shot because its damage dropoff is so short and having a gun that downs isnt unique in any way. You can kill faster with the F RC Vector and just about any gun with high fire rate and decent damage. You can destroy Castle barricades with Sledge Ash frag grenades breach charges and they dont waste your own limited ammo supply. Glaz had absolutely nothing worth picking over other attackers besides Blitz and thats only because his hitboxes are busted. His gadget is just an ACOG with red tint. It doesnt even have higher magnification to justify being a so called sniperdesignated marksman. You might as well remove him from the game if you want to revert him because no one used him seriously since he had nothing to offer other than niche fun for a handful of players. Hes just a funtroll pick ala Tachanka before his last update. ,Rainbow6,dgdsxdp,1,t5_2t1bl

He played against Kix with a full team with communication and Kix was streaming mostly reading chat and with randoms Sergio won and uploaded the match making it seem as though it was an epic game when in fact Kix was reading chat half the time and Sergio just jumps out of a window with shotgun pulse. He did the same with Panky as well.. Back when Pulse and Blackbeard were OP he literally only used those ops and abused them so hard it was stupid..

They hear us out in a way or another. There are tems developing the game and the DLCs they develop them we dont.

11723362,0,t1_dgomja0,Did you ever stop to think you are speaking from the same confirmation bias? You are speaking from your experience and in your experience run outs might usually result in a kill but in others it almost never happens to them and their team. The team I play with has adapted an instant defensive strategy on spawn reach nearest cover and check exterior windows immediately off spawn. By making it something we are expecting every round we have dramatically reduced the amount of roundopening picks against our team. Its not that hard to counter peeks and rushes you just need to know where they come from and not walk into them. It will still happen inevitably but some of this community makes way too big a deal out of the situation. ,Rainbow6,dgovg6g,3,t5_2t1bl

The person who left could take a full loss but those remaining could get their loss adjusted based on percentage. I dont like the idea of a big adjustment or the idea of a loss just not counting but this is a decent idea and thered be no point to attempting to abuse it. The leaver would just take a big hit while the rest of the team would suffer slightly less and overall it just seems like attempting to abuse it would leave your group just as bad off in terms of matchmaking or close enough as makes no difference.,Rainbow6,dgpfct3,1,t5_2t1bl

I dont actually give a damn about reddit karma so i am not here whining about missing the  challenges. i only did some math and thought how nice it would be to have that much extra with out doing almost nothing. You cant say that you would not be a little bit pissed if someone told you irl that you would get  year of free gasoline for a car if you just drove back to the shop where you bought a new car from but when you would go there the first time they would just say that its only  cheaper for you.,Rainbow6,dgtj20h,1,t5_2t1bl

11783998,0,t3_6829es,I have friends who dont have the best of mics. One uses the PS given mic and the other has Apple headphones. the two other have the good headsets like I do. The one with the PS mic doesnt really care about the game so he doesnt listen very well as well as him having a lot of background noise plus his mic is super loud. The other doesnt really talk and when he does its hard to hear with the apple headphone mic. Plus whenever they die they just start yelling and play videos or music and it makes  it hard for me to hear any footsteps or game sounds. Wish Playstation would allow the option for sliders to lower or make other louder. Edit  Spellings,Rainbow6,dgvr6b8,1,t5_2t1bl
