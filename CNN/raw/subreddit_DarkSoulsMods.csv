932968,1,t3_24srzq,This is what you get for using ENB. It doesnt even look good and it ruins the game.Theres specific enemies you can farm for torches like the torch hollows.,DarkSoulsMods,chac079,-1,t5_2v0wz
1122873,0,t3_26y4qa,As mentioned no VAC currently. But I also read up a bit and apparently Valve does a little bit of research before handing out Vac bans anyway... Because technically things like Fraps can set off alarms in VAC. One of the reasons everyone loves Valve so much is because they know what gamers want and respect their wishes so long as their wants dont negatively impact the rest of the community... i.e. cheating.,DarkSoulsMods,chvxjeq,1,t5_2v0wz

2770185,0,t3_2q1uom,If youve had no luck with both picking a download region all to yourselves Ive read elsewhere that if you set up hamachi and set your download region to LAN youre borderline guaranteed to see your friends sign with ease.The downside is that whereas picking a remote not Finland dl region makes you unlikely to have outsiders hamachi gives you zero chance at all but Ill certainly try that to see if it makes organised co op possible.,DarkSoulsMods,cniyk9y,1,t5_2v0wz

4447650,0,t3_3bwz9z,iirc two people with the debug build can play online together. however i know for a fact that debug users are cut off from normal ones. theres no real incentive to play online using the debug build anyway unless youre testing something ,DarkSoulsMods,csrb8yb,1,t5_2v0wz
5892143,0,t1_cxrraea,Well like I mentioned the tool isnt properly injecting the .ini configuration file into the game. What I want is simply to downscale some resolutions. Game doesnt crash the ini settings simply dont take effect.,DarkSoulsMods,cxrzstz,1,t5_2v0wz

7140348,0,t1_d1pqbou,well someone said that the death counter in majula indicates if you are softbanned or not and if this is true well im not softbanned even tho im running around with custom spells modified movesets etc in pvp for weeks,DarkSoulsMods,d1ps43x,1,t5_2v0wz
7820619,0,t3_4mdst3,no and it will likely remain that way for the foreseeable future. it is possible to implement such a feature but i dont see it happening  i believe the creator is currently working on dark souls  stuff and doesnt plan on adding support for non dark souls  games for dsmodt anyway,DarkSoulsMods,d3v3pw5,1,t5_2v0wz

11733530,0,t1_dgpjox1,Would make sense but I dont really have any experience with this kind of stuff other than the changing name thing. All I know is that if you hack items in that shouldnt be in the game like a  weapon or an upgraded weapon that shouldnt be upgraded or anything else youll still get banned if you have it in your inventory. I would probably just recommend asking somewhere else P,DarkSoulsMods,dgq0xgl,1,t5_2v0wz
