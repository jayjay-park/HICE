2774912,0,t3_2rt4a9,I tried using something called Booklet Creator I only have the free version which allows you to work with one  page block at a time and converts a pdf document into a printable signature. It was tedious to do a whole book using the free version but it was serviceable for an experimental project. Im assuming the paid version might work a little more smoothly.,bookbinding,cnjhwel,3,t5_2smpy

4789554,0,t1_cty62wv,This instructables is what I used. Modern hardcovers and paperbacks are both just pages glued together the only difference is hardcovers are usually glued in signatures whereas paperbacks are just single pages. So youre pretty much just as likely to lose pages from either youll just lose them in larger chunks if your hardcover deteriorates. The major difference for longevity is that most hardcovers use acidfree paper but most paperbacks dont and while therefore brown over time.,bookbinding,cty9g81,2,t5_2smpy

7650099,0,t1_d3b4i40,Thats not the hard part in my experience.  Stories have power and people get very attached to a books content.  It has deep emotional meaning to them and having a beautifully handcrafted version of something that means so much to them is an easy sell.The hard part is getting those books down to a price that people can afford.  They want leather and gold and really complex designs.  They want the book to look as grand as the scope of the story is in their head.  Price and craftsmanship have been at odds since the industrial revolution.  If you can strike a balance and get noticed then youll be drowning in commissions.,bookbinding,d3brv9n,2,t5_2smpy

7966409,0,t3_4obk5q,If he is looking to rewrite the final version I would do one of two things. Buy a good reputation archival quality notebook and good quality ink pen think Sakura etc.  You wouldnt need to bind anything then and there are some REALLY high quality notebooks out nowadays.Or my first preference would be Have him write on loose pages of lined paper not loose leaf with the holes but a good high quality bright white paper and then have it scanned and reprinted.  Keep the original stored safely and print the scanned version on a high quality acid free cotton or cotton blend paper.  Then you can bind the copy and give it a nice leather hard bound cover.Regardless I would personally struggle with binding the original because Im not at a stage where I could guarantee not to f it up.Best of luck!Edit Another benefit of  is that if he would make a mistake since he is handwriting it he would only have to rewrite that one page since you will be scanning and printing to signatures later in the process.  A lot easier than scrapping an entire signature or leaving unsightly mistakes in a final version.  Hes worked hard on it and it would be nice for him to have a final version he can be proud of.ps  Im jealous that youll get to work on something with such great meaning to you!,bookbinding,d4bi0a0,3,t5_2smpy

8795656,0,t1_d74ltvt,Thank you for the wonderful and detailed response! Im going to look into buying a block of polyester and testing it out on another book before making the real one.I hadnt even thought about what effect the heat would have on vinyl! Im glad you brought that up!I have a bad shelf that I could probably recycle so that works out perfectly. Seriously thanks! Youre awesome! ,bookbinding,d754a0b,1,t5_2smpy
9102586,0,t3_54uidi,I work in conservation also at a library and applaud your desire to rebuildrebindrestore. Ive fixed a few of my kids board books but the fact is that these are made to be hardy so whatever you do if they get the same use theyll probably fall apart again. I say that not to discourage you but to encourage experimentation and come up with your own solution that suits your time and passion! Id be interested in what you experiment with. ,bookbinding,d85zgt8,1,t5_2smpy

10902311,0,t3_5rpqjl,Does anyone know where I could get this book restored? Everyone Ive asked has told me that it will need a new binding but that it wont have any of the inscriptions etc. on it. Im fine with paying the extra amount but I dont want it to be a completely different cover that looks nothing like the original and I want the pages cleaned since Ive heard you can do that. Can anyone please PM me a recommendation for this?Heres a link of the books condition if it helps. Im located in the US.,bookbinding,de4hv1p,1,t5_2smpy
11137160,0,t3_5yzm29,It may be a perfect binding  that is glue only. You cant tell from the bundles of leaves. Some glue bindings use page bundles and from the spine they look like a sewn binding but they are not.,bookbinding,deudwki,4,t5_2smpy
11699004,0,t1_dgm092g,There is often a thing like that at the top but nowadays its only for decoration and serves no real purpose.  Your book is fine.  Enjoy!,bookbinding,dgm3mw3,3,t5_2smpy
11769733,0,t1_dgu32rd,Thank you.  I will call and talk to them their site is not so great...  I dont do enough books a year to justify a machine for  unique books a day but it is a time consuming process to bind a nice book.  I am just starting my business now and that part of my process is time consuming.  I see some affordable Chinese hot melt case making systems but I am selling a high quality product and need it to use jade PVA glue buckram or similar as I want my product to last multiple lifetimes.  There isnt much in the way of automation for that kind of product at all much less reasonably priced.  Heres to hoping I will be able to afford one someday...,bookbinding,dgu4p96,1,t5_2smpy
