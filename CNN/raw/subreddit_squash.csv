Prince over grips are also decent but I would recommend the Karakai.  I employ similar measures in regards to sweaty palms and have found they greatly improve my game striking the ball tightness etc.  it is quite remarkable how much sweaty hands and a worn out grip will hamper your shot.Edit.

1648275,0,t3_2d6kjf,We use an individual system in which about  players participate. You play  game per week in cycles of two weeks. So on monday of week  I get an email telling me who the play the upcoming weeks. I enter the result on a web page and rise or decline on the score board. Lets say I am number  in the list. And I am to play the number  and the number . If I win from  nothing happens since is I am above him. If I lose from  nothing happens either since he is above me. The next round I will most likely keep the th postion could change a bit though if a new player enters or some drops outIf I lose from  I get a  score   If I win from  I get a  score  In total a than have a  score. Most likely in the next round I will rise to position . There is a big algorithm behind it that keeps you from playing the same people over and over it also keeps tracks your previous results.

1686288,0,t1_cjr50br,As a guy whos only been playing for around  years this is incredibly true. When i began to play we started out with the double yellow. We could play sure but drop shots and corner shots were just kill shots for us since neither of us could hit hard enough or retrieve enough for the ball to get warm. It made for a weird game with very short rallies.After a while we tried a red ball  this was much much more fun you could actually pick up a drop shot or catch a ball in the corner due to more bounce. I think we played this for maybe  months as we learned.Only then did we move to the single and double yellows.,squash,cjrpyul,1,t5_2qs3d

Jonathon Power aside there seems to be a dearth of genuinely worldclass players coming from that part of the world. What are the main reasons for this? I mean from my outsider point of view the major colleges seem to have excellent squash facilities as well as top coaches but aside from a few players hovering around the top  Im talking more on the mens rankings here Id need to look more at the ladies rankings there doesnt seem to be anyone threatening to break through.

3188373,0,t3_2wnbnb,I cant read either site but the things I look for in a racket are weight head shape and balance. Weight is all personal preference. Head shape and balance come down to what type of player you are. A rounder head will give you more ball feel while a teardrop head will have a larger power zone and will help you hit the ball harder. A head heavy racket is better for a power game while a handle heavy racket will give you better ball feel. For my game I play with a g teardrop racket that is balanced. I also string my rackets to have a medium tension. It gives me great ball feel while still letting me go out and mash the ball if need be. ,squash,cosh3tf,2,t5_2qs3d

Their tennis follow through inability to distinguish a let or stroke and general bad sportsmanship.  I learned my lesson after solo practicing and being asked if Id like to hit... well hit I got right in the ear with a wild swing.

I meant a lowmedium pace shot about waist height.For me its a huge control shot and the only thing that matters is placement of the bounce.Basically youre in the corner hes cheated off the T and come in behind you waiting for the long ball to the back wall.  You wind up for a long drive along the wall but right as youre about to hit it you slow the racquet speed and ball pace drops from high to slowmedium. The short bounce in the front court will have him scrambled.  The obvious is probably just as effective tho which is a short ball but then you run the risk of a let because basically as soon as youve hit it hell be charging right into you and any contact could be construed as blockage...,squash,cumpxwn,1,t5_2qs3d

I switched to a head heavy racquet and I hit the ball a lot straighter and tighter and I have more control with my drop shots.

6720633,0,t3_47mgq8,The most important part of being consistent within a game is to forget everything else.  Forget the expectations going in forget the poor shots forget the frustration even forget the score.Once youve forgotten everything what do you think about?  You think about the next shot and the next rally.If youre struggling to hit the ball deep its probably because you arent moving your feet so tell yourself to move away from the ball and then step into the shot.  Tell yourself to hit it higher on the front wall to get it deeper with less effort and less risk.Tell yourself to get to the T and watch the ball.  Tell yourself to anticipate the next shot.  If your opponent has a pattern of play or  such as constant drops and boasts work out where you need to go to combat that pattern.Tell yourself to think about his weakness not your own.  In a game we often think about how were making mistakes and focus on that which removes all the pressure from the opponent.  You have to think about what you can do to put the pressure on them.  If that means attacking the front of court from the start of the rally then do so.Then you play the rally.  If it goes well then enjoy the satisfaction of that and think about the next rally.  If it goes poorly learn the lesson of what went wrong then think about the next rally.I posted this the other day but it equally applies hereYour standard is defined by your worst games.  Your current potential is defined by your best games.What that means is that just because you have beaten people doesnt mean that you should beat them again.  In fact you should take confidence from having performed at that level but remember that you have to work to maintain that level.  Consistency is king.Outside of game situations you need to work on technique and movement in a drill session probably at least one per week.  Most social and lower level player never do this and its why they cant perform under pressure as they have nothing to rely on.  Until you have a foundation to base your game on youll be trying to reinvent the wheel on court.  Drills will imprint the actions you need to repeat into your muscle memory leaving you to think about other things during the matches.,squash,d0egzgf,5,t5_2qs3d

I will not longer be supporting xamsa hopefully its just a bad batch of racquets since I want to see canadian companies do well.,squash,d90gjb0,1,t5_2qs3d
9464113,0,t1_d9fm0w2,I was trying for more than  minutes.. after trying for  more minutes on the backhand side. So there was some relief there ,squash,d9fn5ob,2,t5_2qs3d
9484189,0,t3_5ai3cr,There will be a point where you can walk without pain.  Youll feel that youre healed ready to play.You wont be.  Youll go on court and itll be mostly fine then bam it goes again.Double the time from injured to walking before playing. ,squash,d9i4p2t,2,t5_2qs3d

9501441,0,t1_d9imvzz,They have support I guess you mean the cushioning in the back for the heel. The front is less cushioned in order to lose less power when accelerating since the contact to the floor is more direct. ,squash,d9k976r,1,t5_2qs3d
9503567,0,t1_d9k1v2l,Arrogant kids out of Egypt? Thats a little unfair. There was a post about Jonathan Powers the other day and how good he was but personally i find his games unwatchable with all his shenanigans. Gaultier and Nick Matthew are also guilty of playing the man not the ball a lot. ,squash,d9kimng,2,t5_2qs3d

9600362,0,t1_d9wftqs,I know a few guys who will put their foot on it and roll it on the carpet outside the court. Im not a fan of that seems like a waste of energy plus it ruins the ball. ,squash,d9wfvpu,3,t5_2qs3d
9619964,0,t1_d9yfbkl,Sometimes it is difficult to volley straight and much easier to lob the ball back over the other side almost as though you are hitting a serve in reverse.  Im teaching a friend to play. We do a drill where we volley high and soft back and forth each standing around one of the service boxes. The drill seems to have helped her figure out that she needs either move her feet to get in a better striking position or strike the ball in a way that reflects her current position. And she is now pretty good at lobbing a serve back across the court into the back corners. Perhaps too good...,squash,d9yux1u,1,t5_2qs3d
9729442,0,t1_daccz7a,On the other hand if Fathi had stopped and asked for a let he probably wouldnt have been given a stroke. This means that Coleman would actually be rewarded by reducing the number of options Fathi has to play. Knowing the crosscourt isnt available lets him be much quicker to react on the other options.So on one hand yeah giving a stroke for dangerous play is really not great but on the other hand I cringe every time I see players denied a shot because the opponent hasnt cleared totally.,squash,dacd7ba,16,t5_2qs3d
9801041,0,t1_dakgkg4,I actually disagree somewhat. Im with you that you cannot possibly get better without muscle memory training of certain movements such as the volley and you will get a bit stronger by simply playing and doing drills over and over but its been proven in every sport squash included weightstrength training makes you stronger and faster and gives you more endurance while doing so. In squash if you were to do strength training supplementing your volley drills your racket prep will be faster your movement will be faster your endurance will go up and everything will feel easier.TLDR Strength training will not replace volley drills but they will improve your efficiency quickness and ease of hitting them overall.,squash,dal6tvu,3,t5_2qs3d
9821996,0,t1_danpdc2,well they probably all know the rules well enough anyway.  Its more at lower league levels that I find that requiring players to ref brings additional benefits.,squash,dantqdk,1,t5_2qs3d

9973445,0,t3_5iegs5,Dont be afraid of losing. If youre  up and you think If I lost now that would be awful just remind yourself that in the grand scheme of things it doesnt matter if you lose so theres no point worrying about it. Just play every point as if it doesnt make a difference whether you win or lose and you will be much more relaxed and play better for it. Enjoy the ride and stop thinking about the destination.,squash,db7kfcb,1,t5_2qs3d
10185795,0,t3_5luimt,I think g is fine particularly as youve said for a big guy like yourself thatll be no problem.That said I think g or around there is the sweet spot for racket weight. So once youve got back into it and youve hitting the ball nice and cleanly Id then consider looking into another racket...untill that point dont bother.,squash,dbym6vh,-3,t5_2qs3d

10574072,0,t1_dd6jxto,Id assume backhand serve where the ball hits the wall near the back off the serve box. I have seen many struggle with this. I do too sometimes. Many try to hit the ball where it hits the wall. I could be wrong too.,squash,dd6msf0,1,t5_2qs3d

11284899,0,t1_dfa294w,Agree.  Youll notice that even pros and very good players most often hit simple straight length...a shot tight and deep is the best shot in squash and achievable by anyone though more consistently by better players.  Do what you can and try to keep him in the corners.,squash,dfb4kic,1,t5_2qs3d

11400284,0,t1_df9hpuw,You are spot on with this comment. Its really frustrating to me watching  of the squash community basically playing dead ball. And yet players are almost universally deeply opposed to anything other than the double dot. Its insane.,squash,dfo7hn0,1,t5_2qs3d
11538113,0,t1_dg3uaku,gt The rule is that the bag is an extension of the tin correct? Not exactly the rule is that if the ball hits anything on court belonging to a player that player loses the point.So for example if your drop hits the opponents bag HE would lose the point even if he could have returned your drop.Dont worry about playing Lets it is probably okay most of the time. However I would suggest that the point should go to the player who hit the last shot if it looks like the shot would have been a winnerthis way at club level fair play is assured.,squash,dg3uil4,1,t5_2qs3d
