7785505,0,t3_4lwfyz,Hello my dawg . I have been to a number of festivals and never hadseenheard of that happening to anyone seems like someone you know is more likely to do that then an absolute stranger. Register your band  in case this does happen will call gots your back. Here are some tips leave enough room for a thumb to fit between your band and your wrist. Grab the left over slack and tuck it in side the the band looping around it.  Dancing using your right hand wristband side will detour douches not many in SAMF. . The surrounding perimeter will have security guiding people away from the fence as well as watching for fence jumpers.,SpringAwakening,d3r5aaw,1,t5_2tii4

10916310,0,t3_5vyhkk,I understand where youre coming from but you have to consider the fact that most people have not had the chance to experience the big names like yourself. The EDM scene keeps on growing every year which means new listener are interested in the genre. I myself have been in the EDM scene for  years yet I have not seen like  of the artists on the lineup. Also there are many international people that dont get the chance their favorite big name artists. Furthermore its a business strategy. In order to increase the number of people that will attend the festival they have to give them the DJs that are the best in the business. Martin Garrix AVB Alesso Melo etc are all examples of artists that appeal to the general audience. Finally Im sure SAMF will add more DJs to the lineup that you have not seen so I wouldnt give up hope. ,SpringAwakening,de5xuy5,7,t5_2tii4
