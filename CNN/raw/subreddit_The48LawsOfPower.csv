Id be willing to bet that there are women today who think Bill Cosby is suddenly sexier because of the rape allegations.Of course nobodys going to say that in public... but TRP knows better.Finally dont get hung up on absolutes.

2578206,0,t1_cmv3xc0,gtthat features attention as a reward is going to work these days.Its exacerbated further by two underlying components Feminism bred women to be collectively narcissistic and take on a Im the prize mentality. Combine that with their inherent neediness and effeminate men pedestalising them and giving them attention out the ass and on tap and you get huge attention whores. Baby boomers neglected their kids andor gave them only a single parent to live with so feeling attention deprived people look for attention from friendshipsrelationships to a more pronounced degree than they used to to compensate. When you have two parents attention can be distributed more evenly and the child is less likely to end up neglected as a result. A parent cant work and fulfil their childs attentive needs at the same time.gtInstagram. Long ago you shared photos with the people in your life. Instagram allowed people to create their own mini cultlike following by letting people share photos with others who dont know them. What they are selling is envy.You are bang on with that. Sometimes I go on instagram to observe overt narcissism.  cents is particularly narcissistic. MY SNEAKERS MATCH MY LAMBO U AINT ON THIS LEVEL he posted something akin to that awhile back.But then when you realise  Cents mother died when he was  he never knew his dad and he was raised by what I presume are now dead grandparents it makes a lot of sense. A hell of a lot of sense.,The48LawsOfPower,cmv3yge,1,t5_34km0
3585154,0,t1_coxt23p,Man you have read a lot. I also like to reread The Prince from time to time.About making money. I dont know if I can give you some recs it seems you already know your stuff. And from what you write I dont know if you already run businesses or not. What I think is that the topic cannot be boxed and separated. It is really an aggregation of things. For instance suppose this scenario you start your first business you are creating a new product physical or digital whatever and for some reason you believe you can do it without giving ownership. At some point you need people with technical knowledge to help you build your product. How can you manipulate them to work for you without giving them ownership and without giving them money? It is doable of course but every instance of the game is different from another one you must adapt you know that. I dont know if I can use this terminology but if you are a shark it is easy to spot the clueless dolphin that strive for guidance. You just need to give them what they want. It is all correlated. Games of power are everywhere at any moment. The guard cannot ever fall.What I recommend is to acquire as much knowledge as possible. Depend as little as possible on others. Know to understand what people want without the need for asking them. You set yourself your own objectives then books actually the reading and retention process are only tools to achieve your objectives. You may need years or months but knowing what you want to have will lead you.To make money there is no other way that owning companies. How you do it is where the game is played. The business idea could not even be yours. You just need to be not replaceable. Never trust anybody especially when it comes to money. But make them think you trust them and watch out for their mistakes. You surely know how to make them relaxed in your presence they eventually will make some mistakes you exploit this. Who are they? Everyone who has the power to take some of your power. Potentially everyone.About the actual business production. Strive for monopolies. What is an excellent investment? To see what nobody else can see. To see a CocaCola like company when it is still in its early days. You either build a monopoly or at least something that could resemble a monopoly or you strive to acquire it in some ways. When they say successful people pay a lot of attention to tiny details it really just means they strive to control everything. But this control attitude cannot be learned. What else. It is true that you will work twelvefourteen hours a day for weeks or months never stopping. But it is easy to do it since you know the power you will gain. And we know that it is all about power and control.You asked for recs but seeing the way you write I believe you dont need my recsadvices and that you can find what you need doing your searches but I am well open to cooperate.Have you read Sparkman? Good stories in that book.P.S.

You?I actually created a subreddit for likeminded people so check out rliveunplugged. Its for people like us to discuss how to use our skills to soar in the world and simply to improve our lifestyle and quality of life.And I suppose I can see how we are assholes but then again EVERYONE IS FUCKING SELFISH. So EVERYONE IS AN ASSHOLE ANYWAY. So I feel like they have no right to judge.gt They would speak their mind freely without caring for others emotionsYeah fair enough. One of the lessons Im actively trying to practice from the Book is to use Selective HonestyGenorisity to disarm people. Tell the insecure what they want to hear compliment them even if its not true feed them the lies they want to hear and they will love you for it. Its what Im actively practicing this month.gtSociety calls such men assholes.Again Id rather be told the blunt truth and respect the person than being fed lies. On any day Id think the liar is the real asshole. Hes fake. Hes inauthentic. Hes a fool and a coward for not telling the truth because he fears that he may be responsible for me being upset or whatever rationale heshe has.,The48LawsOfPower,cx8vj56,1,t5_34km0

Better to be AttackedSlandered Than Ignored.It is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar appearance of yours should not be controversial that to be attacked is somehow bad.
