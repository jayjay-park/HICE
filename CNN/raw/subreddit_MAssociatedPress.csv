11501000,0,t1_dfz6h98,Because Breitbart usually doesnt write communist or marxist articles or comparative art analysis but in the sim they do.AP isnt a regular news platform they are  newspapers in addition to more than  television and radio broadcasters operating in  news bureaus hence the name. In the sim this obviously isnt the case. The ModelAP is governed like a regular news paper with a President VP and COO which is why I took the liberty of writing opinion pieces which also passed an editor.This also isnt  the first time the mAP wrote an op ed as a matter of fact they were already writing op eds before I joined the team so perhaps your quarrel is slightly belated or misguided.,MAssociatedPress,dfzmzlh,2,t5_3j1dr
