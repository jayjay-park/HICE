11179409,0,t3_5ydezd,Another week another RCPW event. This week we find ourselves deep with the bowls of whichever locations arena is hosting tonights showing of Fury. Time wise we are preparing for the match between Michael Ritchie and Kade. A match that seems to have a lot riding on it. Back on the current happenings we find ourselves in an empty room that is poorly lit. Partially visible is a pedestal with something slightly shimmering on it. Slowly the lighting improves revealing the object to be Kades skull crown for those who seem confused by this think what HHH usually wears at Wrestlemania when he makes his entrance. sat on a little cushion pouring smoke out from underneath itself. The silence is then broken by a voice.Time is drawing near. The curtain is getting ready to close on the opening part of the play. Preparations being made in the wings to set up for the finale. A finale of grand proportions. Tonight the final act is going to be made known. Who will be victorious over their foes and prepare to face the final villains... or protagonists... of the grand idea of one Lucas Rhodes.Stepping out from the shadows is the tattooed figure of Kade. Wearing as always his usual wrestling gear. The tights the belt the elbow pad the tapped wrists. Also tonight he has his entrance jacket on. Maybe its a little chilly in the room. Dry ice effects can b I mean smoke could be cold. Yes smoke... ltltHow do things look for the jester? Will the playful participant make it through to the final curtain call? What will become of him if he does not?Ladies and gentlemen fear not for I am not going to be leaving this tournament yet. One man stands between me and advancing to the final act Michael Ritchie. Although I hear that there is some technicality of that tshirt fellow having the potential of beating me to the punch. I cant see it happening personally. Fortune has never really smiled on the stupid. Tonight is all about the smoke spectre slipping out of the mists and taking the RCPW competition by storm. Sweeping everyone aside without the slightest bit of effort. Then advancing into the finals and getting closer to being the top man in this company. The RCPW. World. Heavyweight. Champion.Taking a side step out of shot Kade slowly descends from the top of the screen. Almost like a bat hanging from the roof. Little strange but Im sure people are used to this by now.Could it happen? The Phantom... World champion. Will anyone feel aggrieved about this happen stance? I know one man who might. The one who seems to feel he already owns this company and has no competition. Who is this man?Kade slides out of shot again before poking the top half of his head out from behind the pedestal.Well... Im not telling.Standing up and holding his arms out in that praise me kind of pose.Spoiling the final act wouldnt be fair would it? If you wish to know how things play out you had just better keep watching as events unfold.Tonight will see me crush a man who is yet to even get a victory at a show. I shall advance into the finals of the tournament where the real show begins. The ratings will spike and you will not be disappointed. The reviews will rave about the talents Rhodes has hired and the five star performances being shown. Pure talent. The last four surviving men even worth writing about. One man standing tall at the end. The fat lady is preparing to sing but all that will come out... is smoke.Kade picks up the crown and places it on his head. He begins to walk off screen but halfway out of shot he seems to hesitate. He leans back and looks back into the camera.Some say cloverleafs are lucky. But tonight just to be safe Ill show you that not all of them are Ritchie. Not all of them are.Kade chuckles and vanishes from shot as the screen goes black.One. Two. Kade is coming... for... you...,RPCW,dez695v,2,t5_3i17w
