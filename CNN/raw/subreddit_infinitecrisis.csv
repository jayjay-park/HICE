526118,0,t3_203i9d,I took a break from IC for about a month and I have to say Im pretty impressed with the game play now that I have come back.  It feels a lot smoother there is less lag and Im not sure if there were updates allowing better graphics on lower end systems but the look feels a lot more polished as well.I really like the champs and how you can build them in different ways for different playstyles.  I hate how some games claim to not enforce a meta but then make the champs so that they are only viable if played in a certain role with a certain build.There are minor things that need to be worked on.  I feel like the way minions group up makes it difficult to last hit some times and the aggro heavily favors ranged champs right now.,infinitecrisis,cg02qdt,2,t5_2w3if

I suggest going on to the forums or going directly to customer support to let Turbine know you would be interested in a OCEAus server. I dont believe in a specific meta. Just play what your team needs. i.e. I dont have an enforcer. I should play enforcer. The developers have stated that currently they are working with new champions as their priority but it probably should be the most recognizable and wellknown characters first so the characters you mentioned could be a maybe.,infinitecrisis,ci77mal,1,t5_2w3if

2336150,0,t3_2m1wwu,GH players! I hope you are enjoying your time on GD. I hope you guys are most importantly having fun and willing to provide quality feedback even if you dont agree with this current systemevent. I wanted to offer a simple tip that you guys should know better than most GD players that will increase your win percentage.To carry GD solo queue you must be extremely objective focused. Again GH players are used to scoping out what objective should have maximum impact on a game turning the tides as they say. For example the first time I saw KoH dominate brawl in KoTC I knew that their advantage came from strictly rotational plays around capture points. In GD it is all about killing towersraidersleviathan. Think of every tower like  points for the enemy team. You want to get that global gold and exp for your team to safely snowball. In the same vein you can splitpush and take towers to even out a bad teamfight. Ive won many games just ignoring teamfights and killing towers providing pressure and disappearing when enemies close in.That brings me to my next point. You cant just yolo into towers. I know you are used to just threaten capture points by walking onto them but here towers hurt alot. The easiest answer is to push the wave and do a joint attack with your drones. Let the drones which are relatively stronger here as well just do work on the towers. Kill the minions for gold. Getting gold as fast as you can follows the same vein as killing towers to boost up your team which brings me to my final point.GD has the advantage and disadvantage of being extremely power spiky. Since the game is comparatively slower good players will take steps to accumulate gold through CS or objectives and use that gold lead to get items and bully other people. Therefore since Ive revealed all of the secrets to easy gold gain and not everyone goes to reddit you now have the tools to succeed on GD over lesser mortals who haventwont read this post. Incidently the ability to carry games using both laningmechanical skill is why I choose to play the  lane map P but this isnt the time and place for that discussionSo in closing I would like to welcome you to GD. I have seen some really great stuff from people I dont usually see on GD dycer Im looking at your starro. Even if you strongly dislike GD I recommend you play  games so you can at least tell based Turbine WHY you hate GD. And who can blame you? Youve already sat through my morning rambling. Thank you and see you on GD! Feel free to add me in game FKTPearee if you have any questions.,infinitecrisis,cm0glp1,5,t5_2w3if

Even after I had come into the room many members of this community who I dearly respect continued not to follow my advice or instructions as I was attempting to settle the room down and make sense of the situation. That will not do for our community and it is a violation of the Protectors Pledge and Community Guidelines. All of us here in Infinite Crisis are better than that.If there is ever a situation where you believe a punishment has been inappropriately assigned please dont continue to make matters worse by trolling the chat creating alternate accounts to bypass the bans or harassing the moderation staff and in some cases me.  Instead message me on the official forums with a PM or grab me in skype if you have me and I will be happy to help you out.As Ive proven tonight I will drop what Im doing and personally investigate a situation.Now to continue there were some cases were punishments did go too far. Let me issue an apology on behalf of myself and all of the moderation staff. Thats not how we want the channel to be. I will be investigating all of the bans tonight to make sure that no one has been banned inappropriately. For those of you who I banned you will be let back into the channel after you have messaged me and had a discussion with me.To fix this for the future I will be writing up rules for the Twitch chat that will be posted to the public in the channel description. The moderators will be asked to uphold those rules as written and chatters will be required to abide by those rules. If you have questions on the rules after they are posted you may contact me and we can discuss.And again if you believe that you received a punishment in error this evening PM me on the official forums and Ill be happy to investigate and talk with you. If you cant grab me grab Afista too. The community team is here to help you after all and both of us are super happy to help and work things through.If anyone has any questions about any of this please let me know.

4211420,0,t3_38zz1y,I think they did really well with balance for the most part. I come from League of Legends where every new champion has all types of crowd control and two mobility spells plus a stolen power type thing that is essentially a blink. I really will miss IC. Had a lot of potential. Wonder why they had to close down shop so early?,infinitecrisis,cs0aef6,1,t5_2w3if

5725590,0,t3_3tgalg,I think the thing I liked most about IC was that it was quite forgiving or at least it was early game. It allowed players the chance to learn as they played about each characters strength and ability without making them pay dramatically via a death each time. It also was also heavily dependent on communication and a collective effort which I prefered over the more individual effort MOBAs meaning one player can just win it themselves given enough time. Plus Superheros and their respective Villains whats not to love?RIP IC,infinitecrisis,cx6td0z,1,t5_2w3if
