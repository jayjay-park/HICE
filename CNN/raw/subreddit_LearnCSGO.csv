11660486,0,t3_66cja8,First of all Ill link to this thread I posted a while ago  not all of the info is relevant to your specific question but quite a bit is directly appliccable and all of it is going to help you. gtIll start with the p. The main problem with the p is its fire rate and its moving accuracy. Say somebody is defending long doors with a p. The second you walk through the door they are weaving back and forth making them incredibly hard to hit and have such a high fire rate they kill you half a second. Even at medium ranges I cant hit them. How do you hit somebody who is jumping around crouching spamming and running all with pinpoint accuracy? I dont know how to deal with it at all.About the long A thing you can use grenades especially molotovs to flush them out. If somebody likes sitting here you can throw a molotov like this and itll start burning them to death. Then just pose up and wreck them while theyre trying to jump away in panic. You can abuse map timings on this specific peek because you as a T are at the doors when the CT is at the corner on long A so you could rush to the door at the start of the round and get a quick kill while the CT tries to run up to the doors since you said you play in Silver theres almost no chance the CTs know how to shut you down. Now another alternative would obviously be to just not go where the P player is. If you know theres a P player going long A every single round and you know you cant beat him stop challenging him. Take contorl of something else instead like short to cat or do a B split How to smoke CT spawn About the aiming you can practice on maps like aimbotz many aim maps have ADADsettings. You want to focus on getting the kill within the first  bullets so get a feeling for how far you need to pull down when spraying. It takes some practice so dont expect instant results from this but it will get better over time. Also start playing deathmatch. Here is a website where you can see all the spray patterns for every weapon and how you need to move your crosshair to counter it. After some practice itll come naturally.gtYou would think that to kill a sniper you would get close to them so you have an advantage. Not in counter strike. All they need to do is zoom in and hit you in the stomach which instantly kills you. Flash bangs do nothing if they know how to look away from them. Smoke is useless because they just spam into it and half the time a lone bullet hits you. In silver if you see an awp the push is over. If you go b and hear an awp you need to drop everything and head a.AWPs are good at locking down one angle preferrably at long range and at quick peeks in and out of cover so you want to avoid precisely that kind of scenario. Theyre bad at dealing with multiple angles multiple opponents  second reload time close range stuff and at retaking sites also theyre really expensive and your team probably cant rebuy one when they constantly lose it. The strongest counter to an AWP is utility in the form of grenades so you use smokesflashbangs to block the angle molotovs to get them out of their cover and then get at least two guys up in his face so no matter if he kills one of you the other one gets the return frag. The key thing here is to not expose yourself when throwing grenades they can and will pick you off until you hear the AWP fire  then you have about a second to act as a team so you need to be fairly quick. For the Upper B one throw a smoke like this press W right before throwing so it lands in the site itself instead of in the tunnel. Then wait for the shot throw a flashbang into it and storm the site  might also throw a molotov onto back plat just to force him to run. The AWP guy might kill one of you but as long as you get the trade kill its all good since youre now v but gained site control. Another option would be the B split I mentioned before  he cant look two ways and the scope really impedes your vision so thats that. ,LearnCSGO,dghqbkd,1,t5_3330f

11790167,0,t3_67aqii,This is the way of thinking that you have to doEach bullet you shoot has a specific value of inaccuracy. The inaccuracy defines a possible area where your bullet can hit. If this area is bigger than your target then your chances of getting a hit is very low.There are  types of inaccuracy also called bullet spread in the game The first level is your range spreadThis depends on which gun you buy. More expensive guns tend to have a better range spread meaning they have a smaller inaccuracy cycle and your chances of getting a hit are better.At close ranges targets take more space on your screen and your range spread cycle also is smaller so your chances of getting a hit are very high. When the spread cycle is smaller than your target or when the cycle has the same size and you can aim perfectly at the middle of the target then you get a  hit because its impossible for the bullet to land at some place that is not the target. The second level of inaccuracy is your recoil spreadWith each bullet fired your inaccuracy will increase for the next bullets. This also depends on which weapon you are buying.So if you consider that targets take less space on your screen at medium and longer distances and your inaccuracy increases with each shot fired the general rule of thumb becomes like this The bigger the distance the less consecutive bullets you want to shoot.However as I said it also depends on your weapon so you cant do a general rule like  bullets or  bullets because each weapon has different stats to this behaviour. The third type of inaccuracy is your movementYour cycle gets bigger when you are moving and the stats for that also depends on your weapon. For example a five seven is a lot more accurate while moving compared to a deagle.Also in CSGO your movement will not stop instantly when you release your movement key. Your player model will continue to run and getting slower until the momentum has faded out and he stops people sometimes call that sliding.There is a technique you can use to stop instantly and thus instantly reset your movement inaccuracy which is called counter strafing or stutter stepping.You get the highest possible inaccuracy when you are spraying your gun while you are moving. Dont do that DYou can test out everything I said above when you play offline with svcheats  and use the console command clweapondebugshowaccuracy . This command will show a white cycle when you shoot your weapon. Thats your inaccuracy. Your bullet can land anywhere in this cycle.I would advice you to test this and what I said above with different guns to see what makes the most sense for a gun.,LearnCSGO,dgwge7g,1,t5_3330f
