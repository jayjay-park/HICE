Then I would say it depends on whether you use an autoclicker or not.  But favorites right now are fairydruid with some activity or goblin for at least  days auto casting goblins greed.  Its more effective if you have improved autocasting or masterful autocasting but whatever,realmgrinder,csrhg9m,1,t5_38frp

11212842,0,t3_5zxogm,This is impossible.One player got Undead L in  days but he spent weeks on buffing S up to k.Lets see. I have S k. Im running FacelessDragon with undeadline. I make e undead FC per hour. In will take me  days to get to to L .e FC. L requires .e so  times longer. Well with time max mana will grow and other bonuses will be bigger but you get the picture ,realmgrinder,df2yo1x,1,t5_38frp
