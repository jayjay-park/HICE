10778221,0,t3_5h95i1,So Ive been scouring the internet all night to get some answers and Ive gotten very few. So at the end of it all I am beginning to think I got a defective product. Not saying its BAD but the one I got stopped working after a few clicks. Stopped discharging so I figured it may be dead. I left it charging for the amount of time it states in the instructions. Nothing doesnt emit the shock anymore and only the mediocre LED flashlight works. When plugged it it shows up as red. But even after several hours so far of charging it. Nothing. Verrrrrrrry annoyed if you had bought it already Id recommend getting a couple just in case. ,self_defense,ddrp1qn,1,t5_32nbx
