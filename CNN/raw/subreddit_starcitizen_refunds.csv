8439592,0,t1_d5wgri2,gt Can you actually tie any specific monetary value to a computer game?In this case extremely easily Chris Roberts has and numerous other people at CIG have done so on several occasions.What we are delivering now just on the Squadron  side is more akin to a huge AAA game that would retail for  by itself. The value for money that people are getting for a  pledge is pretty crazy.Giving  more backers  UEC each would be the equivalent of over  million distributedSure I think the problem is the apparent? assumption that it isnt worth  or that it was priced differently than any other ship we sell. The Starliner went through the same process as every other ship. As with ANY ship or product you sell more if its cheaper  that was my entire point. If Hornets were  wed sell more of them... if Aurorae were  wed sell more of them. But it wouldnt represent the value of the ship as we intend it in the finished universe and it would be more than anything else a cash grab. Itd be making money now instead of thinking through the long term plan.Base packages have a value UEC has a real world value they even sell it directly ships have a value too and the long term funding model for the game is to allow people to buy ships in game for UEC.I could also link you to the trading site to show real world value is placed on these shipspackages.If youre going to argue that the shipspackages arent presales as they have no real value you might want to have a long think about why youve so easily arrived at that conclusion when all the information from CIG says exactly the opposite.Now you could argue the ships are overvalued because you can earn them in game but as of this moment thats not true and could be subject to change.  Even if it was true the stated intention by CIG to continue to allow ship purchases via UEC ingame combined with selling UEC out of game for cash directly gives them value as some people will pay it.,starcitizen_refunds,d5whkq6,4,t5_3fnj9
8442632,0,t1_d5wupgz,Just so you know not angry at you. lol just get wound up on the whole they give refunds if you ask nicely.For the record I did not bail because of delays I bailed on their change of policy. Delays are of course arguably out of their control. That policy change was not quite the opposite actually. It came across as intentionally heinous and melancholic.I then respectfully asked for a refund and they told me to go take a hike. Thats why this happened.I have no doubt they would have happily kept my money if I didnt seek recourse and Id do it again regardless of the monetary amount because Im a man of principles.Im also not sure what you mean by majority refunded. If youre talking about Amazon I forced a refund because Amazon found CIG to be in violation of their ToS because they dont allow crowdfunding sellers use their pay gates unless it uses their crowdfunding platform in particular.All that said I doubt Ill ever support CIG again because of this but I wish you the best of times. Take care.,starcitizen_refunds,d5wv93n,5,t5_3fnj9

9357701,0,t1_d9241qk,This has been discussed here before. When you buy an item from a store during a sale pay VAT and get a receipt for your purchase it certainly doesnt look like crowdfunding. It does look pretty much exactly like selling preorders for digital items and addons for an unreleased game.Also crowdfunding is still covered by the usual consumer protection laws Just because you call your webstore a crowdfunding platform does not exempt you from your liabilities. ,starcitizen_refunds,d925mq1,5,t5_3fnj9

10298445,0,t1_dcbd683,The scam artists increasingly immoral money grabbing behaviour and their steaming shit of a game only continue to prove Lord Smart right. It shall be a glorious day when the entire rotten structure that is Star Citizen comes crumbling down. The fools who mocked Lord Smart will be forced to accept that he was indeed right and will desperately scramble for refunds not realising it is too late,starcitizen_refunds,dcbdumm,11,t5_3fnj9
10298674,0,t1_dcbeixi,What? Honestly wtf? When did our conversation took the turn to insults? Why did you feel the need to insult me?This is what happened so many times during the past  years that I honestly learned to despise the Star Citizen community. So many members can not accept a differing opinion or even someone not liking their game. My posts were well discussed and I had a lot of great talks with people under them that either agreed to me or at least spoke to me in a civil matter.And then they were people like you who take this weirdly personal and start throwing around insults when argumenting gets difficult.You are no better than followers of Derek Smart or he himself. You both interact with people on the same level.Enjoy your time!,starcitizen_refunds,dcbes9l,19,t5_3fnj9

10371679,0,t3_5oj69n,Yes be polite but clear that you dont want anything else than a full refund of your money as soon as they can process it. Dont get upset when they try to sell you the tech demos as progress and stall the refund process. Just repeat your initial request of a full refund as soon as possible. If they flat out refuse mention going to the FTC your local consumer agency and report that they refuse to refund a preorder.They will eventually process it.,starcitizen_refunds,dcjox10,4,t5_3fnj9

10730101,0,t3_5tctxe,I guess on one hand its morally objectionable to exploit backers desire to see progress in exchange for free labor but on the other hand it is a somewhat effective cost saving measure to crowd source play testing. Not to say this isnt worth criticism just that its hard to do so and then immediately complain about wasted funds. Personally I think there are worse things to be concerned with like the lack of progress and general focuses of progress within each update. Namely how theres so much emphasis on appearance and nitpicking refinement of destinedtobedead end systems. But yea under a different light ebiscotti and PTSDU are at least ONE effective cost saving measure.,starcitizen_refunds,ddmqa4r,5,t5_3fnj9

11017739,0,t3_5xbrhc,This is a great opportunity to use the phrase cognitive dissonance in the correct framework. In fact this is an amazing test case.   You are a star citizen. A commando. Youve put in hundreds or thousands of hard earned dollars over a period of  years into a dream project that was led by someone who you have a nostalgic connection with from your childhood. You love the idea of escaping into your own galaxy and being a space farmer or procedural bird watcher. Youre in a community with a bunch of other squad members who all share the same dream and tell you this is possible. Why wouldnt it be? Just take all the best parts of other space games and put them all in one game. Whats so hard about that?One year passes. Two years pass. First deadline missed. Uh. Oh. No big deal everyone tells you. Just a minor regular delay. What was that? They did a poll and decided to expand the game. That explains it. Genuine Roberts is just TOO good a dreamer. He knows YOU want more out of this game.    Another year passes. Where is this game? Its about to be  and all youre seeing is a buggy PU and some fancy demo reels. Other people are losing hope. You see criticism come out for the game. Those people cant be right can they? The nagging doubt in your mind leads you to feel uncomfortable. You didnt waste all that money did you?   Screw the haters. Everyone is buying into the next sale. You should too. Month after month pass. Every patch is underwhelming. Where is everything from the Morrow tour? Wheres planetary landings? They release a clothing shop? Who cares about that?    I can imagine the combination of peer pressure selfshame and disappointment is leading to a whole heck of a lot of anger in these people. Thats why their sub hides the controversial tab. Its why they lash out everywhere they can in comment sections across the internet to compensate for their own selfdoubt.TLDR,starcitizen_refunds,degtw5a,9,t5_3fnj9

11368347,1,t1_dfkhfk3,Then let me enligthen you they do that even for non monetary services like merging or restoring accounts basically just for everything that cant be done automatically to prevent fraud and Bliizard and Ubisoft are just examples. Its also common in retail stores to let them scan your ID for refunds. Not saying that it is good practice either but you act like CIG is an exception.,starcitizen_refunds,dfkkw9u,2,t5_3fnj9
11450503,0,t1_dftpjpk,No I tried to get my money back nearly a year ago now. It was really that the game was pushing deadlines further and further. Dogfighting is fun and all but it didnt appeal to me. I really wanted to be a space trucker. I wanted to mine and explore things. They couldnt even put out the SQ content they were promising. How could I expect them to get to the stuff that I really wanted?EDIT I dont even know what was in the .. patch.

11545803,0,t1_dg3zh4o,I mean the answer is obvious.  They didnt pay anything for the game so why should they be able to refund it?If youre wondering why YOU dont get a refund that is even more obvious.

And congrats it will feel good to get your money back and if something comes out the other end of this pipe worth  then it will get its !Theyve gotten lost in a swamp and i agree I dont believe it set out to be a scam but is in turningturned into one. Promising shit there is no way of delivering and taking peoples money for it is pretty much the dictionary definition. If they had any interest in doing this right they should have capped pledges and sure if someone wanted to give them  let them but they actually get a real stake in the company instead of internet high fives and pixel porn.,starcitizen_refunds,dg63cij,13,t5_3fnj9
