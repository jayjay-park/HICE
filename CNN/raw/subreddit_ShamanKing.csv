Considering the level that all the shamans are starting at ex Yohanes lance being the same power as the spirit of sword it makes sense that Hana is going to use both to become stronger. Also thanks for subbing! Shaman king was my first mangaanime as well,ShamanKing,chtlhuq,1,t5_2y4o8

But I feel like Hana has a lot to grow and the game would spoil things or it would be very inaccurate and this would piss off the fans. I think Yohs story would work wonders with this game and in the future this could happen to Hana easily as soon as we see what is his commonly used Spirit after Amidamaru. ,ShamanKing,chyelfs,1,t5_2y4o8
