7805432,0,t3_4ejpuo,What about the last fight? I just cant handle the dragon on heroic. I managed the other bosses just fine but this one is a doozie. I just cant read the attacks well enough to dodge. And each time it takes a good  minutes just to reach him and die in  seconds. Anyone got any hints?Also you cant drop the difficulty. So Im stuck with heroic. Update Just finished it and the ending was interesting!. Used the sun stone with a charge already built up keep the shield up dodge once or twice but mostly just keep hitting instead of running around trying to avoid getting hit. Much easier this way.,Chronos,d3te4u3,1,t5_2tag0
