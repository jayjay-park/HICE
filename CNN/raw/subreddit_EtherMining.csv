6873617,0,t1_d0vf4jo,I turned to mining with ethminer and a pool because i kept getting in over my head with geth and the consoleyness of it.  Can you mine solo with etherminer and specify a wallet address to send to?Edit I think I got geth figured out..  If I just use it for my mining storage and send it to my mobile wallet when I have some it is easier to wrap my head around than using it as my mainonly wallet.  Ill leave my rig pool mining overnight while geth syncs then switch to solo mining for a few weeks to see how it goes.

7028221,0,t1_d1cw6fi,gt Depends. They might be amazing for next gen graphics APIs but not vastly better at raw processing power for stuff like math. Theyll also be prohibitively expensive for the common man for a year or so and by then who cares?gt gt gt gt Im more worried about  people with a  year old AMD gaming card than  people with the latest AMD Mega Nano Moneybags  STXThis post nails it.By the time these nextgen cards hit the market later this summerfall  they will be pointless to buy because they will be marked up to a premium and the gains they provide will be negligible in terms of absolute ability to accumulate ETH via mining.Im sure they will perform relatively better than cards being used now but at what cost?  My guess is it will be prohibitive and absolutely not worthwhile.The fastest hashing cards are not always the best when you factor in price for the card and power consumption.,EtherMining,d1d0373,2,t5_32rww

11560345,0,t3_64y6q1,Its normal.  The timing for how long it takes to find a block or a share is random.  The expected average over time is the network difficulty but it is not going to be the same for every share due to the random nature of the mining algorithm.  Sometimes you will get more shares than expected in a given span of time and other times you will get fewer  its the average over a long period of time that matters.  And even this average is necessarily going to be a bit below your miners reported hashrate due to the occasional stale share and small network latencies.  If the difference between average and reported hashrate is very large theres probably a problem with the card or a bad overclock but thats not happening here.  Your graph looks perfectly normal.,EtherMining,dg6db9w,3,t5_32rww
