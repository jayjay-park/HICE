9728851,0,t3_5egjz3,Surprised it made it to the Army Times thats interesting. Stars and Stripes ran a poll earlier this year showing Trump leading Clinton but didnt list rd parties it showed Clinton just a little behind Trump. Based on these Im guessing when they included Johnson he stole preference from Clinton. I wonder how many of those who preferred Trump did so because they really really didnt want her to win.I guess its all academic now.,LibertarianHumor,dacal0g,1,t5_2wtvs
