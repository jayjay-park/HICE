I agree about the next limited gacha being Cute and Passion though so I think todays SSR will be Cute because its been longer since we last got a permanent Cute SSR than a permanent Cool SSR and getting a Cool SSR later would balance out the CutePassion limiteds. I checked starlight.kirara as well and November actually followed a similar pattern to this Orange Sapphire happened that month and the limited CuteCool gacha was followed up by a permanent Cool SSR.Of course this is all just my prediction.

Some people find the delay of the note noise after you hit the note to be distracting and turn it off while others use it as a guide to gauge whether or not they hit it.It should be noted you can change the volume of the note hit effects  in the menu where you set the volume of SFX music etc. you can adjust it to your liking.

7304261,0,t1_d27sip9,People give Mio so much crap but honestly Uzuki went on the same sad sap pity train that Honoka did in love live and that aggravated me more than Mios development.How they shaped Mio made her more humanized than Uzuki. And to the UzukiPs keep your pitchforks to yourself. I dont hate her and Mio isnt my best girl. I just dislike how they treated her and in turn how everyone else treats Mio. The mob mentality of hating Mio SOLELY based on the anime when Uzuki got a similar treatment is BS plain and simple.,StarlightStage,d28g1iq,1,t5_39t20

8892941,0,t1_d7gm5to,Per note score is worked out as follows base score derived from your overall team strength and the song difficulty  score boost  combo modifier increases in strength the longer your combo is  combo boost. Same type skills dont stack only the highest percentage one takes effect. If you have a full team of  combo boosts youll lose out on the score boost multiplier. Likewise for the other way around.With each member with the same skill you add to your team their effectiveness goes down due to their skills overlapping. Because of this you want a balance of the two. Since youre limited to  members you generally want  of one type and  of the other. So if youre luckywhale enough to have combo boost SSRs in a team you should drop one of them in favour of score boosts even if theyre only SRs.,StarlightStage,d7gszpw,2,t5_39t20

10507137,0,t1_dcytn65,As said in the other response if the guest you choose has an SSR which boosts dance or one that boosts vocal it will usually make whichever team focuses in that attribute better.    A lot of your passion SRs seem to be alltype. With Miria Id consider putting Eve Reina if you can handle the overload Mary Ayame and Nina. Consider replacing one with your Hinako SSR especially if you dont want Reinas overload skill on there  As you dont have any dance specific passion SRs just now I would go with the all types again to go with Hinako  Mary Ayame Nina and then Miria SSR and any other of your choice.  For a Cute visual team centered around Chieri Id try Setsuna Yuka Saori and Hiromi. Rena if you need a healer.,StarlightStage,dcz3fvx,1,t5_39t20
