5236713,0,t1_cvh7lms,Ha. Thats new. Or the one I found is new. Hes changed his stance a few times so Im not sure because I havent found a way to easily step back through posts besides following links from within more current posts but I know there was one where he said to have a friend post on reddit for you to get your KS out there. It stuck out specifically because the selfcontentlink to blogs reddit thing is my white whale. I will try to find it.,metaboardgames,cvh7pnh,1,t5_3855v

5337817,0,t1_cvtyl6t,Im on board. Id rather find a way to distinguish between a spammy post just a link New stretch goal! with just a link etc and someone coming for actual discussion but thats more subjective. A daily roundup at least makes it so people dont have to go digging for info.To put it more succinctly I want the policy to prevent spam and not discussion.,metaboardgames,cvtyr9x,1,t5_3855v
5383231,0,t3_3or7b6,gtPosts that link to a preview of a campaign before it goes live are off topicWhat does this pertain to exactly? Is it a restriction on campaign previews specifically or game previews that will have campaigns?,metaboardgames,cvzro88,1,t5_3855v
5522953,0,t3_3qq0kg,Is there a reason the self disclosure needs to be in the subject? Would putting it in the text or as a comment not be sufficient? ,metaboardgames,cwhluu8,3,t5_3855v
5558784,1,t1_cwm3gss,I definitely understand the want to increase quality content but if we have to remove rules arent we putting an increase in content over ensuring users become solid community members who follow rules try to abide by the spirit of guidelines etc?Isnt this essentially the same stem of the KS projects? Confusing rules ignoring the fact that there are other relevant subs users ignoring the rules intentionally or otherwise?I really dont like the loss of mandatory disclosure. It leaves users less informed. ,metaboardgames,cwm49fw,2,t5_3855v
5560499,0,t1_cwm8bxy,gt He doesnt have to do this but its a nice bit of disclosure.I dont think anyone will disagree with you here.  I agree that its nice to know when people are posting their own content.  However our method for catching selfcontent before was really only twofold.  Check usernames against websites.  If Jimmbotron posted Jimbotron Runs Through then wed remove their content and request they resubmit with a disclosure..  New users got more scrutiny.  Often new users  low quality posts got removed.  Someone saying check out this amazing kickstarter! when its to Cthulu Monopoly would get scrubbed as it was likely someone affiliated with that kickstarter.There was no other systematic way of determining them.  We just checked every link against every user and Im sure we missed more than a few that were disguised enough to slip through.All this being said there is nothing against either us mods or other users systematically asking people is this your work? when they suspect it is.  Also if a particular project or user becomes a problem we can deal with those cases.  Or if it becomes a problem we can reinstate a disclosure rule.,metaboardgames,cwmbx44,3,t5_3855v
5889647,0,t3_3vgt0x,Its hard to say. Im not sure that it matters but I dont know if these are being posted by normal users trying to share an opportunity or by the contest runners themselves. I see these posts the same as deal posts and I think if you want to address these then deal posts should be a part of that discussion as well as there is really little difference between them. Both are an attempt to alert the general population to something that might interest them and has a financial incentive to the linked entity that people can take advantage of or ignore.I probably lean towards leaving them alone as I like to keep the rules as simple and clean as possible and not have lots of exceptions and caveats. ,metaboardgames,cxro0kh,1,t5_3855v

9027808,0,t3_53vh46,Like others in this thread I think it is a poor idea. The mods do a great job for the most part removing any negative speech.Something to keep in mind with those bots is that not everyone who posts in those subs is doing it to be hateful. Some people post in those subs to refute posts etc. Even if they are hateful if someone doesnt share the same views as you it doesnt take away their ability to discuss boardgames.,metaboardgames,d7x014b,5,t5_3855v
9572393,0,t1_d9sxi0a,Again this is not a case of someone trying to establish a consensus. This is people who jump everywhere from metal music to atheism in order to lecture a specific demographic about what evil bigots they are. They can tolerate us as part of the subculture but not anywhere near leadership or prominent roles.The particular strand we are dealing with now originated with Occupy Wall Street where some people introduced the progressive stack in order to shut up the most active and driven members of the movement. Seeing the collapse of such a powerful and important grassroots movement due to diversity and antibigotry woke me and many others up the danger of this ideology and the necessity of fighting it.Now many people are ignorant of the backstory so to them it seems kinda obvious to root for inclusiveness. They dont know what battles have been fought what agenda they are pushing for or what the stakes are. This is politicized to the core and supporting a movement that wants to remove  not simply add other  elements to the hobby is highly misguided if you actually want true diversity.,metaboardgames,d9szqxp,8,t5_3855v
9575445,0,t1_d9t8ont,gtInstead of a blanket statement to all people telling them DO NOT EXCLUDE WOMENMINORITIESPEOPLE WITH VARYING ABILITY LEVELS the original OP could try Exclusion happens sometimes because there are raging dickholes out there. You may not have experienced it or seen it directly. If someone brings it up or if you do see it happening be an ally and saydo something.I mean...Thats basically what the OP did no? The list of rules is incredibly vague and never once mentions what kind of behaviour is problematic or what groups we should strive to include.Which in itself is actually pretty impressive.I think it says a lot about the backlash that people basically projected all of their own others onto the rules and then claimed they were sick of being told how to think.,metaboardgames,d9tdatg,9,t5_3855v
9576019,0,t1_d9t6wtx,Except here the mods are the ones fueling that changefire locked post was opened by a mod and a friend mod locked it.,metaboardgames,d9tfugx,1,t5_3855v
9580400,0,t1_d9tz28k,No we fundamentally disagree.The post in question was insanely heavyhanded.  It was a solutions first post that told people how to behave when most of them werent even aware of a problem and had a strong perception of the board game community as open minded.  Jumping in with a solutions first approach before even pointing out any problems is going to foster negativity toward the idea of there even being a problem.If you want a gaming community where people feel safe point out exactly how and where people have been made to feel unsafe in the community and ask how we can do better.  Let the community be the big driver of the solution.  Coming in with a solutions first approach implies that the community is already horrible and that they need rules to fix how horrible they are.  Most people do not perceive themselves as horrible and in fact arent horrible.  Most of them havent even witnessed anything they perceive as problematic.  Thus many of those people are going to respond with negativity to someone giving them a bunch of rules to follow in response to something that isnt even on their radar as a problem even if those rules are sensible.  People dont like being told what to do under the shadow that theyre somehow bad people just for existing and thats what a solutions first attitude implies.  Its going to result in negative pushback against even the most sensible suggestions and undo a lot of potential goodwill and progress.,metaboardgames,d9tzamq,8,t5_3855v

10458410,0,t3_5psnyx,This is sadly not something that automoderator can do. However we moderators try to scan and check that people are not only posting their own context but are also interacting with the community outside of their own projects.You can actually see that I warned them as a moderator last time that specific person posted   As such I will be following up with them with additional measures. rBoardgamer is not a selfpromoting ground despite what it can feel like at times.In the future if you see something like this reporting the post either labeling as spam or typing in self promotion helps us immensely. It lets us know that people are tired of that specific person and brings it to our attention. We try to take every report seriously.Thanks for bringing this one to our attention.,metaboardgames,dctkdv2,2,t5_3855v
11342660,0,t1_dfhlpi8,How much empty space there is is dependent on your screen resolution. Im pretty sure thats been an issue with every single past banner image. I think they usually faded to black instead of blue which just seems like a stylistic choice given the image.Regardless you could always find some pictures yourself if you dont want to learn photography. At this point youre basically asking that work be done and that someone else should do it. If you dont want to do it thats fine but learn to live with what youve got. Youre kind of limited with how far your complaints can go if you arent willing to help. ,metaboardgames,dfho5pt,3,t5_3855v
