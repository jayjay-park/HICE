His outlook towards revolution in general and his interpretation of Marxist theory I find to be very deterministic though which is funny because someone like Gramsci who was an ML doesnt echo that same determinism... but you can see in his writings hes fairly economist.Absolutely maybe I sounded a bit more accusatory but all I meant was to clarify that its a complex topic. I think we can see a general evolution towards this in the Marxist orthodoxy with Stalin after Lenin taking the mechanistic and deterministic view of history and revolution to its logical extreme. MarxismLeninismMaoism is something I cant speak authoritatively on but I am fairly certain that MLM criticize at least Stalin for being a mechanistic philosopher.Even though Engels has firmly denied all accusations of determinism I think at least to some extent that this is an element present even in his philosophy and his interpretations of Marx dialectics and materialism.As for Lenins economism this is a broad issue within the Marxist tradition. There has always been a tendency to read Marx in a primarily economical way in the sense that this left the political axis of Marxism as something to be developed or added in this case by Lenin. Of course I could rant about Lenins tenuous grasp on philosophy for hours and I would  I recently reread Lenin as Philosopher but I dont think thats necessary.gt Thats sort of what I mean when I say its idealist. Im sure theres a better term maybe utopian but that doesnt seem quite right. Its not extremely coherent as an ideology and its hard to work out where its flawed unless its put in to practice.I think there are some serious internal inconsistencies and tactical errors embedded in syndicalist praxis but to its credit it does not generally reject alternative methods such as armed insurrection. However I seriously doubt well see a resurgence of the syndicalist movement even though it has its adherents here and there. I think the Endnotes article points out something very important in reference to the revolutionary period in Italy and may  in France where workers often wouldnt form councils or attempt to seize their workplaces. People generally dont want to merely reorganize their workplace and reorganize capitalist production in a more democratic fashion. What is necessary is the abolition of work not its replacement with socialist work.,communization,ddarcmb,2,t5_2y14p
