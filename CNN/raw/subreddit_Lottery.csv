6909495,0,t1_d0z7r4t,I would say dont waste your money. Its likely that you will not make any money. You might have a decent win  eventually  I won a  two days ago  but most likely just small wins. If you really want to put some money up to potentially make more money you should take up sports betting or the stock market. You have more control and its a skill you get better at over time. Scratchers are pure fantasy long shot gambles with no return. Stockssportsbettingskill scratcherslotteryluckfantasy ,Lottery,d0zif4d,3,t5_2qy8d

9201107,0,t1_d7vzyiy,The  is the ticket number from the pack. All scratch tickets have a ticket number and they all have that bar code off to the side. That bar code confirms whether or not the ticket is a winner and if it has been cashed already. In theory all you would have to do is scratch that code and have the clerk scan it to know if youve won. But that takes the fun out of it!As an aside if the store tries to sell you a ticket with that part scratched youre being scammed,Lottery,d8ib3mc,2,t5_2qy8d
