8479612,0,t3_4vthju,Youre a great person and the awesome kind of teammate to have in overwatch with your willingness to switch characters and learn others. I felt I needed to tell you that. Anyways I think there is going to be shit people in all games.. even the Animal Crossing crowd has bad apples P when it comes down to it IMO its about your reaction  or lack there of. If Im in a fiesty mood I annoy them back or respond with sarcasm. Most of the time though I ignore them. Theyre not worth your time theyre not worth my time. I dont think theres a way to rid overwatch of baddies but how we deal with them mentally is something in our control. Coming from an FPS background it can get better as you play against higher levels but thats deffo no guarantee. ,ggoverwatch,d61htc0,3,t5_3e7yp
8574218,0,t1_d6dc6nu,Yeah people are assholes. And I dont think winning placement matches affects it as much as how well you are doing compared to the rest of your team. my girlfriend lost way more matches in palcement than I and got the same rank. So I think there is more to it  Anyway ranked is a real stressful shit show sometimes,ggoverwatch,d6dcyo1,2,t5_3e7yp

9904578,0,t3_5h767j,I honestly just dont talk most of the time unless everyone that is talking is really friendly. As soon as people start complaining about things I know Ill be targeted if I say anything. I feel bad about not communicating sometimes but if people are yelling about things I dont even want to be a part of it. I respect all the women that have the courage to be an active part of voice comms cause I just dont most of the time ,ggoverwatch,dayl8rl,7,t5_3e7yp
