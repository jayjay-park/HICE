If theres no such service near where you live you can use a by mail lens rental site rent it for a weekend theyll charge one day rental for a weekend at most rental houses and decide if its right for your needs. I dont think anyone can tell you if youll like it or not. ,CameraLenses,d6nn9g5,2,t5_2s9se
