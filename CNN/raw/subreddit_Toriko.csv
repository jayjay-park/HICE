1872997,0,t3_2g1yrv,I like the RN into BN theory. I think it would be cool if Komatsus cells awakened however I dont think he necessarily has an Appetite Demon. All we know really is his cells awakened in some form when cooking AIR similar to froze and joa when using their gourmet cells. I think the best bet is that AIR itself will cure him or the more likely would be the use of the Cure Water as before. Although it would be pretty sweet to see him using his Derous Knife to use the God Cooking skills. ,Toriko,ckew11b,5,t5_2sfcq
2252740,0,t1_clpnrd8,Well not exactly the primary audience for shonen series in general is  and you can tell what one falls within each end of the age range like how manga with characters in middle school like Katekyo Hitman Reborn would have a younger audience in the beginning however you have manga like Jojos bizarre adventure and Fullmetal Alchemist that obviously would have the older demographics as the primary target audience because of the graphic content within those series and I believe that is the audience Toriko is more directed towards than any. Heck if I were  or  and read Toriko I would probably get pretty freaked out with some of the stuff in it. I would think that a majority of people would be at least somewhere around  before they could thoroughly enjoy Toriko. ,Toriko,clq5stq,4,t5_2sfcq

5225641,0,t1_cvfksv3,Thatd be crazy but everything in Toriko is... so it wouldnt surprise me. Itd be crazy because so far weve though that Acacia and Neo is the last boss.Considering Acacia seemed to be legitimately a good person i think there is a chance that they might try to separate his appetite demon from him something similar to what happened with Don Slime and Ichiryu that would bring Acacia back to normal and maybe even let him keep some of his powers Ichiryu was crazy strong even without Don Slime.I also belive there is a pretty good chance that the group of chefs and JiJi might find Ichiryu in the other world and he might explain to them more of whats going on and how to fix it he seemed to know a lot more than what he has said.They have to go through the food spirit gate which means they will have the chance to meet Ichiryu there as explained here He might explain to them how he got separated from Don Slime.This whole series is frikking amazing on the level of one piece for sure. ,Toriko,cvfvq39,4,t5_2sfcq

5334009,0,t3_3nx7sp,I just dont think his power scaled well at all. Like many others have said he got wrecked by Heracles and Bambina there should be no way that he could be on par with or stronger than one of the Eight Kings. It wouldnt make sense in the context of the story. Think about it. Bambina gt Blue NitroBambina give or take GuinessBlue Nitro gt Acacia before he turned into a giant...monster...thing. Im only drawing this conclusion from when Acacia states in a flashback that no one can fight the Blue Nitro.Assuming that Toriko is fighting on par with Guiness now...Toriko  Guiness and BambinaToriko gt Acacia premonster and Blue Nitro.Theres a good chance theres some flaws with this theory Im pretty tired.I just think its ridiculous that he could get this powerful of nowhere without any reasoning besides he had great potential and magically out of nowhere with no explanation he was able to tap into it.  ,Toriko,cvth8u3,4,t5_2sfcq
5567296,0,t1_cwlqxir,Thing about DBZ is that the author wasnt trying to show us how strong or fast his characters are as much as Toriko did. Saiyans increased their powers and speeds exponentially.So if Goku was able to fight at a speed that is invisible to naked human eyesat the tournament when he was a child we can assume that hes million times faster by now. Its just that DBZ fighting would be boring if its shown in real time.,Toriko,cwn69ur,2,t5_2sfcq
5568376,0,t3_3r7rn2,Well lets consider thisThe most powerful character in the DBZ Universe is said to be Whis currently as he outclasses Beerus who can apparently fight both Super Saiyan Blues. Super Saiyan Blue is beyond that of Super Saiyan God. Super Saiyan Gods fist strikes when colliding with that of Beerus were enough to shake the very foundations of the universe. It is also said that Beerus could destroy the universe by himself. So we have universe busters even if we havent seen them. Beerus tapped his nail and dropped a small amount of energy which destroyed half a planet. So we know hes VERY powerful.According to Akira Toriyama SUper Saiyan God Goku is a  Beerus a  and Whis a . So if Beerus can destroy universes imagine what Whis can do? On top of that Vados is supposed to be stronger. Whis has the ability to rewind time itself.Now lets consider the Torikoverse. In terms of raw power the most any character has really claimed to be able to do is destroy a planet. Now NEO has been said to be able to devour the sun but still that isnt the same as instantly destroying it. Monkey King Bambina can hurl mountains around the Toriko world with apparently no effort and this wasnt even in his full form. He isnt even the strongest of the Eight. Moon is powerful enough to devour all light though somehow not water. I assume he can reject what he doesnt want and caused a creature to break the laws of physics and escape into the back world just to escape. Moon is also powerful enough to swallow one of the NEOlings which Jiroua planet buster had to knock into space in order to get rid of. totally think this will come back to haunt them by the way.However in terms of power none has actually destroyed a planet. Don SLime was closest with breaking the moon.So id say in terms of raw power currently DBZ wins. They probably arent even at Frieza levels yet. However in terms of agility I would say the Torikoverse wins. Bambina destroyed three of the four heavenly kings in literally the blink of an eye. HE can perform  movements in approximately  second. These characters can exceed the speed of light and throw objects that strong. So id say this.Power DBZSpeed TorikoDo I think the Torikoverse will match the DBZ verse in terms of raw power? Perhaps if we have a space arc. At best id say we are going to get multiple planet busters level characters possibly equal to around Frieza maybe Cell. ,Toriko,cwnb3hl,1,t5_2sfcq
