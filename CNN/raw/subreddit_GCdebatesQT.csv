I find TERF to be an accurate descriptor of your movement.Except not every gender critical feminist considers themselves a radical feminist and I dont think holding transgenderism to the same standards as anything else under a feminist analysis is necessarily exclusive. Also the word is barely used in the context of the acronym its levied at any woman who says anything contrary to or questions the trans narrative. gtI wont use it because you dont like it. See? Thats compromise.Right and its a compromise to agree not to personally misgender posters and to use neutral language where possible. gtThe former is a logical conclusion of the latter.Again you cant just cripple the opposing side in a debate by saying they cant express one of their core ideas. It would be like a Christian debating an atheist setting down a rule that the atheist isnt allowed to say god doesnt exist because that upsets them. You can say youre excluding transgender people but throwing TERF! around is just useless. EDIT and actually your insistence on its use would be a bit like the hypothetical Christian debater from before insisting he be allowed to call the atheist darksided while also insisting the atheist cant say their god doesnt exist.gtI would like to not be insulted and hurt though.

6298925,0,t3_41vb2s,I think require is probably too strong of a word. And Im not too sure about belief either. I know what you mean but Ive never considered it in those terms. To me belief implies some conscious thought or choice. Beliefs are flexible. I used to believe in Hell. Now I dont. Now I believe that reincarnation probably makes the most logical sense out of all the dumb ideas Ive heard about afterlives. But my belief could and likely will change again as I go through life. My gender identity isnt a belief to me. Its just a part of my internal sense of self. I dont know how it got there. Your theories are as good as mine. But its there. Its been there as long as I can remember. And Ive never seen any evidence that anyone can make it go away. I could suppress it just like I did for most of my life but it doesnt then cease to exist.Now as to misgendering thats easy enough to explain. It hurts because it is an indication of failure.An objective for many trans people is to be seen as a member of the sex they present as. Some do this to feel better about themselves internally some do it for safety some do it to make others in society feel more comfortable but whatever the reasoning the trans community pushes this as the most important goal. I think its pretty harmful and toxic but its also a selfperpetuating cycle and in many places a necessary evil for ones survival as a functioning member of society jobs housing friends etc. There are three reasons someone would call me heSomeone who intentionally refuses to use my pronouns. lt I dont care about these people. These are the equivalent to people telling you that youre going to Hell. Pretty sure the vast majority of us roll our eyes and move on with our lives. Wasting time worrying about these peoples opinion of you is a recipe for disaster.A stranger who reads me as a male. lt I dont get mad at them. I get mad at myself. Ive spent a lot of money and effort that I didnt necessarily need for my personal comfort in hopes of being able to blend into society and not attract attention to myself when Im out going about my day. This person has just informed me that all of that was wasted or that Im not trying as hard as I could be. And also that I need to be especially alert for potentially hostile andor aggressive strangers. This has the potential of knocking me off balance a bit and upsetting an otherwise good day. A friend who slips up lt This probably hurts the most depending on the circumstances. Sometimes people just slip up and its genuinely an accident. Shrug and get on with your life. Other times it means they dont see the new you and it can be distressing when you have invested a lot of money and emotional energy into this whole trans thing to learn that your friends arent necessarily on board with you. The phrase misgendering is violence is pretty hyperbolic but thats one of those things that come with the Internet. The Internet makes people crazy.  ,GCdebatesQT,cz5m7pv,7,t5_3bm34

But if it did become a problem you could set up a system through the dmv or something where you were approved to use a different bathroom.  I think gender neutral bathrooms being added where its possible is also a good goal because it gives people more options.  But if there are a jump in sexual assaults in bathrooms.  My thinking is probably more towards the problem population ie rapists.  Do we need more police?  More sexual assault prevention programs?  Better rehab programs?  Stuff like that.

Thankfully the Black community put their foot down on that issue extremely hard during and after the Rachel Dolezal incident and did NOT accept the concept calling it out for what it was offensive blackface that coopts and demeans blackness. Liberal feminism has gone totally off the rails not only on gender but also in its embrace of the sex industry as somehow an empowering free choice for women. Basically what hes seeing is that trans ideology is the latest in a series of attacks against actualradical feminism as described here  and that its logical outcome will be the total destruction of feminism and the resinstatement of natal males as the dominant sex caste no matter what feels they have and what clothes they wear.

I love it were told the risk already exists so get over it.  so a lot of these questions are tongue in cheek and meant to showcase how the only response I see to these concerns is to completely dismiss them as irrational and give it the label bigoted. You wanted an explanation to help understandBut honestly if there are no social consequences no barriers from social rules  why do trans people care in the first place??  and your answer to that will probably be with more depth and Id like you to carry that depth over to trying to answer why natal women might also care about the risk to themselves. ,GCdebatesQT,d01yq2o,15,t5_3bm34

I am certainly not accusing you of the same sort of dishonesty but I should point out that in both cases the special rights are just the same rights as everybody else made accessible to a different group.So while the process of changing the sex on documents is something that I believe only trans people would do it is the right to have accurate or I suppose we could at least agree on acceptable documentation and all that that brings that is being upheld. Much like the way that the law had to change in order for homosexuals to get married it was a change to our preexisting law for the sake of upholding peoples preexisting rights. In both cases its making changes to the process and the paperwork for the good of the actual human beings.

7544533,0,t3_4ik7gi,Gender is not a social construct it is the result of our biological foundation. Gender is an alignment of our behaviours to our biological sex and has been crucial to our survival and development in evolution through natural selection.Experiencing gender dysphoria is a defect an abnormality of this phenomenon. The hormonal influence that determines our gender affects us around  or  months into development in the womb. Someone who experiences incongruence of gender to sex of such a high degree that it is clinically distressing will fall into the category of disorder currently outlined in the DSM or ICD.Body dysmorphic disorder is not the result of biological malfunction in the same sense that gender dysphoria is rather it is the result of social and cultural pressures impacting the selfesteem and general mental health of an individual. There is a biological influence here however it is limited to not much more than genetic predisposition. Malfunctioning of serotonin in the brain personality traits and life experiences are the more prominent determinants of the condition.The key difference between GD and BDD is the extent of delusion.A person diagnosed with GD does not necessarily believe that in reality they are a woman when they are objectively male rather it is an ingrained perception of misalignment between mental position and bodily reality.A person diagnosed with BDD obssesses more extensively over appearance. Not only is the obsession usually more extreme than GD appearance issues the individual will develop issues from things that are incredibly insignificant or nonexistent. This furthers itself away from GD in a different angle on the concept of clinical delusion. BDD sufferers potentially truly believe that these imperfections are reality when they are objectively not. GD sufferers know how they feel but accept that in reality when they look in the mirror what they see is reality. They are under no delusion that they are biologically male if they believe they should be female and vice versa. GD can coexist with schizophrenia in which instances it often is a full delusion but Im just sticking to GD alone here. Thats my take on it. Im a lot more educated and broadly read on gender identitytransgenderetc than I am with BDD hopefully I didnt say anything in here which is absolutely false.,GCdebatesQT,d2zryth,1,t5_3bm34

7592991,0,t1_d359thk,This is a bit confusing because we were talking about one thing how we feel about our bodies and you seemed to have shifted to talking about masculinity and femininity. Ive criticized these coded behaviors as much as GC feminists do and my inspiration comes largely from a community of trans feminists that reject this narrative. I think its a symptom of a problem rather than the cause as GC feminists seem to feel and I have plenty of experience backing this up.Julia Serano who has a bad rap in this community because shes trans and a feminist and actively works as deconstructingdestroying common GC arguments went into a lot of detail about how in order to understand the trans movement separate this idea of gender roles from normal human expression gender and even sex. But sure criticize the entire trans community not on what the leaders say but upon the questioningconfused and most often starting to consider transition. Without understanding the theme of the Intrinsic Inclinations Model any observation of trans people might be lost in confusing terms and associations as we have done here today. Perhaps it would be easier to suggest that trans women new to the community can easily fall into the same trap as you have here and that to really criticize the theories of trans people you might have to actually look at the theories that people actively undergoing or have undergone transition might propose.,GCdebatesQT,d35a9lh,1,t5_3bm34

Like these words from the same article in  gt Ive spent much of the last decade writing about trans woman exclusion and trans woman irrelevancy in queer womens communities. and these words from the same articlegt gt  I certainly do not expect every cis queer woman to swoon over me. And if it were only a small percentage of cis dykes who were not interested in trans women at all I would write it off as simply a matter of personal preference. But this not a minor problemit is systemic it is a predominant sentiment in queer womens communities.and these words from the same articlegt  In other words queer womens spaces fulfill our need for sexual validation. Unless of course you are a trans woman. And personally with each passing year it becomes harder and harder for me to continue to take part in a community in which I am not seen as a legitimate object of desire.This is also a person who wrote an entire book about how feminist and queer women communities should be more inclusive to trans women the book is called Excluded Making Feminist and Queer Movements More Inclusive and who does things like write about the FAAB mentality and why its a problem in blog posts.This is also a person who coined the word transmisogyny in order to make queer womens communities open up to her.I borked the link early so now Ive fixed it.,GCdebatesQT,d35ieuj,10,t5_3bm34

What the hell is gender identity? Well it depends on the person defining it. Its not stereotypes except when it is. And then we all have one except nontrans people say they dont. But thats because theyre bigots.I dont hate you. I dont hate trans people. Before I became aware of their beliefs not from gender critical mind you from askt and other trans forums I came to the conclusion that the public was accepting of a culture they largely know nothing about.So many trans people paint themselves as victims and as the most oppressed group ever. Yet women get killed every day. Biological women get killed every fucking day. But that doesnt make the news because thats boring. Because thats typical. Because fuck women. The moment a trans woman dies it has to make all the rounds of every liberal leaning publication though. Never mind that its never the white middle class trans people who say they could get murdered. Never mind its the trans people of color who are murdered doing things that those middle class white people would never be doing. Nevermind the facts when theres literal violence being committed. I dont like redefining myself to make way for a natal male. Not when natal men control and define everything within our society. I refuse to be defined by a male. I am not a collection of feminine thoughts and feelings. I am a human being with a vagina. Natal males can wear dresses paint their faces do whatever they want that doesnt make them female. That doesnt make them my sisters. That doesnt give them a place at the womens rights table as a biological woman. Women arent advocating for the rights to wear heels and lolita outfits theyre fighting for the right to be taken seriously. For the right to not be seen as a fucking object all the damn time.Do you know how many times Ive gone to the trans forums and have seen them describe a woman as a stereotype? How many times Ive seen them proclaim to be better than natal women? Or redefine words that most of society doesnt use? Or say how porn helped them find their inner woman? Or discuss their jealousy over natal women? As if its our faults. As if some humans arent supposed to be born biological females. Where else would you have me vent? Where else would you have me go where Im not instantly labeled a terf for not welcoming every person with a disliking of masculine gender roles as female into my life? I dont hate you. I hate the policing of thoughts. I hate the smugness I read of natal males saying theyre more female than me because they actually had to evaluate themselves. Its ridiculous.

The difference is  in  bank tellers dont get robbed at gunpoint. But I just didnt see that perspective. I had some vague idea that every rape mapped to another rapist and theres so few rapists so it cant be all that bad. Obviously there are bad things men do more commonly than rape but the more common those things are the closer to benign they are so it still didnt seem fair to paint men in the light I saw them painted. This is an ignorance. I think it just drives people away to assign a villainous hashtag to their wellmeaning ignorance. Is every notallmener like me? No. But I appreciate the reaching out that women like BicyclingElephant and Dahlia extended to me when I was in my ignorance.

Because I thought that it was the most common argument.gt They were mislabeled by a doctor who made an incorrect assumption about their sex based on their genitals.Incorrect assumption of gender not sex. The fact that some particularly desperate people go ahead and insist that gender and sex are equivalent has no bearing on the fact that there would be no problem with their assignment if it had matched.gtAs I understand it the trans in trans identities refers transitioning from that mislabel.I may be wrong here but I am pretty sure that transition tends to be transitioning from one set of sexed characteristics to another otherwise people would only transition legally rather than physically. If it were really a matter of trading one label for another dont you think that trans people would be focusing on that rather than issues surrounding physical and social transition?gtThe theory positions dsyphoria as merely symptomatic of relentless misguided sex assignments at birth.Yeah thats my trouble here. Sex isnt assigned but gender is. The fact that the two get conflated by everyone on Earth is pretty annoying for discussions like these.In what way does it make sense that dysphoria over physical characteristics would be entirely dependent on what those characteristics are called rather than how they look and function? To make another hypothetical do you think that if everyones sex were wiped from their birth certificate tomorrow and everyone were simply asked if they were male or female that trans people would simply stop being dysphoric? Even if I had never been called male I would still have the same loathsome set of sexed characteristics. As the GC crowd likes to point out taking the name away doesnt solve the issue.gtIf assigning sex were to cease it stands to reason the dsyphoria trans people experience as we know it would also cease.Again even if my body werent called male it would still not be the body that I want.gtIn this hypothetical scenario that is precisely what happens. I never said Sarah is sexless. She is a female.Yes where female is an arbitrary term with no meaning. I assume that this sort of Checkmate transes was your intention but the case that you are arguing is pretty far from anything that either side of this debate actually wants with the exception of course of the fringe elements.gtIf by less important you mean Sarah and her doctor somehow refer to her being biologically male for medical purposes unfortunately as far Trans Inclusive theories of sex and gender go that is not possible and would be considered exclusionary.Other than really desperate parts of trans activism I dont think that most trans people would argue that someone who has not transitioned in any way and still has a completely and unambiguously male body should have the medical implications of a typical male body ignored.Even then by your own hypothetical standards the doctor wouldnt be noting Sarah as male but as a female with a penis and so on.

Some people have been shut down because they were trying to cure trans people by enforcing gender roles others have been dismissed for trying to project the reasons that they shouldnt transition onto others but it isnt as though they are just shutting down all discussion everywhere.The reason you dont see hard evidence is that people have looked and come back empty for years and denying people treatment because you want to test out your pet theory is idiotic.,GCdebatesQT,dch1kev,3,t5_3bm34

If the US wants to go multiuser unisex for bathrooms theyre going to have to deal with the stall issue. At least extend the door to the floor and get rid of what can be over an inch gap between the door and the frame.Occasionally Ive brought up the topic though in idle chat and gotten some response indicating that in the US people want to make sure no one can barricade themselves in a stall or go in there for sex.

I literally was in my twenties when I realized a particular curve in my hips I always viewed as wrong and fat and hideous was caused by the shape of hip bones themselves for fucks sake. Nothing is too minor to hate. I have hated everything from the size of my big toenails the particular size ratios of my knee to ankle diameter and my torso to leg length the hairline along my neck and far too many other things to mention possibly even remember. And this was on top of all the more obvious body hatred and the experience of a girl growing up who was  tall skinny blonde blue eyed light skinned and fairly conventionally attractive. I only mention to try to convey just how deep and universal the indoctrinated selfhatred goes. There is no satisfying the ideal.  Having sex with men I did not want to have sex with. Sex that brought no physical pleasure sex that was even painful. On top of ripping out or shaving off all the hair on my body to do so and dealing with continual pain and irritation as a normal part of life. Trying so hard to change my disgusting body into what it was supposed to be as if I couldnt have had gotten laid  the sex I didnt want to be having and didnt enjoy in the first place  otherwise! what a joke only to feel more disgusting. Not enjoying sex  what is wrong with me. Sex being painful  what is wrong with me. Having body hair  what is wrong with me. Skin on my genitals bleeding and breaking out in rashes when I try to remove the hair  what is wrong with me. My skin has redness in it visible capillaries in it stretch marks from when I hit puberty my hair is the color and texture that it is I have flesh in shapes that are normal to have as a female human being  what is wrong with me how do I fix this keep looking for a solution keep trying to change myself into something that I cannot exist as  it was all fiction in the first place. Obsession selfhatred and misery. Yet all this is all just the background baseline state of being as you go about your life. Once you actually consciously recognize it for what it is is when you start to let go and move forward. tldr a continual peripheral knowledge of yourself as disgusting and wrong and in need of fixing while simultaneously sacrificing yourself and your own pleasure for others.

And I think for most women transgressing gender norms is something we are often punished for so its not so fun. The Gender Troubles  The Butches documentary might be of interest to you.Makeup and other decorative fashions certainly has in different periods and across different cultures been masculine or gender neutral. In western cultures today I think it is clear that makeup is absolutely tied to womens beauty norms. I would like to see that connection be cut but no I dont think makeup will ever not exist or be used.Its not that i see masculinity as inherently superior. Its that I see masculinity and femininity explicitly connected to gender as they are as a set of norms that serve sex oppression. So what we call masculinity which really can only be definined in relation to femininityand vice versa is central to the way women are oppressed. I dont think I personally am read as masculine because of my dress sense or presentation Im too obviously female and pretty. Im just read as not sufficiently feminine lazy querulous.

Anything promoting or not outright condemining antifeminists such as Milo Yiannopolous or Jordan Peterson should have been downvoted into oblivion if actual radfems were the majority of that sub. I was accused of virtue signalling recently when I pointed out that Milo hates women.I dont think the sub is as welcoming to WoC as a radfem space should be.  Too many people who sound like liberals or conservatives and not radicals. ,GCdebatesQT,dga89lt,13,t5_3bm34
11600019,0,t1_dgarj00,One exampleThe thread was deleted but Leelah was the topic. Here you find some gems likegt Gays Dont give up it gets better.Trans Well inevitably kill ourselves if people dont do exactly what we say. gt They turn it into a self hostage situation where everyone around them is ostensibly at their mercy. These families are guilted into feeding their delusion or else. If you call me he again Im going to kill myself! Call me SHE. Parent who feels backed into a corner Im so sorry darling I love you sooooo much. Ill call you whatever you like! Then the parents become trans advocates but not necessarily out of their own free will. Theyre afraid.  gt Take responsibility for your mental health. Dont pin your wellness on the behavior of others. You cant control what they do. You can only control how you behave. gt dying for the cause cult.         ,GCdebatesQT,dgavd1j,2,t5_3bm34
11603062,0,t1_dgb6ykc,You may disagree with trans people here as may I! but youve just invalidated your claim that trans people only respond with hamfisted parodies.,GCdebatesQT,dgb7sxx,5,t5_3bm34
11650869,0,t3_6693tp,It is generally considered bad discourse to make fun of someone by ridiculing their viewpoint where they arent directly responding to it rather than debating them in the thread they specifically made for people to debate them in.This is not to be taken as me objectlevel agreeing with the person you are not debating which I dont.,GCdebatesQT,dggn20f,7,t5_3bm34
11653896,0,t3_6695x1,I would say no.I have heard of people who took the discomfort that they feel at how they are treated due to their sex or gender nonconformity and started to see it as a problem with their bodies.I admit that I dont fully understand it but it seems separate from the sort of dysphoria that trans people experience and would probably not be helped by transition.If you are talking specifically about the people who just seem to naturally have entirely sexbased dysphoria with no easily identifiable outside cause but claim that they are not trans then I have no clue. They seem to fit the definition perfectly but due to some reason or another claim to be cis.At that point I guess that it depends on how you define transgender. If it is identity based  then no if it is dysphoria based then yes etc.,GCdebatesQT,dggzf53,5,t5_3bm34
11669365,0,t1_dginosa,In my eyes selfidentity is a necessary condition for a gender identity to be applicable so in my view a former trans woman who no longer identifies as trans is a nontrans man a detransitioner. Cis refer to the gender of your natal sex so by claiming to be cis the former trans woman would claim to identify with the male gender in my eyes.I saw you above supporting the definition of gender identity as What I would rather be in an ideal world and I have no problem with you defining your own gender identity that way. But even with that definition cis gender would still not be applicable to all nontrans people as we dont know what they would want to be in an ideal world so it cant be assumed they all would rather be their natal sex in an ideal world. I am a nontrans woman in an ideal world I would not care what chromosomes I had and my ideal body would be androgynous and incorporate physical elements of both sexes. ,GCdebatesQT,dgiql58,2,t5_3bm34
11671638,0,t3_66ieoy,Well when I was passing I rather enjoyed the whole not feeling as terrible about myself thing. I liked my body a lot more when I looked more like a woman than I do now.Obviously I cant speak on much biology wise due to being trans but I would guess that I would probably be happier with other aspect of my body if they were female as well.It was also kind of nice to have a much cooler selection of things to wear even if I never actually did so.I also made friends a lot easier though I dont know whether that was a matter of being seen as a woman or not it seems like an odd coincidence.The really interesting thing though was the difference in the way that people interacted with me. A lot of men rather predictably stopped treating me as an actual person for lack of a better term but at the same time my interactions with women were just better. I dont know how to describe it really but there were a lot of little situations where they would do something small like find some excuse to drag me away from an uncomfortable situation or sympathizing when I was having a crappy day.I dont know how to describe it really but it was pretty nice.,GCdebatesQT,dgizvcr,5,t5_3bm34
11682891,0,t1_dgk9jqe,If you look at mainstream culture Hollywood mainstream porn romance romcoms drama soaps. Males written and played to be erotic targets are always gender conforming and dominant.

11702736,0,t1_dgmi87q,Actually now that I think about it my definition seems flawed because there should probably be an ought statement in there. I could totally see people wanting particular characteristics without actually feeling any sense of loss or whatever from not having them.Apologies for wasting your time with that definition. You would rather be male but dont feel that you ought to be Im guessing thus you wouldnt say that there is any sort of identifying as a man going on.At the same time it wouldnt work to just make an ought statement because that seems insufficient without acknowledging that it would be based on how you see yourself in an odeal world i.e. there is no reason that I should feel that I ought ro be female except that it is how I see myself in an ideal world and I suffer as a result of thay mismatch.Given that it seems like the definition should be more dysphoria based maybe something along the lines of The set of sexed characteristics that you feel would minimize your dysphoria ?In any case I see that my definition itself needs some work so I will get back to you with that.As for the last paragraph Even by my first definition I have a hard time seeing how hair and skin color would have a significant enough effect on your life that you would need to specify it without taking something like racism into account which I tend not to do for these hypotheticals.,GCdebatesQT,dgmivcz,2,t5_3bm34
11710025,0,t1_dgn3vv9,Does it sound wrong?I can see why it sounds bad. But if it wasnt distressing if I wasnt dysphoric about it if it wasnt pain then it wouldnt be a thing. If it was just like enjoying a fashion then it wouldnt be a problem. Its about being completely at odds with society.I dont think things can be as easy as society changes and its all resolved. Im resigned to my expression being forever at odds with how things are.,GCdebatesQT,dgnd08w,2,t5_3bm34
11726388,0,t3_67b3tr,Platonic intimacy both physical and emotional. The amount of distance men keep between each other to keep from looking gay is so terrible. I wish I knew men who werent like that and even if I did I know Id have to get over my own socialized discomfort to even access what I want.And assertive independence. One of the things that makes me the most angry about female socialization is how it robs many women of the ability to say no fuck off! Thats an affront to agency. And it allows so many other things to keep going. Imagine what the world would be like if every time any woman was bothered by a catcall she was like fuck off asshole.,GCdebatesQT,dgp7t00,10,t5_3bm34

11765047,0,t1_dgtkyi5,When I say social gender Im referring to all the aspects of gender that are social rather than physical such as roles expression expectations traditions.Its easier just to say social gender. I dont see that as forcing politics through language its just using more precise language when you are trying to be more precise on a complicated topic.What word do you use to describe people not being comfortable with gender norms?Im not asking you to agree with anyone. Im just asking you to say what you think of people who say they have body dysphoria regarding their gender.What word do you use to describe people not being comfortable with their body?,GCdebatesQT,dgtljdm,4,t5_3bm34
11771445,0,t1_dgtvl40,To me it seems like an extremely similar thing. And I can easily envision a world with no gender. Step one spread radfem ideology. Step two raise boys and girls the same. It would take several generations but to me it is entirely doable. To you it isnt because you believe in innate gender. ,GCdebatesQT,dgubpel,7,t5_3bm34
