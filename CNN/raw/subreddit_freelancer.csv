10841581,0,t1_db62t8o,There is more to FLs combat than meets the eye I think especially if you consider how weird the system is with weapon groups and the extend to which weapons can be moddedmade. FL is one of those classic shooters kind of like quake where pvp requires actual skill and skilled pilots simply cannot be dominated by lessskilled ones in v scenarios. After so many years of playing PvP in it thats what I truly miss  this living world in combination with online multiplayer and PvP even with some roleplaying involved. The problem with FL is that its way too obsolete for todays standards to be called a contemporary shooter and the engine itself is just too old.But damn what I wouldnt give to see a true remake of FL... Perhaps with a combat system which is much better while still keeping that accessibility but not without including the crazy learning curve of the original FL pvp. I would also participate in such a project with pleasure as a volunteer but Im afraid I cant contribute with coding. Perhaps only with sound and story work. In any case this is a very long shot and Im kind of expecting it to never happen. CR is already involved deeply with Star citizen and we also have Elite Dangerous. But none of these games match the atmosphere simplicity and humble yet rich world of Freelancer. Games have become so boring to me and I genuinely miss the times when I was just getting into online FL with mods as a young teenager. It was an immersive experience and trying to get good at pvp was quite the adventure across many servers.lt FL,freelancer,ddy8dou,1,t5_2s4xs
