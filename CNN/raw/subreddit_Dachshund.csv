Positive reinforcement along with the clicker will take some time but it will help. Hes probably been through some difficult stuff in his little doggy life so spanking will only bring up more issues. Continue to work on making him feel comfortable and safe. Youll get there. My little guy was a bit the same when I first brought him home. He was scared of everything and quite nervous.

Heres how I got her into the routineFirst make sure youre using an enzymatic toothpaste. I use Petrodex poultry flavored For the first few days just introduce the toothpaste as a nice treat and let them lick it off your finger. If you can try to begin rubbing the toothpaste on their teeth the big canine tooth is probably the best introduction to this just to get them more comfortable with your finger in their mouth.Your dog may be different but I found that mine are much more comfortable with a finger brush versus a normal toothbrush. Obviously this is going to be the toughest part of training getting them comfortable with your finger brushing their teeth. What I did was cut up a baby carrot into several small pieces and any time your dog lets you have your finger in there for even a split second reward them with a carrot slice. I really really recommend making the positive feedback as constant as possible.Slowly but surely your dog will become more comfortable with the routine. To try and make things easier for the both of you create a routine of areas of the mouth to brush. For example I do  areas on each side of the mouth  bottom canine top canine bottom row top row and the ones in the very back. Not only does this make things more predictable for your dog it takes the guesswork out of how thorough a job youre doing.At some point I transitioned my dog from brush one area get a carrot slice to let me brush all your teeth you get the whole carrot.The number one thing to remember is not to ever force it. This is already going to be weird enough for your dog you cannot be getting frustrated and trying to hold their mouth open to get a few more seconds. If they want you out of their mouth get out. Has has has to be fun and rewarding for them.Hope that helps let me know if you have any other questions.,Dachshund,cqrxecr,2,t5_2qpj2

We live in the back country and every once in awhile one of them will come across a snake and pick a fight with it. Thus the dead snake ends up in the yard being rolled around on and growled at.

5213708,0,t3_3mdp2f,My grandmother had this massive German shepherd. Tyson was massive easily the biggest shepherd Ive ever seen and he had this huge leonine head and ruff of hair. He was also the biggest softie in the world though sadly he had all kinds of problems bung legs bad skin and this terrible smell and I think being uncomfortable made him more withdrawn. He saw a vet every month we did everything we could but he was a result of bad breeding practices Anyway we were out walking him and hes subdued as usual taking his time. This rottweiler comes up out of nowhere and its off its leash. Its menacing our female Australian cattle dog who could normally take care of herself but was panicking because the rottie was trying to mount her. I pull the rottie off by its collar and it goes to snap at me. Tyson lets out this bellow wasnt a bark it sounded like a big gong and a big drum being hit at the same time. Seems to triple in size as he places himself between us and the rottie which promptly fucked off.Gran also had this rooster who would chase us. We thought it was a game until one day the rooster took a chunk out of my brothers leg. Tyson had lived peacefully with this rooster in the same backyard for  years but this was the last straw and he took the roosters head off. I miss that dog. ,Dachshund,cveg143,6,t5_2qpj2

10679725,0,t3_5ss7dv,Sending good thoughts! Sounds like you did everything you could at the time so that is a plus. My CiCi had an issue similar to this and we did crate rest. She hated it but got significantly better and is back to normal. Hope there is some breakthrough for you soon but I would recommend looking for a specialist or second opinion before you let him move around more.,Dachshund,ddhj6pt,1,t5_2qpj2
