8468856,0,t1_d6033ee,London School of Economics. Its like the humanities version of Imperial. Very prestigious university targeted by investment banks. Piss poor in satisfaction tho. Not you need to worry about tho.,UniUK,d6059tt,1,t5_3cw2d

8613477,0,t3_4xtjla,Well she could be wrong with her expectations so shed have to wait and see. If her grades are very close to ABB then the admissions at Coventry could well let her in anyway. It depends on how many people have fulfilled the offer for the course as well as the overall dietetics scene in the country are there other courses being offered elsewhere and what their offer requirements are.If she has legitimate reason why her grades were a little poorer than they could have been then it would be wise to let the admissions know. Depression should be included as a reason but the admissions team may well ask for proof of medical condition perhaps I have no idea but it is a possibility as people could be lying to excuse their grades without official proof.Unfortunately if depression is the cause for her grades to drop going to university at slightly lower grades may prove difficult for her mentally  she may suffer from the extra pressure that a degree comes with as well as possibly underperforming compared to her peers.,UniUK,d6ia5kq,4,t5_3cw2d
8642584,0,t1_d6luoc5,Thanks for responding again and I definitely agree with your first part  I do get quite easily anxious and stressed about things like that. I still think a reapplication to my firm in the hope circumstances change might be looked down upon as Ive messed up their numbers so late and what not and that would stick out more. But perhaps Im being pessimistic. And I suppose maybe a gap year is something to think about although there are further complications I havent listed unfortunately. Thank you again for the good advice.,UniUK,d6lxln8,1,t5_3cw2d
8646385,0,t1_d6mem5i,Looks like the first  are your overall grades and the extra Maths and Further in the th and th row are your AS results in those subjects.  Congrats!,UniUK,d6mer1n,1,t5_3cw2d

8763693,0,t3_502kym,I know of very few relationships which started before university lasted more than one year with one or both of the people at university my parents being the only exception I can think of. So in all probability it will suffer enormously. Sorry.,UniUK,d714fw7,2,t5_3cw2d
8779462,0,t1_d72tpqw,Ill tack on to this and say that I did a year out and resat some exams and I got offers from Leeds Manchester Sheffield Nottingham and Birmingham. Like Oxbridge will be a no but normal Russell Group ones will be no issue ,UniUK,d733pgv,1,t5_3cw2d
8871482,0,t1_d7e7d62,Yeah Im sure there are other banks with good apps I just wanted to state how awful and cumbersome the HSBC UI is for example I had to put in two passwords to log into online banking apparantly I need additional security to add a beneficiary so I had to add a secure key which required another different password on the app on my phone then I had get a transaction code to add a beneficiary on my phone which meant putting in the same digital key password on my phone again and then the flipping online website logs you out if your inactive for about  mins... which is NOT a lot when youre first setting things up!Compared to Barclayscould do it all on the app logged in using Touch ID added a beneficiary asked for my CSV code as confirmation THAT WAS IT.God bless Barclays,UniUK,d7e86ol,1,t5_3cw2d

9021632,0,t1_d7w98zl,Theres less green space now.  The course seemed rigorous to me with excellent students. The Maths department was even better but tbf its world class. Theres a joint Physics amp Maths degree too. What do you attend to do after graduation? ,UniUK,d7w9bvw,1,t5_3cw2d

9219368,0,t3_56mpj2,By submitting early you get it out of the way so you can focus on coursework etc and its a load off your mind and youre likely to get a faster response but in terms of your likelihood of getting offered a place it doesnt make a difference. If you can submit early though by all means Id definitely do that the stress of getting it done at the last minute is definitely better avoided if possible. ,UniUK,d8kmf0u,1,t5_3cw2d

10507539,0,t1_dcz3ffn,Theres a few that provide around k and one that provides around k. There is a surprising amount if you search around. Theres also the uni bursaries themselves which are around .k sometimes k per year.

11494150,0,t1_dfy6gph,sure. I got unconditional from a university. so after I take it in results day lets say I have got grades that are better than the grade requiremen that my university that gave me unconditional wanted. So that means I can go through clearing or adjustment for slightly better universities. So can I ask them to release me on the results day so i can go through adjustment for a slightly better university. I hope I made sense,UniUK,dfyv087,1,t5_3cw2d
11636406,0,t1_dgeynm9,Oh dont worry Im gonna do that for almost all my exams except one of them which is a new module so there is no past papers....... Thats gonna be fun haha The reason behind the  days on  day off was to fit time in for my dissertation. Basically I do  hours of one module and then  hours of another in one day. Figured  hours of revision would get my brain into gear in regard to having  hour long exams ,UniUK,dgezznz,1,t5_3cw2d
11791504,0,t3_682b84,Dont worry about the ensuite. If you can get it and afford it then its not bad but no bother without. Ive never had an ensuite. My ex did though and it was nice to be able to go to the toilet in the night and not have to put clothes on. I didnt miss it when I went back to my flat though.,UniUK,dgwlupb,2,t5_3cw2d
