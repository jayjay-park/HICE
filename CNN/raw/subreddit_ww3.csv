Though if anything happens to Kim his military is so dedicated they will launch a retaliation on their own even launching ICBMs and SLBMs. They do not need launch codes like the US does the SS mobile launch system The BIG mobile ICBMs we saw in that parade is field programmable fire and forget meaning the missile crew programs in coordinated and launches the rocket used the old MilSat and Magellan GPS system way back when but I assume they have upgraded them to work off the current GPS system seeing how GPS modules are a dime a dozen these day straight from China... This is a multistage rocket and can reach anyplace in continental USA. They were typically outfitted with a single    Megaton thermonuclear warhead or     Kiloton MIRVs and decoys depending on the order request. The real question we need to be asking is did NK get the SS with warheads and are they reverse engineering one to try and replicate their own bombs?NK military command does not operate like the US or other countries and we are slowing learning that. We have to expect ANYTHING from them.Sending SEALs in would be a suicide mission anyways Kim is heavily guarded and protected and I doubt Trump would send our SEALs on a one way trip.If a hot war does break out we can expect to see the civilian populations of cities and town pick up arms also to defend their country that is how dedicated they are to their leader.,ww3,dggd3rs,1,t5_2tdc3
