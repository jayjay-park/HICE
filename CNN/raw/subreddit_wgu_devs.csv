I took multiple PAs and was ready to pass them my first day of the term so I just had to wait until my camera showed up and then I was able to knock out three classes in one night.  ,wgu_devs,cx40g2z,1,t5_39m4n

7042503,0,t3_4c24q0,Congrats!! Im still a long ways off. Taking Web Development. Do you recommend studying for these Java certs as soon as i take the first java class? Like studying throughout the program as i take other classes? Btw how much programming experience did you have before this program? Do you feel like this program has prepared you well for programming jobs?,wgu_devs,d1emi9m,4,t5_39m4n
