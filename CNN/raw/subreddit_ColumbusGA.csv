2585430,0,t3_2pcjt5,That Bibb Mill is a shame.  My parents worked there from when I was growing up until it shut down.  When it burned down there was a nice little thrift mall in the lower levels Joeys is the same one just moved after the fire and they were working to restore it for other uses.  ,ColumbusGA,cmw1xq4,2,t5_2rn8i
2792641,0,t3_2s1osu,Im a huge fan of Chesters BBQ. There is one on Veterans just before you get to the Civic Center. Its not really a sit down and eat type place so plan to get your food to go. Its not the driedout smokey BBQ like Countrys its tender with mustardbased BBQ sauce. Also their Brunswick stew is second to none. Mike and Eds isnt bad. Ive heard good things about Chicken Comer too which is on Veterans behind Mellow Mushroom.Like usuperdankmaster said stay away from Countrys. It sucks.,ColumbusGA,cnlih10,4,t5_2rn8i

7266015,0,t1_d23wckz,I gotta agree with uMinisquirrelturds. It would be a complete waste to live in a place like Columbus after graduating from a great school like UGA.
