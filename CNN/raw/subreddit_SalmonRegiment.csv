415014,0,t3_1yu0kp,Thanks man. You make a number of good points. Mainly when you feel like fapping go find something to do.I considered fapping earlier today. I thought about just giving in and doing it. I thought about changing my mind about this NoFap thing. I thought about how great it feels to fap and how I dont feel that bad after.Ive done that before. Ive gone down that road and relapsed. And every time I did I felt bad that I did. Not better. And I really did feel that bad afterward. So Im not letting myself fool myself again into thinking that fapping leads to me feeling better about it. Not this time not again. The reward is a lie.,SalmonRegiment,cfns5px,2,t5_30fn3

993945,0,t3_25hd16,Hmm  good things. Well lets start out with the bad thing I edged today. I saw the sports illustrated magazine and almost relapsed but I stopped myself. I realized that edging is only ruining my progress in nofap. Edging seems to be my real enemy this streakmy second longest streak  days! In the future I will probably start doing some pushups or take a cold shower when I get the urge.  Now for the good things. I realized just how much better I feel on nofap. My mind feels clear and I am definitely more confident. When I edged I felt this wave of cloudinessnot sure how to explain it in my head. . I noticed that some of the hot girls are starting to look at me morenot sure if this is even remotely related to nofap. . I also got a B on one of my finals which I consider good since I crammed for it. . Fargonew TV show based on the movie is on tonight so thats a plus.  . I had some good donuts.  ,SalmonRegiment,chh9onp,4,t5_30fn3
1642896,0,t1_cjlts13,Thanks for the kind words I really appreciate it! I have not given up the fight and I will never make that mistake again. It was a stupid mistake that I thought would turn out differently but it has shown me not to trust in the ways that our minds try to trick us into easy pleasure.Again really I do appreciate the fact that you said I could be most supportive commander! This being my first NoFap War I really am happy that my efforts helped my brothers and sisters of NoFap and of both Orangered and Periwinkle armies.Like you said the person I have become was briefly on vacation he is now back and is here to stay never to leave again. And as for Rise Against I am open to hear more quotes from their music! Also I will continue my efforts here in our Barracks and in the greater NoFapWar subreddit. This War has helped me become even stronger by giving me another solid foundation to root myself in. I hope to fight alongside you again in the next War as well Nexuslab!UPSTREAM!,SalmonRegiment,cjm927n,2,t5_30fn3
