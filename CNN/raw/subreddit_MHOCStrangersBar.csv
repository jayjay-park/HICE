4827001,0,t3_3gz9g0,At least in regards to a model world electoral roll I can give some insights. During the rRMTK elections we had to use the help utimanfya to identify MHoC users who werent allowed to vote if they couldnt speak Dutch. In total we had ish votes of which around  came from MHoC users. A list that would contain the names of people that have voted in rMHoC in the past would have helped us to identify these users faster and would have saved us some time. You could ofcourse counter this by arguing beginning model parliaments need a surge in foreign members as a kick start which is true in the case of English speaking model parliaments. Initially this surge of activity is useful but after a while these parliaments dont benefit from having hordes of people that dont know anything about their country specific politics and only vote based on ideology vote or participate in it.Im convinced that a model legislature should be a representation of the opinions of the people that they seek to represent. So if  of the Canadians voting in rcmhoc are for instance communists then so be it but if that isnt the case then a communist party shouldnt have  of the seats in said model legislature in my opinion.,MHOCStrangersBar,cu2zeok,5,t5_34e1d

5191491,0,t1_cvbrber,Can you logically explain how posting a genuine unaltered video of the reallife leader of the Communist Party of Great Britain MarxistLeninist is in any remote way slander?It was a very relevant video to post considering the party which Harpal Brar is the leader of in real life has just been formed in MHOC. I intended for it to spark some debate and constructive discussion about this new formation.For example you could have come in and explained that you dont share Harpal Brars views on North Korea meaning you do not hold the same position as the reallife equivalent of the CPGBML. Or you could have defended what he said because you agree with him. I dont know.In any case what I was hoping for was a discussion about it. I hoped for a civil one too. It was actually a very good opportunity for you as the leader of this party to introduce yourself properly and get accustomed to the rMHOC community. Youve personally introduced yourself in the introductions thread but this was your chance to ideologically introduce yourself and your opinions on international affairs.But no. All you did was come in and swear at me with a personal attack and actually fail to understand the difference between the reallife leader of a party and yourself as the leader of a model version of that party. Then when I tried to reason with you you continued down the childish path of personal squabbling and bickering. And to top it all off youve accused me by the act of posting this video to actually be attempting to slander your new party.If you want to be taken seriously in rMHOC youre going the wrong way about it.,MHOCStrangersBar,cvbrmkj,2,t5_34e1d

5945123,0,t1_cxywnnn,Yeah but if you start taking modern analysis such as that of Varoufakis you can easily get exploitation  and even exploitation of surplus value  without the labour theory of value. RE the original article though moving from manufacturing to service isnt necessarily a bad thing. I mean if productivity skyrockets between  and today by over  hint it has then it simply means that our needs have changed from material to semimaterial or we have demanded more services than goods. In which case so what? Obsession with material things is silly and in fact the cause of early Marxian alienation services are much harder to alienate because we commit the entirety of the service and so are expressing our speciesbeing by objectifying our action. Obsessing about goods over services is unjustified and needs more working out before taking for granted that a market sector shift from goods to services is a bad in itself.,MHOCStrangersBar,cxyxp1y,1,t5_34e1d

The President can remove him and individual Commissioners by request of the Council or Commission can be compelled to retire on account of a breach of obligations. Just like members of the Cabinet can only be removed by the Prime Minister. The only time the public has a say is every  years at a GE. gt It is as if to get rid of one dodgy MP we had to have a General Election againYou mean what we have to do?
