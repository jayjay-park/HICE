2834279,0,t3_2sjiun,How are you connecting the account to Outlook? As an IMAP account?I would recommend instead you get Google Apps Sync for Outlook   .This sets it up and syncs flawlessly.  Labels from the web are setup as folders in Outlook.  It is one set of data meaning whatever you do to it in outlook on the web mobile or tablet  its the same everywhere.  No data duplication and you can live in Outlook all day long.Hope this helps.,GMail,cnq94na,2,t5_2ql26

5119913,0,t3_3l3xcy,I dont think so. But you could attach the URL or subject of one email chain to the other one as a reference. You could just reply only to yourself with this info. Or there are add ons that let you attach notes to an email. I use ActiveInbox which is a full program where you can add notes tasks follow up dates statuses etc to an email and basically use Gmail as your task manager. Thats overkill for what you need but Ill use it to do just that by adding a note of the other email chains URL.,GMail,cv35405,1,t5_2ql26
6728737,0,t3_47reu3,In Gmail terms archived simply means it isnt in your inbox. As your sent mail is not in your inbox as it hasnt been received and therefore it makes no sense to be in your inbox it is by design archived for want of a better term.All sent mail is visible in either the all mail or sent views. If it isnt you have an issue.,GMail,d0fb6e6,1,t5_2ql26
