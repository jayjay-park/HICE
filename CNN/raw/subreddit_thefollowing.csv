249076,0,t3_1wy2eh,I seriously think Ryan needs to lay off the dating scene. FOREVER. The universe is is trying to tell him he needs to lead the single life! Emma needs to die like yesterday! I dont think there has been a tv character I have despised as much as her. Im hoping over the next couple of episodes she dies a horrible death and is never spoken of again and Mandy becomes Joes number one girl! Boy is Emma gonna be pissed when she finds out about her. ,thefollowing,cf6kk0u,4,t5_2u2hv

362204,0,t3_1y73au,Good episode.  I was glad to see Giselle get what was coming to her.  The scene with Emma and the twin was pretty interesting especially when we learned he has a phobia about being touched.  I thought it was great when Joe turned down Lilys proposition to him but then he changes his mind at the end!  Darn it Joe. That is pretty disturbing that Lily would keep an innocent girl down there just for something like that.  I hope we get a confrontation between Emma and Lily.  Emma is right they are all crazy.   ,thefollowing,cfib3x5,2,t5_2u2hv

422884,0,t3_1yuwp0,I actually think they could end the show this season and have it end conclusively.  To be honest I cant see there being enough plot left to go more than three seasons.  ,thefollowing,cfoli3a,4,t5_2u2hv
425036,0,t3_1yukw7,I always thought that the original purpose of Joes stupid writing and obsession with Hardy was with the goal of turning Hardy into a killer. If so Joe seems to have succeeded and then some.I kind of expect Joe to get himself built back up feeling good about his success and restarting with Emma only to find out that Claire is actually still alive and Hardy isnt as messed up as Joe thinksplanned.,thefollowing,cfotj3b,2,t5_2u2hv

2445272,0,t3_2nia6r,Yeah I can definitely see that coming.  They have great chemistry together on camera and theyre going to have to find a way to keep Joe Carroll relevant and involved so that kind of collaboration wouldnt surprise me.,thefollowing,cmdxul2,4,t5_2u2hv
3350145,0,t3_2ydorr,Maybe but at this point they probably have most of the season sketched out.  He may be more heavily involved if theres a season four.,thefollowing,cpa53n7,1,t5_2u2hv

4028669,0,t3_36hobm,My wife and I quit watching after the first season and didnt even care to watch that finale.  It was like watching the legs being plucked off a spider watching what the killer did to Ryan.  By the end of the first season wed both grown to hate the show with a passion though weve always loved Kevin Bacon.The fact that they continued this sadistic torture for  seasons boggles my mind and make me wonder why it took so long to cancel it.  Not a damn thing enjoyable about the whole show.,thefollowing,crfhybv,-1,t5_2u2hv
4049125,0,t3_36mk4j,I thought it was fantastic up until the very ending of the last episode. You could almost tell the exact moment where they would have started the rewrite.,thefollowing,crhty0v,2,t5_2u2hv
