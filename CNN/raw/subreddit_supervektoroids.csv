11113937,0,t1_derfgq3,gt Xbox controller works and mapping the thrust and pew pew functions to the triggers work but pressing the triggers does nothing in gameplay.Working on this Seems we didnt change controls for a while and forgot this was a thing!gt Things I thought could be tweakedgtTurning right and left is mapped to the left sticks left and right and is unlike some other control schemes like in Blazerush or Luckeys tale where the thumb stick controls which direction you wish the player entity to face. Mapping left and right turning to separate buttons might be preferred so that players immediately understand it is that kind of control scheme.gt The default controller mapping puts thrust and firing on two buttons you control using a single thumb. I wanted to be able to thrust and do the pew pew at the same time so I use the bottom of my thumb to control thrust and the tip of my thumb to control firing. We made this like the classic Super Mario Run and Jump kind of thing but being able to change the mapping to triggers etc should be done soon  at least before EA releasegtThis could probably be a smoother process by having the default mapping of the two functions on buttons controlled by other fingers.gt Considering all of that I propose two control modes or defaults that players have to choose upon first run of the application in addition to still letting them customize what each function maps to later on in the menugt Classic controls. Like in the original Atari Asteroids cabinet map left and right turning to separate buttons. I suggest dpad left and right. Thrust and firing can stay as they are.Im not sure how doable this is uPixelStrikeSina can probably talk about how easydifficult this would be in Rewired that said that may tie in nicely to a mobile version. We will discuss this idea for suregt Casual controls. This one is more of a departure to make things feel more simplified and easier to pick up for the casual audience. What I suggest is keeping left and right turning on the left stick but also map thrust to the left sticks up direction. So that leaves firing which I suggest should be left on the current button to keep things consistent with classic mode.This was our first control scheme actually and both Sina and I liked it but most people we tested on found this unintuitive. That said I am game for extra control schemes now that you bring these alternate ideas upgt EDIT if those casual controls dont actually work that well I propose another idea to a simplified control scheme that can be called casualgt Left stick controls which direction you want your ship to face in. Make it like Blazerush and let the player see an arrow pointing to where the ship wants to face the direction is  so pushing up on the stick directs the arrow up in the players viewperspective. But so that no balancing needs to be changed what youre doing under the hood is simply getting the direction of the thumstick and then virtually pushing left and right buttons based on the angular difference between where the ship is currently facing and where the thumstick is dictating that it should face. After the ship turns to reach that angle the left or right button that was virtually being pushed is let go of. In this scheme thrust would stay on the same button but I suggest firing to go on the right trigger.Again Im not sure how doabledifficult this is uPixelStrikeSina can probably talk about how easydifficult this would be in Rewired. However this then destroys the ships being different as far as turn rate goes.The ships are divided in feel by the followingDrag friction on the ship basically how fast it comes to a stop VFO has maximum drag Looney Lander has none Weapon Rate and Weapon Size Ship Size Turn Rate Acceleration Max SpeedSHIP BALANCING SO FAR VFO Ultra fast small high turning rate fast guns. Full drag. Basicially the most unbalanced ship in the game LooneyLander Ultra fast small high turning rate fast guns. Zero Drag. More balance due to how floaty it is great for backwards shooting Geowarrior Wide beam weapon slow turning and fire rate. Decent balance between slow but wide gun Stroider Semi fast thinner weapon high fire rate decent fast turn rate. Decently balanced I guess its a big ship too more susceptible to hits perhaps Duelly Slighty wider bullets though they need to be changed to fit the ship. Decent fast turning good weapon rate but its the widest ship so again harder to get through tight spots. We considered making this ship almost have  lives as a bonus if you clip one of the ships you still have a second chance with the remaining ship but its speed would decrease and now only a single weapon Vextrex I think this ship needs a slightly bigger weapon and is a good starter ship.  BTW We are considering locking ships until you hit a certain achievement such as Kill  enemies Get  points Defeat Glytch Recurring boss Destroy  Asteroids Make it to Wave X feel free to add ideas on this!  We want to do Steam Achievements tooTurn rate is important to us so Im not sure how this could be done. Worth discussing with everyone though.,supervektoroids,derr7dl,1,t5_3iab2
