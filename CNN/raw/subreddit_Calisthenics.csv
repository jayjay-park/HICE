2222462,0,t1_cljf38g,Hi there uhumorouslettuce.  I didnt want to make a whole thread just to ask a question and you seem pretty knowledgeable so I figured Id just ask you directly  Im just starting a calisthenics workout regimen after being a lifelong couch potato.  Calisthenics feels like something I can just do whenever I get a notion  like I can just knock out some pushups real quick and then maybe after dinner just do a couple of squats etc.Do I lose anything by breaking up my workout like that?  I end up doing the same amount of reps as if I did them altogether  sets of  pushups squats amp dips I just do them throughout the day as I get the chance.,Calisthenics,clmbtqz,1,t5_2t32r

You want something that can slide on the ground but not so much that you face plant.,Calisthenics,cqrkpox,3,t5_2t32r

7793946,0,t1_d3s0f4t,Yea i think this might be the case. Usually when I work out intensively I get sore for a day or two and in those days I stretch hydrate eat massage the muscles and try to recuperate as fast as possible. I did these things during this week as well its just that the soreness didnt stop until day  which was kind of extreme for me. So now when I got back into the swing of things I was expecting myself to be able to do some pullups but ended up failing and only doing .. I did a beginners exercise today to see if I get sore and possibly better in a few days. Its just that this kind of thing has never happened to me before or heard of it happening before therefore I was kind of worried I fucked myself over.,Calisthenics,d3s3j5c,1,t5_2t32r

8356827,0,t3_4u1p0s,They do recommend you move on to handstand pushups after mastering paralell bar dips you can do these on a couple of chairs if needed. As for bodyweight rows I would say that if you cant find a place to do themunder a table or maybe a fence outside then you could work on scapula pullups instead of rows till you get strong enough to use tuck front lever rows. In scapular pullups you pull yourself as high as you can without using your arms. While this exercise doesnt hit all the same muscles as rows it has some of the same benefits and could probably work to some extent as a substitute.example,Calisthenics,d5m5m2h,1,t5_2t32r
8670119,0,t3_4yo12a,I have the App. I liked the simplicity of earlier versions. Id recommend the current App for guidance on routines variety and form. The exercises are completed as a circuit but most of the routines are musclespecific chest back arms etc. ,Calisthenics,d6pdvwd,1,t5_2t32r
