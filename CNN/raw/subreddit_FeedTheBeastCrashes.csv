950500,0,t3_24ynhm,I am going to guess this is a problem with your graphics driver. I dont know that for a fact but its trying to render something and then right after that it crashes hard in a way java is not supposed to crash.

1852992,0,t1_ckc5qde,You can contact uRichardG bot author if you notice a common crashand fix that can be added to the bots database. He is usually pretty quick about that.With this particular error its the same one that happens when you put incorrectly coded client mods some minimaps extra HUD elements ... in the server mods folder but ChickenBones probably messed up some code accidentaly that makes the mod run clientside code thus giving the same error so i i guess its not as trivial to add a special case for this special case.About how the bot works i presume it searches for certain keywordssentences and responds if it matches one which has ofcourse room for error as you see in this case,FeedTheBeastCrashes,ckchbny,1,t5_2w3xc
