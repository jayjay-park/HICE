1668978,0,t3_2dgsa5,These are really great.I have been collecting with my mother since I was just a wee lass about . We werent real serious collectors but we had a huge collection of silver dollars and silver half dollars and old silver quarters and silver dimes and nice nickels that we had amassed over the years mostly just looking through our change before spending it. I was really proud of our little collection now that I am becoming more serious about collecting.We kept our coins in a piggy bank that I had since birth.I picked it up yesterday and uh... It was light. Like very light. I opened it up and only a few foreign coins and newishold pennies were left oldest one was a  of Georgie Porgie. My step brother robbed me and my mother blind. Im sure he didnt know the value of anything and just used them as cash to buy smokes and weed.Seeing your coins brought very bitter tears to my eyes.I know this is very random but it happened yesterday and Im still upset. Moral of the story dont trust thieves and dont keep your very special sentimental coins in a piggy bank.Your post does give me a bit of hope though. I hope that one day soon me and mom can head to a bank and start new. So thanks.,CRHcanada,cjpjbhb,2,t5_30jnk
