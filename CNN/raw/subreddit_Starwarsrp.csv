6108241,0,t1_cyjx4tn,As the bandit leader stormed up to the speeder Wyler flinched at the insults being hurled his way. At least any questions about if these bandits might be good people were being answered now.Youre really making me wish it was your blood all over this speeder you sick son of a bitch! If he didnt need his hands to drive Wyler would have covered his mouth in surprise. Did that really just come out of my mouth?When the screaming man tried to spin out the speeder but failed Wyler forced a laugh as loud as he could muster hoping it would be heard. Taunts were about all he had to keep himself from curling up in the fetal position. He was reminded of advice his mother used to give him Dont ever let them see you sweat. She probably didnt mean for it to be applied in this way.Xeriss message brought a muchneeded relief to the Nautolan. Okay good! He replied. Im starting to get pretty sick of these guys. Just in case Im going to try and run them in to some other stuff. Dont worry it wont be your cover.He kicked the speeder into high gear again turning right for the camp. Coming your way! Lets make this one count I dont know how many more close calls I have in me!,Starwarsrp,cyjy0jq,1,t5_2tg2b
6186207,0,t1_cysszo6,Kandar returned the droids gesture before following NPO into the dining room. There sat two men. One he assumed was the Senator though had no indication of the identity of the other.Greetings Kandar bowed politely to neither of the two in particular my name is Kandar Ventos. A pleasure to meet the pair of you.Now the question was why hed been summoned here. Did they seek his aid? Perhaps the situation was more grave than hed initially anticipated especially if they were calling upon him. Then again perhaps they just wanted the chance to dine with a celebrity. It wasnt often one would stumble across the last Jedi in existence.Might I have a seat? Kandar asked. ,Starwarsrp,cyst2j3,1,t5_2tg2b
6205078,0,t1_cyrmzn9,Xeris mad run across the open ground goes surprisingly well and hes unseen in efforts.Making it to the first building he was correct that it was locked but using the vibrosword he was able to open it. Inside he found a bunch of old broken equipment and a bunch of holoscreens that were locked with a password.Moving unseen to the second building he found what he was looking for. The equipment shed.Full of things restricted to the indentured miners the lock took more effort but he got through it anyway.Xeris found four packs of explosives a remote detonator which can be used for all of them and four DCs locked in a weapons rack which he was easily able to open with the vibrosword.He has no problem communicating what he found with the others. He also passes on that from his altered position he can see that the First Order ship is an Atmosphere Assault Lander a ship equipped only with an antipersonnel blaster.,Starwarsrp,cyuy9d5,1,t5_2tg2b

6223292,0,t1_cywjn31,Whilst awaiting for Khylens response Kandar turned his attention to the second Senator.My plan is to build a team Kandar replied hopefully with Jedi though if not Ill have to make do with the standard types youre bound to find. If we are to oppose the First Order than a team of specialists may prove to be quite useful against them.As a secondary objective I want to either hunt down any surviving Jedi or attempt to train a new generation. Should the worse come to pass to myself then at least the Order will have the chance to rise from the ashes once again.Kandar sipped from his water before continuing.What news do you have from the New Republic? How have they reacted to the mass carnage caused by Starkiller Base?,Starwarsrp,cyx0rf2,1,t5_2tg2b

8550126,0,t1_d6abci6,What the hell!  Why are they shooting?!  How badly could the runt have screwed up? Zavin says quickly initiating the docking sequence with the station.  He knew he was pulling into a fight but he wasnt happy about it.  This was supposed to be an easy job.  The Office lands and Zavin springs up from his seat and starts to head for the door.  Before he does he grabs an intercom linked to a speaker outside of the ship.  Lets see how this goes he says to Darwin before activating it.  We wish no harm were coming out peacefully we wanna talk this over with whoevers shooting at us.  I repeat dont shoot us we come in peace.  He throws the intercom to the side shutting off the speaker after he finished.  He grabs his rifle from the wall.  Okay if they shoot us shoot the hell outta them right back sound good?

8570724,0,t1_d6cqofv,Seeing Trev walk up to the door the Nautolan turned to him.  He appeared increasingly nervous as a confrontation with the captain had gone from being a dream of faraway victory to being a real imminent confrontation.  The underling was feeling the tension and from the look of it so were the men under his command manning their barricades with their eyes fixated on the door none of them speaking a word.  The look of men fearing for their lives.You going to fight with us mister Ward? asked the Nautolan hopeful.,Starwarsrp,d6cx7kb,1,t5_2tg2b

At first it was silent to himself but he slowly grew louder making the guards uneasy. Soon the giggles had turned to maniacle cackling. One of the guards had enough and put his gun to Trevs head and yelled to stop the laughing. In response Trev summed the craziest eyes he could muster bit the hollow end of the rifle and stared the guard in the eye still cackling away.,Starwarsrp,d728sji,1,t5_2tg2b
8867224,0,t1_d7dp8bi,Allan slept soundly his dreams peaceful and his breath steady. He hadnt slept this good in weeks. In fact he barely dreamed at all. If he had been asked later on he probably could have only answered that he had been piloting in his dreams. Flying across the expanses of space. And yet it was what he dreamt every night that he slept soundly. Dreams of his sitting at the helm of a ship. A few hours later still awhile before the sun arose he woke up. He laid in bed quietly as to not disturb Volene. ,Starwarsrp,d7dpsa0,1,t5_2tg2b
9039026,0,t3_53ucq4,The freighter that flew in that day was in good repair and bore the symbols of a popular shipping company in the coreobviously stolen. Furthermore the ragtag crew that got off bore none of the aforementioned symbols. Drem walked over to the terminal acting like he was a spaceport official which surprisingly worked. He quickly sliced into the flimsy defenses offered by the aging terminal searching through long lines of code and data looking for the ships comm channel. He found it and radioed the cockpit. The female voice responded with a gruff Yeah?This is inspector Wrenius Yaktukkis. I trust youre prepared for inspection?Inspection? I never heard anything about an inspection. The female was confused but it seemed she believed he actually was a spaceport official.This is Hutt Territory Darling. The Hutts cant let just anything land on their landing pads. This was a bit trickier as the hutts could and did let anything land on Nar Shaddaa but his risk payed off.Okay fine. What do you need to do?Youre going to have to let down your boarding ramp and follow me to the engines. Well start there. Drem clicked off his comm and crept silently to the edge of where the boarding ramp would come down. The female bounty hunter never knew what hit her. Drem stunned her from behind and hid her behind the freighters landing skids. He ran up the ramp skidded to a stop and hit the button to close the ramp. He moved towards the cockpit easily bypassing the locked door by fiddling with the electronics. He swung himself into the pilots chair and looked at the controls with disbelief. Hed driven speeders before but never a ship. Regardless he pushed a button that seemed like it might turn the ship on. Nothing happened. He spun the seat around looking for the computer interface. Finding it he deftly hacked the system. A few lines of code later the autopilot kicked in fired up the engines and shot off towards orbit. Avoiding a few nearcollisions Drem managed to convince the autopilot that the core worlds would be a good place to go and the freighter pointed itself at the the distant planet of Duro the shipping companys base of operations. Then the controls exploded.,Starwarsrp,d7ycihq,2,t5_2tg2b

9153732,0,t1_d8avu64,In time we will be able to. Right now even with the admiral controlling several of the Galatic Navy finest vessels we still need more than that to conquer the Jedi and the Republic. Drow crouched down to the dirt picking up a small twig and began to draw nondescript lines in the dirt while he spoke. The Republic in itself is fortress the Jedi their army. Mere naval and ground assault cant bring them down. We remember the history of the Clone Wars however ancient. The Jedi were a key element in the war even though the whole galaxywide war was orchestrated by the Sith. They have learned from their mistakes since then never to fall as they did then. Numerous are the Jedi and the Republic is even stronger than it once was. That is not to say they cant be beaten. The Jedi have numbers but their power in the Force is what is weak. Think of the Force as a river flowing along until it meets a fork in its flow. One split of that stream trickles to the Light to the Jedi. The other the Dark side and the Sith. Now think of all the Jedi that draw from the Force from their tributary of Light. The flow will weaken as it reaches each and everyone of them. The stream that flows to the Dark side isnt the same as that of the Jedi the less of our number the stronger our pull of the Force shall be. This is how the Sith controlled the galaxy in the days of the Empire and by purging the galaxy of the Jedi the flow of the Force becomes stronger to the Dark side. When the Jedi returned the Force had a new place to flow into one. You know of whom I speak Luke Skywalker son of Anakin Skywalker. With one Jedi the Sith were able to be defeated and stay routed for this many millenia. The Dark side stayed dormant for most of these years past because no one was strong enough to use it. Until now.We have learned from our mistakes Tarnus. As have the Republic and Jedi. They wont be defeated like before. The Republic is a body the Jedi like an immune system. And the Sith are the cancer to break it down. We must attack and cut off its supply of blood of air of anything which keeps it going. That is how you kill them both with one fell swoop. We must weaken their trade incite political upheaval and keep the Jedi at bay by any means necessary. I have ideas for now which I will reveal in time to all of the alliance. For now lets start small and learn patience. In time I believe we can prove Admiral Lightkiller wrong and see the downfall of the Republic and Jedi in our lifetime.With all of that being said Drow stood up and tossed away the twig. He looked at Tarnus and spoke. See about this Senator and alert me when you leave and Ill watch over the academy here. Ill be leaving soon to meet with my newest business contact to secure resources that we may use here.Drow turned away to begin the walk back to his cruiser then stopped and spoke one last time to Tarnus And while youre on Coruscant pick up some spices for your next meal. Or possibly kidnap a chef altogether. Drow chuckled to himself and walked away to his cruiser eager to see what came his way. ,Starwarsrp,d8cavbk,1,t5_2tg2b

10336490,0,t1_dcfnwox,Credo paused a moment it seemed that the other man had misinterpreted what he meant. He shook his head tapping his blaster with his thumb again insistently. No no... Were right where we need to be. I just need you to be ready. In a minute or two the script hed uploaded to the casinos central computer would cut the lights once the lights went down Credo was planning on eliminating the thugs inside the building. They were involved in something awful and with the information on his datapad he had the means to prove it too... but there wasnt a court in Nar Shadaa that would convict the men responsible. As such Credo had decided to take matters into his own hands and see to it that the casino was put out of business... permanently. He made eye contact with his bodyguard and directed the mans eyes with his own towards the piggish Gammorean across the table who was busy picking its nose. Credo made his way back to the bar slapping down a hundred credit chip. He offered a tightlipped smile to the fourarmed alien. Fine you win. Just get me a bottle of whatever thisll buy Im not picky. The Besalisk laughed riotously turning around to grab a cheap crappy looking bottle off the shelf...  And the lights went out.  Credo exhaled to slow his racing heart unholstered his blaster and thrust it forwards into the aliens back. He pulled the trigger three times blowing a trio of holes in the Besalisk before vaulting over the bar. It was loud and certainly not at all stealthy but shock and awe were the way to go in this situation. He silently hoped that the other man would be able to handle the Gammorean across from him as he pulled the two blasters off of the dead bartenders body.,Starwarsrp,dcfp6k7,2,t5_2tg2b
