367991,0,t1_cfiuyhz,oVirt Quick Start Guide is the first place to start to get up and running.  This will define the terminology used in oVirt and would enable you to compare that to the ESXivCenter terminology.  The concept of Storage Domains is a slightly different approach than VMware storage which is where most are likely to get tripped up on first setup.RHEV Docs go quite a bit deeper than the oVirt documentation but is very specific to running RHEV on RHEL vs other Linux Distributions.The IRC channel is ovirt on irc.oftc.net Im sherold there,redhat,cfiworh,2,t5_2qulz

4923223,0,t3_3ibzam,Containers on Linux are a complete endrun around VMwares technology amp business model.  Hundreds of apps can run multitenant on a single server virtualization is entirely optional.  Virtualization at scale is orders of magnitude less efficient amp more costly than containers at hyperscale.  Containers are built on Linux LXC cgroups selinux kernel namespaces and Googles Kubernetes contribution.  You know the buckamonth hosting companies?  All of Googles free amp business apps?  All on containers for years try to imagine either the technology or the business model scaling with VMs.  VMware lost a ton of customer goodwill with their platform lockin amp contract ratcheting business model people are choosing alternative open technologies to avoid cloud or container lockin.   yrs ago Sun Microsystems was on top of the Unix game somehow they withered away with barely a whimper.  yrs ago I wouldve killed to work at VMware today I dont return their recruiter calls.  Sadly for VMware I see absolutely no compelling nextgeneration architecture and no sustainable competitive advantage.  Yall had a good run guys.  Say goodnight.,redhat,cuf3zu8,10,t5_2qulz

5448668,0,t1_cw7y7bd,Honestly Im not sure I can think of anything too bad  and Ill tell you why. Anytime Ive had any issue with something if I can think of a way to resolve that issue Ive raised it with the relevant people and its either been sorted or Ive been told why it cant be sorted in the way I envisaged i.e. maybe because of factors I dont have visibility of and generally people are happy to work with you to find a solution that works for both parties. If I had to say anything  and I think it was mentioned elsewhere  but sometimes you can suffer from information overload. There are so many passionate knowledgeable people in this organisation that whenever you have a question or need help there is always an abundance of ways to get it and an even greater number of people who can and do try to help. ,redhat,cw84brs,1,t5_2qulz

6654329,0,t1_d06zesq,Having taken several of the exams provided by Red Hat including a few versions of the CSA I can say it is deceptively simple. Obviously I cant go into detail but none of the things theyre asking you to do in the exam are things you wont have encountered as a junior sysadmin for a linux environment of the same major release. That said there are a lot of things in the exam and it only takes making a mistake early and not realizing it until the end or at all to result in a failing grade. In fact one of the more common ways to fail many of the exams is to have an environment that wont boot due to some simple boneheaded mistake and either not realizing it read testing for it before you submit or not having the time to fix it. And theres nothing worse than seeing the  score on your test results because of something like that. So definitely take it seriously.edit check out the Red Hat page on this to review the objectives list. Any and all of these objectives COULD be on the test ,redhat,d07m5qq,2,t5_2qulz

7389312,0,t3_4fakoe,Ive gone through his video course and Im attending the official day training at the moment. I think he overlaps like  with the official material but some topics he doesnt cover or doesnt cover them very well setting up ldapkerberos connections and some things he just adds even if they arent in the materials like mounting disks through systemd units. I think its a good start and if you know everything perfectly from his lessons I guess youll be able to pass not ace it but pass. Id combine it though. Go through his videos as a selfstudy then go through the book quickly stoping at things youre seeing for the first time. Then you should be totally fine. ,redhat,d2i44ih,1,t5_2qulz

At a minimum I would expect to be given a headsup from my TAM or other known Red Hat employee that I would be contacted.

9256995,0,t3_570q3o,Also is there something else I could do to help me prepare for the exam and in general look good on a resume?ampnbspAside from studying your course material Id say use CentOS or RHEL as often as you can use it as your main OS or at least dualboot. Its amazing how much you can passively learn when you use something constantly. As far as something that looks good on a resume participation in opensource projects always looks good. Fedora an upstream of RHEL is always looking for volunteers to help in varying capacities. Working on Fedora has actually resulted in several volunteers eventually being employed by Red Hat.

9744331,0,t3_5eetxk,The growth has actually exploded compared to this time last year. Similar growth was reported last year in relation to  years ago. The OpenStack adoption trend is growing both the industry as a whole and Red Hat see increasing numbers of customers using it and increased number of production deployments not just PoCs. A large contributor of growth this year has been the telco adoption of NFVSDN features of OpenStack.To cite some publicly available sources to back this up consider these Red Hat amp Ericsson partnership on OpenStack Other publicly available customer successadoption stories on Red Hat OpenStack investors.redhat.com  financial reports with respect to products Specifically QFY  YoY growth of Emerging Technologies products Openshift OpenStack CloudForms of   growth YoY in Emerging Technologies subscription revenueSo suffice to say the OpenStack market is experiencing substantial growth trends and we certainly see that within Red Hat.Granted the recent layoff news you mentioned these are my own personal opinions I think the HPE  Mirantis layoffs are more related to the repositioning of those two companies product offerings and in some parts corporate identity. HPE with the recent sale has begun deciding whats a core asset and what isnt and that activity has forced changes within the company. Mirantis seems to be shifting to a cloud provideroperator company and may not see being a cloud builder as core to their business as they previously did. I suspect we might see development of their Fuel installer to shrink and eventually die off as other open source projects with more diverse communities are establishing the future of the installer market and are better positioned to innovate quickly.
