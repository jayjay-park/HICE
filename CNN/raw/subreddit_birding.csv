I know as a fact that people are going there from the south of England to see it and well an American coot is an uglier version of our coots here. Id certainly drive an hour or so to see a frigatebird but what makes someone do a  hour drive to see a frumpy looking coot!Part of me thinks it would be interesting to have a list but part of me worries about becoming one of those guys who is wrapped up in getting lifers and ticks in their note pad rather than enjoying seeing what is around you.,birding,cf74zbn,2,t5_2qliv

998870,0,t1_chhtfzd,Relax  as you said it takes time. When I described my mother using the hose to water plants and attract hummingbirds I was also describing a pretty ideal wildlife yard that in fairness was already well established before we moved in. My folks live in a rural fairly wild part of western Canada so they already have that advantage. There are mature trees all around the yard and they leave the grassshrubs wild around the edges to provide nice cover. The former owners grew a massive honeysuckle vine on the flagpole on the deck yes a deck flagpole! along with the native honeysuckle and wild columbine that grows at the edges of the yard this is a hummingbird magnet. Mom puts up hanging baskets of nectar flowers during the summer and encourages native plants. Dad lets the birds and other critters eat the vast majority of their grapes from the vines. They have a birdbath and use the hose for misting and there are some creeks not far away. There are two nice woodpiles for snakes spiders and other critters to hide in plus a massive tangle of aggressive blackberries at the back of the garden for quailrabbitssmall birds to shelter in. There are lots of rocks and boulders scattered around for more cover and habitat for bugs and lizards.      Though my folks and I have done a lot to help improve the yard as wildlife habitat much of the work was already done by the former owners time and a good location. Just keep on doing bits at a time and eventually youll have a fantastic diverse yard!,birding,chhtuxa,1,t5_2qliv

Parental instinct is very strong in nesting birds and looking at or even approaching a nest is highly unlikely to cause her to abandon it. While it is generally the best practice to leave a nest alone bird nests can endure a fair amount of disturbance particularly those built on or near houses without prompting abandonment.

8530312,0,t3_4wjvwk,I havent seen many SPOW but this looks like a barred owl to me.  Barred Owls should be much more common in that area as well these days.  Someone with more experience with these guys may help confirm the ID.,birding,d67upsj,6,t5_2qliv

8593620,0,t3_4xisua,Not sure if directly relating birding but I have seen so so many cats roaming around the county in my limited time out of the house this week. All I can think of is how they decimate the bird population every time I see one slinking around  I even took a picture of one at McDonalds and my friends were proud to inform me its clipped ear meant it had been caught spayed or neutered and released back into the wild. What the hell.,birding,d6fskd0,2,t5_2qliv
8646976,0,t3_4xzwxa,So whats the prognosis here...eventual selfhealing certain death or somewhere in between.  Luckily healing with or without treatment is pretty much guaranteed with my  and  year olds. ,birding,d6mhex7,1,t5_2qliv
8663641,0,t1_d6nimhx,Every Least Bittern I have seen is an incidental result of spending hundreds of hours in wetlands. If i had to find one the odds are the same as winning a scratch off lotto ticket.Here in OK we have a super rare dark morph the Corys Least Bittern. The man who found it surveys that wetland every week for about  years and he has seen two Corys Least Bitterns. ,birding,d6okn9l,2,t5_2qliv

9470957,0,t3_5af999,Alot of people are saying Central Park but unless something rare shows up there keep an eye on ebird and listservs Id actually skip it. The coast is really where its at in NYC in the winter. CPK during that time of year will have pretty much nothing you wont be able to get elsewhere. Pine groves at Rodmans Neck and Hunter Island in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx will be your best shot at the owls. I have had Sawwhet Barred Barn Greathorned and Longeared all there. Plus the coastal birding around Hunter Island is excellent as you can get waterfowl of many species in the thousands there. Id also highly recommend Point Lookout and the west end of Jones Beach for things like Harlequin Duck all  scoters Purple Sandpiper Snow Bunting Lapland Longspur C. Eider Gannet Razorbill etc. Other good places are Breezy Point Fort Tilden and Jamaica Bay. Titmouse and Whitethroated Sparrow are pretty much guaranteed almost anywhere you go. The redpolls crossbills and the grosbeak will all be longshots unless you go way north of the city. You basically have to be around in an irruption year to have any chance at those. Bohemian Waxwing is super rare in NYC. Bring a scope!! Let me know if you have any other questions.,birding,d9gi1ag,3,t5_2qliv
9532285,0,t3_5bffaj,Theres a huge waxwing invasion in my country going on currently. Theyre usually quite scarce winterbirds but sometimes there will be an influx and well see hundreds of them. I went out looking for some in my city but unfortunately came out empty handed. Ill try again later because the influx is far from over! I did see a Grey Wagtail.,birding,d9o1yn3,3,t5_2qliv
9605328,0,t1_d9wwbbs,Agreed usually if I see rarities its one at a time or two if Im lucky and a lot of the time someone has seen them or will see them after me. I also always try to provide descriptions or photos for the weird stuff even if it isnt flagged as rare to add a little credibility to the sightings so people dont think Im a fluffer. The people you really notice it with are the ones that have birds in weird spots. For instance that woman I mentioned put a Pileated Woodpecker on her list from a spot that is totally not the right habitat and is heavily birded and AFAIK nobody else has ever seenheard one there. Theyre only found in one or two spots in my county as we are kinda on the border of their range in my state.,birding,d9x1xj3,1,t5_2qliv

9837126,0,t1_dapsfa7,If you band them when they are young the toes are much smaller? I was thinking maybe this one got banded wrong and they left it like that. Then it grew up with deformed broken toes.Yeah you are right that if the toe fits in there the band is the wrong size. Thats why I said I thought it was bandedbut incorrectly.,birding,dapstd1,1,t5_2qliv

10224382,0,t3_5m9jxa,Im positive thats not his tongue  duck tongues dont look like this Ive dissected many.To me it looks like some kind of fleshy outgrowth. Since these birds are piscivorous I would venture to guess that it swallowed someones fishing bait and the hook got stuck. Ive seen cases like this where it pokes through the soft tissue of the throat. It doesnt always kill the bird but it certainly would cause a lot of discomfort. ,birding,dc2zopb,2,t5_2qliv

10393068,0,t3_5ou4xv,I stayed at the Tropical Education Center thats paired with the Belize Zoo a few years ago and was lucky enough to get to go on a sunrise nature walk with a birding expert. I dont recall his name but if you can find someone local to take you out do it! This guy was so knowledgeable he was identifying birds by their calls and the tiniest glimpse through the brush. ,birding,dcm4cef,1,t5_2qliv

10610918,0,t3_5rtjgz,To add on to thegreatpt and GuavaTrees great advice get a good field guide for your region such as Sibleys and Petersons Birding by Ear to learn the calls and songs. Both have been invaluable to me as a selftaught birder. When you go birding with a field guide you shouldnt grab your book as soon as you see something. When you get your eyes on a bird study it for as long as you can before looking it up. It sounds corny but I sort of dictate what Im seeing out loud like mostly brown with wing bars pale gray belly and white patch on throat. It helps me remember the details when I start flipping through my book. And learning bird calls and songs is important because it will alert you to what birds are nearby and then youll know what youre looking for. Some birds that Ive marked down in my guide are ones Ive ONLY heard and havent seen yet such as Baltimore Oriole American Redstart Veery various warblers vireos and owls to name a few.I think the camera vs binoculars is purely a matter of personal preference I use binoculars because I dont have a powerful enough lens. ,birding,ddafogi,3,t5_2qliv
10624976,0,t3_5s1qmu,First potential record. If it turns out it was a caged bird like the one in California a few years back it wont be accepted. ,birding,ddbvvmc,9,t5_2qliv

10690996,0,t3_5swvsc,I havent used the Spirits or Endeavor xs but Ive had a pair of Endeavor ED xs for a few years and theyre fantastic! The field of view angles on the Endeavors are pretty wide . on the xs versus . on the Spirits. The near focus distance is also really close on the Endeavors listed as . ft on the link you posted more like  ft with the x ones in my experience. I just tested reading a  pt font label using a tape measure to measure the distance and I could read it at . ft away but I do have young eyes that maybe can take more strain than some older peoples eyes. They also are very comfortable to use when wearing glasses and I always keep the eye cups all the way down. One disadvantage of the Endeavors is that they are a bit heavier by g .oz in this case.Im really happy with my Endeavors x though and the Spirits seem pretty similar to me so Id say it really depends on if youll be carrying them long distances i.e. hiking weight difference observing large groups of birds or other instances where a larger field of view is necessary Id say its always nice trying to focus on rails under boardwalks or other birds up close and how much youre willing to spend considering the Endeavors are about  more than the Spirits.Unfortunately I havent had experience with both so I cant directly compare the two but I hope my input helped with your decision nonetheless. I can post a few pictures of birds taken with my Nexus  through my binoculars if youd like. That might show how good the contrast is but I dont know if you have pictures through other binocular to compare to.,birding,ddip45o,2,t5_2qliv
