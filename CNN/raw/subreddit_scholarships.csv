677374,0,t3_21veg4,You may want to read this post I wrote last year  Next be sure your website has a dedicated landing page for the award and spells out eligibility award amount deadline and clearly lists a privacy policy explaining what you will do with any personal information you collect. Next use social media Facebook twitter Google etc. to promote your scholarship daily. Once you have everything in place contact all the major scholarship search services ScholarshipExperts Fastweb Cappex Petersons CollegeBoard Scholarships.com Zinch Wintergreen Orchard House etc and send them the details of your award. Some sites have an online form that you can use to submit the award for consideration and others can be done with a simple email. It can take several weeks to have it added so start well before your deadline to get the most traffic possible. Finally make sure you give me the link so I can help promote it too. If you have any questions feel free to message me.,scholarships,cgh9ndy,2,t5_2t96d

2599901,0,t3_2pi66q,You are a great student. It pays to be methodical. Make it a habit to look everyday starting with your college sources and branching out to here. Process looks a little like no no no no hell no no no YES but oops the deadlines past so I put that in the file for next year. no no no no no no YES! Apply.Read the policies yearly monthly weekly .... Can you apply again? Keep track of that.Dont reinvent the wheel. If you write an essay save it. Many can be retweeked for use later. Plan to spend at least  minute on this daily. Good luck.,scholarships,cmxy02r,3,t5_2t96d

3240535,0,t3_2x29me,Please read this post  Even if you dont include your parents income and info on the FAFSA you still have options and should file it. You need to contact the colleges financial aid office and provide documentation to support that you have been on your own basically since . You may not be eligible for Pell Grants and still considered dependent but the college will be able to provide you with institutional needbased aid and youll have access to federal loans. When you were in high school a counselor could have certified that you were in danger of being homeless and selfsupporting if your parents threw you out and left you to fend for yourself which would have allowed you to file under independent status. When searching for scholarships I recommend ScholarshipExperts.com and Cappex.com.,scholarships,coxvzxy,1,t5_2t96d

6695714,0,t3_4781f9,First dont start your essay with I need this scholarship because.... Too many students do that and you want to be unique. Begin with a hook to draw the reader in and write with honesty from your heart.  Dont think of it as bragging but share how you are proud of your accomplishments.  Scholarship essays are a students chance to shine for the judges so dont hold back. You can find lots more scholarship essay help here  Good luck!  ,scholarships,d0bw82d,4,t5_2t96d
