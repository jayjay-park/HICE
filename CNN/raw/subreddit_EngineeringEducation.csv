8445857,0,t1_d5x95p5,Well that is seemingly the issue. They are such different fields engineering makes sense things are fast and efficient sometimes and you are treated with a lot of responsibility and respect.Teaching is like the polar opposite things just dont make sense a lot of the time. And then theres the bureaucracy of education..For instance I am the expert in my technology class at my last job despite being the expert I heard the admin talking about how insulting it was that they offered the science teacher my position before i got hired. No one really gets our subject. They think tech classes are a joke and not tough its not seen as equal....And its so demeaning I would love to see some core teachers teach middle schoolers Inventor or solidworks it LOOKS so simple when you see the simple D model but the process of learning the program is so difficult for middle schoolers...There is also the fact that despite being the classroom teacher the admin decided to buy random things like a flight simulator....wasting money despite me urging to buy a laser cutter or a CNC they went with that...it makes no sense some schools just decide things for the teachers.I think there is not enough trust going from Engineering to teaching sometimes I just think im gonna go right back to drafting  design because its so frustrating.On another note I was offered a teaching position at a university despite being  and a first year teacher to teach dimensioning and tolerancing as well as solid modeling. The reason? They said they were having such a hard time finding an engineer because of salary issues.So I would consider myself to be a good teacher with the necessary technical background to help kids make engineering not so scary. I think we should have just went with Engineering over STEM we make engineering terrifying and STEM classes end up focusing on the S and M NEVER The T or E. My classes main focus is on the E.However its very frustrating not to feel valued since I was part of a small design team before this and we were doing awesome projects i do love teaching though its not my only career I suppose. Looking forward to seeing the subreddit grow for sure.,EngineeringEducation,d5x9q5j,1,t5_3fnz3
