Lords made sure that their peasants stayed loyal to the land they lived on and kept them ignorant of most things that occurred outside their land. I think that nationalism is more something that occurs between citizens and people of a nation not much as servants or peasants or serfs who were oppressed and forced into servitude for the betterment of the local nobilitylords.PS Just my two cents feel free to teach me otherwise P,EmpirePowers_HRE,cthcgtk,1,t5_39060
