6964174,0,t1_d13h6h2,gt they dont seem to recognize that patronizing language and paternalistic guidance are active ingredients in modern more subtle forms of bigotry.Yeah its like when liberals tell Caitlyn Jenner who is a hard line republican supporter she doesnt know whats best for her.  Thats totally being driven by transphobia.  Or when liberals say white southerners who vote republican dont know whats best for them.  Obviously racism drives that.,BroadCity,d15q3o1,-1,t5_2t53a

7206932,0,t1_d1wfsmn,My husband and I just rewatched Knockoffs and our conclusion is roughly this Abbi sees herself with a guy like Jeremy but shes actually comfortablehappy with a guy like Trey. There seems to be a sense of shame from Abbi and like this feeling that shes better then Trey. Her freak out with Jermey over the initial suggestion of pegging and even her pride over having done it contrasted against how confident she was with Trey in the shower in telling him she hadnt finished sort of shows how intimacy with Jermey was lots of pressure and anxiety but with Trey shes comfortable. Im not sure if that actually makes any sense. Its like shes able to be at ease with Trey because she doesnt take it seriously and it isnt a relationship she envisioned for herself despite the fact that hes sweet and supportive. Meanwhile Jermey was a pretentious and self righteous and at the first sign of any conflict he basically kicked Abbi out of his apartment and out of his life. See also I am maybe projecting because I for sure spent most of my life picturing myself with a certain type of guy and the man I ended up marrying is nothing like that and simultaneously totally perfect for me. The type of guy I thought I should be with was a jerk and totally wrong my brain just spent a lot of time lying to me about it. Haha.,BroadCity,d1xdd0s,24,t5_2t53a

8257927,0,t3_4sjj3x,Couldnt agree more. Also more New York than Sex and the City Seinfeld Real Housewives of New York City Gossip Girl  Broke Girls and occasionally Girls.Love Broad City for keeping it REAL. The thing is living in NYC is really weird even uncomfortable but those many many irksome moments are absurdly brilliant... or at the very least pretty damn funny at the end of the day. Its an unpredictable existence that forces an individual to adapt and get really clever to outsmart the next curveball that NYC and its people will undoubtedly throw at you. Its a lot. Theres a great deal personal and interpersonal growth that occurs as time goes on. I think the show especially the last episode represents this aspect of NYC life very well.,BroadCity,d59sqdo,23,t5_2t53a
