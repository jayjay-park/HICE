I studied a lot about diffrent genocides and mass murders Congo Free State Cambodian killing fields ect. Additionally I studied and read a lot about the affects of capitalism and imperialism on places like Africa developing a strong social democratic stance as well a a philisophical anarchist one. Eventually I decided to read some anarchist literature and I became enmoured. Since then Ive gone from syndicalist to communist with emphasis on individualism. ,LeftWithoutEdge,d2f1cxm,1,t5_3bgym

7540625,0,t3_4ilza6,Im down with people who think their country has good wellfunctioning institutions a commitment to human rights and fundamental equality and so on and therefore put in a good word for how their country does things. Ultimately though Im not sure if that could be called nationalism in any sense of the word. Even putting aside my personal opposition to nationstates for a moment human rights good institutions a fair society and all the rest arent a zerosum game as we should hope that everyone is able to live in a place with them. I believe that to think your country is better than others  that its worth focusing on as the ideal as opposed to all those other things  misses the point at best and can lead to ugly sentiment at worst.,LeftWithoutEdge,d2zbzgq,3,t5_3bgym

8184834,0,t1_d50n5ae,Marxgt Among the ancients we discover no single inquiry as to which form of landed property etc. is the most productive which creates maximum wealth. Wealth does not appear as the aim of production although Cato may well investigate the most profitable cultivation of fields or Brutus may even lend money at the most favorable rate of interest. The inquiry is always about what kind of property creates the best citizens. Wealth as an end in itself appears only among a few trading peoples  monopolists of the carrying trade  who live in the pores of the ancient world like the Jews in medieval society. . . .gt Thus the ancient conception in which man always appears in however narrowly national religious or political a definition as the aim of production seems very much more exalted than the modern world in which production is the aim of man and wealth the aim of production. In fact however when the narrow bourgeois form has been peeled away what is wealth if not the universality of needs capacities enjoyments productive powers etc. of individuals produced in universal exchange?,LeftWithoutEdge,d50nl2d,2,t5_3bgym
8230323,0,t3_4ryjol,OK lets begin. First of all I am pleased beyond measure that the extreme right wing hasnt picked up on the lunacy amongst the pseudoanarchists on reddit who think anarchism is nothing but tough talk on the internet. Theyve picked up on other things and the general conservative media has as well but the complete insanity expressed in much of r and even more so on the sharp fbi site hasnt made into the general internet chatter. I hope this continues. I really hope. Ive been scanning the right wingers for the last few days. They have more important fish to fry than a bunch of white adolescents or adolescents who never grew up on the internet. They are picking and choosing from real black people as expected rather than psychotic white kids on the internet. They have their enemies after all and the list of their enemies goes right up to the president and all the conspiratorial nonsense they accuse him of.So its both good and bad in that the right wing loons havent taken advantage of the bullshit on reddit. It may be a standard demonstration of how irrelevant such chat boards are to the real world. Yet it always stands as an opportunity that can be exploited at any time. Hopefully the enemy will never see the need.In any case Im going to pull my age card here however much I hate to do it. Id urge people to look back on the history of cointelpro something I lived through as the FBI quite deliberately fostered the most insane and violent tendencies amongst the New Left and especially the black movement with the intent of destroying them. It worked. Big time !If you desire you can read all about it just as you can read about the police agents who have entrapped so many dumb little anarchist children over the past two decades with traps of terrorist direct action. Its all in the public domain. So much of this is a repeat of what happened in the early s.Heres the age card. I met Fred Hampton once. An incredibly dedicated decent intelligent well spoken moral person. Unlike his socalled petty criminal FBI agent body guard who drugged him before the night he was murdered. Why was he murdered ? Because he wasnt an idiot who spouted the political correctness of the day. He attempted and very much succeeded in building alliances across races black Latino and white. That is why the FBI determined he had to be killed and why they supported divisive nationalist groups amongst the black community. That is why the actual authors of the murder of Malcom X were never prosecuted. Because he had come to see reality and the need for alliances across races. Thats a bad thing from the point of view of the FBI. Much greater a bad thing than kill whitey from a white loon because that serves their purposes.Once more the age card. I can remember Hamptons murder. He had visited us. When he was killed we had the standard and required riot with ten times the numbers that the anarcholoons can muster. No blacks or almost none. Just natives and whites. Of course it accomplished nothing. But at the time natives and working class whites were united unlike what the uberwhite politically correct brigade want.Thats it for now. ,LeftWithoutEdge,d56chsx,9,t5_3bgym

9302475,0,t1_d8v4u5c,Pensions are property so Im not sure what you meant there. Its true that property and your body are different though I think most people would prefer a sort of violence to their pension to being assaulted by police in the streets. Ideally we wouldnt live in a world where both are serious dangers hence the socialist movement.To be clear I think this kind of stunt is entirely useless and will only help genuinely reactionary forces. I just find it hard to get upset at someone who snaps and does this sort of thing.See this Contra the title there is nothing insane about what this guy wrote before he flew his Cessna into an IRS building. That part about an elderly widow suggesting cat food to survive because as her husbands pension was stolen from him she had to rely on it? Fuck.

11026130,0,t3_5xfvuq,This is all in response to a ridiculously terrible Vanity Fair article that has predictably been highly praised by the very bitter ESSHillary stan contingent on Reddit where they graphically discuss how they want to murder Bernie Sanders supporters for supposedly throwing the election or whatever.I want to give my usual routine about liberalism here and make a few related points. Liberalism the modern post New Deal sort not the classical liberalism of J. S. Mill so commonly butchered by rightlibertarians is a dying ideology that has only ever been powerful when it served as a capitalist safety valve releasing the social pressures built up by a powerful socialist and communist movement. When it is responding to the Left it has some measure of vitality and intellectual substance I posted J.K. Galbraiths The Age of Uncertainty here a while ago and was quite astounded by how subtle and even radical parts of it were. However ever since the collapse of the American socialist movement in the s and s and in particular since the collapse of the Soviet Union a generation ago which provided no real strong moral or economic challenge for decades at that point anyway liberals have been primarily responding to the right wing to their detriment. It is one thing to provide a less risky compromise to the politics of revolution. It is quite another to merely dedicate yourself to crushing the working class a little more slowly or to smile while doing so. This has led a to a hollowing out of the Democratic policycreating apparatus a breakdown in the formation of new ideas the abandonment of whole swathes of the population with a smug where else are you gonna go? attitude and in general a total collapse in intellectual and moral integrity. This much is clear to any informed observer of politics and the electoral results dont lieWe can even follow a sort of history of groups responding to each other for a few decades when liberalism was ascendant after responding successfully with more than a little help from violent State repression to the Left a whole tradition of intellectual conservatives arose to respond to it in turn attempting to move past the old open oligarchy and praise of unregulated markets and cold indifference to the poor. The first major sign of liberalisms decline might have been the quick dieout of these intellectual conservatives after Reagan and their replacement with vulgar hacks who didnt even deign to hide their open bigotry or Gekkolike greed  why bother when liberalism was quickly losing the ability to challenge those things? The class of intellectual conservatives today includes David Brooks himself closer and closer to a caricature and a tiny handful of others they serve primarily as a way for liberals to feel like they are reading and respecting different opinions which is why they inhabit places like The New York Times instead of writing for newspapers that conservatives actually read. And now liberalism is following in the footsteps of the vanishing Brooksian tribe.Until and if for there is no guarantee liberalism regains a sense of moral justice and a desire to engage with its socialist critics you can expect the following tactics to be used almost exclusively substancefree mocking smearing doxxing and attempts to get people fired or ostracized from their friends and family and attempts to silence and noplatform critics. They dont have ideas and they dont have arguments so this is what they are reduced to. Its a very poor hand to be playing and I suspect many of them know it but they dont have a choice in the matter. So one thing they keep pushing are idiotic comparisons between socialists and neoNazis  and a big part of this is the forced attempt to make altleft a meme. If we are the altleft then were just as bad as the altright dont you know? Only those in the middle are smart and reasonable and everyone else is dumb and evil.Fight back against this nonsense. Reframe arguments to be about justice amp freedom. Point out the awful smear and silencing tactics in lieu of of actual argument and debate  start pushing actual ideas. Liberals have little or no responses to any of these things and they will get quickly frustrated no matter youre arguing to audiences not people tied to a quickly dying ideology. We can and will make inroads with those who are wavering in their beliefs.,LeftWithoutEdge,dehscde,40,t5_3bgym
