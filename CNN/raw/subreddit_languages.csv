2773056,0,t1_cnig52y,while sunrisetrue       beautifultrueHow do you think putting dates on files works? you use the programming language to tell the computer it was created then.Computers cannot interpret language flexible because of their physical limitations. A computer cannot communicate flexibly because it cannot think flexibly. In a conversation with an autistic person you may have to redefine concepts when you are using a real language flexibly. Additionally some languages contain gestures andor nonverbal communication that cannot be expressed properly through the medium of text while the written form of the language is considered just as valid. Based on the medium and the limitations of your communication you may have to go to the same lengths programmers must to communicate clearly and flexibly while using a flexible language. To categorise a method of communication based on the limitations of those who use it seems silly to me.,languages,cnjabdn,1,t5_2qrrf

7544726,0,t1_d2k9wts,probably his neighboring country Learning Dutch is like learning German except there are no rules only exceptions. You will also find it difficult to practice because most ppl you will encouter will switch to french Belgium or english depending on your native tongue. You will need to repeat and insist with every person you encouter that you want in fact to practice. Other then that you may find that native speakers tend to string together the whole phrase making it hard to follow.Not to discourage you P. If you manage to master it prepare for a huge deal of appreciation with the local community because you are one of the few who master it enough so the others dont switch automatically.,languages,d2zsr9b,1,t5_2qrrf

7920651,0,t3_4myzq7,what makes me want to learn languages or one language in particular is my fascination for words grammar and how all the letters are pronounced differently in many languages. my former english teacher was very passionate about languages and gave her passion to me. so its very good for me if i can feel my teacher teaches me that language with passion. i also started learning spanish last year and we focus more on talking than on only learning the grammar rules but i still got a feeling for the grammar. all of this was very effective for me.,languages,d46ctmb,2,t5_2qrrf
