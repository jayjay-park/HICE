4444948,0,t3_3byw07,You may be interested in this tutorial  It shows how to write a reusable counter a reusable grid and then how to wire them together as in a grid of counters.That said I do think that a form tutorial would be cool. The way Id attack your form is as follows Make a container component that goes from one step of the form to the next as in with actions like next page previous page Have the container component have a property called fields which would be a List Bool a where the bool tells you if the field is required and the a is the type of the field components. Make a bunch of components for the different kinds fields your labeled inputs your date picker or input type date etc...I think from there you could work your way to a solution. The thing is youd want the container to somehow be able to tell that the childs input was faulty and thus refuse to go to the next page even if it was sent a nextpage action.,elm,csqyzkl,2,t5_2wn37
5631286,0,t1_cwund1o,I have found Haskell not so easy to learn but that was mostly because of the material and lack of guidance. Many people try to learn Haskell through LYAH that while teach functional thinking many felt they were unable to write Haskell after finishing it.Also solving project euler problems is a bad way to learn Haskell IMO which is another thing many myself included dodid.Fortunately this guide and the new Haskell Programming book are changing the scenery. And for guidance one can always visit the haskell and haskellbeginners channels on freenode and get help at any time of the day.I also find Haskell to be a better place to learn fp than elm because elm goes hand in hand with building GUI. In Haskell one can build all sorts of things cli programs shell scripts intepreters web servers emulators etc.Also the Haskell tools which can help you learn Haskell like the REPL hooglehayoo editor plugins etc are more advanced than elms though elms online editor gives a good experience and elms error messages are a lot more obvious than GHCs.To conclude for Haskell Stable environment Supportive community Learning resources Tools Variety of domainsfor Elm Less to learn online editor better error messages,elm,cwv44fr,3,t5_2wn37

6446335,0,t3_43x94a,Elm has no way to hide local state it has to go together with the rest. How I would solve this is to just model the apps behaviour fully and to have a convertor that takes the full model and outputs the essential model for the db operations.  ,elm,czm3akt,2,t5_2wn37
6734298,0,t3_47vkfj,gt Or whats the correct way to access an Elm record with the field name passed as a String?What should be the signature of this function    getByKey  String gt keyInt keyString gt ???    getByKey k r        magic k rwhat should it return? If you answer this question you can solve your issue. The way I view it you want a function that will return either an Int or a String while receiving the same kind of input and I dont think thats possible. If all keys have the same type the story is different.  ,elm,d0fvvj1,2,t5_2wn37

8039254,0,t3_4pc1il,Minor nitpick but the smart container dumb component paradigm is from Redux not React. This concept is important in Redux because by default all React components have the ability to set their own local state. Redux on the other hand discourages local state and attempts to store ALL state in a global state object. Pieces of the global state object are then passed down to various child components. The beauty of this approach is that most of your components will end up being pure. Pure components are easier to understand test and reason about. In addition purity also allows the developer to replay actions for debugging purposes.Elm is already a pure language and its purity is enforced by the compiler. Its simply not possible to have local state inside an Elm component since Elm components are just pure functions. Therefore all Elm components are dumb components. The only smart component in your app will be your main function.,elm,d4jorco,6,t5_2wn37

9593757,0,t1_d9ux30d,gt abitrary order in the source codeI dont really see why it would be arbitrary but tossing that aside you obviously would never use this list directly. The constructor names cant have space or arbitrary capitalization and are often unfit for enduser consumption. A more complete solution would look like that    data Foo  Bar | Baz deriving Eq Enum Bounded    fooDescription  Foo gt Text    fooDescription f  case f of            Bar gt The important bar option            Baz gt The not so important baz option    fooPriority  Foo gt Int    fooPriority f  case f of            Bar gt             Baz gt      allOptions  Foo    allOptions  sortBy comparing fooPriority minBound .. maxBoundIt is a bit more code but it is safe and easy to understand and expand. The Enum typeclass gives me a mapping between Foo and Int that I can use to give an identifier to the options in the select box and the fooDescription a human readable text.gt You are asking for the language to be more complicated so that you can write a bad solution which reduces some code maintenance in a relatively small problem area.I am not asking Elm to change. As I said I think I understand what spot it occupies and understand that andThen or map will be different for every type that applicative operators will never be in core and more importantly that I will never be able to write something comparable.The Haskell solution isnt bad. It is cleaner and safer than the manually maintain a list option. Finally it is alright to have strong opinions on language design but it would be better to also have an idea of what the solution space looks like before dismissing other approaches.,elm,d9vml0c,2,t5_2wn37

9664892,0,t3_5dglog,UpdatePending has type MovieAttribute gt Msg so you should give it a value of type MoveAttribute but you gave it Title a value of type String gt MovieAttribute. You probably want UpdatePending ltlt Title.That is your type error but thats not the error message you get. Im guessing that Elm sees that youre giving UpdatePending an argument and so before even looking at this argument it concludes that the type of UpdatePending Title is Msg and so it complains that you gave it a Msg when it wants a String gt Msg. If you used UpdatePending Title in a place which does expect a Msg I bet the type checker would continue its checks it would finally take a look at the argument and it would complain that Title has type String gt MovieAttribute but UpdatePending expects a MovieAttribute.,elm,da4ef79,2,t5_2wn37

I have several different places where data can be persisted and Id like the messaging experience to be consistent without repeating myself too much in code.Actually now that I phrase it that way a view helper function may be most appropriate.
