9589271,0,t1_d9v2bzl,To be honest my plan is to try and generate enough water to receive our independence from AK and NV water. More than anything else it would be required and it would become a national project like the eire canal the hoover dam and rural electrification. While not cheap it would be worth it not just for independence but to give California the autonomy it needs to become independent from the rest of the country.The other west coast states is an option there have been similair pushing of a Cascadia style secession. As far as how secession happens that will be up to time to tell. It is my goal not to make sure the united states wants our secession but instead to get ourselves in as secure a position to allow it to be possible. Even if full secession is not possible it is becoming increasingly clear that California needs significantly more autonomy from the tyranny of the electoral college.PS.
