1407862,0,t1_cisr46y,Yeah I feel that. Minecraft is weirdly soothing. And so for you are you most drawn to AH because of the subject matter or the people?,RTAH,cisr6zv,1,t5_32gix
1454140,0,t3_2apf9e,I didnt comment because we dont really have traditions for each separate episode.  We however usually wait until the entire season is out then have a binge session.,RTAH,ciyjv7k,1,t5_32gix
1898721,0,t3_2c48lx,I watch the show occasionally but frankly it isnt anything new. They dont seem to have much of a way to differentiate themselves from the rest of the news shows on YT like sourcefed and Dnews. I honestly think their all you know show they recently launched will help them heaps as its a summary of the biggest stories during the week but if they did some kind of written or longer form video for their stories that would be great. The stories never seem to fleshed out and seem to be mainly going oh hey this happened type videos and not indepth analysis and break downs of stories. ,RTAH,ckhzhm7,2,t5_32gix
