208296,0,t3_1wcwo3,So.. yeah totally didnt see that coming. I really thought that they had a plutonic relationship. Granted I think they did too. Looks like things are going to get shaken up. We are really starting to dig deeper in these characters and I love it so much. I felt SO bad for Sweet Potato at the end though. It was like he realized he was going to be fighting a much harder battle for the one he loved that he had even imagined. And I love him and Shing Shing together so much. They didnt have as many adorable moments in this episode as they did in the beginning but that is probably how things are going to be. They have a lot of challenges to face before they reach the end of this journey. Also as bad as I feel for Jung Hee Jae and her boyfriend I think she is just so freaking cute with Lee Woo Young. They really have great chemistry. And as of right now I really cant stand the idea of Kang Tae Yoon being with Oh Se Ryung. I just dont want to see them together. I am pretty sure they will end up that way so it will be interesting to see if the story eases into me accepting them.,KDRAMA,cf262f1,1,t5_2rqv6

It just gets too hard to follow. This was the first time I have run into it or at least the first time I was able to tell.

589712,0,t3_20vxi0,I finished my second kdrama yesterday Secret Garden. The first was My Love from the Star.  I must say I dont quite understand how Secret Garden can be so popular. The comedy elements were good in the same way as in My Love from the Star but the melodrama elements annoyed me quite a bit.  Also I believe that I would have enjoyed Secret Garden more if the main story was that of Oska and Seul. I was actually watching the drama and wishing for more OskaSeul interaction. If someone can recommend a kdrama with the OskaSeul plot Ill be more than interested!Its not that I dont enjoy a good crying and Ive seen a few kmovies that combine comedy with drama in a mix that appeal to me like Sunny Architecture  Il Mare My Sassy Girl and so on. But the two kdramas that Ive seen so far missed to move me at all. The drama parts are dragging on too long and the ever reoccurring weeping scenes are lacking the build up to make it effective. Okay the OskaSeul story moved me at some time and probably because it was more straight forward and more relatable to me.  But Im not giving up on kdrama yet.

She has that my son needs to be the best personality and whats better than her son being married to the Director of the local Hospital? Dad obviously isnt a shining example of a perfect person. I feel he inadvertently really became attached to Dylan and him viewing him as his son is sincere and not manipulative.

2112288,0,t3_2j3sxl,Ahh another Monday stuck at the office. I really dont feel like doing any work at the moment so I figured Id let out some of my Monday blues feelings here! Lets start with the good stuff. Ive recently bitten off way more than I can chew in the kshow department and am having trouble keeping up and staying afloat but I am working on catching up slowly. Rounding out my weekend me and a friend finally finished watching Its Okay Thats Love yesterday and I am all sorts of feels about it. The story and the development of the characters just felt so genuine as well as engaging and heartwarming. Even though I had literally just seen Gwang Su in a Running Man episode a week ago I felt like I knew his character in the show and that I was a part of that tightknit group of people. I felt that way about all of them. A lot of dramas make me incredibly salty when I just love two characters so much and just want to see them happy together for a while only to have a bunch of bad stuff happen in the middle and then only have them be together for a very brief part of the end of the last episode. I know a drama isnt a drama without... well... drama but sometimes its just nice to indulge in an overall happy story. This show was definitely that for me. It definitely had its fair share of serious and emotionally charged scenes and situations due to the psychological nature of the show alone but the show never resorted to throwing makjang situations into the mix to try and spice things up. It was all just very real and very imaginable life situations that people had to deal with and overcome. Also getting to see Jae Yuls and Hae Soos banter for the majority of the series had me smiling like an idiot for most of the time I spent watching. If anyone hasnt watched this series yet I highly recommend you check it out. Its very entertaining and if nothing else its actually somewhat educational as well. I left knowing a little bit more about psychological conditions than I ever intended to. This one definitely made it into the list of my favorite series and it will leave a drama sized hole in my heart for a long while Im sure. In other news ulifefindsaway somehow convinced me to start watching Boarding House  not actually surprised it does have Hyunyoung and cant for the life of me figure out what the hell that show is trying to do. I know that its supposed to be campy and corny but I feel like its layered on WAY too thick. I cant tell if the show is supposed to be satire or if its really just trying to be that dumb and that they thought that in doing so it would be really funny? The show has some rare actually funny moments but so far its really starting to remind me of a modern day Disney channel sitcom. Like the moment in the first episode I think the first? where Kwang Gyu drops the weight on his foot and it zooms into his overly animated face yelling out in pain... I just cant... And the laugh track. Dont even get me started on the laugh track. At this point the only reason Im going to come back for more is there have been some genuinely cute scenes like whatshisface and Dohee sharing the octopus and beer from the basket and Iets be honest its Dohee. I would watch Dohee reciting the dictionary satoori or not. Also another reason is because Im a bit shallow and Hyunyoung is a smokeshow... but we dont talk about that. Anyway if anyone can shed some light on what that drama is trying to accomplish in a light I havent seen yet please do  I really want to understand I do...That pretty much sums up my weekend as far as show watching goes. Other than that it was mostly games! Been getting deep into that Archeage! TLDR  Its Okay Thats Love. Boarding House . Archeage.,KDRAMA,cl8bf0p,1,t5_2rqv6

I almost sucked my SIL and brothers into it too haha.Someone said that the reason some people fell so hard for it was because it really felt like you were watching two people fall in love.

They all have issues all four of the major characters. Fairly significant issues. I mean even the second lead who is constantly trying to save the female lead gets the rug pulled out from under him basically because of that behavior.

4575322,0,t3_3dl52n,Spoiler warning just in caseI was expecting a low budget corny assassin girl with terrible acting and facepalmworthy special effects but Killer Girl K instead felt more of a three hour Quentin Tarantino movie with really well choreographed fight scenes and nowhere screaming low budget.  If I saw Quentin Tarantino in the credits I wouldnt have been surprised more like yeah knew it.  The acting was on point for the entire cast.  The evil scientist plot was just a setup for a story about a girl turned assassin lured in and blinded by her hate vs a league of assassins which was developed by taking advantage of an evil scientists money and thirst to get what he wanted.  The evil lady wasnt so much loyal as she liked being the head of this league of assassins and having power essentially being the top and who knows it looked like the evil scientist was developing something that could be of use to her.As for why the soldier who helped develop the SS but later left either this SS was never supposed to be a hit team to take out the scientists opponents and was initially just a really good security force or he really believed that the research could of been very beneficial for people in the future which it kinda was but wasnt expecting all the bad needed to get there.  He finally realized things got out of hand and not what he initially sign up for.There are definitely a lot of things that could have been further explored but I really liked how it was quick to the point didnt spend a lot of time showing her train and that it didnt just stop at the Killer Girl getting her revenge but to go forward and to show the realization that revenge shouldnt have been everything.  At the very least it was one really good action movieTV show and I really want to see a sequel with the same leading actress.The romance was awesome...boom he dead.  No long spiel of him finding out about her and trying to convince her to live a normal righteous life.  I was expecting things to turn boring with him doing a superhero act after finding out the truth about her but nope.  In the wise words of Jesse Pinkman boom bitch!  So unexpected but so good!  You may back away slowly and run if you so desire I do not blame youI was expecting though for the mom to put up more of a fight since she apparently taught her daughter how to fight.  And she was kinda stupid.  She should of stayed put and trust in the super trained guy who got her out of that evil scientists lab to begin with.  If theres anybody to trust getting your daughter back in one piece and alive its him.  But I guess the cell phone trick could throw a lot of rationality out of the window so cant  blame her.To conclude this essay it was interesting how they didnt really touch on if the assassin girl was genetically modified or not.  It kinda hinted at the beginning like she was but was she really?  Or was she just a quick learner since she already had fighting experience and hate is undoubtedly one strong motivation to press to the limits and get good fast?So glad this post was created been wanting to talk about this show but I watched it like years after it was released  Mmm...to answer your initial question...nope sorry dont feel you  .

I also think theyre going to throw in the pregnancy with Ji Yi but I dont like that direction at all. Its cliche and feels like a cop out to get Changsoo and Ji Yi together easily. Also I really dont like Ji Yi in this Episode . She just glosses over the fact that Joongi lied to her best friend. I get that hes poor and wanted to marry well... all right... but thats no excuse to fake being in love just to seduce Yoon Ha. Playing with peoples hearts is inexcusable whether he fell in love in the end or not. I dont get why him releasing the article was in the plot? It seems to have little to no significance to carrying forward the plot. I feel like Yi Ji wouldnt like Joongi as much if she knew he released the article... but I feel like the writers are just going to gloss over that detail too which is stupid. ,KDRAMA,ctezb4s,1,t5_2rqv6

I did remember there being a few hiccups when I first used it on Viki but I think I found the trick that made it work perfectly fine at some point...it was something like you need to push the Chromecast button on the lower right of the video then push Cast this tab on the Chrome toolbar most of the time on other sites you can just directly push Cast this tab and it works fine.,KDRAMA,cwe8du6,1,t5_2rqv6
5496918,0,t1_cwdtsmf,IIRC during the F special they aired around ep  when Goo HyeSun had her car accident Lee MinHo said that he had gotten some ridiculous number of perms like  or  to that point to keep his hair like that. I never know what to say when BOF gets brought up. Some love it some hate it but most have a little of both in their hearts. Ive been watching Kdramas since  or so and its among the most enjoyable and infuriatingly bad rides Ive ever had. It does get worse but keep watching! There are a few scenes here and there that are gold. I never recommend it to new watchers but love encouraging them once they start. A terrible showand great fun.

Even in the online age you can find at least six different magazines on any given subject. They would still get a lot of ad revenue. Whats with kdrama characters leaving their phones everywhere? As much as hes been on the phone this drama Im sure he would have noticed the silence. The staff got over him not telling them the magazine was in danger fairly quick.

6262972,0,t3_41cgps,Whenever this question comes up I pick History of A Salaryman. My gosh Jung Ryeo Won and Hong Soo Hyun really have comedic chops. Lee Bum Soo is of course his usual best. And the script is just so overthetop yet its funny because the show is fully aware of its exaggerated nature.Padam Padam is also another one I enjoyed. It didnt seem like many fans went crazy over the show. It definitely has star power in Han Ji Min and Jung Woo Sung  rare to see them on TV  and I just really enjoyed Jung Woo Sungs character. Wellwritten melodrama which had angst but not overkill.Also Smile You which is a family drama so its not mentioned as often among international Kdrama fans. I rarely have patience for episode long shows but I enjoyed this show so much. Jung Kyung Ho and Lee Min Jung were wonderful in this show. Lee Min Jung in particular shines in this role. It really shows that she excels when she plays certain types of characters  cheery bubbly never lets hardship get them down.

Whereas this plays it as more true to the text I think in that Jung hasnt gotten better hes just changed how he feels about Seol. Its just so strange to realise that he just does not understand really why he should be held accountable for how he used to feel. Like he has no understanding why Seol cant just get past it.

His story ended pretty early but its easily the most complete story. Whether or not he finds love or has a family would only matter if his wife was another character but no one would be satisfied if he ended up with any of the remaining single women. Delving into his love life with a new character would be frivolous. He is already living his dream so we can safely assume he lived happily ever after.It was a bit of a surprise that the focus shifted towards the end to Bora but I thought it worked out well.

I really loved the focus on family in this episode and I wanted to cry MANY times. I just wanna see Seol wake up a bit when it comes to In Ho. I know she is into Yoo Jung but it still feels forced to me.. I know it is different in the manga but the drama is  In Ho as far as I am concerned. I like her relationship with Yoo Jung but I enjoy the narrative much more if the end game is In Ho. Second Lead Syndrome my ass.

Man this episode.I predicated the grandmas death before the series even started so I was not caught off guard or anything but nonetheless it still hurt me deeply to see the grandma pass away. The grandma begging forgiveness to Seo Woos dad the grandma losing it after feeding Hye Jung in jail and her death  I was losing it. I really liked when Hye Jung found out the news and she began to cry and it closes up on PSHs face and you can see her hands shaking while shes crying that detail was strong in my opinion. Other things about this episode... Hye Jung and Soon Hee is still the true ship.. Just kidding but I really love their friendship and I am glad theyre still friends in the future!! Also Seo Woo is horrible. She feels no pity for anyone she only cares about herself. Even when she hears about Soon Hee being the one in jail she doesnt stop to think I should tell the truth. Also I am glad Yoon Do was finally introduced and I already know Im going to ship him and Hye Jung because second lead syndrome is always strong with me buuuut its going to cause even more problems between Hye Jung and Seo Woo. The feud will carry on unfortunately. ,KDRAMA,d4qbot8,8,t5_2rqv6
8108459,0,t3_4ph7vy,gtSo I believe he will definitely still get hit by the car. Originally if he didnt change the visions then he wouldve regretted and died there and then after being hit. However because he changed events and he is now together with OHY that will be the trigger that saves his life. Being together to OHY is the trigger.gtI still believe PDK will get hit no matter what though. Whether its by HTJ or not he will be hit.I guess I was wrong about me being wrong yesterday. tvN should just hire me. Im just going to give myself an internet cookie and a pat on the back for calling this weeks ago.Its been a good ride.

8566695,0,t1_d6cdhrf,I think you are right about KCs feelings not being love at this point.  Whatever is written into him that keeps him from seeing YJ as pretty is probably also going to prevent real love from developing for him as of now anyway.  It struck me that YJ seemed unconcerned about how KC would feel about her plans to change his story to a romance the bus scenes and that was affecting KCs feelings about her.  Maybe he realizes she now has the power to destroy everything and everyone in his world.  Those bus scenes made me see YJ as immature emotionally and that may have had an effect on everything else for me.Thanks for your opinions as these have made me rethink my first impression.

10325761,0,t3_5ntwpb,I didnt care for watching currently airing dramas but Goblin has sort of changed my mind about that. It works really well with my work schedule to watch two episodes a week and then pick up another completed series in between the live airings currently watching Shopping King Louie. I get my weekly fix in a small dose then can binge when I feel like it if and when work permits. I do not feel as drained at work due to my lack of self control when it comes to binging. I will probably start another airing drama after Goblin finishes its run. I also think this shift in my viewing habits is partially due to the production quality going up in . Of all the series I have watched I enjoyed the newer series from the last two years the most even though there are some great older dramas but some just look so dated that I cant get into them and I feel like the production quality is a big part of that. ,KDRAMA,dcehdhq,3,t5_2rqv6

I know when I tried to get my parents to watch a kdrama they were bugged a bit by the Korean but got over it in a couple episodes. However when I showed them a cdrama all they could talk about was the Chinese.What bugs me is dubbing. The dubbing never syncs to the actors mouth and it really pulls you out of the show.

10646827,0,t3_5scmgl,You know I just realized something.  KDramas tend to run  minutes without commercials while American shows tend to run around  minutes without commercials.  Lets say  minutes at a standard run of  episodes thats  minutes.  Divide that by  minutes and thats around  episodes which is generally the length of one American TV network season.  So its like one full season generally aired over the course of  months with several short breaks and one long winter break inbetween crammed into a period of like what two months?  Damn...!And yet I always get this feeling that American shows in one season cover more ground than in one season of a Korean drama.  Its not really an excuse but I can somewhat understand how a show sometimes feel like the writers just flipped a table near the end or that there is an unnecessary amount of flashbacks or things that I assumed were not supposed to be there appearing.  Its not like the entire show was preproduced before airing.  Quite a bit if not a majority are done while airing maybe weeks or even days before airing dare I say hours?.

Not that there werent repetitive plottwist attempts before but this one takes the crown.

Their cuteness was just too...much and not extremely melodramatic like other TV shows.,KDRAMA,dg143kf,2,t5_2rqv6
11527948,0,t1_dg2o1x6,Are you interested in Korean cooking? Do you know of any web sites with the recipes from Jewel in the Palace or Kimchi family?I have a kimchi inspired by kimchi family fermenting now I will open it later today. Radish leeks and carrots but of course without persimmon vinegar. The spring onion in the shop was so bad I had to buy leeks instead. ,KDRAMA,dg2p0u5,2,t5_2rqv6

11534913,0,t1_dg2912g,Given some of the bad writing in the drama its not a surprise the title is also bad. Still enjoying it though.,KDRAMA,dg3hgk6,3,t5_2rqv6
11554903,0,t1_dg552c5,Yup thats true. Japanese dramas I notice sometimes resemble real life more. They dont focus on multiple genres like Korean dramas and usually focus on one theme or topic. Theres usually no magical resolution or solution to problems like there are in Korean dramas. Maybe thats why Japanese dramas arent as popular? I still like them though. ,KDRAMA,dg5r33d,1,t5_2rqv6
11568776,0,t1_dg6eavb,I have seen both and never would have thought to compared them lol. The genres make them so different but you are right. They are very similar. Its been a while so I could be wrong but didnt the guy know it was the ghost and not the girl almost the whole time? And by main guy I mean the one the ghost wasnt engaged to. I always felt like he was the main character. Im trying to remember but I watched that drama so long ago.,KDRAMA,dg7bra8,1,t5_2rqv6

11610046,0,t1_dgbrgjs,This show was described as fantasy from the get go. It might appear that his editor is fooling him in thinking its just his imagination but the editor did talk with the ghostwriter so he knows he exists. Edit this got me curious so went back on that scene and the one in the presscon it can be interpreted as a one sided convo. He did interact with JS friend thoughBut itll be an interesting twist if in the end all of this is actually the novel itself like the movie Third Person.,KDRAMA,dgc0byp,1,t5_2rqv6
11614792,0,t3_65bz13,Im all caught up to Ep  and i have to say this drama is a pleasant surprise. I thought it was going to be darker and more past focused. It has a a nice balance and the story is interesting. I love how Jeon Seol couldve been a really bad Mary Sue fan girl but shes got some depth to her. Yoo Ah In is his usual beautiful self and Gyung Po  is fitting in nicely. ,KDRAMA,dgcjozj,2,t5_2rqv6

11796282,0,t1_dgx47iv,The drama is certainly a tearjerker but nonetheless the stories of each character are beautiful which makes me think it worth watching even if it makes me cry lol  I totally understand that you wouldnt want to continue due to all the sorrow though!,KDRAMA,dgx5d5a,2,t5_2rqv6
