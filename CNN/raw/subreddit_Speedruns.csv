6302421,1,t3_41wzw9,Andis what happened with your moderatorship at rspeedrun? Did you demod yourself after Alt came back? If Alt left would you go back? Or is that a bridge that youve burnt for good?Given the information Ive seen I do agree with you over Alts moderation and personal vendettas but as a somewhat outside observer to the drama I think the best thing you could do would be to stick with the rspeedrun mod team.But what do you think your bestcase scenario would be?,Speedruns,cz60ip5,0,t5_2torm
6335047,0,t1_cz9q0ig,Ended up lucky enough to find a copy at a local garage sale a year ago. I had been looking to get a copy at the time and suddenly I no longer needed to order a copy. It was the nut high.,Speedruns,cz9q4aq,2,t5_2torm

8261746,0,t3_4skflx,At least for me Quake II has been an amazing first game. The route only took me about a month to learn and three months later I have a time Im not embarrassed to post on speedruns.com. I started with this because as these others suggested its a game that I love. I grew up with this game and the whole Quake series so I already knew a lot about them. I just took that love and funneled it into countless hours of practice and now Im kind of okay at it! Good luck!,Speedruns,d5a9yi6,1,t5_2torm

Theres also this one guy RainingEndavor who was really inspirational to me. But i heard he quit speedrunning.,Speedruns,d85y1ja,2,t5_2torm
