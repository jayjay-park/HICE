75306,0,t3_1uylmn,I went to brooklyn as well.  to . Studied media and television.  I was also out of state when i first came here. I really enjoyed it alot. I reccomend finding an apartment around that area if you can to. They are cheaper then the dorms less rules on who can visit and shit and youll be walking distance from classes. Brooklyn college is a commuter school so what I experienced is that you really havw to put yourself out there to tall and make friends which waa really great for me I took all my core classes really early got them out of the way so my junior and senior year I was only worrying about major.  Whatever your major will be try to grt involved within that community. I learned more and had far better experiences working in the tv studio helping TA production classes and jooning clubs then I did in any of my classes. ,Brooklyn,cen03k7,1,t5_2qme3

Ive watched them come and go.  not so nice times? sure....never affected me much its  a neighborhood and the transplants or hipsters or gentrifiers have no idea what a neighborhood is.  For lack of a better world we have generational ethics.  The way I see it there are people that are from Brooklyn and people that live in Brooklyn.

1183944,0,t3_27503y,Love this post. I was born and raised in Brooklyn. Lived in Williamsburg until  moved to Bushwick and still here. I really dont know where I fall. I mean I hate how quickly things are changing. Its kind of ridiculous of how Williamsburg rapidly changed. Most of the places I used to go to are now gone. My Spanish restaurant is now a cafe. My bodega is now a Resturant. The bakery I used to go to is gone. All my friends and family are gone. I see why gentrification is happening. It makes sense. People cant afford to live in Manhattan? The next best option is live in a place near it. I get it. But I hate how people who move to certain neighborhoods and dont support their local stores. They rather go to trader joes or whole foods or buy clothes in th street or union square. I know Robertas is amazing but Try some Latin food. Try some Caribbean food. Go buy milk and a sandwich from your bodega. Go talk to your neighbors no matter what skin color. Im in odd position. Im Puerto Rican got my degree from Ithaca college. My girlfriend from Virginia. Shes white. She got a great job offer and she was excited to move to Brooklyn. She decided to live in BushwickRidgewood area. I recommended her to move there. But she goes to the bodega and gets milk and cereal from there. She goes to food bazar and not Trader joes. She goes to the local butcher shop to get her meat. She also goes to the local Latin restaurant near her apartment and she loves it. See my point here?Its a frustrating topic and I had way to many heated arguments about it with my girlfriends roommates. Once I see gentrification happening in Canarsie. Brownsville and East New York. Then Im moving out of here and moving upstate where most people who moved here came from. Sullivan county maybe? ,Brooklyn,ci2t9v9,2,t5_2qme3

1831275,0,t1_ck9o6qs,Well also people act like there arent cities there. Plenty of us have lived a city life in ohio. Just because you dont live in the most densely populated city in the nation doesnt make you some unadjusted fragile kid. The people that say go back to ohio need to get a clue. Cleveland is one of the largest metropolis in the nation. The city itself has a very Brooklyn feel to it the way it will range from hood to hip to wealthy in a rather small period of time. What needs to be understood is many people from this area fail to realize that there is life outside of NYC. Many New Yorkers have a deluded view on what a city is and if it doesnt compare in the scope of this one its unworthy and a laughable place to go. Get out see the world get your heads out of your asses and see what the rest of the country and world has to offer. Realize that NYC is a fairy tale place that it is massive and it is great that once you open your eyes and start seeing the world for what it really is there are other places in their own that can be equally as amazing as anything in NYC. Ill be damned if people sit here and say go back to ohio see for yourself live a little and take the time to know what something is before you group it into some BS comment about something you know nothing about.

Youre also probably thinking of the tram cars youd see in a small town where its one car at a time going in a loop but it doesnt have to be that way.Imagine how the end of the L train is setup last stop th ave.  A platform in the middle with a train waiting on each side.  You could have that setup and release cars from alternating sides every seconds giving each car a  min wait time.  Or you could have empty cars queued up and waiting releaseing them every seconds.As for your number crunching you have roughly  passengers on a standard  car train according to the mta.  So  cars is  rider capacity increase.  But rush hour trains are already pretty tightly run on the L.  Im not sure how many you can add before trains stopping between stations becomes an issue.  All you need is one asshole holding the doors open or trying to squeeze on a packed train to start delays.But there are two other factors to consider.. The tram will serve additional areas.  The brooklyn navy yard is an office park thats expanding quite a bit but is very underserved in public transportation.. Not only are new tunnels more expensive Id wager that its more expensive in salary as well.  Each train is  employees conductor and motorman withe the cheaper starting salary being k if I recall.  Adding your  trains for  shift is million in salary per year alone not including benefits and pension payments.  And  shift would only cover part of rush hour you need a bit more than  shift.I dont know what the tram service would require but  person per direction per side seems adequate.  So  people per shift for  shifts.  At  employees for the day its already significantly cheaper than the  train addition.Of course the best math to use would be cost per rider but we have too many assumptions on Tram capacity and  of employees needed.,Brooklyn,ckkccj9,1,t5_2qme3

2327658,0,t3_2lytf3,Are you looking for a place on your own or to have roommates? Roommate share situations are still somewhat affordable but if youre looking to get your own place prepare to spend an astronomical amount of money on rent. If you want your own place your options are basically live in deep south Brooklyn like south of Flatbush or in the hood like east of Crown Heights and East Flatbush Brownsville East New York Canarsie. Heres a map Affordable Brooklyn vs. Not Affordable Brooklyn red is not affordable blue is affordableIm aware that I included Bed Stuy in the not affordable section. There are still some small swathes of Bed Stuy that are not gentrified at all and are probably affordable but for the most part the Brooklyn real estate gold rush has already swallowed up Bed Stuy because speculators have deemed it the next place to blow up.My source for this Ive been looking to buy a place in Brooklyn for about a year. I finally gave up it was too expensive. I did find a place on the Upper East Side of MANHATTAN for less than anything I saw in the blue area of Brooklyn and Im in the process of closing on it now. And its not Yorkville like far away from the train its  blocks away from the th St.    station. Conclusion Brooklyn is no longer worth it.

Lowincome car owners already do pay for parking in the form of time spent waiting for ASP.Rich car owners can afford to pay for a garage or to pay for parking tickets.There are probably ways to price permits in a way that reflects income so its not clear that this should significantly affect car ownership patterns if you dont want to do that.The best part is that currently the time wasted on ASP regulations does very little for either the city or for the car owners.

A good bagel should be small very dense and have a crust on the outside that almost shatters when you bite into it.  It should also be a relatively salty bread but thats my own preference.  Really a proper bagel is all about size and texture.  The big fluffy Oshaped dinner rolls that get passed off as bagels in less discerning quarters are a blight and a shame.  ,Brooklyn,cuqz3ic,1,t5_2qme3

Mind you that a conventional will carry a PMI until you hit  LTV loan to value or if you have an FHA the PMI is for the life of the loan at  LTV you can refinance into a lower rate if available and a conventional mortgage. For instance we bought a townhouse in Staten Island. Mortgage is a bit more than rent but its mine and since I only put down . on an FHA I had enough to basically renovate the place.

7328638,0,t3_4fnwwt,I am a cyclist and live off th Ave. I try my best to avoid riding down it at all costs and reading this certainly seals the deal. There are always large trucks taking up space on the narrow road as well as cars speeding through to avoid the terribly timed lights. Even when I drive on it Im uneasy. The city needs to take the truck routes seriously and start enforcing the rules to keep people safe. So sorry for the victim his loved ones and all of the people who had to witness this horrible crash. And please fellow cyclists avoid th Avenue until the authorities ticket vehicles that dont belong and enforce the speed limit! ,Brooklyn,d2b7srg,2,t5_2qme3
7547619,0,t1_d2zs2ce,Theres a lot more to it than that. We do the leg work for the landlords who in most instances own several buildings with  apartments in each. We ended having around  apartments to rent at any given time. We have to go to these places take photos make copies and keep track of the keys for each apartment which we get charged  for if we lose btw create the ads set up appointments  I received upwards of  calls texts and emails a day show the apartments find alternatives if the client doesnt like the initial apt run credit checks fill out all guarantor and lease agreements have them notorized deliver everything to the owner and address any concerns the client may have with their new apartment. All of this resulted in renting  apts a week netting me around . There are no days off and you are always on call. If a client calls at pm and wants to see an apartment at pm I get on a train or in a cab and go show it. Its  commission. Dont rent anything dont get paid. All travel expenses come out of my pocket. But youre right. The renter does all of the work by clicking on a couple CL links and making a phone call or two. Were vampires that dont deserve to make a living. EDIT Forgot to mention that theres usually  rental agencies working to rent the same apartments. About  of the time by the time Ive copied the keys photographed the apartment and posted the ad the apartment is already rented. ,Brooklyn,d304m1h,2,t5_2qme3

7629766,0,t3_4jsbk6,You should be fine getting landlords to rent to you just make sure that you can prove youre getting that income. Bring copies of checks bank statements deposit receipts etc. Generally they want your annual income to be x the monthly rent. That makes them confident that youll be able to pay and they wont have to go through the hassle of evicting you. So if your annual combined income is k then you should look for places that cost  or less per month which is doable.I agree with others in this thread who suggested Bay Ridge or other areas in south Brooklyn. Pay attention to crime rates when youre picking a neighborhood though.Hope everything goes well for you guys cheers!,Brooklyn,d39gows,2,t5_2qme3
7635981,0,t1_d39vzv1,But this proposal isnt being presented as being contingent on a series of improvements that can improve service for everyone. Its a pretty direct reshuffling of current service to give a benefit to some customers at the expense of many more. The report itself states this and does not contemplate the measures youve brought up. Youre talking about the  Capital plan  thats at least  years away meaning maybe we get some of those improvements in  years. Thats a ton of reduced service before an improvement is seen. WhyIt doesnt strike me as a foot in the door proposal. It seems more like a divide and conquer. Now passengers and electeds along the line are fighting each other instead of the MTA. Lastly the loads in the report seem wrong. The average F train at Bergen is not  full. Its much more than that. Whats the median or mode loading?  Compare the reports of  loading on page  and proposed loading on page .
