Especially on the ticket.The case could be made that the whole point of talk radio punditry is to build up the credibility of the host in the mind of the viewer in order to lend that credibility to the advertiser.  It might be effective but it bothers me when someone like Dave Ramsey who supposedly has his listeners best interests at heart cashes in on that credibility to hawk wares for the advertiser.But the Ticket model is awesome.  Instead of credibility the hosts are trading on their comedy chops.  You listen to the live spots because of the potential for spontaneous shenanigans and the resulting entertainment.

4560052,0,t1_ct4obby,The Hardline and The Musers have really been driving me crazy with their music talk lately. Outside of Biggest Show Coming to Town if they talk music its an immediate punch out for me.  Its almost guaranteed to be about U the Foo Fighters Neil Young the Rolling Stones or some other nostalgia dad rock act. These bands are all fine but they talk about them CONSTANTLY like theyre the only bands in the world that are doing anything worth mentioning.I give props to Gordon and BaD Radio because they have musical tastes that are a little broader.  In particular the bumper music that BaD plays constantly surprises me with how good and modern the stuff theyre playing is. Im guessing this is partly due to the fact that BaD surrounds themselves with younger people who are a little more plugged in to the modern music scene.I would absolutely love hearing Rhyner review music from newer acts.

Obviously  The Ticket is the shining star in their portfolio of stations and even stations like . The Wolf draw great ratings amp ad rates but if the parent company goes bellyup is there risk that The Ticket folds?  Clearly someone else would buy up this asset  But curious if during the transition they could go off the air for awhile  AND  that with new management certain personnel changes could be made.  That is my main fear.   Cumulus operates s of stations with dozens of corporate office leasesequipment.  In the event of bankruptcy they very well could begin a fire sale on these assets and exit their leases leaving The Ticket at a crossroads.  Really hope it doesnt come to that.

They make fun of themselves all the time about their testimonial ads. Ill give you an example of why I dont think its paid. The other day Corby did two segments in a row about the newly announced YouTube TV streaming service. Corby was pumped about it and plans to switch. Danny amp Rhynes were more dubious. I thought about that a little later on that night. Isnt ATampT a big sponsor of The Ticket? That YouTube TV is going to compete directly with ATampT. So that goes to my point about how they dont really do paid ads in the show itself. Just my two cents worth. No HSO or anything. ,theticket,degz0z5,1,t5_2upu8
