Personally Ive read the OT III data in LRHs own hand and have had its contents confirmed by people that have done the related auditing.

1734499,0,t1_cjxppc7,Idle Org or Idle Morgue as some say is a reference to the push to make all Scientology Orgs physical locations of churches into what they call Ideal Orgs which are nice and fancy and big usually in a historical building.  The official line is that they now can offer a full range of services or some such.  The unofficial story is that Tom Cruise wanted to send a friend to get Scientology services and they said the org wasnt nice enough to send friends into.So when they put out press releases saying theyve opened up however many new orgs it usually means that the org in that city has closed and a new Ideal Org opened up not that it was an actual new church opened up.  Its quite the scheme  the local org has to fundraise to buy the building then fundraise to get plans and hire developers then fundraise to do the work then fundraise to open.  Then some people go out and do hardsell fundraising or concentrate on getting a lot from one person or group and those people get  commission on the donations they bring in.At the end of this multyear push the local org has to turn over title to the building to the Mother Church they dont even own it! then pay them rent to the Mother Church in addition to paying the bills and stuff.  Its generally seen as a huge scheme for Scientology Inc. to become a great rich landowner on the backs of the members. Theyre generally mocked because most people who have been in them find them absolutely beautiful but generally empty.  It was supposed to boom the orgs  make them busting centers and increase membership  but outside observers feel that the intense fundraising pushes among other things have actually decimated membership numbers.gtthe owners forced to repurchase the books to drive up statsYup thats pretty much it.  There are numerous series of books that have been rereleased sometimes more than once.  The members have to purchase new ones creating more profit for BridgeMother church.

2002599,0,t1_ckudi7q,Part of the problem is that everything is central in the database and its not at the same time. Meaning the different churches can all have a listing and then send several mailings. Sometimes there can be spelling errors also that cause multiple listings. Honestly this happens all the time with the catering company I work for! The best thing to do is systemically call each church that she gets mail from and politely ask that they remove her from the list. Be patient and five them all of the information and the correct spelling. This is from my experience with mailing lists for work not just from the church. I just know that mailing lists easily get messed up and can be crazy to maintain. But promotional pieces are also expensive so appeal to them and say something like shes not reading these and wont be reading them so save some money and trees!

2824283,0,t3_2sbsrh,I have attempted to explain in some detail what my specific objections to Scientology are and so have several other critics on this site.  None of us particularly want to be associated with Nazi book burners and none of us would have any intention of confiscating and burning Scientology books.  There are lots of things that need to be done to protect the public from Scientology and to penalize the crimes that the cult has committed.  Legal proceedings are required.  The property of the cult should be confiscated and leading cultists particularly David Miscavige deserve prison sentences.  No book burning is needed.  If we wind up with piles of books that were in the warehouses and bookstores of the cult those can be recycled for their paper content.  Books in private hands should not be confiscated.  Even critics of Scientology have some use for Scientology books so that they can make more specific criticisms although of course at the present time you cant really quote from the books without the risk of a copyright infringement lawsuit from the cult.  ,scientology,cnp45i0,1,t5_2qh3a

2933858,0,t1_co1ipc9,gt Okay thats a fair answer.gt Im not taking the time to watch the video right now since Im supposed to be working.Ya... me too... lol gt How do you test such things?Well you could say take  different groups of people from all walks of life and sit them down with  different auditors  using an e meter and  faking it which would provide the control but it would have to be a blind study where each PC would not know which was which all trained by in the same situation same course room or sup or whatever to rule out fault with the learning and not with the tech. Then all  auditors run the people through the same set of questions designed ONLY to produce reads on the e meter. This would not be therapy but rather similar to the e meter drills. Running all  people through similar situations might produce different reads for each PC expected but should in theory produce precisely the same read on all  auditors using an e meter. You could test whether the auditor is influencing the read or not.You could also make it a double blind by having the auditing session done in person but both auditor and PC are holding the cans and a switch can be flipped to allow which person is actually being read by the meter. In theory there should be no difference either way and if the observer can switch it back and forth without either PC or Auditor noticing a change then that would be a pass.The key is to develop a method which tests the claims of how an e meter works without allowing it to be dismissed due to outside influence. It would be tricky and you might have to test it in different stages to test different claims. I think a key point from my point of view is that what you are doing IS a valid form of therapy I only think the meter is uterly unnecessary to the validity of the therapy since it is basically just a form of talk it out. So I dont discount your auditing results just that the methods you went about doing them are not then proven to be  true because you got some results. The only thing you can really test empirically is whether or not the meter functions as is claimed by Hubbard and in addition if the first is even true which I am highly skeptical about whether or not it would be possible to get identical reads on both auditor and PC whether in person over skype or even via a phone call. ,scientology,co1lba6,1,t5_2qh3a

3362016,0,t1_cpbf4bh,gt The cult is very busy creating its own enemies and there are now quite a lot of usI am legion for we are many Its interesting you mentioned abuses increasing with time. I thought about that phenomena for a sec and have a hypothesis about why that is. My premise is basically that in a cult like setting which mirrors narcissistic traits and often has paranoid traits as well at least Scientology certainly does you have a leader or group of leaders who commit crimesabuses due to their orders not being followed or anything which causes a wrench in their plans. Over time these abuses cause more problems within the organization lack of motivation exhausted workforce malnutrition etc which in turn leads to further situations in which the goals and plans of the leader is not successfully met. Because the organization is abusive narcissistic and paranoid the leader is unable to accept that bad things sometimes just happen. Every bad thing is viewed as an attack or a threat and must be destroyed before it causes more problems. Due to its narcissistic side the church as a whole is completely unable to accept that IT might be causing the problems from the start. So the leader must further lash out to stop the perceived threats which is simply more abuse and thus starts the cycle all over again.So the logical assumption might be that if an organization has abusive leaders early on the workforce would revolt or leave and natural selection would destroy that organization or that the leadership would be replaced by people who are less abusive and over time the abuses would decrease or at the LEAST the abuses would be exposed as they were and the leadership would straighten up to avoid further PR issues. However due to the organizations tendencies toward the various psychological issues the leadership seems to be unable to admit that they are even commiting abuses and instead projects their failure onto their subordinates and blames them which leads them to commit MORE abuses trying to prevent those situations which they perceive caused the problem to begin with.,scientology,cpbhtq8,3,t5_2qh3a
3504828,0,t1_cprqgl2,I do not doubt that LRH performed what he considered to be research and that he did try to make Scientology work.  He also felt free at any time to make any claims he wanted to with or without any basis in research.  I heard a lecture from the Saint Hill Special Briefing Course in which LRH informs us that stars do not ever burn out they shine forever and the stars which astronomers think have burned out are actually stars that have not ignited yet.  How is it that stars never run out of hydrogen fuel?  LRH does not say.  Obviously LRH did not perform any astronomical research to discover this amazing information.  Perhaps this is simply something that he knew or thinks that he knew in a former lifetime or something that he knew by means of his Theta Knowingness or just some bullshit that he made up to impress his credulous students at Saint Hill.  It has nothing to do with auditing technique but then very little in his endlessly verbose and meandering lectures had anything to do with auditing technique.In a sense everything that happened in Scientology was part of LRHs research every single person being audited by any Scientologist anywhere provided data that was available to LRH.  We were all his research subjects.  I do not doubt that he studied folders talked to auditors sent voluminous telexes and so forth.  But in the end there was no scientific discipline.  LRH did whatever he felt like doing and his work could not be reviewed duplicated or tested by anybody.  You would never really know exactly how he came to any conclusion about anything but you are obligated to accept his conclusions because he is the founder a position of infinite authority according to him.  That is not how scientific research works.  Still LRH was very clever.  Scientology creates what is at least an illusion of a meticulously worked out technology.

3561822,0,t1_cpy9cpo,gt But it is not really racism even though it sounds like racismThis I agree with... I debated including a statement about why this really made me laugh but I figured most people here wouldnt know comic books like I do so I refrained. However I will humor you so as to explain why this may not be racist but it is certainly speciesist. In the XMen storylines Magneto leads a group of Mutants which he calls the Brotherhood of Mutants. They believe that the Mutants who have superpowers above that of normal humans are a new species called homo superior. They also act in very Nazi like fashion believing themselves to be the superior race and thus deserving of a place of royalty or leadership over the homo sapiens they look down on... so I am certain you can see the similarities. Hubbard claims that his new species has superpowers per any normal definition of the word though they may not consider them superpowers persay and he looks down on homo sapiens and he claims that his new species should be naturally elevated to leadership over homo sapiens.I agree it is not racist though in a way its worse. I think it still applies to say master race since he does believe in a master race its just not an ethnic race but rather a entire species human race for instance. Though I agree that to many people the term race may be misleading so if anyone is reading this please be aware that I was not using race to mean ethnicity but rather to refer to species of which the only seperation in this case is ENTIRELY in Hubbards delusional claims. There is no different species of humanoid with special powers and thus there is no race there to be elevated above humanity.

3623703,0,t1_cq4l6s9,gt My point is not that the baby of the two lesbian mothers actually was going to become unable to obtain medical care because of a single bigoted pediatrician who refused to treat herShe couldnt just walk like a few doors down and see another pediatrician? Or if she was at a private doctors office she couldnt have googled to find another within like  miles? I dont know if her location made a big difference or something but where I am I could probably fine  different private practices within like  miles of my house without any difficulty so one turning me away wouldnt be a big deal. In fact we have had to deal with that due to not having the right insurance company and thus having to switch doctors. That actually happened to us twice right in the middle of a series of treatments that the next doctor wouldnt do so I have little sympathy for having to change doctors cause they refused treatment to someone its happened to us and we just moved to a new doctor. Now if the person is the ONLY doctor within  miles then thats a whole different story but in THAT situation that persons hippocratic oath should be taking over and they SHOULD be willing to treat the person despite differences but if the person is the only doctor within  miles and they are  private practice then why has no other doctor moved there? I cannot think of a single realistic situation where this would end in the child dying.gt So why would we oppose racial segregation but allow segregation based on sexual preference?I oppose both but neither should be illegal for private businesses. I am saying it should not be illegal but I never said that everyone should do it. I support a persons RIGHT to be an asshole just like I support everyone elses RIGHT to hate that person. I support Pizzahuts RIGHT to turn down customers cause they are white or cause they are gay or whatever other reasons but if they were to do that I would also support the RIGHT of everyone to not every buy another pizza from them to send the message that thats not ok. It should not be illegal but it should be culturally punished so severely that nobody would even think to do it. gt It is simply wrong to discriminate against minority groupsAgreed. But I also think its wrong to teach your kids about Jesus without teaching them that there are PLENTY of other religions to include no religion that they could choose to follow. But I am not about to try and make that illegal. Just cause something is wrong doesnt mean it should be illegal. gt It is never a single business. It is a large scale organized and comprehensive exclusion of some minority group from society in general.I have faith that there are MORE good people than bad in enough numbers that those businesses that exclude will be shown to suffer for it. They will lose business and in the end the general attitude of everyone will shift further toward the dont discriminate idea. But I still see no reason why each business should not be legally allowed to serve who they want. If the service is not governmentally funded I can promise there is a competitor somewhere who would be perfectly happy to have your business.As I said we could even tax them for it. Increase taxes on businesses but add a tax refund each year for nondiscrimination which can only be gained if there have been no discrimination reports against that business or we could charge a fee once a month to maintain a we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone sign which allows them to do so. And if you dont pay that fee you are required to post a different sign which says This business may not refuse service due to race creed color sexual orientation or gender. That way the business who wants to discriminate will have to pay more AND lose business. Good luck staying afloat in a competitive market with that against you.gt I am not going to accept that stores can pick and choose what kind of people they want as customers suppliers or employees other than that they should be qualified in the sense that customers pay suppliers supply and employees perform their jobs well.Why not? Would you prefer they just close down? Then NOBODY gets their business rather than only the people they wanted to serve. This is much like the locally grown thing. I know people who think it should be illegal to ship food in from further away when there are crops nearby which could be sold. Which then begs the question why is the far away stuff cheaper....? Why should the grocery store be forced to buy from that guy rather than some other guy simply cause they are closer? I see no difference between the attitude that a grovery store owner can choose to receive their product from anyone they want for any reason and the attitude that a grovery store owner can sell to anyone for any reason. or vice versa. gt We will either get along with each other or we will be at each others throats. We can be friends or we can be enemies. Friendship would work better.Which is still not an argument for making it illegal only for rallying behind those who boycott businesses that discriminate. Making it illegal sends the message that business owners do not control their business the government does. Making it legal to serve whoever you want sends the message that the business owner is in fact the one who is free to make their own decisions. And when they turn someone down for being gay and suddenly  of the city refuses to shop at their store they suffer for it. I simply do not believe in governmental regulation of businesses in any way. I believe in the societal regulation of businesses. I believe in cultural regulation of businesses. But I do not believe that the government should be able to tell any private citizen who they want to associate with. And I consider that a business is just a service being offered by a person so that person should have the same rights to associate sell to whoever they want to or do not want to. If mankind is at the point where the only way we can stop a culture wide discrimination against a certain type of people is to regulate it with laws then we are doomed. I have to believe that given a legal pass to murder that a person would still not do it simply because its wrong. That if it is not illegal to steal that the majority of people would still not steal. I know there would be SOME people who would do it but I also have to believe that those people would be ostracized from society and that even without laws there would be punishments for doing the wrong thing.Perhaps I am simply too optimistic and too trusting of human kind. I simply cant accept that the only thing preventing us from falling over the edge into a society where everyone discriminates against certain groups is anti discrimination laws. I have to believe that the REAL reason we arent like that as a society is because people are basically decent and not as Lord of the Flies would have us believe savages barely held together by the laws of society.,scientology,cq5bumd,2,t5_2qh3a

3638541,0,t1_cq6zltt,Ya... I think a statement like that is a bit narcissitic. Its a bit of a well sure they are spreading information but its only people like ME who really make a difference. Considering it was Reddit and the discussions on this very sub that convinced me to leave the cult and it was this sub which provided me all of my information when I was still too unsure of myself to just straight up google and find the overwhelming amount of information I can say that people posting online under pseudonyms had a pretty massive effect in Seattle. Enough to draw their PPO away from post and enough to make them lose one of their most valuable assets. I dont say that to say I was valuable as a staff member only that their number of HCO quald staff was tiny. I think we had  on Day Org Staff... so when I left Reddit quite literally was the main reason the Seattle Org lost  of its HCO qualified staff. Thats a pretty decent impact for saying it has no effect and that is just in one case multiply that by however many others have left because of online posts by people hiding behind pseudonyms and you have a pretty large effect.I agree Marty Tony Mark and company are fighting the good fight and I respect them for speaking out but sometimes its the quiet voice talking about a shared experience of struggle and unhappiness not the loud shouting about abuses and crimes that cause someone to first start to question and seriously look at their situation.,scientology,cq70rm0,9,t5_2qh3a

3645485,0,t3_32467o,This is a resource for learning about Scientology and you could obtain some information from it however it is biased in favor of Scientology and not reliable.  I checked into the history of LRHs record in WW II.  It has been established by several researchers such as Russell Miller in his book Barefaced Messiah that nothing that LRH claimed about his war record is supported by the records of the US navy in which he served.  However in this site we are told that there are gaps in the official record which they interpret to mean that if there is some period of time that the naval records do not mention then that must be when LRH did and experienced everything he claimed.  We get bizarre conclusions such as we dont actually know if LRH was awarded a Purple Heart.  Well we could tell.  If it had happened there would be a record of it.  It is absurd to imagine that LRH emerged from the war blinded and crippled as he claims while his official record shows he was in excellent health except for a minor eye infection conjunctivitis.  That is not the kind of thing you accidentally leave out of an official record.  So this reference source is designed to rationalize or paper over all the problems which we find with Scientology.  Even so you can listen to LRH lectures and get some first hand information about what he actually said if you really want to research the subject. ,scientology,cq7t99u,5,t5_2qh3a

State that you will be keeping track of their actions at your closest org and that you will be sending weekly emails to here just insert every name you can think of every public critic you know about to report the actions of the church.TBH its kind of hard to get declared if you have never been a member and dont know any members and are not an outspoken public critic. They declare people to force them to disconnect from current members. Its their strategy to ensure that A nobody talks to you or hears from you getting any critical information about the church and B that you are never allowed in any org to do any services to them a punishment worse than death. You could also try and find an email list of a bunch of local Scientologists are send them everything you can find online about the Church. The more connected you become to active members the more likely the local HCO will feel threatened by you and the more likely they will be to declare you. Whether or not you will actually be informed if you are declared or not is anyones guess.

3867528,0,t3_34qmce,We did recently  days ago have a detailed discussion of this policy letter but without actually quoting it at length.  The funny thing is extreme as this policy letter is it is exactly the kind of thing that you would say if you actually had a working technology that does the things that Scientology promises to do.  If you did have the power to resolve all human aberration and make people superhumanly sane and capable allowing people to achieve advanced spiritual abilities as immortal beings that really would be important enough to justify the kind of urgency expressed in this policy letter.  However since we do not see those promised results this policy letter is just part of the deception.  LRH is invoking the highest level of urgency on behalf of his sleazy con game.  He wanted us all to win or die in the attempt but he was the only person who won.  Everyone else made extraordinary sacrifices on his behalf purely for his glorification and enrichment. A statement such as wed rather have you dead than incapable makes you think that those are the two options.  But the Church of Scientology did not make people more capable of anything other than selfdeception.  The cult has never been about making people more capable.  It did however make a number of people dead.  That much it did accomplish.  And so far it has escaped the legal consequences of its crimes.,scientology,cqx4rau,3,t5_2qh3a

3906867,0,t1_cr1l020,Its a rarely known fact. When I first got involved all the stuff I saw against the church was REALLY over the top stuff like the AngryGayPope made me think all critics were like that rather than realizing most critics are more like this sub.... so I stopped looking for info online and just asked the people I had known for a year or two from the church. They then showed me books and things about Hubbards past. Since I had no reason to not believe them no information to know what was being left out thus no reason to realize it wasnt a complete story I didnt even know there was another wife other than Mary Sue and I knew she was arrested for her GO involvement which of course was spun to look like she was off doing that without permission from Hubbard... I had no clue that Jamie DeWolf was L Ron Hubbard Jr so when I heard the name I thought it was just another critic and that was that. Quentin Hubbard was not a name I had heard once till I left. In other words what family? or you mean Mary Sue? She was totally suppressive its a good thing Hubbard got away from her. Keep in mind that for many Scientologists they have NO information other than what the Church tells them and by the time I even realized anything was wrong I was already deeply indoctrinated unknowingly to not ever accept info from any source outside of the Church. There should be quite a few red flags and for the majority of people those red flags do turn them away. But in some rare situations the individual just happens to have a perfect set of circumstances that allows them to become deeply indoctrinated before they realize anything is wrong.,scientology,cr1m8g3,3,t5_2qh3a

4120303,0,t1_crpw8xq,There is actually yet another reason to criticize Scientology that you have not included on your list which is that there is actually something wrong with Scientology and it therefore merits criticism.  And thats why I do it.You have explained to me all the reasons why you continue to sell DMSMH but none of those reasons alters the fact that there are lies in that book and furthermore there are lies which are known to be lies and have been proved to be lies and which could at any time have been corrected had LRH wanted to correct them.  For some strange reason LRH preferred to continue to lie.  In any event this is still the answer to your question of why people were critical of LRH even as early as .  Thats when he started lying to people.  Some people noticed this.My belief that my life has only a limited duration and that when I die I will cease to exist has no effect on the way I experience life.  For example I enjoy eating food.  The taste of the food is not in any way diminished by my expectation of eventually dying and ceasing to exist.  Furthermore everything that we do in life has a limited duration that is quite normal.  When I watch a movie for example I know that the movie only lasts a certain length of time something in the range of two hours normally and then it ends.  This does not spoil my enjoyment of the movie.  I do not need a movie of infinite length even if such a thing were possible.  I actually think of life as being very much like a ride in an amusement park.  I know that the ride will come to an end.  They dont even last as long as movies do usually.  It might be a  minute ride.  I enjoy it anyway.  My knowledge that the ride will come to an end does not in any way prevent me from enjoying the ride.  And much the same is true of everything that I do.  I would neither read nor compose comments on reddit if they had to be of infinite length.  My meals do not involve an infinite amount of food.  I read books which do not have an infinite number of pages.  Sometimes I wish that certain things would last longer than they do but I never wish that they would last forever.  That would be impractical.  If my amusement park ride lasted forever that means I would in due course die of dehydration on the ride and that would not be amusing at all.Even though I will eventually die and cease to exist that does not mean that my actions in this lifetime will have no consequences that last beyond the time of my death.  In theory comments or articles that I post on this site could continue to be read after my death.  Or maybe they wont be but even so if someone has learned something by reading my comments and articles then the actions of that person could be influenced by what I have said.  They may quote me to other people.  Perhaps they will become more opposed to Scientology than they previously were.  Several people have actually told me that they found my comments to be helpful and enlightening.  Of course my life does not consist only of criticizing Scientology which would be a rather narrow basis for a life.  I know that I have done many things in the course of my life which have affected other people to a significant degree.  I could describe these actions to you but you dont really need that level of detail.  Suffice to say I have changed the lives of some people and then everything that those people do is to some degree the result of my efforts.  And those people in turn affect other people.  There is an ever expanding sequence of consequences to my actions because consequences also have consequences.  I have not had a huge influence on the world but I have had some influence and that influence will continue in various complicated and indirect ways for the indefinite future.  But then perhaps it all comes to an end sometime.  The human race can become extinct at some point and chances are realistically that it will sooner or later.  And when the last human being dies assuming that the human race has not influenced some other intelligent species which will continue to live when humans are extinct  maybe even intelligent robots then all the consequences of my own actions will come to an end.In a certain sense I regret that my actions will not have an infinite series of consequences that will extend through time forever never coming to an end.  But reality has no obligation to conform to my wishes.  For that matter I would rather be an immortal being than a mortal biological organism.  It would be nice for me to be able to believe that even when my body dies I continue to live.  I would like that.  But just because I would like it does not make it true.  The universe does not really care what I would like.  I find it more practical to accept the real world as it is than to insist on believing things that are not real.  Anyway you want to know why I continue to live.  My life is what I have.  If I were not alive I could not do or experience anything.  Since I am still capable of doing useful things and experiencing enjoyable experiences I want to do that.  It seems pretty logical to me.Of course it is true as you say that once I am dead my own subjective experience will be the same as if I had never existed.  There is nothing I can about that.  However as I have mentioned even if when I am dead I personally have no perception that I ever existed some people have been affected by me and my actions in my lifetime and the world to some tiny degree is different because I have lived in it.  Perhaps that is not good enough but nonetheless that is the way it is whether I approve or not.  My life may only have a small amount of value and I may have only a small influence on other people but that is no reason not to make use of my life to enjoy living and to help others.Your final question is with eternal death staring us in the face is criticizing Scientology on the internet really the best use of my time.  I think it is a pretty good use of my time.  And it is my time to use as I wish.  I would rather be inventing a revolutionary and extremely valuable new technology that will make me fabulously wealthy and will also improve the condition of the entire human race however I do not seem to be capable of doing that.  So I do what I can.  And I do not spend all of my time criticizing Scientology on the internet although it might seem that way to some observers.  As I have mentioned I do eat food watch movies read books and even sometimes go to an amusement park and go on the rides not all the rides some of them are too frightening.

These groups were highly reliant on the work of a few individuals who would for a hefty fee act as expert witnesses in trials and formed the basis for deprogramming and referral schemes.Its a very thorny area brainwashing  with a lot of money thrown around by interested parties including Scientology.

From the Scientology perspective it is about how we came to be here on Earth as exiles from other planets in our galaxy but there is an enormous amount of time that elapses and many events which occur from the time when the universe was created to Incident .

4608536,0,t3_3e3biw,Just consider how this article begins  The historic momentum just keeps on building for the Church of Scientology whose unprecedented growth and epic escalation continued its ambitious movement forward with the grand opening July  of the new Ideal Continental Liaison Office...  The first sentence tells us in four different ways how Scientology is expanding  historic momentum unprecedented growth epic escalation ambitious movement forward.  All in one sentence.  This is an absurd degree of emphasis particularly considering that the opening of a new office is not the same thing as the recruitment of new membership.  So far the only thing that Miscavige has proved with all his new buildings is that the cult has a lot of money which they can afford to spend on real estate.  The fundamental problems of the cult do not include a lack of real estate.  The cult remains a pseudoscientific totalitarian paranoid and deeply dysfunctional organization which now has a lot of real estate in which to carry on their ridiculous activities.,scientology,ctbhmpl,2,t5_2qh3a

So that is the final dishonesty of this supposed drug rehabilitation facility.  One of my biggest complaints about the Church of Scientology and its front groups such as Narconon is that they cannot even manage to do Scientology correctly.

5102759,0,t1_cv0w60c,By the time I left you had to sign some gnarly five page contract to actually take courses  but its possible that the intro courses were exempt from this I dont remember now and its been quite a few years so things may have changed.  The contract technically made you a scientologist  it said stuff like you waive all future psychiatric help and will let the church take care of you if you go nuts that scientology courses and counseling make no promises of results etc. etc.  But its just a piece of paper nobody in their right mind is going to start pressuring raw public beyond their comfort level thats an ARC break!  Not that it never happens  some people are definitely not in their right minds they are caught between idealism indoctrination and pressure to bring up their numbers.  But generally the atmosphere at this point will be more or less casual.If you want to go take an introductory course they will give you the course without much issue the intro courses are cheap and can be worthwhile from a personal perspective.  Seriously theres some good albeit basic stuff in the introductory courses  there must be something that keeps otherwise intelligent and goodwilled people coming back for more after all.  In the process of taking the course you will record any personal thoughts and realizations and share these with the course instructor.  At some point you will be routed to the registrar or some other person who will try to sign you up for the next thing.  Maybe that will be another introductory course maybe an auditing package maybe the purification rundown  all depends on your level of interest and how much money they think you have or can acquire.The goal is to keep you going with something no matter how small.  If you leave after an intro course people will likely try to dissuade you and you will get periodic phone calls but you can still sneak away at this point without much trouble.  At some point you will be pushed to buy a Clear package  a large auditing package that runs or used to run around K  or a training package which is basically the same thing only you do coauditing and learn to audit along the way and its cheaper.  At some point you will be pressured to join staff in some capacity.  If you start one of these and try to leave you have a large financial or contractual investment and its going to be much stickier.  If youre on board for these the Sea Org folks come around periodically and try to recruit you too.,scientology,cv12m59,3,t5_2qh3a

I am interested to see which of the three potential outcomes happen Ross and Carrie leave the organization and cease all involvement with Scientology altogether. They leave the organization but continue to practice some aspects of Scientology outside of the organization They stay in the organization and report on the podcast that Scientology is actually a wonderful technology that they now believe in.I find  extremely unlikely and I believe the result will be  but I also think they will report that there were some aspects which had some positive effects. This tells me that the majority of the problem is in organizational structure. Regardless of my personal belief or lack thereof in Scientology itself I think it would be wildly more successful if Miscavige and the Sea Org were entirely done away with all stat pushing was ended the prices were drastically reduced and more individual freedom was given to auditors to work their own way.

7490919,0,t3_4hw8jw,You know people amaze me.My GF believes sincerely her ex never watches porn because he says so. Her rationale is that he didnt have his own smart phone and his only computer is a work laptop and theyd fire him. He also wasnt doing it when he used her phone and the fact he followed porn stars on Twitter was because they post nudes.One reason he is an ex is that he had been sexting a woman they both know. He defended it by saying that it was just to mock her and he had even taken his work laptop and put it in the breakroom. He says that it would stay there so all the guys on the night shift could for weeks pretend to be him and sext her as part of a huge and frankly degrading prank.Now obviously the second even shows that the idea that porn viewing would have gotten him fired if its true. I mean that story alone is suspect since it seems highly unlikely anyone could do that without getting in trouble. But if you believe that its a bit hard to accept they monitor things closely enough to catch porn and that they must not be too concerned about a hostile workplace since his claims clearly mean that is a very hostile workplace for women if theyre true.My point is that we look at a Church that has set up all of these shell corporations and a structure specifically to protect itself from legal action while at the same time having such tight control by the people in the companies you as a member have no legal affiliation with. To us it immediately screams scam.

7680575,0,t3_4kgepr,A few of my own takeaways from this A science that is uncritical of itself is among the best descriptions. This was  and most of the people they interviewed were starryeyed young people who could not imagine changing their minds. I think thats a function of being  We all feel immortal and cannot fathom criticizing someone or something we care about. Certainly when I was  I was sure that I would always be married to my first husband and always stay in the CofS etc. That attitude is not peculiar to the CofS or cults or anything else its something that the warmongers have always counted on because I am on the side of the right! certainty  and that sense of immortality makes those young people willing to march off to war.A long time ago a friend interviewed Tom Lehrer and she asked him why he stopped writing satire. He told her that he was no longer young enough to do so that only the young see only one side of an issue. He had developed too much compassion for the other viewpoint to attack it with such acerbic wit. As a friend opined I saw harbingers of the future we are living now. Every single criticism offered in that video reflects something we still see today. If nothing else it points out that all the problems both actual ones and PR problems in terms of communicating what we aimed to do were there all along. And we never made a bit of headway in solving them. One longheld attitude in the CofS about communicating what this is is that you ought to draw others into your perception of reality rather than understanding and speaking to the viewpoint of the person questioning you. Towards the end where the young man is obviously asked how he feels about Hubbard making so much money the guy gets all fanboy about it Gosh hes done so much for the world and works so hard it doesnt matter to me that he gets rich. It would have been so much more effective to be sensible to turn to the interviewer and say Look innovation is hard work and when it succeeds its okay for it to bring great rewards. If you saw someone create a cancer cure would you expect the patient to criticize how much that doctor earned from the operation? When you feel your life is changed or given back to you... well of course I support Hubbard. To my view he has created something wonderful and its fine with me if he earns financial rewards. ,scientology,d3f8h38,2,t5_2qh3a

Its important to know the axioms of any belief system to know what the entire thing is based on. Its like examining the foundation of a house to ensure it is built on something solid and functional.An axiom is a statement or proposition that is regarded as being established accepted or selfevidently trueAxiom  in Scientology isgt   Life is basically a static. That is not an axiom. Life is not static nor is life a static. Life changes constantly. Life comes and goes. It starts and stops. A plant germinates grows eventually dies and is gone. That life is no longer in existence and as such life cannot be a static.gt Energy consists of postulated particles in space. No this assumes a being capable of postulating. That is an assumption which makes this axiom not established self evident or accepted. Current human knowledge does not accept and has not established that energy is postulated particles in space. Energy can be thermal electrical mechanical chemical radiant or kinetic. Some of these are not made of particles in space in fact many of these are waves not particles.If we extend this into the Factors which I would consider to be of a similar importance to the basic axioms of Scientology using the generic definition not the Scientology definition. gt Before the beginning was a Cause and the entire purpose of the Cause was the creation of effect. This is a nonsense statement. Before the beginning cannot exist. There is no before the start of the concept of time. Thats simply a semantically impossible concept. However it gets worse. The entire purpose of the cause was the creation of effect implies a purpose to the universe. Ther eis no accepted demonstrated or self evident purpose to the universe. The only self evident fact is that the universe exists. WHY the universe exists cannot be self evident and it is CERTAINLY not widely accepted.This is why I feel the axioms are flawed. But it would require a LOT more discussion to actually get anywhere in any sort of discussion about the topic.gt On the basis of direct observation of your own applicationsAgain yes by my own direct observation. Some of my practice of Scientology was useful some was entirely worthless and some was even harmful to me as an over all individual. I consider it to be a waste of time because I personally have found that all the benefits I found could have very easily been found in other practices meditation basic communication seminars military training etc. And as I said the worst case that I have observed is that it can actually be harmful. This is simply my observation of Scientology. It may not be yours and that is fine. This is just the reason that I do not find the study of Scientology as a practice with intent to use it at least to be interesting. I hope that someone out there will in fact do that research to forward our knowledge as a species but my interest lies in other areas. ,scientology,d46o8ua,2,t5_2qh3a

No one has ever had a credible factbased answer e.g. I saw them.My own conclusion is that LRH likely did have some kind of notes about what to deal with in OT   ... but my guess is it was the equivalent of notes scrawled on a paper napkin Perhaps the author knew what he meant when he wrote them as a memoryjog but the notes probably would not say much to someone else.The business problem that the CofS has is that theres no new material to offer. If you make it through all the processing available youre done and the CofS has nothing left to sell you. Thats one cynical but I fear accurate reason for making people retread training and auditing they completed or reissuing books because we found errors. So they have to dangle the promise of something more to be offered once some vague condition is met when all orgs churches are the size of the Old Saint Hill facility.

Though to be honest any time Im in a group and it comes up Im not shy about it and I dont try and hide it so it comes up from time to time it usually starts a long enjoyable conversation and ends up making the gathering more fun.

10497088,0,t1_dcxxh1f,For those curious about what is being talked about here refer to the Wikipedia article on Scientology and Xenu. If you want a more official document from the horses mouth so to speak you can read about the Xenu story in its original form directly from Hubbard on wiki leaks. Refer to the documents of OT III which talk about a event known as Incident II. It states quite clearly that the souls of humans the soul is referred to as a thetan in scientology and the words can be used interchangeably for a layman level discussion of the topic were once part of a galactic confederacy millions of years ago. These soulsthetans were sent to earth and trapped here. Fast forward to today and we ARE these thetans. Some of these thetans were so damaged they were unable to pick up a body the way we can and instead latch on to other peoples bodies and cause problems. These are what are referred to as body thetans which are a primary focus of the upper OT levels.This description is not meant to mock scientology. Many respected religions and belief systems have what the outsider sees as odd beliefs and crazy ideas. This is simply a matter of clarifying that Scientology does in fact teach at its upper levels that people today referring to the souls not the bodies are the same souls of those ancient aliens. While descended is a misnomer since its the same soul and not a descendant at all it would be pedantic and petty to argue that this invalidates the claim that Scientologists believe humanity is descended from ancient aliens. Based on any common sense interpretation of their beliefs and common language they unequivocally DO teach this at the upper levels.,scientology,dcxyemt,1,t5_2qh3a

The point about the clam incident from A History Of Man is not that the human race evolved from clams but that thetans have at some point in their past lives been incarnated as clams.  As you point out it is ridiculous that the book A History Of Man accepts the Piltdown Man hoax as being scientific fact but Hubbard does not say that Homo sapiens evolved from Piltdown Man Hubbard says only that thetans have lived earlier lifetimes in which they were incarnated as Piltdown Man.  The sequence of reincarnation is entirely independent from the sequence of biological evolution.Also note  although the book A History Of Man does give the age of the universe as  trillion years this figure which is already ridiculously large was later extended to four quadrillion years as L.

I think its more a byproduct of your position compared to the Overton Window if you dont know what that is I think its a VERY valuable term to be familiar with and understand you should definitely look it up. I think in your mind your hold a reasonable rational open minded view that is logical and respectful. From our point of view you hold an illogical position regarding a demonstrably false belief system. So the attitude that you are the voice of reasonable neutrality while very rational and understandable from your world view comes across as haughty self righteous and condescending. I also believe that you really are interested in communicating your ideas the best way you can and one thing we can all always improve upon is seeing how our communication is being received by the other side so to speak. Its important for us all to remember that the other person doesnt have the same world view. Going to a foreign country where a thumbs up is equivalent to the middle finger could lead us to a troublesome interaction simply because the receiving party misunderstands what we think we are communicating. Similarly when communicating with someone of a different world view we must remember that sometimes they disagree with even the most fundamental ideas we have about the nature of the universe or that their value system might be different than our own.This is perhaps the most frusterating thing about talking to religious individuals. Far too often I hear them say things about the very nature of reality or what is right vs what is wrong as if they are self evident undeniable truths. Often those truths are nothing but their own enculturated beliefs and values of which mine are different. And until I can get them to see that their values are not my values the conversation cannot move beyond that fundamental misunderstanding. ,scientology,dg6em85,1,t5_2qh3a

If the abuse is illegal it should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. If the abuse is real but not illegal the abuse should be widely exposed and the public warned so that people can make informed decisions about their religion of choice.Just so thats out of the way.Also Im STILL not a Scientologist.Alanzo,scientology,dgb2pge,1,t5_2qh3a
11642722,0,t1_dgfjqon,I think a fundamental disagreement we have is that I do not think an organization or an individual needs to be convicted to be a criminal organization. If I know a person raped someone even if I cannot prove it in a court of law and they walk away with no conviction and arent even arrested I can still consider them to be a rapist. Same goes for murderer thief etc. Knowing it happens is not the same as proving it in a court of law.There are a lot of reasons one might not pursue legal action there are still more reasons why a person might not SUCCESSFULLY pursue legal action. Our court system is flawed but for good reason. It is flawed in a way that attempts to prevent innocent people from being found guilty. A side affect of that is that guilty people are found innocent frequently. The Church of Scientology conducts lots of illegal practices but most of them are impossible to prove or are based in the concept of undue influence which is still not very well received in the legal system with only a few cases in which undue influence was cited as a major factor. But just to see if we agree on the idea of undue influence even if we disagree on other things let me layout a situation and you can tell me whether there was fault on either party or if you consider any actions taken illegal whether or not they can be proven.A family moves into a new neighborhood and a friendly neighbor becomes friends with them. He invites them over for BBQs along with the rest of the neighborhood and over time manipulates his way into being like a beloved uncle. The family has a young daughter only an infant. Over the following years he continues to manipulate the family using techniques similar to thought reform to convince the family to trust him and be comfortable around him. When the girl is older say  he is a major part of the family and begins to babysit her after school  before the family can get home. She has a great time and NO harm ever comes to her. He continues to manipulate the family and weasel ever more trust out of them. Nothing ever happens which is illegal. He never touches her or acts inappropriately toward her. But he IS grooming her. He does it over  years rather than quickly ensuring he grooms the family along with her. Finally she turns  and has sex with him. It is legal as he does not coerce her and she is a legal adult. The fact is he groomed her for  years through manipulation and indoctrination to set her up so that at  she would want to sleep with him knowing that it would be fully legal for her to do so and he couldnt be legally held responsible.Obviously the parents are shocked and both the parents and the girl realize what had happened and recognize the warning signs from over the years. Would this be criminal activity to you or was this all perfectly legal? Personally I would still consider this rape as it is OBVIOUS that undue influence was used to create a compliant rape victim who technically did provide consent. Can we recognize that consent can be coerced for rape or for anything else without using force or blackmail or any other method? Are manipulation and thought reform factors in considering whether or not something was illegal? If a Scientologist had followed Hubbards kill order on these  individuals would you consider that to be the fault of the organization or would you consider that to be the fault of the individual who pulled the trigger? Both? Would that constitute criminal behavior by the organization?,scientology,dgfpsjh,5,t5_2qh3a
