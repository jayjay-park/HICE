9861475,0,t3_5gkg6j,IMO Hels item is pretty interesting. Mixes up Arena a far bit now.Her item applies Shade to the closest enemy.Shade deals damage over time while also removing the hero from combat for  turns.This means they can not act or be acted upon.  Turn remove Heim from combat?

I agree that these games are meant to be played over long periods of time and are typically a grind to get things maxed with an option to speed it up with your credit card.

10567665,0,t3_5rbob0,I dont think its bad. Their units are just that good.Im pretty sure eventually other top players will figure out how to beat their teams. Also when youre saying that even they themselves cant beat their own teams is that true or are you just assuming?PvP is where whales outshine everyone else. If you cant keep up with the resources they throw at this game then theres just no way you can beat them. If they can be beat by any old team then theres no point in them spending at all which will make it a net loss for the company in the long run. If youre aiming for the top spots in pvp expect people to be super tryhards. This holds true to every fremium phone games with a pvp system.,valkyrie_en,dd5yq63,1,t5_3h4zn

10951515,0,t3_5wey9q,I dont know but the stats on it is nice. The ring is specifially for ymir in mind. Her role is to take out the dark and gravity crystals. If you dont take her loki is there because of his high dark resist. If you take either of them you need to take someone with high dark resist with high light damage while gravity works on units that doesnt have the ring. ,valkyrie_en,de9kkhq,1,t5_3h4zn
