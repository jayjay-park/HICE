1269062,0,t3_27ya3q,As it is on sale right now and sunk to  euro I just bought it. The game in its current state surely needs some polishing. The dinosaurs have been taken out temporarily due to server lags. But in my opinion it has potential to get a really great game. Its a huge good looking procedural generated map on one single official server which expands as more players get in. And the crafting list is quite big by now. Its simple If you want to buy it expecting to play right now and having a great experience you probably shouldnt. If you want to invest for the future save money due to the sale and be patient buy it.,beastsofprey,cicdwov,2,t5_31amg
