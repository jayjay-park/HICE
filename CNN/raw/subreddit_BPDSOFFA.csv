625554,0,t3_21aus2,First things first... Reddit is a TERRIBLE place to ask for a diagnosis.Having said that you are right about one thing. A therapist would spend more than a single session with someone to look for a pattern of behavior. From that pattern of behavior they would then attempt a diagnosis and plan a treatment. I seriously doubt a therapist worth their salt would make a diagnosis after just one session.If you have problems with anyone your sister included you should probably try to discuss that specific issue with them. Please stop saying such mean things toabout my dog We arent talking about you at all but it is private so can you please let us finish. etc. etc. It also may not hurt to point out to her that she seems to have more anxiety than most people and that a therapist could help her cope with that.

1309057,0,t1_cig1644,Nope. I work peripherally in mental health but I am not a counselor at all. I am just really deeply educated on the subject of BPD Ive been involved with someone or other with the disorder my whole life long. I also personally attended a DBT group I am not BPD but I have bipolar disorder type  and I was living in a small town and the therapeutic resources at the psych outpatient clinic were limited and DBT has good effect on nonBPD people as well and spent some time with some really dysfunctional borderline women. I learned more from them than I have in my entire life about what it means to be emotionally adrift in life and what does and doesnt work for that. I admired the hell out of those women even in their worst moments. You arent qualified to help your partner in a professional way of course. But you are qualified to support and encourage them and that is the part Im emphasizing. Again BPD folk have next to no insight into their behaviour without having it pointed out to them by caring SOFFAs and it is impossible for them to get help without coming to an awareness that how they do life is very wrong. Im not suggesting you push them to therapy but there is a difference between pushing and encouraging them. In fact Id say even mildly pushing them is less so controlling and more so trying firmly to help someone who is very entrenched in one of the most difficult mental illnesses in the DSM. Ideally you shouldnt have to but againneurotypical standards dont apply in BPD. Obviously youve tried and it hasnt worked. I certainly wont tell you to try again. Mostly I want to post in this thread because the post is a validation to leave on the basis of any abuse and could easily be taken by someone reading it who is trying to support their BPDer in a weak moment as a basis to leave and not feel badly about it. I am trying to suggest that if you are committed to trying to help them that it really isnt as black and white as this article and Eggshells suggests. ,BPDSOFFA,cigvvum,2,t5_2t6sm

1445994,0,t1_cixicdr,gtgt but you and others reading this board are responsible for the reactions of BPDers in their daily lives.gt Ah what?Sorry this wasnt very articulate. Say if my parents were going through a particularly rough patch with me which is entirely possible they may refer to the experiences and advice of people on this page or the internet in general. Theyre not stupid people they know that advice isnt always to be followed but they might consider something said by a BPDSOFFA to have more weight especially if the situations seem similar. As such they may try to incorporate this advice or experience into their dealings with me hoping that your SOFFA experience will hold true to me too. So my point is that you as a sub are not responsible to my reactions to your posts and I understand that but by giving advice and experiences within such a public forum you are inadvertently affecting the opinions and reactions of other SOFFAs who will in turn affect the actions and reactions of the BPD sufferer like myself and if the advice and experience is particularly bias towards a bitter or manipulate case of BPD then no one is a winner because the cycle of misunderstanding and mistreatment will continue.

They never EVER consider or notice their PARTNERS FEELINGS and their own behavior.gt When theyre abusive verbally emotionally sexually physically financially  covertly or overtly it is always someone elses fault.

1560736,0,t1_cjbkugs,gt using every tactic Ive learned in communicating with someone with BPD and she snapped back with some unfounded nonsense circling the issue and were back at square one. This happens to me too with my wife. For me it means that even when I think Im talking to the adult she can at any moment use this tactics to hide the adult. I was incredibly frustrated but this I want to talk like an adult to the adult. But I cant make her give me access to the adult no matter how much I tried it is something she has to decide to do. In that case she is winning she knows I want the adult she hides the adult. In such cases there is no point in demanding to see the adult. The more I try the more she evades. While I do that she is really the child. The only solution that works for me is to stay strong with my existing boundaries be the adult and treat her like a child with love respect and consistency. Im going to therapy to learn how to manage this better and the hope is that by being consistent and respectful eventually my wife might feel safe enough to discuss this difficult issues without triggering her. Or maybe not. But for now it isnt the right time to talk to her like an adult.In your case it might mean that the time isnt right for this meeting not yet. Stay firm stay consistent this helps you stay sane and will teach her the boundaries. That is the strength of boundaries you can set them without having a sitdown with her you can enforce them without the adult in her understanding them and even the child in her can learn them eventually. It is incredibly draining because it would be so much easier if you talked to her adult side but it might not be possible at least for now.,BPDSOFFA,cjbwt9f,1,t5_2t6sm

1648177,0,t1_cjmwf91,gtI avoid people who mistreat me at all costs.Well thats good it can definitely prevent you from getting into unfortunate situations.gtI guess different people have different thresholds for being screamed at having things thrown at them etcThis is true people do have varying levels of thresholds for this. However this isnt why people walk into and get stuck in situations with BPDs. BPDs can be very manipulative tricky and convincing. They live in their own world that has nothing to do with reality and they can be very proficient at gaslighting and brainwashing their SOs that their world is reality even though it isnt. Getting mistreated is one thing but BPDs can convince you that not only are you not being mistreated but that youre actually the problem. A lot of people fall for this. Then there are the highlows of a realtionship with a BPD. So there you have several different reasons why people can get stuck in these situations with BPDs.In your other comments you mention that you have been in several relationships with BPDs and that tells me you would benefit from taking a long deep look inward to see why youre continuously ending up in relationships with BPDs only some  or some low number of the pop have BPD so the fact that you have been in multiple relationships with BPD is not a coincidence. Once you figure out why youre attracted toattracting BPDs then you can take the next steps and hopefully eventually prevent even getting in a relationship with a BPD.Anyways Im not trying to offend you at all simply offering my advice in case youre interested.

She is an adult. The only reason in my opinion would be if legally you are somehow in obligated to deal with this if the contract is in your name or something. In such a case then DONT trust her to deal with this. Do it all yourself clear everything up with the landlord as much as possible. In fact even asking her to pay for bills might in the end turn into a battle. If she tries to create drama think hard how much leverage you have to make her pay maybe not much and how much it would cost you and think of the price of your peace and decide. Oh I just read that she wants to buy your laptop. You can use this for leverage to get her to pay her part. Like say you will give her a good deal only if she gives you the money for the bills at the same time you give her the laptop to close all business deals at the same time.gt Also she sent me a link today on FB I did not open it so she does not know if I opened the message or not probably she was checking whether I will still be reachable...Yes she might just be testing to see if she can keep you still around and the other guy as well. gt Anyway I feel lonely right now. And I have no clue whether I can create healthy relationshipBig bear hug Sir Bulbov. I can almost feel here how hard this is for you. BPDs can leave us very confused emotionally and it will take you a while to get your head cleared up. I doubt you have  PD but I do believe that working on yourself is a good idea regardless so do what it takes on that. Spend time with your friends you will need some healing time before you feel in good shape to date again. This is perfectly normal.

Or I tried a new fishing spot didnt catch much but the weather sun and breeze was fantastic.These types of experiences will lead to better conversations with people in your life.The point here is to start living your life instead of just being in it waiting for something to happen on its own.From my own experience  years married to a BPD erased every bit of individualism I had.  Hobbies and interests all were pushed to the corner by her.  I was made to feel guilty for anything that brought me pleasure so it took a while to get back to where I felt comfortable doing things that brought me pleasure.  There was always this irrational fear in my subconscious that said if you brew a batch the smell will set her off and youll have hell to pay. or if you go off on a short fishing trip her abandonment issues will go full tilt and youll have hell to pay.Over time I was conditioned to not do anything at all for myself.  So understandably it took time to recondition myself after she was out of my life.So my postBPDSO advice to you is to force yourself to start doing things that interest you.

2866694,0,t1_cntqnwu,Im saying it is more effective to understand the psychological dynamics of how BPD manifests especially from the man Kernberg who essentially is the primary underwriter of BPD here. I have no interest aside from replying to an anonymous internet post and many people do the same with DBT and all of Linehans techniques that have its inherent limitations. I have named a few book and author. The book I mentioned by Masterson is intended for clinicans and nonclinicans alike  which he explains the psychology of BPD folks manifest. Additionally youre also utilizing psychological frameworks as well with tantrums and attachment theory.Im willing talk over the phone so I can explain this perspective better. I cannot simplify where I then inadvertently make bad claims and you have my apologizes for offending my comments and analysis here. You are solutionfocused and Im suggesting a completely different perspective but obviously am unable to present it in an ideal fashion. Such is with psychoanalytic theory. Perhaps your mind will change after reading the Search for The Real Self. So be it if I am preachy here that is all I can do for now just remember I was in chaotic dynamics with a BPD parent too.I have nothing to gain and A lot of the professional BPD community owes it to Kernberg even Marsha Linehan herself. He had the same issues initially because his work was esoteric and inaccessiblebut also eloquent and informative.
