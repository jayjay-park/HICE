3740,0,t3_1u5tnz,Antimage should not have been the one roaming earlygame. Viper is a decent snowball hero he had a great early game whereas AM didnt really. AM should have stayed in the top lane and jungle to farm while Viper roamed with the rest of t he team to create space.It felt like the whole game you guys were overstating your advantage. You were tower diving at  minutes where none of your team had much more than k HP most had much less and they had so much lockdown that when you did overreach which was often they could just pick you off really easily under the tower. You didnt respect the damage that towers can do early game and you didnt respect the amount of burst damage and disable they had and you paid for that again and again.AM has really good mobility and having a battlefury means not only that he farms really fast but that he also is a really good split pusher. I think a good game plan for you guys would have been to roam as  keep the other team busy and let AM split push on the other side of the map. You kill a creep wave jump into the jungle for a few camps kill the next creep wave rinse and repeat. Hes not a good snowball hero he needs much more farm than what kills alone can provide and I think the early basher wasnt that good. There werent many disables that the Manta would have helped against on the enemy team but it would have made it much easier to split push and greatly increased damage output in teamfights. The basher would have been good later but you could see in fights he didnt have enough AS to proc it consistently.There wasnt that much more I felt you personally could have done except roam more as a group instead of individually and coordinate teamfights a bit better. But your team as a whole could have roamed as a group more been a bit more patient and been more careful.I dont know the hero pool since Valve doesnt show it for CD but I think the draft was decent. They drafted a team much more focused on lockdown than you guys did and you just played to their strengths by overextending.Just as a note when you ion shell a creep wave you should always ion shell the second or third creep since the first creep is the one that always takes aggro and always dies first. This way at least your ion shell runs out instead of dying with the creep.,learndota2,ceev3ea,2,t5_2tta4
12571,0,t3_1u8ian,I think the general rule of why certain itemsabilities dont work with illusions is that they would provide an exponential advantage which the designers want to mitigate. The spirit of the concept of illusions is that you have some units that look like your hero and hence can be mistakenly targeted that do a little damage and take a little damage and are weak to magic and dispelling effects.If illusions worked with  effects like bash then they would effectively increase the likelihood of the effect beyond what its balanced to do. If they worked with Auras or cleave or orbs then you could get a ridiculously amplified effect from such things. If they worked with damage block or regenlifesteal theyd be tough enough that it could be too difficult for the other team to use damage to differentiate illusions from the real unit....and then theres the odd counter example. Broods Incapacitating Bite is a solid counter to the multibash is unfair argument. Lunas Moon Glaive is a counter to the stacking cleave is too much damage argument. And rather notably critical strike.So I think the final ideology is that they want to keep the spirit of their concept of illusions but there are exceptions that they allow. Given the themes of the exceptions my guess is that theyre allowed because those herositems would be notably less usefulless chosen without said illusion ability retention. Incapacitating Bite could theoretically be used to great effect via illusions but its not fantastic normally anyhow and it takes some doing to multitarget with them. Antimage PL and Lunas illusion advantages are central to their playstyles.So theres no hard and fast rule but if you remember the notable exceptions like Diffusal Moon Glaive and Mana Break youll be alright.,learndota2,cefv68e,1,t5_2tta4
16470,0,t1_ceg92em,Id like to add some advice on luxury items for Undying because everything else has been covered. This advice is assuming youve build your Mek Blademail Pipe and Vlads or you have a good reason not to go for some of those.Assault Cuirass is worth getting if you are still getting focused by rightclicker carries and the enemy team is staying up too long in fights. It makes your Tombstone more impactful too. If youre finding yourself getting lowish on Mana I like to pick up a Shivas Guard. It gives you  mana and . mana per second regen  and the slow helps to keep enemies in range of your zombie friends. If you need way more mana then Bloodstone is actually a fine item. It has cheap components so if youre dying rather often it is much easier to build than a lot of  your other lategame options. BKB might be worthwhile if you are getting constantly chainstunned  though it can be tougher to build. Heart of Tarrasque is overkill on the STRHP you should be tanky enough not to need it and IMO it is even more selfish than Bloodstone. Besides if youre dying enough to want it youre going to have a hell of a time farming the  gold you need for the Reaver.,learndota2,cegb4sl,4,t5_2tta4

The only thing to worry about is if the enemy has high physical damage. Vanguard blocks more if YOU are a melee hero it doesnt care what the enemy is.gt What are some other good defensive melee items?Poor Mans Shield.Also note that youre usually better off getting armor items for tankiness and flat hp boost items for reflectiness. Shivas Guard is an example of high armor it gives you . Its flat hp counterpart is Rod of Atos no armor but gives you  hp.gt Blademail seems decent and around the same price range if youre getting wailed on but doesnt have defensive stats.Because with Blademail you have to be a hero who likes to take as much damage as possible. If you reduce you damage taken youre only reducing what gets reflected.An example is Centaur Warrunner. This hero usually just wants to build  hearts and just reflect a ton of damage.

336136,0,t1_cffi6jr,In MOBAs roles are often given a series of numbers from . These numbers designate things like needuse of farm on the low end and lack there of on the high end. So a hard  as I put it is a character that doesnt need too much farm. These are usually characters that have useful spells and that dont usually do much damage via rightclicks. As such a character theyre responsible for buying items to help the team.So a hard  is a playercharacter who buys all the wards the courier and upgrade dustsmoke Mekanism and anything else the group needs. Normally a support that needs a little farm will be the  and theyll buy some of the wards or something. This happens in double dual lanes or trilanes. But a solo offlane Seer can allow the  to get some more carry items if theyre a jungle semicarry for instance. He plays the hard  by absorbing the s share of team item responsibilities.

Good Brood players Im certainly not one of them! will sometimes just take over the enemy jungle as soon as their tier  tower is down and then amass a huge army that way. I think the last time I saw it done was no Merlinis stream and if youre interested you can check vods here  Yes you can either bind them to a control group or use the default select all other units. If you dont have that bound you can find it in the settings. There are three settings which are quite useful select hero double tap will center on you hero select all units and select all other units. I usually just use the control all other units or if I only want a portion of them Ill just manually drag select like in Starcraft and other rts games and send them off so I can farm many camps at once. The default key for toggling between units under your control is tab.Unrelated questions Im not sure. Hopefully someone else will have an answer for you. Im also afraid I cant really answer this one since Im no expert but Id think any decent headset with mic should be just fine. Some people even just use their built in laptop mic so I dont think youd need anything fancy. When youre up against a Pudge you need to watch your positioning. Always keep creeps between you and him and that way he cant hook you. If he goes for a rune and you dont have vision of it warn your teammates Im assuming youre playing mid in this example that he has a rune and you dont know which one. For safety assume that he has an invis or a haste and position yourself so that he cant just run up to you hoook you and rot you down or just stand just outside of tower range and hook you. If you have an orb attack use it on him a lot in lane or just any spamable spell that you can harass him with. If you can afford to trade with him do it because it will keep him from having hp to waste on rotting for last hits.,learndota2,cfmiyuz,2,t5_2tta4

So if you pick  range harassers who can keep their enemies on theirr toes all the time tiny and cent wont be able to execute their combo. That being said I would like to correct MrTidy. Templar Assassin should never find herself on the lane with tinycent unless they went mid. Cause ta on any other lane is useless. Secondly Double edge is true damage. But it is blocked by magic immunity.To kill enemy with this combo both heroes should be lvl . So as I said pick harassers. From the top of my head id say viper weaver or clinkz.

841129,0,t3_23rhjk,On Kunkka you should generally be building some progression like Stout Shield you should generally start with this as any melee farmer Bottle if mid  which is most typical for Kunkka also allows you to store DD runes which are almost broken on him Phase Boots Shadow Blade BKB  Daedalus Daedalus  BKB AC or more Daedalus note  Urn is also viable if youre roaming a lot and involved in a lot of kills Drums are viable if youre not the primary carry getting involved early in team fighting or in recovery modePhase gives you early raw damage. On a hero like Kunkka that is built around his Tidebringer Cleave raw damage is all you care about.Shadow Blade is core because on the hit out of invis you deal an additional  damage. While this is not able to crit it will splash when Tidebringer is up. This gives you huge early game burst AoE. Its also a powerful positioning tool.BKB is a general necessity for any carry or semicarry.Daedalus is the other main component of your build. The crits factor into Tidebringer as well as having a good cost to damage ratio. Though stacking Daedalus has diminishing return it still helps you get closer to a guaranteed crit. The damage also isnt bad.Stacking works as follows  Daedalus   chance to crit    Daedalus   chances to crit  .  Daedalus   chances to crit  .  Daedalus   chances to crit  .CleavesTo play him more effectively you also need to understand the mechanics behind cleaving. This applies to Tidebringer as well as Bfury if you go that route.Damage dealt by Cleave is affected only by armor type not armor value. As a hero the only type of armor that takes less damage is fortified towers. So what this means is that if you hit a unit and have  cleave they are basically going to take .attackdamage if they are in range and it will not be reduced by their armor nor can it be evaded.In the case of Tidebringer the cleave is  on a single attack. This is why it is so valuable. If there is a hero with  armor and Evasion you can hit a creep and the cleave will hit them for  of your attack damage or crit if you have Daedalus.This is why you just stack raw damage on Kunkka. NOTE Cleave only works on secondary targets. Your primary target will still factor in armor values evasion etc. NOTE Cleave damage is based on your heros damage NOT the damage taken by the primary target NOTE If you miss your primary target not Cleave will take placeBattlefuryBfury is generally a waste unless you are playing Kunkka as safe lane farmer and have it by  min.Even then Bfury is an item that says Im going to get this early and farm with it efficiently to get my next core item.This is a bad place for Kunkka to be in because his skillset works well earlymid game then he scales into late game with his Tidebringer amp Crits.In contrast a hero like AntiMage can get Bfury and then hop around the jungle farming quickly. He also naturally wants to build into Manta Style which allows him to splitpush safely with Illusions that splash.Bfury only does  things for Kunkka really. It is a fairly costeffective source of damage. It provides a secondary cleave      Sources of cleave stack each functioning independently  so you can have Tidebringer cleave then if they are in range the hero will then be affected by Bfury cleave,learndota2,cgzw0h3,14,t5_2tta4

1004853,0,t1_chi877c,gt First but also the least appreciated is that having your  strongest early game heroes your supports in the same lane DRASTICALLY increases your teams ability to threaten the enemy.  aggressive supportsany rd hero can almost always guarantee a kill against an enemy unless they either have a very strong escape which we will get to in a second or their lane partner has strong defensive skills to save them. What this means is that whenever both supports are off the map the enemy needs to play much more carefully out of fear.This also isnt just the least appreciated its also the most important.  The effects shape the normal bracket meta.When you put a hard carry offlane you give a free pass to the mid hero.

Second skill is a bubble that can be cast on any friendly or enemy units and makes them do DPS to nearby enemies lets him lasthit from afar when using it on friendly creeps and force melee heroes away from the wave when using it on enemy creeps or heroes.gtQuinn Designed as an attack damage carry is more played as a solo lane assassin with a ranged standard form and an ultimate that turns you into a mobile falcon with a percentmissinghp nuke. Also has a blind.Vipers first skill has an Orb effect which adds a slow and DoT to his normal attacks. Manually used orbs have a cool interaction with towers and creeps where it counts as casting a spell instead of using an attack so this can be used to harass without taking damage from creeps and to dive towers somewhat safely as if you are orb walking the tower will prioritize you over creeps based on who is closer. Second skill is a passive that adds bonus damage based on how much HP the enemy creepherotower is missing. Third skill is a passive that increases his resistance to magic damage and makes any nontower that damages him get slowed and take a DoT.Skills that destroydodge projectiles are mostly nonexistent in dota.

1123535,0,t3_26zjva,Grab the biggest baddest creeps typically. Try to gank whenever anyone is overextended and you think it will work. Get a smoke or two to use to gank mid early  go around behind them and try to gank if they leave their side of high grounds.Creeps that are best for ganking are the net trolls the stun centaurs. The slow tomato and the kamehameha satyr arent as good but can still be useful especially in the presence of other disables than what you bring to the table. Typically you want to net then stun then slow with your hero as they try to run but if you have to slow at the start to get them in net range its not a huge loss. Remember when coming in to ping and tell your allies to go as well etc. Alpha wolves seem sort of nice but early on you dont deal enough damage to make their aura strong compared to other stuff and later on they just die to AOE and dont live very long on a single charm so theyre really trap options most of the time. Remember that if you drive enemy heros off without killing them it can be an excellent time to push and take an early tower to get some gold flowing. Try to max slow and untouchable first with only a single point in heal then get the heal maxed last ult at  of course. Max untouchable is hilarious early on. You can use it in a scheme to do rosh earlyish but not level  as well  you can tank it really well. Cute tricks  if you can stack a camp a few times you can farm it with a tornado channeled by a wildwing. This is more efficient than normal jungling but requires setup. You can lane control espeically mid lane by sending the harpy with chain lightning to spam it on a relevant hero while microing it a bit. It is brutally effective in early levels. Tornado harass is also quite strong but pushes the lane more and is harder to micro now that tornado vision is smaller than it once was.Big items Consider aghs strongly it is quite good on enchantress. If noone else is getting it get the mek  but ideally someone else will  and consider ranged int semicarry standards  orchids and sheepsticks. I like orchid best. It depends what your team needs  if you need the silence and additional DPS of the Orchid the maxdps and slight general tankiness of the Aghs or the hard disable of the sheepstick. Later on in the game youll probably get all three if it goes late.Later on when pushing down towers dominate a lane creep and use it to pull enemy creeps away from the tower when youre trying to take it.Only get Midas if your team is extremely short hard carry and extremely heavy on good early game stuff already. In the midgame you basically stop dominating creeps except to do things like stack camps for a carry or pull creeps when pushing. The fact that the creeps have a duration mean in the mid and lategame its not worth enchantresses time to always be disappearing into jungle when she could be participating instead. ,learndota2,chw08uy,10,t5_2tta4

1143902,0,t1_chy4xo8,What you are describing here are more   ganking core heroes. They want to get key levels usually lvl  and then put pressure on the map. This is OK and at your level of play this is expected especially with the heroes you listed.What OP is referring to when he says roamers are support heroes that have good lvl  slows or stuns cm veno vs etc.. They will generally go to lane with the safe lane carry to ensure that he can get farm and if hes OK they will rotate to other lanes usually utilizing the item smoke of deceit to try and kill the enemys mid or carry. This gives your own solo heroes an advantage that they can carry into the mid game but if its unsuccessful it can leave your supports under leveled so there is some risk involved. Based on what youve written I wouldnt worry too much about this until you get to higher levels of play.

Its essentially a long distance relationship but for gaming.Practices can be a variety of things.ScrimsMost will look for highlevel scrims. The TMM system is garbage so you have to look outside it for scrim partners. rcompDota is one venue NADotA might have some scrims but I kind of doubt it There are skype groups but mostly for Tier  teams There were some IRC scrim groups like dotacw or something but Im not sure if they exist anymoreOften the best way to find scrim partners is by adding captains of teams you play in tournaments and leagues.Even pubbing together can work. Sometimes you get v in pubs and that can be decent. If the whole team cant get together its not a bad option to just have  of you pub. The more you play together the better you understand each other.AnalysisTeams will often look back on replays and analyze them. This can be tricky since you have to manually sync times unless that changed recently.This gives you a chance to provide constructive criticism analyze rotations tactical decisions and the draft as a whole.Even watching pro matches together can be useful since you can talk about what theyre doing and learn a lot more than just watching on your own. For ticketed events only one player actually needs the ticket the rest of your party can mooch for a live match maybe replay as well dunno though.DrillsSome teams do these others dont.This is usually stuff like learning how to play a particular matchup.So lets say your offlaner got wrecked by a particular trilane. You can recreate that scenario and practice it to learn its weaknesses or perhaps realize a different offlane should have been picked.Mids may need to find a partner if someone on your team is not a good mid as well. But you can also try things like running a dual mid against your mid for practice.Most of drills is to understand how to play out matchups and expose weaknesses.You can also do them to build synergy e.g. landing Shadow Demon disrupt gt Mirana Arrow combo.If your team is lower level you can practice things like last hitting stackingdoing pull throughs as support learning ward positions amp counterward placement so that it wont block spawns etc.,learndota2,ci4u9dq,1,t5_2tta4

And unless they are a hero who makes a good offlaner to begin with then they will not be able to get any farm because they will need to stay far away from the creep wave for fear of being ganked.

Also  manasec for  dmgsec is not bad if you use it to defend towers where you cannot stand in the front. My preference to skip Chakram falls to its  initial cost.Before Bloodstone or with a poor charged one that extra  can make a difference while lacking extra armor and regen with less Reactive Armor.A full combo with Lvl Chakram clears an entire lane wave. Higher Chakram only slightly kills the leaders of the hard camps faster.Farming wise Higher Reactive Armor provides better sustain to farm lanejungle then push lanestowers or enter a fight at a moments notice.

1520175,0,t1_cj6ek7t,I agree allchat mute ultimately is a bad habit for Dota especially higher tier but backlash can drive players especially solo away from the game all together.Also nochat mode or default muteall does not give a chance for an ally to show cooperativeness and patience.Dota should be played alongside patient teammates and friends. It helps them become comfortable with the game and its community.Solo MM isnt ideal for players who cannot handle constant berating while learning the high learning curve without some encouragement. Dota demands a lot and while communication is key it is not necessary to win a pub game. Mute toxic players and move on. It helps focus on improving over arguingworrying since there is so much a single person can handle.,learndota2,cj6txh2,1,t5_2tta4

1596843,0,t3_2cjwkb,Troll Warlord is not known for his burst damage. All his skills are focused on manfighting pretty much any other hero in the game. Lets have a look at what he has Ability to change between melee and ranged forms. He also gains a passive Bash in melee form along with some stats. You should prefer fighting in melee form.  Either a ranged slow or a close ranged nuke that can blind people giving you some evasion against them. A really nasty attack speed buff which get better and better when focusing the main target. Global AS buff.All of these abilities makes troll simply the best single target sustained DPS hero in the game. There is no hero in the entire game who can pick a melee manfight with a similarly farmed Troll Warlord. You should build your hero around this fact which means you should aim for some of the following items. AntiKite As every manfighter hero Troll has this big issue called being kited. He has his ranged form to do something about that but that is really not enough if people just stun you and run away. This means you want two things Some movespeed so you can get more hits in while chasing and protection against disables. This brings up some ideas Sange and Yasha Manta Style Phase Boots Black King Bar. BKB is probably the most essential part of your build you almost always want to get one. If you are rolling you can get a Shadowblade early so you can gank and sneak up on people.  Sustain  While Troll has a lot of things a good manfighter needs in his skills but he still lacks one thing. Lifesteal. He is probably one of the best heroes to get a HotD and later a Satanic on because when you want to use it you will probably have some insane amount of AS thanks to your passive. This will result in some bashing and even more damage thanks to the fact that heroes wont run away from you if they are getting their heads bashed in. Skadi can be a good choice too if you really need to live trough something like a Chronosphere. MORE DAMAGE This is what you cant get enough of. Get Daedalus MKB Butterfly. If the enemy team has lots of physical damage AC should be considered. MaelstromMjollnir are good to accelerate your farm too. I dont really like butterfly since you might get countered by MKB anyway.,learndota2,cjgg989,2,t5_2tta4
1606390,0,t3_2cp2fg,This has already been said but Drow is a very aggressive and squishy pick. She needs kills and farm fast to be good for the rest of the game. I used to play her a bit more but Ive seen both against me and against others that shutting down a Drow early and for as long as possible before she gets  is a good way to screw her over. Also those weird MoM builds make her EVEN squishier. All she has going for her as far as survivability is a ton of armor later from her ult bonus agility but she loses both that AND her damage when anyone steps near her. This being said if you DO like Drow and want me to go more in depth on how I would recommend playing her what to watch out for etc Id be happy to help. Im not the best but I am  with Drow in matchmaking.Windranger meanwhile is honestly built to be a huge cunt. Pardon my language She flits in and out of fights and its very difficult to ever nail her down or get off enough damage to kill her. Especially with WindrunForce StaffPhase Boots Windrunners will VERY often get away with lt health. Its not worth the bother of chasing her though she can move faster than you and Windrun has a pretty low cooldown considering she cant take any physical damage while in that state. Oh and did I mention that her Windrunning past you also slows YOU down? Most sane people I know will go for other kills.Which is a good point to remember. You are the carry. I have played too much  position and known the pressure to stay alive. Oftentimes Ill be the only real carry on our team and if I die were totally boned. I used to often rambo into fights as youre saying you do now. If youre the only one doing damage and getting levels and youre on the sidelines as much as youre in fights then your team is going to have a bad time. Games like that are still winnable but oftentimes through amazing support play and not so much my shoddy Bloodseeker play. endrantOkay so as I mentioned above Id be very happy to get into a huge discussion on how to play Drow or Razor or anyone else. Im not a perfect expert but I may have played a few games more than you and clocked a significant amount of hours over the past two years.

For high physical damage teams they are best for maximizing that damage with Weave and Wave of TerrorVengeance Aura respectively and neither of them requires a whole lot of farm  which as the only support on a carry team youre not going to see much of.Dazzle provides greater survivability while Venge provides easy CC and a decent initiation not that you lacked mobile heroes in this case.,learndota2,cjo0epg,1,t5_2tta4

Creeps are gold but lets pretend theyre worth . The difference is creeps    gold which means you can get one of your expensive items m sooner and have that buyback you need at the end of the game.One thing I notice is your LH suck. Even if youre support your LH shouldnt be shit. My rule of thumb is creeps per m if youre a carry obviously you wont hit it in every m especially if youre new or bad and  of that if youre a support. It ramps up later so IDK how much you should have that lateTry creating a lobby game pick sven with a QB and nothing else than see how many creeps you can farm with no one in the lane. Dont forget to hit your own creeps so the lane isnt always under the enemy towerThe first time I played sven in memory a few weeks ago I LH  times in m seconds when I was alone.

But I actually had the same problem as you  despite strong farming and split pushing I would lose a lot of games. This is because a lot of people arent expectingable to handle a v lane and by jungling you force one of your teammates into that.If the enemy lane has any stuns they can kill your solo laner any time he goes in for a last hit with a little coordination. Leaving your teammate to a hard lane like that isnt worth even a six minute midas.

If you use either terminology people will know what you mean.Secondly the optimal words here are can or cannot. Technically any agi hero is more adept at carrying than int or strength on the basis of how the stats work. What your talking about is strictly hard carries. Many characters can carry harder than others and there are tradeoffs sure. Bountys kit doesnt really lend itself to hard carrying but he can carry. BKBs can shut down OD while its up. Would you say bristle can hard carry? Because a team I want to say dk ran a bristle hard carry in early rounds of TI and wrecked. The sixslot argument is fine if youre talking about a comp built to go to six items which rarely happens.

But as far as I read he wants to play him as a carry.Im giving you my playstyle. If anyone thinks different its ok Im not telling you how you should play this hero just giving you some information to play with.As a carry Alch there is only one way to stomp unless youre against total noobs snowballing youre way to victorty. You need to FARM.If uncontested in the hands of a great last hitter  efficient jungler its pretty much gg  min. Alchemists skillset is made to farm up in such a speed he has more gold to spend than the enemy carry in midgame. And if his gold is spend in the right way you are gonna stomp.There are  things you need to consider during the game. How will my lane go and what items do I need to own my opponent carry carry as most farmed enemy hero  best enemy player ussually I look at the KDA of the enemy team.Laning fase is import because of leveling the right skills and buying the right starting items. If left uncontested in lane buy quilingshieldtango. If being herassed buy shieldtangosalvex branch.If youre up against much herassment due to solo laning or up against  ranged enemies go  skillpoint Q at start. If youre not farming youre never gonna be the carry you need to be. I know youre gonna push the lane. Just get some farm until level  and go jungle.if level  last hit faster you will push lane but you can rotate jungle until you can go back to lane for some juicy creeps. Farm as much as you can. youre ult will let you junglepush without going back to base. If youre up against good players they will gank you gt buy wards if supports dont buy them!By this time youre are starting to get close to youre first big item choice. This is so crucial that If picked up the wrong item youre are going to feed. As I see you played  games this is going to be youre challange.There are three options here that I go for.Shadow Blade  maelstrom  radiant.Shadowblade for close up fights vs Sniper  Drow  anoying fed supports with big ulties. Bring them down fast by getting in close while invis and channeling youre stun. Id also go for this if they trying to gank you alot or if youre team is lacking initiation.Maelstrom is great for farming up youre AC. Youre ridiculous AS this earlymidgame  maelstrom passive is going to wreck teams. Go for this build if youre the only heavy autoattacker.Radiant. If left totally uncontested you can walk out of the jungle with this item around  minutes. Id go for this always if Im left uncontested and no more than  stunner in the enemy team. Just push lanes farm jungle until AC and just go killing or teamfight to wreck faces.. Buy HoT after the rampage I used to go Armlet too but never done that lately. Its a great first core item because it works well with youre ult. But I prefer more AoE damage or initiation.Only buy BKB if youre in Harry Potter game full of magical crap and stuns. then go for it as a second Item.If ganked alot or team is feeding and youre in no way getting any gold soon buy medaillion. But youre probably fucked unless you win a teamfight.Never buy Midas unless you can get it under  minutes. Never buy BF unless youre trolling alchio gt BF gt rapier build or up against a fed BroodPL etc.BTW If people start to rage because youre only farming  no tower is contested gt mute. Youre not helping youre team if youre not farming up the Items. Youre the carry you are supposed to bring victory to youre team. Youre hero is item dependend in a carry role. Alch is made in a carry role to be a midgame demolisher due to pure gold advantage through farming   more items.

Forget about mmr just ignore it and work to get better your mmr will rise with you. Try out a wide variety of heroes and roles Compared to LoL everything in this game is situational never blindly follow a build and dont be afraid to buy something different to help you win Have fun but not at others expense if you are in a ranked game try and win and if your team doesnt do something they should dont be afraid to pick up the pieces.This game has a steep learning curve but dont be afraid just jump in and have fun it doesnt matter if you lose.,learndota2,ckp6lwk,1,t5_2tta4

2119155,0,t1_cl96s3i,You havent played  of the characters in the game. You need to play a wider variety of heroes and understand the game more thoroughly. You are still a beginner its time to dig deep and learn heroes so you can figure out how to play against them.In this match you went straight for Aghs but I think that Euls would have been better here because they have a lot of fairly tanky heroes and they have a lot of heroes where Euls would be useful against. You got only one point in Mana drain early game if you are in the offlane mana drain is huge for opening up options for you to be agressive or to keep them from farming. If you are in safe lane mana drain gives a lot more space to your carry. Personally its better than hex early on. Its kinda like when people dont max ether shock early as shadow shaman you get the most use out of mana drain early game compared to mid or late game.You picked drow to go mid that was the biggest mistake here against most likely a shadow fiend or sniper both which absolutely destroy drow mid. Even if it was a PA PA would have destroyed you mid. Face it this is one of those games where you handicapped yourself sorely.Your ES skill build here is incorrect. You max fissure first yes but you get one point in aftershock and max enchant totem. Early levels havin a  damage swing is going to be more than the extra . seconds of stun and  damage from aftershock being maxed. I prefer enchant then blink ult then swing then fissure then enchant then swing again. Always enchant before blinkult and your skill build leads me to believe you dont play like this. Also ES doesnt really suit this lineup given what the enemy has. The enemy wants it to go to late game and ES is generally a defensive support. You already have shadow demon and lich so those two are generally hard supports so you needed to play a strong offlaner or a carry if slardar was okay with offlaning and be able to push with that offlaner or carry.,learndota2,cl96vb6,1,t5_2tta4

2192732,0,t3_2k5luq,Take a look at carries who will still be able to contribute even if they dont have the best farm.  Some examples Drow Ranger  agi  level .  On a ranged agi hero at a skill level where everyones farm is kinda low.  Totally OP at low mmr. Sven builtin double damage and a stun.  Hes played as a support too so you know even if you are shut down you can still do things Wraith Kings another similar hero Luna huge ultimate doesnt require farm.  Plus she can farm the jungle quickly which means that even if you do lose badly in lane you can still come back.Weavers tough because he wont do much without items yet he has a terrible animation and no skills that increase his damage or his farm.I also want to add even though Im listing heroes here I dont think your problem is really about choosing the right or wrong hero.  Just staying alive and farming well is more important than which carry you have.  However until you get to a point where you are confident carrying these heroes can give you the opportunity to practice without ruining games.

2205023,0,t3_2kcrmc,Im watching the game now. Hopefully my feedback helps. Im a  PUB Meepo player who has spent a LOT of time trying to figure out how to make micro easier on Meepo.Im going to try to give specific and general feedback. I absolutely love playing Meepo and I am only making notes in hopes they will be helpful. I hope they are.. In our range  a  lane split is pretty much always the norm unless someone is jungling. Fun thing about Meepo is you can literally find farm everywhere. Let your team choose the lanes and fill the empty slot. Youll catch up if you farm correctly.. You spend a lot of time waiting to stack the small camp and pull the lane. While committing three people to a lane may not be the best idea in pub games it means you should be able to secure yourself farm. Spend more time lasthitting creeps and less worrying about lane equilibrium..   You can buy that mask to complete your stuff at the side shop if you dont feel confident in getting in and out of the side shop save the money and wait until the lane pushes up..   You can stand to be just a tad more aggressive about your last hitting. Ursa and Huskar can be very tanky but you can use Poof to harass them while getting those last hits. If youre going to use Poof use it while creeps are at about  health or dropping. Youre auto attack comes quick after a Poof so consider that as well I have autoattack after spell casting on..   Earthbind is an amazing ability. This is why Meepo can be such an amazing laning partner. By level  youre able to keep the enemy locked in place for a stupid amount of time. Consider skilling this first IF you have partner in your lane. Trust your carries to help follow up. The tossing of the net in our MMR is actually awesome for our laning partners. They tend to followup with you more often than not.  Also at this point youre waiting more time on pulling the small camp for little to no benefit to you. While youre waiting to stack the camp the enemies are getting guaranteed free farm and youve left your laning partner alone. You have better chances of getting more gold if you stay in lane. Spend more time working on getting farm either by last hitting or by Poofing. Meepo can afford to use Poof often because it harasses and itll help you get to level  faster.. Melee creeps will often switch target to the closet target when you run away. But if you attack move with your damaged Meepo to another Meepo ALL creeps will switch targets to that Meepo. Use this to guarantee the switch. Also start staggering your Poofs when jungling youll kill them a bit faster and cause more damage with one Meepo is attacking while the other is casting.. You show a fair amount of confidence when splitting your Meepos but get used to moving them by rightclicking your minimap.. I have three binds Select Primary Unit  Select All Units  Select All Other Units . This allows me to control Meepo Prime and all the clones separately and then all together by meeting in the middle pressing . You could tend to lose control or forget about Meepos. Control Groups dont really work for me so I bind those instead but however you do it make sure you always know where your units are and who you have selected.. Attack Move is your best friend when playing Meepo. This allows you know what a Meepos going to do once it gets to its location or on its way. Get used to attack moving a Meepo to farm the small camp while you control Meepo prime. When in team fights attack moving with all your units selected is amazing to ensure your Meepos are actually hitting things instead of just moving around..   Geostrike is awesome but you lose a kill by not being able to stop Lina from running away. Skill Earthbind first or second and get used to using it at all levels. It helps so much..    You spend a lot of time chasing Lina. This is the kind of situation where having both of your Meepos selected and pressing TAB to switch units allows you to have unified movement control of your Meepos while still having access to eachs skills. Notice how you lose control of Meepos and one just stops doing anything even though had a lot of health on the bugger. Geostrike might have given Lina enough slow to catch her earlier.. Poof out the healthy Meepo instead of sending the damaged one back to base. Let the damaged Meepo run if you know the path is safe. This allows you to get back into the battle quicker.. Throw your nets our much father than you think they need to be. They require a LOT of leading.. Get in there and start clearing the waves once you have at least three points into Poof! You have a lot of pushing power through this plus more farm.. Keep your boots on Strength to start with then go to agility. You first want more health and then later once you have more items more attack speed..   By this time you should be using two Meepos to farm hard jungle camps and sending the other down to bottom lane to get that free farm down there. Your goal is to always have your Meepos working to get gold and then you need to be present for team fights and often. You are a team player not just your own army..   You spend a lot of screen focus on your alternate Meepos trying to set them up for the next camp while Meepo Prime is in hella dangerous territory. Trust your minimap more and use control groups or my method above to alternate on Meepos.I could keep going on but I feel youre still trying to figure out how to control your Meepos and rotate between them comfortable. Try the method I list in number eight. It helps me get over that hump quite comfortably. Thats the first step the next is getting used to moving Meepos in that small ass minimap.I wish you the very best and to answer your original question...skip Vlads Offering and go for Scythe first. Pipe wasnt the best choice this game since you had a lot of physical damage rightclickers. It just slowed you down when getting a Heart or Skadi or some big item like that after your Scythe. Also dont sell your boots unless youre replacing them with Boots of Travel. Vlads wont help you late game  it doesnt scale well sell that instead. You lose out by not having fast movement speed if you sell your boots. It hurts your ability to position yourself.While trying that spend all your effort learning to control Meepos comfortably and farm hardcore. Meepos biggest strength right now is his ability to comeback hardcore by finding farm anywhere and everywhere. Also calm down a bit when youre in team fights staggering your Poofs and nets allows you to have way more control over the enemy than ever.PS...holy wall of text sorry. I sincerely hope this offers some clarity to some of the problems you may be having playing Meepo.EDIT TLDR This loss came from mostly from difficulty and lack of comfort in playing Meepo it was not entirely the item build.,learndota2,clk41mi,3,t5_2tta4

2223596,0,t3_2kln0n,Not feeding and trying to keep your teammates from feeding is certainly the best answer but I appreciate that its not always in your control.gt Should I play Lifestealer?Sure  hes one of the most effective heroes against a fed Pudge. Hes also pretty bad against Huskar has no real way to kill him Ursa hook into ball off angry claws and Wraith King hooking him just means he respawns next to you and your ult is now on cooldown.gt Should I gank mid more often?This would be more useful against fragile mid carries like Sniper. Pudge snowballs off kills rather than gold and isnt especially vulnerable to ganks in the first place. Even if you kill him a bunch mid all it takes is for him to go roaming to the side lanes and he can be back in the game.Other things that you could try Play mid yourself. Not only can you make sure that Pudge doesnt get any kills against you mid but you can ping the hell out of his portrait when he goes missing so that your allies are less likely to feed him too. Failing all else just try to snowball yourself  its not as if Pudge is the only hero who can do it. Alternatively go knock on the mid tower whenever he leaves the lane. Ward. Dont just ward runs spots ward places where Pudge might hook from  cliffs the jungle and so on. People are less likely to get hooked if they know that Pudge is there.,learndota2,clmh0fo,3,t5_2tta4

2264739,0,t1_clrmx6y,I think youre on the right general lines  the theme I was going for was cores that are incredibly hard to lock down which means stuns and silences are order of the day.DP and Shadow Shaman are both great picks for exactly the reasons that you mention. SSs Shackles in particular are really good single target lockdown and should let you pick up kills on my offlane Weaver without him being able to simply Shukuchi out.Disruptor should work really well if you get his full combo off but Kinetic Field alone is pretty weak since all three of my cores have methods of escaping it if theyre not easily countered. I probably would have just gone for something like Lion for more reliable singletarget lockdown since youre currently relying quite heavily on your Shadow Shaman.BB should be able to survive my safelane with his easy methods of dispelling Silencer harass but I think your second choice of Doom would be more effective in the wider game  not for preventing the Global Silence so much as for the fact that my core heroes most especially Storm and Weaver are completely screwed over if they get doomed.

2291930,0,t3_2lgb2h,Another thing to consider is that while Slark is a superb hero that can snowball. Drafting him into a team proves to be quite difficult  rather your team needs some sort of plan.The problem with him is that he is not that strong a laner. Some can choose to throw him offlane in hopes of grabbing enough levels while not dying. Sure he has a pounce and death pact that can get him out of CCs. But lots of trilane even dual lanes can outright zone him out and burst him to death without much trouble at all. The HP cost associated with death pact can hurt him in some cases even. Many slarks are run midlane. But there are also many strong midlaners that will dominate the slark unless he is given lots of attention by the supports on his team. Conversely pretty easy to keep down if opposing supports decide to visit the slark. Lastly you can run him safelane but the tradeoff for that is youre obviously losing a true hardcarry and now must have drafted a team that relies heavily in winning by midgame and snowballing. Besides these conventional lanes even if you run slark solo safelane with aggro tri or something hes actually a pretty poor v hero against many other offlaners. What about  lanes? Certainly slark is pretty strong when paired with somebody else as nobody really wants to spend their CCs on slark but are somewhat forced to  again drafting around Slark is an issue.A thing to keep in mind is that balancing hardly means anything in lower MMR brackets and are meant primarily for fair exciting professional play. In that sense Slark I would have to add is pretty fun to snowball games with and will be OP in such games. Otherwise he has a niche role and is arguably manageable to playplay against.Hope this helped bring other factors into perspective ,learndota2,cluzypv,1,t5_2tta4

In my head it feels like all the champs are overpowered as hell but in a really good way. The game is more punishing I feel and makes you pay more for your mistakes so you pay more attention to everything. The actual gameplay is alot different. If I play mid I can push hard and force their mid to not gank. Or fake a gank which will make their mid move out of lane and then push down mid tower while they try to gank etc. So much I could say but honestly I cant find the fun in playing LoL anymore.

I can pop ult for the teamfight and then immediately pop ult to bring down an objective.  Basically once DP has a refresher it seems like the game is pretty much done its the nail on the coffin if you will.  Inexperienced teams might not focus the DP when she ults and even if they do the ghosts will regen you so if you can live through your first ult refresher just means youll be at full health when you pop the second.Also remember that the ghosts will go after your target if they can. so right clicking someone or a tower or rax will trigger a ghost swarm on that target. Helps to make sure your girls take objectives if theres a huge fight broiling around you.,learndota2,cly2ar8,5,t5_2tta4

2330454,0,t3_2m00lc,Pushing line ups are weak right now but you can still win with one early if you play them right. They arent easy to execute though. You need to find a balance between grouping up and pushing whilst pushing out other lanes and still maximising farm as much as possible. A good draft is key in achieving this and relies upon the enemy team having poor wave clear to an extent but the most important thing is that you need clear leadership. The leader must make decisions on when to push which everyone follows. Pushing strats dont succeed in solo matchmaking very often because people lack discipline and rarely play the right heroes to make a push strat work.Some common mistakes pushing line ups make Overestimating their strength  sure they tend to have a lot of gold but the enemy team will probably have more or equal xp to help compensate. In particular knowing when your team is ready to push uphill is key and takes a lot of experience to gauge. In general newer players tend to feel invincible when up by a lot of towers but this is where push strats so often fall apart. Certain heroes make pushing high ground exceptionally hard unless you are very well coordinated. Examples include big AOE ults such as AA and Magnus RP as well as spammy wave clear heroes like tinker. Keep in mind the enemies strength in defending when making the decision to push uphill. Accurately timing big ultimate cooldowns on the enemy team can be vital in executing a push strat against a competent team. eg RP is s Ravage sA hero that can siege from ranged preferably with an aegis can be crucial in breaking high ground. Dragon knight is a good example of a hero that does this well. Drafting pure push  you dont need five pushing heroes to execute a push strat. What you do need is good team fight. Heroes like tide viper and brew contribute little to the push itself but they make team fighting almost impossible for the enemy team. Drafting absolutely no wave clear on your cores. You need to pick mobile or survivable core heroes who can push side lanes quickly so that you can continue to push in good time. Brew razor and natures prophet are all very good at this.The best way to learn a push strat is probably to watch Vici Gaming at ti. This team was virtually unstoppable throughout the tournament because of their near flawless execution of push strategies. Their approach to pushing high ground was slow considered and their positioning was perfect.,learndota2,clzr9jn,2,t5_2tta4

2361946,0,t3_2mdvwt,Sorry man but that loss was all on you. I dont know what items you went for but clearly they didnt help you win your lane. True the support should have bought wards but if they didnt and you wanted to win your lane you should have gotten them yourself to block the pull.      Juggernaut and Lina also have no instant initiation so as long as you were positioned properly there should have been no way for them to jump on you. You died  times in  minutes meaning not only were you out of position  times but you didnt learn from your mistakes and kept dying That is definitely feeding and had I been that pudge I wouldnt have ganked either. Why would I gank the fed lane where there is a very underleveled offlane vs a fed carry and support? That gank is guarenteed to fail. Best for him to win midshort lane and once he has a comfortable lead get another support and then gank the juggernaut.  While that is happening you should have gone to jungle or gank midshort lane yourself.    Offlane heros have different goals but in general the main goal is dont die and get to level .

2377744,0,t3_2mm5ni,Its very difficult to gauge how a player can improve by only looking at their dotabuff as long as your item builds arent bad there isnt much to tell you. With that said however I did notice a lack of teleport scrolls on a lot of your endgame builds. A sign of a good player is always carrying a tp or  even if they are nearly  slotted. Another thing is your cs its a bit too low. Try to work on your last hitting and learn better farming patterns how and how find farm when the odds are against you.If you want a better idea of what to work on get someone to coach you or look at your replays.Another thing is making sure youre very familiar with most if not all the heroes. This includes knowing how to play them optimally. Look up first person replay commentary videos for this thats how I learned how to play a lot of heroes. Purge is fantastic for this. If you know the capabilities of each hero youll have a better understanding of when its a good time to chasegankrun awaystun heroes as well as leave them alone to farm. i.e. CM solo farming a lane?

2381373,0,t3_2mo6p8,When the ancient falls. As long as you have someone with some carry potential on your team andor decent teamfight ability you can come back from being three rax down though of course its extremely difficult and thus rare. You could make a graph of most games considering the gold and XP and when each hero peaks in the match to get an idea of breaking points at which one team or another is more likely to win but the advantage can always be lost through mistakes or just not capitalizing when you should have. Play cautiously if youre on the back foot every death for your team will put you further in the hole... but a single wellcoordinated smoke gank could swing the whole game.As for your match specifically the slardarundying combo is not particularly strong especially against most trilanes. A solo top slardar with you and tide supporting Undying bottom might have gone better if you could get kills though the general lack of ranged heroes on your team makes laning tricky. Omni though still a support is much more item dependent than others you need to get killsassists with him in this lineup or force tide into the hard support role. A different support might have been a better pick considering your teams greedy lineup  your team is also low on disable another aspect that Omni is unusually lacking in for a support.  ,learndota2,cm61nul,8,t5_2tta4

However you can use items during your ult so you can choose your targets to some extent by blinking to them between slashes.Edit I actually got that bit wrong  since slashes dont reset your attack there isnt a minimum attack speed required but more attack speed still means more attacks!

2494244,0,t1_cmjmugu,Oof. Well Im impressed that you have managed to do as well as you have. The  ping time is a huge problem for you. Since it is the roundtrip time for something to get from the server to you or viceversa you will definitely be issuing commands on things that are not there. I think this might explain why youve done so poorly with Rubick. Say you want to steal a spell. Well you click on the location of someone... but that was where they were about  of a second ago  milliseconds. By the time your command gets back to the server it will be another  of a second later. So there is very little chance unless they are channeling I guess that they will still be in the same spot. Instead you will then be running around after them wherever they have moved on to. This will probably affect just about every aspect of your game play. I wanted to suggest playing a carry but you need to be able to last hit which I cant see with your ping. I think maybe the jungle is the safest place for you until you can get your ping down. For example you do pretty well with enchantress  presumably in the jungle. You dont need reaction times as good there so I am guessing this is why. Good luck.,learndota2,cmk4wah,1,t5_2tta4

This is absolutely nuts. your EHP is suddenly  higher and for each point in HP you have you basically do guaranteed damage to people around you. This is why you can just have radiance  tank items and just walk into teamfight not attacking or anything and just the act of being near you when you get attacked finishes off weaker supports. This is also why BKB is mostly redundant on Spectre Youre gonna do silly amounts of damage even if youre stunlocked from beginning of the fight to the end of itSpectre has good strength gain but mostly Spectre becoming tanky is about building items that provide HP or Str. Vanguard is not really optimal for this purpose but it makes Spectre nearly ungankable while farming Radiance so unless your team can protect you until you have full Radiance finished you might have to go for some ugly items like that.Theres also Drums build which is more teamfight oriented since Drums doesnt really help you farming jungle like Vanguard does but speed aura can really help in teamfightsgetting kills.,learndota2,cmqox66,2,t5_2tta4

Batrider is a standout because he can use the movespeed either way because of his ultimate and he gets it typically to prepare to transition into the jungle anyway.Ranger offlaners such as Windranger Necrophos and Natures Prophet very commonly get Phase Boots because they can very safely go for some CS when the creep wave is somewhat close to their tower.

And theres a lot of example like that where people care too much about one thing and lose track of another one because of that.Dota is mostly about always caring more about the big picture rather than whatever detail is important in your opinion. Finding the good balance with your own resources and capacity is the key to become better and having a higher winrate there is no universal trick to manage things even though there is a lot of trick for every single mechanic that can make it easier to manage.A good way for you to improve would be to read a bit about all the things that take you too much timebrain power and try to understand it better so you can be more efficient ingame and think faster and better.,learndota2,cnpn9qw,1,t5_2tta4

There are so many variables in the game that aiming to improve mmr increasing your percentage win rate might do more harm than good in the long term and burn you out quickly. I would do a couple of things in your position. Play more random Dota queue for random draft of single draft pick a random hero that will fit in with the team and try to learn it on the fly. . Practice set heroes in All PickRanked. Go into the game with an aim in mind and than review the game to see what changes you can make to improve. For example Practice Tiny beat my average last hits in  mins and test this build order. You can only do so much to win a game but you are in full control of all your actions experiment in improve on little things as you play. . Leave Ranked alone unless youre a  man stack with a plan that number means nothing. What you want is experience and you can get a more balanced game with less stress outside ranked especially with the small sample size playing on the AU servers. . Make friends and stack. Try to make dota a fun experience play games insult the enemy team Monty Pythons style. As an AU player this is one of the few times I can offer my services. ,learndota2,cnqni6c,1,t5_2tta4

3002570,0,t3_2uk15t,Hey! It doesnt look like youve been doing that poorly lately youre just barely below a  win rate and your win rate has gone up about  in the last three months. In may not seem like much but thats the grind that is DotA   win rate. Your average GPM and XPM are both slowly rising which means youre getting better at farming patterns or at least last hitting in general. ampnbspNow that Ive given you a slight ego boost here is what I can see are some of the issues could improve on to potentially get better at DotA . First of all your most successful heroes are carries. KoTL ES CM and Enigma are pretty well the only supports I see anywhere near the top of your most successful heroes. Based on your last few games I can see with DotA buff it looks like you are randoming your hero and not picking it. However if thats not the case Id highly suggest randoming as that will give you a better understanding of every hero and the game itself. Randoming or not I think it would be beneficial for you to play supports more often so you can get a better grasp on playing the support role. That way when you random into something that isnt a support role youll know how to punish the opposing supports or youl better understand their train of thought in terms of when you may be vulnerable or when they may be ganking. ampnbspIve already seen someone else in here write You die to much which means you have bad positioning or something like that. Although that person isnt wrong what they told you is not always the best way to learn. This is especially true when you only have around  games under your belt. Instead of worrying about things like positioning and dying less you should be strengthening your core mechanics. Focusing more on last hitting farming patterns stacking and pulling lane harassment. Improving these few core mechanics will do far more for you than worrying about positioning or item decision. If you ever take the chance to watch some of Auis videos hell probably reference a few things.  The early game is incredibly important it will most likely determine a majority of your game. You can climb MMR by hitting things. What he means here is that you can get a lot better at DotA by just hitting creeps better. Its tough to lose when you are one or two items levels ahead of your opponent regardless of positioning or map awareness. Item decisions dont really matter until you hit something like .  k MMR. ampnbspIts tough to notice your improvement in DotA as Valve will try its best to keep you at around a  win rate. It takes a lot of playing to slowly grind your way up the ladder. But improving your core mechanics is almost certainly the best way to do so. Right now you are averaging around  last hits by ten minutes and about . denies. Try to add at least ten to both of those numbers. Its very simple to keep track of this as youll be able to see both numbers in real time during your game. Really push for those extra last hits and denies in your lane and check what you have by ten minutes. If youre starting to hit  last hits and  denies push for  last hits and    denies. Itll be the best way to notice improvement and to actually improve. Hopefully this helps but if you have any more questions or anything Id be happy to help.    ,learndota2,co97q5t,2,t5_2tta4
3020382,0,t3_2uri6m,I think pretty well anything is possible but if you want an actual breakdown of how this would work Ill try my best to critique it and provide my own build that has more potential. Please dont take this negatively as Im just doing some theory crafting the same as you mine is just far less Yolo. Feel free to interpret what ever build you see fit. ampnbspgt Early Game  x Null Talisman Power Treads Magic Wand Drums ? might be good for low movement speedampnbspThis would give her some good stats but there are a few issues here. First thing is that shell have some solid base damage but Treads drums still makes CM very slow. At best these items will give her average attack speed damage and move speed but nothing that would make her a viable mid. Aside from this getting the early Nulls and Drums mean that her Orchid is very delayed. Youll need an Orchid before the    minute mark if you want it to be effective after that it starts to fall off very quickly and I dont think CM has the burst damage potential to make Orchid useful. Compare her damage output to a QoP or a Clinkz and you can see the huge differences is damage. gtMidgame Orchid Dagon Blink Dagger optional Ghost ScepterampnbspThis is a thin razor your walking on if you make it to this point. CM is very squishy and these items just turn her into more of a glass cannon than anything else. They give her some fighting potential but not as much as you would hope. I think Dagon is pretty overrated on most heroes. The differences between Tinker and CM are his abilities to farm Dagon levels far faster as well as the ability to rearm Dagon making it far more effective. If CM isnt able to kill a hero or when they finally decide to get BKBs CM is essentially a sitting duck. If you are going to do this youll almost certainly need at least a Force Staff but potentially both a Force Staff and a Blink Dagger to get the most out of your positioning. ampnbspgtLate Game Scythe of Vyse Etheral Blade Shivas Guard Refresher Orb Boots of TravelampnbspThis stuff is all pretty irrelevant as there are two scenarios hereA Youve made it to the late game and you have enough farm for all of these items. Realistically if youve gotten to this point you could buy any item and still win the game because your team is so far ahead. B Youve made it to the late game and realized your a Crystal Maiden and provide essentially nothing to the late game. Youre sad you didnt end it by the Midgame and regret trying to make CM a Tinker when in fact you could have just played Tinker.ampnbspThis isnt to say its not possible to run a CM mid as I think it almost certainly is. However youll almost certainly get out lane by essentially any hero and youll have to push out the wave and dive into the jungle often to make it work. Youll just be looking to build her like a classic Crystal Maiden with a few differences. ampnbspIt would most likely benefit you to build your items like thisBrown boots gt Bottle gt Tranquils gt BlinkYoull need to roam around a ton as Crystal Maiden will never farm faster than most heroes even with her ability to jungle somewhat effectively. Its possible to switch out the Blink for a Forcestaff but CM is so damn slow youll almost certainly need the range and positioning blink awards you. Itll also scale better than Forcestaff as youll be moving into dealing most of your damage with her ultimate. Youll still be very squishy early on but if you play well youll have some solid DPS output as long as you have another hero or two ganking with you.ampnbspFrom here youll look to build into more of a vessel for your ultimate. Aghanims gt BKB gt ShivasIf you can Blink in BKB and pop Shivas with a follow up Freezing Field you should be capable of dealing a ton of damage. The changes to BKB mean that even late game if you dance around the fights and hold your ultimate until the right time youll have a huge impact. Because you got some solid levels mid went ganking early on and more farm than a CM would normally get you should have most of the items at relatively good timings meaning youll have a fantastic impact in the game. ampnbspA few notes here. If you have a fantastic start and really control Mid Lane Id recommend moving into Boots of Travel instead of Tranquils as it will really increase your ganking potential global presence and counter ganking options. If youve managed to farm all of these items up and still need more a Sheep Stick is your best option as Blink Hex is one of the most difficult things to deal with. Dont forget your situational items like Linkens over BKB or a Ghost Scepter when facing a lot of Physical damage. If there is a lot of early game fighting it may benefit you more to pick up items like Rod of Atos or a Heavens Halberd to still be useful in team fights while getting more HP at the same time. Hopefully you take this all with a grain of salt. Anything is possible in DotA and I encourage you to try whatever youd like. I just feel that the build I provided was more plausible and may net you less reports.  ,learndota2,cob266u,6,t5_2tta4

When I pick I try to do strength heroes like huskarpudgecentaurphoenixlegion nukers like zeusnyxlina or ganking agility heroes like broodmother  bounty. I usually ignore farming as my allies almost always take the lanes and creeps before I do and Im usually on the lookout for enemy heroes out of position or vulnerable.

3411108,0,t3_2z976x,Runes are the catalyst of early dota  so much so that the  runes were nerfed to bounties because of how strong they can be! They add a degree of randomness though I do use that word loosely to otherwise stale lanes. An invis mid gank can really change the direction of the game  which is why early game vision is so vital. Personally I dont place too much emphasis on rune controlling for the mid unless I happen to be at the rune spot at that moment. As a support Id rather a be stacking b harrassing or c ganking. For the most parts supports are too low level to make use of the strongest runes  so do ask if anyone else wants it first. One exception bounty runes  as a support Ill check if the mid is on their way and if not just take it.Haste  It gives you all the positioning in the world for a gank. Abuse the fact that you can get in kill then escape easily. Or you can guarantee getting the next runes.Invisibility   Ambush time! Not quite as useful as haste though as you cant dive towers or escape. Possibly the rune with the highest average impact though.Double Damage  Can improve ganking but youll have to rely on the lane to set up the kill first. Guarantees a won lane for its duration. Having a DD is the time to man up against the enemy laner! Also has the best visual.Regeneration  Simple. Be efficient  get some free harrass during the regen burst. Play a little bit more aggressively. Possibly the best rune to win the lane with albeit boring!.Illusion  If youre micro inclined use it to stack camps... Or bait. I cant count the times that Ive witness ults being blown on illusions. Although this is probably the most underwhelming rune. Play mind games with illusions especially on PudgeBounty  Free money! Finally  balance out the midlane with the rune. Force the wave into the enemy tower to get tower damage as well as the rune. If the wave is pushed into your tower its usually better to get that waves exp and gold than a rune. Now that there are two runes you might still have a chance to refill bottle... Finally finally  if you dont have a bottle as a mid its almost entirely useless to get a rune. Just enjoy the free midlane while the enemy gets it.,learndota2,cph3ave,2,t5_2tta4
3422813,0,t3_2zfaba,When tower diving always bring the proper scuba gear. Make sure youre faster than the enemy you are chasing click on them and compare their speed to yours. If youre slower the dive is way less likely to be successful without some sort of slow or stun.. Make sure there are creeps or some unit to take tower shots for you. The fewer shots you take the better your dive is.. Make sure you can take the tower hits in the worst case scenario. Example tier  towers deal  dps to heroes. If your hero has  hp and you pass under that tower for  seconds make sure you can live without that  hp you just gave away to tower dive. The damage is variable so it can be less and is also further reduced by armor so if you are a high armor hero with speed Spirit Breaker is the best example you are more likely to have very successful dives.,learndota2,cpifca8,5,t5_2tta4

3511175,0,t3_30hi9t,My favorite sentance about that is   If you complain about kill stealing then you dont farm well enough .There is absolutely nothing wrong with what you said you made the right decision. I actually prefer getting kills on supports most of the time for a very simple reason  it makes a bigger relative difference to get a kill for supports than for carries.Lets take an example  consider a Venge and a Slark on the same team. We will consider that Slark will have  I wanted to say  but it might be high considering your bracket and the hero last hits at the end of the game  for Venge. We will not consider gold lost upon death although Venge should lose a lot more than Slark in that regard. First situation  Venge gets  kills Slark gets . If a kill rounds out to give about  gold for the killer and  gold for the assist that means about  gold for Venge and  gold for Slark. Now lets count the total gold. If we say that  last hit is  gold junglelane creeps dont give the same value so you can not have an exact value for every game I just assume its  because its reasonable. Slark has got    gold from last hits. venge on the other hand got    gold from that.Total gold for both   for Venge  for Slark. Other scenario  Slark gets  kills Venge gets .By doing the same calculations we get  for Slark  for Venge.Now lets look at the relative difference Slark    .. Having all the  kills not just  makes a relative difference of less than .Venge    ..  difference !The results are a bit offset because I did not include tower gold rosh gold passive gold gain or kills where neither Venge nor Slark gets the kill. Still it goes to show that getting kills on supports is huge much more than getting kills on cores.,learndota2,cpshxjl,10,t5_2tta4

3581072,0,t3_31cpyq,It makes me sad.  The hero just has a lot of issues. Heres a thread from rtruedota that discusses this more in depth That said I dont think there are very many people experimenting with alch builds because the hero is so rarely played right now. If you want to play the hero I think the roamingsupport claniraq build is probably the only thing that still makes sense if youre being serious.Take everything below with a ton of salt since Im uh... not the highest skill player.I have a mid build that I like to go that I think is fun to play but it only works in situations where if you were being serious you would pick a VASTLY superior mid hero and have a much easierbetter time. I dont even think this is a good way to play alch I just happen to enjoy it a lot.The basic idea is to get a very fast armlet and a fast blink dagger and just go around fighting and ganking. Armlet gives you  HP  attack speed armor and  damage which basically covers all of Alchs early game needs. Coupled with your ult the  HP boost from the added str is sustainable with rage regen. Once you hit  and you have an armlet you should be fairly difficult to kill in the lane. Then you need a blink dagger so you can get on top of people since you do respectable right click damage with your ult up. The general playstyle of the build is to alternate between LOTS of fighting and flash farming whatever area of the map you are in when you arent. Armlet  spray  your ult is also a fairly potent farming combo.Skill build is   Lvl | Q | W | E | R | Stats | Notes  ||||||      |   | ?| ?|   |       | Skill stun if youre contesting rune      | ?| ?|  |   |       | You want  point in greed by level       | ?| ?|  |   |       | nd point in greed      |  |  |  |   |       | Value point in spray for wave push      |  |  |  |  |       | Take ult at six.      |  |  |  |  |       | Max stun by  since you need it to gank.     |  |  |  |  |       | Start putting points back in to spray.     |  |  |  |  |       | Max spray     |  |  |  |  |       | Max greed     |  |  |  |  |      |Think of these more like goalposts than hard guidelines. You should be pretty flexible with your skill build. For example is the game more passive? Take more points in greed in spray over concoction to leverage the passive nature of the game.Starting items Stout  Mandatory on alch. He gets forced out of lane too easily without it.  tango  Youre going to be harassed a lot since youre a noarmor hero. You need the regen. Ideally get an ally to pool you a tango or two as well. Quelling Blade  The QB is very important because Alch has to buy damage and early game QB is the cheapest way to out basedamage an enemy mid. Since we take  early points in greed the QB is an investment.Item timings are important here so I list them. These are ideal timings. They seem ambitious but its very doable. The reason is because of the scaling on greed  with two points you basically get  more out of each creep wave assuming you can CS like a boss. Usually I can only manage the tail end of these timing windows unless I get lucky and score a kill. If I can farm and I get a kill the earlier timing windows happen instead. Alch stun does a surprising amount of damage but not all mids are susceptible to getting crapped on with spraystun.Core items Bottle sub  minutes  You need this for rune controllane sustainbottle crowing. If you cant get it by  minutes bottle crow the first time around so youre topped off. Brown boots  minutesish  Honestly you can farm this by the time the chick gets back to base after your bottle. Armlet  minutes  This item synergizes really well with alch. It gives him a ton of damage that he needs a ton of HP when his ult is up. Basically every  seconds you are a very scary hero for the first  minutes of the game. I think theres a lot of room for finesse with Alch ult  armlet since he gets so much natural regen. With bottle you can swing your HP pool pretty massively if you can weave in and out of a fight. You can also toggle it on and off as you are going in for last hits for the bonus damage. If you get good at it it makes it pretty hard to contest your farm in terms of raw damage. Blink  minutes  You need this to gap close. Once you have your blink dagger you can cede the lane to someone else who needs it.Squeeze these in somewhere and adjust your item timings accordingly Phase bootsPMS  PMS has a ton of value for alch  attack speed  point of armor better damage block. Phase boots is good too since it is cheap extra damage and it synergizes pretty well with the movement speed on your ult. I havent tried it with treads since I never play the hero but I think treads is a fine choice too.You can shuffle around the item order of your early core of Blink  PMS  Bottle  Phase  Armlet  TP Scroll based on the needs of the game but ideally youll have armletblink by  minutes or so. Personally I think its best with rushing the armlet.Late core items Medallion  If you are behind or dont have enough space to occupy buy a medallion since it will significantly boost your burst damage from your nuke Assault Cuirass  If your roaming goes well buying this is preferable. It gives you minus armor to synergize with acid spray attack speed armor etc. If your ganks go well and youre able to suck up farm wherever you are you can get this fairly fast. BKB  You should probably get this on Alch. Its more HP and helps him ignore lockdown since by the time you farm it people will start grouping up for engagements. BasherAbyssal  BlinkAbyssal is a very strong combo and Abyssal gives Alch one last bit of damage boost. Skadi  You can replace your armlet with Skadi. I think it is an ok Alch item at the very end of the game.So the ideal slot looks like Blink | Abyssal | AC | Armlet | Travels | BKB . If you still need to expand you can dump the ArmletBlink but you should really be trying to choke the enemy team out of the map before you should ever consider getting rid of those two items. When I play this build its really easy to see the problems of alch as a hero. I have this window in the beginning of the game where Im actually pretty strong and at every other point Im fighting against his scaling to stay relevant to the game.Edit Heres a video of Purge executing a pretty similar build. So now you know what it looks like. He ends up farming more than I do because I prefer taking advantage of how ridiculous the stun is early on in the game. The only difference is I go armlet gt blink gt AC instead of AC gt blink gt Armlet. I also dont max spray first or get treads. If you want to get treads though its good for the IAS.,learndota2,cq0gyev,3,t5_2tta4

3649200,0,t1_cq7qojp,Of course but maybe Im thinking of different things you can utilize in these games that arent necessarily what pros do but maybe what theyd utilize in these games. For instance whenever I play Ursa I always Rosh before  minutes if I was in a higher level pub they could stop that but the other team isnt thinking about that in my ranking. Or heres also a great example when I played team captain mode with my buddies we played some people in a much higher skill group than us. When we spawned we all ran towards bot run to secure it but the other team went  man into our jungle and block almost every single camp with sentry wards and effectively I was shut down for  minutes before I realized what was going on and then they just ganked me. Things like that lower players can utilize if they know that the other team wont stop that or know what theyre doing.

What makes these heroes difficult to play are the mechanics involved. Cloning and micro with Naga shiftqueueing with Tinker invoking and combining with Invoker. Practice in private lobbies until you feel comfortable enough with the mechanical aspects of the hero you wish to learn. Finally you need to know how to lane with the hero. Get used to the attack animation so you can last hit well. Understand when to hold points in your nukes as Tinker and when to skill what you need to be able to secure cs as Invoker.,learndota2,cqbd3xs,3,t5_2tta4

3754965,0,t3_33ewn5,Dota is very situational.  Clinkz has his place but you need to remember his downsides he has massive mana problems he is purely single target based and has little to no teamfight presence he is extremely item dependent and he has a very hard time recovering from a poor start meaning that he needs to get ahead early and try to solo ganksnowball to stay relevant.  If your team already has strong teamfight presence and needs a ganker then hes a good choice.  Drow is a very strong hero but fits a different role.  She can put out extreme rightclick damage and gust is very useful as a survival tool as well as teamfight tool.  It has good range and width so if you time it well you can silence two or three heroes in a fight.  Mask of Madness is a great item on her.  If you get jumped on by Axe or TA and youre fast enough gust them for a  second stun pop your mask and run back from there either decide if you need to keep running or you just turn on your frost arrows and kill a hero thats silenced for  seconds drow is great at kiting enemy heroes as well.  I personally never build shadow blade on her for the money you can get more agility items and increase your DPS.  You also need to remember that her aura is percentagebased.  Lunar Blessing is great early but falls off quickly because its capped.  Drows aura can also impact creeps when activated get a nice creep wave and use it to push towers.  Additionally drows illusions also benefit from her passive so manta style is basically tailor made for her now and is great for pushing in addition to is defensive abilities.Theyre both good heroes theyre just different.  Drow is a great teamfighter can quickly recover from a bad start and be relevant late and is a great pusher.  Clinkz is an excellent ganker and snowball hero who can also push.  So you just need to pick the one thats right against the enemy team and compliments your team,learndota2,cqkakjq,7,t5_2tta4

Usually  is still during laning tp home fill up and grab a smoke. I like to go try to wrap around behind mid and drag the enemy mid over the river. When initating first pop firefly so you have flying vision Very important so you know if you are jumping only one person or if they have a friend with a stun or something. If it is safe blink on the enemyliterally on top of the target and lasso the target as soon as you lasso them get back to your team asap usually by force staff occasionally you can drop a napalm on them but dont spend time throwing napalm if you are not safely away from danger. After you initiate you have two options.. firefly is still up firefly around the area and throwing out napalms. avoid being right in the face of the carries but be a nuisance and spread out as much fire as you can.. firefly is lowdown spam the enemy team with napalm. if you can interrupt a channel or mess with their well planned positioning use flamebreak. Remember if fire fly is down you can use napalm to get some vision over trees or into rosh.

Youre team probably wont listen to you if you flame them for feeding the whole game but if you say its ok and suggest something to them afterward I find they are more likely to listen. It makes the game feel more fun for me instead of getting upset all the time about people throwing away my mmr. Its a learning experience for everyone each game and if you flame you really miss your own mistakes and dont improve.

Usually the build is yasha drums manta or blink desolator. In your game you should have gone blink deso and aimed to just burst down their gyro and drow.

3876019,0,t3_34u099,Skill build Back in the days where Gyrocopter was a top tier carry around  years ago flak cannon was maxed first. I think this is still primarily the best option. It speeds up your farm and allows you to take stacks very easily. However there is consideration for some variation. Rocket barrage is a great skill but it doesnt scale the best. It already does a ton of damage at level . So many people tend to leave it there for a while. However if there is a lot of early game action I think some extra levels in it early can be worthwhile especially now that it has no cast time.  I dont think you should ever max homing missle first as a carry. However a second level is pretty great since it doubles the damage and can lead to more kills in lane. Items Overall the hero has a lot of options.  Helm is your standard lifesteal item that can be used to stack ancients. Additionally it allows you to jungle without fear of getting damaged.  Drum is still a good option if you need to increase your health early.  BKB is a must many games because Gyro has low range he will often need to be closer to fights.  If youre left alone early and you dont need extra hp you can buy a yasha. Itll boost your farm a considerable amount. You can upgrade it into a manta if you need the dispel. However if you dont then getting a SnY is much better. I think the item is underappreciated on the hero and it can do a lot of work.  Ive seen a lot of people rush mkb on the hero. Dont fall for this. Mkb is a great item in the right situation but the fact is that the item usually sucks if youre not getting it to deal with evasion. Remember flak can miss due to evasion so the item can be a good purchase at times. But if you dont need it getting an item such as butterfly or daedalus will be better.  For lategame items butterfly daedalus and satanic are your bread and butter. Although daedalus only applies crits to the main target it still gives a hefty damage boost for secondary flak targets. Furthermore itll help you when youre fighting without flak. Remember divine is always an option if the game is going south. However I would not advise getting it unless you have satanic and bkb except in situations where you would always lose the game otherwise.Additional information In fights you just want to be close enough to hit everyone with flak. Then you just need to attack something. Doesnt need to be a hero. For this reason I usually just run into a fight and use the attack location command. This makes sure I attack the nearest target and will not get kited.  When youre farming in the jungle buy a quelling blade. Cut trees between the camps. Lead the camps together and then activate flak. Youll deal damage to many more creeps and farm significantly faster. You dont always need to use call down when a fight starts. You just want to use it when it is most inconvenient for the enemy team to try to dodge it. Its kind of difficult to give specific instructions for this but itll come with experience. ,learndota2,cqy3lgm,4,t5_2tta4

As a side note BKB doesnt stop his stuns or BasherAbyssal stuns.Silence prevents Rikis Smokescreen I think that stops channeled abilities. If he doesnt initiate with Smokescreen you can silence and run. Also hide inside Sprout Orchid and TP Silence so he cant Smoke you. With Nyx as long as you can survive his initial combo you can silence him and run he has no right click. You may want to invest in some HP items Sange etc. or a Linkens for mana burn but Im not sure how important that damage is in terms of killing you.Tinker can push all  lanes slowly but cant push any lane hard. Furion has a  second TP cooldown so he cant push out every lane like Tinker does but due to Treants and MaelstromDesoetc. Furion can push a single lane a lot harder than Tinker does and Furion can also actually do significant amounts of tower damage.Orchid stops Tinker from doing anything other than a mediocre right click.These heroes counter Furion effectively since their entire playstyle revolves around finding lone heroes and killing them and ratting puts you in that position  alone with no nearby towers for allies to TP to not that it matters since they have so much burst damage.,learndota2,cr8irsi,1,t5_2tta4

The problem we had was more that the offlane just killed everyone then. They dove killed the carry sometimes died themselves. But it was always pretty bad for us as at least the carry was sent back to base. When their mid was constantly shaking his balls in our jungle it was really tough to find farm there.

3995243,0,t1_crbogc6,Youve also gotta consider the buildup though. Getting a maelstrom is not only a useful item on Void but it really helps him farm a lot more quickly  Crystalys and Daedalus cant really compete in regards to the latter.Assuming you are getting these items in a timely manner then damage shouldnt be an issue since the MoM build is somewhat reliant on getting things done within Chrono and your bash is your main source of your damage even with a damage item like Daedalus. Also Moon Shard as an item in of itself kinda sucks  its really good as a way to spend your gold and improve your AS once youre  slotted but as a standalone item its kinda expensive and is very limited. If youre jonesing for attack speed then Butterfly situational and Mjolnir less so are the way to go since they are less one dimensional and the latter is a great farming item.Its a matter of preference and if youre having success with your choice of build its hardly right for me to suggest youre wrong.Also one last thing  Id suggest that if youre looking to play Void at least using the typical Mask of Madness build then its best you dont play as a position . Even with the nerfs to his mana pool and Chrono cooldown hes a decent Offlaner and the strength of Void playing as  role means that your team is not reliant on your damage and by extension  your chronosphere. Outside of it you are really squish and it only takes  or  competent pickers and players to hinder your ability to land and execute good chronospheres. As an offlaner Voids strength is that by hitting  quickly he can look to recoup on farm hes lost by not being in the safelane by creating kills around the map and with Mask of Madness and Maelstrom he can farm the jungle quickly and leave the lane to his position . Not to mention that by focusing on the jungle you are more likely to be out of enemy vision which is powerful in of itself since if the enemy doesnt know where you are they cant be sure you arent about to kill them short of cooldown knowledge and defensive warding.,learndota2,crbow0n,1,t5_2tta4

Yes that meant no one was in the offlane Rage out and give up or intentionally feedHowever very often I see the same players later in the same game making good teamfight decisions or ratting effectively even after throwing the early game. People are at their MMR for a reason and if they were any lower than you they would be stomping. And the key trick is that just as much dumb shit happens on the other team just as often you just dont see it. So the best solution is to let teammates do their dumb things and adjust your play. Dont sit aggressive in lane if your supports dumbly left you alone just to feed and then blame them.

4060161,0,t3_371o4o,Your draft wasnt that bad it was just that much harder to execute imho. You needed to push early as you had very little hope later in the game.A few general hints from what little I know. You dont want Doom on your team. Best case scenario is hell be sucking farm of the map and be useless worst case hell be feeding the enemy. Doom needs tons of farm to be relevant there are other heroes in the pool that can utilize that farm much better. If you wanted lockdown for Storm then Skywrath Disruptor Silencer or any orchid builder wouldve been much better choices. . Dont pick Venge unless you know exactly why you want her  like when you draft her because you need your Drow to hit that much harder or when you have a minusarmorRosh lineup etc. Shes a versatile hero and everything but in everyday pubs there are supports that are easier to execute and can have much higher impact. You couldve gotten CM and given BB the opportunity to spam Quill Spray you couldve gotten WD or Tide to punish the enemy every time they group up too much you couldve gotten WW to have CK kill the Storm etc.. I realize that CK was last pick here which is kind of a mean thing but hes one of those heroes that you need a very clear idea about how youll deal with him. You need to either prevent him from becoming big pick RikiSlark and gank him constantly kite him in fights with highmobility heroes like QoPPuck while someone like Sniper or even your BB deals damage from a distance or be able to kill him lategame pretty much only Medusa and Sven.,learndota2,crj3721,2,t5_2tta4

Midas on Alchemist is not that great in that case because levels dont give you too much unlike OD for example and you already have naturally high GPM so the relative difference is small. I would say if you want midas its because you are actually planning on fighting a lot because it will help you not being level starved.Another note against bloodseeker in particular always carry a TP. Thats a general rule but against bloodseeker its even more important. Take a TP in the first  minutes of the game before he gets .But I think there was no reason to flame you or anything. It looks like one of the typical cases of Report alch he is farming instead of suiciding with us. In that case mute report play your Agame and stall for the late game.

Then everyone is standing in the fountain the crystal maiden walks off and the courier sign hasnt come up. Uh oh shes forgotten to buy items lets click to check. Nope she has bought brown boots and is strolling towards the mid lane to auto attack creeps. Hence why I wait for the courier sign to come up before I buy any items. Having written that I can actually see that the courier is a very good representative of support play.

4097876,0,t3_37k4mn,Ill give a couple of pointers myself as a starting point but Im sure that people will comment here eventually. . Learn the money maker combo based on your Invoker build.a QW vokers have to nail the tornadoEMP combo timing as well as points in each QW to get the timing right b WE vokers need to farm the Euls as quickly as possible to pull off the meteorwave combo c QE vokers are a mix as they use cold snapsummonsicewall to initiate fights which are quite rare but thats based on what Ive seen over the  years Ive played. They usually get blink dagger first. Assuming youve practiced and mastered your moneymaker combo the decision between the  builds above depends on what your team needs. a Usually QW builds are the most common because they allow you to initiate from far TornadoCold Snap and theyre incredibly useful in fights EMP as long as you get it right. The added bonus is that you have an escape too Ghost Walk natural tankspeed from leveling QW. b WE vokers are probably the most farm oriented ones and they wont be popular I can tell you that. Unless you have a roaming squad or youre just THAT far ahead in your laning stage WE vokers to me are more flair the risk of being ganked etc is just not worthy of the extra intdamage. Of course you can always attempt a sun strike here or there but that really doesnt make you THAT useful especially if youre in mid.c QE vokers are very rare nowadays because I rarely see blink dagger invokers anymore. Still this build gives you health regen and damage in the laning stages and this build is situational. If you have a roaming support with nuke damage you could easily do a cold snapsummon combo to gain an advantage before level . A team lacking push would really benefit from Invoker as Ice Wall is also a decent counterinitiating skill. As for midlate game... Usually youd expect a core item by now or  and that comes down to what synergizes with your moneymaker combo. At level  youre expected to have a point or two in your third skill so your skill set should expand to  spells a fight. So with item choice youd usually first think of the spell you invoke after the money maker combo. If youre initiating with a TornadoEMP and you want the team to follow up into fights Drums would help the team and you can eventually build into a force staff. If youre on a greedy WE build after Euls youd pick an item that will last you in fights such as a Hex or a BKB. For QE vokers everyone will have their own opinion and my personal favourite is transitioning into the rest of the spells quickly with Aghanims but thats my scrub build Good luck and PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE. ,learndota2,crndtdk,5,t5_2tta4

4178726,0,t3_38oj4q,Ive played a bunch of bristle at the k tier. I usually go Basi shield boots then vanguardtreads depending on what I need first attack speed or regensustain.Recently Ive begun breaking down the Basi to build a medallion as another midgame item. This depends on my team comp but its super useful  even if I cant get into a fight in time e.g. slow rotation I can throw out medallion on teammate or enemy so I can contribute to the fight. Ive preferred it to a wand but I will go stick early game if up against a spell spammer. Depends on how fast the laning phase is moving along.After that I think about a what item the team needs most usually between pipe or AC but sometimes skull basher or bkb. I agree that AC and BKB would have been your best options here. I find that blademail doesnt give me enough protection takes up an item slot late game and keeps the enemy from focusing me which is really the goal of any bristle back player. Id rather just pick up a medallion and early platemail for tank a utility build. You took k dmg from Sniper  more than his next to common targets combined. That just screams the need for more armor. Octarine core is great fun on bb but very expensive and doesnt really help the team. If you are spending most fights running away shooting out spines go this route. If youre doing more kiting followed by turning and bashing consider picking up vlads  other team utility. Vlads is cheap in terms of gold but expensive in terms of item slots. I havent watched the replay just looked over YASP but I would have thought you could have done more tower damage early on. That tower gold might have helped push your team advantage and get WD Techies and Void online earlier. Also looks like techies was having a hard early game.  min arcanes... goal is to have those by  min. Some folks try to play techies as support. He is not a good support but a fantastic core that brings a ton of utility to the team.  is not good. Your team needed another support like venomancer or crystal maiden. Just some thoughts from a k scrub. Id love some feedback from OP and other commenters on my analysis  trying to get better at this skill as well. ,learndota2,crwkvrz,1,t5_2tta4

My mentality behind the BoTs was to split push using my Silver Edge but the game ended too quickly. I also never really considered changing to a supporting role because the other carries in my team were having a worse game then I was.

4203554,0,t3_38xwph,Centaur is currently my highest winrate hero at least among the ones with  games. There are only two big items that I consider core on him Blink and Heart of Tarrasque. Blink makes him the initiator hes supposed to be and its my first pickup almost every game. Heart is a perfect Centaur item that makes him very tanky for teamfights significantly boosts Return damage and allows him to Double Edge at will. Everything else is situational. I get Heart after Blink whenever I have the chance though big fights happen so early this patch that there are often higher impact items to pick up along the way.I went through an experimental phase where I built MaelstromMjolnir a fair bit. The logic was that it improved Centaurs abysmal attack speed made him more of a threat in teamfights and allowed him to farm up other bigger items faster.I largely stopped building it after realizing that Centaur doesnt really need this item. PostHeart the effect on farm speed is negligible because creep waves and jungle camps already explode to Return and Double Edge. Seriously Centaurs farming GPM is ridiculous with a HoT. PreHeart... it just delays your Heart. Very little of the buildup is individually useful on him and there are usually teamfight items youd want to prioritize instead like a Pipe or Aghanims.Pretty much everything for which you would want to build a Mjolniraccelerated farm faster attack speed and more teamfight presenceis much better accomplished on Centaur with an Assault Cuirass.Lategame its not a bad idea to build up Centaurs right click and there are still a handful of situations where Id consider building one but it would usually be  as one of my last items. For instance those extreme lategame sieges where youre stuck holding the base against megaspainfully common in . but thankfully pretty rare this patch.Battle Fury is pretty useless on Centaur. He doesnt make very good use of the mana regen or the cleave since he farms primarily with Return and Double Edge and there are much much better sources of damage and health regen.,learndota2,crze94u,1,t5_2tta4

4222223,0,t1_cs1hrz1,I see . One tried and true way to improve your gameplay is to analyze your own replays particulary from your enemies perspective . Some of the questions you can make to assess how good was your support during the whole game is Was the enemy solo offlaner harassed? Was heshe able to recover its farm after getting harassed?How? How it was the rune control of your team? Did you make an deliberate effort to replace wards that was about to expire? During that interval when wards expired and when you start replacing them did the enemy team attempted to gank start teamfights or seize control of one of your towers? What was the outcome? When they were setting up ganks could you see it coming? When you were setting up ganks on them did you let slip a warning for them? For example when their creeps were close enough of one your towers and no one approached to switch the lanes equilibrium .  When you died did the enemy team had a superior positioning or vision? When your team needed a gem did you make an effort to buy it? If so did you carry the gem yourself or pass it on to someone else? Why?After you have answered most of your questions youll be able to see for example if there wasnt a better hero you could pick for your team . ,learndota2,cs1ihv5,2,t5_2tta4

4238627,0,t3_39h2dq,I am a massive scrub so take everything I say with a proverbial grain of salt but BS is my most played and most successful hero and I mainly run him mid. His big thing is buying QB at the start Bloodraging for lasthits and denying the opponent as much CS as possible. With those two things on him BS hits creeps obscenely hard something like at least a fifth of a creeps HP bar in one swingno one is outlasthitting you unless they have hardcore kill potential. In a harder lane its probably sensible to Bloodrage creeps and not yourself but you get more regen if you cast it on you so theres a dilemma you have to solve by yourself.  His Bloodrite is a very good zoning tool so if a ranged hero is giving you shit just cast it and lasthit away.   He has good synergy with some other heroes too. Global strats have been nerfed but he still receives the damage and MS buffs from the global heroes doing their thing. Also Necro every second he stays near enemies BS gets strongerhe can Bloodrage the target of Necros ult to give him a big chunk of healing instantly. I havent tried it yet but Ive heard hes a pretty legit suppport. Having a lot of free damage eary a great damage amp an AoE silence and Rupture for screwing with positioning big time.

4253860,0,t3_39ogrp,Okay i just took a very quick look on your replay and there was a few things i noticed.During your laning phase vs leshrac you use your mirror image quite a bit but dont really achieve anything with it except for wasting your mana. Leshrac isnt a hero youd want to use this spell against early as he can clear your illusions so easily rather save your mana for rip tide to get some proper harrasment in.Generally your lasthitting is pretty poor as well. At the  minute mark you have a  CS which is very bad especially on naga who can spam riptide to farm. Your micro is nonexistent until you get your radiance. You run around with your illus in a pack and dont utilize them properly.What i do during laning stage on naga is that i pop illus at around  and put  illu at hard camp  at medium and  at rune location. I then proceed to stack the medium and hard camp with the illus simultaneously while still farming mid with my hero. With the illu at the rune i can see whether the enemy tries to contest the rune or not so i know if i should start bottle crowing which i dont rly see you doing and is quite key on naga.I also see you buying a ring of aquila which i think is a bit questionable. You have a CM on your team for mana regen and Naga Sirens base armor is very high so it seems like a waste of gold to me and delays your radiance i also dont agree on the quelling blade as you will mainly be farming with riptide anyway and naga has a quite nice attack animation.Basically the main problem this game is that youre farming very inefficiently which results in a late radiance around  min? where i usually get mine between  min mark.After you get your radiance you start splitting your illus a bit more up but still not efficiently. You send all of them in the jungle instead of sending  illus to different lanes as well. And after your illus cleared their camps they are just standing afk there mby even blocking the next spawn.After you get your radiance you should spam your illus everytime they are off CD i however see a lot of time where you dont do this. I see the enemy team grouping up several times leaving  lane open to push but you dont do this despite how underfarmed you are big flaw.Itemwise i agree with most of your item choices i do however not understand why youd get the octarine core before the th slot. You could easily have bought a HoT or a butterfly which wouldve made your illus a lot more tanky and made you able to stall for longer.I did not watch into the lategame but i assume you did not creepskip with your iluus. What you should do when they push lategame is that you should send an illu to cut off their creepwave so they cannot push HG.Hope this helped a bit.I am playing a lot of naga in the current meta and im gonna be making a guide to play her on my newmade website within the next week.

Were they  on  minutes and  on  minutes? Are there any intermittent milestones?. Was the priority during laning phase Farm then Deny then Harass?. I felt that I chased the nd rune too much. Definitely agree with you there. Will keep that in mind next time. I forgot your comment on the  or  per minute bit.... Assuming there wasnt a Raijin say he was an SF if I went BottlePhase Boots into blink into Aghas would you call it more suitable?. For arguments sake could you work out how many hits I would need to do more damage with a  build instead of a ?. Sorry for so many questions!.  Would you recommend I ask for a sent ward to be put on the rune spot before I used Smoke? On the part earlier where I made a risky smoke usage. I noticed that I had extremely poor vision of the map throughout the course of the game. My brother was the Elder Titan playing right beside me would you have recommended him do offensive warding or defensive?. Did we need a Mek carrier in this game? Could my brother have built Euls instead?I think thats it for now Ill try a few more Lina games ESPECIALLY with the Rod of Atos build. I cant wait to try it.

4296264,0,t3_3a5u0w,I was there not all that long ago so I think I have a unique perspective on this.The first thing you need to realize is that the enemy team is as bad as your team. Matchmaking didnt put all the idiots on your team and the skilled cooperative players on the enemy team. Change that mindset ASAP.Personally I got out by focusing on a few heroes TA Storm Tinker and Naga. All heroes that Im comfortable with can go mid and can carry a game easily even if the rest of your team gets behind.At .k your mid lane is your safe lane. Supports if they exist dont gank mid at .k they stand in lane and sap XP and possibly fight for cs. You are much safer and dont have to fight for cs in mid. If you cant go mid dont fight over it go to the lane with the hero with the worst attack animation on your team. Youll be fighting for cs and even though if youre better than your MMR you will be much better at last hitting than .k players you might as well not make it harder for yourself. The exception is if youre on a hero that can rotate to the jungle fairly early then you want safelane if you cant get mid.Even if youre a farming hero carry a TP from an early start. .k players will do something really dumb involving tower diving at some point in the early game. They also never expect TP rotations. You can get a kill  times out of  if you just watch the minimap closely in the early game and have a TP scroll pretty much regardless of what hero you are. Yes Ive counterganked with Naga. Youll get more or less the same amount of gold you would have if you kept farming but by getting a kill you also set them back so the relative net worth difference is greater.Focus on farming. I had a  winrate in all my games of .c and the majority of those were me afk farming. Its dropped a lot in . partly because Ive climbed MMR and partly because afk farming got nerfed BibleThumpIf youre mid against Pudge which happens a lot buy yourself a ward and put it on their mid high ground. You will beat Pudge mid if he doesnt hook you. Its easy to snowball when facing a mid Pudge unless you allow yourself to get hooked. Often youll be winning mid easily then night rolls around the creeps are pushed on your high ground and you get randomly hooked from a weird angle and all your hard work bullying Pudge is lost. A ward on their mid high ground will prevent this.On snowballing mids you have  jobs in addition to getting simply winning mid. You want to stack a camp for yourself when you go for a rune and you want to gank a side lane when you get a good rune. TA in particular can easily outfarm everyone by stacking ancients when she goes for a rune. On Storm you can stack your closest medium camp on Tinker you can stack your hard and medium camps at the same time with march. On Naga you can stack several camps with illusions.Why is stacking for yourself important? Because the key to snowballing is hitting your key item timings not necessarily on getting early kills. Maybe you have  kills on Storm but if you only have  cs at  minutes you are not nearly as ahead as you might think. Stacking for yourself helps you hit those item timings because you will miss out on a bit of farm when you gank the side lanes.So why do you gank the side lanes? To win the other lanes for your teammates. The only way you can lose if youre snowballing hard as StormTA is if your other lanes lose really hard. Everyones mechanics suck so winning lanes is more or less down to hero picks. Dont let it only come down to only that. Yes in an ideal world youd farm mid for your core items but sometimes you have to suck it up and gank if you have a good rune.,learndota2,cs9wtts,1,t5_2tta4
4299336,0,t1_csa8fl5,Because advantagesdisadvantages in mid snowball if you have to be passive for a creep wave the enemy will deny every creep and now youre also a level behind and now he has more damage than you and another spell so if you try to take CS hell almost kill you and then he denies more creeps and then you lose. In the safe lane if you get your salve later all you miss are some creeps of course you lose XP but youre going to be mainly farming and giving the offlaner an extra creep wave of last hits and XP usually isnt extremely bad and wont result in you getting destroyed like what could happen in mid.,learndota2,csa9c7l,4,t5_2tta4

4333335,0,t3_3amrng,I did not understand Puppeys itemization on Dazzle in the game they lost. I think he really needed a Linkens Sphere this game to put onto RTZ and Rod of Atos was completely useless. Overall I also think his KotL play in game  was a bit wonky e.g. mistimings on Illuminate Blinding Light skilling Mana Leak too late imo also. Fortunately none of the moments where he played wrong were really key engagements e.g. one time a jump on Shadow Fiend by  heroes then Puppey was impatient with Blinding Light so Sumail could hit a full ultimate on the three of them rather than being pushed into a suboptimal position.

4344447,0,t3_3arr02,Thats not how backdoor protection works. Every building has back door protection and it just prevents you from chipping away at the building when there is no allied creeps around creeps spawned from base. Buildings with backdoor protection will always heal up when under the effect BUT it heals up to what it was damage to previously when not under the effect.The only reason I can see that barracks healing up is either you attack the melee barracks and that has built in healing or the enemy had a Treant Protector. Those are the only  reasons for it healing not because backdoor protection healed it back up.If you need to know T towers has NO backdoor protection T  and  do have backdoor protection. Melee Barracks and Throne both have built in healing so they heal over time as well they have backdoor protection. Range Barracks only has backdoor protection.,learndota2,csfcmjl,8,t5_2tta4
4345907,0,t3_3as2ws,Id say Shadow Demon.Disruption is super flexible ability that helps your teammates set up hardtoland ability holds enemy in place for . seconds saves an ally from incoming danger lets you dodge projectiles and list goes on. Illusions it creates are crazy strong and people in my games often understimate them. With some micro you can juke enemies into chasing illusion and escape. So nice ability.But thats not all. You also have Soul Catcher  probably the best damage amplifier in game only Natural Order can compete but theyre completely different. Enemies rarely expect to be blown up by few subpar nukes well thats  damage increase for you. It basically turns Mist Coil into level  Laguna Blade. Besides it feels extremely rewarding to carefully manage cast area and correctly land it on enemy who stands in between creeps. Combo with Disruption for better results.Shadow Poison deserves honorable mention. Its super fun to go in lane and spam it on enemy. Suddenly they have  stacks of Posion on them and about to take fifth and die. Max it out and disregard teammates and first two abilities now you only need around  seconds to make easy kill on almost anyone except for Faceless Voiid sometimes.... But while its fun to spread ebola everywhere Id only do it in ARDM match going  is far better strategy. Mostly Shadow Poison will be used to scout out certain narrow pathway or prevent enemy from juking to clear creep waves in few button clicks  stacks will kill creeps at almost any stage of the game  deal with super creeps and to spam in teamfight. Sometimes you may accidently stack a nice amount of poison on their carry and then he suddenly takes over thousand damage from nowhere. Rarely happens but its hilarious when it does.And last but not least Demonic Purge. Literally best slow in the game. It goes through any type of magic immunity it purges everything you can wish for Sorry to all Omniknight players out there and with Aghanim you can use you THREE times in a single teamfight and it will also apply Break e. g. disable passives. Ulting Ursa or Lifestealer who just used BKB or Rage but now can barely move and watch them helplessly wander around teamfight is one of the best feelings in this game. But that may only be me because I am generally fond of delivering as much suffering as possible to my enemies in my games. ,learndota2,csfikt4,7,t5_2tta4

4348547,0,t3_3atime,If youre fast enough you can pull of the following combo X marks the spot Torrent onto X Then.. wait for a moment then Call boat form behind if you are too close it will not hit the enemy but land behind them keep that in mind Recall immediately before the torrent hits the boat is already coming at that pointIf you did it right the enemy will be lifted up and then as he comes down crushed by the boat. This can also work if you put the boat behind him because he will likely run away from you  that is assuming that he has not seen the boat yet and is not looking for any trouble.After the successful combo let your team initiate and hit them from being with your tidebringer.Another great combo is using X on yourself then TPing home and refilling your bottle. That way for  mana you are able to restore most of your HP and mana and only spend  for a TP. Keep this in mind Your E is not only a ganktool.

So some examples would be this came from another thread earlierLots of stuns  Buy a BKBLots of right click damage  Get a ButterflyLots of silencesdebuffs  Get a MantaAll of these items make you more survivable in different ways. On top of that consider DPS and attack speed. Void needs attack speed to get bashes off but also wants DPS to get SUPER crits. A DaedelusMKB situational and maelstromacmoonshard a combination of these things works well. A carry like Luna benefits from flash farming with her glaives so a HoTD early game to stack camps helps with sustain while farming and gets big ancient stacks for future. Also builds into Satanic later to help her fragile glass cannon ass and is like an Aegis. I am still learning itemization myself.

4364636,0,t3_3b0afr,First of all I recommend using a premade build extremely helpful.Im not really sure of the skill build for her but Ill give it a shot.I think usually you would skill your E first to give bonus damage to the entire team and then go for   point in Q  in W  in E and in level six  in ult.From there you can get that final point in your E and max silence and then max your Q. Make sure that at the beginning of the game you save a skill point to see if you need to use your Q to slow someone down. As far as item build goes you want to go for the normal agility carry build. Boots gt Aquilla gt Treads gt Some form of lifesteal Mask of Madness or Helm of the Dominator preferably the latter so you can upgrade to satanic gt Shadow Blade gt Yasha gt Manta Style OR Sange and Yasha It depends on your needs if you want to purge something off of you and need some extra tankability then Manta is the go to choice and if you need more damage and extra slow then go for Sange and Yasha. Do note that you can later disassemble Sange and Yasha to build both a Manta Style and a Silvers Edge which is why SnY is usually better gt Butterfly gt Satanic.,learndota2,cshmnxc,1,t5_2tta4

Two players TP in against  can usually hold position.  TPs vs  is overwhelming. Think about your teams initiation and counter initiation. Some teams are better for vN fights than others.

4405287,0,t3_3bhjww,You should get a manta at some point with yasha usually right after travels. Manta lets you split push more aggressively due to extra illusions and being able to dispel silences so you can song to escape. You should also get an octarine core usually after mantaradiancetravels. Sometimes before manta because its a better farming tool than the full manta is.Could you have prevented the early rax mid by cutting waves so they wouldnt have any creeps to turn off backdoor protection?Id also advise against more than one point in net early the extra second usually wont make a difference and points in stats are really good on the hero.I wouldnt buy crits on naga as theres usually more useful items to buy. Heart is okay but not required every game as octarine gives you some tankiness if you REALLY need the strength for illusions for whatever reason then get it but otherwise its totally fine to skip.When theyre pushing your T mid instead of sitting there doing nothing and then trying to get the tower deny you should have been pushing out a sidelane ready to TP if they threaten rax.Outside of a couple of silly deaths you played mostly fine you should put more emphasis on sending illusions to push lanes instead of sending three at a team fight. Remember when you just have radiance one illusion is pretty much just as annoying as  the riptide and radiance damages dont stack so you can have a similar contribution to the fight while farming in  other places.Mostly Id say your build can be improved.bottle gt aquila gt brown boots gt radiance gt travels gt yasha gt mantaoctarine gt the other is the core that you should do every game.

4406466,0,t3_3bi4sw,Better mechanics  tactics trump all the strategic work youve been doing. Positioning in lane trading harass effectively ganking well never missing last hits choosing the correct targets at the right times in fights. And equally importantly taking all those mechanical factors and noticing enemy shortcomings then taking advantage.Fixating on larger scale strategic stuff is a good way to get stuck in Dota. You will notice people doing stupid shit i.e. skilling wrong itemizing wrong forgetting that ancients exist etc and it will take all your attention when you could be analyzing mechanics and why fights went the way they did. The fact is for lower MMR games the game is more and more determined by individual engagements and outplays. You could take a stronger player and hand them your underfarmed stupid skill build carry hero at any point in the game and they will still dominate the game through mechanics. As you go up the MMR spectrum and people have more sound mechanics then the game becomes more and more strategic until top level players will see an enemy not take the right skill at level  and proceed to shit on them in lane by abusing that ineffeciency.If you want to keep playing support a fun exercise is to play a few games doing all the trashy pub support stuff and still try to win. So dont pull dont stack dont ward take some CS but not all of it and instead just try to dominate their offlaner or go around the map setting up as many kills as possible. You will then be forced to focus on positioning trading hits ganking and executing in team fights and it will actually make you a better player.

He can harass extremely well and can trade hits afterward due to the reduction and dragons blood. I find that I can win most match ups except against Shadow Fiend god I hate that hero since he just constantly razes creep waves.DKs item build is fairly simple. I just do the following build.QB  Pooled Tanges  Bottle  Boots  Wand  Treads  DrumMidas  BKBSB  Vlads  Mjollnir  DaedalusSilver Edge  SkadiSatanic. I really like Vlads on DK ever since it got ranged lifesteal. It fits the way I play him just standing in the middle of the fight dealing out loads of damage. It also benefits your teammates a ton because of the lifesteal and the armor. Speaking of armor I really dont like AC on him because the armor it gives is really overkill and if you need attack speed get Maelstrom into Mjollnir it fits him way better. Mjollnir gt AC is just my opinion though feel free to do whatever you want.Skill build is pretty simple for him. I typically just do something like this There really isnt much to explain about it its pretty straightforward.What you should do mid is apply constant pressure. Use Breathe Fire when a creep or two are low and make sure you hit the enemy mid in the process. If you manage to kill them or they dare leave mid lane just take their tower. After you take tower you can easily farm jungle or gank other lanes until your ulti is up again. Whenever your ulti is up you can just rinse and repeat until your team is leading with some ridiculous gold advantage because of all of the enemies nonexistent towers.,learndota2,csmsdxu,1,t5_2tta4

4421109,0,t1_csny6qh,I understand your points. Mine are that if AM gets ganked which is reasonable as hes the position  what will help you survive better stats or being able to burn the mana and deal a bit extra damage to the people ganking you? Spell Shield is a nice value point but it only mitigates magical damage.  AMs EHP is fine with a point against mag nukes and his starting str is good for an AGI hero but he quickly finds himself falling behind because his str gain is to be blunt complete garbage at . the lowest of any AGI in the game and tied for second lowest of ALL heroes. That means that by by the time level  or so rolls around competent gankers that can chase your blink are looking to make your life miserable. I dont understand why this matters yes  stats to any are nice  more are also nice. I understand low base attack time means more attacks I think  points in stats is more efficient at clearing than  additional ranks in mana burn and heres whyWe will ignore the bonuses to manaregen and health for the sake of this. Your  damage from  extra points in mana break vs. taking stats extra points into break is  more than rank  in damage minus  for stat damage is strong but not every jungle mob has mana and for many you will reduce them to  before you kill them. Once they have  mana you are no longer doing  bonus damage.  points into stats will always grant you  bonus damage  attack speed and . armor will arguably make laning phase safer before you transition into flash farming. Additionally unless you opted to purchase a Vlads before BFury you cannot fully sustain flash farming jungle the bonus to armor makes the regen from BFury more efficient and the bonus to health allows you to stay active on the map for longer.,learndota2,csnzsn8,1,t5_2tta4

Obviously a lot of that gold will be from farming so unreliable but maybe game circumstances change and you need to buy something else in between. Maybe there is a chance to do a good push and he wants a Desolator or something who knows. . Saving gold for buyback. Even in earlyishmid game buy back can be important if a situation presents itself. Good players want to hold onto their gold so that they have that as an option. . Hiding the item from the enemy. By not carrying any components of a BKB in his inventory the enemy now doesnt know he will have a BKB until he HAS IT and then USES it in a team fight. Maybe they dont expect it they win a fight and take Rosh maybe even a tower after ect. which swings the game. Dont forget good players can do more with less so having that  str from Ogre Club may not be much of a big deal for him. ,learndota2,cswb72y,50,t5_2tta4

In team fights the more common thing to see is her paired up with a true initiator like Tidehunter or see her blink in and use her ult AFTER the fighting has started and the enemy is committed. As someone whos pretty constantly played support it depends on your tier. If youre in a tier where people dont buy dust or sentries glimmer cape is great. Beyond that though blink is key. Blink also lets you get around the map faster lets you farm faster jump into teamfights better preemptively escape etc. You can do some work with a blink dagger on CM.

Why not pick a support when your team already got a carry ? Even if you hate playing support get jungler like bs doom and start ganking and creating space for carry when you reach level six. As for midlaner if your team support refuse to buy ward at the start of the game get one for runes control and even avoiding gank.

4820534,0,t3_3gw7bc,Take some time off ranked MM if you want to really improve your skills by throwing yourself to the wolves Captains Mode would be a better place. Alternately look into Random Draft or Single Draft as you can get out of your comfort zone while still retaining some options.As opposed to your microless stance try easier micro heroes like Warlock Shadow Shaman Venomancer or Enigma. Warlocks golems are great to working on micro as they are beefy do some damage and if they die its not TERRIBLE but kind of a waste. Veno is a bit easier in that it doesnt matter if they die but you can practice switching between hero and micro unit. SS is good to practice micro because the wards are usually ignored in a fight and you can attack low heroes that arent expecting the micro. Im bad at Enigma but people recommend micro practice specifically jungling with himit.One way I think Ive forced myself to improve is by commiting that I will not die  or more times in a match. If you are getting close to the  death mark and it seems like your team is falling behind try to start being more cautious when enemies are missing from the minimap. Get in the habit of Altclicking an enemy heros portrait when they are gone from your lane for  seconds. If you have the money buy a casual ward and just put it around or near a rune spot or in the jungle somewheretry not to block your own camps.

4839518,0,t3_3h5y6h,Hey man Im only k but I play a lot of storm Ill watch it real quick and jot down a few notes and update this in a bit if you want.I dont really like the null tally only starting build. I usually go Tango branchesmantle and if its a lane I think Ill lose I might get the tally.You were barely beating pudge in the CS and when you went back to base to get your bottle that allowed him to catch up to you in CS. Instead you should have just stayed and harassed him while the courier brought the bottle out.Also you should always try and push the lane out every  minutes so you can check the rune. Like at  minutes you could have gotten that regen and probably used that to get another kill on pudge when you got your ult.There are some more things I could probably nit pick all day like the orchid before treadssoulring but that stuff doesnt really matter in the long run I think.The only main thing I would stress about your item build is you bought an orchid first. When you buy the orchid you have to look at who on the other team you can easily blow up and get away and what spells would I want to stop. The only person that fits that criteria is maybe juggernaut. Also I would have either finished that linkens or bought a bkb since literally everyone of their spells except for hook were single target or magic based spells.  of the really big things I kept noticing is you kept going back to base for some reason. You would have  hp and  mana with full bottle and soul ring and go back to base for regen. You want to go back to base as little as possible because instead of walking to and from base you could be farming or making objective plays. Also you were being extremely inefficient with your mana. It wasnt uncommon for you to use  of your mana to farm one creep wave. So when the enemies jumped on you you couldnt just roll away.But in spire of all that the only reason you didnt win this game is BKBs and farming. It was  minutes and no one on your team had more than  or  items. And if even  of you had bought a bkb you would have actually just won the game when you were pushing their ancient at the end.Also your necro built dagon and aghs.,learndota2,cu4k5ch,1,t5_2tta4

4855500,0,t1_cu6huzs,Ill use riki as a example of what a roamer does as I know him the best from playing alot of riki roamer just because he was fun before bounty became meta so I feel I can offer a bit of advice in this. Riki roamer is kind of a  support in the sense you wont be taking any farm but youll also be greedy and wont be helping out the support much. Best doing this is a  as you said but for the first  levels you may be camp the offlane as long as they are fine with it. While doing this you goal is no longer to get kills. Usually this will take about  minutes into the game. At the  go to the rune  whichever is closest to you. Either secure it for your mid or if your mid is going for the other rune you rob it denying the enemy mid. While playing this role your goal in the laning stage is to make the opponent scared think of techies in the sense if there is a techies you are scared to roam but with riki its scared to come last hit and waste as much money on sentries trying to find you. To do this start with OoV stout and tangos then PMS and threads. You shouldnt have to use your tangos but it jsut lets yo constantly rotate and act as a medic. maxing e first then w. At level  have  skill wise and go to mid and once the enemy mid goes past the river cloud and right click him from behind make him have to walk past you. If he gets away thats fine. The enemy mid should now be scared to go back in for last hits. He will either camp behind the tower or call a support in. When he does rotate to safe lane. Do the same again. Basically constantly rotate around the map and just be as annoying as possible. By doing this your team should have lots of much space to farm. Riki is good for this because all you need is threads and after  you should be able to get some solo kills on supports. rightclick from behind cloud blink blink blink. If it gets to the point there are sentries on each lane rejoice. You have wasted  gold from the enemy support. That will be boots delayed for a good  minutes. At this time either go farm jungle or just constantly apply pressure. Avoid appearing on the map if you can because if they know where you are they are not scared of you. Also always carry tp.So in short from this example a roam is basically there to cause as much hassle for the enemy team in the laning stage. They will change in the mid to late game Riki turns into a ganker ES into a initatorMiranna into a semi core i believe etcEdit added conclusion,learndota2,cu6km14,1,t5_2tta4

4865690,0,t3_3hi7ki,I mean you could and it would work but I think its a huge waste of potential. It would be nice for the first  minutes but then unless you manage to execute constant ganks which is difficult without his ult youll fall off and feed every time you charge someone. Spirit breakers biggest strength aside from his global gank potential is his ability to show up to a fight and either blow up a support and or serve as a monstrously tanky bkb piercing disabler against the enemy carry. Simply put if youre under leveled and under farmed you wont survive long enough to serve that purpose. Because of how strong his bash chance is and his initiation potential hes almost always a high priority target in any fight. If you spent the first ten minutes of the game spending your precious little money on wards and not getting any experience he will quickly become nothing more than an initiator who can stun once or twice if hes lucky and then he dies. If youd like to know what I think the optimal way to play sb is feel free to ask I just came here to say that he is useless as a five risky as a four position and best in a three. ,learndota2,cu7uvu8,2,t5_2tta4

4941747,0,t3_3cvhm4,You know if you will win with CK before the game starts since you only pick CK ifVersus the right lineup AND When you have a solid laning supportIf the above criteria is met you can rape with CK in this patch he was heavily buffed last patch ignore the naysayers although they have a lot of valid points he is still viable. I love CK hes my fav hero and have over  winrate with him on about  games alt  main CK is about  winrate this patch I believe so people are having success with him too. Lets go over each oneCK is situational. I doubt anyone in the history of doto has won with CK when picking him first or even early. He has many counters some hard some soso but still lets go over his counters since that will let you know when NOT to pick him.CKs number  counter is Earth Shaker AKA that was a chaos dunk!. Until CK gets a heart an ES that blinks and ults a CK with his army just annihilates his illusions which nullifies CK do not ever pick CK when the enemy has ES.CK is weak against strong AoE nukes which is popular in this meta. Maybe not necessarily one specific AoE hero but a team with a sand kingwarlock can really ruin CKs day.A six slotted Sven PL Medusa or Ember Spirit will beat a six slotted CK unless the CK plays perfect so just stay away from these heroes if you can.So now you know when not to pick him. BUT you also need a solid laning support to ensure that CK gets early kills which he needs since he has no flash farming ability.CK lanes superbly with obviously IOKotL Mana all day for CK  KotL nuke CK rift  stun  KotL nuke  deathCM Mana regen passive and slowfreeze CK rift  stun  CM freeze  deathDazzle Heal bombs and poison touch and mana boots means CK never goes back to fountain and keeps on goingWD Has heal and stunTusk Snowball  CKs riftstun is a kill just do it early at lvl  or Really any support that is similar to the above is solid to include Undying.Ok so if the above is met right lineup good support then CK can go safelane or offlane. I like offlane sometimes since I can kill their squishy carry andor support versus going against a clockwerk or other traditionally hardtokill offlaners. But most of the time hes safelane.I typically go with GG branches shield clarity tangoes salve and then buy a quelling blade at the side shop. This varies widely based on who i am laning with and against I may get a wand if its against a spellspamming hero for example.CKs damage is varied since everything with him is RNG quelling blade makes last hitsdenies easy.There are many different builds some people like Midas on him but if I had to pick one I usually go with treads drums fixes mana issue and armlet as my first  early items. My goal is to have these three items by the time I get to level  plus a little gold in the bank. I especially need the armlet at level  because my skill build is QWQWQWQW E  R  R lvl .Focus on farming until you get to lvl  and have those beginning items especially armlet. Activate armlet before you ult and your illusions get the buff for their duration. CK can take a teamfight and a tower at lvl  with an armlet drums and treads. Sometimes I ult take a tower and proceed to take the next tower unless someone comes in to stop me free kill if illusions are still up. Since the illusions last ? seconds there is plenty of time to maximize his ult. By the time your illusions are dead youll only have a little over a minute before your ult is up again. The argument his ult is down forever so hes a walking ult just doesnt really meet the mustard since his ult last  seconds and he is still strong without it especially in the earlymid game.Midlate game on Ult kill enemies take objective. Farm until ult is back up repeat process until GG.My late game build is BoT armlet helm of dom upgrade to satanic later manta sometimes SnY sometimes HH heart then situational I personally include BKB as situational since he is an illusion hero I like having a  second BKB late game as opposed to rushing it but to each their own.CK rapes Huskar Jugg BH viper Pudge clinkz SB and other popular heroes and any other single target heroes PA  just get MKB and anyone remotely squishy is a shot by pressing W late game.His biggest weakness is not lack of mana since one item andor a solid support makes up for this but his lack of flash farm. To make up for this CK farms heroes. He farms heroes because you pick him against the right lineup and with a solid support.,learndota2,cuhg32f,2,t5_2tta4

4985565,0,t3_3j7nol,When youre building BF I think its better to go RoH gt Claymore gt Broadsword gt Voidstone Or voidstone before broadsword whatever because Claymore is the only item that makes Battlefury that you cant buy in the sideshop so its better to get it first in my opinion Plus you dont really benefit from the mana regenration of Voidstone until you start jungling and you dont start jungling until you have Battlefury.If you dont get Treads before Battlefury you should definitely get it after they give you attack speed that AntiMage REALLY needs so always get those There are exceptions of course. After BFTreads I like to go Vlads into Manta Sometimes I get Yasha before I get Vlads if I have less space to farm and can help in fights somewhat.After I get Manta I get whatever I think is best. Usually I play the ratting Antimage barely joining fights but constantly encouraging my teams to take them so I can rat My most recent example for that.Most of the time when I do that I get Butterfly right after Manta as  the attack speed gives a lot of push and Butterfly gives a lot of damage effectively increasing your pushing power by a lot also allowing you to move around the map faster with Flutter moving from lane to lane faster and increasing farming potential. From there I usually go Basher and then Heart into Abyssal.If you play more of the fighting Antimage then the build you suggested is usually the best one.,learndota2,cumy13p,1,t5_2tta4

With the usualy AM build  you already need  min until you can fight treads bf vlads manta but then you can atleast kill supports without problems. With boots of travel instead of treads you spend more gold to do less damage early game makes the game probably more stressful for your team than needed.

5017805,0,t1_cuqt59d,Not to be an ass or anything but it honestly looks like you could of won this game for your team. There were a few good ways to shut down them stopping you from farming. First you should of always have a remnant somewhere far away and safe when you go anywhere to farm. Once things start looking shady on the map you can just move to it. Secondly I would say you could of easily gotten more farm by purely warding your own jungle with sentries so you could detect an invis gank. Then you can just remnant out and you are good to go. Third in my opinion Skadi is a very sketch second big item. You probably could of easily increased your GPM and damage output by getting your Daedalus instead. This would allow you to clear waves and your jungle quicker while also defending high ground like its cake. Fourth and probably last is that you spent a good portion of time standing around with your team accomplishing nothing. During this time you could be getting farm while following safe practices and gotten another item to help defend. Ember is a very easy character to farm mid game on so you should focus on that bro. ,learndota2,cuqu454,1,t5_2tta4

Juggs abilities all have value points since they dont scale linearly and stats give him mana he desperately needs in the early game.  Note they would use him as a midlate game ricing rightclick carry not the aghs drums max q earlyfighting build you see occasionally not terrible but shouldnt be played as a safelane pos  IMO. A common build might be PMS amp tangos in the safelanegt Brown boots gt Phase or treads although the phase active stacks nicely with MoM gt Aquila gt MoM gt Yasha gt SampY or Manta gt Basher gt late game items Abyssal BKB Skadi or Butterfly as needed Magic wandstick can be thrown in depending on lane  e.g. with offlaner spammers like batbristle although Jugg typically can move to jungle after his morbid mask very early on and hence is typically unnecessary Not often built in the pro scene during Juggs hayday but I quite like battlefury if purchased before the  minute mark. With his low BAT and crit BF clears waves very quickly and ensures his late game farm. When fighting with MoM make sure to use the active just before you use omnislash in order to maximize the number of attacks you can get in between slashes. If you find your self in trouble after your ult you can always use Q to dispel the the extra damage debuff and TP away changed in . apparently. Cant stress the synergy Jugg has with MoM enough its so good and speeds up his farm dramatically. Jugg didnt get nerfed too hard by . no more ministun from omni  MoM movespeed nerf most prominently but I think he isnt picked competitively as much simply because other heros work better in this meta.,learndota2,cuv6c6v,1,t5_2tta4

It also complements with my build where I go EoS next so im super tanky for a  riki and players were already irritated from my earlygame roaming so they more often than not focus me in fight.

One of the easiest ways to improve would be to stop doing that. Part of why this happens is because you seem obsessed with aghs buying it on basically every hero.

Drow is a pretty straight forward hero  her passive ult is ridiculous and her global aura give her and every other ranged hero on your team a decent damage boost.

5176380,0,t3_3lwhzx,From the Dotabuff itself I can tell that you didnt have That great of an early game so you couldnt take control of the enemy side to take away their farm at all.Probably no vision in their jungle so you could not punish them taking farm. You also had no hard carry which is stable after the  minute mark. Tony falls off way to hard in the lategame and without a wisp he cant take any rax by himself without getting punished by the enemy line up.Storm and Disruptor have way too much farm for the kills they have they have been free farming the whole game and you dont wanna face a Disruptor that farmed in the lategame. Your lineup also does not really fit all that well together you have strong teamfight on paper and strong push but it just doesnt work against that enemy team which can position themselves very easily and have great counter initiate.If I watch the replay it probably goes like thisEarly game you made couple kills onto the mid and meaby rotated to help a lane you got the Ts early because of Tiny and Lesh but after that your team transitioned to a halfassed farm modus which you punished yourself with two of you farmed your jungle the other two farmed ancients and a lane and one which was the abaddon prolly just stayed passive behind someone and soak exp.Meanwhile the enemy did the same but in a more efficient manner Lina BS and CK roamed around to find kills thus creating space for Storm to farm the woods and Lane and same goes for Disruptor.Both then joined the team after they wiped  or  of your team and they started to push towers you lost your Ts and the enemy started to pressure your Side of the River and farmed your jungle as well.While the enemy got stronger your team played more and more passive and didnt make any move at all.The way you lost this is by not taking any action and continue the siege of the high ground. You probably not used any smokes to make some ganks happen with that enigma and you didnt put on enough pressure early to mid game thus the enemy found an opening and make your team feel unease and from that point onward they won.,learndota2,cv9xzps,2,t5_2tta4
5178725,0,t3_3lx7jn,He take some practice but I enjoy ember spirit.  He can be tough to deal with if the enemy isnt used to playing against him.  If its a low skill game I think its fun to get travels and max flame guard first.  If theres a fight happening you get tp there and contribute make sure to be able SoF into chains.  In any downtime you can tp to a creepwave and farmpush with flameguard up and have an easy escape with a remnant you put down before.  Eventually youll get enough farm for some big items like a bfury or two daedalus or two and a defensive item.  The ability to have an escape remnant up really helps you position yourself aggressively you can always escape as long as youre arent stunned or silenced.

If you let an important player on the enemy team play their own style of game then you have no excuses when they snowball and beat you. If you change up your own strategy then you can upset them. Yes you can get a bit behind by sharing xp and farm but the nighstalker will get even further behind because he relies on this early game snowball to be effective.

5264072,0,t1_cvkj6mi,Urn medallion stickwand for mana regen. You dont need stats and armour. Your job is not to hit people with your right clicks. Your job is to swap out of position heroes enemies or allies stun enemies hit them with your wave of terror and then live long enough for your aura to increase the damage of your team. Then any utility items you have can be used mek medallionsolar glimmer etc.. I dont know what you mean about wand not being good on Venge. Sounds to me like youre not using it properly because wand is great on Venge. You should be buying wand or stick on pretty much every hero every game. Its so efficient. The only exceptions are heroes like Antimage or Naga that want to splitpush only and hence wont build up many charges. Even they should build it in the laning phase against some matchups though.Tranquil boots and Mana boots are the best choices for support venge. Treads CAN be ok if youre up against heavy nukers like tinker so you dont die so often but generally just stay back and you wont need the extra hp. ,learndota2,cvkjkyf,1,t5_2tta4
5266108,0,t3_3n4rj6,BootsTreads are the way to go. Since the change to desolate you actually need the attack speed to farm decently.RoA vs DrumsRing is probably the better option since its more costefficient. A lot of pros build urn as well since the urn  ring costs about the same as a drum and gives the same HP and you end up getting urn charges often with haunt.I dont think lifesteal on spectre is very good since she ends up doing most of her damage through dispersion and desolate lategame and rarely does a ton of physical DPS. BF spec is definitely not going to be a thing. AC is good on spec but I think in most cases youd want someone else to build it if you can.,learndota2,cvksycx,2,t5_2tta4

Killing spec in the chrono without bkb brought void to  health at most. Bkb did block dispersion. That being said I think even with bkb if spec waits to haunt until after chorno spec wins every time.

5295999,0,t3_3niu7d,I didnt watch your game because Im on mobile with poo Internet but I can offer basic pointers. Its important to learn to balance farming and fighting. Itll change every game and just comes with experience. You need to recognize when you being more farmed will help the team than you trying to fight all the time and vice versa. The hero youre playing can also affect this. Map awareness is key. Its important not to die needlessly as a carry since you being farmed is important to your team and since you should be a higher net worth youll give a lot of gold to the other team. Be efficient. Stack when you can only use your mana in lane for last hits and try to farm lane creeps as safely and as much as possible since theyre worth more gold ,learndota2,cvomiap,1,t5_2tta4

We did well in our lanes but could not turn that into a lasting advantage in the mid game. The enemy Undying got a very quick Aghanims and we could not fight into that at all. Our thoughts were that the enemy teams defensive and team fight prowess was too great and we thus we could not destroy their safelane tier  tower until quite late into the game.

5395223,0,t1_cw153x1,In addition to cast point for most spells the hero has to be facing the target so turn rate also comes into play. Dazzle takes . sec to turn  degrees which adds further time to the grave if youre sitting in the wrong spot.Although it sucks when you misplay and people from other games complain about Dota feeling laggy all these stats are really important from a balance perspective. Icefrog can make a hero slightly better or slightly worse with these minor changes without nerfing the theme of the hero. An overpowered hero can remain overpowered in the right situation but it takes more concentration and planning to execute with nerfs to turn rate cast point etcA great example is Earth Shaker he used to be considered a rubbish support hero in the competitive scene good if you were ahead but a liability if you were behind. He has a powerful set of skills so buffing his damage might make him too OP hed crush the early game when hes supposed to be weaker and dominate with early blink and crit items. Instead Icefrog buffed his turn rate so he can more reliably position himself to execute his spells. He is now picked as a useful support hero with a long range stun instead of missing stuns and turning into food as was the case when he was behind before the turn rate buff.OP dont stress too much about this stuff youll get used to it in time. When you miss time a spell make a mental note that it has a delay and try to go earlier next time.,learndota2,cw1at39,2,t5_2tta4

5406438,0,t1_cw1y23u,You have to understand the difference between .k and .k and also if you dont play on SEA then let me tell you that SEA is absolute shit. I have played both supports and carries in SEA and actually though I maintain  winrate in it at .k MMR bracket its just very frustrating to play there.   And for me as a carry the more frustrating thing is not that I have a carry or support who is trying to last hit in lane with me but the problem is that he is ruining last hit. Like my damage is  and his damage is  or  and I am waiting for creep to get low enough so I can last hit and he attacks the creep at such time that he doesnt get last hit and creep dies due to other creep attack after that which mean that last hit is ruined. And as a support when my carry cant even farm in a uncontested lane. I get meka and carry just want to afk farm I ward and enemy passes under obs wards and even when I ping and say them to get back still they die and say we need wards. And as solo support expect me to have gold mine inside me at all times specially against riki. When they feed him and he is so fat that I cant even go out of tower range. So please understand the problem before criticizing anyone. Remember there are  banes of k MMR bracket. Pudge Riki Ursa and now a days legion. And all of them make life of a support miserable if one lanes goes wrong or specially when noone wants to gank legion in jungle though she is always at low health its frustrating to play support.,learndota2,cw2qduy,1,t5_2tta4

Ideally what youll do after level  in your nuke is get all the creeps or most of them low through auto attacking  creeps have  magic resistance so just know how much your nuke does and then clear the full wave for  cs.

5439308,0,t3_3phsnr,Ancients. Always stack and do ancients. You should usually start stacking after  minutes so that at about  you have atleast a tri stack and always have atleast level  Psi Blases when you do so.TA can push and split push so well with Blink as an escape or initiation and Deso  Psi blades can melt both creep waves and towers. Enemy cant defend lanes with just  hero unless its a tanky core like Bristleback but thats space created for your team. Keep the map warded as much as possible with your traps and even put traps in lane. Itll help slowing down pushes and catching up to fleeing enemies.MKB and Butterfly are good and viable items for TA but a bit more situational imo. Occasionally I would prefer going Daedalus for damage rather than MKB AC instead of Butterfly and a BKB if needed. Though if there is another natural AC carrier feel free to go Butterfly.AC just helps reduce enemy armor a lot more give her nice attack speed to twoshot incoming creep waves and good armor for physical attacks. Butterfly is nice too because it gives Evasion which can save Refrac charges. Also nice attack speed damage and that Flutter active. Daedalus just lets you crit coupled with a  cleave from Psi Blades. Need I explain? BKB and if not Linkens can help you a lot as it can prevent you from being locked down and BKB nullifies magic damage and can save Refrac charges. Heart is also a poor choice of an item for TA.If you want you can build her differently. Ive seen Sumail build her with Treads Manta Butterfly Skadi Daedalus BKB. Im guessing it goes Treads RoA Yasha BKB DaedalusCrystalis ButterflySkadi Manta SkadiButterfly finish Daedalus if havent. Just a guess though.,learndota2,cw6xb1y,2,t5_2tta4

5461823,0,t3_3pucgg,Its not a big deal but its still important to stack. Not only are you creating resources on the map for your team but youre also missing from the map which should threaten your opponents. The former is also important for you you can leech xp from the empty lane of the core that farms the stack OR leech xp while he farms the stack both without fucking over the xpm of the core.  The latter thing being off the map might not be that huge in lower level pubs however. Also the stack time is a decent time to gank because the mid hero is likely to push the lane to go for rune so you can wrap around behind him easier. So sometimes you might want to go for gank instead of stacking.gt I guess if its a dual lane how much should I be stacking and pulling if we are winning the lane?In a v you dont want to pull as a rule of thumb. Unless the lane is pushed extremely. In a v youll want to pull when the lane isnt balanced or when you cant zone or when youyour core badly needs some levels.Counterwarding is huge. The darker their map the easier your game. But if you cant afford it you cant do it. You cant just buy  sentries and place them everywhere. Youll have to either know that theres a ward or make a justified guess. Keep track of their inventory. That also means having vision yourself makes dewarding extremely easier. Also keep in mind that you dont have to deward every obs you know of. Sometimes its too dangerous sometimes its a waste of time  their obs might not see anything of importance  and sometimes dewarding can give away your own vision. Additionally unless you have hard control of the map or need the vision RIGHT NOW dont use an obvious obs to gain highground vision to deward.gt Stacking and pulling in particular seem really difficult because you have to be in an exact spot at an exact time and waiting at a camp to stack it also seems like a waste of time.You have to get a feeling for how much time to need to walk to the spot.gt How many wards is too much mid and late game? When to buy sentries outside of invis opponents?Always get obs. If you are about to complete an item as position  supp ask your team to buy them.gt When to buy sentries outside of invis opponents?Try to make a habit of getting  set of sents when going into midgame so you can make some guesses when moving aggressively. Then got some whenever they run out. Apart from that whenever you know of a ward OR want to make sure for example for roshing.gt I guess my question is what does good pos  and  play look like other than buying courier and slinging spells?Early game not taking resources from your cores and creating some by ganking stacking pulling etc. You also want to protect the resources by warding and counterganking and babysitting. Also reducing your opponents resources is your job blocking ancients ganking zoning harassing. You also set up early fights and tower pushes and keep track of itemization.,learndota2,cw9ssmn,1,t5_2tta4

I see that your harassing skills arent that good.You should keep in mind about  range of creep aggro.You should position yourself far away from creeps so you can harass them easily.Purge had made a video on .k Windranger and its mostly about postitioning maybe you should watch that.  minutes into the game Omni was mid and bane was alone on top.U could have easily killed bane and you would have gained momentum from there.Purifying flames is a great nuke for killing people.Just use that and immediately purge healing by first ability.First killmissed  They dived so deep and it was an easy kill on bane.Just use your combo.When you see that they are in a bad positionjust go attack them.They made a mistake and you cannot forgive them for that You had your creeps with you.They drew the aggro Communicate with PA thats is time to go on them  Bane was alone and you attacked her instead of stopping with ur first skill.Another killwasted kills wasted till now You didnt stack for tinker  he is an amazing farmer with machines.If you had stacked for him it would lead to a fast dagon and he could have helped you a lot.

Basically any time past  min dire usually loses its rosh advantage unless theyre ahead on towers in which case theyre supposed to have the advantage. Radiant jungle however is really good.  camps near mid means flash farmers like SF do well on radiant its much easier to ward to protect the main jungle area compared to dire and tp support is much easier to radiant jungle than dire jungle.

5615616,0,t3_3s0t7w,As ucantadmittoposting already said it well most heroes have counters but only a select few have truly debilitating shutdown counters. Most of the time youre better off making your team agree to a strategy and picking towards that.But there are some safe heroes that are always relevant. Couple of those     Earthshaker fits every lineup by bringing amazing lockdown and teamfight potential. Also can be played as a roaming support or an offlaner.    Vengeful Spirit is similar cookiecutter skills with an ult optimized for feeding making plays can be played as a support or a carry.  Ogre Magi brings lockdown some AoE AS  MS buffs and stupid tankiness for dominance during laning phase. His roaming potential is off the fucking charts too.   Spirit Breaker is either an offlaner or a roaming shitstarter much like Bounty Hunter but while the latter gets countered by detection you cannot counter the space cow. It forces your opponents to not pick that SF mid like they wanted and the presence of a mad bull charging back and forth across the whole map might put them off balance.   Juggernaut Slardar Sven are carries that are tough to deal with since their only counter is being kited so you might force out some disabler picks that youll deal with by buying BKB or just playing Juggernaut or even better something like a Bane or Shadow Demon that your opponents will hopefully not know how to play.   Queen of Pain has been a consistently popular mid for a reason you cant counterpick her you can only counterplay her. If you dont blink into  people like a moron youll be all good and will have your impact on the game. Same with Zeus squishy caster on paper but only for like  minutes or so the dude has . STR gain which tanks him up pretty severely while his damage output is always relevantand the only true counter to him is Huskar which in turn cannot be picked first or he will get countered by physical and pure damage. Just some off the top of my head. ,learndota2,cwt66kj,10,t5_2tta4

5708382,0,t1_cx4ng9j,Watching the match explains the source of my confusion and why I was wrong to talk down supports jumping in to save allies I usually play supports whose spells and autoattacks are ranged which to be fair is most of them. I mentioned Venge but I forgot the example of Sand King.Sand King is a hero where jumping in to save carries at the cost of your own life makes absolute sense because your stun is also the spell you could have used as an escape mechanism. In fact I just alttabbed back into the replay and saw a perfect example of you using your stun on two chasing enemies the Jugg and the Antimage which should have saved both the Windranger and the Viper. This was a good play and it was also pretty suicidal because they had enough truesight including a sentry to kill you. Maybe you could have considered walking up to stun and immediately blinking away before getting hit. Unfortuantely the Viper and the Windranger took this as their cue to reengage and both died almost immediately after p But thats just their inexperience and being nice to the sk. The principle behind that stun and the execution was very good.I do maintain that if youre playing a typical support you should be able to get off most of your arsenal without jumping in too far  or you should at least try to. But Ive learned something today that Venge isnt the only support than can make legitimate suicidal plays.Also I dont know why I thought your original post said you were at  MMR.

5806561,0,t3_3upwga,The real problemThis is actually such a common mistake!But I dont think its limited to wandstick. Are you comfortable using your items active abilities? Are you good with a Force Staff? Do you forget to use Mekansm? Do you overlook the fact that Helm of Dominator has a extremely useful active ability?The biggest issue I had was realizing that a dota hero doesnt have  abilities only. They all have . You just get to chose what the last  will be.Having  active abilities means more buttons to push. Its difficult it takes practice and once you are fully comfortable with it youll find the level of your game will have vastly improved.How to improve? Spend enough time in the settings configuring comfortable keybindings for the  item slots. Dont forget to experiment withwithout quickcast Have a predetermined slot for important items. Dont just drag it to a random available slot. For instance my magic stick will generally be bound to the c key. Pressing c when my HP or MP is low is now second nature to me. Invest in gaming gear. Gaming mouses will provide you with extra buttons to press which could be comfortable for you. Gaming keyboard are easier to use than your Macbook Airs office keyboard. Dont wait until youre super low on HP to cast the wand. If your enemy can kill you in less than  seconds which starting the midgame is common for support players you shouldnt try to be all efficient with the Wand usage. Pop it as soon as the enemy initiates on you. Practice using items active skills in private lobbies vs bots you can practice it against humans too but it might ruin the game for all of you. For instance play as Lifestealer get a Blink Dagger and a Force Staff. Practice being highly mobile to get in and out of fights and catch fleeing heroes. The goal here is to make you more comfortable with your items active abilities so that you are always ready to click the right one at the right time.More Magic StickWand adviceThis goes a bit further than just clicking the wand at the right time.  StickWand  is great for HP in the early game but its effectiveness fades pretty quickly. However it remains a great source of MP well into the midgame especially for starved support players. You dont always need to upgrade to a Wand. Sometimes a Stick is a great pickoff by itself. StickWand charges are capped  charges max. You dont want to keep them fully charged at all. In other words every time and enemy casts a spell and you dont get a charge because youre already maxed out you decrease your efficiency. That last point is important. StickWand is not an item whose sole purpose is to save you from an inextremis death. If youre just waiting for your HP to drop under  to pop your Wand at the right time youre missing out on what makes that item great. Be more liberal with your stickwand usage. It is really a great item during a big part of the game especially for heroes who want to fight a lot. Use it to keep your HPMP high which allows you to reengage fights more often.Of course keep in mind a count of all the enemies available spells. If youre playing against a lineup of heroes with mostly passive spells play more conservatively with your charges or avoid the Magic Stick altogether.,learndota2,cxguxhj,17,t5_2tta4

5813953,0,t3_3urkjf,Despite all the advice to start playing against real people right away I think your strategy is better. Play and come in top  in at least  hard bot matches. Bots sometime snowball and u cant always have the best scores but its ok if you had a good game yourself. Just remember playing a few bot matches are not enough doing good in them is. As for not having a large hero pool you can get away with  heros for the first    matches as everyone says no one you get matched with knows how to play any hero you have an advantage as you played a lot of bot matches with that  herosAnd yes real people behave very differently than bots. Bots make and repeat some simple mistakes that real people make only  of the time. Bot matches are not a way to learn everything write and exam and get a degree to be not noob in pub. But it gives you an edge that will make you better than other  playersStill dont get cocky and start flaming them.

5829714,0,t1_cxjso7y,The opening double waving I demonstrate is a strategy that exploits a level advantage level  vs. a level  in the middle lane.  Since the bounty gives  exp it only takes  creeps dying to reach level .  Its super unlikely that youre able to tank a wave for the  seconds required so that  or less of their creeps dont die.  Also most mids use the g to send out a salve immediately which makes the early trade a bad one.However double waving is still a really useful skill for diving any lane at any time during the laning phase.

Supporting in rhe laning stage is all about stacking camps harassing the other heroes in your lane and denying creeps. Try to help the carry get as much farm as possible. Also try to buy everything your team will need in terms of team items. You dont necessarily have to wander the map the whole game warding. Just make sure they are availble for your teammates to place too. Buy them and leave them in the fountain. Also helps to pick heroes that dont need a lot of items to be good.

5847877,0,t3_3vasyg,Just a headsup you can not crit with attacks while affected by Shadowblade invisibility.In my opinion this makes Shadowblade fairly weak because of it so I dont get it myself. A lot of crit Shakers do buy it so I cant fault it its strong sometimes.  If you get a blink dagger you just have to make sure you actually have time to blink in and land a stun with Enchant Totem.Otherwise I dont think AC was the right choice. The premise of Crit Shaker is that you go in and blast people with a huge crit burst before they have time to react and AC doesnt really facilitate that.I would recommend getting some cheap stat items like Magic Stick and Power Treads before either blink or shadowblade. It doesnt take much because of the x multiplier to get a lot of extra damage.After that you can get a Daedalus or sometimes a Desolator against low armor heroes.

The  mana cost to produce illusions costs Medusa hp since mana directly adds to dusas EHP. The illusions themselves do not have mana shield even with stat builds a significant portion of what makes Medusa so hard to kill is the mana shield as her base str and str gain are hilariously pitiful  seriously she is squishier than tb.Casual yasha adds decently efficient stats but the ultimate orb should just go towards skadi linkens or whatever unless there are dispellable statuses particularly very long silences or disarms that are critical to get rid of and even then bkb which gives damage and hp anyways is probably better.,learndota2,cxuftas,1,t5_2tta4

5918749,0,t3_3wbjb6,Nobody is answering your pull question so Ill let you know.There are two ways to do this not including stacking the dire easy camp.Easy way pull dire easy camp when your creeps are passing the last jungle juke spot. Run to the creeps through your lane towards the base not through the jungle run straight up to the tower and immediately to the right. This will depend on your camp as well. If you have ghosts you have to pull earlier because the frost ghost will slow you.Once your creeps have been pulled to the camp sit to the left of the camp closer to the radiant tower. When there are only two creeps left pull the bottom left hard camp this is the closest to radiant offlane tower. Remember to pull when there are only two neutrals left in the easy camp because this will allow the creeps to finish off the easy camp and then move to the hard camp.If you notice that your creeps wont kill the last two in time to aggro to the hard camp use your spells to clear them. This will take practice to master and even I mess it up regularly.Again I will stress two neutrals left in the easy camp pull the bottom left hard camp.The other way is more difficult only because the radiant will see what you are doing. Pull the dire left most hard camp same camp to meet your creeps just AFTER your safe lane t tower. That spot you can enter your jungle just after your tower. The hard camp will follow you close enough to draw aggro and your creeps will die.This way is much harder because radiant will contest it  of the time and you cant really do much about it. Your creeps will take  seconds or so to die and in that time the radiant offlaner will go to that camp and kill both your creeps and the camp.Good luck.

In the offlane whoever controls the lane is usually determined by who was successfully more aggressive in the first  minutes of the lane. You should use quills to safely get last hits until you get level  or  quills. Then you just try and stack them and once they get  stacks on them they will start running away from how much it hurts. Then every time they get close to last hit again you hit them with quills. ,learndota2,cxwwnwz,1,t5_2tta4

5976914,0,t3_3xawej, Smoke is best used during night time due to reduced vision range for most heroes. It is also best to push your lanes out   players missing when their tower s under attack is an obvious sign that they smoked. Smoke is only revealed by nearby enemy heroes not illusions nearby enemy towers and attacking any unit spells dont reveal. Rubick usually buys Force Staff andor Blink Dagger as his major item. Positioning is very important on him and with those items he can be a much bigger influence. Aghanims is excellent but he is not a goldpriority hero. Supports shouldnt buy faerie fire. The  health isnt good enough and they dont need  damage. Dont skip wards if you dont have  on the map. early game help your core heroes in lane harrassbully the enemy pull lane creeps into neutral camps gives you more exp and possible gold stack neutrals telepOrt to help allies during enemy dives. Creep aggro is determined by distance  if you click an enemy hero while you stand within  units of an enemy creep the creep will attack you. However they can only aggro you once every  seconds so if you have no other choice than to be  units near the creeps you can run away and come back and attack within  seconds without drawing aggro again. Omni can do almost nothing against the enemy in lane. Hes a defensive support a greedy one. Pros dont ever pick him because its an automatic lost lane. But in pubs many people arent smart enough to punish greed. Tranquil if you need armor.

6018556,0,t3_3xx0nb,Well from what it seems you lost partly because of your laning setup.Axe can solo the hard lane just fine and with his lane opponents being both melee he would actually win the lane due to Counter Helix. You could have helped PA who had to lane bot with Riki and likely had to compete for last hits with him too.

6049487,0,t1_cyc73w9,I disagree. Support heroes are pretty much early game carries. They dominate the laning phase only to fall off in power as the game progresses. If you have crappy support theres a chance you wont make it to the late game i.e. there wont be a late game if you get rekt early on.Support heroes need a lot of map awareness which is scarce at the lower MMR brackets. What will happen is that your cores will have to split their attention between last hitting and checking the minimap. Good cores already do both but with a bad support the cores have to devote extra attention to map awareness reducing their last hitting potential.,learndota2,cyclas5,1,t5_2tta4

Attack speed is awesome because you already have lots of damage from ults and Midas takes you to longest Duel duration and most damage giving ASAP.Bloodseeker really benefits from attack speed because he has high damage from Thirst.

6076965,0,t1_cyg33mj,Completely agree with the you will rise if you deserve it part.I dropped from K to .K when I initially began solo ranked.  I played a lot of blame games instead of focusing on what I did wrong.  Then my friend got the game and I played a lot of unranked because she was afraid of being flamed in ranked.  With no MMR to worry about I started analyzing the entire game and where things could have gone differently instead of jumping to blame someone for feeding or something stupid.One game where I was harassed for not joining in a team fight and accused of throwing I went back and checked the replay.  On a mid push we wiped  enemies and took their t.  Last enemy was at  or lower.  Our top lane was pushing their high ground.  Out of the  free seconds with a single enemy  were spent by our entire team chasing them through the dire secret shop area.  It was pretty much a free racks but we were driven by greed.  So yeah I threw but it wasnt just the last push where I was apart from the team trying to split push top.  It was completely missing the opportunity to take top Racks when we had a chance.A lot of times people immediately start pointing fingers at feeders but if you could have helpedprevented it you are just as much to blame.  Bad lane matchups happen and its everyones responsibility to do whats necessary to win.I recently went back to ranked and in the past two weeks Ive climbed to  with  win rate.  From .K to K I went on a  win streak.  Now that Im almost k MMR higher I feel like its slowing down but the gamesteams are usually more fun to play with.,learndota2,cyg6atg,1,t5_2tta4

6079312,0,t1_cyetyn2,So to start off I really liked your starting items. Good amount of survivability and regen. Another option can go if it will be an easier lane is boots tangos and clarity. Both are fine.  Good job zoning for the rune! You even got nyx to waste some mana which is nice it basically cost you nothing and helped get your team the rune. Like you said it is unfortunate that you have a troll in lane taking your last hits and xp but hey its a pub it happens. At level  you skilled Flame Break which is a mistake. You should always skill Firefly because it allows you to do much more damage than flame break AND gives you the option to juke over cliffs and through tress. Flame break only does  instances of damage whereas firefly can give you over ten which is much better with napalm.  Ok so you tried to dive their tower. Although it did not work out it really wasnt that terrible of an idea. Batrider can push out some good damage early on. The problem is you do not have a level advantage on them due to troll. If you are going to try and kill them you should first pull the hard camp to your creep wave and start the dive when the enemy is closer to your tower so you spend less time under their tower. Nyx and tusk are also hard to kill as batrider. They go on you and you sort of get baited into going for kills. I think you just failed to recognize you were not doing enough damage and lost track of how much time you had left on firefly. Keep a look out for this. When is starts to get low just go for the closest cliff. You also did not use flame break. Nyx and tusk kill KotL and go for another kill on you. You play it well and start getting stacks of napalm on them while they chase and you wait for firefly to come off cd. You however spectacularly miss flamebreak by a mile. not quite sure how this happened. Either way you get a kill on nyx even though you die but that is fine. You then tp mid and get a good kill on pudge using lasso you also missed flamebreak by a mile haha work on thatAlright so on my other reviews I kept up the minute by minute analysis but that is because they were missing out on a ton of little stuff. You seem to have a great idea on how to play so I will focus on giving some tips. When farming multiple camps with firefly try to kill a few more trees. You left too small of paths for the camp to follow so they end up walking a different path not along your firefly trail. Once you got your blink dagger I would highly suggest buying a smoke and looking for a pick off that way. You need to look at their heroes and decide which ones you can solo kill and which ones you need help with. You need to throw your flame breaks close to you. To many times you throw them to the other side of your enemy and they have moved out the way because it moves so slow. If you throw it in front of them it is more likely to hit and chances are they are attacking you so they will just walk back to you after they are pushed back. So this game came down to a couple things. First was you had a useless troll the whole game but let us move past that. Second you missed batriders power spike. What i mean by this is that bat is very strong from the  minute mark. Once you have lasso you need to smoke look for a kill then go farm the jungle or lane. Once lasso is off cd again just rinse and repeat. I know Lone druid was taking up some jungle but you could have been stacking the camp near the offlane. There were many opportunities in the beginning where you just seemed to forget that you had stick or flamebreak up. Try to be more conscious of what you have available to you. You did get better at this as the game went on but missing those early game opportunities really makes the game hard. You bought gem on bat which was a fantastic pick up this game. You recognized why your team was getting caught out and was missing kills and helped give you guys a chance. My only advice on this is to play a bit more defensivley when you have the gem. You jumped in on solo pickoffs without any info on where the rest of the enemy team was and ended up losing gem. Make sure you make safe plays with the gem. Refresher is a great item on bat but not as your rd item. I much rather get either a Euls ghost scepter into eblade or even BoT as my rdth items. At the end of the day this was a hard bat game. Pretty much their whole team is great against Bat but you did well working with what you had. Like you asked firefly is perfectly fine for using when looking for an enemy just be sure to be lurking in the trees when using it so they cannot prepare for you jumping in. When in a teamfight you want to lasso whoever does a lot of damage on their team but you can also kill during the duration of lasso. WR and Tusk are good examples this game. Anyways I hope this was helpful if you have any other questions feel free to ask!And I also wrote an offlane Beastmaster guide a couple of months ago! Here ,learndota2,cyghbwj,2,t5_2tta4

Basi start is a bit crummy because it doesnt really make your gold work for you that much. You get some mana regen . and  damage for  gold. Not a lot for a lot of money. You could just get some sticks and circlet and another salve. Now you wont have to go home if you get hit by a few autos. ,learndota2,cyj9j1i,3,t5_2tta4

6109615,0,t3_3z820x,Youre absolutely right in the diverse paths axe can take in item builds which are all unfortunately influenced by a large amount of factors.  Depending on what your team needs you can begin itemizing for a tank build which usually involves a heart of tarrasque andor bkb.  You want to back this up with some armour in which case both AC and Shivas are good I generally just pick up a platemail after a bkb purchase and see which item is better for the game.  Aghanims has its uses although Im not a big fan of the item it really helps in  man teams.

6111116,0,t3_3z9g0a,That question is a little weird. Why would it?From the Wikigt Backdoor protection activates when there are no nearby enemy creeps in approximately an  radius and causes the building to take  damage from illusions and  damage from other units. If a backdoorprotected building is damaged by an enemy it will regenerate the lost health at a rate of  HP per second. It is still possible to destroy protected buildings with sufficiently high damage.So everything deals reduced damage.,learndota2,cyk9s0b,1,t5_2tta4

6209960,0,t3_40m3mk,DK in my opinion is a hero that is really dependent on levels more so than items. Thats why hes most effective when played as a midlaner. There are basic items however that are quite important. Always start with a Stout Shield in combination with his high armor  health regen from his passive he takes almost no damage from creeps it allows you to trade hits with enemy heroes in lane and maybe force them out if they dont have enough regen themselves. However his base damage is quite low so dont try to vs other heroes with a lot of physical damage early. Thats also the reason why you want a Quelling Blade as a starting item to get easier last hits and increase his farming potential. All you need now is a set of tangos and maybe a clarity potion and an iron branch. I highly suggest levelling his Q ability early on as it allows you to harass enemy heroes in lane or even get kills and can really turn teamfights in your favour if you hit  or  heroes with it. As soon as you hit level  use that dragon form to poke your opponent and push for their tower the damage over time is a great tool for harassment and might lead to a kill if your opponent is too greedy.Your first item after that should be a bottle its your main form of mana regen then go brown boots into magic wand into treads. Then if youre doing fine on levels you should get a mobility item either Blink or Shadow Blade if youre behind you should probably go directly for tanky items like Drums. BKB is really important on DK as your main source of damage in the mid and lategame is your right click splash damage in dragon form. Then youre pretty much free depending on the situation i like to get a Daedalus for more damage Satanic andor Assault Cuirass if you need to tank up.,learndota2,cyvi7gm,1,t5_2tta4

Im gonna try a Treads gt Blademail gt Octarine gt Aghs gt Shivas gt BoTs gt Mjollnir build at some point though it sounds fun.

6278308,0,t3_41l59c,The basics of it is he got nerfed hard in patch . after August  where he was one of the most pickedbanned heroes at the TI event  unreasonably so since he wasnt even super good like Leshrac was at TI etc.Plasma fields minimum damage halved  previously at level  the spell would do at least  nuke damage to targets right next to you now it does a max of . This makes it a super underwhelming spell if you are initiated on since it does next to no damage.Static links mana cost was increased  previously  mana you could spam it in the langing stage every time it was on cooldown and would never have mana issues. The cooldown was also increased used to be a flat  at all levels and you keep the damage stole for  seconds meaning that you could theoretically have damage stolen for  seconds or  of the time if you spammed it off cooldown. Now cooldown is increased to  meaning at levels  and  you have an extra  and  second cooldown meaning  gives you at most  uptime and since you usually only get two levels in the laning stage and then max plasma field thats as much as you are going to get. Without the static link stolen damage Razor simply doesnt dominate his lane. His attack range is not high doesnt have an orb attack to zone enemies doesnt have any other sort of attack boosting steroid etc. Finally his late game was nerfed through Eye of the Storm nerfs. Dying with Aegis while Eye of the Storm is active makes it not be active when he revives which now makes him a very bad aegis carrier. On top of that the strike interval for strikes was increased from . at level  to .. The end result of this is that you get  less strikes by the end of the duration used to give max of  strikes damage now gives  strikes which is a  reduction in the raw damage and  less minus armour.So in summary  massive nerfs to his early game prevent him dominating his lane like he used to be able to nerfs to his midgame plasma field damage nerfs to his late game aghs damage.,learndota2,cz39u7h,4,t5_2tta4

6349574,0,t1_czbcaoh,Thats a pretty broad question as I cant really speak for everyone but I will tell you that I focus farming and pushing lanes above fighting. I like to farm their safe lane and jungle to deny them farm and let my team push the other lanes. A lot of it is farming patterns and tread switching both of which are things I focus heavily on while I am playing. Use blink on cool down to move between farm and always be farming in a way that creates pressure in the enemy team if its safe to do so. Tread switching is very important because you will be blinking on cd and possibly using manta for farming as well as using abyssal and ulti for a pick off. Basically I just rat and farm everything fast enough to where they have to devote  or  people to stop my push at which point my team will be pushing the other side of the map until we high ground and win.

That being said if I went for a more agressive mid game build I would probably go for diffu into manta into skadiheart later.I think that value yasha movement speed is just too good to pass up because it scales off the spectral dagger. Diffusal costs more then yasha so you get it slower gt in comparisson Id have earlier yasha over slower diffusal.Deff would build if needed for utility ie. we need dispells or we lack slows. But for the most time I find OOV  Yasha more then enough.gt I like Heart  Skadi on Spectre a lot. At low MMR people dont understand that trying to kill a spectre will get them killed so I just build my spec to be very tanky and statheavy my slotted build is radibotsskadiheartbflyACdiffumaybe MKB.Why I favour octarine core over heart is because it gives mana to sustain dagger and manta spam it heals you incredibly well and it decreases the downtime on manta and ulti.

6472379,0,t1_czopc68,Flak cannon is one of the best scaling spells in the game. Unlike Medusas Splitshot or Lunas Glaives Flak Cannon does not reduce damage nor has a limit on the amount of targets it can hit. So that is  attacks that hit every target within AoE for the full damage of Gyrocopters right click damage which becomes pretty large lategame. For Illusion heroes like Phantom Lancer or Terrorblade this just simply means they cannot use any illusions as long as Flak Cannon is up.Rocket Barrage and Calldown are two of the best nukes in the earlymid game so Gyrocopter can also contribute a lot to early game fighting. Downsides of the hero is that Homing Missile is a pretty bad initiation tool although still quite annoying and the hero loses out to kiting carries such as Morphling Antimage and Spectre who can just play around Flak CannonCall Down AoE and cooldown. ,learndota2,czosfiz,5,t5_2tta4

If you plan on playing a lot of mid youre going to want to learn how to play him regardless. He is one of those mids you just have to know how to play.

Kill the squishy weak carry as much as possible. Most offlaners are pretty strong early game especially if you have a pair with you. Dont be too afraid to dive tower but dont overextend and give your opponents the kill gold instead. Roam and gank help your mid and your carry on the other lane. Always have TP ready.Meanwhile in higher backet offlane or when they do a  formation Soak as much exp as possible. If you cant last hit at least try to deny. If you cant even leave tower then just get the exp. Dont die. At all. Farm the offlane hard camp as much as possible when theyre pulling their creeps.,learndota2,d05lgrn,1,t5_2tta4

6636334,0,t3_46j3rj,A few words on the item buildI personally dont think you should rush Bloodstone on Death Prophet especially as Euls Scepter and Octarine Core are great on her to keep her alive. Maybe if you snowball super hard or something you can go into a fast Bloodstone but I think you pretty much always need to itemise for optimal survivability on this hero.This is probably too advanced for someone with ten games but let me tell you how I think when playing DP in this game the enemy have a lot of rightclick damage but not much magical damage. Thus Ghost Scepter becomes incredibly potent because it makes you immune to Physical Damage for some time. Shivas Guard is very good against normal rightclick as well and a great pickup on Death Prophet. When you can get a feel for the damage output from looking at the enemy hero lineup like this you should consider their main damage output and itemise accordingly. For example heroes like Zeus Lich and Lion pretty much only have magical damage but heroes like Chaos Knight Sven and Sniper get their main damage from physical damage rightclicks. Itemising with this in mind will keep you alive alot longer which is the most important aspect of a hero like Death Prophet. If you just stall long enough while your ultimate is eating throguh the enemy youll be doing a lot. Your item build should reflect this intention.So even if Bloodstone is okay I try to avoid building an okay item because if I consider other items I will most likely come up with something good or even amazing for this particular match. That being said your experience is limited. If you want an item build to default to on Death Prophet in the beginning it should probably be Euls Scepter and Octarine Core rather than Bloodstone.When you get more advanced you need to think like this and adapt your item build. This is generally true in Dota.,learndota2,d05r57f,1,t5_2tta4

I just wanna vouch for this advice. Its spot on.And its especially important to those newer players out there that I see in this subreddit that are just too damn nice or honorable to be playing a game like dota and dont believe in their ability to carry a team playing the selfish hero just try it honestly youll laugh at how scared you were when you figure out just how easy it is. Warning You will lose all respect for other people that pick these heroes at your current MMR. They are at that MMR despite picking these easy heroes for a reason.The only thing I think is more myth than truth is the very popular advice to take a break after losing games of dota. Im sure for some people this might be good but for a lot of people like myself I can quite easily lose  games in a row and then win  in a row without stopping at any point. I guess it comes down to knowing yourself if you ARE tilting then take a break but dont just assume youre on tilt because you lost a few games. ,learndota2,d0c09vk,6,t5_2tta4
6699941,0,t1_d0c8w0z,It is kind of a matter of semantics in this case but its good to understand how the mechanics actually work because there can sometimes be some strange interactions.  End result the target does take additional damage but outgoing damage from Necros ult does not increase.Ether Blast is the same as Decrepify and Ghost Scepter.  It works by reducing the targets magic resistance.  This increases incoming damage to the target not outgoing damage from your ability.Quick calculation as an exampleA hero has lost  HP.  Necro hits him with a level  ult no aghs. lost health  . multiplier    Outgoing Damage damage    . magic resistance   total damage actually dealt to targetMultiple sources of magic resistance stack multiplicatively.  Since base magic damage is  we multiply that by  from ether blast to get a new total of  actual damage.The actual formula  .    thats a damage increase of  but necros damage output is still .,learndota2,d0cbykg,2,t5_2tta4

A lot of my kills were catching someone singly or when the enemy team would try to splitpush us back and I would kill them on our side.Ive tried to go maxing out more damage to regen in my starting items and that is a mistake I shouldnt do anymore.This was really helpful so thanks again!,learndota2,d0co0ip,1,t5_2tta4
6708067,0,t3_47imuf,The best way to learn any specific skill like that is to give it your main focus in games. So just play normally but remind yourself to for example look at the minimap after every  last hits or to check for their supports every s to see if they are rotating or to see if mid is still in his lane every s or whatever you come up with. Eventually it will become natural.If you cant remember to do it then you need to focus more. Even if you miss last hits or kills or your other dota abilities get worse you need to make sure youre achieving your goal for this game.,learndota2,d0d66pz,1,t5_2tta4

6715914,0,t3_47m6yh,It does give good stats youre right there. However the evasion part of the item which is often times the most important one rarely matters as PA because your enemies will usually buy MKB anyway. So ignoring the evasion what you get from Butterfly is  Agility  Damage and  Attack Speed as well as an active. While that may look good Butterfly almost costs  gold. You need to look at what other expensive items give you.Assault Cuirass gives you about  more armour about the same attack speed  less damage but it also gives a really good aura  AS and  armour to your team  armour to enemy team. Its buildup is also better and it costs less. Oh and dont underestimate the negative armour its really significant and sometimes it will give you more damage than  per hit.Abyssal Blade is very important on PA because one of your biggest weaknesses later on is how easily you can be kited. What you pretty much have to do in a lot of games is to use BKB Blink strike and Abyssal their carry and kill them as quickly as possible. The Bash is also great of course and this item is pretty much a must for PA in the late game.Satanic is very good for sustaining. Without it you can easily be nuked down very quickly but with it you can pop the active Blink Strike someone and often times go to full health very quickly.Id say that Butterfly is really only good when youre already ahead. Like if they cant afford MKBs and youre not weak to nukes then Butterfly can be good to close the game out I suppose. But in general its an item you want to avoid because without the evasion there are other items that just offer so much more.,learndota2,d0dzf46,1,t5_2tta4

I generally can get a Radiance under  minutes or shortly after  and it hugely depends on if you get kills or deaths under your belt and how many towers you eat. But you also gotta save up as much gold as possible. Mostly I wont buy boots for my bear until I got Midas but I wont finish those until I got Radiance  gold saved. Boots on the druid should be bought early but I generally stay with brown boots. Before Midas Druid Tango  Healing Salve BootsBear Quelling Blade maybe stout maybe Ring of Protection Orb of VenomAfter Midas I get boots on bear and a Basilius and then you farm farm farmAlso get a tp. Often the first lane I eat is mid. After you got lvl  and you see their mid pop up at your safelane instant tp to mid and eat the tower. Getting the last hit on a tower helps so much. Generally their safelanetower is hardest to push so you might just tp and push their offlane.As Lone Druid you need  mins of good space and avoid fights as a general rule but you have good kill potential with an ally as of lvl  and kills are good gold. If it looks like a safe kill gt get it if there is a remote possibility of dieing a gruesome death gt avoid. Definitely tp to an ally getting dived by .,learndota2,d0hthyl,3,t5_2tta4

6865269,0,t3_49sdty,I watched almost the whole replay. It is hard to pinpoint your exact problem because there is so many. First you die  times during the laning stage to mid Juggernaut and each of those deaths were preventable. Twice you go in when you have no way of killing him and just feed to his spin. Once you die under your tower because you run away from your own creep wave that is protecting you from his omnislash. Similar mistakes continue throughout the game. Your remnant use is very very poor. You do not use your remnants often enough to chase people and you dont use them to get full effectiveness from your bottle. You die at least  times in the game because you do not have an active remnant placed and at least  times because you do not swap your Treads to int. There is also a very amusing situation at about  minutes in or so. Where you dodge juggernaut towards the top rune but he goes for Lion instead of you. I thought you would for sure bottle the  minutes rune but instead you see the rune and run away. You leave DD at the rune spot and run with almost no hp and mana to kill jugger. You chase him to your Secret Shop and get Omnid there and both you and Lion die. With that rune you would have had mana for remnant and you would have gotten that kill for sure.I think you might have managed to win with that much feeding if your item choices were better. Manta style would have saved you  times in that game for example you would not have died near their rax in the end. The death that forces you to buyback and then die again. Manta Style would have also gotten you quite a few kills because you had to stand and do nothing during Silencer ultis. Some basic suggestions. Carry a TP scroll and use your remnants to fill your bottle. . Focus on your last hitting in lane.  last hits at  minutes in is not good.. Learn to use your remnants. Carry TP scrolls. Get your Travels earlier they are super good on Ember.. Use your Fire Shield more. Learn to use and build defensive items against silences. Carry TP scrolls,learndota2,d0uhlte,6,t5_2tta4

6888356,0,t1_d0x3jdl,I dont think this is true at all. Its extremely normal to continue getting better at anything as you put more time into it.Its fine to play a game and not care about getting better but its also fine and completely realistic to want to get better. At an MMR like .k the things we are doing wrong are still pretty prominent and fixable. I think most people who are willing to improve and have enough time to put into the game shouldnt be worrying about their potential skill ceiling until at least like k because up to that point the mechanical skills and decision making you need to continue improving should be simple to identify and relatively simple with time to learn.I think its silly to make an MMR sound good by comparison with the masses. To borrow an analogy I saw somewhere else if you have passed a basic calculus course you are already in the top  of mathematicians in the world. That doesnt mean passing that course was a meaningful or difficult achievement or that you have maxed out on your potential to improve at maths. Comparison with the top is always more valid than comparison with the bottom imo. If nothing else its just sad to tell yourself Im normal I can never be the best. You sure as hell wont ever be the best at anything with that attitude.

The damage  you get is nice the range though..... It doesnt increase the range of the kick itself by . What it does is increasing the lenght from where the stone can be kicked according to your heros postition to the stone. This can actually save and enemy if you place the stone abit off them in close combat as the kick will not be from your hero and he can escape the stun if he stands between the stone and the hero due to increased CAST range of the kick.

This means that most of the time you will apply the skadi debuff but of the time it will cause chain lightning instead. This is the same for maelstrommjollnir with all other UAMs. There are further strange UAM interactions for example skadi does stack with lifesteal.

Only thing to be aware of is not to split the creepwave but if you cant even get last hit you actually want to spam A on enemy heroes to get creeps as far as you manage to.When playing hero with summons you can pull creepwave by them to your tower. You can do it by yourself but you will be out of position then and really easy to be killed.If youre ranged or tanky  have a lot regen and cant get any last hit focus more on denying. When creeps get under  just spam A  even when enemies get the last hit. Youre just ensuring creepwave is pushing.,learndota2,d12odpq,1,t5_2tta4

Radiant was like  LHs vs.  LHs of Dire. Its  LH difference  Its actually more than your farm and slarks combined. Sven had k gold just from LHs while lost .k with deaths. This lead him for a min BkB and just because he was dumb IMO to start a cristalys before. All game long the only hero in your team who was ahead Sven was a squishy SF and the difference between both was never thaaaat much. i think they were always like  SF kills from victory in a team with a lot of lock downs and stuns.Yeah maybe your team really sucked but Hard Carries have hard in their names for a reason.

6942631,0,t3_4argm8,Its very critical that you are good at last hitting as a support so that when you have a chance to farm a free lane you maximize your gold. Another tip is being patient. If you watch pro games supports are sometimes literally standing around in the trees just waiting. They might be level  and everyone else is like  or something but they wait. When the chance to get the kill in the team fight comes they jump in and make the kill happen and get the gold. Sometimes as a support its ok to do nothing if it means patiently waiting for  seconds to successfully gank an enemy. Its that OH SHIT moment when the enemy picks a fight and then  seconds later a Fissure block slams in and they are stunned trapped and helpless because they get baited out. ,learndota2,d139z34,2,t5_2tta4

7092294,0,t3_4cp9sb,I really like the OoV harass with heartstopper thats a great idea. I also think Blademail is a nice early item too might try this out.But after that Im not convinced. If youre going for Skadi why not get treads for the HP and AS? If you want MS I think drums would be an excellent item instead. Survivability mana pool and team speed boost. You need a HP stepping stone from blademail to Skadi otherwise youll get melted and the enemy will still be at . I dont think Id ever skip Aghs on Necro. It is seriously gamewinning. Its also another decent HP boost for price. Treads drums and Aghs with Blademail is easy money and will make you pretty unstoppable midgame. Late game it becomes very situational. Do you need more  survivability against multiple cores? HeartOctarine. Do you just need to lock down that one carry? Hex. Is the physical damage too high? Shivas.

But just because you know something is good it doesnt mean you can utilize something I am NOT implying that you are bad at the game. I can speak only from my experience. I also watched alot of Pro games so I see them often using smokes for example. So smokes are good is the obvious conclusion. But when you use it at wrong times or with the false heros this item can be much less efficient. I only slowly realized how to use this item correctly. And I feel like this is the reason people at lower skill dont buy smokeswards. Not because they think the item is bad. Its because the cant use it efficiently. And also this is the reason the support role is very underrated in low mmr. You buy wards gt your team cant use the vision efficiently. You make space for your carry gt they dont farm efficiently. Also on the other side there are alot of supports that dont know what they are doing.TLDR knowing somthing is good doesnt mean you can utilize it efficiently. ,learndota2,d1rxcae,7,t5_2tta4

7287759,0,t1_d26judw,It would depend on your team lineup as well as the other team.    If you canneed to gank early then take mid to get a quicker level  and use the runes to gank.   If you dont need to gank your team can at least pull even in all lanes and you have a good support backing you up then safe lane is the way to go. Youll get safer farm and have bigger items quicker.  Overall safe lane is probably better but if you feel the game would go better from a few good ganks take ember mid and use the level advantage to help out your other lanes. ,learndota2,d26ki6s,1,t5_2tta4

7296398,0,t1_d1zn496,I personally play earthshaker at pos and I agree that no one plays support in low pub games xD which is why when I was fairly new to the game I was the one who usually picked the support. I think pos earthshaker would do really well and hes not really that greedy and he doesnt rely on farm to do well but to be an effective ES you do need a blink dagger. An ES without farm can still be a great initiator but with good positioning. Hes my goto guy just because in pubs theres rarely a person who picks a support or a stunner and with Earthshaker we get both. If you really want to play at pos I recommend playing as CM. She does really well but I know that she does better at certain lineups which takes advantage of her skillset and with heroes who have low mana pools who takes advantage of her passive Arcane Aura. Out of all the supports i think WD is the funnest to play as great voice acting D but what I dont like about him is hes easily countered by heroes with stuns like Earthshaker xD as his ult is channeled which means you need magic immunity which can be acquired from BKB or from Omniknights Repel.Finally the game of Dota is really complex and many heroes can be played in different ways and its up to you which hero you are comfortable playing as. Because at the end of the day its all about preference. Try experimenting with different heroes and see what suits you. Also Dota is a team game and suggest heroes to your teammates that would do well with the hero you would like to pick. Try other game modes as well besides all pick like Captains mode so that the hero lineups are overall better depends on the captain though. ,learndota2,d27jua3,1,t5_2tta4

7312559,0,t3_4fjkdo,Well  i say that i usually get around  cs at  minutes and it all comes down to simply last hitting. Lets think of a scenarioYou are mid against an opponentYou try to go for kills while he tries to farmYou will shut him down early but then it comes to a point where you have  kills and  last hits while he has  kills and  last hits which means that he will still have the advantageSo always and always go for last hitting instead of harrasing. For example most carries can farm a stack except spectre. Slark can go to the stack use dark pact go last hit on lane come back and use dark pact and so on. Sven has an AoE stun and cleave which is perfect for farming stacks also you will have a creep stacking the ancient camp but you will only start to farm that later.Gyro can use his ultimate and rocket barrage  flak cannon to farm stacks also stack the ancient camp with a creep and farm it later.These are all examples on how to get higher last hits just focus on creeps and thats it also buy a quelling blade.

We can also see Ursa or Lifestealer gets picked occasionally to lane against offlane or roaming Enchantress. You also mightve seen CM and Mirana got picked more often recently to oppose Enchantress and Chens army.As for Storm along with Clockwerk he used to get pick to shut down Sniper .. Sniper disease was basically a turtling late game comeback meta while for now were still developing deathball with a lot of skirmish.

If you leave it too late youll never catch up and then you dont get a block at all.The other thing to mind is the angle you go at. You want to stay ahead of the creeps so dont go directly sideways.

Once you have that you are already out of inventory slots bkbglimmer dagger wards boots tp wand If you sell the wand for a not that useful mid tier item your item progression is pretty much blocked. Either get BoT very expensive or sell that mid tier item again.Your team fight strength in the lategame solely comes from your ultimate neither drums nor euls improve it or help you land it in any way.

7552476,0,t1_d2zqrbn,Calling Blink more a playstyle item than a situational item sounds nice but I think its only true in situations xD in which you would consider buying another item for the same reasons as buying Blink.Aggressive blinks with a defensive remnant are very useful very often but its not the only thing Blink allows Ember to do.  Kiting heroes that rely on nondamaging gapclosers or those that deal magical damage but dont break Flame Guard dodging projectiles and spells with long animations and being efficient and inconspicuous with your movement around the map are all made possible by Blink.  You could think of it as a th remnant it cant zip you across the map but it has a much lower cooldown zero mana cost and zero travel time.Buying it before Battle Fury is very risky and thus very rare.  If it enables you to continue getting shit done great but it has to do that.  If it doesnt you wasted a lot of time and gold.  Chains Guard and Remnant can help you farm but they do so at the expense of being less ready to fight.  If you end up just farming with your preBattle Fury Blink you done fucked up.BoTs Battle Fury and Daedalus are the trifecta so you have  open slots which I generally fill with Blink LinkensBKBMantaSkadi defensive and MKBDaedalusRapier offensive.  Against lots of lockdown youll usually need more than one defensive item forcing you to ditch either the optional offensive item or Blink which really sucks.  Keeping Blink might be the better option but you can still say Blink isnt as good against heavy lockdown because of slot limitations.  This is especially true if youre your teams only source of physical DPS in which case you probably cant afford to give up the optional offensive item and have to forego Blink.  Singlecore Ember games against heavy lockdown are the worst so avoid them like the plague.Just like having Blink against heavy lockdown can be good but not as good as when not against heavy lockdown having it when behind might also be good just not as good as when youre not behind.  Its definitely probably not the time to buy it before Battle Fury but it may still be useful later.,learndota2,d30oihk,1,t5_2tta4

7707563,0,t1_d3i4itg,Well the problem w Urn is that youre again straying away from Rikis damage potential w agility based items. Honestly regarding the tower taking problem. What makes your team better than the others is your ability to make clear and good decisions. Not only does taking a tower provide a gold advantage but it prevents the enemy supports from traveling deeper into the map for the rest of the game! Outside walking but thats lame So its always important to take as many towers as possible. Furthermore its even MORE important to direct your team and not get inflated regarding your status as OP EZ CARRY. Just keep that in mind! Dota is an objective based game and not just about kills  To iterate on the BountySladar struggle. Honestly youre right in just avoiding when possible. Usually your ult can deter them when dusted and then you can follow up w a defensive blink strike to escape  Its a struggle but usually once you get Manta the game is over and their natural vision is destroyed ,learndota2,d3iar4p,1,t5_2tta4

If youre dazzle or omni you probably should stay back. It all boils down to how comfortable you are with who youre playing. so learn about your heros niche and play a lot of games then you should probably improve in your teamfighting skill.If youre asking about when to get into teamfights thats a whole different thing.Glhf fam. ,learndota2,d3kqdiv,1,t5_2tta4

7825443,0,t1_d3vkel6,I hate to just say it depends but none of those things are terribly uncommon. It depends on what you want to get done and what creeps you have.gt ... to a losing lane?If your mid has a bad matchup or you dont have kill potential with the creep you got and your mids skillset this is a common play whether the matchup is even or disadvantaged for your mid. The best two creeps for winning mid without actually ganking it are Harpy Stormcallers and Wildwing Rippers though this can also be done reasonably effectively with a Satyr Tormentor. There are situations where you might also send a similar creep to your offlane early in the game. This is a particular consideration if you are aggressive jungling have a greedier offlane hero want to keep the enemy supports from rotating off the lane or just need to put additional pressure on the enemy safelane farmer before it takes over the game.gt ... to contest a rune?Its somewhat common to send a creep to a rune spawn just before the rune is spawned using it to guard the rune until someone on your team can pick it up or to deny it if your team isnt going to get it. This can force enemy bottle carriers to bottlecrow.Part of what makes this somewhat common is that you can do it as part of using a creep to stack Ancients for your team which reduces downtime. Its not nearly as commonly done out of combination with remote stacking.gt ... to deny pulls etc.? When aggressive jungling absolutely. Much less after the early game because you dont want to feed creeps. Its also worth noting that you might also want to use a creep to pull enemy creeps sometimes to set up a push on the enemy safelane tier  or just to force the enemy safelaner to tank creeps or sacrifice farm.gt Are things like this what you should aim to do with your creeps instead of keeping them semiclose to you?  Which is kind of the preferred play?Not really instead of but in addition to. Its all situational if you get a good ganking creep early you probably want to solo smoke and wrap around behind the enemy mid or offlane or solo safelaner to set up a kill but sometimes you still dont have kill potential that way. Sometimes you need to sit back and focus on yourself so that you dont fall behind. You need to be able to constantly judge the best way to advantage your team on the fly to maximize the hero.,learndota2,d3vn9yd,1,t5_2tta4

7846954,0,t1_d3y0xrn,Both quelling blade and stout can be picked up at the side shop so unless theyre pushing the lane hard youll be able to grab one at some point.I like quelling on melee cores because its so cheap and accelerates your farm. Also if your opponents are good at denying then it can make the difference between getting a last hit and not. Once you get  extra last hits youve already paid for it. Dont forget that you can also upgrade it to an iron talon which really accelerates jungling.Tangoes  stout  quelling arent terrible starting items but it depends on how much you get harassed. Swapping the QB for a salve  branches is also an option.Also dont forget that once you level lifesteal you can just rightclick creeps to get some health back but this pushes the lane and puts you in danger. To pull the creeps back right click on an enemy hero and then deaggro the creeps just make sure you get out of their way before they hit you.,learndota2,d3y2eog,5,t5_2tta4

7910249,0,t1_d4565sl,Shut down the other midlaner. Counter pick their mid and deny everything. Im trying to hinder their team by basically making another player useless for the first  mins. After you get your first real item rotate around and try to take towers and pickoffs. Taking the mid tower solo is also extremely underated and idk why its not mentioned more. If I play Windranger or Invoker and their mid leaves for a gank or something Im pushing their mid tower for free gold and a huge advantage. I like getting my first good item like drums on Invoker and then communicating with my team to take bottom or top. Their mid should be worse off and less farmed if I did well in lane and I can usually give myself and my team a very nice advantage. After youve taken tier ones farm and look for a rosh opportunity getting a pick off to help set up for it. After this relentless aggression and you can end the game sub  mins. Also if someone gives you the el classico mid no gank noob mute them and play your game. During the first  mins your job is to win your lane. Let the other lanes worry about themselves for the most part. If Im Invoker and decide to gank  mins in and fuck up and die then my last hits are hindered their mid got free farm and the lane I tried to gank is just worse off now.

8078674,0,t3_4ptfg2,Finally a hero I can sort of speak on! Brews normal skills are pretty straightforward. Ideally his perfect initiation is blink clap haze the enemy carry then ult. However if they have hexes orchids or instant silences silencer or Skywrath you may just have to settle for Blinkclaphazeult or even just blinkult. In terms of items I like to build him as an aura bitch. After boots blink you can go Shivas AC Vlads Aghs hexabyssal or halberd. If they have lots of stuns dont skip BKB. I wouldnt recommend playing him as a hard carry as I do not believe that Brewmaster is a real rightclick carry and is more useful in a utility role.As much as I hate to simplify what separates good Brew masters from great Brewmasters is how well they utilize the Storm Panda. When using his ultimate stick the Fire Panda on their squishiest hero and use the Earth Panda stun to break channels or simply wreak havoc. However the Storm Panda  is the trickiest for newcomers to use. Try and keep these things in mind when you are using it. Dispel Magic is essentially an AOE Purge. That means it can deal damage summons like Warlocks Golems but it wont instagib them as well as  dispelling invisibility from things like Templar Assassins meld and Sand Kings sandstorm. You can also use this to prematurely end your cyclone. Cyclone is probably the most straightforward aspect of the Storm Pandas kit and it is probably the most useful. I like to prioritize using it on healing Heroes like Omniknight Dazzle Phoenix and Necrophos. It can also be useful for isolating earlygame damage dealers like Axe and Viper or initiators like Earthshaker or Tide. Take an extra half second to figure out who is the best target and act accordingly. Wind Walk is a fantastic escape if things arent going right but dont just use it as an escape. Remember that it gives bonus damage when attacking to break invisiblity and if youre good you can use it  to  times every fight. It may not seem like much but it can add up. The priority for Brewlings in Brewmasters ult is EarthStormFire.  This is important for two reasons. First all auras Brewmaster is carrying will follow the Pandas in that order. If the Earth Panda dies the auras go to the Storm Panda and if it dies it goes to the Fire Panda. Second  Brewmaster always appears at the highest priority Panda after his ultimate is complete. Keep track of your Brewlings  make sure you wont be caught in a bad situation after Primal Split is done. Also remember that blink dagger will always be off cooldown after Primal Split  regardless of how much damage your pandas took. Use this to get out of potentially sticky situations with quick fingers.Against the right dual lane Brewmaster can still be good as an offlane hero but he probably still works best as a Tempo controlling mid.

It is not unheard of for offlaners to be completely zoned out and lvl   minutes into the game with  cs and no regen items left.The costbenefit of Iron Talon is just too good. You give the enemy safelaner free farm but you were not going to be able to contest it anyway if their supports do a good job of zoning you out and pulling camps. And you guarantee your own farmxp.When you go back to the lane you will probably be higher level than the enemy supports and can then hold your own.

8108235,0,t3_4q9d1v,If this happens in some of your games expect it. There are always some completely inept idiots who cant play as a team. If its happening in ALL of your games make sure youre not one. It should at least flip flop between you getting the idiots the other team getting the idiots or both teams having them. Work on communication skills. Figure out all the things you can ping and ping appropriately. Pings help overcome language barriers. Dont ping too much. Too many pings will just turn into ignored white noise especially to less skilled players who cant keep up with the mini map and their hero at the same time in the first place. Try to chat in hero pick. If anyone communicates back and isnt an asshole group up with them as much as you can in the game. Communicate with them and even if you arent laning together make it clear you want to rotate to them to gank or push if they help you notice when to do it. Focus on trying to bring them to your lane at the right time. Pick utility items that will work best for the two of you in tandem when filling out your item build. Two people working well together are more likely to attract the rest of the team trailing along after you in the team fight stage. Im not super high skilled either havent been playing that long but I put up decent stats on cores and ward really well on supports and lately I get a lot of friend requests after matches and I think its coming from the communication. Try to be active but not naggy with it. And stay as positive as you can with it.  As the other guy said play heroes that are hard to counter in low level pubs. Its the only way to not get pubstomped by them yourself. And expect most games to go late. If your team picks three offlaner type heroes and no hard carries the early coordination probably wont be good enough to win early and you will end up losing a painful  minute game. ,learndota2,d4rfsk2,5,t5_2tta4

8145681,0,t1_d4vn351,Lets consider the Solo Medusa vs SvenLion lane as an exercise in how to approach these kind of matchups for the OP. The obvious threat is chain stuns so Medusa needs to constantly position herself to be not in range of either stun. Pull creep aggro onto your ranged creep where possible and ensure Lion takes some hits from the creeps if he aclicks you. Keep creeps between you and Lion. Watch Fierces video on zone control keep this in mind and try to hit them as much as you can when they back off. Mana drain is an annoyance but easily handled with positioning back out of range rengage as soon as it drops off. The first few levels is an exercise in not getting stunlocked. As soon as you hit   points in snake  in mana shield you can start spamming snake. Count the number of creeps when you are sure it will hit him cast it on the wave when he goes in for a LH. Storm Hammer takes a lot of mana if you can catch him on the first or subsequent bounces it hurts him a bunch mana and health. Keep an eye on his mana and on his items to look for a mango. If he has no mana and no mango he cant kill you. If the wave gets out of control far from your tower suck it up and go pull. Normally Sven will skill cleave eventually hell save the points if hes smart and wont if he isnt so you shouldnt need to worry about this too much. Medusa can do well in this matchup as long as she positions well manages aggro and uses snake effectively. ,learndota2,d4vr8vj,3,t5_2tta4

8164522,0,t3_4r2ftr,Playing support and raising your mmr is totally doable even at a low level. If Purge were to play support in .k he would certainly win. Support at low mmr is all about counter picking communicating and warding effectively.CommunicatingUse your mic. Youll win way more games if you talk rather than type. If your mid solo kills the opposing mid and you SAY nice job rather than chat wheel Well played! I can guarentee hell buy a ward or tome for you later on.Saying hey guys we have vision around their Top T lets go try to fight there is way more persuasive than typing it not to mention its also faster.Counter pickingYou cant open a game with first pick kotl and expect to win. I would argue that every hero in dota is viable except techies but some heroes are better than others. Unfortunately supports are expected to pick first and you should which makes counter picking hard but you can at least pick heroes that deter the enemy from picking the OP heroes while also making them better picks for your own team.Here is a list of the current flavour of the month heroes  and the respective supports that are good picks vs them and therefore good first picksSlarkdisruptor lion Lifestealersvenlegion commander treant winter wyvern bane vengelc and ls onlyTimbersaw disruptor lion baneTerrorblade lion winter wyvernInvoker hard to counter since he is so versitile and he farms fast bounty hunter riki he is easy to pressure with early gankersTinker venge disruptorI think thats all of them but I might have missed some. Also there are better players than I who can correct me if im wrong on any of those counters.Warding effectively This all depends on your hero composition and the items your team chose and also the enemies heroes and the items they chose. For example if you notice the enemy sven has an HotD you can check his ancients and if he has a creep ready to stack it you can get vision of the stack. Then you can tell your team that when sven starts to clear the ancients you should gank him and steal the stack. You now have an easy gameplan to follow.If you have orchid qop and legion on your team youre probably going to want to ward the enemy jungle so that they can gank togther.If you know you want to take rosh or push a tower in the near future deward all of the enemies wards and get your own up.If the enemy has a pudge youre going to need wards in your jungle at  mins when he hits level .Basically ward with a purpose its true that any wards are better than no wards but if you want to climb mmr you need to be better than that. Also Im not saying that the standard nooby river wardjungle ward is bad sometimes that could be exactly what your team needs.If youre able to communicate well you have good heroes due to smart picking and you are warding where you need to youll have no problem getting your team together and thus winning the game. Theres also desperation smokes thats a beacon that all players will flock to. And even if u dont find anyone you know where the enemy ISNT.,learndota2,d4y43ip,4,t5_2tta4

8180297,0,t3_4rcwr5,Having no regen is very very bad. Even if youre mid you want a pooled tango or two  Ill generally get a Wraith Band  branches and  pooled tangoes on mid Dusa. If youre safelane I would bring two sets of regen unless you have a nice defensive trilane. Running out of health early is way worse than getting your Aquila  gold later.You should buy boots before finishing Aquila. Not having boots can be a huge disadvantage in lane and if your opponents have boots then they can just run you down and kill you.You absolutely need Magic Wand on Medusa every game no exception.  Wand charges is an insane amount of EHP between actual health and Spell Shield.The casual Perseverance isnt good unless you know for a fact that youre going to need a Linkens which in most games you arent.Maelstrom doesnt do much for you because it will only proc on your primary arrow target and the DPS benefits arent great for the cost. I wouldnt recommend this item.Its a mistake to play Medusa as a hardfarming split pusher. You are an early fighting hero and can basically just man with your team at  minutes and be really strong. Never stop farming but you should join most if not all teamfights. TlDr Early Boots of Travel are bad.Basically on Medusa youve got two options for your early game core Treads and Mask of Madness or Phase Boots and a casual Yasha. I prefer the Phase Yasha build myself because youre never starved for mana but the DPS difference is negligible and the cost is about the same so its down to personal preference there. You should basically always buy Boots gt Aquila gt TreadsPhase gt Wand gt MoMYasha.From there I usually like to get Skadi into Butterfly and follow it up with straight damage MKB Daedalus Rapier. There are a lot of options for late game items including going double Butterfly tricky because you have to end the game before your opponents get MKBs BKB to ensure you literally never die and keep your rapiers safe et cetera but thats the general idea.Oh and dont upgrade your Yasha. Manta and SampY are both pretty bad items so after youve gotten rid of RoA and Wand in favor of bigger things you should sell Yasha.,learndota2,d5034m7,1,t5_2tta4
8181155,0,t1_d5022ru,I hate this advice. I float around .k and the number of people who think theyre below their real mmr and just need to spam mid to win is mind boggling. Ive lost more games because people were squabbling over who gets mid than I care to count.Case in point Last night I had a game where we already had a pudge pick mid. Our last pick refused to pick support and picked ember spirit and went mid. I would have picked support if Id known he would refuse but Id already picked LS to go with the Slark. Slark proceeds to get crushed with no support Im behind because I kept leaving my jungle to try and help him pudge doesnt get enough early levels to really be effective and offlane loses because theres no support to rotate and big surprise the mid never ganks any of the lanes. Oh and the best part the two supports on the other team omni and warlock proceed to be the best two players on the other team and shit all over us.Supports win games. In fact at lower mmr where the problem is usually low CS its often better to pick a good effective support who has game changing spells even without CS since you can have a huge effect on the game without needing to be great at last hitting.

8190238,0,t1_d518z7c,Not saying that. What I meant was in terms of what the heroes mean to the team if I run into a position  for any reason and I can trade my life for them Id consider that a solid trade for the team in a vacuum. Ive been running off a build that recommends Tranquils rather than Arcanes I assume for the added move speed but Arcanes make more sense because Ive been running low on mana a fair few times recently so Ill be doing that.

8193516,0,t1_d51plmg,Agreed.  I think I focused on defensive warding more because defense should be the st focus and bad supports cant seem to grasp that.  Once they do then offensive warding is just as important.To add to my first comment I think the other question these folks need to ask in general is just where is the action happening?  If youre winning fights and your team has momentum ward forward because thats where youll be going.  However if you cant even breach the river high ground without dying ward your side of the river and your jungle for defense.

If someone on your team is truly the scum of the earth there are creative ways which are actually fun and dont necessarily even mean you lose. Buy a force staff and use it on the guy who made your life miserable. Toss him with Tiny. Hook him into the trees. Use swap on them. Trap them in cogs. Chrono him. Trap him in your serpent wards. Sunder him when youre low. Decrepify him. Use Midas or Clinkz on the camps theyre about to farm.Really you can come back from anything in Dota.

8359272,0,t3_4u21he,Ive been playing lots of arc warden in . and have come to the conclusion that if your mid its probably best to avoid Dagoneblade. If youre playing position  or  youre team is going to need more from you than just a double Dagon. Yes that build will get you a fantastic KDA and you can probably pick off supports all game but you will eventually fall to the enemy cores who have built for substantial late game. What you want to be thinking is right click as you will still be dishing out huge damage but in a form that also lets you split push and take objectives. The two builds I use focus on push or gank. A good push item progression might be aquilagtmidasgtmaelstromgtBOTsgtMjollnirgtshadow bladegtdesomkbgt moonshard. While a good gank item progression might look like aquila gtmidas gtshadow bladeor silver edgegtBloodthorngtDiffusalgtMKB gtmoonshard. Of course zet can be built in many different ways but this is what I feel most comfortable doing as a mid or safelane. There is also the question if how to play th position arc warden which has a very different role than  or . For the majority of the early game until you get enough for say a blink and Dagon or a blink and Diffusal zet can bring insane sustain to the team in the form of mangos and urn charges. He is also a great hero to carry dust as it copys over to the double for infinite charges. Fill the role that you team needs from you. If you have the lock down go right click carry. If your team lacks lock down get a Diffusal or hex or orchid. If your team is doing fine without you go split push. If you already have too many cores support. And if they have lots of squishy heroes feel free to go dagon eblade. They are all viable and powerful item builds in the right situation you just have to get a feel for what works and what doesnt ,learndota2,d5mgm26,2,t5_2tta4

Drows early game DPS is extremely high and unlike other early game pushers DKDPPugna it is not reliant on a long cooldown or on mana. So you just push and push and push and then you win. You for some reason only have .k tower damage which is criminal in a drow game.Your items do not suit the game either in my opinion. MoM when dealing with Riki and QoP is gonna do more harm than good most of the time. You have a dragon lance but no hurricane pike. Hurricane pike is incredibly good on drow when facing lifestealer and riki. You can escape the smoke cloud or the open wounds. Youre facing omniknight youre an agility carry.

8397696,0,t3_4ukj18,Quick tips from personal experience Dont support until you reach .  Supports are useless in low skill games. Get a hard carry and outfarm everyone. Go for pickoffs and tower pushes once you have enough items Build TP boots when possible. People at then MMR rarely carry TP scrolls. If your team is ready for a team fight fight and then immediately go for a tower. Alternatively Spam Lycan by split pushing.I went from  to  spamming brood and then at  people are smart enough  man and shut down brood however you team is not smart enough to take the advantage of space created. Then I spammed Lycan until I reached  and remain there for eternity.I started playing Season ranked and calibrated at same . However my peak was  after which I went theough a steep decline . So I might get that MMR back in a few days.One thing I noticed is I have long streaks whether its winning or losing. I always have like  wins followed by  losses. I know its annoying and I usually uninstall dota for a few days.Another critical thing to not is your player behaviours score or secret MMR. This is really really crucial. Dont flame in the game. After  MMR people are generally OK unless your behaviour score is less than  then you get a lot of flamers or retards in your team.My behavior score at the moment is  and I shit you not the people I play with are worse than  MMR. But its all my fault. If I hadnt flamed in my previous games I would have not been reported and I would have had better team mates to play with.,learndota2,d5r9bul,3,t5_2tta4

8444509,0,t1_d5x2g5o,Great detailed reply would like to a make a general comment to add to this and answer the question of gtwhat can I do to improve my overall performance?What Matters Most? in no particular orderCandidates Decision Making    MovementFarm Routeswho to target in fightswhere to farm etc... Itemisation Knowledge of SpellsInteractionsHeroesItems XPMGPM Teamwork PushingSplitpushingThese are just a few of the main topics that are important in every skill bracket.Lets have a look at what is most important to improve at .Kmmr Decision Making  This is a skill that comes with time and practise. It is very hard to teach or seek to learn how to make a decision since every situation is different. You can however try to narrow down the most important factors in any particular game and use this knowledge to make an informed decision in that situation.    Important Factors      Team Composition      EnemyFriendly Items      What Hero am I playing? What Items to I have?      What is my purpose in the game? Team Composition If they have a particularly tanky lineup you will need to consider buying more damaging items. If they have huge Psychical Right Click damage you will require Armor or Evasion. This thought process is simple but choosing the right items takes a bit of time and some knowledge of the differences between some items. EnemyFriendly Items Do they have a Mech? Do they have a Pipe? Do we have a Vlads? Do we have a Assault Cuirass? This knowledge changes how you play and how risky you can be in fights. What Hero am I playing? Well you should know D But the idea here is that you need a coherent idea of what your capabilities are in any given fight. If you are an initiator  you need to initiate if you are the main damage dealer you need to ensure you take out high priority targets that are disabled particularly since you will do it the fastest. What is my purpose in the game? Dont get to philosophical about this one I simply mean that you must understand the role you play be it jungleofflanemid and build accordingly and play accordingly to match the role and fit around your team. All of these factors contribute to how you choose where to...gtMovementwho to target in fightswhere to farmwhat items to get etc...What you need to do is to keep juggling between the sources of information available to make decisions and the decisions themselves. With up to date knowledge of the game around you an informed decision will come naturally. Itemisation  This is highly dependant on    Your Hero    Enemy Team composition    Where you laneyour purpose of your roleWith enough practise you can very quickly pick  items that are going to be beneficial becoming fast is a skill that takes time so for now if you are slow go back to the decision making process aboveIn short Do they have high Physical Damage  Get ArmorEvasionDmg Block Do they have high Magical DamageStuns  Get BKBLinkensHeartHP items Do they have good invisible Gankers?  Get a pair of WardsGem dust doesnt work since they are invisible to Initate not to Escape Do they have good PushDefence  get Sustainability MechVlads are given DrumsPipeBasiACUrnForce StaffBlinkMana Boots etc...Thinking about strengths and weaknesses lets you quickly make once again an informed item choice based off the information you can quickly glean by glancing at their team. Knowledge of SpellsInteractionsHeroesItemsThis comes with time but is very handy if you spend the time to either research each HeroItem in depth a little more or go out of your way to try the All Hero Challenge to make sure you have good knowledge of all Heroes. XPMGPMOnce again over time this will improve you can however quickly improve your ability by practising in Hard or better Bots in Mid. Or trying the Arcade Games such as the Last Hit Challenge Game.  Minutes of this before playing games a day can vastly improve your accuracyCS. The harder the better.Solidifying your Farm Routes within the Map can also prove useful so this includes utilising your Mana on Blink Heroes or farming with Spell Usage as well as remember to cut quick paths to new camps and Stacking when possible. TeamworkThis can come in the form of collaboration or Team Itemisation. If you think you are ahead of the people in your game  try to take the lead. Just remember to be nice and try to coerce them into a good mood.If you can suggest someone has good farm and so maybe you could get the Vlads? and Ill get a Pipe to deal with the Invoker and Lion on their team then you stand a good chance of having those two items ready for the next fight. Although comms can often be toxic in Pubs it is there for a reason and it is worth using to further your advantage in the game. PushingSplitpushing  the ONLY way to winSimply keep in mind  if you can Push it is usually good to do so.If you win a fight taking out  and you lose only  you can Push and you should Push. So many times in low level people will be sitting back or going RoshanFarming when they could just end the amp game. This is particularly important if the fights are close but you are winning them and they have better late game potential through Hard Carries or multiple Cores.If you are behind or have the capability to Split Push often this causes members of their team to come back to the Tower and try to Defend opening up opportunities as they are either split or  and  and not  for you to quickly TP out and go farmroshpush as  on the other side of the map.How important is each of these?Candidates Decision Making    MovementFarm Routeswho to target in fightswhere to farm etc... Itemisation Knowledge of SpellsInteractionsHeroesItems XPMGPM Teamwork PushingSplitpushingAt .K level these are my reccomendations as to how much of your timeeffort you should put into each factor during a game. If you wish to practise a specific part then you need to be fully  focused on that task. Decision Making   Effort Itemisation   Effort XPMGPM   Effort Teamwork   Effort PushingSplitpushing   EffortReasoning Decision Making  Affects all aspects of gameplay you need to be looking at this a lot. Itemisation  This matters but what matters more is how you play if you have basic core items and an idea of what to get next that is fine for your level. XPMGPM  a Whopping  here I believe a good XPMGPM gives you a significant lead and with this you will have more confidence in fights more survivabiltiy and probably  more items than most friendlyenemy units. Teamwork  screw teamwork at .K the thing is if your team is clearly working together you just need to be the glue  stay positive and provide a little idea here or then on what to do  build this move here can we go Rosh? This doesnt take much of your time. PushingSplitpushing   as before this wins games so you need to focus on when it is possible to do so and grab the chance before it is too late.Ok! Hope this helps out a bit if nothing else you can refer to some of this for information if you want to have a bit of a broad overview of what do dowhen. Just try to hold some of the key points in mind in game and hopefully that should be enough to set you on the right path!,learndota2,d5x3o3q,3,t5_2tta4

8497487,0,t3_4w23at,He cant really be effective as a right clicker with his agility gain and there are better heroes that can right click if thats what youre after. He is fine when he goes the nuker build but again I feel like there are better heroes too tinker makes better use of the mid lane and is more likely to win it for example. Also see nyx in the offlane linaqop mid.. You used to be able to build whatever you wanted on him because his utility and ult damage made him strong not the items so you could go something like armlet into basher and MoM. Both his utility the ability to pull allies long range stun attack speed slow on roll impact and his ult damage can be purged duration nerf got nerfed so hard since these days that he needs to build items to get them back and even then they arent close to what he used to do given a tiny exp lead for the first  minutes. He is a good CCinitiation hero for organized teams that can utilize those to the maximum and he has big utility with blink aghs and force staff. But the ult damage is situational and his nukes are negligible and dont allow the massive amounts of damage you used to be able to dish. Youre just a long range initiator with shit laning no farm mechanisms You dont really want to spend stones on creeps long cd ult and Eblade dagon basically. It works sometimes but Meh.

However these heroes have a tendancy to build items in order to counter most silences BKB Manta Euls and Slark really need some stat items in order to be effective.

8511583,0,t3_4w9nyi,In competitive games vision plays a far bigger role than in pub games which takes the element of surprise which is what a Pudge thrives on out of the game. In general the map is warded much better to spot out rotations which is why pro players have to smoke in order to pull ganks off..So a pudge would have to smoke to get his solo kills. The problem with this is that you are using up all your teams smokes to get solo kills which leaves you with no smokes in the mid game when your team actually wants to smoke as a team to get objectives.gt over the enemy carries my repeatedly killing themThis doesnt happen in competitive games. Carries are often baby sat and tp rotations are very common making this highly difficult.gt snowball very easily because of his early game prescenseIf he gets a great early game yes youre right he can snowball pretty well however that great early game rarely happens.gt He can easily punish enemys are just slightly out of positionAnother issue that is very common in pubs but not in pro games.

8512218,0,t3_4wb0f5,I posted something in TrueDota not too long ago on this heres my thoughtsBig Dirge fan here by far my most played hero.Unfortunately I have not played him much as of the latest couple of patches mainly because he really isnt as effective as he used to be. The nerfs to Tombstone are somewhat related to that but I think that because he was so strong a few patches ago players in general have more awareness of how strong Tombstone can be in lane. When I throw down Tombstone now it is much more likely that my opponents will just run or kill it quickly.The biggest thing about Undying is past  minutes his effectiveness drops hes a horrible farmer and his skills drop off in effectiveness. He is in my opinion the opposite of a carry in that regard. Because of that he NEEDS to have a strong early game more so than most other heroes. Other offlaners can do well with just getting exp but he needs exp AND kills. He needs to be paired with a strong laning partner that can help him get early kills. If he doesnt hes effectively a waste of a position on your team. So items like OOV and medallion can be great to pick up on him early. Dive under towers if you need to to secure kills. Hold off on placing Tombstone right away sometimes its better to bait the enemy into thinking they are about to get a kill on you before you turn the tables by placing Tombstone and healing yourself. If the enemy has an ally TP in to assist you can even get a double kill and if you die in the process of that its worth it. Remember that you can use soul rip on your tombstone and sometimes that heal is the difference between a failed attack and a kill.Arcanemekpipe etc is a solid safe way to play him that will benefit the rest of your team late game when he starts to drop off. There are two items that I think can really help him continue to be aggressive in lane Atos and Euls. You have to get them earlyish though because they rely on your tombstone still being effective. If people try to run from it you can pin them in place with Atos. It helps you land a few more decays and keep you close to Flesh Golem aura. With Euls if someone attempts to attack your Tombstone or run you can lift them and zombies will spawn while they are lifted not as effective as Atos though lift time is . secs and zombie spawn interval is . Aghs is also great and Shivas is wonderful if you can reach it.A funweird build I used to run get early basilius break it down into tranquils and sage mask pick up a void stone and get euls asap this will help with mana regen. Then go Atos which gives him more health and a bigger mana pool and take it from there. Its not the most effective one to run but I had a lot of fun with it.TLDR Dirge needs to have a strong early game in order to help team later and this means coordinating kills with your lane partner  midlaner. Atos and sometimes Euls are strong pickups and Aghs and Shivas are awesome late game IF you can farm them,learndota2,d65l24l,2,t5_2tta4

Only move out if you can get trade kill TPing against those who dove tower. If you arent sureyou arent that far behind dont do it. When you say you have nothing to do you have to  know what your hero can do at that point.

Only important to right click cores no sort of evasion prevents magic nukes.

Useful similar to the Blink Dagger for initiation but many people forget invisibility is not invincibility.Sorry this isnt too helpful but if you have a question on a specific item then maybe I can expand to that.

8656452,0,t1_d6nin30,Unfortunately picking in Dota is really complicated so I cant give you a hard answer. It really depends on what picks are shown from both teams which translates into what your team is good attrying to do vs what their team is good attrying to do. What youre talking about doing is making a pick with the intent of winning a lane. Sometimes that can be a really good idea but if they lane that hero somewhere else pretty likely with timber since he was played in all  lanes at TI or your team needs you to be rotating either to gank or counter gank then maybe picking a counter for the lane doesnt really matter that much. The best I can do is address the specific example of picking to counter an offlaner. It honestly isnt that great right now because if a lane is too hard the offlaner can just rotate into the jungle with an iron talon which is why you dont see many trilanes this patch. In the case of Lion and Skywrath I dont pick Lion to zone offlaners. Hes actually pretty terrible at it with his low move speed and he isnt that great at trading hits. Usually he needs a nd support to zone an offlaner or the offlaner has to be pretty bad or just not a good offlane hero. Sky is really good at it but I usually look for silence to be really useful or for there to be some lock down for me to pair with his ultimate chronosphere ravage duel fiends grip. ,learndota2,d6no6uv,2,t5_2tta4

It can be solved with diffusal which also provides extra damage but thats another k gold if you need to fight soon.If chasing isnt an issue manta is by far the better item dispel dodge split push extra damage scouting compared to sny but if you need tankiness and chasing power for a small amount of money SnY is the way to go.Otherwise you can opt for a basher to chase builds into abyssal late game a manta diffusal a yasha gt diffusal gt manta if you are fine with mediocre hp or just go straight to late game items like a skadi or butterfly if you feel those are good choices.,learndota2,d70xoai,1,t5_2tta4

8784190,0,t3_50fhqm,Dont really know about pros or streamers to nominate but I say what I know. Im k player.When you pick OD you dont really want to be in the middle of the fight. You are pretty squishy if you get stunned or silence but if someone can tank for you you can make a ton of damage. During laning phase you take enemys intelligence which means heshe doesnt have as much mana as usually.Highly recommended items Bottle midlane can be also Aquila if you dont need hp regen Dragon lance into Hurricane pike BKB Scythe Drums Treads Shiva.Situational items Aquila Midas Euls Veil Atos Linken Orchid Bloodthorn Moon shard.How you should skill build OD?I would almost everytime start with Arcane orb but Astral can be decent also passive doesnt really do anything since you dont have spells to cast teammates might have but who cares D. I wouldnt use Orb that much before you get passive at lvl  but sometimes its useful. If you dont need Astral for defensive or aggressive plays read ganks you shouldnt skill it at all. During laning v Astral doesnt really do much especially against ranged heroes because range of the Astral is so small when its lvl . Usually I have     skill build when Im lvl  but it can be also     or     or something like    . Most of the matches you should max passive first or at least take  points before you start maxing others. Without mana pool OD wont do shit. Mana pool  damage. Also max Astral last but remember that it doesnt mean its bad skill. Astral can be really game changing since you can save your teammates from Duels or Chronos etc. When to pick OD?OD is great against Void Medusa WK Morph Timber most of the str carrys and squishy supports.How you counter OD?Well like I said mana pool means damage. Well how Nyx sees it big mana pool means death to enemy. So biggest counter are Nyx Pugna Viper during laning KotL.,learndota2,d73p2sa,3,t5_2tta4

I would never rely on my enemies inability to be efficient with item slots to justify buying an item not designed to avoid physical attacks as a focal point of its worth. To add your second argument about good positioning is a counterpoint to the suggestion of Glimmer Cape because of good positioning you defeat the value of Glimmer Cape over Ghost Scepter Force Staff or Euls Scepter.gtAlso its not like ghost sceptre doesnt have its own counter. Diffusal blade is becoming more and more picked up even on nonillusion heroes.Diffusal Blade is a heavier investment with limited charges compared to Dust of Appearance g unlimited uses I wouldnt call them comparable counters whatsoever. To add after those charges Ghost Scepter still retains its value.To add my suggestion to avoid Physical attacks were both Force Staff or Ghost Scepter. Ghost Scepter is  gold with no mana cost whereas Glimmer Cape is g and harder to build up than Force Staff g. On top of that Force Staff offers key stats that Supports prefer over Glimmer Capes magic resistance useless vs. Physical damage and attack speed dependent usefulness on the supportgtAnyway theyre both great defensive items but i dont think its as simple as glimmer good vs magic and ghost better vs physical.Yes but not in this case of Force StaffGhost ScepterEuls Scepter vs. Glimmer Cape.,learndota2,d73zjb8,2,t5_2tta4

You can probably tell this by watching my games and seeing where I place my wards they tend to be  on the enemys side of the map. I like to zone like an asshole and then look for opportunities to gank mid later. I also dont play many purely defensive heroes anymore like Dazzle for example. I barely play him anymore. That said...yeah there are plenty of games that I have a bad start and get carried. Youre gonna win games where you performed poorly and lose games where you owned. It happens.

Mitigatereduce the damage you do take  buy yourself a StoutPMS YES you can get a PMS on a Sven or another melee strength hero. Its  extra armour and  attack speed in addition to the  damage block which is a huge amount at level . Ring of protection has lost a lot of value of Kate but still worth a mention also.. Bring plenty of regen  if you are expecting a hard lane bring plenty of regen with you. Your starting items might simply by Stout  tangos and a salve. Your next  items will slippers of agility for tour poor mans shield. Dont be afraid to carry more regen out to you either. Invest the g into another set of tangos or a salve all you have to do is make  last hits to make your money back thats  creep wave it would take you . minutes and a g tp to run back to base and TP in and youre going to miss out on g worth if last hits in this time.There are other tips like pulling aggro back onto your ranged creep so that it kills him faster and pushes the wave towards your tower for safer last hitting.

8902743,0,t3_527dpf,Its actually not too bad. When you play QE invoker you want forge spirits and cold snap queued up for lane control and easy harass if the enemy comes too close. You can invoke and cast sunstrike as necessary but generally itll be more valuable to have cold snap and forge spirits. If you also use it to he ally punish dives on you or someone with low armor like an alch. QW generally wants tornado EMP early on since ghost walk is still really slow at that point. Later on you can switch to ghost walk tornado once you move quickly.Midgame before ags on QE it depends. If youre farming you want forge spirits and maybe aclarity but if you bought a euls and want a pick off you want chaos meteor and sun strike queued up so you can cast both of them then invoke and cast deafening blast for the full combo.If you have trouble remembering spells you can try invokergame .com I think. Also has an app iirc to practice or just hop in a lobby and practice combos. Bot games can also work for this just keep in mind they dont move with any predictability and they usually dodge sun strike,learndota2,d7hzcde,4,t5_2tta4

I never try to determine if a game is won or lost at any point. Its frustrating if anything but you just play your best. In any case buying a few wards as a carry or core is fine and encouraged when supports think they are carries or whatever. You cant really dump all of your money into them like a support but having a few can help a lot. It also encourages others to buy wards too. Usually in this situation I ping We Need Wards and then say on mic something like hey listen Im going to buy some wards first because we need them but it would be nice if someone else helped because I need to buy next item still. USUALLY someone else buys wards right then and there. I will sometimes throw in a snarky ...because RUBIK wont by any I guess and sometimes manage to guilt them into buying wards.

9012876,0,t3_53ptt2,Lets take sven for example you will have about  mana at level  assuming no stat items like magic wand or something. If you used gods strength storm bolt and warcry in a fight you would be left with  mana meaning you would be unable to use another storm bolt in that fight. If you tread switched to int treads while using your three spells you would start with  mana instead thus leaving you with  mana afterwards . When you switch to strength treads after casting your spells the percent of your manapool will stay the same meaning that with treadswitching you will have  of your  base mana after strength treadswitching or  mana. This means that you could get a second stormbolt off in this fight if you treadswitched back to int treads when its off cooldown.In general the percentage of your health and manapool are conserved when treadswitching so cast spells on int treads healgain mana on agi treads and fight on strength treads. You may think its an insignificant difference but the difference between having a spell in a fight and not is huge and seriously affects the course of the game.People even drop items on the ground when healing bottling so that their regen puts them at a higher percentage.

Also that skill build is way too greedy.  Id recommend only  points in the aura.  So it might be something like  or  at level .  This gives more balance between farming and fighting.

9143183,0,t3_55j1yu,No. Did I mention no?Axe is an initiator. He needs to build Blink in order to kill enemies early and start snowballing before they get high damage items. Through the mid game he tanks up in order to survive those initiations and get multiple blink taunts off during a teamfight. He is a fight controller hero. He is strongest in the earlymid game because of his damage output from spin. His usefulness quickly dies after the enemies get some levels and are able to tank through spin and blademail damage. You dont need radiance burn to farm because you already have spin. What are you going to do with radiance? You spent a good  minutes farming that item but how do you expect to use it? Just run at them? All the points you put in your taunt will be useless because you have no way to catch up to them. You can have the same damage output and more impact at a much faster timing if you just built Blink Blademail from the start.You can try it out if you feel like it and learn what does or doesnt work about it.

9158042,0,t1_d8ciwde,Dude slark has atleast  annoying skills. Ganking slark is much more difficult than jugg. You must stun him when his purge just goes into cooldown. Ofcourse that is not a problem at higher mmrs. But if you fail to kill him when he is stunnedyou wont be able to kill him. He will turn on shadowdance and pounce into trees or he can just run away if you lose vision over him even for a sec. And he can spot wards.Not to mention that if you dont have AOE stunthen lategame will be v because he will kill your supports easily.  Only thing bad about slark is that if he has a shit early gamechances are that he will lose the game. But if you dont push and you give him space and time to farm his itemshe will win.Last but not the leastSpinTP looks pretty straight forward but there are so many bkb piercing ultimates. Slarks toolkit is much better than jugg. Jugg is newbie friendlyin the sense that understanding his skills is easy.

They dont buy the components if its not going in their inventory right away because they might want to change their planned purchase before they get the full amount needed to buy the item.For example they might have the  Gold needed for a Crystalys with a plan to buy a Daedalus. They dont buy it yet because they have limited space in their inventory. A few minutes later they have  Gold and notice that the enemy Juggernaut has bought a Butterfly so they change their plan to buy a Daedalus and instead opt for an MKB.,learndota2,d8hd5lj,6,t5_2tta4

9210825,0,t3_56i2ft,It depends a lot on their heroes. If it is a case we picked a bunch of random heroes and dual lanes is the best we could come up with you might be able to zone them but this still requires that the carry helps you. Something like a level  morphing isnt going to contribute anything.If you got another support with you should try to contest the lane while you are still all level  because they are going to get their level  before you and usually going from level  to  is quite a bit of a difference in terms of how strong a hero is.Assuming you cant fight them or even died trying to do so things get a bit more difficult. If you feel like by being there you can prevent them from diving your carry and you carry is able to get at least some farm out of the lane stick to him if that is not the case immediately move mid and try to win that lane. You might be able to force one of their offlaners to do the same. At that point you kind of have to accept that your carrys item timings are not going to be the best and hope that something like  minute am battlefurry is going to be good enough.,learndota2,d8jjha9,2,t5_2tta4

If you know where the ward is or get lucky with a sentry you can just deward their observer and if you need vision just plant an obs where you think its unlikely to get dewarded keeping in mind where you just dewarded their obs. If they need vision in your jungle they are going to spend their time getting more obs up anyway there isnt much point using up your observers just to bait the enemies to deward them since in the end it wont really cost them much more time and it wont cost them anything since theyll get their money back from dewarding your obs.If you do expect them to come just plant an obs where you think they wont catch it and pay attention to where the place their next ward. If you catch them doing it you can just deward them again. It costs them the same amount of time as the ward battles but you come out on top.

9409539,0,t3_59io0p,Well if you play mostly mid you can totally play Jugg mid. In fact its kind of the standard way to play him at higher mmr games.Edit just looked at some of your games on opendota you really need to work on your itemization. Bfury aghs maelmjolnir are kinda bad items. Bfury is situationally good because it lets you farm super fast but that really isnt playing to the strengths of the hero. Jugg peaks off midgame imo where he is really strong with Omni and respectable rightclicks. I play jugg a decent amount and my build is usually something like pms gt phase gt aquilla for early game. Just these items make you pretty scary in early fights so make sure you have a tp at all times Jugg is really REALLY strong in early fights so abuse that. Next up I usually go Yasha gt Diffusal gt Manta. Yasha is a pretty cheap item that keeps up your early prescense in fights and also speeds up your farming. Diffusal is so good on the hero. The active is great for chasing and purging alike and you can use it during omni if the enemy buys ghost scepters also gives great damage to boot. The manta followup gives you great defensive utility and also gives a stupid amount of DPS with Diffusal overall great for jugg.After this its pretty situational but I really love picking up a blink. It allows you to really easily jump on people and blow them up and also allows you to spiltpush more safely Btw Jugg is a really good pusher You can also blink during Omnislash or blink out right as it ends which makes for some pretty cool plays. Other good items include the likes of BasherAbyssal Skadi Butterfly Satanic MKB its all up to what you need that game.Hope this helps.,learndota2,d98q3zx,3,t5_2tta4

In the early game the part where you would debate stats over crit is when you are suffering from a low mana pool to be able to use all your skills even once in a single fight.  At level  Juggernaut has a base mana pool of . Assuming Level  Omnislash  Level  BladeFury  and Level X Healing Ward  that is  Mana. At level  you could have  points in stats and  in crit or  in crit and  in stats.    The difference between those two scenarios is   HP . HPs   Armor  damage  attack speed   Mana . MPs    With the extra  mana and a Ring of Aquila that puts you at  Mana which is just enough to use each spell once. Without those  extra stats youll be at  mana.

Die less it seems obvious but if youre dead youre not making gold and earning exp.  Lastly have a small hero pool of guys you feel comfortable with and play them more often.  The less you have to think about using your items and abilities is more time you can think about your next move and paying attention to the map.

If you can get chunked down  hp by melee creeps and a zeus auto then maybe your  damage per auto at minute  isnt gonna be quite as threatening in terms of harass.Increasing his str growth is the easiest and most intuitive way to solve his issues but if it were up to me Id probably give him armor steal on his aura instead of just armor reduction.

9946181,0,t3_5hy1s9,One further note The amount of gold  EXP available for mid does not change unless you consider the ancient camps most notably on Radiant. In that case itsMid GPM  XPMPrevious   New   Change .  .Of course this really only applies if you had a mid hero that would stack and clear ancient camps TA comes to mind and even then you were not going to take full advantage of that because You were not stacking ancients every minute on the minute and Even if you were you were not going to clear them no hero can clear a stack at  minutes or a stack at  minutes.So anyway the ancients spawning every  minutes probably does not affect your early game that much as a mid it was virtually impossible for you and your team to get the full farm from that anyway. However while the practical as opposed to theoretical GPMXPM difference may not be a lot in real game situations you now have to really be on top of your timing if your plan calls for stacking ancients and you get punished much harder for forgetting or messing up.,learndota2,db40gl7,2,t5_2tta4

I go  before lvl choosing hp and  forge spirit.In lane I still use forge  ss to last hit and buy myself raindrops  casual void stone for the mana sustain upgradable later to many situational items keeping brown boots for later travels and of course midas because of the xp gain increase.The new experience redistribution means you can hit your levels much faster and be online a lot quickerso it only makes sense for me to rush aghs in order to keep up with the xp gain.I think that  forge spirit is enough to transition to the jungle.

10024815,0,t1_dbe8icz,well I think something you could do right now to help you with the sort of mechanical skills needed in the laning phase would to go to the arcade and get the Last Hit Challenge you can chose basically any hero. This game increased my farm exponentially. Im unsure if it is updated for . but I dont see why it would take too long. What I like to do is when I logon I play  mins and  min session this gets me primed for a ranked. However when I started I did  min sessions until I felt comfortable I think it was  LH in the min. Not including denies.  Then I would play progressively harder bot matches until I was doing unfair bots and still getting about  cs in min consistantly. From there I just started kind of dominating mid at my MMR was .K iirc I gained about  mmr in what  seemed like overnight without much knowledge of ganking or anything. Untimately I decided to play support since my favorite part of dota is being active across the map early and winning the lanes for my team. Since I do this now when I play mid I understand when ganks are coming my way and can look at a lane and know if they are gankable or not.So I guess what Im tryin to say is you have to identify a problem before you can fix it work on it test it and then move to the next one. I suggest you continue to spam Storm and focus on the game of dota as a whole then those skills can translate to other heroes easily. Or if you dont want to spam just pick  heros you like mid and get confortable Sumail and Miracle were hero spammers like this when they were coming up. ,learndota2,dbe9eyx,1,t5_2tta4

It would be impossible to go over everything without writing a novel. The biggest new things in my opinion would be the new revamped UI the map changes which are fairly significant and the addition of talent trees on every hero. Get familiar with the first two especially the latter one will take time for  heroes. Have you ever used Dotabuff For troll warlord it says phase vlads SampY BKB and Shadow blade were the most popular items purchased this week. People also get Skadi Daedalus Satanic and the new SB upgrade Silver Edge as luxury late game items.

10193971,0,t3_5lvuom,For me there are  main reasons to use sentries. is the defensive sentry often with an observer if not near a tower e.g. jungle entrance. This protects your nearby heroes from ganks but its too much gold to do every lane. Pick  or  farming heroes and protect them. Aggressive sentry. Against invis heroes the best strategy is nearly always to group up and push. Invis heroes hate teamfighting early. So just push towers and put a sentry just out of tower range.When I play support against invis heroes I do not spam sentries I keep them on me and place them strategically. I also normally dont buy much dust. I try to get my cores to buy their own dust especially offlaners and with backpack that seems ok.

10210891,0,t3_5m5hzs,I think the new HoD is actually stronger on Drow than the old one. all stats is generally more useful on Drow than damage and armour. HP regen is generally better than lifesteal since it allows you to freely use your frost arrows in fights especially important now since youre forced to max arrows due to lack of stats of course it doesnt scale as well into the late game but in the early game its much better and you can still get a Satanic later on. The two auras also work well into Drows game plan which involves a lot of five man pushing. Finally the dominated creeps are much stronger now since they have more movespeed and stay alive longer thanks to the HP regen aura.,learndota2,dc1gn3y,1,t5_2tta4

10253218,0,t1_dc5wrfn,While I personally did not recommend urn or drums since I dont really like getting them myself as a rubick theyre not bad items. Urn is a pretty good item if no one else on your team is planning on building one providing mana regen and health to sustain pushes. I dont think I would typically build drums though but its not bad. IMO a better item to consider is the changed helm of dominator. The regen and stats it provides are quite beneficial as well as the attack speed if your team can utilize it not to mention yourself if you pick up that  dmg talent.Veil is not a very good item on rubick. Sure itll give your entire team more magic damage but any team that has high magic damage emphasis cores probably already has a carry that typically builds veil. Rubick himself has only one spell that can benefit from veil as well as the possibly stolen spells. Why not buy a aether lens in that case? It provides the regen youre looking for a larger mana pool which may allow you to get tranquils rather than arcane and provides a longer cast range allowing you find better positioning.For warding I would probably make sure to drop wards WHEN traveling with your team. That is make sure youre holding a ward so that when your team finally intrudes into the enemy teams usual rotation paths you can drop one there on the way. If you dont see the enemy team where you already have vision up theyre probably in areas you dont have vision up right? Theres no need to sacrifice yourself to try to place wards where you already know theyre likely to be unless you plan on contesting that area. Instead focus your attention and pressure to where you do have vision and deward where you think they may have placed wards or popular warding spots when its safe to do so when theyve rotated to where you have vision and you get pushed out.,learndota2,dc69bcs,1,t5_2tta4

The new Proximity Mines made this even more essential.Specific scenarios are difficult to describe in words so I made some examples for you. Maybe Ill post them as an individual post later or include them in my more extensive guide when that get finished...An added bonus for me is that most players havent practiced movement around trees and in juke spots in empty lobbys which I have. This means that I can use Quelling Blade to confuse enemies and get away during all stages of the game as long as Im within the proximity of an area with trees.,learndota2,dc76od8,1,t5_2tta4

10278731,0,t1_dc8jba4,This is  correct when people start buying detection from minute one it can be hard to get used to not having that get out of jail free card that invis is at lower MMR.In order to make that transition easier for you I would be very aware of what is in your opponents inventory. Look for dust sentries and observer wards in the the supports inventory and try to have a general idea when people place wards throughout the map.Slark would be a good hero to teach you where the enemy observer wards are because of his ultimate ability passive is lost when you are under the vision of the enemy.Side note unless you bought the sentries or are very close to an item  gold or so away let your support get the gold for the ward.

10307773,0,t3_5ni0dt,Reach has given some pretty solid advice. I will be giving some advice about QuasWex or QuasExort..Matchup is very important for choosing QuasWex or QuasExort build. Since Invoker is usually playing mid your decision to go QuasWex or QuasExort should not only be based on overall teams composition but the hero youll be facing mid. As a general rule if opponent mid is a INT hero without a skill to escape the TornadoEMP combo then QuasWex basically wins you the lane. If it is not a INT hero or it is INT hero with mobility skills then you should go QuasExort.Notable exceptions all AGI heroes  Ember Spirit  Flame Guard can be dispelled by Tornado and he doesnt get Remnant until level . Even if he gets it it costs  mana and he wont be able to sustain the escapes from EMP so go QuasWex. Medusa  She is completely mana dependent. Mystic Snake has an absurd mana cost and she relies on her mana to reduce damage. Go QuasWex drain her all the mana and watch her becoming a ranged creep. Venomancer  Doesnt have escape doesnt have passives that increase his damage and relies on mana. Destroying his mana make him a ranged creep. How to land EMP. EMP has a constant radius of  and a constant .s delay. So do the division of the radius assume you are perfectly casting EMP right on the target by the time the unit can actually move so outside of disables that prevent movement and youll find a value. This is the minimum required movement speed for the enemy hero fleeing EMP radius. So without anything to combo with EMP casting it alone .  . It means that a hero moving under  movement is unable to flee the EMP and will suffer the damage and mana loss while you recover some of the mana. Considering a hero has on average  initial movement speed and no hero has under  initial movement speed it is impossible to prevent a hero to flee EMP without any additional spell     so if an ally has a movement speed slow higher than  it is possible to successfully use EMP on a bootless hero     so if an ally has a slow higher than  it is possible to use EMP on a hero with boots. If you have stunrootother disables that completely prevent movement subtract the duration of it from . and divide  by the number you found. Lets use Tornado with  points of Quas as practical examples. It will disable for ... seconds so we have ..   ..   and ..  . So unless enemy hero has higher ms than  you can successfully use EMP. Level  Quas is enough for most bootless hero while level  Quas is enough for most heroes with boots alone. You can also combo it with Cold Snap but it is harder do pull on as there is projectile speed and attack animation to be accounted  with an ally even if he only attacks not using any skill at all it is possible to Cold SnapEMP successfully.  How much your combo costs in mana and how sustentable it is.Since EMP will regain you mana back based on Wex alone and all Invokers skill have fixed mana cost Cold SnapEMP will cost you  MP with Wex level  respectively while TornadoEMP will cost you  MP with Wex level  respectively. It is easy to say that unless you have some levels in Wex for getting more mana back and some levels in Quas for landing reliable Tornado you cant sustain the combos. So until Invoker reaches level  dont use the combos  use EMP if there is an allied gank for giving a strong slow or stun or use Tornado for dispelling things.  QuasExort is really forgiving in the lane because you have both high HP regen and high damage to last hit but it is harder to pull your combo in a teamfight because you cant reliably get Cold Snap procs by yourself target will probably escape the Sunstrike if there is not a long stun  also since you have no Wex or it is in low levels Tornado will have low rangeGhost Walk will slow you even more and EMP wont reduce your effective mana cost. While QuasWex is harder to lane with because you dont have the additional damage from exort from helping last hit or trading hits but it fairly easy to land the combo in teamfights and it is more sustentable if you need a escape route Ghost Walk will slow enemies more than it slows you so you can escape with it.,learndota2,dccfwra,3,t5_2tta4

You cant even benefit properly from an iron talon since the bonus damage you get is negligible. Extremely squishy this is covered by him losing to any support but it must be reiterated that your tether escape mostly cannot stop enemies from tower diving you. They would probably push the lane super hard since its a solo wisp and then when they have a creep wave they just throw  nukes and  last hits at you and youre dead.  Core wisp might not pay off that much more compared to a support wisp basically I feel that wisp offlane is way too high risk low reward. Even if you somehow win the laneObviously this is all theorycraft and it could work. I love laning creatively so if this ever works out Ill be happy.,learndota2,ddcah61,9,t5_2tta4

10648188,0,t1_dde995m,Thanks for the advice. I have a follow up question if I may.I play in a stack with my boyfriend. We have played a lot of games this weekend and we have come away dispirited with this patch because it seems like if we try the sorts of plays you are suggesting  that is anything other than joining the team fight  our team just disintegrates. Shrines are a problem too because they make it easier for the other team to react to split pushers.What seems to happen in this patch much more than before . is that both teams deathball and team fight then the winning team takes objectives  again supported by the ability to go heal up at a shrine then quickly get back to taking objectives. If we are not there to join in the team fight because were trying to split push wards or no our team goes v and just dies meaning that our team gets behind and our efforts to split push are in vain. Yesterday we played multiple games where someone on our team  us or someone else  split pushed and the rest of the team just died because we couldnt cope vs. the enemy team deathballed. I am not whining Im desperate. Do you have any advice? Please?PS it seems that the enemy players are never alone I think we had one game all weekend where one of the enemies was alone  they always deathball right after the laning phase. I dont know if Im  correct in this and I guess we could try warding more in the enemy jungle to check whether they are ever there farming. ,learndota2,ddea1c2,1,t5_2tta4

10674920,0,t1_ddh0w64,Yeah seems like it people dont really understand that when you play a game youre actually betting your MMR so every loss you convert to a win is actually net  MMR.Learning how to come back from your teammates feeding and losing all the lanes is how you know youre getting better. If a k player can come into k and literally win every single game he must be doing something right even if his team feeds. Learning how to adjust to the game as it plays out is extremely important instead of just Oh well we lost early game. On to next. With that mentality youre only going to win if you get a good start which happens like  of the games. Therefore you get stuck at your MMR.,learndota2,ddh1cto,1,t5_2tta4
10677153,0,t1_ddgtm8w,You will have quite a few matches where your skillsgiven that you are good at MOBAs which we all know isnt a given no matter how many matches youve played will exceed that of your opponents simply because the game is trying to fit you into your skill bracket. Just imagine how broken it would be if you were lucky and won your first ten games and then suddenly the match maker says well youre obviously in the very high skill bracket and slam dunks you into the borderline pro scene because you won your first ten matches. If youre stuck playing against people way below your skill level then use this time efficiently ok so you already know how to beat the fuckers try to use the time to learn something new like new heroes new play styles or something of the sort. IMO you should have played most heroes at least a couple of times so you know what to expect when you come up against a tinker AND you will also learn what to expect from the different heroes so you dont suddenly get a the fuck just happened? moment. Or at least fewer of them. Dont blame the dazzle supporting you in lane for not giving you kill potential on the enemy offlaner if you dont know what that hero actually does.

10679844,0,t3_5sruq9,Hello fellow Slark player!Ganking to snowball on Slark is still a thing but I find it to be less reliable.Slark is still a really great team fighter mid to late game getting to that point is just a bit different. Lane mechanics and item progression is key. You want to come online as soon as possible. I never get blink as the money could be spent on your core SBEcho Sabre early on.In a game where there are littleno soft targets just focus on getting SBEcho asap and then helping out in fights. Positioning in team fights is still where Slark shines. Weave in and out of the fights and be aware of cooldown on SB and Ultimate. Instead of engaging with a SB it may be best saved for a potential escape if you need it. Then you could always reengage with your stacks and then use ult as needed to stay alive or disengage.Heres a game that I played just the other day... I plan on having a full video review of it online shortly.  Itemization was key and you just have to ask yourself what you need to stay alive and overcome the enemy team. The longer you stay alive on Slark in a teamfight the better off you are.What MMR are you playing at if you dont mind sharing?

10699274,0,t1_ddjj03n,I mean I did stipulate the original definition of MMR hell in my original post. And secondly I can attest that there are people who have studied this game inside and out still have gotten no where due to a combination of personality andor inability to play. I dont know what world youre in but again  of my games in the past month have had at least  griefer in it k.k bracket. And when I use that example of nuking your waves I dont mean the support stealing a couple CS. I mean a support following you around and using Starstorm to kill your creepwave. I have had this personally and I think youre just lucky to not have those people or games. Maybe MMR hell for you doesnt exist because of who matchmaking pairs you up with. Maybe the understanding of how the system works needs to be redone. Who knows.I also think you underestimate how much effort people put into the game and while MMR hell is a convenient excuse it absolutely exists for these people. Its the same statement as Oh youre not gaining MMR? Its your fault for being lazystupid. Yes this is true to an extent because theyre not smart or skilled enough to outplay his own teammates. But that blanket idea is probably more ignorant than blaming Peruvians for your losses. I think at some point people have to accept that there is a limit to their play and that no amount of studying or replay analysis is going to help them improve.I recall reading a thread earlier about someone who went through  years of coaching and didnt gain that much MMR. Hes probably an example of that.To be honest reading your comments is slightly pissing me off because I think you have no idea how absurd matchmaking games can get because you havent played nearly enough games. Youre downplaying the rate of griefers for whatever wierd reason and maybe its just me. But at this point if you still havent understood the situation I dont believe there is a conversation left to continue because while I can understand you you cannot understand me.My challenge to you is to queue up USWUSE for  games and let me know. I see you are similar in MMR to me but you mostly queue EU where people tend to be more teamwork oriented.,learndota2,ddjjtx9,1,t5_2tta4

10707208,0,t3_5t5cnw,I think some of your problems start well before the second half of the game.  At  minutes you have  creep kills and a naked blink dagger.  Leading up to  minutes even though you said you added some duel wins you only have an extra blade mail.  You hit only  creeps between  minutes and  minutes.  You also didnt level you first skill a mistake but not a terrible one  but that means every time your duel is down you need to be hitting creeps.  Without your nuke and with duel on cooldown you dont do that much in fights.  You are a freefarming jungler  your goal is not just to be on par with invoker but to be exceeding him.  If you had farmed  as efficiently even with better items and more levels from  as you did from  you would have an extra k gold making all your item timings better possibly enabling all your later fights to go better.This wasnt the only time you stagnated on creep kills.  At  minutes you were by far the top farmer in the game but your creep score mostly just stagnates until the end of the game probably due to deaths.  This doesnt mean you should stop fighting or helping your team to go farm but every time you walk by a neutral camp with no urgent need to be somewhere kill it quickly.  Whenever you push a lane make sure you are killing all the enemy creeps.  The gold bounty is just as essential at  minutes as it is at .So point  about not falling off halfway through the game is keeping your farm high all game.Point  probably includes a lot of target selection.  You have a gold lead on everyone on the enemy team and especially sniper.  You did k damage total over the course of the entire game to sniper.  He is almost certainly priority number  for you to duel.  If you are having trouble with his shadow blade carry a dust.  Otherwise use your early farm advantage and initiation tools to win duels against him every time.  You dealt half your hero damage to Pudge and Bristleback.  That is fine if those  are the only ones left to kill but you need to let your team stun those  and ignore them to stop their sniper from just autoattacking in the back.  You were the one in the best position to make snipers game awful and it didnt happen even with your early gold lead.If you are having problems getting past the frontliners to the sniper use your shadowblade to reposition or smokes to wrap around without being seen.  A BKB also fixes a lot of your problems and I might have considered that before finishing the silver edge as good as that item is against the Bristleback.  As far as team comps go yours in theory scales just fine.  Your teamfight is also pretty good in theory with invoker and venomancer being able to put out a ton of aoe damage.  Actual execution Id have to watch the game but it certainly wasnt an outdraft or team on a timer.Itemwise a BKB would help vs  of Bounty and Dark Seer and a decent chunk against the Pudge.  Heart is nice but it wasnt an item that would change the game significantly.  I do prefer treads on LC over phase but that comes down to personal preference and I would never swap boots mid game unless Im upgrading them to Boots of Travel.  I would recommend finishing boots before blink though.  Should speed up jungle farming and with a support stunning to initiate you should be able to walk in and duel.  But I also like going a  skill build even in the jungle so I have the nuke and the bonus move speed it gives.   makes you strongest during duels but somewhat lackluster outside of them.,learndota2,ddkda4u,1,t5_2tta4

I have actually tried to play him with mana boots gt wand gt urn gt aether gt other and I just dont have enough mana.I obviously have to respect our skill difference so I have to ask should I change my playstyle to be more conservative about my mana pool?

When I try hard I really analyze when am I pushing it a bit too far or if I am doing it just right. Lost games arent the only games you should analyze. Every game is important.Most commonly even though I dislike Goodboys content I watch his channel for the sake of GameLeap videos. There were some educational videos I watched from BSJ and GameLeap that helped. Like Pushing and making use of space aggressive farming on heroes who can just to utilize as much farm on the map without harming your team and allowing other players to farm which helps in greedy pub lineups.I dont actually play unranked.

10974441,0,t1_debhuig,It depends a lot on the character and also the level of play. So often junglers in Dota in the current meta are roaming supports who would ideally split their time between the jungle and the mid and safelane forming a trilane in the safelane. While the one carry farms the support and the jungler either pull the creeps into the jungle to keep the lane near the friendly tower and get experience for themselves while denying it to the offlaner or zone the offlaner out by fighting him away from the creep wave. This is what currently happens in higher level dota. Mid and lower level games though dont run a trilane and instead often have a dual offlane or a dedicated jungler. In that case they would start in the jungle and stay there usually until they have one big item and level  then theyd go looking for ganks. Thats the theory of it anyway in a few specific cases Crystal Maiden should start immediately in the jungle. She should skill frostbite and use it to kill a large creep while stacking the camp then kill the other main large creep that spawns and maybe finish the camp again. Either way the two large creeps should be enough to get her level  about  into the match. She should then skill either arcane aura and head to the lane to support or skill crystal nova and start looking to fight early. Enigma should start by converting the ranged creep from his safelane into Eidolons and then head straight to the jungle. Bloodseeker Legion Commander and AntiMage should start in lane and then transition to farming jungle camps quickly during rotations. Nightstalker should start in lane during the day gank at night then move back to the jungle during day then gank again at night. During each day if a fights about to break out he should show up from nowhere and drop his ult turning it back to night and fight.Ultimately its situational and depends a lot on the hero youre playing the level of play and the needs of your team. Or at least it should.... Fucking jungle LC....,learndota2,debymw0,2,t5_2tta4

Luna am qop etc. In the lining phase I usually go talon into stout shield in to phase boots with a casual windlace. Please note that his thirst is PERCENTAGE movement speed. Get an echosaber which helps you get the person lower for higher thirst damage. Now I go euls here. Yes euls. This prevents people from TPing away once you rupture them you can also purge off silences or avoid some things with it. A cute trick is to use it and time your bloodrite at the right time so that It silences them and the really cant avoid itgot a few AMs this way if timed right . It also gives mana regeneration. Here I go for silveredge. Nice mobility so its great for ganks. Here you can go for a number of different things abyssal butterfly heart blood thorn Mjonnir. Butterfly being the main one of those. Aghs is also underrated. Tips . Go to the jungle from time to time with your Q on you your iron talon deals  of the creeps health. You can use this for quick xp and levels. . Try going for ganks on lanes which are having trouble once you hit level . Make sure to tell your team. Your Q makes the target deal  more damage but also take  more. Please be careful and note when its on you your effective hp Is  less. when Q is maxed. . If you put your Q on you and the target when you kill the target you get double the healing. . If the enemy has linkens use your Q to pop it. . Apply Q on your pusher during sieging or after a team fight. This makes them push a lot faster. This also works for nukers.

11128356,0,t3_5yviun,gt Ive heard that the meta isnt as concrete as Leagues meta but I mained ADC in league. Is there a similar to this? Ive played Sniper and he was fun.Yeah theres hard carries farm all game and then kick ass as well as magic carries get some levels kick ass. Hard carries are pretty much the strongest heroes in the late game while magic carries are good earlymid but fall off late. Spectre and Medusa are two popular hard carries Zeus Tinker Death Prophet and lots of others are magic carries. And of course theres plenty of heroes that fall in between like Luna or Drow.Sniper is pretty far up the hard carry ladder but he can have trouble farming and unlike a real hard carry hes always quite squishy.gt Do people not buy the recall scroll? I was looking at some guides and build orders and noticed that nobody was purchasing it. I use dotabuff so maybe they just dont show it. How would someone healgain mana?Recall scrolls arent shown in build guides because everyone assumes youll buy it. But theyre used to respond to ganks push etc NOT to hop back to the fountain. Dota is not like league where you can unload your spells. Mana management is crucial. With shrines you should never have to go back for mana occasionally for hp if youre almost dead but only rarely. Most games I never go back to fountain to heal unless Im already in the base.gt Some of my favorite Champion in league are Lucian Caitlyn Vi Nautilus Viktor and Zed. Are there heroes in Dota that are similar? Thematically Tidehunter is Nautilus and Viktor is Tinker. Tide plays pretty similar to Nautilus iirc. Tinker doesnt really play like Viktor he abuses boots of travel and his ult for unlimited teleports. Caitlyn is probably similar to Drow or Sniper I dont remember too much about that champion though. Cant offer any help with Vi or Zed.Unlike league you can play any of dotas heroes so dont feel like you have to find the perfect hero right away. You should play them all at least once anyways.gt What are some good learning resources? Any good general knowledge guides or videos that you know of?I usually use tortellinis builds as a base starting point. When I was new I followed them religiously but over time I started adapting them to my own particular playing. Other than that I just play and surf reddit. Sometimes Ill watch the occasional replay for my main hero but usually I just play.The current meta I just came back a few weeks ago from half a year away seems to be oriented more towards the early game and early game ganking. I would pick a midgame carry like Drow or Luna rather than going all out on a top hard carry like Medusa. But any hero can win even the ones with lt winrates.,learndota2,dete19v,0,t5_2tta4

That being said if you want to try something interesting as a semisupport bloodseeker start off in the jungle and rush brown boots and then force staff.

11416671,0,t1_dfprsb0,The other replies miss a major aspect of what makes a hero good at hitting buildings in competitive games. I assume youre talking about the recent DAC game where the ursa was hitting the tower in mid and the analysts said he had no business doing so I cant remember the game exactly but I think it was an NP game?The reason that ursa shouldnt have been hitting the game in THIS case was because of where he needs to be in the fight. It is completely dependent on the situation who should be hitting the tower on your team. The reason ursa shouldnt in this case is because his entire strength derives from being able to blow up one hero from fog. If hes hitting a tower the opposition know exactly where he is and can easily lock him downkite himdisable blink etc. Effectively removing his entire purpose from the fight. The reason juggnaix are ok at hitting towers is because they have a magic immune capability that lets them do it safely. If the opponents had a bane or mag or something it would be a lot more dangerous. Heroes like SF are good at hitting towers because they WANT to be in the middle of the fight.

Block his ancients when he reaches lvl . You dont really need to block them earlier since most people dont stack ancients anymore but it doesnt hurt for one of your supports or mids to check once. Taking offlane and mid T makes the offlane ancients unsafe for him. And the jungle ancients is a good spot to ward anyway for vision over their shrine and other movements. Go for a fighting build. Sven can farm better so dont save up forever for a Battlefury because youll lose hard in the midgame. Outplay him. Easier said than done but Sven is extremely onedimensional  all he can do is run at you and hit hard. You can spin or manta or blink to dodge stun. You can kite with diffusal. Make sure your team doesnt stack and teammates who can build force staffpike should. If you look at Svens matchup stats its almost funny how the list goes from melee on top to ranged at the bottom.

11573320,0,t3_655nsh,In my opinion It really depends on the situation. First you have to consider if you can execute the combo properly. Take into consideration if you have aghs or not. Executing tornadoempmeteorblast  without an aghs is very difficult. Compared to having aghs or possibly aghsoctarine which makes it easier. Second I think you should also decide if the heroes you are planning to use majority of your spells are worth it. Granted that you wont be using your combos on  heroes all the time sometimes its better to not use emp or meteor since they have a significant cooldown. I find that reserving those spells for important heroes like a medusa or tide who is positioned far away from the main group of heroes you are planning to combo can sometime be more effective. Also there are times that you dont want to use tornado ie. when a magnus has rped heroes I try to not use tornado since my right clickers would not be able to attack them in air thus wasting disable time. Overall You should asses the situations and make split second decisions. Dont worry since this would come over time when you rack up the games on invoker.

11658183,0,t1_dghdgbn,Farm priority is how we have come to understand roles or position in DotA.   is the hard carry the highest farm priority.   is the hard support the lowest farm priority.  But why?There is limited farm on the map.  If players are competent and efficient theres about enough farm for  people per team to farm.  Three!  Three people can farm all  lanes and the entire jungle.  Maybe theres some scraps left over for the position .  This means you need  players to play without needing much farm.At k and I would say up to mid k or so players just dont know how to farm at maximum efficiency.  That means that devoting players on your team to play without farm doesnt make sense.  Theres so much inefficiency that its often possible for  or even  people to farm.   if you sacrificee yourself so your team can farm theres just no guarantee that they capitalize on it.  When people are missing half the last hits in a free lane or jungling slowly or standing around doing nothing why are you sacrificing yourself for them?The whole farm priority concept doesnt make sense at k because people dont know how to farm.  So you might as well learn to farm with them.  You dont need to play a carry.  But you shouldnt be running around with brown boots at  minutes.  Farm up that mek or pipe or even a scythe or aghs.

11710152,0,t3_673ixm, How well you do in mid  min and late  min game depends much on a hero. Some carry heroes excel in mid game e.g. Sven QOP but are not that good late game while others are an unstoppable menace when they reach late game e.g. Sniper Spectre Medusa. An opposite to carry heroes are usually supports which can dominate early game e.g. Ogre Magi Undying Lion but fall off after mid game.Also never stop farming. Farm also after the laning phase and early game farm to maintain the advantage of experience and gold and afford items that will help you assert domination. Again depends on a hero and what you look for in the hero. For example Diffusal Blade is good for gankers slows down your opponent Dragon Lance for ranged heroes gives extra range Manta Style for pushing heroes creates illusions and escaping disables dispels debuffs. Butterfly is theoretically always good a lot of damage attack speed and armor from agility but expensive. Then you have items that give you other stats along with agility often making your hero tankier like Eye of Skadi Linkens Sphere and Aghanims Scepter but all of these are often bought because of their unique features.Think of the heroes you like to play and think what they need. Is it more sustainability or more damage? Maybe more movements speed or better escape? Look for builds on Dotabuff or ingame.,learndota2,dgndiwb,2,t5_2tta4
