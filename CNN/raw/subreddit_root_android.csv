I advise you to go to XDA forum find the S subforum and start reading the threads there are a lot of tutorials and useful information there along with almost endless amount of custom ROMs kernels and other useful stuff for your phone.,root_android,db3yw7p,1,t5_3bcy4

If you can gain root then you can install TWRP or if you can install TWRP then you can root but if you are unable to do either then your device likely wont have much modification available. Absolutely NEVER TRUST ANY WEBSITE BLATANTLY A TRAP LIKE THOSE! Its the same thing in the jailbreak scene with bullshit sites like cydiajailbreak.com or pangujailbreak.com or cydiaios.net or wtf ever they really are. Every last one of them complete and total bullshit with nothing but clickbait loops that will never lead to anything but more cents in the pocket of whatever faggot made them. If you are running an older kernel you may be in luck with the dirtycow exploit theres still a bunch of people actively finding more uses with it and have actually made it as easy as downloading and running a command through adb to get access to a limited but legitimately root shell. If you can get a root shell even if its just temp root then try to see if your device will let you read what your devices recovery partition is called poke around inside something like devblockplatformbynamerecovery it wont be this exact directory but if you can find it on your device and with a temp root shell you may be able to dd a custom recovery over it which would basically manually flash a recovery. Granted these are all highly advanced concepts and VERY easy to do irreversible damage but if you understand what Im talking about and are comfortable with your skills enough to try it out then something like this may just work. Ive flashed dozens of devices with dd and had no problems ya just gotta be careful. Or check out KingRoot not Kingoroot or whatever other bullshit those devs are beast at how many devices it supports and they actively maintain it to support more. Best of luck let me know if you have any questions ,root_android,dernecv,2,t5_3bcy4
