1181602,0,t3_27m46u,The biggest gripe I have with the Das Keyboard is its larger size and the shiny surface which looks really ugly as soon as you lay your fingerprints on it. My old transcription office ordered a number of Das Keyboards and I had my personal Filco Majestouch . None of them have broken after millions of keypresses and near constant heavy use. I sold my Filco to my friend and hes been using it for the last year and a half with no problems. We put countless millions of keystrokes on the keyboards so durability is no problem with either. My biggest gripe with the Filco is how easily the letters get rubbed off from heavy use. The vowels period and common keys were gone within a month and the finish is now gone on most keys. Definitely look into aftermarket keycaps if you care a lot about the aesthetics. ,keyboards,ci2jszp,1,t5_2rm65

1463987,0,t1_ciyq2ph,I would say thats your biggest thing right there  I believe Ive heard that the Razer keyboard youre using has Cherry MX Blues which are basically known for having a loud and clicky sound to them.I have MX Browns and not many people say anything about them  thats with them being on speakerphone on my desk...but Im not sure if thats more the keyboard or good noise cancellation on my phone. HahahaAnyway from what people have said MX Browns are quieter but MX Clears are supposed to be a small bit quieter than that.ORings usually only help noise when it comes to bottoming out the keys since when you bottom out with Orings its sooner and youre hitting the rubber not the key from how I understand it.Many people are saying in this...somewhat related thread that MX Browns with Orings might be your best bet for silence. ,keyboards,cizsbtb,1,t5_2rm65

A couple of people I know prefer mechanicals for typing but rubber domes for games.I personally use a Filco tenkeyless with blues and a Coolermaster Storm Quickfire Stealth pretty much a Filco Ninja tenkeyless with browns.You cant really go wrong with Filco Ducky Deck Code or Das. Many Coolermaster keyboards are pretty much Filcos as well.,keyboards,cma6l7g,2,t5_2rm65

2528024,0,t3_2om3as,Currently Im using a Razer Blackwidow  with blue switches and I really love it. Nice clicky sound and has a very good feel for gaming. Very easy to have accurate button presses. This is my first mechanical keyboard though.  Ive also heard really good things about the Corsair K and That one is probably more what you are looking for although a little above your price range. If i were to get another keyboard this would probably be the one I get Also most people will say that the type of switches depends on the types of games you will be playing. I think it was something like  RedBlues for FPS and RedBrown for Mobas ,keyboards,cmojs7j,0,t5_2rm65
2596266,0,t1_cmvcipl,Some people prefer Blues for gaming. Just because you didnt doesnt make that the same for everyone else. Its  personal preference and will vary heavily from person to person.

I do IT work and all the keyboards are standard ones so rubber dome but a decent version of the.The problem with bring your own is that keyboards have the possibility to have keyloggers inside of them or other malware as seen in some from China so for any position that deals with anything sensitive cannot be allowed to bring their own for security reasons. Since the company wants to lock down things as much as possible and never play favoritism it ends up saying no across the board and only allow differences if you have a medical condition.Naturally this doesnt happen at all companies and smaller ones can cater more to their employees.,keyboards,cp3cm35,1,t5_2rm65

4706791,0,t3_3feb1x,Do plan on ever changing the keycaps? The Steelseries is a nice board though it has very uncommon layout that extra large enter key making it near impossible to find any caps.Similar the Razors have a slightly different bottom row the Fn amp Win keys are  unit wide though this is less of a problem since several boards have that and many keycap sets have additional keys for that.Also very relevant would be the question which type of switch you want. The CM seems the only one that has several options of Cherry MX while the Steelseries seems not to offer any options and I cant find which they actually use mine has Cherry MX Black though I bought it long ago. The Razers use Razers own switches no idea what quality those are.Also since those are all mechanicals you may want to ask over at rMechanicalKeyboards and look at the sidebar and wiki there which should have lots of infoPersonally I would go with the CM. I have a CM Quickfire TK and it works very reliable for quite some time. Well actually I would go with a totally different board but you said thats not an option,keyboards,ctntugx,1,t5_2rm65

Blank keycap exist which remove all the letters and people still type on them. you might consider looking at  for some keycap sets.
