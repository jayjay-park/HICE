2863744,0,t3_2st9hi,Had to wait to watch this episode until tonight and had almost recovered from seeing the laughing salesman by the time the outro banter came.  Then the credits of course had to freeze frame his face right at the end. So much for sleeping tonight or ever again.    Thanks Game Sack for providing new visuals for my nightmares!    As always thanks for another great episode! ,GameSack,cntlxgi,3,t5_2z0nv

5102043,0,t1_cv01mh9,Nintendo has a history of playing the market establishing a strangle hold and thus a firm monopoly.Even after nintendo got sued for it and forced to reimburse SNESNES purchasers for millions they somehow convinced the judge to tack on a lot of arbitrary requirements so that even a lot of legitimate console owners would never be able to claim their piece of the settlement.  I believe the settlement was around  million and they ended up only paying some number of k or more. But for all the good things nintendo has brought to gaming the road to success wasnt paved in happy yellow bricks and gum drops. ,GameSack,cv0ziby,3,t5_2z0nv
