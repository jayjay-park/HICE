5023575,0,t3_3jqwop,I see Reuters has explained that Unhappy Democrats Need to Wait to Get Into Canada. In a post below Kate posts Before people get too carried away with the blue state vs red state debate... Unfortunately I just love to get carried away.It occurred to me that all these American celebrities and liberals while waiting to head to Canada to live out the Bush White House years in exile might find our politics a little bit confusing especially since we colourcode our political maps the exact opposite to them. In the US the conservatives are shown as red and the liberals in blue whereas in Canada the conservatives are blue and the liberals red.ExilemapSo what Ive done as any good host would is to switch the Canadian colours around so these exiles will know where they should go. First of all youll notice that you should probably best stay out of Western Canada lots of red there. Ontario just to the right of the red blob is your best bet though you certainly can check out the eastern seaboard which is much like your northeastern seaboard. New Yorkers in particular should feel right at home in say Labrador. Thats what I would recommend.Youll also notice a lot of liberal blue in the far north. This region is distinct for being very sparsely populated there is lots of room and all that room is liberal. You will be very free there especially from Big Tobacco well lots of northerners smoke but theres plenty of outdoors as I said. To be honest I dont really know how the Inuit poll on issues like abortion and gay marriage and the war in Iraq but you might give it a go. In this column by Greg Weston in the Ottawa Sun he talks of turning Canada into the Las Vegas of gay weddings though its hard to say whether our northern citizens would warm up to this. I fear they may call it another act of cultural genocide. But the Supreme Court will certainly straighten them out oops unintentional reverse pun on that. Yellowknife would be a great honeymoon spot. Activities include snowmobiling and caribou hunting.That light blue area thats Quebec. Perhaps it should be colourcoded dark dark blue but then maybe not. Not to worry. Somebody will probably explain that to youagain and again and again and againwhen you get here. WelcomeBienvenue!,Northlands,curj5zw,1,t5_38k4y
