71884,0,t3_1uwxne,EC this match just doesnt have enough offensive capability to kill Eradonsince he is the main offensive force of HampS. Eradon with fire chakra based armor is nigh invulnerable to wind based attacksthe element cycle and stuff. Fire chakra probably doesnt hurt someone who is pumping fire chakra in their veins so that attack is out too. Crashing Water Rapids is a ranged technique susceptible to defensive sealing so that would get reversed. Storm Armor is basically the same thing as Dragons Scales just with a different chakra so those two cancel out in case of them attacking each other. After TBs EC doesnt have the speed to attack Eradon either. At  SPDSTMSTR Eradon out classes all of EC alone. Teham Heat and Seals wins.,NarutoBattleGrounds,cemm2pk,1,t5_2wjmc

184666,0,t3_1w7um7,Team  Ashes of Time not a voting commentName Suzuna JibunkiriNinja Info Suzuna Jibunkiri is the greatest and technically only member of the eccentric Jibunkiri time cutter clan of Uzushiogakure. At the age of  Suzuna used her clans secret techniques to accidentally erase her clans existence from the timeline. Chakra Type See Kekkei GenkaiKekkei Genkai Time Manipulation  Suzunas ninjutsu and attacks use the element of time to create wild and fantastic effects. Instead of manipulating elements for combat Suzuna manipulates time to various ends such as throwing enemies forward in time or shaking time back and forth violently to cause internal damage to her enemies. To enemies affected by the technique it appears as though Suzuna has sped up. To allies affected by the technique it appears as though their environment has slowed down.Passive Effect Time Leeching  Suzuna leeches time actively and passively creating a pair of effects to boost her combat performance Time Leeching passive  Suzuna drains time particles from the environment around her whenever she strikes a target or uses a ninjutsu that affects the target. Whenever she has drained time particles she actives the second portion of her passive. This effect persists for  minute after the drain and cannot stack more than once per opponent this effect will refresh itself on an opponent if it would be applied while already active. Time Leeching active  Whenever Suzuna has drained time particles from an opponent Suzuna reduces her opponents speed by  and gains speed equal to the amount drained gaining up to  speed per opponent. Additionally Suzuna gains constant future sight to see up to  second into the future and  seconds into the past. Equipment Suzuna carries a chakra blade that she can channel her abilities through. Should this blade be destroyed Suzuna can simply reach through time and grab another sword with identical qualities  but no more than  sword can exist at a time.Jutsu     Temporal Curtain  With a swing of her sword or a wave of her hands Suzuna sends a time displacement wave in front of her in a fast traveling wide arc. People Objects and ninjutsu touched by Temporal Curtain immediately cease to exist. After  seconds the objects and ninjutsu are restored to the map and will continue as though nothing had happened to them. People gain a  second immunity from this technique after being affected by Temporal Curtain so that Suzuna cannot keep a target suspended indefinitely. This ninjutsu applies Suzunas passive.Temporal Dissonance  Suzuna fires concentrated bolts of time particles that explodes upon contact with the first physical object they touch. These bolts of time tear muscles and create internal bleeding as the enemys body is violently jarred backwards and forwards in time. This ninjutsu applied Suzunas passive.Blink  Suzuna jumps through time and space with a temporal body flicker instantly traveling to a nearby location with the option to stall her return by up to  seconds. During this time Suzuna ceases to exist similar to the way that Temporal Curtain works. At the beginning and end points of Suzunas Blink Suzuna creates a temporal wave that applies her Time Leeching Passive passive but have no other effect. Team Buff temporary  minute bonus Temporal Cleansing  Suzuna passes a wave of time over Nu that returns his body to optimal form removing any stat debuffs not damage while also granting him a  minute immunity from any further stat debuffs and control effects. Constant exposure to time particles has sped up Nu granting him  speed. Stats Strength Ninjutsu Speed Intelligence Stamina ANDName NuNinja Info Nu is the legendary user of Ash Release which provides him with the highly useful Ash Replacement ability. He is bulky and can take many hits he also has massive chakra reserve to fire his powerful jutsu with.Chakra Type Fire amp WindKekkei Genkai Ash ReleasePassive Effect Ash Replacement  When hit by any physical attack eg. Rasengan Taijutsu Projectiles the area of impact is replaced by Ash causing it to pass straight through the user. If the enemy uses a long range elemental jutsu Lightning bolt earth bullet the ability loses half of its effectiveness and so Nu still takes half of the damage dealt. If any kind of Water release is involved in the attack this ability is void and the landed water attack does double damage. However the Ash provides complete immunity to all Wind and Fire jutsu.Equipment Light Armour. Forehead protector.  Pairs of Goggles that can see through ash one for teammateJutsu     Ash Release Giant Ash cloud The user covers the battlefield in a thick ash cloud only those with visual prowess or special eye gear can see through the black ash. Whats more is that the Ashs temperature can be increased to slowly burn areas of the users choice providing it knows where the enemy is. Think of an enhanced Hidden Mist technique that also burns foes that stand around in one place for too long.Fire Release Sphere of Evaporation The user casts a strange heated sphere around himself to use as a defence against water attacks as any water that comes into contact with it to instantly evaporates. while inside the sphere the users body also heats up causing attacks that touch this users skin to burn on contact.Summoning Jutsu Namo Namo is a Mighty Ash Bird who possesses the ability to see straight through Ash. She is rideable and can spit volcanic magma from the skies with deadly accuracy. STR  NIN  SPD  INT STMVolcanic Drop The area beneath the targets feet becomes a strong quicksand made of hot ash. It will suck the enemy into the ground where they will fall into a volcanic underground pit of magma. If caught only those with above average speed and strength can escape victims must have more than  strength and  speed to escape.Team Buff temporary  minute bonus Sacred Ash Suit  Nu creates a special ash that attaches to Suzuna like a suit of body armour. The ash suit grants the wearer immunity to Wind and Fire ranged jutsu for  minutes after being equipped.Suzuna receives  Strength and  Stamina.Team Ultimate Great Temporal Ash Cloud  Suzuna and Nu combine their power to summon a super massive cloud of time infused ashes. Enemies inside the cloud suffer from dramatically reduced vision significantly increased temperatures and constant but random time slips. Enemies affected by the time slips are constantly phased in and out of time causing movement loops with a similar effect to Dj vu where they are returned to a location that they were just at. Touching the ashes causes painful burns. The combined heat and time particles create a convection effect that causes the victims to suffer from dehydration which causes hallucinogenic effects if they stay in the heat for too long.Stats Strength Ninjutsu Speed Intelligence Stamina Team Strategy Nu and Suzuna operate as an efficient tag team by following an attrition war followed by a quick one two punch to eliminate their opponents quickly. At the start of each match Nu will summon his fire bird Namo and Suzuna will act as a body guard while Nu pumps his ash cloud over the field. Namo will fly above the battle field at a safe distance and bombard their opponents with magma. From there they will use their team ultimate to cripple and damage their opponents from afar. Using Suzunas time machinations Nu is able to keep their opponents under the constant heat effects of the Great Temporal Ash Cloud until their ability to fight back is greatly diminished. To quickly kill their enemies Suzuna will blink next to her opponents and send them forwards in time with a Temporal Curtain. Then Nu and his summon will bathe the area in magma and ash so that when their opponents return to the battlefield they will be engulfed in hot and gooey death before the opponents can react. Against faster opponents Suzuna relies on her Blink and Temporal Curtain to keep melee fighters and dangerous ninjutsu under control while Nu uses his Ash Replacement Technique to protect and reposition himself in order to create a quick kill. Additionally Nu uses his Sphere of Evaporation to remove the threat of water against them. Against long range opponents Suzuna and Nu will outlast them by locking them in their Great Temporal Ash Cloud while Namo and Suzuna pelt their enemies with magma and time bullets. Suzuna will use Temporal Curtain to temporarily cancel large attacks in order to give both players time to evade the attack. Nu will use his Sphere of Evaporation to remove any large water attacks before they connect.,NarutoBattleGrounds,cezgygd,1,t5_2wjmc
232491,0,t3_1wqzpd,Im back and better than ever! Sorry Ive been quiet the last couple matches work got a little hectic. Copy and Paste very heavily relies on Shiryokus genjutsu it all comes down to whether or not they can effectively place it. The answer is a very very definite no. Im going to assume that you need to be decently close to use a visual genjutsubecause you cant really have eye contact with someone  feet away. So Shiryoku needs to get close to either Kaze or Shanshouo to use genjutsu. Kaze is flying around like he just dont care so hes not a valid target so he has to go for Mr. black iron salamander. Unfortunately for him the only thing that counters the iron is speed which he has none of. He cannot avoid the iron techniques and Shanshouo has higher ninjutsu so he has faster casting time. Without genjutsu Copy and Paste cannot win. ,NarutoBattleGrounds,cf4uhbs,1,t5_2wjmc
465081,0,t1_cfssg8c,The largest advantage BoD has is once again the Hiding in the Mist technique. Anything in the Mist would be instantly weakened although the Mist would not kill anything instantly the Scarab would be down to  stamina which would make it easy pickings for any of BoDs long range attacks removing the fear of the genjutsu. The Snake would fall pretty quickly after that with only  stamina and since it would be the only thing on BCs team that could track in the mist they would be fighting blind the rest of the match. That would make picking everyone else off in the mist a pretty easy feat especially since with team buffs all of BoDs attacks are imbued with Decay chakra.,NarutoBattleGrounds,cft4qef,1,t5_2wjmc

1133152,0,t3_26zs1h,I dont know if Im the only one who had trouble deciding here. Both teams are strong and It took me a long time to be certain which one will have the advantage in this match. Im not seeing much discussion here apart from the guys on the teams who are awesome by the way but Ill leave my reasoning here anyhow.I was trying to think out what terrain each team would choose. Theres more stone in the mountains for Marginal so that might be better for them. I also think that a rocky seaside would be good for Marginal. Team Spanish Inquisition will probably prefer the open plains which will allow Sumaru to make use of his speed and Akira to use her arrows unrestricted. The mountains might work for Akira giving her the ability to go from peak to peak for sniping. Of course shes intelligent and she knows the other team can become higher than her on mountainous terrain so she wouldnt even try that. Swamps and rivers will probably favour the other team by making their water jutsu easier.On more consideration I think that Akira and Sumaru will be choosing the battleground. Sumarus team buff will ensure that.  I think theyre going to end up fighting in a forest clearing to be honest. A big one preferably one not close to a river. Even with Akira having tall trees shell not be able to do much sniping.I wonder if Akira can use Hiraishin level ? Shoot an arrow straight up teleport there snipe at her target and move back to a safe spot? I think that she can play that game well since she has so many arrows. With Ketakos high intelligence this is going to work once at most.Ketakos high intelligence poses a natural counter to Akiras. I think that even disadvantaged Ketako is going to quickly realise the problem with their team strategy and end up erecting a pillar and spike earth defence to give them a better chance. This would involve raising pillars parallel to the ground from the side of the first one and then raising more spikes or pillars at the edges of those to form a defence. It might also make sense to use spikes as a minefield to make climbing the first pillar harder. I dont see Ketako and Watashi wasting too much chakra on preparations though. Their ninjutsu needs too much chakra. Still they are going to have to delay preparing their strategy until and unless they have prepared some defence against Akiras arrows and Sumarus attempts to climb the cliff. Once that is done I think that Mizu Machinegun can be used to attempt to hold the fort for two minutes. However lightning arrows are a natural counter to earth jutsu. Theyre also a problem for the water snake jutsu. That means that Team Marginal have no choice but to prepare for three minutes and try to launch the team ultimate. Even with Mizu Machinegun its going to be a tough call. I dont see Watashi sacrificing both hands to that jutsu. If he does he cant use Leaf Blower. Using leaf blower is absolutely essential to repelling Sumaru and also to try to defend against arrows as necessary. Theres no way they are dodging the arrows or Sumaru with the speed stats they have. The arrows are faster than Leaf Blowers winds! Im pretty sure with Sumaru acting as a distraction if nothing else theres going to be trouble if Watashi tries to defend by himself.So we arent going to be seeing the team ultimate or water serpent this fight. First off theres no chance theyll be launched before Watashi goes down. Second if the team somehow succeeds a bunch of arrows are going to end up killing the SerpentMud dragon.With their best advantages taken away due to an incredibly large preparation time I think that team Marginal will lose.,NarutoBattleGrounds,chx37wr,1,t5_2wjmc

4478422,0,t3_3cfapa,Yo guys! Im gonna discuss here why dreamer wins this fight! Good Luck pdavidx!!I WOULD APPREICIATE IF YOU SEE MY POINT BEFORE VOTING!StatsgtStrength  to  In close combat dreamer will crush his enemy who boasts a minimum strength stat HE CAN NOT DEAL WITH DREAMERS TAIJUTSU WITHOUT HIS AWAKENING!gtSpeed  to This on top of dreamers blink uppercut ability make him be able to easily reach his opponent who has less than half speed after noticing him which is easy due to SharingangtInt   to This is probably the only part that would cause dreamer problems however dreamer can with some effort break free using his Sharingan which we all know is adapt at dealing with Genjutsu.gtNin  to Irrelevant for dreamer as his Justu are all powered by his  strength stat he has a ranged abilty which can also disrupt arrows mid flight or target the defensless Eoi directly.gtEnd   to Dreamer can last MUCH longer than Eoi who has limited arrows anyway. After that he has to use chakra to make them and this is gonna be expensive. Also he cant take many hits  combo would do it. If Eoi gets caught he has lost.And here is why Eoi will get caught.Sharingan is a great tool for perception and this is key to locating Eoi. I doubt that Eoi will be able to outsmart the Sharingans perceptiveness.What then?Well then Eoi is forced to awaken which gives him  minutes breathing time although Eoi will still be susceptible to Force Palm barrages. After these  minutes are up which they will be because there is no chance dreamer is going to be hit by arrows which he can dodge with his crazy speed or disrupt mid air with his Force Palm then dreamer can blink onto his location with ease and execute his combo which awakened or not will take out the  endurance Eoi.Thanks for reading guys. Kept this short to be rid of fluff. ,NarutoBattleGrounds,csv69ns,1,t5_2wjmc
