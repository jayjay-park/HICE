7103471,0,t3_4cp2s1,I had the same issue and contacted the TeamviewerTeam.They told me it would be someone which I had a contact with before which I defintely hadnt. And I should add him not kidding and ask him where I know him from if I dont know him I should delete him after.I told them it is a kinda risky advice on which they only replied with a thanks for your feedback.The conversation was in German if someone wants the conversation on imgur anyway let me know.,teamviewer,d1ljuqo,2,t5_2sklc

7814032,0,t1_d3u9os6,While avicap.dll is indeed a legitimate Windows DLL this particular sample is not.  The TeamViewer executable named cfmon.exe in this case tries to load the legit version but due to how Windows finds DLLs that they need the malicious DLL gets loaded instead.  This is because it is in the same directory as the TeamViewer executable.  Read this FireEye article describing how search order hijacking works. Dont assume something is safe just because it has a safe filename.  ,teamviewer,d3ud0rf,2,t5_2sklc
7814744,0,t3_4mc6q1,You probably used the same account  thats how I help my Mom. Its most likely that deleting the account actually works and account based connections no longer work to your grandfather. However unless you disabled it the IDrandom password would still be working. That does not seem to be the source of the attacks but its a slim possibility.,teamviewer,d3ufwg1,2,t5_2sklc
7815446,0,t1_d3ufp6g,Theyre blaming other services because its inconceivable that theyre the ones at fault apparently.  In reality it probably is their fault in some way but you must have reused your password elsewhere is an easy answer that is true unfortunately often.  ,teamviewer,d3uiqsr,9,t5_2sklc

7859045,0,t3_4mwa7h,There is no vulnerability that so far has been discovered.  TeamViewer by default is setup with weak security.   You got hacked probably because you reused the same password on a site that got hacked recently andor you use a weak and easy to crack password to begin with.Follow the instructions here to better secure your account.  www.howtogeek.comhowtolockdownteamviewerformoresecureremoteaccess,teamviewer,d3zfef3,3,t5_2sklc

10774726,0,t3_5qh8fv,Hey! I had the same problem and after a lot of messing around I got it to work by installing it as a System App. You will need root. Im not sure if you can just install it as a System App with something like Lucky Patcher but what I did was. After TeamViewer downloads the QS Addon APK retrieve it from Internal StorageAndroiddatacom.teamviewer.host.marketfilesDownloadTeamViewerQSAddon.apk. Use a file explorer that has root permissions and the ability to change files and folders permissions I use ES. Create a folder in systemapp or systemprivapp named TeamViewerQSAddon with rwx rx rx. Put the APK in that folder and change its permissions to rw r r. Reboot and it should work! Tested on my OPPO Find running CM.,teamviewer,ddrc2w0,1,t5_2sklc
