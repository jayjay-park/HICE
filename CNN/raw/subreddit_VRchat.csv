10648658,0,t3_5sdu3x,I messed around with Mixamo quite a bit last night and it took me a while to get things working.  Mixamo seems to be quite fussy.  Often I had to make multiple attempts to upload my .fbx into Mixamo.  Somtimes it got stuck loading my model...other times it showed up blank your issue.  Nine times out of ten if I was able to get my model loaded the rigging was not accurate and I had to rework the skeleton points.  It was quite frustrating.  Eventually I got it working though.  I am at work now and wont be able to check out your .fbx until tonight but here are some things I noticed  . Check how many polys your model has.  I found that Mixamo gave me a lot of trouble when I had high poly counts.  I had to use Blenders decimate feature to lower the polys resulting in a crappy looking model.  .  Did you use Blender to actually model your avatar?  If so did you export it as a Unity .fbx instead of just a .fbx?  I will check out your file tonight and get back to you.  ,VRchat,ddebs4k,2,t5_32s02
