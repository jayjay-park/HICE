4704869,0,t1_ct6qsgx,Capitalism requires price discovery in order to work.What price discovery do you have when the federal government writes a blank check regardless of credit or ability to pay? Why are there special rules for bankruptcy for this sector and only this sector?True capitalism actually does not work that is why every nation in the world has regulations. The problem is the modern US system is a meld of crony capitalist socialism. Taking the worst of everything. ,lawschoolscam,ctnl4ga,1,t5_2siln
