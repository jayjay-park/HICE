1356696,0,t3_29me8x,I play a way faster kind of blues usually so take this with a big grain of salt  What you did was nice but try to stick with one tonepod setting when doing stuff like this I think it sounds much better when your guitar sounds the same throughout the whole song the wah? pedal was nicely done though.  Im sorry if my english is kinda sucky English isnt my main language,bluesguitarist,cimcp0l,1,t5_2wq02

2928316,0,t3_2tmpvo,I definitely agree with almost everything here but if someone said Start from the V I would assume that means starting from bar  of a  bar blues instead of the turnaround which is usually just the last two bars. Good luck man!,bluesguitarist,co0yknk,2,t5_2wq02
2928486,0,t1_co0yuse,When you said start at the turnaround thats actually what I assumed SoVX IV x I x VXI suppose that means my understanding of the definition of turnaround is a bit off. How would you explain it if you dont mind.,bluesguitarist,co0z9q6,1,t5_2wq02

4850857,0,t1_cu5yy5s,Yep. Bluesnoodler posted a Gary Davis song last year that I really wanted to learn so I looked for a tab but couldnt find one. I made a post asking for a tab and no one else could find one either and in the end  I had to work it out.I had just bought a new guitar and decided to make a real effort to get really good at it after playing half arsed for bout  years. Theres not a lot of tabs out there for the music I want to play and I learn better having a tab in front of me. Id just finished a CS degree and was looking to build a portfolio so all the stars aligned and it made sense to start a project like this. Im actually pretty surprised that Ive managed to keep up with it every week so far and my playing has improved tremendously. When I play nowdays I just pick up the axe strum a chord and just improvise using some of the tricks Ive learnt from all the guys whose songs Ive worked out. Plus my ear is ridiculous at the moment. If you have any requests just shoot me a message and Ill see what I can do.,bluesguitarist,cu5ziw4,5,t5_2wq02

10795739,0,t3_5udrx8,Personally if someone asked me to recommend blues music theres no way Id list any modern artists. Usually people seek out the blues because theyre seeking something much more raw and emotionally rich than newer music. Zztop and allman brothers are mostly rock or blues rock. Even their songs youd consider blues are just remakes or riffs straight from older blues artists. Less worthy ones at that. Just my opinion. I genuinely believe that if Billy Gibbons or Gregg Allman were here theyd refuse to let someone like Charlie Patton Willie Mctell Willie Johnson or Son House take a backseat to their music. And theres a ton more. No disrespect but I know John Mayer and Joe Bonamassa are talented. But playing blues songs dont make you a bluesman. I wouldnt trade one Fred McDowell song for their whole catalog personally.,bluesguitarist,ddti515,1,t5_2wq02
