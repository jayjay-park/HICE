20103,0,t3_1tgob1,First off good luck on graduating and second its hard to start off finding jobs. I graduated  years ago and still nothing. I have a fair size list of sites bookmarked but Ill only list a few I like the best. I have a mix of UK and US sites if youre interested in going abroad.  This one has a list of sites.  Used to be good but havent checked in a while. Unsure if this is for you but the British Antarctic Survey post on their twitter and website about jobs. Hope any of these help. ,marinebiology,cegpzro,1,t5_2rsnr

However it is illegal to collect though without a permit.Here in California there are groups you can call for Marine Mammal strandings and they may be able to identify the species and possibly which specific animal that bone came from in their records.,marinebiology,cgn7ksn,1,t5_2rsnr

It will be even more difficult the following years due to budget cuts. Of the  current biology graduate students with TAships only  are getting contract renewals for Spring . This means the bio department will be offering either fewer labs or bigger classes. Its a shame UH was a great place to study. ,marinebiology,cm4or9p,1,t5_2rsnr

4920461,0,t1_cue8psu,It depends on which University. I attended Deakins Warrnambool Campus. Other Universities may have different outlines and larger class sizes which can mean more competition.  I found that my peers in my course were much more cooperative than competitive. The units themselves are fairly even in difficulty  I find that it depends upon your individual strengths and what prior knowledge you have. Likewise the coursework can be very fun depending on your interests. I had a whole unit on statistics and another on Environmental Planning but I had fantastic units on aquatic pollution.,marinebiology,cuerguc,1,t5_2rsnr

7230706,0,t3_4eguek,well hopefully you are talking about algae in the water column but you could get crazy and figure out whats growing on the glass too. So for the water column its pretty simple. Make sure you have a homogeneous mixture mix the water around. You will then use a hemocytometer to count the number of algae. Look up how to use a hemocytometer but basically its a grid with a defund amount of liquid. You count the cells in a certain number of grids and extrapolate to get cellsml. Then all you do is multiple this by the total liquid you have.To sample algae on the sides will be much more difficult and probably not as accurate. You will need to scrape off a defined area and count the number of cells then extrapolate. But algae growing on the sides will likely not be evenly distributed. You will need to take many samples. You eventually end up with a cellscm then you just multiple this number to the total area of the culture vessel ,marinebiology,d202t7w,6,t5_2rsnr

8085078,0,t1_d4ottzp,The term nursery habitat can describe both. Estuarine habitats for instance act as nursery habitats in both local settlement and allowing pelagic larvae andor juveniles to grow out before returning to open water. Though I see what youre saying with regard to reproductive adults. Perhaps my explanation was an oversimplification! What were really looking for is high larval connectivity The four things that an MPA truly looks to achieve areAdequacyensuring that the sites have the size shape and distribution to ensure the success of selected speciesRepresentabilityprotection for all of the local environments biological processesResiliencethe resistance of the system to natural disaster such as a tsunami or floodConnectivitymaintaining population links across nearby MPAsCorals just happen to fit the bill very well. ,marinebiology,d4ou4q5,1,t5_2rsnr

8455636,0,t3_4v3elj,Absolutely fantastic that youre going to teach her coding. A lot of biology majors shy away from it and itll give her a leg up. My other recommendation is getting her familiar with statistics. Doing good stats is so important in research and if she so decides stats is a hugely important field right now that is hiring aplenty.  Introduce her to a microscope and plankton. Its much harder to find work for big macrofauna like whales and sharks that people love. If she can appreciate the cool world that is the microbiology of the ocean I think shes gonna be well set for future academics where shell have to write papers on algae and stuff.  And you havent mentioned them yet but swimming surfing SCUBA and snorkeling are all activities that attract like minded people. Getting her involved will keep her physically fit give her an interesting hobby and may connect her with some people in the area who can help her out even more.  I no longer live in California but I know some folks in SoCal who may be able to help too. I have some friends at Scripps and UCLA doing marine bio research.,marinebiology,d5yhmso,3,t5_2rsnr

9638078,0,t1_da12rlp,I think it was either a paper itself or an article about the paper and related research I dont remember. I will have to try and dig it up and this is a really bad habit that I have built were I am very good at just integrating knowledge with my previous knowledge that I forget where who and when I learned something because as we all know memory is not perfect.See and that is the problem I have an interest in literally everything. I like cognition and reproduction as it seems to be areas that are either have not been explored much or create more questions each time something new is learned. Like...the paper that I believe recently was published on the size of the vestigial pelvis bones in male cetaceans still plays a large role in reproductive physiology by how it anchors and that larger generally means more reproductive success but that is an aside because I could be happy studying something as foreign to Marine Sciences as Astronomy. And even then I considered a back up plan to be herpetology though being I am not as well read in that area I dont really know what to begin.My professor started with doing lab studies with the effects of ozone on plant growth for her Masters but she recently submitted a paper on cushion plants. I dont know why she changed over after her Masters but that is kind of why I am not sure what is considered enough information to start with or even with the year being as late as it is if would be better to just wait it out another year and just have stuff prepared if I should try and reach out still. I dont want to burden my professors for Letters of Recommendations and stuff either.I have to admit I have never really handled uncertainty well and that I am torn between focusing in on a graduate degree or putting more effort into Art which I have done as a hobby and progressed a lot in since I first started really taking an interest in that so I am almost caught between passions and absolute joys because I love learning but the art is relaxing and enjoyable because I get to see a result of years of learning and hard work pay off where a degree is much farther out. So it is like if I focus on art it could come to pay my way for graduate school in terms of the extra costs or that getting a degree and higher paying jobs would allow me to pursue art or I could even try both simultaneously but I would have be extremely dedicated.Now I hope you forgive me for basically just thought streaming here it is just a lot has been weighing on my mind with where to go in my near future and which route I should take. I cant expect you to have answer but it is interesting that there are moments where...I just open up more than normal hooray psychology.,marinebiology,da13b9u,1,t5_2rsnr
