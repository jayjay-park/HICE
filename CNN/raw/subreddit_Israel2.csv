984353,0,t1_chg671i,I prefer rIsraels content for the most part I just read about this sub as a part of the seemingly interminable drama that some users seem to be perpetuating over there and thought if have a look. Ill check back and If I see something that makes me think Ill post a comment or question. My original post was just an idle wonder. Risrael has no shortage of opinions but this place seems not to have a burbling conversation at its core I was musing about why. ,Israel2,chg6g32,3,t5_30k5l

2120212,0,t3_2j8gcl,From Netanyahus Statement The root cause of this summers outburst of violence was Hamas rocketing of Israeli cities and these rocket attacks often exploited UN neutrality using UN facilities and UN schools as part of the Hamas machine of terror. And when rockets were discovered inside UN schools some UN officials handed them back to Hamas  that very same Hamas that was rocketing that very same time Israeli cities and Israeli civilians. ... What is the root cause of Hamas rocket fire on Israel? Its Hamas opposition to Israels very existence. Hamas doesnt give a hoot for the  lines. For them Israel has no right to live in any borders. Hamas rejects our very existence. Theyre committed to killing every Israeli and every Jew. You just have to read their charter  they say that very plainly. ... I believe that unilateral steps by the Palestinians at the United Nations will not advance peace. I think theyll do the very opposite. Theyll bring about a further deterioration in the situation  something none of us want. ... I want to add a word about the violence on the Temple Mount because its very clear what is causing it. It is not that Israel is in any way changing the status quo. Were not. Im committed and Israel is committed to maintaining the status quo exactly as its been for many decades.What were seeing are Palestinian extremists who are instigating violence through incitement. The incitement is spread by false and baseless rumors that we are threatening the Muslim holy places. ... Israel scrupulously maintains the protection of the holy sites the right of all religions to worship in their holy places and will continue to do so maintaining order maintaining freedom of worship. ,Israel2,cl9bpof,1,t5_30k5l

5562003,0,t1_cwmhhlm, Most other ethnicies did not survive their displacement  with notable exception of Sinti or had their own countries all along.gtThe idea of a country that operates like a night club where only one ethnicity is on the guest list seems to be the crux of what makes me unsure about all of this.Sorry but thats an  example of False equivalence Nightclub is all about entertaiment business and not representation of an ethnicity. By default nightclub operators are allowed f.e. to select people based on their perceived financial status or discriminate based on gender they are not obliged to provide free entry to everyone.   However  nation state if more like family reunion or wedding reception where  close associates only and  relatives are invited.,Israel2,cwmimjx,2,t5_30k5l
