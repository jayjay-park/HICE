20610,0,t1_ce98vhf,The CRpanama border on the Caribbean side is a bit of a pain in the ass. Its a spread out border and you have to cross this old rail road bridge with huge holes in. Fun. Then on the panama side they try and drag you in to this unofficial room and sting you for  or  dollars for a fake sticker in your passport just straight up tell them no. The CRNicaragua border at peas Blancas is also a great laugh!   iv crossed this border  times now but I think I have the hang of it. Again this border is stretched out over a kilometre so there is a bit of walking with your bags searches by the police random people checking your passport people shouting cambio cambio cambio and taxi taxi taxi in your face but with you speaking Spanish it makes it easier. But saying all this if you want to pay  more to get a nice big comfy tica bus they will take you across the border and the driver does all the hard work for you!  ,costa_rica,cegs2nl,1,t5_2s4n6

1591462,0,t3_2bzvso,I hiked through Corcovado with guides in June two day and one night hike.JuneJuly are tough conditions really heavy rains and lightning storms. We had to walk in several rivers for about half a kilometer as the banks were too steep and overgrown but that was also dangerous as we passed many a crocodile sunning themselves on the banks. Tapirs peccaries who were with young and very aggressive fer de lance bullet ants and illegal gold miners are all not fun. Only saw jaguar tracks in the sand no jaguars or pumas.I was at Sirena station for two days. If he went to Sirena the rangers would know about it as would other people who stayed or stopped there.

9536282,0,t3_5ar15c,Before we went to Puerto Viejo I read about the safety issues as well but everyone said that that was years ago and its safer now with the arrival of tourism police. But there is still somewhat of a safety issue...This is not meant to scare you off but we are in Puerto Viejo at the moment and were robbed at knife point the first evening we got here. Apparently walking home two people wasnt enough. My girlfriend ended up with a few cuts on her hand and we had to go to the emergency room.We were walking on the main road around pm and just needed to walk  meters from Lazy Moon. Just before we reached the sideroad where our hotel is someone came running up to us from the back with a knife.I know we might just have had bad luck as this can happen everywhere and weve been traveling around the world for  months now in far more dangerous places without anything happening but from what we heard at the police station there are still a lot of robberies and burglaries. Two days later a dude was robbed right after he got off the bus around pm.So take your precautions. Walk in groups take a taxi and dont bring anything valuable with you at night we only had a bit of cash.Like I said we were probably just very unlucky but there are far too many drug dealing gangster wannabe kids hanging around this town for my liking  but I guess that follows tourism in lots of places.At least they have tourism police right now but Im not sure how much that is helping when the robbers are dressed in black and have their face covered with no way of identifying them.,costa_rica,d9ojnnf,2,t5_2s4n6

They sent it to our next destination in Fortuna and the bag was already there when I arrived. I was very happy ofcourse!!! By the way its funny how was fast I did not care anymore about the bag ofcourse its inconvenient ofcourse its a lot of money although part is insured... But in the end its just stuff... And all you need is underwear shorts and socks and flipflops.. Which I bought in a local Walmart for less than . The only thing missing is my Petzl Carabiner  Kinda sad someone had to steal one thing...,costa_rica,dfp2e6t,1,t5_2s4n6
