As someone born and raised in Chicago I always laugh at how the show portrays Gibsons as a run of the mill bar when in fact its one of the higher end restaurants in the city. Protip Hugos Frog Bar next door shares a kitchen with Gibsons but is easier to get into and more relaxed. Plus you can get almost all the same steaks at a lower price. Still expensive but not as bad as Gibsons.,theleaguefx,cr2gwhf,5,t5_2sws5

And Taco  I used to love the character but hes gotten so ridiculous.
