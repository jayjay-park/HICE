42444,0,t3_1ujm9l,Reminds me of those races on Midnight Club DUB Edition where you could take an route you wanted to get to the other end of the city. Ill give this a try as soon as the BCS Title game is over,GTAContent,cej9hmf,1,t5_2zdmn

139393,0,t1_cet37ny,It depends on where you stand already on your Flippin Hells and Spinderella trophies.For Spinderellas Im getting RP I guess because I have platinum already.For Flippin Hells Im getting  or   still I think but Ive not Platinumed that one yet.Its not as fast as like RP glitches out there...but the ability to respawn and do another Spinderella every  seconds is moderately useful.,GTAContent,ceub1vp,1,t5_2zdmn

643684,0,t3_20ompc,Actually you can create spawns weapons and other objects on the white cabins. You just have to place them on the ground first and then pick them back up and put them on the cabin. I made a melee deathmatch on top of floating cabins. You have to jump from cabin to cabin. It was a bitch to make but it is my most popular deathmatch.,GTAContent,cgdfr60,1,t5_2zdmn

720531,0,t3_223t4o,Thanks very much all I have gone through and removed a bunch of the checkpoints.  I agree it plays heaps better without them.It does seem a bit sill that a race titled Chicanery didnt really feature any chicanes so I have added some in too and I think they work well.Thanks for the reviews!,GTAContent,cgm6ekg,2,t5_2zdmn

960785,0,t1_chdhvrh,This is what I want! Because of how the map is just one straight line it makes it almost impossible to get the bag if the enemy team does. So I need the clusterfuck so as to keep the game going,GTAContent,chdi0qy,1,t5_2zdmn
1116524,0,t1_chtrq1j,Just finished a game  much better now that the spawn distances are balanced. I gotta say mate your map has actually inspired my own idea  check out my post,GTAContent,chv7ils,2,t5_2zdmn

1493336,0,t3_2b1h13,I like it! The uturn is great nice and open. Too open though between  and  I felt like some sort of visual help is needed to complete this turn like a big prop or some tire stacks maybe. Overall . of  imo,GTAContent,cj3gqfa,3,t5_2zdmn

1614313,0,t1_cjims45,I thought about the sign and lower barrier idea as well but it cant really be done. Theres a  object limit and all the barriers are much shorter than the carriages so I ended up going with that. And the signs are so tiny that you cant pay attention to them while driving I tried my best with the checkpoints but I couldnt get it more understandable than that.I tried going most for the shape of it but the size I new wasnt an option at least in that space. I couldnt find another area for it and to be honest Im not sure there is a place to replicate the size and shape of the track without going over the  object limit.Id love to see a more accurate design but I havent saw it yet I saw  more tries to it here this one has the size of it but lacks the shape of it imo and here and I actually saw another one that I cant find now.Ill keep searching but for now I dont think Ill be able to come up with a more accurate one sorry to hear you didnt like it ,GTAContent,cjinfy8,1,t5_2zdmn
1665212,0,t1_cjp17mj,Glad you liked it I have only made it up to that check point using a Sandking Sanchez too easy and a Sultan. Going down is fun and real easy to get out of control. Thanks for the comment.,GTAContent,cjp28b1,1,t5_2zdmn

I havent had enough time to get really intimate with it like Ive wanted to but Im trying to make games that feel like The Last of Us.Anyways this job.  As you know I love it.  I have no complaints.  I hope it gets verified I feel it would be a great addition to the jobs.  But yes wtf is up with no marksman rifle?
