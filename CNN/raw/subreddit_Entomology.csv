1318849,0,t1_cihddey,When pinning them through the thorax dorsally all you need to make sure of is that the pin enters somewhat straight and at the proper location. A specimen like yours would be fine with a pin through the center although some are offset a bit to the right and dont worry too much because thats the way it is normally done and the insects hold up well especially with one as large as yours. Piercing multiple times however can damage them. I havent tried gluing one to a pin the way you describe. Typically those which are glued are attached to a piece of paper with a pin through it in a technique known as pointing. However this is usually reserved for the more minute insects. As long as the pin youre using allows you to balance the wasp on it you should be okay but I would just pin it from above. It will stay in shape and not tip to one side due to an imbalance in weight. At this point Id wait for it to dry in place before doing anything else with it.,Entomology,cihzk51,2,t5_2qygr
1381024,0,t1_cipd0g6,Those pictures are pretty good certainly good enough for us to know whether its a bee or not. Did you want us to tell you or do you still want to try to figure it out yourself?I would recommend you have a close look at the silverywhite hairs at the back of the thorax. You could also try having a look at some images of Nomada and solitary wasps to try to get an idea of the giss or gestalt of the two.Its very easy to have this trouble especially if its with a species youre unfamiliar with. A few years ago I thought a worn specimen of this tiny species which Id never seen before was a wasp.,Entomology,cipe96j,2,t5_2qygr

1787035,0,t1_ck48s23,gtAquatic insects breathe with gills. After oxygen diffuses from the water it passes into a branching network of eversmaller airways called tracheoles which deliver the gas directly to clumps of cells. Larvae can also absorb some oxygen through their soft exoskeleton.gtMolting takes their breath away. When larvae slip out of their exoskeleton the lining of the tracheoles comes with it. Its like having your lungs ripped out says Joseph Bernardo an ecologist at Texas AampM University College Station who was not involved in the research. Although it was fairly common knowledge among entomologists that the tracheal linings come outand likely block the trachea in the processthe impact on respiration hadnt been measured.The article seems to deal specifically with aquatic insects and mentions tracheal linings coming out.,Entomology,ck4epm3,1,t5_2qygr

Spitting spider running crab spider fishing spider jumping spider.Pedipalp structure is also very important to spider ID.The teeth of the chelicerae of a dwarf spider.It also takes video.Bonus butterfly scales... x and x are the two objective options when using the camera. One drawback is that the camera is higher power than the scopes eyepiece lenses what you look through vs. what snaps pics.  The cameras field of view on the wider setting is about . mm.  Its too close to get pics of the whole animal.  Second drawback is the halogen lamp gets too hot for live arthropods so I often use a  LED desk lamp from Target.  I also recommend CombineZP very straightforward freeware to stack images at varying depth of focus.Overall I find what I can see with this microscope and the images I can take adequate in the context of spider identification and admiration.
