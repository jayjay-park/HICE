10651482,0,t3_5sf6ap,firstly please stop popping your pimples!!!! itll cause scars and scabs and make it worse than is. second where do you have the acne mostly? where you have the most acne can be a definite answer as why you have it in first place. ,Skincare_Addiction,ddem9s6,2,t5_3fwbd
10937002,0,t3_5vebv8,I think its unlikely that CeraVe is the source of your breakouts. If you think it might be the cause I would try another moisturizer containing ceramides like Dr. Jart Ceramidin Liquid and Cream. These will help your dry skin without making you break out. I see you use a BHA formula in the morning before your CeraVe PM? BHAs make your skin extremely sensitive to the sun and it is crucial to wear sunscreen if you do! Sun exposure leads to skin damage which irritates your skin and eventually causes break outs. Your nighttime routine including the Aczone seems a little harsh. I have very dry and sensitive skin and was not impressed with Cliniques moisture surge extended relief or moisture surge overnight mask. I highly recommend the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Intense Hydration Cream andor the Ultra Repair HydraFirm Sleeping Cream if you need a night cream This is for all skin types and provides long term hydration without being greasy. I would definitely recommend the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair cream over any Clinique or CeraVe moisturizer. I would also add a toner to your regime after your cleanser. What is your makeup routine? The type of cleanser you should use depends on this. ,Skincare_Addiction,de82prc,1,t5_3fwbd

11173016,0,t3_5ziwsw,I had a very similarsounding little rashy patch recently same place from reacting to the metal in a necklace. No regular moisturizer helped much nor did hydrocortisone on its own. I finally used pure rosehip oil sometimes mixed with a bit of very lowstrength cortisone .  if youre using it for a few consecutive days its gentler to use a lower strength if I thought of it. Ive used argan oil before too for similar issues. No idea if these would help you but they tend to be the only thing that helps when I get a stubborn scaly spot. Good luck!,Skincare_Addiction,deyg6cr,1,t5_3fwbd
