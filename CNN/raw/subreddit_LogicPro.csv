2718365,0,t1_cmsfzo1,Thats a ghost side chain if Im not mistaken? You can also do this by using ultrabeat by doing the same as what was just previously explained by keeping the sequencer activated on ultrabeat and then changing the output to no output.,LogicPro,cnd2epr,1,t5_2x5ey
4945064,0,t1_cuhpd6z,I think I found out what was up  I had some of my plugins in Userlibraryaudioplugins ect instead of in Macintosh HDlibraryaudioplugins. I havent had any issues so far. This never used to be a problem so maybe for now on plugins go there. I got super scared...plugins arent cheap!,LogicPro,cuhv5ln,2,t5_2x5ey
5197148,0,t1_cvbuuku,The BassInput goes to gt Buss  and the Send from BassInput also goes to gt Buss . Either theres phase cancellation that cancels out the signal or Logic thinks its a self feeding loop and switches it off Logic is indeed capable of detecting and muting selffeed loops.What you should do instead isBassInput with no Output but two Sends to different Busses.  Those two busses can then go to StereoOut or another Buss. Im pretty confident that this will work.Also I would recommend not to turn the Send volume over  db. On your picture theyre turned up as far as possible which is never a good idea.,LogicPro,cvcg79g,1,t5_2x5ey
6392329,0,t1_czg60w8,Thanks Ill probably try that. Still it boggles my mind I think a lot of people put distortion on drums especially in DnB and its just kind of ridiculous to have it set so high. Could really damage someones gear,LogicPro,czg8pan,1,t5_2x5ey
