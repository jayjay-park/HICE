1142534,0,t1_chy0mkf,Nowhere in the Constitution does it explicitly state that you cant make enabling acts.  My case is that it is unconstitutional is built upon the following parts of the Constitution. Article V  This Constitution... shall be the supreme Law of the Land.  The Members of the Legislature the Executive Councilors  and all Judicial Officers shall be bound to support this Constitution.  Laws which disagree with the Constitution cannot stand. Article  Section   The Legislature shall have the power... To hold a Vote of Impeachment for a Councilor to remove him or her from the Executive Council ... And To pass Resolutions to overturn an Order made by the Executive Council  Thus this law would be stripping away powers explicitly given to the Legislature by the Constitution. Article III Section   The Chief Justice shall have the power... To overturn Laws Orders or Resolutions of the Legislature or Executive Orders found to be in conflict with this Constitution  Again this law would strip away powers explicitly given to the Chief Justice by the Constitution.So I would declare this to be unconstitutional on the basis that it supercedes the Constitution in its organization of power.  The only way to change constitutionally given power or anything in the Constitution is through a constitutional amendment See Article IV.,Civcraft_Orion,chy5a33,1,t5_2x6ia
