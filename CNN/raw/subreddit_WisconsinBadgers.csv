620002,0,t3_2177ny,Baylor is a though matchup but they all are at this stage right?  I watched what I could handle of the BUCreighton game and came away impressed with BU.  Brust and Hayes will be key.  Hayes is reliable at  feet.  If Frank the Tank can create space by moving outside and there should be ample passing lanes through the zone. ,WisconsinBadgers,cgaqtx3,4,t5_2slo5

2561428,0,t1_cmsir4d,I get it any one person isnt going to muddy the water but if you start letting them all in then it could be come a problem.

2570219,0,t1_cmtjive,Im the opposite. At least Bret lost a ton of assistants and it was clear he was upset with the program. Gary has been here for only  years and knew what type of hand he was being dealt. So the fact that he used to preach about the team being a family and fighting for each other pisses me off more than Bret ever could. Just seems way more shady and cowardly to me,WisconsinBadgers,cmu2dsj,4,t5_2slo5

4660100,0,t1_cthux2z,You dont hear about them losing recruits because they dont even pursue those who cant get in at least not for long. They didnt have a coach who thought he was above admissions rules. We should be back to normal from now on. If Im wrong about this and it keeps happening under Chryst I will unhappily eat my words and start blaming admissions. But my gut is telling me it was Andersen screwing things up by telling kids they could get in when he knew they couldnt.,WisconsinBadgers,cthynnh,10,t5_2slo5

The Badgers will lose seniors Corey Clement and Dare Ogunbowale leaving James to compete with Taiwan Deal and Bradrick Shaw for a starting position.Luckily for me  I was hoping there was a way that I didnt have to sit out a year said James. But it works out in my favor. Theres some guys ahead of me but when theyre gone Im the upperclassmen in the room.

Say ohio state wins and so do we and then we go on to beat Penn StateClemson wins outWashington wins outAlabama whatever even if they lose a game theyre inThat puts the top  in the country? Alabama  Ohio State  Clemson  Washington And make no mistake that will be the playoff despite the fact that we beat  top  teams and played ..  I mean how can we jump OSU when they jst beat the  team in the country and beat us in Camp RandallAnd no matter the sched.   wins is way worse than ..  sucks.  EVEN THOUGH WED WIPE THE FLOOR WITH WASHINGTON And we are more than capeable of beating clemson. We need Michigan to beat OSU and beat them in the B Ship..
