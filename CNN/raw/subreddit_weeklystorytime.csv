Everyone except Emi Ibarazaki and the new violethaired transfer student.So new girl... whyre you here? Emi planted her hands on the purplehaired girls desk and leaned down at her. Shed been here for a week and hadnt said a word to anyone as far as Emi had seen and shed been trying to keep an eye on her. She was kind of cute in a mysterious sort of way.The new girl raised her head just enough to look Emi in the face sighed and brushed hair out of her face. It fell back almost instantly and she didnt mess with it a second time. ... I have emotional problems and was referred here I was told Yamaku Academy might help me get... better.That was blunt. And her delivery... unnervingly flat. Overactingserialkiller flat. No way in hell that was real. She had to have some kind of neurological disease or something and was just fucking with... er... everyone... maybe not.Oh yeah? We dont get many like you here. Emi straightened up and gestured at her prosthetic legs. Mostly kids with physical problems a few that are here to learn sign language... She scratched her head and tried to smile but she was finding it difficult for some reason. What crossed her lips was a forced Jokerlike smirk that she quickly suppressed by looking at the floor and shuffling her feet awkwardly. Actually Ive been here for a couple years and I think youre the only person with emotional baggage as their only excuse for being here.Purplegirl just stared at her.  Jesus what the fuck is her deal? Did she watch someone get run over by a truck? ... did she run someone over with a truck? Im uh... IIm Emi. She held out a hand hoping the girl in front of her wouldnt like tear it off and eat it or something.Surprisingly the new girl timidly brought one of her hands up from her lap and shook Emis hand. Im... Hanako. She let go of the other girls hand much quicker than shed taken it returning her own to her lap. Im sorry Im... quiet. The doctors told me I was catatonic for uhm... mmonths. Words are hard sometimes.Well its a start... Oh uh... its... its okay. Sorry to come off so brusque... Bet you know something about that huh? Would you like maybe go get tea with me sometime?Uhm... maybe. I dont remember what friends are like... really... She was trying now for sure. Shed lifted her head the rest of the way up to look at Emi face to face. Its been... its been a long time.Oh thats okay! I can totally teach you how to be normal again! ... That came out wrong and I dont think I can say anything to save it...Maybe you can make it up to me over tea sometime soon. Hanako smiled and stood up. Sometime tomorrow?Uhm... uhm... yeahsureokay. Emis face was bright red and she couldnt make eye contact after her last comment. I should go.Thank god she was the head of the track team. She powerwalked out of the room and around the corner before sprinting back to the dorms.,weeklystorytime,ckjoa2k,2,t5_33kbq
