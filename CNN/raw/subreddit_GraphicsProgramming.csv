3149252,0,t1_cooe3nl,Personally I prefer this compendium over the book. The book is too focused on the GRDF which only seems to be used by researchers at KU Leuven yet it almost completely skips Veachs Path Integral framework.This compendium is really nice to have when writing a renderer as many important and useful formulas can be found in there. The formulas arent hidden in walls in text so its easy to find the ones you need.,GraphicsProgramming,coof0il,1,t5_36tba
3150291,0,t1_cooi1pj,gt Like my early example with floating point hardware sure you could write a software floating point but when every single machine has hardware that is easier faster and less bugprone why even bother?I cant think of a practical one. But i can think of lots of fun ones. The homebrew scene is alive and well for a lot of older console systems. Doing a simple  poly or less game on the Sega genesis could be fun. The GBA scene is still active. If you are working with an embedded Linux that doesnt have any video hardware acceleration or are doing something directly with the framebuffer device. You are aiming for a low res look and feel like you are trying to emulate an old school PlayStation RPG. The old ps didnt have a zbuffer. You want super low res paletized textures. The sheer accomplishment of doing it yourself. Did you know people are still building their own computers out of chips?  Its just fun.,GraphicsProgramming,cooiwds,2,t5_36tba
3153850,0,t1_coov7h5,Well I cant really change the internal rendering engine with shaders.  The only thing the shader mod does is integrate them in the system. But again OptiFine changes the rendering engine quite a bit.,GraphicsProgramming,coow7hc,1,t5_36tba

3351455,0,t1_cp9clvz,They are neither points nor squaresrectangles. They are samples of a continuous signal which has been quantized The paper in question demonstrates this very well.Other signals than graphicslight are quantized and used all the time and no one describe those as squares. Raw audio data for example. Why not?When reconstructing audio signals for playback the box filter is the worst one you can use for playback. Even linear interpolation between samples is better.The idea here is that the final representation  visualization of discrete samples is separate from the samples themselves. And the original signal is not represented exactly by the samples alone.,GraphicsProgramming,cpaah7y,2,t5_36tba
3677968,0,t1_cqbgc1e,Good advice here. Let me just add to it.Most interviews Ive been through especially at game companies are still depressingly algorithmheavy. Get some practice at home solving all those typical interview problems before applying. For rendering also focus on linear algebra and really understand those rayX intersections and dotcross product fundamentals. Write as much C as possible to become as comfortable as you can with the language.PBRT is an excellent book. I strongly recommend to learn at least the basics of physicallybased shading. Naty Hoffmans SIGGRAPH course slides and notes are highly recommended. As are all the other slides and course notes in each years course.,GraphicsProgramming,cqbigey,6,t5_36tba

4066938,0,t1_crjp4mm,Clearing before drawing should implicitly skip reloading the onchip buffer with the previous frames contents.  That should be a bit faster.Even better is to explicitly indicate that you will not be needing the previous frames contents using Through that extension you are also able to explicit skip copying the depth buffer out of onchip RAM.  It wont be displayed or reloaded so why bother even moving it offchip?Some more info ,GraphicsProgramming,crjuyb5,2,t5_36tba

4766413,0,t3_3g5oa7,Well I started with this like  years ago when there only was Directx . The guy explain well some things others not so well His coding techniques arent the best I mean they do work they do explain but later on your development you will found them weak in structure.You should check them out the author set exercises at the end of every chapter and its kind of motivating I really enjoyed at the time those tutorials. Other good place was the one of Chad Vernon is way better in some regards it should complement.After this I started to look at the Directx SDK Samples implement the techniques in my own way. Its a good place to start. IF you need to move to OpenGL it wont be hard its the same thing at the bottom buffers shader programs etc. The API is way different.If you decide to start with those tutorials of Directx keep in mind that the DXT helper libraries wont be there with Directx nor OpenGL so dont marry your code with those libraries as I did at the time that was a painful mistake because I needed to re write the entire MathVector library when I moved to OpenGL ES.EDIT  I have some time so Ill keep writing.Tutorials are just like the starter of a car you need it but it wont run all the time. This analogy is because at some point people expect to get tutorials for everything and thats not how this works you need to learn the basics but once you start moving to more advanced topics you will not find tutorials or they will lack some info. Get used to the next step would be articles they dont share source not very common they dont do your homework you need to read understand and implement it by yourself this is the case of the books Shader X for example. After articles the next step are papers but your mathematical background must be higher to understand them well.One thing is mandatory here dont just read code it! If you just read is not enough you will forget what you read or you wont know even if you understood well what you read. So code it if you didnt get it you will know it because this is one of the great things of computer graphics you can SEE what you are doing there are several ways to debug your output so when a shadow doesnt look right you will know it right the way the hard part is to figure it out why. The hardest part for me was skeletal animation combined with physics like the rag doll you need to understand very well matrices and hierarchies. Another complex topic was the deferred rendering the theory is simple enough but implement well the pipeline is hard it take a lot of time but its fun nonetheless. Shadow maps are tricky as well I mean get them right.At the end I still feel like a newbie in a lot of topics for instance I want to write my own ray tracer for global illumination make my own light maps for precomputed lighting but one of these days...,GraphicsProgramming,ctvclyo,4,t5_36tba

7305971,0,t3_4fbzz2,Physically based rendering is just attempting to mimic how light behaves in the real world. One key aspect of PBR is that the amount of light leaving a surface is never more than the amount entering it and the PBR shading algorithms ensure this stays true. When trying to mimic a material rather than playing around with various combinations of diffuse and specular that dont quite correspond to the real world you can specify the real world absorption and roughness of a material and get a result that looks similar.,GraphicsProgramming,d28n16a,1,t5_36tba

10730106,0,t1_ddlsyx2,It really depends on the game. For some games physics is important for others not so much. Same goes for animation some have heavier requirements.A lot of games will budget something like  characters on the screen maybe  loaded and active in close proximity. Other games will have crowds. Obviously depending where on the spectrum the game lies more or less work is required to scale.Same goes for physics some games just have ragdolls and a few things that might break. Others have full on destruction everywhere.Depending on the game the physics budget might be ms on the main thread while animation might take up to ms. This is only from what Ive seen YMMV. Thankfully animation tends to parallelize fairly easily and most physics middlewares are somewhat decent although they do not all scale equally.If you are curious I did a whole blog series on character animation compression. Ill be presenting a new techniquetwist at the GDC  this month which focused on saving a bit of memory and us per animation clip we decompressed. This is representative of the scale of things in AAA for animation it takes a lot of work now to save a few cycles.,GraphicsProgramming,ddmqasv,1,t5_36tba
