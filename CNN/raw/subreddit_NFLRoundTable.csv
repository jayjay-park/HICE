668347,0,t1_cgfsx85,gtId rather see us sign Owen Daniels and not draft a TE at all this yearThis is exactly how I feel about our TE situation. I was originally hoping we would look into Pitta but the Ravens resigned him. Toilolo is still way too raw to be counted on as our TE and Daniels is the best available receiving TE on the market. I also dont think Daniels would be that expensive. I am guessing he would be willing to accept a contract similar to Brandon Meyers  yr  . M. That would give Toilolo the opportunity to take over the starting job or allow the Falcons draft another TE in . I think I would rather focus on getting a safety in the second round rather than committing a draft pick to a TE.

1721927,0,t3_2e564j,Of course having and developing a capable backup is absolutely important but its not that easy for teams without a stable starter.Take the Browns for example they havent been able to have any QBs wait in the wings and learn because theres no one to learn from. Imagine if Hoyer struggles this season. The masses would call for Manziel to come in and play media circus aside this argument could be made for any first round QB. But now look at the Patriots. If Brady goes through a slow stretch will people clamor for Garoppolo? Of course not because they have their franchise QB in Tom Brady.I know its unfair because a franchise QB is such a desirable position but these teams have the most opportunity to train a backup without thrusting them into the starting spot. They get the chance to let these guys wait in the wings for years and get comfortable with the offense and the other offensive players. But a team without a QB is plagued and any promising young QB will be thrust into the spotlight.

2179093,0,t3_2jyvv9,I think it was pretty clear that the level of performance Foles exhibited in late  was unsustainable  there was always going to be some regression to the mean.  His stats were just too far beyond what anyone had ever done on a sustained basis for there not to be an element of luck there  and as others have noticed he was going up against pretty poor pass defenses for a lot of those games.That said I was expecting him to regress to still pretty good  not necessarily among the leagues elite but certainly above league average and that kind of hasnt happened.  He and Geno Smith are probably the poorest  QBs not actively fighting for their starting job so far this season.There is probably some element of luck in this too much as he was not as good as he looked in  he probably isnt as bad as he has looked so far in .However I wonder if a big part of it is just that teams are starting to catch up to the Chip Kelly offense.  Last year it was new an innovative and they put up some huge numbers with it but as teams start to adjust to it its advantage may diminish.  The Eagles offense as a whole  not just Foles but everyone across the team  is not performing as well as last year and its basically never looked as good as it did in that first game against the Redskins last year.  This is not to say the system is not viable but I think it did initially benefit from being new and different until teams caught up with it.

5499571,0,t3_3qbzmz,Is a QB good enough isnt a binary question.  The QB is the most important position on the team but there are obviously examples of teams doing very well with mediocre or worse QB play.  Its just tougher to have a successful team without a top QB but a team can win at any level without stellar QB play.If the question is whether the Rams specifically are good enough to win at those levels then in my opinion the answer is yes. Theyve gone  so far but have played a reasonably difficult schedule.  But they still have games left against SF CHI BAL DET TB and SF and they should be even or better shots to win all those games particularly with Gurley lighting it up.The question in my mind is not Foles but Jeff Fisher.  Theres a reason Fishers teams have been within two games of . in  of his  seasons as a coach he coaches so conservatively that even games against bad teams usually turn into pretty tight contests.  If the Rams had a coach that wasnt afraid to open it up and take chances then Foles would be plenty adequate for the Rams to do well considering the talent on the rest of their roster.,NFLRoundTable,cwemeku,8,t5_30tva

I think youre confusing I need to cheer for the local team with We now have a local team to cheer for which I think was closer to their point when they were talking about the prestige of a city.,NFLRoundTable,cy1ah5b,3,t5_30tva

6265379,0,t1_cz1klhp,No the new coin toss and selection of sides is to decide who gets the ball to start. Theres no other way to handle it. You cant just give it to one team and hypothetically if the team possessing the ball at the end of the fourth gets position to start OT there would be no incentive to score before the end of the game. So by selecting new sides and a new coin flip it gives the teams an incentive at the end of the game to try to win and not rely on OT. Its an extension to resolve the tie. ,NFLRoundTable,cz1sy2s,1,t5_30tva

6437208,0,t3_43hcb9,How many black kickers do you see in college? Thats nearly  teams just in the FBS and its rare to see. Also its not that uncommon to white kickers or punters at HBCU schools. With so few kickers developing in college that leaves even fewer potential kickers to make it to the NFL.,NFLRoundTable,czl596q,1,t5_30tva

6700903,0,t3_479phw,I dont think this is really a big deal. It sounds like the NFL withheld revenue that it thought it was able to withhold and during an audit the union discovered this and thought the revenue shouldnt have been withheld so they went to arbitration where is was decided that the revenue shouldnt have been withheld from the shared revenue between the league and players. That sounds like it worked out how the CBA designed discrepancies like that to work. I think the only thing it will affect in the next CBA negotiation is the amount of detail that is used to talk about which revenue doesdoesnt get shared between the league and the players.,NFLRoundTable,d0cfjiw,1,t5_30tva

8882721,0,t1_d7f5ndk,The NFL is not a normal workplace. Their industry is very public and in such public industries the right to free speech is often unofficially extended into the workplace because so much of what they say is for public consumption. Theres a disconnect between asking athletes and actors to connect with the public as part of their job while also censoring what they say in that capacity and the expectations of the public enforce this. So while Kaep has no free speech rights while performing the fans dont want to be told that and the NFL doesnt want to cross that line. And they will if a player disparages the league or a referee while performing and the public is much more accepting of that. So while youre technically correct for the purpose of this conversation Kaepernick is exercising his free speech rights right up until the point that the NFL says he cant. At that point the issue wouldnt be whether or not Kaep has the right to speak he doesnt but whether or not the NFL is right to restrict his speech.,NFLRoundTable,d7fkskn,2,t5_30tva
9503222,0,t1_d9k8y99,gt You are using a very NFL centric mindset thinking that the talent level must be horrible in the CFL. Since your only reasoning for that is that its not the NFL.Do you understand what the CFL is made up of? They dont have their own secret stash of players its not the Soviet national hockey team. Theyre NFL training camp cuts undrafted free agents who couldnt even make it into a training camp etc.Any notion that the talent level is NFL caliber is just selfdelusion.gt You also forgot that Warren Moon couldnt get a shot to be QB in the NFL. The exception that proves the rule.  . Its not  anymore.  Individual players in the CFL may have untapped NFLcaliber talent. As a group its not even close enough to merit this conversation.,NFLRoundTable,d9kh3kt,8,t5_30tva

9851316,0,t3_5g5lmr,I dont know whether they should fire him since I dont know follow the Rams closely but I will say this. Teams should look deeply at the situation and not just fire a coach because of their win loss record. By design half of the teams are going to win and half are going to lose. So even a good coach can fall into situations where their roster sucks and they are in a tough division.Fisher has never had a QB in St. Louis Bradford got injured twice in preseason. I actually think hovering around  in that division has been a success due to what he inherited and the superbowl contenders that have been in that division.That being said it may be that Fisher sucks. If he really didnt know the Patriots RBs thats a really bad sign. I just think most people arent looking at it beyond hurr durr his team lost too many games he should be fired,NFLRoundTable,darndrc,3,t5_30tva
