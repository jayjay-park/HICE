10242504,0,t1_dc4zzws,Haha be careful with those quick accelerations. Bought the ScatPack on Tuesday. Friday I got a reckless driving ticket for spinning tires at a red light... In freaking North Carolina of all places. The worst state to get a ticket in!! Before I put some big meaty tires on the  RT I made this video Doing a few quick burnouts ... On private property... In Mexico. Nothing too spectacular but various camera angles. And I agree  miles is nothing these days.. which reminds me I guess Im past my breakin period now at  miles... Like I was ever going to drive it easy ,Challenger,dc51mfy,1,t5_2wojr

10867717,0,t1_ddznu21,I emailed my dealer about this  days after I bought her this is what he said.gtJust spoke with my Head parts Manager Taylor. Apparently they are not serviceable through Chrysler considering the wiring and panels are completely different. Because if you have seen on the . screen most of everything is digital air controls etc. etc. As opposed to your vehicle where there are actual knobs and buttons. It can be done aftermarket through Car Toys. But as far as up here Chrysler does not do them. Not because it cannot be done but they wouldnt be able to grantee the work considering it would have to be a refurbished radio different panel and different wiring. I just looked it up they are starting at  at Car Toys not including labor. Taylor said most people that request that he refers to Car Toys so apparently they do this often because the obvious financial gain of doing it aftermarket.I replied with itll be a cold day in hell before I go back to car toys.,Challenger,de0xevw,2,t5_2wojr

11133853,0,t3_5yvuxv,If I was looking for a v muscle car I would go with a Challenger GT no questions.  But thats what works for me.  Have you tried driving a few of your other options?  A few minutes behind the wheel can help with this decision.  Once you get past the exterior the interior is where you spend all your time and there are cars out there that are too cramped too cheap feeling and too...

11741279,0,t3_67jliy,Depending on the year wrapping the trim panels in white or any variation of white pearl would look cool.  If you are a DIY person you can look up and buy samples from metrorestyling.com.  Ive been ordering their . samples for months now on various projects it really helps to see the color in person and in many different light sources before committing to a roll.  ...sometimes they have too many options  Ive seen on one of my facebook groups where someone had the seats and door leather replaced with white.  Looked cool but the maintenance on that has to be insane.  Again depending on your year Barton makes beautiful color shifters both for auto and manual.  My theme is orange here is my Barton with Speed Dawg shift knob.  ampnbspTuners can get expensive especially if you need to get an unlocked PCM if you re going to invest that much cash you would of course also want a custom tune .  I would research what other people have gained with their tunes and see if its worth it. ,Challenger,dgqwjs0,3,t5_2wojr
