And the alt post is hardly less visible.  Its  on the hot page for christs sake.  No one is going to miss it. Reread that reddiquette item.  The key words there are you and think.  Have you considered that maybe other people dont think that post contributes to this sub?  Or at least in the way they want posts to contribute to this sub?  This is how reddit works.
