6195706,0,t3_40c854,Depends on the style of bike. Racers will make you lean forward which puts more stress on the groin. Anything you sit straight up on will generally be fine. Cruisers and big tourers often have a more laid back cushion that frees up the groin completely.Also the you need to grip with your legs is a bit... exaggerated. Dont get me wrong you do but its more a sentence that tries to stress that you dont use your hands to hold on to the bike. You use your hands for steering. Steering whilst trying to hold on is a bad idea. The actual leggriping required really isnt that much until you start doing track days or other highspeed cornering.,motobe,cytvwnj,2,t5_38d1l
6212182,0,t3_40c854,not if you do it right. Once landed a stoppy wrong that kinda hurt though PAbout the legs you just keep them tight around the bike to push it and gain more control. you dont have to have your bike in a deathgrip. you have to sit relaxed on your bike to have control!,motobe,cyvrb20,2,t5_38d1l
6346780,0,t3_42hivk,Good luck with the license. I went the same route as you.  months on a cc did my lessons bought my new bike got my license picked up my new bike. The exam shouldnt be an issue. The manoeuvres is just a matter of repetition and you should already have the street part covered. Protip the extramanoeuvre during the street exam means you need to park somewhere. Nobody mentioned this to me on my first go so I didnt know what the examinator meant. It sucked.,motobe,czb247p,2,t5_38d1l

9064366,0,t1_d8175yu,Also when you get insurancedoctor papers asking if youre okay you can write onder voorbehoud on it my brother was also given this advice iirc.

9151653,0,t1_d8c05gd,Not really a hard way but suddenly you are driving on the wrong side of the road in a bend fumbling to find how you turn on your big lights looking for potholes and lose stones. But uxa was riding along we had a dull ride eventually. Still nice to blow of some steam in the port of antwerp!,motobe,d8c1e0k,3,t5_38d1l
9751255,0,t1_daf1ivj,gt Well imho the car driver is not at fault.Its remarkable that you say such a thing without any sort of comprehensive context. Im all for blaming the motorcyclist if the motorcyclist is actually at fault but in this case we really dont know. The story just doesnt give a complete picture.gtgt Net toen hij een inhaalmanoeuvre uitvoerde sloeg een Ford Transit die in dezelfde richting reed vlak voor hem linksaf.When you ride your car do you always look in your leftside mirror when turning left? As a motorcyclist I do it sometimes. ,motobe,daf23rh,1,t5_38d1l

10018105,0,t3_5j4mnc,I had to go to some christmas concert last saturdaynight in a church so I decided to not wear my leather pants and go with my jeans. Boy was that a mistake... my upper legs were still icecold an hour after I got home and being under a blanket. Then it started to hurt after I got some feeling back.Luckiky I received my heated gloves in the mail last week. I bought some last year battery powered and they broke down during the summer so I contacted the seller and they just sent me two brand new gloves without asking to send the broken ones back or add proof. It may not mean much for companies but that sign of trust that they believe you on your word really increases my satisfaction with certain brands.,motobe,dbddyjo,4,t5_38d1l
