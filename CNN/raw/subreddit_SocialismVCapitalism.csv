6440704,0,t1_czlf52e,Lets say the revolution happens tomorrow.  Workers stay in their current jobs with democratic control over them with the exception of cops marketing defense and all jobs that only exist to hoard surplus.  Land that is not currently being used can be evaluated for use as farmland.  Unemployed individuals can be put to work on growing and transporting the crop.  The food would then be freely available at distribution centers.  If we think about this in terms of bourgeois economics this would amount to driving the price of a commodity to .The reason that the ECP is a faulty argument is because it misses the goal of socialism the point is to overproduce to destroy profit.

6508201,0,t3_44n0pa,Political correctness is an interesting concept that there is thought that is subversive to the status quo and should be repressed in favor of thought that affirms it.Which is why it was very clever for the status quo to appropriate the idea and spread the idea that the status quo itself e.g. white supremacy is not PC so as to crowd out actual subversive ideas e.g. anarchism.This of course is very evident in the media where affirmation of misogyny white supremacy etc gets a decent bit of airtime with this wink and nod that its not PC. Meanwhile youre guaranteed that anyone who suggests anything genuinely politically incorrect like say dissolving the police will never be seen in any major outlet ever.Political correctness is a bandaid on the wound of actual racism applied by a capitalist society to take away our possibility of dissentFunny enough I find those who complain about outrage culture are the most likely to be outraged.,SocialismVCapitalism,czshwzn,5,t5_3c4n9

6581494,0,t1_d000raq,gtNo it doesnt. Why on earth would you think that suicide helps the socialist cause? Who exactly does this persons suicide help? What did they accomplish by doing this? Why is throwing your life away something to look up to?The funeral of Jan Palach an anonymous unknown student was attended by  people and sparked weeks of protests and public demonstrations.  He immediately became a hero of the cause of Czech liberation and was an inspiration to an entire generation that would follow him. years after his death a public remembrance for Jan Palach again ignited a week of protests and demonstrations against the Soviet state now known as Palach Week and is widely consider the beginning of the Velvet Revolution that peacefully ended Soviet rule of Czechoslovakia.So I guess it accomplished a lot.Or we could look at the example of Thch Qung c whose decision to selfimmolate brought the oppression of Dien government to world attention and forced Dien to the table.  When Dien failed to follow through on his promises five more monks set themselves on fire triggering Diens own military to overthrow and assassinate him.  I suspect a lot more monks would have died if theyd armed up and tried to seize the capital.gtIf suicide is your answer to the question of what should we do to fight capitalism and help the working class you are seriously out of touch with peoples struggles in general.Youre the one who brought it up not me.

6589006,0,t1_d00de00,Part .  Prices do not drop because of less labor.  They drop because of more output.  Prices are the intersection of supply and demand.  An increase in real supply will reduce prices all else equal because as the saying goes the same amount of money is chasing more and more goods.  A given unit of money can buy more and more goods.  Similarly a decrease in the supply of goods will increase prices all else equal because the same amount of money is chasing fewer goods.  Automation is the use of more capital in the labor process. Contrary to your claim it is not true that the rise of automation is synonymous with a fall in the amount of labor expended.  People today working  hour weeks with the use of computers and robots not available  years ago are not working less than people who worked  hour weeks did.  Labor per unit certainly dropped and yet prices have dramatically risen.  Prices have risen because of inflation of the money supply has outstripped the rise in the supply of goods.  More money I chasing less than more goods over time.  .  Homesteading is by definition acquisition and changing of previously unoccupied lands.  Anarchocapitalism contrary to your claim is not a historical account.  It is not a claim of how lands came to be owned today.  It is an ethic which is a priori.  What is demonstrably false is your insinuation that all land the world over was originally collectively owned.  This is false because humans have not even today homesteaded all lands.  There are still millions of square miles that have never been homesteaded at all.  Vast territories in Russia the Antarctic the Arctic the American Midwest Africa Asia and South America are still unoccupied.  It would be absurd to claim that should you or anyone else or any group of people go out and homestead the land build farms houses and raise livestock and grow crops either socialistically or anarchocapitalistically that they would be stealing from any existing owners.  Yes individuals have historically robbed others of lands.  This is true for both Capitalists and Socialists.  Theft is not an activity limited to nonsocialists.  In fact historically speaking Socialists have outnumbered Capitalists in stealing other peoples lands.  The entire Socialist experiments during the th century involved the purging of people from their lands that far FAR outnumbered the total number of every Native American in US territory who was listed from their homesteaded lands.  But again this is not relevant to the question of the internal consistency or economic productiveness of Socialism.  Your last sentence by the way is a contradiction to what you said earlier.  You said earlier that as long as anarchocapitalists acquire land via homesteading or trade that there is no justification to take anything from them.  But now you claim that it would be justified for people to engage in theft namely the very people who agreed to live anarchocapitalistically namely those who agreed to earn a fixed income in exchange for labor.,SocialismVCapitalism,d00uv20,1,t5_3c4n9

In the s the Climate Cult was obsessed with Global Cooling or the fact that the ignition switch was already addressed by Milton Friedman himself.gt The fact that all of these did happen under capitalism does not show that capitalism was necessary or even sufficient for these to innovations to occur.The historical GDP of planet earth would disagree with you. It took centuries before the yoke that went on the horses back and not the neck was invented and even more years before the plow was steeltipped. Only in the last  centuries has there been any real economic growth and innovation that took more than generations to become widespread.

Youll find cases where the business owner is not only involved in product creation they were working on it years before there were any employees. Microsoft Apple Google Reddit Youtube to name a few. If youre willing to concede that point and I dont see how you can deny it you have to create seperate classes of business ones that could be run alone by employees and ones that require the input of the original owner or product creator. You also have to explain what the motivation is to create this new product or enterprise if once established it just gets given away to the employees.The point is that the owners dont need to own in order to work. All of those would function just fine as employee controlled enterprises.gtYou gain property either by creating it yourself or convincing others to part with theirs.Sure but why does that give you the right to extract rent for it?

11463543,0,t1_dfv9wnu,The answer to what now? is pretty simple. If the leader of Bev is smart enough he would set up a liberal democratic system. Liberal as in the powers of government are defined and limited. Democratic as in it represents the people. The hypothetical is problematic for two reasons. One it seems to assume that this guy is a dictator and that there will be a power vaccuum if he dies leaving the door open for a cruel despot.And why ask the question in the first place unless you assume that socialism is somehow incompatible with democracy?Two young countries or young governments are prone to coups and dictatorships whether they are socialist or capitalist or whatever. The US democracy is solid right now because we have had  years for our institutions to cement themselves and the idea of representation is ingrained in our culture. And our economy is strong enough that a radical situation like that probably wouldnt develop.So really I think the deciding factor for me would be how important is the leader of Bevs commitment to democracy. Is he really a man of the people. And how important is it for the masses to have a democracy. And if its really a socalist revolution then thats something you need to have. Socialism is about control by the people not control by the government.,SocialismVCapitalism,dfvdw1d,1,t5_3c4n9
