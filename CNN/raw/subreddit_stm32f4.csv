Generally you will want to set the is peripheral in receive mode and then receive a buffer from the UDA. I think this will be a case of read the docs till youre blue in the face. ,stm32f4,ciubwhu,1,t5_2wrlr
2422712,0,t1_cmb46wv,Ah ok. Ive used IC with it but I havent really done a big project yet. Another option you could consider is to use it with an RTOS. Ive used ChibiOS on my discovery board a little bit. I know its pretty fast.. again havent used for any big projects but I know people who have.Youll have to setup a compiler and it might take a little longer than getting started with MBED but I think I got it all going in an hour or two. and Im fairly new to all this as well,stm32f4,cmb5m40,1,t5_2wrlr
