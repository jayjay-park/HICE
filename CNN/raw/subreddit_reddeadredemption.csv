3602315,0,t3_31lra0,I think its a mix between a bitter taste left after the ending and Jacks voice not being on par with John.I personally dont mind him even though I like John more. To me its just about attachment to the character. The only interaction weve had with Jack up to this point is him complaining about Johns parenting rightfully so and getting himself into trouble. I do find Jack to be a good character though. Having him be a shadow of his father would be rather far fetched as his father has barely been around. This all makes sense from a story perspective. But when we change from rugged badass John to what we currently know as his unexperienced son... its sort of a downgrade. Even if Jack seems more than capable of taking care of himself.I do think a lot of people are overeacting though. I wouldnt have the ending be any other way. Ending it all playing through his son does feel fitting. ,reddeadredemption,cq2w18e,3,t5_2rn7o

9315243,0,t3_581ll5,Why wouldnt you want RD Online to be like GTA Online? Think about it GTAO has a fairly extensive level creator where you can set up cool races and death match maps and shit. Imagine that in an old west setting yeah it wouldnt be upside down stunt car racing but it would still be cool if we could make our very own death match maps like a close quarters shootout map. Or maybe we could set up games where we can use our lassos to maybe get shit into holes and score points if they implement lassoing physics objects in the world like barrels and cans and stuff which would be awesome. And the heists oh boy the heists would be something else. Train robberies? Old West Bank robberies? Geez man playing all that with my friends would be FUCKIN awesome. I appreciated the simple gameplay of Red Dead Redemptions multiplayer. You drop into the world you can join with a posse of strangers or friends it wasnt a permanent gang but it was cool for a little while to wreak havoc in a group. Just think of the crew system from GTAO if it was implemented in the new Red Dead.

9319330,0,t1_d8xa4va,gt First theyre  different series.Well obviously but theyre made by the same company and seem to be following similar titling conventions so I think theres a comparison to be made.gt Second GTA V and GTA IV are in the same universeYeah just like RDR  will be. That doesnt mean the stories have to be linked. GTA games have completely separate stories whether theyre titled numerically or otherwise. Theres no reason to believe this will be different in their other franchise.gt IV and SA also have some of these links but way less than V and IV.I just dont think this is really true at all. Theyre all in the same universe and in the same country within that universe. They take place in different cities but of course there are little easter eggs and crossovers between them. I mean why would events that happened or car names be different? That would make no sense.I think the point remains obvious that given the example of Rockstars other games being titled as RDR does not suggest the story will be linked to the original in any significant way beyond references. It could turn out to be a direct sequel but theres currently no reason to suspect that given the evidence we have available which is the precedent from this company.,reddeadredemption,d8xak8b,5,t5_2rn7o

Either there going to use the  or more character concept from GTAV or well play this dude in the middle. I dont think Marston would be the hero in this game if it was a one playable character thing.

The Pro is identical to the standard PS in terms of RAM and will exclusively come with a TB hard drive whereas the PS had a GB option. When it comes to performance to streaming services such as Netflix it supports K as opposed to the standard PSs p resolution. However on games its a tricky one. Games are slightly more complicated because it will be up to developers to decide how they want to use the PS Pros extra muscle. So its up to Rockstar on how different it will look. We can say for sure now though that Red Dead Redemption will run better and most likely look better.,reddeadredemption,d93n8tq,2,t5_2rn7o

This could be troubling with underage players. I think that is why they didnt implement the stock market either. They do allow you bet on competitions though. The maximum bet though is k. For a  shark card that is about  cents. Im hoping they can find a way around this. Maybe having some other currency like animal furs that you cant buy with real money.
