That is its best to speak your mind because even if youre wrong you can at least correct yourself whereas saying nothing at all is just meaningless. Which is why the song is pretty ruthless with all the shit Lupe brings up in that track.My favourite though and this is my alltime favourite song is They Resurrect Over New. The idea of bettering yourself and proceeding to the next level of enlightenment is basically guiding my life right now after hitting rock bottom. Managed to put a decent plan for myself into place and get motivated to follow through and this track has been integral to this phase. And AbSouls verse at the end is so fucking dope being more than a stoner having an interest in the Universe expanding knowledge outside of a claustrophobic school system. I can relate.,LupeFiasco,d5votne,6,t5_2spyg
