If you upgraded the phone without doing a factory reset then changes in the system partition of logs referring to root access may still be around. I would have downloaded a root checker to make sure you no longer had root access. Also if you did not wipe the internal storage there could be traces of the superuser in the dataapps or folders made by other apps that require superuser access. In the future the best method would be to reflash the ROM in recovery mode essentially making it a clean slate.,lgg2,chhmz4o,1,t5_2y2tt

Devs have gotten it to the point where most AOSP Kit Kat roms dont crash  times a day but they will always be buggy and have romspecific quirks. Troubleshooting them is always going to be tough.If you really want fully open source software AOSP may be worth it even with the quirks. If you want a stable experience then stock or stockbased roms are the only real option. Personally Id prefer to have AOSP and as much as I love this phone there are times I wish I had gone with the Nexus . That said some of the stockbased roms can be a pretty comfortable experience.,lgg2,cije4d3,2,t5_2y2tt

Even wipes the sd card.Im staying stock and unrooted for a while in order to catch the next OTA Lollipop? then I might root again. But if I can live without root I will.

7758179,0,t3_4liwst,Yeah I have the same problem.  I dont know what kind of car your mom has but I have a VW GTI.  I have found that I can only get voice navigation two ways and both have their drawbacks..  Connect phone via Bluetooth and choose Bluetooth audio as my music source.  Navigation voice then plays through the car speakers. The problem is I can only get music by streaming from my phone.  If I choose another audio source navigation voice is muted..  Do not connect phone to car via Bluetooth.  The navigation will then speak from the phone and you can choose any music source.  But then you loose Bluetooth phone options in your car.It sucks but I havent found any other solutions.,lgg2,d3o1nji,2,t5_2y2tt
