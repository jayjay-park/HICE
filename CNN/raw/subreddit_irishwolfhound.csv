10975500,0,t1_debujqj,Thank you. Your Maggie reminds me so much of our Maggie. Ours was a dark brindle but she lightened up quite a bit. She still has some brown but shes a lot more gray than we expected. Your Maggie is adorably cute and she has that puppy fur!  Cant get enough of wolfhounds! ,irishwolfhound,dec2l8m,2,t5_2xnsg
