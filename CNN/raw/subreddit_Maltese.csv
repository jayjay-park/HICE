I use one hand to hold his eye shut and us the other and apply it with my finger so I have the most control possible.  I make a thick paste so it doesnt really move after applied as it goes on pretty dry. I have never had a problem but like I said I am super careful. Also I rarely have to do this he stays pretty white from regular baths and washing. I also buy this one eye wash at Tractor Supply that works great for regular cleaning on his face so the only time I have to deal with stains are when he plays super hard with another dog or gets treats that arent grain free then I will see some red staining occasionally.,Maltese,cx1oei0,2,t5_2qlmf
