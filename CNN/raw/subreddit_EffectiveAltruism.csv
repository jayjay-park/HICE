8318146,0,t3_4tdjmv,In my perception people are generally poor at predicting their satisfaction with various career paths and also tend to underestimate the degree of flexibility they will have within a certain career path to find interesting work which is suited to them. If you dont like working long hours you can get a  doing risk management at a commercial bank. If you dont like work thats disconnected from helping people you can manage a pension fund or work in healthcare private equity. Etc etc.gtbut thats likely to be a difficult career pathDepends on what you do... becoming an actuary is a much different process from becoming a quant. And both of those careers are quite pleasant compared to say investment banking.gtone that will surely make me suffer Why do you think so?gtand have negative affects on my healthFor a few jobs sure. But like I said it depends on what you do. gtI can also try to follow my dreams and be a biostatiscianWhat makes you sure you would enjoy being a biostatistician?gtThere is a pressing moral impulse for me to earn to give Maybe. What are you looking to accomplish? You can go into nonprofit grantmaking or government science budgets and have control over x as much money as you would working in finance. If you want to get rid of poverty then you can work for a foundation and direct grants to effective programs. If you want to advance biotechnology or reduce wild animal suffering then you can get a PhD and manage government programs and policy.,EffectiveAltruism,d5hbowj,2,t5_2v2e5
9398497,0,t1_d97akom,You stated production animals live overall happy lives but mention in your reply that humans are assumed to live happy lives.  I am not following.  I was asking how farm animals factory farms if we want to be even more particular live happy lives?Why not animals?  Because we are not obligate carnivores and a large portion if not the majority of people in first world countries have readily access to the necessary food supplements and information to subsist healthily on a vegetarian or vegan diet.  Reducing animal suffering environmental harm and human suffering all by avoiding animal products sounds utilitarian to me.,EffectiveAltruism,d97bq68,1,t5_2v2e5
9775547,0,t1_dahiwhf,gt What I am trying to ask is if an anonymous benefactor gifts you  on the condition that you donate it as you see fit how would you allocate it between animal and human suffering? Personally I would only feel right about going  human. What am I missing?Its okay to give  to just one cause in fact thats probably the rational thing to do as long as youre not getting into much larger amounts of money. If you think that human charities would accomplish more with that money than animal charities then you give  to them if you disagree then you should give all of it to animal charities.,EffectiveAltruism,dai1w12,3,t5_2v2e5

10517390,0,t1_dczzfo0,I am generally on board with the idea of partisan politics in EA but it would have to be donewell to high epistemic standards instead of this kind of soft acceptance of generic progressivism. And it should be discussed explicitly instead of being smuggling in. For this reason the taboo against politics is sort of problematic because it encourages the latter over the former. Otherwise k would be able to defend itself and have sufficient disclaimers against this kind of response.But given the costs in time and effort of doing political analysis well it may not be worth it overall.Also k is pretty outwardfacing. So that may have influenced the decision to include those organizations.,EffectiveAltruism,dd09ch9,3,t5_2v2e5
10925072,0,t1_de6m7om,Farm animal welfare seems to be a cause that is most constrained by funding as well as movement building. In that case you have to ask yourself whether youd be more successful in investment banking and related careers quantitative finance or tech. Find some reputable test for measuring how extroverted you are try asking raskpsychology or just introspect. If youre an assertive and social person then you might want to do investment banking or something very similar and you should consider that a reason in favor of going to a prestigious school. Its also a career where majoring in math or CS would not be quite as good as majoring in economics. Even if youre not so social but still polished and professional if youre good at math or CS then youre likely to be well suited for quantitative finance and you can go to graduate school for math or finance before working meaning that going to a prestigious school for undergrad is not so important though some quants go straight into the workforce after undergrad in which case your choice of undergrad would matter. Finally software engineeringprogramming is the third big option in earning to give but I simply dont know enough about the field to make recommendations. Some other places you should ask for advicerquantrfinancecareerswww.wallstreetoasis.comEA groups on FacebookAnd of course there is all kinds of content on But I think that when it comes to far future stuff the generally best thing to do is to get a hard science PhD. Thats a pretty subjective assessment on my part but some EAs with highly relevant experience agree. There are good opportunities to get involved with public funding and institutions. Making MM annually on Wall St. is probably within your reach but being in charge of a MM research budget for government programs is equally tenable. Everybody wants to make money for themselves but not many people want to control budget priorities in government and academia. You cant put money wherever you like but you can have surprising leeway select projects that are still worthwhile and advise top politicians and organizations. Being a researcher in mainstream society entails a lot more than simply doing research there are important peripheral aspects of the job that ordinary people dont think or talk about very much. You can go to the Elon Musks and Peter Thiels of the world and tell them where they should put their money note you dont need to be a scientist to do this its only one method. And if you want you still have the ability to switch gears and do quant finance or research with EA organizations which I think is highly valuable just low in career capitalreputation. Anyway if you do this then the name brand of your undergraduate university doesnt matter very much arguably it doesnt matter at all. However you may be active with student EA groups. I think this gives a good reason to go to a highly selective university if you can do work which gets new people involved in EA then youll want to do it at as elite a university as you can since those students will tend to be more successful and wealthier. Im not sure how strong of a reason this is to go to an elite school because I dont know exactly how successful movement building on campus is.gtIm not all that intelligent compared to Ivy students so I probably wouldnt even be accepted to toptier universities. I dont really have any interesting extracurriculars either. My GPA is near perfect.Universities dont know how intelligent you are and theres probably lots of Ivy League students much dumber than you are. If you have a nearperfect GPA then you should probably apply to a number of them just in case. A  fee and five hours of your time for an application is worth it even if the chance is extremely small.Are you in the US? Are you a junior right now? If so you have a lot of time to find some. If youre a senior wouldnt applications be due already? maybe you can sign up for kickboxing or something this weekend. Hope that helps.,EffectiveAltruism,de6uff9,2,t5_2v2e5

11181925,0,t1_dezfop9,gt They say no to that in a bunch of different ways e.g. the importance of cooperation the probability that uncontrolled AI will cause more suffering than controlled AI.I am aware of those arguments. But as someone on the EA forum said they only support cooperation to prevent other groups from opposing them not because they intrinsically value it. As for the probability that uncontrolled AI will cause more suffering than controlled AI what if they change their minds and decide paperclips are better than humancontrolled values? Then would you be concerned?gt Also they dont support the euthanasia of all sentient life at least not as an organization probably a subset of them would support it in an abstract sense.They openly support the premises leading up to that conclusion sufferingfocused ethics torturelevel suffering cannot be counterbalanced. It doesnt take a genius to see that .gt Opinionpolicing is very dangerous in a movement which is all about reason.Presumably you believe that at least some opinions should not be tolerated.
