They got no Repo got to find the guys they are on Twitter. They went invisible last year I dont think they wanna do it anymore.However this issue seems to be related to Siri not working Weather app Mail and Safari not loading.It is alll the same fix. Remove afcadd . Remove Appsync. Install iFile in case you dont have it. Navigate to varmobileLibraryCaches. Locate com.apple.mobile.installation.plist and delete the file . Locate com.apple.LaunchServices.csstore and delete the file . Reboot your device. Install Appsync again.. ENJOY!ImportantTry to avoid installing afcadd for a while !!!,jailbreak,ceejpqc,2,t5_2r8c5

87304,0,t1_ceoct1e,Oh you dug through my post history. Spooky. Dig harder and youll note that Im also Apple certified MaciPhone technician and that electrical engineering major you pointed out there emphasizes on robotics and battery systems so I think I know a few things about what Im talking about. The M coprocessor isnt as you seem to think just another processor because its designed very specifically from the transistors up to do one specific thing interpret and record data coming off of the accelerometers and the GPS. Why is this different from the A? The M saves energy overall by allowing the A to cycle down while the phone still remains aware of its location and movement. Its not capable of running processes that dont pertain to location tracking. So if youre saying its just another processor then you dont know what it does or what it can do. But since were on the subject of explaining things can you explain what meant before when you said my tweak partially disable what the m was originally intended for Because and I dont mean to be rude in saying this but I dont understand what you mean or how you would do it with a relatively simple substrate tweak. And doing whatever youre talking about with my phone an iPhone  isnt going to help prove your point here. Ill prove youre wrong another wayThe iPod touch has a . Watthour battery This is only twothirds of the capacity of the s battery but Ill cover that. The iPod touch is essentially an iPhone with a slower less powerhungry chip and no cellular radio. With its . Wh battery it can achieve  hours of video playback with wifi on. So we can assume that in the case of the s with only wifi on it could reach  hours of video playback. Video playback is EDIT there should be a NOT here. This is what I get for redditing at  am a very processor intensive task since all modern processors have H. decoding in their hardware and Wifi does not use very much power especially when associated with a network. So in airplane mode we can assume that your iPhone can reach maybe  hours of very mild screenon usage. Somehow though youre claiming to be able to double that with your tweak with the cellular radio running all the time and other radios running as needed including gaming and web browsing. So forgive me if I seem skeptical of your tweak because I know Apple hardware and battery technology in general backwards and forwards and I do not believe for one second that your tweak can do what you claim. Sure maybe it can improve battery life I have no problem believing that. But you are seriously saying you can make a phone last a week with a few simple adjustments? Wrong. Edit Also could you explain how your tweak manages to shut off the bluetooth radio while still having the ability you described here  Says that there will be an allow list for certain things so you can still use your Pebble smart watch for example. The Pebble watch does twoway communication with the iPhone i.e. pushing buttons on the Pebble does stuff on the phone. If the phones bluetooth radio is off there will be no way the phone knows the Pebble is trying to talk to it.,jailbreak,ceoda04,9,t5_2r8c5

191315,0,t3_1w9ihl,I like not having to maintain an external project anymore. What I hate is when Apple does it poorly and then I have to first undo what they did in the process of still maintaining my replacement. Apple no... you fundamentally misunderstand the value of having pictures of people in the address book... if you cut a circle around the persons head youve destroyed the valuable contextual surrounding that helps you recognize that person at a glance. It also just looks stupid peoples heads arent circular so when you cut a circle it just looks sloppy unless you go to extreme lengths to balance the shot which is almost impossible to do using your photo editor. You simply never see a circular portrait in the wild the closest common equivalent are actually ovals. Meanwhile when was the last time you even saw an oval portrait on someones wall? When you see one of those round portraits do you feel like you are in the future or the past? Round photographs are a style that looks downright Victorian because it seems to have been a shortlived fad during the th and early th centuries that mankind grew out of... and no the fact that G has circular profile pictures does not make it a good idea in fact G doing something generally means it is a bad idea. Maybe instead of trying and failing to implement CyntactI mean the way you did it isnt even efficient and is only usable at all because the Favorites list tends to be short and hardware is now usually fastyou could have done an amazing replacement for Cyueue so I could put that one behind me P. lt this is a good demonstration of my emotional state when I see that Apple sortofbutnotquite implemented one of my extensions.,jailbreak,cf08b8d,39,t5_2r8c5

It not like I only have  tweaks installed either I have tweaked the shit out of my device and it runs fine. Your phone obviously wont run iOS  as well as an iPhone s but it probably doesnt run iOS  flawlessly anymore.Coming from an iPhone  user Id say upgrade and rejailbreak especially if you cant use apps you want to.

248735,0,t3_1wwaw0,Ive found the solution!!!!Step . Go to the app you want in the AppStore and buydownload it.Step . You are going to get the error so click ok then when you look at the install area on the app page there will be a blue spinning wheel click it.Step . The wheel should fade and stop if it does not then click the home button and reopen it until the wheel is faded and not moving.Step . Click the home button and close the AppStore out of the multitasking menu and then reopen the AppStore.Step . There should be a could where install used to be click it and the app will download no problem!Hope this helps!,jailbreak,cf6ja2u,0,t5_2r8c5

It isnt a perfect solution but if you keep your files in Dropbox it works pretty smoothly. Edit I also used to use AnyAttach Cydia but it doesnt look to be updated for ios.

The only things Id like to see would maybe be some blurstransparencies or possibly even some gradients to offset some of the darknesssimilar to some of the apple apps like Facetime and I think trailers. Sometimes the dark on dark on dark can be a bit jarring but with todays update almost all of my issues with the tweak were fixed.  Also I saw iPad support was added today which really compliments my day old purchase of an iPad Mini Retina. Keep up the good work and communication even though its been a rocky relationship Eclipse remains one of my favorite tweaks. I even fresh restored my phone today because I had way to many packages and tweaks piling up since the release of Evasion and Eclipse made its way into my minimal tweak download list. ,jailbreak,cfhanzo,3,t5_2r8c5

Ive emailed back and forth with him for a few years now pretty regularly and if anything Ive learned that he knows best. Im not insulting his skill or anything frankly hes one of the best devs out there if not the best however why would this design be better? Because it doesnt restrict your finger to the left half of the screen to use the passcode. this way I could easily tap right sidetop with my right or left side top with my left without a prejudice on the buttons part. Apple saw this Im sure. Petrich just doesnt like it either because its more compact or hes left handed or who knows.

421929,0,t3_1yvnsr,I appreciate some of the passionate slash frustrated comments in here. p The only real cases of delay have been with AltKeyboard  and Anemo the latter I have explained in a reply to theCarryAll.AltKeyboard  is looking good and on track for some time next month but understand that the keyboard has changed drastically in iOS  and even . which has made the tweak more difficult than a simple port its being written from scratch. On top of this the developer has had exams and such which hasnt made things move faster as he originally intended. I believe itll go beyond your expectations. The trouble with ETAs is the developer can only do so much to estimate when something will be done and I can only do so much to not respond to people demanding ETAs to updates. Quite a pickle!In any case the only thing that matters at the end of the day is that some awesome stuff is in the pipes and I cant wait more than any of you guys.

All the apps which are invoked via those two tweaks could easily have been implemented into one row with numerous pages via QuickActivator  even other Activator gestures. You can add as many glyphs as you so desire if need be. EDIT On second view even the third row couldve been taken care of with activator. Indeed functionality is quite desirable. But at this great a cost to aesthetics? Not my cup of tea.

871188,0,t1_ch36ovs,Corsair Voyager Air or seagate wireless plus  custom firmware is the best way to do that. Or there might be ways to plug your current external hard drive into a similar wifi hotspot device  but I think when I researched that you end up with conflicts with file format issues something like only FAT being allowed....By the time you have faffed around with iFile unpowered usb hubs and made sure your battery is  you cant charge a lightning device with a usbsd adapter plugged in. You will be better off with the wifi hard drive alternatives. I dont really see a reason not to use them in this situation except for maybe the initial startup cost but they have come down in price now. Or maybe you need more than tb storage? Though I know it is possible to put at least put tb in the seagate if your desperate and have the  to spend on it lol. ,jailbreak,ch3b3zi,1,t5_2r8c5

But you use touch id to unlock but if you fail  times then there should be a passcode page asking you to type in the pinThat way youll never get locked out on your phone as long as you fail three times the pin page should come upBut the device recognizes your fongersNow i agree on still keeping after boot pr turning on pr waiting a few days and passcodes is being asked for ONCE,jailbreak,chc0cvb,1,t5_2r8c5

I would venture a guess that those were not very lucrative endeavors or an ios compatible version would be available by now. One of the problems is content where are you going to get decent video choices to pick from. The groups that tried to give solutions for this probably used up their resources as it is a costly proposal to host or distribute preproduced video ringtone clips. If this isnt a moneyearning idea it probably doesnt stand much chance of becoming supported by a player with the resources to execute the idea faithfully. Just adding a video playback to phone call reception isnt going to satisfy users who are left there wondering where to get video clips from.

That being said a quick question. As I understand it and I could be wrong obviously thats why I ask the Kernel level of the OS dictates how the software specifically interacts with the hardware of the device so If one were to say attempt a CPU overclock by making changes in the Kernel and fried their processor this would qualify as bricking wouild it not?

And after thinking it through it wasnt from idownloadblog it was an email that I received from appgratis where the image was at the top of the email.  So I held down the image pressed copy and then pasted into Safari. I downloaded the image and when I opened it I saw that Verizon ad thats overlaying the wallpaper. Said what the f? Closed it then opened it again. The correct image appeared this time. So I saved it to the camera roll and set it as wallpaper. When I went to the home screen the image and the ad overlay were there. Anyway I erased the image from camera erased the download in ifile ran icleaner resprung set a new wallpaper and it was fine for a little while.

Is this how its meant to be? And if yes why? Could you make it so Im allowed to interact with elements of the UI on screen WHILE the hud is present on screen?

Apple are doing what they can but tiny issues like this still get through because its not  machine its a team of humans that make mistakes. Oh and lets not forget ios was a major rework so consider it being back to square one for Apple.Criticism is one thing but shit talking a company is where you come off as a prick.

1317801,1,t1_cihtcdc,Ive had a look at JellyLockClock and Im afraid I have no clue whats going on. As far as I can tell CustomCover should have no effect on what JellyLockClock is doing. The only possible explanation I can think of is that CustomCover is messing up the view hierarchy which would mean that if JellyLockClock uses a dodgy method to determine where to add the views it will break. Theres nothing I can do to fix this if it is the case though it seems unlikely. Other than that I have no clue  Im also getting zerozero as the time sometimes? I would recommend contacting the JellyLockClock dev about it to see what he has to say and if he can easily fix anything on his end.As for reminderscalendar Im afraid Im not going to buy tweaks which I dont intend to use solely for compatibility testing though from the screenshots Im not sure what the problem is. Surely the calendar eventsreminders hidden when the artwork is shown otherwise why have CustomCover at all? Otherwise it should appear as notifications do with a dark overlay behind making them legible. If they are shown without a dark overlay behind there is not much I can do  its very difficult to modify other tweaks  it would be easier to have eventsreminders displayed in the same way as notifications with a dark overlay which is down to the dev of that tweak.Sorry I couldnt be of more help but intertweak compatibility is generally very difficult. Any more details may help though at the minute Im pretty stumped. As I said contact the other devs and see if they can do anything to rectify the issues.,jailbreak,cihvb9p,-2,t5_2r8c5

Saurik started all of this by creating cydia and has continuously updated it making It immensely better over the years despite being fucked over by the evadrs. He doesnt JUST do cydia either. Hes always had TONS of other projects and such. With all of this Im not saying this is bad. On Android I have  app stores on my rooted device for contingency and different feature sets. I see this as the same thing. I hope to see this completed. How will we get it though?

Ive had a lot less issues than most people on this subreddit amp Ive found one common denominator. I never ever restore from a backup. My phone is ALWAYS setup as a new phone prior to a new JB. Many times I see people having issues with apps on the same phone that seems to be fixed by starting fresh. Thats just a few examples that can be deep dived into to find a myriad of underlying causes. This can be extremely difficult even for a technical user amp now you want to add an average user into the fray? I just think youre asking for trouble.

1482474,0,t1_cj235qg,Hmm.. Well when putting in my SIM card Verizon it did ask me what carrier to link it to and stating that once I choose I could NOT change it again however the only options I saw were Verizon and a bunch of other carriers that Ive never heard of. He did put in an ATampT SIM card in my iPhone  because apparently one of the steps required a SIM card and the customer support told me the night before to take my SIM card out before I brought it in. I doubt it couldve worked with ATampT specifically because my phone is CDMA whereas ATampT is GSM but he only used the SIM card temporarily to complete a step. So if it could  work with another carrier I dont know. Although if I recall correctly from an article I saw on reddit its legal to unlock your phone now.Now condition wise my loaner phone looked brand new but it was refurbished. Not as good as mine to be honest because my phone has had a case on since day  currently in a giant Otterbox Armor case and before that a Defender case that is until I brought it in for them to fix it he actually complimented my phone saying its one of the few phones he seen in nearperfect condition lol. But keep in mind that these phones are all refurbished  GB loaner phones. So theyre not new and each phone will vary. Ive heard of some people getting refurbished loaners that were absolutely in atrocious conditions with scratches dents etc. and heard of some people getting refurbished loaners that they thought were actually brand new iPhones. I was lucky to get a one in good condition but you wont know what you get until you see it.tldr Unlocked looked like it. never dealt with the whole unlocking thing before. Good condition?

1509064,0,t3_2bdryg,A few small thingsI would like to be able to inside vestigo.  Select which hotspots are connected to automatically. Autojoin OnOff This would be helpful instead of having to use the iPhone config utility  Have the option to check onoff auto connection to all open hotspots. pin and double confirm required to turn on This would be extremely helpful for my campus wifi thats spread out over many different access points with different names.  Be able to configure the proxy options and turn them onoff from vestigo.,jailbreak,cj5fq5p,1,t5_2r8c5

I just didnt agree with your statement that People jailbreak so they can pirate and steal. That isnt why ALL people in the community jailbreak and this was never about me.I bought a tweak yesterday without any issues what are you talking about when you say he isnt allowing his own store to sell tweaks? Easy access to pirate repos? If he happened to do what you are suggesting and block the known pirate repos there would be new urls popping up the next day so thats not gonna do anything. Not to mention that restricting a jailbreak would be pointless. Tongbu came up after a quick google search. Thanks for calling me a hardcore pirate though. Also  pirates? Where did you get that figure? Not sure why you need to take personal jabs to make a point. Facts usually work a lot better...Your entire argument is invalided and has no credibility coming from someone like you.Ive never heard of Tongbu prior to you mentioning it probably because Im not as hardcore as you in pirating.

1622248,0,t1_cjjm77m,Agreed. Its pretty shady. I think not justifying it in any way some people still see the whole act of jailbreaking in any form a little bit below board or like its only something hackerscriminals do and therefore are wary of giving money or credit card details to anybody who actively engages in this field when in actuality as you will be able to attest to the jailbreaking developer scene is just like any other appsoftware development scene and developers have a right to charge for and do charge for their software. This could explain why people dont wanna take a chance at paying for an app that they can illegally procure for free even if the price is a negligible amount e.g.   dollars etc. Also the type of people who still see jailbreaking as an illegal activity are also probably more likely to be of the mindset that theyve already done something wronglegal by jailbreaking so why not go one step further and obtain their jailbreak tweaks etc by illegal means as well. Does that make sense? I agree that its a problem. I think more work needs to be done in getting the message out there that opening up your personal mobile devices to these sort of thirdparty software applications is in no way bad or illegal and hope that this encourages people to treat these apps like any other paid appstore purchases although Im assuming if youre clever enough to know how to illegally download cydia tweaks then youre probably also clever enough to know how to download paid apps for free as well...!,jailbreak,cjjneqy,2,t5_2r8c5

A lot of them still work fine but I see them detecting my jailbreak by just scanning the filesystem for things like cydia and sshd. Personally. I think its bullshit I dont think any app I get from the AppStore should be allowed to be poking through my filesystem without my permission but apple is going to take the side of lucrative app developers over jail breakers....,jailbreak,cjsns00,14,t5_2r8c5

Given an example like if you recorded a call with Tom it says the phone call was with James. This makes it confusing to keep the recording organized when it shows the wrong name of the recording. This seem to happen too often.Another annoying issue is when recording during a Viber call it only records the other person not yourself.Besides these two issues its a great call recorder. ,jailbreak,cjz1xt1,5,t5_2r8c5
1744754,0,t1_cjz2rjp,The reason it is called a tweak is because they are snippets of code that tweaks the system i.e. does some modification. Apps generally dont do that.

I think it may have been triggered by stress and anxiety but even when Im relaxed I cant naturally sleep. I can tell you now that Ive been treated for it and am getting medicine that helps my brain switch off that Im feeling a lot better more confident and recognizing the longterm damage that insomnia has done to me. I saw sleep in almost the same way  more resentful of the fact that I couldnt sleep  but I decided it was wasteful and I could do so much more and that if there was a pill that could make you refreshed without needing the sleep I would totally take it now I kind of love sleeping. If you can I recommend trying to get on a normal peoples schedule. It seems lame and I dont even completely agree with my own advice but I still recommend it.

1810220,0,t1_ck7am1i,You can choose banks that fuck people over much less though.  For instance local regional banks and credit unions are great options.  Particularly credit unions as they have yearly member meetings where anyone with a bank account has the right to speak on how the bank is being ran.  The banks you should avoid are the too big to fail corporate monsters who dont give two shits about the  you have in your account because they lose that much in a fraction of a second hundreds of times a day via microtransactions.  The banks that help companies like Enron screw hundreds of employees out of pensions and retirement plans they have worked their entire lives for.  The banks that sold thousands of junk loans to investment companies costing people retirement savings.  The banks that foreclosed on people homes when they didnt even hold the mortgages.  You can easily avoid those banks and still function in a western society.  I have done it my entire adult life.  ,jailbreak,ck7b1e2,4,t5_2r8c5

Its monopolization that the jailbreaking community ends up compromising and thats a good thing for developers and consumers alike.Personally Ive put up with apples monopolization in mobile because of how significant their innovations have been.

2087801,0,t1_cl56kdh,A little demeaning but expected on the internet especially from people who are so selfrighteous.We arent talking about the newest and best. iOS  has been out for a year.  Get real. Half the apps I use on a daily basis need iOS . Im not comfortable with many of the bugs and security issues in older apps I could get from my iTunes backups for an older iOS. No thanks.So you didnt like the look and feel of iOS  and yet you are ready to update to iOS ?  Its basically the same UI.  Make up your mind. Whatever conscious decision you made to stay on iOS  I believe was foolish. Its yours so run with it. Initially iOS  was a nightmare on ip. It got better with each update. And people stopped complaining about it. If there were going to be complaints they would be on here. Your reasoning has its flaws. I guess I should take out my mac and rollBack to snow leopard because its a little speedier and the directory structure and hidden files are easier to find. I honestly dont care what firmware youre on. I only care that you come off selfrighteous and like a prick. If youre as as well informed as you pretend to be you should have already known you cant restore to your current iOS.And in case youre wondering why no one answered you before me its because its in the the side bar. Did you read it?  Usually the vocal slamming people get from asking idiot questions like yours are way worse than me telling you it was silly to not update. Im done with you troll. ,jailbreak,cl57ex8,5,t5_2r8c5

2180792,0,t3_2k12ah,Nice write up but I really think that at this point if people need such an indepth explanation then they probably shouldnt be jailbreaking right now anyways. Substrate has not been updated so almost all tweaks will not work and apparently enabling your passcode after opening Cydia can make you have to restore. At this point it is really only useful for developers who are trying to make their tweaks iOS  compatible so having the average enduser jailbreak right now is not a good idea in my opinion. Best to wait for these issues to be fixed then you wont have to do any of this hacky stuff to get it working anyways. ,jailbreak,clh157h,-1,t5_2r8c5

2183482,0,t1_clh231p,TLDR with the manpower Pangu has it isnt worth it for the Evadrs to try to beat them to a jailbreak. They get a rush and a sense of accomplishment. Pangu gets the dough.There isnt going to be an evasin jailbreak for iOS .X. The guys seem to be moving on to bigger and better things. The difference Pangu are paid they will almost certainly make a lot of money off this. The Evadrs dodid it for fun in their spare time most have real jobs.Here is another reason why this jailbreak came out so fast. Pangu have I would guess quite a few people who were working as many hours as humanly possible every day towards a JB. Say it takes  combined hours to make a jailbreakrandom number Im not claiming thats how long it takes with all the research testing etc.Lets say each member of Pangu works a full  hour day towards the jailbreak.I believe there are  members that means they are collectively able to achieve the  hours required in a mere  days.The Evadrs most of whom I believe have full time jobs can only allocate lets say  hours each per day toward the jailbreakthis seems like a very optimistic number to me partially why I believe the other jailbreaks by the Evadrs have taken so long to come out. In the same  days the evaders have only collectively been able to researchtest half of the  hours. Add in other things that they do in their lives that timeline becomes very elongated.I personally believe that the ship for the Evadrs has sailed in the jailbreak world. I dont know how they could even begin to compete with a force like Pangu. I mean unless they all decided to quit their jobs and pursue the jailbreak as their job they would need some major financial backing to even make it worth it I dont think they will be coming back into the game.I hope that the Evadrs find joy in whatever they move on to Im still crossing my fingers that psixninja will be the first to dump the bootloader on one of the new devices. Thatd mean a guaranteed jailbreak on that device on any Firmware the last Device I believe this was achieved on was the iPhone? Maybe the gs. But an exploit of this magnitude is the only way I see the Evadrs making a comeback. I feel it would be the only thing worth their time. Why slave away wasting your precious spare time when you know someone else is doing it for their job. And we know by now that the Pangu team is pretty much here to stay and that they are good!EDIT spellinggrammar,jailbreak,clhdgkm,1,t5_2r8c5

I have applocker ifile iclearner pro  activator bloard swipeselection noslowanimation and zeppelin installed.

It could have been then or it couldve been any other time you might have entered the card details online for instance you might have used your desktop PC to set up the card with your Amazon account. You couldve had a virus on your PC that was key logging your card info.Since Cydia does not directly deal with your card it cant have been Cydia as everybody else has said.

But the phone doesnt recognise that theres no internet connection so it sticks with the wifi instead of falling back on cellular. It gets pretty annoying when your default wifi is unreliable like that college wifi and too often you go about thinking youre connected because you see the wifi icon but it turns out youre not and you have to switch off wifi to use G. In the iOS betas since iOS  or  there was cellular fallback which recognised when the wifi didnt actually reach the Internet and would automatically fallback to cellular without user prompt which was sweet but apple kept removing that from the iOS   and  betas.,jailbreak,cmdgo1n,1,t5_2r8c5

Or are you confident enough in the quality of your work and figure well Ive already come this far why the hell should I throw it away. Competition is sometimes essential since it results in a superior product eventually. Im all for it. If this long time Dev didnt release this who knows if SpiritofLogic would have continued to even update this tweak since it would be the only one of its kind with no competition.

2481337,0,t3_2nzljs,. I jailbreak so I can customize my phone however I want and give it a unique standing among all of the other iDevices. Honestly the community is better both user and developer. Android in my opinion is too decentralized. The jailbreak community is decentralized as well but we are still united through Cydia. On a hardware note iPhones are more polished and beautifullydesigned. Apples iPhones manage to beat CPUs several times as strong from a specs perspective dualcore . GHz vs. quad core . GHz CPU? iPhone ftw.. The support and interaction between different members of different tiers we can talk to certain developers and hackers in the community. It would be hard to talk to Tim Cook directly but it wouldnt be as hard contacting someone like Ryan Petrich or saurik himself. . At times the community can be a bit... harsh. On certain topics and users. Because the majority of us are not exactly experts in the field ourselves we tend to jump on a bandwagon whenever someone posts news in the sub or a dev announces news.

It overridesinserts functionality into something that already exists the purpose of Substrate is to blend thirdparty code into and over firstparty code. Sizeable tweaks like IntelliscreenX may be able to implement rough method invocation algorithms in an attempt to calculate a guestimate of time spent eating CPU cycles but without a process to track youre largely still just comparing PreTweak numbers to PostTweak numbers. The effects of a tweak are largely indistinguishable and impossible to monitor unless they have obvious leaks or are particularly heavy on the processor again through their stock host process.edit I dont know how itd be technically possible for Substrate to calculate the effects of a tweak outside of keeping track of each time the tweak does something.

In the case of tweaks its a check to see if youve paid for the tweak. gtIs it bad? is it good?Its not inherently good or bad. Its good in the sense that its a way for developers to make sure only people who are paying for their work have access to it. That will work to encourage them to keep developing good content while knowing theyll be paid properly for their hard work. The downside is that its not always implemented well and can have a negative effect on the end user. Usually its no more than slight annoyance in the case of tweaks other mediums have more obtrusive methods of DRM. gthow can I tell if any of my tweaks have it?For the most part there is no sure fire way.

2579693,0,t1_cmvab6s,This is more of a myth even just thinking about it. Of course the only thing I can understand is if you get an official tweak from official repo you know theres nothing malicious for a fact even then you cant be certain but thats getting into malicious things. Pirated tweaks in their own nature arent always worse in performance than their official counterparts. If you get something from a sketchy repo yes theres a good chance or possibility it had other stuff in it or maybe someone felt like being a dick and edited something. But for the most part pirate repos or more known ones just have someone download the package then copy it and re upload to their repo without charge. I dont support pirating Im all for supporting the devs. But I dont believe pirated tweaks themselves are any different from official ones other than slower updates and if gotten from an unknown repo or sketchy place then yes they may be different. ,jailbreak,cmvaxso,2,t5_2r8c5

It can easily be disabled in settings and you can still receive other iphone users read receipts.It looks like OP wanted the read receipt to wait to send until he started typing but is there a tweak out there that keeps messages unread on my device until I respond or manually mark them as read? not referring to read receipts just blue dotapp badge,jailbreak,cn0r54k,2,t5_2r8c5

2623259,0,t3_2pxw09, Before we start this is not my first time jail breaking and sorry for the wall of text but I would like some help. Ive been testing all day trying to figure out why my MMS hasnt been stuck at downloading since last week when I upgraded from . to .. and jail broke again. At first I was puzzled but really just let it slide  but then today Ive been  trying to find the culprit. st I started off by uninstalling all of my tweaks that deal with the messages app. And asked friends and to send me pictures over and over again as seen in the screenshot But that didnt work.  So next nd I tried turning iMessage off  and on SEVERAL times. Still didnt work . rd I didnt know what other tweaks could cause issues so I uninstalled all of them and the problem still persisted. Soth  I eventually RESTORED and tested  pics went through clean.I then reinstalled the tweak I thought was the culprit I thought it was type read so I did that and i also had to install BourneAgainSHell so I got friends to send another picture and there the problem was again.  th I restored my phone again. Then Installed the BourneAgainSHell cause you have to and no other tweaks and requested a pic to be sent and guess what It didnt work again!  So Ive concluded that its either BASH or the taig jailbreak itself. ,jailbreak,cn0zwtu,0,t5_2r8c5

If it isnt please disregard the rest of this message and contact the moderators to get your post approved.Cydia screenshots arent very informative when it comes to release posts because it usually tells people nothing other than the name of the tweak and repo it is hosted on. It doesnt give us any screenshots description about the tweak or its price and thus doesnt help people decide if it is a tweak they would find useful. Youre welcome to repost this but please follow these two steps first. Check to see if somebody else hasnt already posted it. If they have then theres no need for you to post it.. Check out our wiki page on making good posts. Post a link to the Cydia depiction a link to the package a tweet made by the developer or an article or YouTube video about the tweakThanks for understanding!I am a botrAutoModeratorcommentsqpuwhatisautomoderator and this action was performed automatically.

Also before one goes oh man you should wait to buy tweaks or its so cheap thats not really the point then there needs to be some kind of QA to be expected.

I have gotten reports of this issue but thats not since the last updates it is unrelated.

For example on my iPhone  it runs fine in the background because it has lots of RAM.I literally get up to  emails a day and there is just no way I can answer all of those especially if people then answer back and so on.

From experience youre always likely to run into issuesconflictscrashes and it makes it much more difficult to pinpoint the culprit.You could always use iCleaner Pro to disable all of your tweaks and begin to reenable them a few at a time until you happen accross a problem tweak.Second I will comment on your choice of repo. Insanelyi is a repo which distributes pirated tweaks correct me if im wrong. This could be your problem as youll often find youre running a version or two behind the official tweak from one of the default repos. Now I dont know your reasons for using such repos but I would suggest that you install the official versions wherever possible because youll find you wont get much help here if youre using pirated material plus youll find you have much less issues by using tweaks from the default repos.,jailbreak,cnqvqnz,3,t5_2r8c5

2855270,0,t1_cnsbbb2,As subjective it this is going to be I wholeheartedly disagree. I like the speed of YourTube and ProTube and its extension was way slower.. With YourTube the video quality links are literally instantly available. With the web view app and the extension with ProTube I always had to wait several seconds before the links appear. The p takes even longer to appear? What the heck?. Sometimes the links dont even appear at all and Ill have to tap on the download link again. As mentioned the links with YourTube were almost guaranteed to appear instantly. No waiting for anything to load. Its the way each tweak fetches a videos URL or something.. You had to open a video and actually load the video where its playing to download it. With YourTube you can just do it from the thumbnail page. It was annoying to hear a video playing every time I download a video with ProTube to watch later.. ProTube lagged when downloading videos. YourTube didnt do that at all. Its crazy how fast it was.I now use McTube which is even better than YourTube with the legacy app reducing the number of taps to download a video from  taps to just one or two taps!

2883801,0,t1_cnvrw3f,Hey thanks for your help. We managed to figure it out.Well be pushing Pasithea .. ASAP to fix the bug.Basically theres a nonzero chance that when injected Pasithea will cause sandboxed processes to crash this is due to an error in Pasitheas code.When Cydia installs a package it will always run uicache regardless of what was installed  what was happening here was that Pasithea was being injected into uicache by Substrate. Normally this is okay nothings wrong with that but Pasithea .. sometimes causes sandboxed processes to crash.uicache is sandboxed. So IF Pasithea caused uicache to crash this somehow results in the entirety of Cydia crashing not sure why that happens then it caused the entirety of backboardd and by extension SpringBoard to crash. After a long string of constant crashes the watchdog just gives up and forcefully reboots the entire device... only to land back where it was before  in a boot loop.In other words we screwed up.As for the reason as to how this escaped our testing cycle... well... the only way to reproduce this bug is to reinstall the package via Cydia over and over again. It took me about  tries to reproduce the bug. And you have to test using Cydia SPECIFICALLY  aptget or dpkg wont do as they dont invoke uicache and cause a chain reaction of crashes.,jailbreak,cnvw2oc,2,t5_2r8c5

2975719,0,t3_2u94dj,Part of business is competition. No competition is bad for business.We have a choice now  Cydia or iMods? WinterBoard or Anemone? Personally I think Ill use both  Cydia and WinterBoard are older and made by someone with experience. iMods and Anemone are made to look and feel good. Also theres one other APT store  Proclivity. At least Proclivity uses Cydias payment system while looking nicer so maybe Ill just use that one too.TLDR It doesnt matter what you use competition is good for business and Ill be using them all anyway.Also for Anemone iMods and Proclivity  you have to use Cydia anyway to get them.Its up to the jailbreak utilities creators to choose what software they will put on your phone. Its not hard to go and get a copy of them all either.I think its good that SaurikIT usaurik ubeetling and others will have competition. It means that people are seeing jailbreaking as a business opportunity which means there will be more for us to look forward to in the future. For all hells sake  maybe even Apple will see that they can make more money through jailbreaking!Another TLDR Its up to jailbreak creators to choose what software comes with their jailbreak its not hard to get a copy of the software competition is good for us because more will come out maybe Apple will see the business opportunity.Thank you for reading this superlong comment.

Youre charging  for this tweak. Two years ago this tweak would have been free or . Im all for supporting developers when theyve created something fantastic and worthy of the money but charging  for this is a joke.Your hard work is appreciated but its a joke when something like this is priced at . Lets compare your tweak Harbor is a simple OS X styled dock tweak that redesigns the way it behaves and looks. Thats awesome. Youre charging . for it and its main function is nothing more than simply changing the way your dock looks and acts. Unless Im missing something theres nothing huge about this other than getting to shrink the icons and have them enlarge when touched or scrolled through like you can do on OS X. Compared that simple functionality to something like Springtomize  which is the same price at .. Springtomize  allows you to change so many aspects of the entire iOS system from Lock Screen to Icons to Folders to Animations to Control Center changes to Status Bar tweaks. All of that is priced at the same price as your tweak which changes simply the dock. Im not trying to rip on your tweak at all Im just trying to explain that the pricing is completely ridiculous for such a simple tweak compared to something largely feature driven like Springtomize . If your tweak was . to . I think it would gain much more purchases just from impulse purchases like myself. I can almost guarantee that if your tweak was priced at . at max much more purchases would be coming your way and in the end you end up with more money. But I honestly believe the sweet spot for something like this should be priced at .. I can see this exploding priced at that point.Maybe you just dont understand how sales works or my background in retail and sales and price pointing is just different than yours. In the end your months of late nights and hard work might be worth more than a few pennies to you but for the majority of us a simple dock tweak is not going to merit shelling out  for.Im not trying to disappoint you or discourage you from doing what you like to do which is make tweaks for people but look at it in a different perspective and you just might benefit from it if you change your sales plan.Cheers.,jailbreak,co888dc,-2,t5_2r8c5

Yes wed like to implement a link flair system for rjailbreak much like riOSthemes and we intend to do this when we have a chance to figure out the right system and how best to set up enforcement so flair gets assigned without moderators doing lots of manual work. There are lots of options for this we just have to weigh them and figure out the combination that will work best.For styling when weve talked with lots of readers about various usersuggested CSS ideas people disagreed really heavily on the kind of style that they wanted and eventually we figured that this is inevitable with a community so interested in customizing things to their own preferences. Weve been encouraging people to instead make stylesheets that people can list at rjailbreakwikistylish and choose to apply using a browser extension.Edit here are pastes of the current CSS and current sidebar in case that helps anyone in experimenting with new theme styles.,jailbreak,co913fx,40,t5_2r8c5

3029509,0,t1_cobn5es,Thanks for writing this! The unfortunate part though is that trying to explicitly defend against perceptions of piracy can sort of backfire on you if read by a skeptical person. For example saying that its only a small percentage is tough since there arent any decent studies available that would help determine a real percentage so we just have perceptions and its easy to be skeptical of a perception.That piracy will happen whether jailbreaking is limited or not also isnt going to help a lot since few people believe anyone can really fully stop piracy but a lot of people believe its possible to reduce piracy or at least make it harder.Id suggest trying a different tactic.  For example you could expand on how cool the opportunities are for developers and how jailbreaking inspires a lot of people to learn more!,jailbreak,coc08e9,3,t5_2r8c5

3045079,0,t1_codkvh4,Well I wont tell you Ive done comprehensive studies on this topic Ive never tracked my data usage since I keep within my monthly gb limit but Id assume youre right. The Facebook app itself would use quite a bit to load all the photos as well as text updates whereas ISX is more of a RSS like feed but if you actually look at the FB panel in ISX it does load photos too  albeit smaller thumbnails. My guess would be that it has to load the photos to some extent in the background in order to tell what sort of status update it is and in order to load the thumbnail for the FB feed. It also updates the little box in the upper right corner of the lockscreen that previews different feeds you have this also tells you X shared a photo with x likes and x comments. The FB feed also works from the integrated FB settings. After taking this into consideration Id assume it loads the feed fully in the background. Having said that I spend a lot of time on data with a gb limit and on average use about gb a month gb if I update apps on the go. That was even before I had an iPhone came from Android so I havent noticed a dramatic increase in my usage since having ISX.  Really if Im right and youre cautious over your data set the feed to refresh at manual intervals or longer intervals ISX has settings up to hr periods. That way you can refresh the feed when you want to rather than have it always going in the background. This would help to reduce the consumption caused by the tweak. I also cant tell you that what Ive typed is  accurate since I havent ever looked into this properly but this is how I assume it works. Id call it an educated assumption but like I said I am pretty much a noob and Ive never tracked my data usage too much beyond knowing how much I use per month. Hope this helps a little ,jailbreak,codmdy6,1,t5_2r8c5

They need to rewrite the tools for x and I imagine they are working on this.The jailbreak tool is not really any good to TaiG k or PP if it wont work with the latest iTunes so this makes me think the teams are on it.But for right now I would just stay away from it since theres really no benefit to updating iTunes.

Now that its finally been broken publicly I can look into getting A code exec and keys.  In terms of releasing I see no need for it to be released.

3286712,0,t1_cp2rxxt,You didnt really answer most of my questions. I understand that its about using the NC better because thats the whole point of it.But apparently youre the one that designed it. You cant tell me that So maybe holding the icon you can delete the notifications for that app because you should have thought about it. Why would holding down the icon delete the notifications? iOS  and  have gone in the direction of being somewhat unintuitive with some of its UI under the idea that people are now used to touchscreen gesture conventions like swiping such as swiping left on notifications to reveal interactive notifications which really isnt something obvious because theres no visual indication that the user can do that. But holding down the icon to clear the notifications makes less sense than that. IIRC Apple never uses a long press as a delete or clear its always to bring up a list of actions which is even less used in iOS  because of the extension window or to bring up the ability to move or edit or delete like on the homescreen.Yes pictures in notifications are always small. But youre still removing a feature thats there and the thumbnail still can be useful for people despite being small.And you say most people always open the app look there for missed notifications but you cant say that without actually having that data. Maybe what you say is true maybe what you say isnt true. Some people like to just use the NC to look at their missed notifications and other people like to go into the app. You shouldnt just redesign something without considering these things. Sure jailbreak tweaks are kind of all about redesigning parts of iOS or adding features that iOS lacks. But that doesnt mean you should be sloppy with design. Usability is something that you need to consider.,jailbreak,cp2wtij,6,t5_2r8c5

Really hard to cut the battery power of an iPhone before it gets fried but if you can manage it the phone will have a decent chance of survival. The cause of the water damage is the flow of electricity being directed to other parts of the phone and causing short circuiting so if the flow of electricity can be stopped before very harsh damage is caused you can save it.  ,jailbreak,cph9urg,3,t5_2r8c5

3546110,0,t3_30txk9,Great tweak although personally Im getting a few bugs  The ability to close apps doesnt always work and when I use the stock app closer it leaves translucent grey rectangles when in edit mode. A lot of the activation methods dont work such as the multi finger tap gestures and the fingerprint scanner methods although I do have Virtual Home installed. Those methods that do work such as the multi finger spread or slide in gestures will affect the app sizing andor positioning when using them to turn off edit mode. Video and audio playback on AV Player and some other apps dont always work consistently.The battery life on my  plus seems to be going down a lot quicker even when multify is turned off. This is my biggest concern but am not  sure that it is happening is anyone else experiencing this?That said this is the closest thing to Quasar way back on iOS  and I am more than happy to pay the five bucks for it.

I made this feature because I noticed deezer preferentially picking the clean version and we cant have that!.  Then it launches deezer and plays the track.  It also has a check to make sure that you get results back.  If you do not get results back aka deezer doesnt have the song then Siri will tell you that it cannot find the track on deezer.Then you simply go into assistant and make a capture group command as follows    Trigger Play trackartistortitle on deezer    Variable trackartistortitle URLEncode ON    Command pathtoshellscript trackartistortitle for example varmobileDocumentsdeezerintegration.sh trackartistortitleEnjoy!,jailbreak,cqhwtts,4,t5_2r8c5

As for the image I dont know why Boxys background looks like what it does in the picture. It must have been altered some how. If people want this in Boxy Ill add in a blur radius option.

The fix at the time was to wait for cydia to be updated so it could prepare the file system. It seems to me that semirestore must not be creating or is perhaps removing some of the symbolic links that cydia uses to navigate the file system. I think if we find a way to force cydia to re prepare the file system that his device would become stable again. ,jailbreak,cqv241y,1,t5_2r8c5

4068689,0,t3_375j5e,While it is sometimes hard to see a mistake when one is made that was not the case with iMods. We made a mistake it terms of our time estimate and have been horrible at PR. We were near the app conpletion and thought we would be ready for a mass beta test but we had not foreseen the level of need for a good backend for devs to upload their tweaks for approval and for them to view download stats ans tweak views stuff like that. We had a backend before but it was very primative and did not have a dev portal we decided that we needed a proper dev portal. As such we decided to wait and work on that. But the scope and magnitude of this whole project managing the team and staying motivated started to all be a problem and so our team took a hiatus since February until the start of may. We said we would think about it and see if this was something we would actually interested in continuing or if we would want to work on a simpler project that would have a more certain reception from people. After the three months most of our team concluded that we all liked the concept of iMods and that we were willing to put in more work to make it reach completion. We have lost some devs but we have been working on it again for the past two weeks. Going forward we will put the following things we have learned from our inexperience into use  We wont give ETAs anymore we believe that resulted in stressful situations and very bad PR. When we release beta it will just happen without a heads up.  While we wont do ETAs we believe that it is good to let people know what we have completed working on so that the progress of our work is known and our existence isnt clouded in uncertainty.  We will work on how we present ourselves to the community. We will be clear in what we have and have not done and we will make sure that we dont give false hype. The product should speak for itself. We were immature before and we have learned from it going forward. Our biggest priority now is getting up an updated website that doesnt still say comming soon  xD So in summary mistakes were made we took a break we are continuing to work on it again and we have learned from our mistakes and will try to be more mature going forward. Hope that cleared up some of your questions  ,jailbreak,crk24lz,11,t5_2r8c5

4380875,0,t1_csjfwxi,Uh the jailbreak is done when TaiG finishes. Cydia doesnt partition your device Im not sure why that word is even used on this subreddit. Cydia simply moves ringtones wallpapers and someall? stock apps from one partition to the other to make space for some packages you might install and for dpkg itself.This can be done whenever you wish heck you could keep Cydia on there for months and simply open it later and it would do its thing simply put theres no reason to make space if youre not using it so theres no reason to immediately open Cydia though and its perfectly safe to do it after setting up the device previous jailbreaks were done on a live device with no need to restore and it was safe then and is safe now.,jailbreak,csjgkmb,1,t5_2r8c5

4428098,0,t3_3brqgy,A repo is short form for a repository. It is essentially a website that has all the tweaks you install. Cydia has the main ones installed already but sometimes smaller tweaks will need you to add a separate repo to install them. Thats very easy to do so no need to worry there.A signing window is when the amount of time when Apple allows people to upgradedowngrade to a specific version of iOS. If Apple isnt signing it you cant downgradeupgrade to that iOS version.An untethered jailbreak is the best type of jailbreak because you can restart your device or turn it off normally without having to plug it into your computer each time and use a program to turn it on again.Hope that all made sense. If you have any other questions feel free to ask. ,jailbreak,csoup08,1,t5_2r8c5

4492712,0,t1_cswyeha,A few reasons actually. Running an application as mobile instead of root has some advantages. One... It allows it to be tweaked. Thats already a given. More control over Cydia. Two... Applications running as root dont properly go into the background because the dont properly receive the SIGSTOP signal that iOS gives to an app to fall into the background when multitasking. Before Cydia would fall into the background but animations and other things that Cydia was doing would continue to use processor cycles and drain battery. Third... Its better to not run things as root if theyre not needed to be run as root. Always give an application the lowest amount of access needed for it to function. In Cydias case... mobile works just fine.,jailbreak,cswysfp,8,t5_2r8c5

Not sure what else I can say other than I wont be doing it as I dont want to lose either the computer or my job. Besides if a TaiG Mac jailbreak is released I can easily find a friend with a Mac to help out. I dont know anyone with a PC.

4526314,0,t1_ct15hps,Never thought Id get a reply from saurik. Thanks for everything youve done for the community. I see your point. It should be available for more advanced users to download separately because its generally not going to be used by most users. And downloading a separate tweakapp would not inconvenience most advanced users especially if its from a non default repo. However I think that maybe Cydia should be in charge of disabling tweaks not some rd party application. But the menu for it should be somewhat difficult to access for normal users. For example in android developer settings can only be accessed by tapping the build number in settings many times. This way it would limit the access of advanced options in Cydia to advanced users. Either way though I dont think its a massive issue as no matter the implementation advanced users wouldnt be inconvenienced too much. But I see your point as the average user might accidentally break something if advanced settings were placed inside Cydia. ,jailbreak,ct16h30,2,t5_2r8c5

Could it be reworded to I am a bot created by uhealdb to provide tweak links and descriptions. or a shorter I am a bot. uhealdb is my master.?Also making title category and description bold would help to visually evoke a segmentation between tweak details and bot credits.

So that when you install a tweak you had before it will already be configured the way it was on .. Here is how you update to . Connect your device to your computer and open itunes. Then make an iTunes backup. This will back up your apps music videos tweak settings etc. If you want to back up your tweaks download a tweak called AppInfo. It will make a list of all your tweaks that you can then email to yourself. You can then use that list as reference when you reinstall each tweak manually. Once that is done restore your device. To do this click on Restore iPhone in iTunes. This will wipe your device and update you to .. Now set it up as a new device and then once you reach the homescreen you cn use TaiG to jailbreak it. Now you can open iTunes on your computer again and restore your backup. To do this click on Restore Backup.Thats it! Now you are on . and jailbroken.

Sure it protects the company but thats not the sole reason and not the number one reason either. I dont disagree with you but I get this feeling that you want to drive a wedge between the community and the mods that enforce the rules. It has always been a give and take situation.

Because many new jailbreakers will first of use imods because well theyve heard of it on youtube and by friends. But then they hear they can get the very same tweak for free  they will google it and people will recognize Hey theres a demand on tutorials about how to get imods tweaks for free  and a flood of tutorials how to pirate followed by a bigger flood of pirates will kill down jailbreaks for ever  because someone is going to sue someone sooner or later which ends in more drama than this sub has ever encountered and yes thats incredibly much drama.,jailbreak,ctsg1e5,3,t5_2r8c5

In other words everytime you turn off your device whether you are jailbroken or not you need to connect it to Redsnw in order to boot it up again similar to tethered jailbreaks except that you cant fix this by installing an untethered package.

CyIPList  command line to list all cydia installed packages in terminal. I then take a screenshot of the terminal output which is automatically uploaded to iCloud photo library and available on my computer. I use them as regular backups. Theres also an output text file. Define Activator also TextSearch  activator action to pop up a text input alert so you can define a word on the fly. I like learning new words. It also works as a spell check. I could never get diarrhea right on the first try... except today. Whoa! But I still had to double check. TextSearchpops up the same text input alert and does GoogleYahooBingetc searches in Safari and the dev is working on an update to include the builtin Define sheet as well. Monolingual  command line to remove all nonEnglish language packs on the device more than what iCleaner handles. Safari Inline Videos  repo  its not really a musthave though... NoMusicVolumeLow  repo  prevents music playback volume from dipping when a notification is received. Still plays the notification sound though unlike SilencePlease which mutes it entirely.I have lots more essential musthaves but theyre pretty popular or known so Im not listing them.

Plus just because it took months to complete doesnt mean it was worked on  hours a week for that entire time.  We have no idea how many hours it was worked on.  Also you pointing out minimum wage in one state is completely irrelevant to the conversation at hand not to mention the fact that you have completely ignored the point that I was making and are trying to change the topic to something else entirely for some unknown reason.  Im not arguing whether or not the tweak itself is worth the price being asked Im commenting on the support that we can expect to receive if we do buy it as well as speculating on how long the tweak will run in its current form on whatever jailbreak is out.  Im mentioning the fact that were less than a month away from having a completely new version of iOS and potentially a new jailbreak to come along with that and at that point it is completely reasonable to wonder if this piece of software will be ignored by its developer for the better part of a year just like it has been for  of the life cycle of the current version of iOS.

4963926,0,t3_3iupr3,This tweak has been in semipublic beta for months and I have not received any crash reports for a long time its working perfectly on my testing device so I had no reason to believe there would be any issue in release. I think most issues are down to compatibility problems with other tweaks as its working fine for most and everyone seems to be on .  so this would be the first thing to check tinct is obviously not going to play nice with other tweaks providing the same functionality.While I appreciate that people who have purchased a product that doesnt seem to be working are annoyed emailing or posting makes my phone go to safe mode is literally useless  I still havent received ANY crash reports for tinct. I obviously am not going to consciously release a product that instantly crashes to safe mode therefore it should be clear that Im not aware of the crash and have not experienced it while testing and have no hope of fixing it unless you send me a crash log.TLDR sorry for those with issues its probably incompatibility with other tweaks  SEND ME CRASH LOGSnames of incompatible tweaks,jailbreak,cuk8pjl,3,t5_2r8c5

A post purely based on personal situations experiences and opinions is going to be biased in nature along with a story in the point of view of the person writing said post. Opinions and stories by the way that not everyone else will agree with. Itd be no different than me going to some fast food based reddit page and sayingI like Wendys because they have fresh never frozen beef and natural sea salt on their fries and think McDonalds sucks because Ive heard they put chemicals in their salads to make them look more green plus they use something called pink slime for their beefwhen that would be purely based on my established thoughts and opinions which not everyone else will agree with or share.,jailbreak,cutzqfs,0,t5_2r8c5

5062662,0,t1_cuw5vie,Working with lots of audiocamera gear regularly and with this feature seeping through the market more and more hit record and its already recorded the last sec it doesnt seem to be a big battery drain at all. It would also likely be a high frame rate video to avoid motion blur issues. Sure you could try and capture  still photos in a second or so but thats an engineering nightmare compared to just keeping a fps buffer running.Edit The reason I say theyd use a video rather than a sequence of images is due to compression. Heavy H. compression would allow them to just keep important movement in the shot like whats explained in the comment below. So the wall in the background that doesnt change colour is copypasted into the next frame of the video.  H. compression is used from YouTubeVimeo to your iPhone and beyond in different ways and levels of compression. It wont have much to do with battery life though if this is the case since its only compressing a small bit.,jailbreak,cuw8qfj,1,t5_2r8c5

5265433,0,t1_cvkpde1,I can think of two ways of achieving it though I havent tested either of them.  The easiest would be to change systemversion.plist install the app and IMMEDIATELY revert systemversion.plist. Then modify the info.plist. Obviously as you mentioned this is risky. If you dont reboot or open Cydia you should be okay no guarantees. I am very confident that this would work but do it at your own risk.  The other way would be to download the app in iTunes on your computer put it on your device using iFunBox iExplorer SSH or a funnel and some lubricant. Then change the info.plist in iFile. You might need to install appsync not sure about that. I have not tried this method so Im not sure it will work but I am very confident that it is very safe to try. The biggest reason so many people fuck up their phones when editing the systemversion.plist is that they dont undo the change. If you open Cydia and refresh many of the tweaks you have installed including the jailbreak untether itself and probably substrate and a ton of essential stuff will try to uninstall itself. It will say Essential Upgrade since they are essential packages but they end up uninstalling themselves because they list iOS lt x.x.x as a dependency and you have iOS x.x.x. So long as you dont open Cydia or at the very least dont ignore those upgrades  you will end up in a bootloop which will require DFU mode and a bunch of googling to get out of. Essentially bricked if you are less experienced or technical. I also wouldnt reboot with a modified systemversion.plist Im not sure what happens if you do but it sounds dangerous and unnecessary so dont do it. ,jailbreak,cvkpuia,2,t5_2r8c5

5337973,0,t1_cvtz3x4,This is way more believable than the always listening arguments that Ive heard. I still dont think its feasible to do such a thing and not get caught but your suggestions would definitely help mask their activity. The transfer and processing of that data though seems like it would be way more costly than normal targeted advertisements. Why take the chance that the phone mishears or their servers misinterpret when you can just use a whole host of search analytics to accurately target people. I think its more likely that facebookgoogle are using location data to figure out when two friends are close together for extended periods and then using a combination of eachothers metadata to target both people. Since people tend to discuss important things when they are near each other that would explain the perceived listening. For example  Terry goes over to Gregs house and discusses the new truck hes thinking about buying. Terry has been doing a lot of online research about the truck including locating dealerships. Terry stays at Gregs house for  hours. Greg goes online after Terry leaves and sees targeted advertisements for the dealershipbrand of truck Terry was talking about. He sees this and jumps to the mistaken but completely understandable conclusion that his phone must have been picking up on their conversation. ,jailbreak,cvtzh19,2,t5_2r8c5

An alternative would be to try to put it into safe made and uninstall any recent tweaks that put you into a boot loop. Try shutting down by holding power and home. Hold power to turn back on and as soon as the apple logo appears let go of power and hold the volume up  button for quite a while. This doesnt always work DFU is your best bet. ,jailbreak,cw2r594,1,t5_2r8c5

Just make a backup of your device and then click on Restore iPad in iTunes. This will wipe your device and update you to iOS .. for you. Then you can set it up as a new device and then jailbreak it.

5478742,0,t3_3q48yo,I dont think this redesign helps using Instagram in any way. Youre hiding the navigation away with an extra press or swipe and youre covering up the photo even if its in a slight way with the like and comment buttons. Instagrams current UI allows the user to access all the important parts of the app except the DMs from anywhere else in the app.I also dont think aspect ratio of Instagram photos allows for a portrait photo that would extend as far down as it does in this mockup design. Youd end up seeing the username and location of the next photo anyway which ruins the sleek and minimal look that this is trying to aim for.The swipe menu also ruins the apps implementation of iOSs swipefromlefttogoback gesture. It would take that away in place of a menu of options that were already easily accessible at the bottom of the screen.The Explore mockup ignores what Instagram wants to do with that section which is to have a space for curation and show trending popular hashtags.,jailbreak,cwbykyk,3,t5_2r8c5

Then I uninstall Remove Badges and any of its dependencies Im pretty sure it installs Activator so if you dont use that tweak you can uninstall it along with Remove Badges. You can also remove the two annoying  notifications inside the General and Software Update sections of the Settings app if you want. For this you just gotta modify two plists. You need to delete the following  lines from both the General.plist and Settings.plistampltkeygtcellClassampltkeygtampltstringgtPSBadgedTableCellampltstringgtBoth plist files are found in the folder SystemLibraryPrivateFrameworksPreferencesUI.framework. After you delete those two lines from each plist kill the Settings app from the task switcher and the next time you open Settings those OTA notifications inside the app will be gone!Just make sure to delete only those two lines from each plist. I recommend making backups of each file first just to be safe and then you can delete the backups after everything is all set and working correctly.Let me know if you have any questions. ,jailbreak,cwhpoad,2,t5_2r8c5

When you click the home button to slide back to the homescreen and go back to spotlight is when it works as intended slide to spotlight wait a second for it to configure the app opens up. Just to reiterate the tweak only works as intended if the app has been opened recently. If the app has not been opened recently or has been force closed out of multitasking the tweak just takes you to a black screen. ,jailbreak,cxau9mj,2,t5_2r8c5

You just have to be so careful.I actually purchased a locked iPad mini cellular from eBay just to try to see if downgrading could be hardware based too. I had done it with an iPhone S but I ripped out a section to pcb and the phone refused to turn on again.Opened the iPad up scraped of a resistor and jumped another so it identified as a WiFi iPad mini according to the circuit diagrams and inadvertently bypassed icloud. I abandoned the hardware trial and error with downgrading and closed the iPad back up and use it in my kitchen for entertainment.,jailbreak,cy0uxzi,1,t5_2r8c5

What was the purpose of this comment? Jailbreaking is about customization and creating things that Apple wont. Obviously people want what Im describing in my post as it was near the top of rJailbreak all day today.

Everyone is free to use whichever switcher they like. Its not like this was CoolStars original idea. Competition is good  it forces devs to keep their tweaks updated if they want to charge for them. CoolStar is simply mad that apparently everyone is releasing a switcher at the same time...well thats business. Opportunities dont last forever. ,jailbreak,czf389r,2,t5_2r8c5

6503207,0,t3_44ott8,Its because AMFI actually loads the signature off a specific vnode think of it like the underlying file object only once and stores it in a cache. But since the signature is invalid the process will be killed as soon as a PROTEXEC mapping will be performed off the vnode in question and a page fault is invoked. And even if you change the signature in the actual file for instance by doing ldid S the signature used will be the cached one.To fix just copy the file to some other place remove the original and rename it back. Should do the trick since youre creating a new vnode. This is due to how Pangu applies patches btw but its the only viable way due to kpp.You could also reboot your phone but thats far less convenient than creating a new vnode.,jailbreak,czrzbgt,5,t5_2r8c5

Cause Apple signs during install also it is a difficult process that is not hackable by changing one line. Same way as you cant just add zeros to check and get billions instead of hundred bucks. Its a difficult and complex process that includes a believe boot chain includes server signs includes iCloud protection and many more. Back in the time downgrade appeared in this world people use special keys from your devices iOS to be able to downgrade.

6529414,0,t1_czuf29r,Oh yeah for sure . Switching from android to iOS was unbelievable . Everything is so polished. Another alternative to snapprefs is an actual standalone app called Casper . If youre rooted you can log in with your snapchat token which enables you to fool snapchat into thinking youre not using a third party app . In theory its a nice little work around that should prevent you from getting banned like the other poster mentioned .But this isnt me putting down xposed or android  the amount of customization those two in conjunction allow are insane. If you choose to go down the xposed route  check out a module called gravitybox which allows you to customize and change hundreds of settings.

6542282,0,t1_czw0ur5,It was originally done because theres a bug that prevented the time from displaying in status bar in iOS . Beta .Someone tried to work around that problem through selftroubleshooting then tried to set the date and time way back and see if the bug goes away.Instead when he rebooted the device was bricked. He posted this on the internet thinking it was a bug in iOS . Beta . Then random people on older firmware tested it believing it would either not affect them or would be resolved through a DFU restore.Then those people realized that a DFU restore does absolutely no good. Others fail to believe that and tried. Then they got that problem too.Heck one report suggests this. An Apple Store Genius Bar employee did not believe the validity when a customer sends his iPhone in for repair. He tried to replicate the issue on his own phone. As a result he sent both his own phone and that customers phone into repair...,jailbreak,czw0wpu,6,t5_2r8c5

Youre not doing anything important on Reddit anyway so why not help them? Its way more conducive to a better community than complaining at them.

I swear there are those that just troll the subreddits looking to be a jerk at times.As far as when a Jailbreak will be available for anything since IOS .. no one really knows. You will hear the same predictions speculations so called proofs that someone did it the list goes on. Usually it will drop out of nowhere. Once you see a REAL jailbreak drop you will see endorsements or discussions from the likes of Jay Freemon Saurik which founded Cydia Podg and many other security experts.Not to mention for a week this subreddit will go nuts!,jailbreak,d0n6fgj,2,t5_2r8c5

Then you need to download the ipsw of your current iOS. Go to  and select the currently installed version for your iPhone . Then go into the folder you installed Odysseus on MacLinux there will be a Mac and Linux directory. On Windows there will just be the main directoryPlace the downloaded ipsw in your folder.In the Firmware Bundles folder check if theres a bundle corresponding to the model of your iPhone and the current version of iOS on it. It should be named something like DowniPhone..B.bundle. If its not there go here and you should probably find one. When downloaded itll be in a zip just unpack it and put it in the Firmware Bundles folder.When done open a terminal on MacLinux and on Windows click on the Run Odysseus program.On MacLinux navigate to the installation folder with cd and then the path to the installation directory.Run .ipsw yourDownloadedVersion.ipsw custom.ipsw memoryyourDownloadedVersion is the ipsw you downloaded earlier and custom.ipsw is the name that the custom ipsw will have later.

That maybe the case but I dont think he can release a tool in a few hours that supports iOS ... He had to test it rewrite code etc. that is imho not possible in this time for a single person.In general I think that nowadays a single person must be very talented to work out a fully functional jailbreak on his own.

An apple TV can mirror and there recently have been an influx of programs for both OSX and Windows that allow mirroring but thats about it.  Your best bet would be to get a cheap computer and hook it up to your tv and mirror to it using something like this.EDIT It looks like there are some apps that you can install but it doesnt sound like they work that good.  Maybe just search around on the fire app store and see what you can find.,jailbreak,d3zty5u,1,t5_2r8c5

8041870,0,t1_d4jyp0l,Please dont belittle me. Youre saying the same thing they are. I understand the concept of firmware signing. iTunes talk to the signing servers we get it. I think you might understand less how it works than I do.Back with SHSH blobs we used to be able to cache the success response from those servers and use it over and over again. This response was generated by the signing servers given your devices ECID and a digest of the firmware in question.Something changed and now we cant. I want to know what changed. I assume they factored random numbers or a timestamp into the equation so the result simply cant be cached but I want an indepth technical explanation from someone who knows exactly how it works not someone who thinks they have an idea of how it works and has the audacity to talk down to someone who wants to understand while regurgitating the sameold iTunes talks to the servers story we all know.The level of depth Im asking for is this made up for the sake of clarity iTunes takes a partial digest the IPSW iTunes takes the HMACSHA of your devices ECID  the timestamp and appends that as base  encoded data to the digest iTunes sends that as a base  encoded string encrypted with a public key to the signing servers with the timestamp and your ECID in plaintext Apples servers verify the integrity of the data with their private key before sending back  etc,jailbreak,d4jzcmp,-3,t5_2r8c5

8177542,0,t3_4rbgst,Theres a tactical reason too. A jailbreak is a collection of several exploits. Some exploits might be more useful than others giving access to the system and leading to finding more exploits. Sure all those exploits together could make a jailbreak but would it really be wise to just release them so Apple can patch it? Would it not be more wise to hold onto them to find more exploits in later iOS versions? Naturally theres a balancing act to this. You cant hold onto them forever otherwise nothing would get release ever but since iOS has gotten more and more secure it may be that they need to hold onto these exploits for longer in order to ensure that they can find exploits in future versions.,jailbreak,d4zqqn6,2,t5_2r8c5

8213029,0,t3_4rsqxz,When jailbroken you can avoid voiding your warranty by doing a fresh restore before you bring it in for service. If youre even trying you would have saved SHSH blobs. I would prefer a free warranty fix over my jailbreak honestly.There is no difference between jailbrokenrooted and regular other than underlying system changes that happen ONLY on a system level. There is no ping to the network to tell whoever that your phone has been altered. The only way that would be able to happen is if they get notifications anytime any phone has a systembased change so any updates or restores. But they dont plus they dont care. If you pay your money to be on the network they dont care. Verizon Tmobile sprint they dont give two shits what you do with your phone.As I recall supreme court ruled that it is legal for you to modify electronics that you own in any way you want or some iteration of that of which protected jailbreaking. It is  legal the only person with an issue with it is Apple and all they can do is refuse to give you warranty based service.,jailbreak,d546lnd,1,t5_2r8c5

8352833,0,t3_4tzvvr,Short story on how I found this Ok so I recently fucked up when trying the tweak Upscale. I put in a resolution which was way to high and disabled my screen no visuals what so ever but I noticed that the phone was still responsive since it vibrated when i touched the home button I have VirtualHome  installed. Looking at the existing threads about this problem you needed to have either open SSH or Apple File Conduit  installed to fix this issue by changing the internal file that stores resolution. My iPhone had Open SSH but the WiFi was disabled so I though it was fucked. I remembered doing the QuickTime player mirror thing once when doing a presentation for a course I had in college last year. And what do you know lo and behold even though the iPhone wasnt able to render the bugged resolution my computer was!So I did the above steps and fixed my phone. Im creating this thread because I couldnt find anything similar already  posted and I thought why not help anyone unlucky enough to run into the same issue.,jailbreak,d5lno2h,12,t5_2r8c5

8509603,0,t1_d656yjh,Yeah it works great whenever its actually working. However check back whenever the interface crashes while on a call and you have the call muted because its a conference call and you can no longer end the call or take it off mute because the interface has crashed. And then you get asked a question on the call and cant do anything. That happened to me at least  times prior to current build. Happened first day of current update and instantly removed from my device. When things like apps crash its not a big deal. When your phone app is unresponsive or crashes its another. I had to reboot the phone to get off the call to then call back on. Not worth the headache to me anymore. ,jailbreak,d65982k,9,t5_2r8c5

Firstly I had a stable jb for the last few weeks using the original Chinese version Pangu tool... Then my jb crashed and it DID NOT default to safe mode and give me the option to respring and debug...basically Cydia would not allow me to removeany packages as none neither in the sources list nor my installed tweaks would load...This led me to try and start from scratch with a new jb however I noticed when I factory reset my phone a few tweaks i.e BytaFont AppCake Filza Anemone and Cydia were still showing up on my springboard just like a factory installed app.Unable to open or delete them I tried the new jb tool using Extractor and still no luck. I am able to access Filza but I do not have the directory varlib...What am I missing?? Thanks in advance for help,jailbreak,d66p3se,1,t5_2r8c5

Fingers crossedIm very hesitant to suggest this because it could end with you losing your jb completely so please only use it as a last resort. If you could try cydia eraser again and get it to work rejailbreaking would give you the latest version of cydia substrate to start with and that might fix things.

Open the PPPangu app and wait  seconds.  Click the circle and wait  more seconds. Lock your device after the  seconds. As soon as you see the PP notification hold Volume Up.

All the chaos from the time he dropped ClassicSwitcher. The time he got mad at TweakWiz over vintage switcher And many other things I cant remember right now.Now beside all this I do respect that hes a good developer and I have had times where I flip sides a lot in the past from supporting him and not. And I do understand a lot of drama is thrown at him too. Also I love most of his tweaks and appreciate all the hard work he has put in them and think he has contributed a lot.

The Categories and the Featured Charts work like a charm. Pretty impressive to see this implemented into Cydia tweaks.  Overall the experience is pretty smooth. No lag on my device. Very impressed to see it working with my custom Eclipse  settings so well. That is something I definitely appreciate! Heres a link to what it looks like However I do have a few critiques as any beta tester would. Maybe shorten up or remove unneeded Categories from the Categories tab as there does seem to be a lot.  Possibly clean up the top banner with the slideshow of tweaks... It looks amazing but it has different opacity for me at times and maybe just some minor bug fixes on that would be great! I found a Category at the very bottom of the categories tab named XWindow that seems to be unneeded or is just a bug Ill report back or message you with other bugs or features that I think should be added or removed as I just installed it!

AutoDisabler aka your batterys best friend automatically disables WiFi andor Bluetooth after a user specified period of connection inactivity. What does this mean? When you disconnect from a WiFi network or Bluetooth device your device will automatically turn off WiFi or Bluetooth after a designated amount of time or immediately unless you reconnect to WiFi or a Bluetooth device during the delay period. This is a great way to save battery life by automatically disabling batterydraining radios when they are truly not needed.,jailbreak,d7cfnjg,1,t5_2r8c5

8960067,0,t1_d7ou3mx,They still have adult content in the App Store though...They have games like Grand Theft Auto and other types of apps rated  for nudity violence etc. I understand that its their decision but theres no consistency. They could have a kids mode to hide adult content but they instead ban certain adult content and leave other adult content. I also understand that theyre trying to protect their image but the image I see is that violence and mild nudity is acceptable while images and videos of consensual sex is unacceptable for all people which is just wrong. I think they also still ban apps for having profanity. I just dont understand this way of thinking and I dont like being treated as though I cant handle adult content unless it involves violence. And maybe theyll decide that violence is also unacceptable for all people and ban all violent games they already changed the gun emoji to a water gun. With parental controls and a possible kid mode in the App Store itself I see no need dictating what is and isnt acceptable content to adults that can make their own decisions. rant,jailbreak,d7ov6b3,5,t5_2r8c5

Anything s and newer cant check more than  passcodes in a row without either a time delay after the  attempts the standard lockout after  attempts and increases with each subsequent attempt or giving the secure enclave the correct passcode before the th attempt. So if you already know the passcode then I could make something real quick to give unlimited attempts. ,jailbreak,d7uvuw2,1,t5_2r8c5

As most of us have experienced there is a certain lack of functionality to quickly and easily find the best jailbreak tweaks out there. Actually often one misses the best tweaks altogether because of this. Something Apples App Store had from the beginning featured apps and top charts. We believe this to be a great addition to the jailbreak market and will give our best to provide interesting and useful results. There is a good chance that this will even work better for jailbreak tweaks than for App Store apps because the number of tweaks simply is not as massive as the number of apps on the App Store.,jailbreak,d80gk0p,13,t5_2r8c5

Take the phone to a store and you should be able to get the battery replaced within  minutes.Just on a wild hunch plug your device into a charger that you know for a  fact is working fine. Leave the phone to charge for about  minutes. After that flick the mute switch on and off assuming you left vibrate turned on if your phone vibrates then its the screen thats fried replacing that should take  minutes.If youre lazy just take it to any repair shop and theyll be able to tell you whats wrong with it and what itll cost to fix it.

9681730,0,t3_5dpq84,Well thats pretty interesting. I guess well see in a short time whether youll be thanked by the big cheese or declared the worst person ever hey dont worry you have me in that category too.Another thing holding back contributions is that half of it is some magical html on his server. How do we contribute to that? Playing with the DOM from objc is icky for instance see this Worst thing is webViewdidFinishLoadForFrame is equivalent of onload meaning the button I add doesnt appear till all the images and ads have finished loading and I couldnt find anything equivalent to DOMContentLoaded Im sure theres a way to listen for js events from objc though which didnt occur to me then.Web is the nature of Cydia and its a smart idea executed rather well I once woke up to an essay in my IRC PMs about why he went with web and I still agree with everything he said there so Im absolutely not implying it should become native. But absolutely it adds another barrier to contributions. Back in like  I was trying to get his help so I could improve the layout on iPad he didnt seem pretty interested in helping noob kirb and I gave up in the end. The only change weve seen to improve its iPad UI was an increase of the page maxwidth to make it not have ugly margins on the bigger iPhones. Something as big as Cydia I would have imagined would be so full of contributions and Ive cared to want to make improvements for years but the problem lies with the way the project has always been managed.So I hope you can consider this and work something out to enable contributions to the web components too. Maybe you could also integrate a Theos makefile?,jailbreak,da6h739,29,t5_2r8c5

9768912,0,t1_dafya7c,I am guessing that would be possible for someone who is good at hardware coding.  But I am thinking it would need a driver of some sort like a PC uses in order to talk to the drive.     But if you were to do that the DVD drive is still rather large and draws a lot of power so youd still need some sort of external power to make the drive spin.    And because you can rip movies and music so you can store it to internal memory of your phone I dont know if there would be anyone out there with that sort of expertise that would be willing to take the time to do that sort of thing.   Unless there was an ulterior motive for doing such a thing that would be more useful.    If you are concerned with using space on your phone they are stating to make USB sticks that you can plug into your lightning port. You could store movies to that and plug it into your phone.     Or if you got really daring you might try using one of those drives to see if you can hack it so that you could use the USB to lightning adapter they have on those and see if you could mod it to hook up a DVD drive.     I have no idea if something like that would work but it might be worth a try.   ,jailbreak,dah8guo,1,t5_2r8c5

10002073,0,t3_5itr58,gt .Get prepared Download the ipsw just in time so you already have it when a new stable JB is released.You probably know this already but thats not how IPSWs work you can download them anytime as Apple keeps them on their servers but you cant downgrade to them after Apple closes their signing windows. You can however save the new and improved SHSH blobs and upgrade to whatever version you saved with those blobs if you have a jailbreak. For example you can have .. SHSH blobs saved on jailbroken .. and you can stay on .. until a .. jailbreak comes out and upgrade directly to that even if Apple closes their signing windows. If you dont save your blobs and still want to update youll probably end up upgrading to . or more. So save them blobs!,jailbreak,dbbarjx,2,t5_2r8c5

10011521,0,t1_dbaxnwd,Alright Im noticing one peculiarity. Notifications still work but not properly. Notifications still show on my lockscreen but I cant see the contents of them. If I get a text it will say  text message instead of showing the actual message. Whatsapp will say Press for More instead of showing the actual message. Im not sure if its relate to the downgrade but it seems likely. Im backing up now and going to restore to see if that resolves it.EDIT A restore didnt fix it. After messing around in the notification settings for a while I noticed that Show Previews had been disabled. Im not sure why that happened but Im thinking it must have been caused by the downgrade. So I believe simply Updating to .. from . was fine after all. Im not sure why it changed a preview setting for notifications probably something related to privacy or some policy change.

This post I think isnt necessary its more a post saying THIS IS A BETA ITS FOR USERS TO TEST AND FIND BUGS. IF YOU WANT A JAILBREAK WAIT. Responsible users should install this on a separate phone NOT THEIR DAILY DRIVER if they want to help find bugs Im fine with that as a programmer not a jailbreak dev. Responsible users Ive found are actually quite responsible at doing things like reporting bugs and allowing programmer s to reproduce them.Likewise it clearly says that there will be bugs a lot of the time its not the developers fault. This I can blame to the dev society who I feel dont stress that devs cant make code perfect but also to the users who complain even though they have been told that there will be problems. Many bugs cant be blamed on users or devs.,jailbreak,dbj42ta,1,t5_2r8c5

Some compatible tweaks installed substrate fix got updated has a better icon. Actually resprings fine after a tweak is installed. Just dont be dumb n install tweaks that arent supported. Beta  seems good so far jus sucked when the data went away but there are fixes for it. Not everyone who jailbroke their phone is a developer but no need to bash on em for doing it. You dont call people stupid online when they download betas for pcconsole games.. Edit Im sure youll just have to reboot your phone so its not in jb mode. Delete Mach app if you want to be safe just uninstall all the tweaks. Then when the stable one is released hopefully not a  day cert.

10123927,0,t3_5kwksz,. Apple bricked devices with third party touch id with iOS . if Im not wrong release and even though it seems like a move to add revenue to Apple itself its actually a way to keep the secure enclave untouchable especially with modified Touch ID module imagine xcodeghost version of issue but with Touch ID. iPhone SE was never meant to sell properly its only to get people that wanted  devices to be able to get a newer iPhone. As far as I know it succeeds well heck some reviewers still choose their SE over iPhone  series as they are too big which is exactly the point. iPhone  was the greatest moment of Apple. They released it without an accessory that Apple itself bring to standard and they gave the adapter FOR FREE. Did they give USBC to USBA for the new MacBook last year? Or this year for the XXX new MacBook Pro? Or  pin to lightning adapter  years ago with the iPhone ? No its a move they never did and I was very shocked they actually gave the adapters for free.. MacBook batteries has grown well or supposedly sadly not the case of the new MBP that nobody needs to bring a charger. I barely charges in public space and having a MagSafe port is now only a privilege and no longer a must. Removing it in favour of universal charging port was amazing. Not only you can now charge on either side of the device you can use third party chargers and even portable chargers amazing considering the price of a MagSafe adapter is . iOS  jailbreak and iOS  jailbreak releases almost immediately your argument seems invalid now.. AirPods was delayed and its one of the best move available. Remember how Apple delayed iPhone  white release for trying to figure out how the white colour wont discolour through time? I find Apples delaying AirPods release gives the same attention to detail and reviews prove that AirPods are amazing as a wireless earphones. Dont get me wrong I wont buy a  wireless earphone no matter how good it is as being wireless sound matters more to me than practicality. However AirPods are marketed to be the pioneer in wireless solution not an audiophile solution so as far as I concern it succeeds well,jailbreak,dbr5k72,1,t5_2r8c5

The terminology is commonly used in outside communities so theres no getting away from the word either way.I came from an android phone that I rootedunlock bootloaderflash custom recovery etc. In those communities it was very important to distinguish between soft and hard bricks. Ive soft bricked many android devices on accident by messing with system files and you just use custom recovery to flash a new firmware. But when youre installing a custom recovery menumessing with the kernel you need to know that screwing up can result in a hard brick and unusable phone.This is a smartphone subreddit its not so unreasonable to think that many of us might be coming from android. People are gonna use the word brick and rather than invent new and confusing terminology we should just use whats already commonly accepted and understood.Even if youre not familiar with the term Im pretty sure people can guess the difference between soft and hard bricking.,jailbreak,dbtz74i,3,t5_2r8c5

I decided to take the dive into Yalu and its honestly not as bad as it looked. If you know what you are doing and not installing tweaks that might break your phone then go ahead. But if you are a new jailbreaker and have no clue what cydia is then wait for the stable release. So basically it all depends on your knowledge and your experience but ultimately the choice is yours.

10262540,0,t3_5mvhvt,I have an iPhone because I like that it just works. Ive owned a galaxy s I personally hate that the Samsung phones take the most popular title when it comes to androids because theyre trash after about a year of use lol and I just so happened to be a lucky guy with one of the MDK bootloaders that could install ROMs. Android roms aside I always had problems with the phone. Not big things just littler things like apps closing in the background very quickly poor battery life lag on a phone with  GB of RAM. Apple just has this stupidly good optimization and its hard to turn down honestly. Ive had this iPhone for a year and a few months and I have had  problems on stock iOS and only stupid reversible ones on jailbroken iOS. Its just something that you cant turn down. Apple does this shit pretty well lol and although you cant always have a jailbreak the fluidity of stock iOS is enough to make me content with it.The only phone that would ever make me switch back to android is the pixel. I think that it should be androids flagship and Im glad google is marketing it that way.,jailbreak,dc7bcdl,1,t5_2r8c5

What normally happens is someone you gave your name and phone number to gym membership charity organisation anything... sold your information to some telemarketing groups. Either a rogue employee or unethical company.These telemarketers will usually send text messages like these since they can automate it and narrow down the list to people that are likely to pick up calls since they respond to the text message.I read an LPT once where someone would list the company or service name theyre giving their details to as a first name then their actual name as middle name and last name.

10443795,0,t3_5pk5sy,I actually used to keep up with Lucas twitter a lot during December given I have an iPhone  and was hoping to see a few updates to future betas that pertained to my device. Id often look at the replies as well and honestly you start to get pissed off yourself seeing all the foreigners and impatient kidspeople crying and whining about wen ajelbrek. Its sad.So I took it upon myself to block these people because most of their questions have already been answered and they have a tendency to ask things over and over again which isnt fun to look at when all youre doing is trying to get some information. I must say Ive blocked over  people after reading Lucas tweets and the worst part is that it doesnt help. It gets rid of a vast majority of the annoying tweets but in the same light these people just dont stop.I can understand why hes halted public research because all Ive seen is nothing but ungrateful people and white knighting which is just as annoying as the ungrateful people. Id stop public releases too if day by day Id constantly have to deal with people spamming my mentions about something Ive already spoke upon and started constantly asking me questions that have already been addressed.Thats not to say Luca didnt have his mistakes too but I feel as if his errors are overshadowed by the amount of idiocy seen in his mentions.There was also that jailbreakbuster kid too god he was annoying like super annoying.,jailbreak,dcrvx1n,9,t5_2r8c5

10456983,0,t1_dct4ga3,If you have nothing nice to say dont say anything at all So just because you cant jailbreak no posts about new tweaks or updates are of any concern or interest to you? Worse for the same reasons you feel the only thing worth doing is bashing the dev who has already demonstrated a PoC build of a jailbreak  which many are running just fine?Using your own analogy Luca is the wannabe moviestar and youre some bystander and this community is a group of supportive bystanders you are stepping in and saying this actor is overrated people should stop supporting him he hasnt produced a movie yet I want to see a movie!. I think youre the one pouting and stomping your feet. Even more accurately  this wannabe moviestar just released a trailer for the biggest movie of the year and youre saying hes overrated he never released anything in the past he doesnt deserve any attention.Luca has better things to do than lose money in his career helping people like you.As for the security research part  so what? Would you prefer a device with no security just so you can Jailbreak? Personally I prefer  a device thats almost impossible to crack without a lot of effort and physical access Cydia Impactor etc. The days of click go and jailbreak are probably over so move on. IMO publicly usable just means anyone can access it and use it it does not mean easy. This is publicly usable by that definition. ,jailbreak,dctejo0,1,t5_2r8c5

A few weeks ago I tried using trident and it wasnt compatible with . however the latest trident  kloader worked perfectly. Once the trident app was on my iPad I opened the app and tapped start and the green lines appeared and I let it sit for awhile and I never did get to the point that said Waiti Sleep Exc it said something like wbrt something like that I cant remember of the top of my head what it was I didnt think much of it and still executed the sleep command. After that the device went black as normal however I couldnt get it on and into dfu mode so I had to use the standard way of getting it into dfu mode. Once I was in dfu mode I started the downgrade process with the ispw that was created with beehind all was going well however it got to a point were it said sending ibss and just stopped. It sat for at least  min and did nothing. I also noticed that the beehind logo never showed up on my iPad. Any suggestions would be great! Thanks Again for the tutorial. ,jailbreak,dctowob,1,t5_2r8c5

I know some people have money issues and cant afford  the new iPhone  I wouldnt take one even if it was free anyways your going to need to get a  bit device. Yeah I know you may have just got that phone or some story like that but you are not going to get a jailbreak with it. Just find a way to get like an iPhone  or something.

Meta refers to a discussion about a topic usually this is selfreferential got that word from the Urban Dictionary definition.So for this subreddit an on topic post would be about jailbreaking such as a question asking about an issue with a tweak or news about a new jailbreak release.

10560391,0,t1_dd51y1u,Literally all three comments are misinformation. uplya Your comment is just useless. Maybe OP didnt have access to internet for a week maybe he missed the signing window you never know.utomdublin Tihmstar is the creator of the tool Prometheus which has been out for a while now.uthatmffm Its worked for plenty of people. The Touch ID issue was because the iOS . SEP was incompatible with the iOS .. SEP and a security enclave issue was formed as a result which broke Touch ID. iOS .. SEP is compatible with the . SEP and as such updating from iOS .. using the Baseband and SEP from .. to get to . will work perfectly fine. The reason why it didnt work for many people was because they fucked up their blobs. They forgot to specify Boardconfig or messed up somewhere else along the way. The verification tool from Tihmstar actually gives false results when verifying blobs because obviously it doesnt know your devices Boardconfig. If it says that the blob is valid then check the Boardconfig it displays and see if it matches with your devices.Goes without saying that you have to be jailbroken in order to do any of this besides saving Blobs. iOS .. might not allow you to downgrade to iOS . just so you know. They might be fixing shit so that you cant get Nonce collisions. However being jailbroken on iOS .. will let you update to iOS . while .. is still signed.,jailbreak,dd551aj,3,t5_2r8c5

10579983,0,t1_dd77usd,Lance in contrast reached out to me with both a report of the issue and some example code he had so I could see how to use the new API without having to learn what that API was find a tutorial and do some testing. The update from Lance did not come with some snark about how Apple had told us the API was deprecated a while ago implying that I should have fixed this a long time ago in fact it came with empathy for supporting older systems as he himself ran into this same API no longer existing while he was updating Icon Support.If this developer had tried as hard to reach out to me about that as he did about the repository issue he had last week and provided the actual code for his update which he really should have done anyway I made Safe Mode LGPL on purpose to make certain people didnt try to pull stuff like this I could have  found out that something was wrong  found out what was wrong and  gotten a fix out for all users a month ago. However instead I find out about this from a random user tagging me in a thread a month later even though Im actively talking to this developer on another thread?As for the patch the new API requires the usage of ObjectiveC blocks. It is not clear to me that I can push a binary that uses blocks and have the binary load correctly on iOS  which is a critical firmware as it is the terminal firmware for some popular devices. It might be possible to use weak linking but then it would break on iOS  as the ObjectiveC runtime at that point didnt support weak linking. As it stands despite the comment about how the class I used was deprecated that is what Apple continued to use inside of SpringBoard and did so up until iOS . So I only need to fix iOS .This code will thereby support all devices that are bit and will support all bit devices before iOS . The only place where this code fails is bit devices running iOS  and currently we dont have any. I will probably fix that by throwing in an armvs slice as I dont think there were armvs devices running really old runtimes I believe Ive used this trick before though maybe Im thinking of something related Im doing in Substrate that isnt the same but I am going to think through that update later as I still have time.,jailbreak,dd78rfj,15,t5_2r8c5

Ive heard people on more restrictive carriers like ATampT and Verizon say theyve been able to use GB in more rural and suburban areas where towers are rarely if ever congested. In major metropolitan areas especially during peak hours pm to am Id be careful and try to keep it as minimal as possible. On more forgiving carriers like TMobile and Sprint the worry shouldnt be as heavy but you still need to be careful and try to keep it below GB in my opinion.,jailbreak,dd7u2rt,1,t5_2r8c5

10588096,0,t1_dd7n1l0,You should never use postinst for that kind of thing. Like if it werent the case that safe mode happened to be extra safe that would be horrific as postinst has no particular guarantee of execution timing. One could use extrainst but generally the usage of package scripts should be a last resort. There are ways to do that using plist filters which I might otherwise say would be the right way to do this but then this project would have to use a more custom build environment instead of Theos and this project is sadly using Theos in a misguided attempt to make people think the project easier to work with. Using architecture filtering is highly deterministic is extremely powerful is the fastest way to pull this off at runtime is fully compatible with Theos and is already implemented as I stated elsewhere in this thread Ive also now done the armvs slice for bit iOS  which I can push next week...

10625357,0,t1_ddbx6gs,Im not entirely sure why Im being downvoted but OK. As you all know a digital display uses three colors to display everything red green and blue. What f.lux does is reduce the blue light which is why everything looks more orangey. Personally Night Shift feels more like a filter rather than an actual reduction of blue light. What I meant by removes a lot of the blue light was a reduction in the intensity of the blue light. Furthermore Night Shift vs. f.lux isnt fact its preference. I prefer f.lux that doesnt mean anything to anyone except myself. You guys can and should use whatever you want. EDIT Dont take my word for it. If you want to learn where f.lux started as well as the point behind all of these night shift features check out the research links on f.luxs website.,jailbreak,ddbxaj4,0,t5_2r8c5

Once those were good I followed all the steps in the tutorial but I couldnt do the last one because I never installed the dependencies. Like an idiot I installed the dependencies while my phone was in DFU mode because I disabled nvram reboot. The dependencies took longer than  minutes to install and as you may know DFU phones reboot after  minutes. What I ended up having to do is download the tool mentioned in the other post to get my phone out of DFU mode enabled tfp again and ran nonceEnabler again. When I followed all the steps in the other post now everything worked flawlessly. You pics make it look like you already have your nonce set to your generator key. Have you tried just running the last step to update skipping the set com.apple step? Also its weird to me that in one of your pics it says com.appl instead of com.apple,jailbreak,ddtdkc8,1,t5_2r8c5

10871762,0,t1_de0o4om,Its not really an exploit per se. It relies on having access to your terminal then simply opening a connection to a rogue server and downloading files a backdoor. These files use already builtin shell commands to do their nefarious work.One way could be to check for the optional Substrate dylib Eggshell Pro which aims to farm more data than is normally accessible.The only other way is to use package hashes and make sure that everything you download is unmodified in anyway.I guess a third more difficult way would be to check for binaries w extra permissions e.g. Androids this application is requesting camera access but that would take much longer.,jailbreak,de1cf5x,2,t5_2r8c5

10882016,0,t3_5vj0cn,Rule rjailbreak does not allow piracy tools sources or websites. Additionally do not post or advertise products or services that are in violation of the trademarks of others.This includes but is not limited to    Piracy repositories    Promoting the use of any programs which is used for piracy    Bypassing payment for premium features    Media piracy such as music movies and games.    Installing redistributed free paid removed and banned apps    Mirror links unless the mirror is provided by the original developer        Cases of fraud such as tools or instructions for obtaining reallife paid objects for free eg duplicating coupons to get free burgersExplanation of our Trademark RuleExplanation of our nonpiracy ruleOur community policy on rjailbreak is to not discuss or support piracy tools sources or websites mods will remove commentsposts that mention them. All of us here care about jailbreaking and pirating apps and tweaks hurts the jailbreaking ecosystem  partly because it gives us a bad name but mostly because it means that developers including some members of this subreddit dont get paid for their hard work which can discourage them from continuing to maintain and develop great software for everyone. And pirated software is often buggy and outofdate which causes irritating problems for both developers and you. Also jailbreaking is probably legal in your jurisdiction but copyright infringement almost certainly isnt.In other words no discussion of crackedredistributed tweaks and apps or the repositories and tools you use to get them where to download ROMs or BIOSes for emulators theyre copyrighted software too how to pirate copyrighted songsmoviesmedia redistributing copyrighted software tweaks and apps without permission even if they were originally free since this is still copyright infringement unofficial mirrors of software etc. No discussion of tools for getting inapp purchases or paid subscriptions for free. If you ask about why your pirated tweak isnt working well just remove the post and suggest that you buy it. Also for the peace of the subreddit please omit piracy tool icons from your screenshots.When a tool is in a gray area of copyright infringement we follow the lead of the default repositories  if its on a default repository its OK to discuss here. For example we allow discussion of neutral tools that clearly have multiple purposes beyond piracy and are not promoted by the authors as piracy tools such as YouTube downloaders there are many videos on YouTube where downloading short clips for noncommercial usage especially of noncommercial videos can be considered fair use and generalpurpose torrenting clients the torrenting clients on the default repositories are neutral tools that have the same support for any kind of content legitimate or illegitimate and their marketing and features do not encourage use for piracy. The default repositories host several ad blockers of various kinds so those can be discussed as well note that ad blocking seems to be legal and doesnt involve copyright infringement.In general we consider breaking Terms of Service and End User License Agreements such as the ones we break to jailbreak our devices to be acceptable if its not also copyright infringement or fraud or some other type of illegal activity and copyright infringement and fraud not acceptable.Its good to note that this rule isnt about prohibiting revenue loss  there are lots of forms of revenue loss that nearly everyone considers legal such as people publishing competing products and copyright infringement of a free app often doesnt involve revenue loss.If youre not sure whether the moderators will consider a tool to be a piracy tool please feel free to message the moderators and ask.If youre not sure whether a certain tweak or theme is worth purchasing try starting a thread asking for opinions. Also keep in mind that if you purchase a package that turns out to be disappointing you can ask the developer for assistance and if that doesnt help you can use the refund methods provided by PayPal.To be consistent please also dont post tools or instructions for fraudulently getting reallife paid objects for free such as coupon duplicators.,jailbreak,de2ei5k,4,t5_2r8c5

Do not take what these people say about your personal DRM ulaughingquoll unless these people post a receipt that they have paid for your tweak then ignore them all. This sub is toxic with a bunch of thieves and people who lie about stealing. I have seen so many Devs leave here due to how unwelcoming and demanding so many are. And it isnt everyone in here but the top posts and comments are usually liars. I pirate some tweaks and Buy others but thats my choice. I at least do not jump on someone comment and excite them. But this sub is terrible to people and honestly developers can always JB all iOS versions but for what this community has attracted no wonder we live in a time of no teams or public devs. I read through so many comments in this sub and its worse than rthedonald,jailbreak,de8hbo5,5,t5_2r8c5

10986121,0,t1_ded8k9g,Tweaks are stored in a different directory from your music apple apps and photos etc. so you dont really have much space for tweaks especially on a  gb device. You can get the stashing tweak from Coolstars repo or run iCleaner to clear some space for tweaks. Or you can uninstall tweaks you dont need. In iCleaner if you have it the top bar is the space you have for tweaks and the bottom bar is the space you have left for everything else thats not tweaks.,jailbreak,ded8pyl,1,t5_2r8c5

People suddenly took that to mean beta  magically became stable without a single update and they were okay to install it when in reality nothing has changed since December.

Then no all you would have to do is rejailbreak and go into filza and delete the .bak or what ever is added to the deamons name. As long as you do your research and not disable deamons that can put you in a boot loop if removed. Plus now you can sign apps on your own device.

But he was so certain and arrogant about it being Karens fault that he didnt bother.He should also have removed the tweak as soon as someone said it has caused them a bootloop to further investigate the issue. But he was too obsessed with his ego blaming others instead and swearing that it wasnt his tweak for a second time.I get that people defended him for his first fuckup but this time around it has just gotten pathetic.,jailbreak,df35f91,2,t5_2r8c5

I had this a little while back your filesystem has been corrupted either by tampering in the files or a tweaksource. Bad news is that video wont work for you because youre on iOS  but good news is you can backup and run Cydia Eraser which still works for iOS . That will completely reset everything except some tweak settings and make your phone like it was brand new. Use a backup to save your stuff I recommend iTunes and restore it back after Eraser is done working then once your stuff is back you can rejailbreak using PanGu.

But Im almost positive I never saw this dropping to G behavior until I installed PIA VPN  which makes sense given the posts about trouble using it over LTE. I did uninstall CommCenter manually after deciding not to use CarrierCrack because it was locking onto G instead of LTE so maybe that has something to do with it.

11610378,0,t3_65ma1b,There seems to be some misinformation here. When you install Stashing it stashes all the tweaks that are already on your device in addition to stashing future installed tweaks. Every time Stashing is run including when it is installed it stashes all applicable unstashed tweaks on your device. I use the qualifier applicable as I believe Stashing is taught to ignore certain programs like Cydia CrashReporter and possibly others. Think of stashing as like.. cleaning a messy house and installed tweaks are the mess. When you install Stashing it cleans and when you install a tweak it cleans. No matter what you wind up with all your tweaks stashed and your house clean.,jailbreak,dgc1ope,1,t5_2r8c5

11674064,1,t1_dgj7xxt,iBoot AFAIK is integrated in the bootrom hence iBoot meaning you cant really patch it with an OTA update rather a whole new bootrom revision is necessary.  This means that apple in order to patch it apple would need to replace it or give you a new phone with the new bootrom.  A bootrom jailbreak guarantees a tethered jailbreak at the minimum and with a userland exploit you can get an untether ezpz.  Having a bootrom exploit is the crown fucking jewel of jailbreaking and will net you  or more! through Apples new bug bounty program. Edit forgot that he said that it wasnt a bootrom exploit however iBoot is still hardware related AFAIKEdit  yea nevermind its software fml still a powerful exploit though.,jailbreak,dgj9s3l,-1,t5_2r8c5

11705017,0,t3_66w6i6,I am a lurker here in rjailbreak so I cant speak about the mods. I would however like to give my two cents about possible improvements to this sub. First off I would like to limit Snapchat tweaks to a pinned thread exclusively for Snapchat. Maybe one for battery life too? These two topics seem to come up quite often especially with less experienced jail breakers.Many comments in this thread suggest populating rjailbreakrequests with the requests from this subreddit. I would like to second this notion. Those that do not want to subscribe would not be subject to the flood of requests. Developers could sort through the requests as they would here. Ideally a sort of kickstarterlike system for requests would be created but that would be beyond the Reddit site.In the same vain as utilizing rjalibreak many comments here suggest creating rjailbreakhelp. I do not believe this would be a good idea. I do not have any hard facts to back this up aside from my own reasoning. Humor me for a moment and hear me out. I dont believe that enough people with the technical knowledge would subscribe to rjailbreak help in order to provide adequate help. In the event all jailbreaking questions were routed there the initial good semaritians would be overwhelmed or burnt out. I am arguing for rjailbreakrequests and not rjailbreak help because prospective developers would want to sort through requests because they could make a profit out of it. Rjailbreakhelp would rely on the kindness of people to help without a profit involved. I do believe people would help at first but overtime that help would decline in response to the repetition of questions.I hate to shoot down a suggested solution without providing a solution of my own but I dont have one here.Im typing from mobile and its rather late so please excuse any grammaticalspelling errors.Finally something we all could do to help out this subUSE THE GODDAMN SEARCH BAR YOUR QUESTION HAS PROBABLY BEEN ASKED BEFORE,jailbreak,dgms9a7,1,t5_2r8c5

11724679,0,t3_679za7,I would recommend getting involved in a bit of Reverse Engineering. For instance I have some iOS Reverse Engineering tutorials on my channel. By the way creating Jailbreaks is just the fruit of the security research you do on the device. So If you dont know it already learn C or even C. Some will tell you to start with an easier language like Python or C I dont understand how is C an easy programming language tho I wouldnt recommend doing so. C  C is the heart and the soul of the security research because it is very lowlevel just like Assembly a good grasp of ARM Assembly would also be required. Building an exploit requires having a vulnerability that you will exploit in the first place. The vulnerability can be anything A buffer overflow a stack overflow a heap overflow. Once you understand a bit how an iOS app is built  and you get some basic reverse engineering skills like how to use Hopper Disassembler or how to interpret some basic opcode start fiddling with DVIA or Myriam App I have created Myriam app so I can help you here. These apps are vulnerable apps that you need to exploit  they contain various hacking challenges ranging from very easy to very hard.To actually JAILBREAK once you mastered the technique of fuzzing searching for vulns and once you know how to use the vulnerabilities you should start looking on Yalus source code assuming that you know ObjectiveC  which is a must. IT will help you make an idea on how different parts of the jailbreak are being implemented and what is usually being attacked on the Kernel. Knowing the security mitigations implemented by Apple in the Kernel like Null bytes Data Execution Protection DEP ASLR and kASLR KPP CodeSign various other canaries etc. will help you understand what you want to patch and how. You can ask me various questions on my twitter if so you wish FCE,jailbreak,dgp0tw1,79,t5_2r8c5
