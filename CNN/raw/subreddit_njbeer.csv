3103777,0,t1_cojozbp,It was a brewery only release last May. They should be doing it again this year around the same time. They do bottle releases every once in a while.,njbeer,cojpegn,2,t5_31cbe
3160987,0,t3_2w4ptj,I found both at the Bottle King on  in East Windsor. I was asking for Nugget Nectar which they were out of but the guy stocking beer let me know that they had the new Sculpins in the back by request only.

5919857,0,t1_cxvm1a7,It honestly just seems like Kane doesnt want to sell this beer. They dont want to bother with people showing up to buy it. I cant say I blame them with how everyone is an entitled asshole regarding it. But damn. Just stop fucking making it if you cant man up and create a plan to sell them. They had  year to plan for this and it seems like theyve been thinking about it for about  days. I personally dont really care. Just more reasons to keep me away from releases like this and I think Im far more sane for it anyway. This shit just cracks me up. ,njbeer,cxvmhwa,2,t5_31cbe

8977742,0,t1_d7pobot,Exactly. Knowing what odub tastes like you can have one of the variants and see what additional flavors you get from the added hops. Kane had an event a couple years ago where all they had was single hop IPAs. Really gave a good example on what each hop does to the taste. It was at that event I discovered I like Citra hops the best!,njbeer,d7qzl1h,3,t5_31cbe

9689253,0,t1_da7anl6, agree. Carton is good dont get me wrong but Kane is GREAT.  Literally havent had a bad beer only beer I disliked was Corjito and only because it was aged in Tequila barrels and I really do not like tequila. If you guys get a chance try Party Wave it really is top notch. Im spoiled living ish mins away. Sitting here drinking Sunday Brunch at the brewery right now!  The new IIPA Wind Swell is great too but I still like Party Wave as their best IPA has such amazing flavors. ,njbeer,da7em2m,2,t5_31cbe
