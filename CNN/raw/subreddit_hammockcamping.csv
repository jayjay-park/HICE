1823392,0,t1_ck8njrr,Heh.  Blame the folks in rUltralight for that purchase.  I needed a second nice tarp because my Bride wanted her own setup.  The SuperFly was a great size but the oz before cord was a bit heavy.  It also required the perfect tree to do side by side.  bunk style was forbidden by management  Once in a while I will do a trip where I just pack a tarp and a bit of tyvek floor.  and my back suffers for it  Had a bonus burning a hole in my pocket.  Since my sleeping bags are down the misting in heavy storms was worrisome.  A bit of spray treatment on the old SuperFly fixed the issue.

The only thing youre doing right here is the fact that youve owned up to your mistake. However I still dont see why you refuse to refund the money. Youve fessed up and made it painfully obvious that you dropped the ball. Business  would dictate that when a customer asks for a refund in a situation such as this you dont hesitate. If you dont want to be called a scammer dont take money from people then refuse to either refund or deliver. Honestly if you ever planned on actually making the hammock dont bother.

3471678,0,t1_cpnp9cv,Your insulation will leak everything has a heat transfer coefficient if youre familiar at all with circuits the simple analogy is resistersimpedance in series  think of each layerbarrier is a resister.  In general shelters work best with preventing convective heat loss from wind and weather.  However air is a great insulator and the pocket in your shelter couldshould be warmer than sitting out in the open.  Just for another easy analogy think of tents.In general two people in a tent is warmer than one a smaller tent is warmer than a larger tent assuming same materials and what not.  Two people make it warmer because youre heating the space faster and putting more heat into the air.  A smaller tent is warmer because there is less air your body heat is trying to keep warm less surface area for loss as well through the shelter walls.  You can apply the latter example to a hammock set up.  Its worth noting that venting is still important to some extent because in the winter condensation is a real thing warm air holds more moisture than cold which youre breathing out wet warm air when it drops in temperature the air cant hold as much and water droplets form the enemy of cold fighting gear.Your tarp isnt coming close to providing the insulation your clothes and topbottom are.  However if the air temperature inside the tarp is C C C whatever C warmer itll increase the efficiency of your gear by reducing the temperature gradient and consequently flow of heat out of you.  Hopefully youre not at the limit but I know its helped me tow the line between survival and comfort rating on my bag before.there is a fair amount of generalized thermodynamics in there hopefully no physics major comes along and slaughters me  I was trying to make it simple and applicable to camping.  I dont use fancy things just a general blue tarp I picked up at REI for a few bucks Lowes HomeDepot Wally world all carry them.  You should definitely take something for shelter rainsnowice are no joke when its cold.edit  fuck thanks for the gold!,hammockcamping,cpnzvrc,3,t5_329b1

3861087,0,t3_34moro,So the super cheap ones on Amazon  arent terrible if you are shorter but keep in mind for these you are still going to have to buy a suspension system they tend to just include biners or S hooks and all the other stuff to make hammocking work. So when you consider that you can get a full  hammock from Dutch for about  more its worth it. Everyone that has tried longer hammocks will be quick to tell you just how much more comfortable they are. If you check out Dutchs stuff youll notice you can get a hammock suspension system and a bugnet for between  and . It will be a full proper system that you could keep for a very long time and would be super comfortable.There are lots of ways to make these things yourself if this is too much. You can actually make pretty nice hammocks with a little bit of trial and error. I recommend checking out ripstopbytheroll.com if you go that route.,hammockcamping,cqwecqo,3,t5_329b1

4941102,0,t3_3iiq49,I have see  a YouTube video when Shug was demonstrating Ridge lines and proper hang angle when he ripped his hammock with it being too tight. He was using whoopie slings and the hammock gave first.  But it was a well used hammock and it was at a very tight angle. I have a couple of hammocks and I know it doesnt get much love around here because its heavy and whatnot but my ENO doublenest with Atlas suspension is still the one that I feel most comfortable abusing.  I have had me lbs my wife lbsand both of my daughters combined lbs in it at the same time and my daughters were jumping around and putting a lot of load on it.  It didnt seem to be overly stressed. My niece has an ENO double and she had three football players totalling well over lbs in it and she had the stitching on one of the loops of the Atlas straps pull out.  The carabiner just fell to the next loop an it didnt fail completely.  I would have thought that the momentum would rip out the next loop also but apparently it didnt.  The hammock held up though. My Dutch Poly D is my most comfortable hammock and the fabric seems plenty strong.  Probably as strong as the ENO but Im still not as confident in the whoopie slings.  I have Dutch titanium hooks and I can see where the hook kind of smashes the Amsteel and makes it kind of whitish color like its maybe starting to fray at a micro level or taking some sort of damage.  But I havent seen any strands fray out or anything so I dont know exactly how strong it is.  I would suspect that the suspension would go before the hammock provided that there is nothing sharp in the hammock that might start a tear. ,hammockcamping,cuhd5iy,6,t5_329b1

5225532,0,t1_cvfs25r,That is correct. Sorry wasnt being intentionally vague. As for why I moved the hook to the fixed end...Like most of us I have a lot of suspension components and switch stuff out periodically to try to find what works best for me. I got these whoopies with the hooks and larksheaded them onto straps like urealslacker was saying and used dutch clips around the tree. After a little while I found that set up took me longer and was more limiting so I undid the larkshead and went back to a toggle and marlinspike hitch. Then it was just a preference thing. I like having the tail of the adjustable end towards the hammock.So now I have a strap with a dutch clip around the tree then a marlin spike hitch with toggle over which I put the adjustable loop of my whoopie on the other end of which is a fixed eye with a dutch hook in it the continuous loop larksheaded through the end channel of my hammock goes on that. For me thats plenty fast and light and highly adjustable and modular. ,hammockcamping,cvfv931,4,t5_329b1

Short of load testing each anchorage I wouldnt trust them.  If theyre embedded sleeves the required rear may not have been installed around it or it was put to close to the edge to allow the rear to have proper anchorage.  If they are postinstalled anchors was the right size hole drilled for the given anchor size was the hole properly cleaned out before setting the anchor did the substitute epoxy anchors okay in shear but not as good in tension and very susceptible to fail if the hole is not properly cleaned out in place of expansion bolts?  And that assumes that everything was properly sized.  There are so many things that can go wrong with balcony railings that it is honestly safer to just not place too much faith in them.  Talk to some construction insurance folks and youll quickly find out how common problems are.  And unlike most water problems number  insurance item this is a lifethreatening one.

8012180,0,t3_4oh3p4,I was about to post a very similar question but I think Ill pass on it now.I can surely say there will never be a time I want to lay on the ground but I may want to camp in places where I must.Last year I day hiked the Bigelows in Maine.  Two gorgeous k peaks with stunning  degree views from the top.  They overlook Flagstaff lake and the other mountains in Maines high peak region.  There is a nice campsite at the col between the two peaks.  Since day hiking the peaks Ive wanted to go back and camp at the col so I could watch the sunset and sunrise from the peaks.  Ive never seen the sun rise or set from the top of a mountain before and the col is a perfect place to sleep as its a short hike to either peak.All this to say that the campsite at the col is in the alpine zone and the trees are much too small from which to hang.  There is another campsite a mile or so down the mountain but its a real steep climb especially if you were climbing back down after sunset is less than optimal light.  Theres yet another campsite but its a few miles away over some equally steep grades.  So I suppose my question wouldnt be how could I go to ground just in case... but how could I most efficiently reuse some of my hammock kit as a ground kit when I know Ill be ground camping it?Back to OPs question I can comment on the Superfly and hammockgear cuben tarps Ive got the  with doors not the winter palace.  Both are great tarps hands down.  Both have great coverage and are incredibly well made.There are a few differences between the two.   Weight Price OpacityWeight and price are pretty straight forward but the opacity didnt hit me until I actually spent a night under the cuben tarp.  At night it is REALLY cool to have a semitransparent tarp to look though  doubly so during a full moon.  You can really see out into your environment and to me at least it feels more like Im out in the woods and less segregated from them.  In the morning however it can be a drag as the extra light coming through from the sun can wake you up earlier than you might like.On the other hand my wife hates the cuben tarp because likes feeling like shes off in her own little world and not actually out in nature gotta love her she still goes out though!.  She kind of feels safe not being able to see whats out there.  While I disagree with her logic I can understand where shes coming from.  Also she gets the benefit of being able to more easily sleep in each morning as the Superfly lets little light through.I love the cuben tarp all around.  Its unbelievable how light the thing feels.,hammockcamping,d4gn6ii,1,t5_329b1

10275628,0,t3_5n3mu0,It will work but most people dont like bivies and how they restricts their movement. You will likely have trouble sleeping deeply in the ENO if you are close to six feet tall as it is a shorter hammock that restricts your ability to lay flat. ,hammockcamping,dc8sqjk,2,t5_329b1

10465806,0,t1_dcueioe,Possibly though Im trying to find a solution that would work while a bug net was attached. I probably should have said that.,hammockcamping,dcuem4g,2,t5_329b1
10514658,0,t1_dczm6yh,No its basically bubble wrap encased in a silver reflective coating. Its semi ridgid too. ,hammockcamping,dczy67l,2,t5_329b1
10525113,0,t1_dd0hizg,I saw the turtle dog stands and considered those but dont like the idea of carrying the big pole for down the middle. Its that pole necessary If I anchor instead? ,hammockcamping,dd14wkk,1,t5_329b1
10727726,0,t1_ddmgwqj,Somewhat yes. Im only looking to continue with threeseason backpacking and since a pad has worked fine for me so far Im not too keen on spending too much more for a different system. What would you recommend as a lowerend option that would replace a pad for nights down to F?,hammockcamping,ddmhgr6,2,t5_329b1
10795850,0,t3_5udch7,Honestly  were taking about a tarp.  Its  pieces of cloth joined down the middle and hemmed around the edges.  Many folks go the DIY route for these because the are so easy and theres lots of quality kits available.  If Joe Blow can whip one of these up without a problem  so can a guy who makes money selling them.  Personally  Id go for the lighter option.  Its thinner  but this isnt a climbing jacket  you dont need abrasion resistance.,hammockcamping,ddtijul,5,t5_329b1
10864708,0,t1_de0b1a4,Dutch sells lashit and also a .mm line he calls just dyneema that comes in a few different colors. Im not sure exactly the difference but Ive found it a lot easier to work with when splicing. Seems like its something to do with how the dyneema is braided versus the lashit. ,hammockcamping,de0m8vm,1,t5_329b1

10964436,0,t1_deap76s,You can get about an extra  degrees of cold with a season UQ.  The pad systems are cheaper more robust more rainresistant and dont require near as much fiddling around.OTOH they do not envelope you in the cocoon of warmth that an UQ does.,hammockcamping,deawkfr,1,t5_329b1
11006977,0,t1_defh4sv,I made one but I never use it. Its x flat and the hammock fits reasonably well. For heavier fabric I would make it an inch or two bigger just to be safe.,hammockcamping,deflyyb,2,t5_329b1
11136244,0,t1_deu86s2,Your remedy is the best solution.,hammockcamping,deua653,1,t5_329b1
11282232,0,t1_dfadd3m,Thats what Im thinking. Its  for both UQ and TQ for a  degree version. Seems like a really good deal to me.,hammockcamping,dfatopn,3,t5_329b1
11381735,0,t3_62bxso,Jarbidges are made and shipping next day right now. ,hammockcamping,dfm3ml7,3,t5_329b1
11590735,0,t3_64yz3g,Im  and Ive got a  AHE Jarbidge thats wholly sufficient. I WANT a full length underquilt anyways. Probably going to be the HG ECON  as right now its the best bang for the money. I hammock at home every night so a full length means I can go to bed with just a blanket vs. dealing with anything under my feet. ,hammockcamping,dg9tgdg,1,t5_329b1
