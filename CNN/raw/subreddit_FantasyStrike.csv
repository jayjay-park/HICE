Tournaments are different to the ladder system though. As for which system is best at deciding skill... probably tournaments but tournaments only show who is really good within the group of people who entered. Someone could be the best player in the world but didnt enter that particular tournament so the tournament winner isnt necessarily the best player in the world but the player who won all the matches they needed to in that tournament.
