2017953,0,t3_2hv1nu,Inshock vs esx      Inshock no longer have Michu but they do have Loord who has renamed himself mnk. So they still have the players for the loordhyper combination.  esx have also lost their awper nrkkkk.   esx have beaten Unnamed and taken a map off of Nostalgie and club. This was all on the th June though according to gosugamers.   Michus not playing for Inshock.      Personally I will bet mid on Inshock if they stay on . They have had a mixed season against far better teams than esx  loss to OG  lost to KCK. Plus in the case of a likely DDOS they end to forfeit.        Titan vs VP       Both of these guys have been inconsistent. Titan did terrible wrecked on LAN then did pretty well online afterwards  except yesterday.  against DAT and went to overtime with CHW.   Michu is standing in for Pasza dealing with MiniBiceps but he is a great player who will fit Paszas role well.   Personally I will go low Titan on this if odds are gt for them and low on VP if odds are gtfor them. Titan being inconsistent before a big match is not a solid indicator and on DDCache Cache could well be picked their double AWP setup can spell the end for a T side.   ,CSGOanalyses,ckwcyq9,2,t5_33qhp
