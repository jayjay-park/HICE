10620899,0,t1_ddbgm3k,Thanks! I actually informed them via an ingame ticket maybe you could do the same? Show them that stuff is happening.Honestly cant see why this game should be any less popular than Sky Force or the Phoenix games.,HAWKFreedomSquad,ddbgrdz,1,t5_3ivjd
10638708,0,t3_5s8x3d,Felt like damage taken is higher ,HAWKFreedomSquad,dddaur2,1,t5_3ivjd
10881135,0,t3_5vevzr,I consider myself fairly decent for making it to the last level of assault using only  A ranked plane a handful of half leveled B ranks and the sparrow.  I still had a couple B ranks left by the time i got there but my DPS was so low that I couldnt keep up.  Should have a couple decent A ranks by next week so it should be cake.Really surprised they dont make Assault longer with a couple other story bosses like the tank and helicopter dude.  Maybe thats what they intend to add later.Would love it if someone can find a way to fix the sound issue double or triple the speed when recorded but i assume its just a bug.  I might have to record my sound separate when im playing then marry the  in post if i make more videos.,HAWKFreedomSquad,de2b8f1,1,t5_3ivjd

11284386,0,t3_6124xs,From story missions past  you would mostly get white level  gear anyway and from arcade you only get white  and s as always.The difference is the store which allows you to buy blue level  gear without the gamble making purple gear for about  crystals a sure thing.So in my opinion gear farming has actually improved.,HAWKFreedomSquad,dfb2h2v,1,t5_3ivjd
11321569,0,t1_dffa17s,Yeah I agree but her rail gun fires more often thankfully. Man still cant believe I denied your request probably had a bunch and just clicked x without looking.,HAWKFreedomSquad,dffa4b0,1,t5_3ivjd

11561943,0,t1_dg6e5ka,I really appreciate your explanation.I never played ASSALT mode. I saw a post here and I will try to follow it to be able to do it.I will need at least three aircraft to reach the  stars. Phoenix  Blitzer  Greataxe So it will take me a long time to get a RANK S.What would be best to go through the ASSALT mode PATRIOT or SNIPER?So I would accumulate the gems to buy the cheaper ships and then finally release the WRAITH !!!,HAWKFreedomSquad,dg6jub5,1,t5_3ivjd
11567747,0,t1_dg73azi,i did not see that information in my game. How can you know it?,HAWKFreedomSquad,dg77jzy,1,t5_3ivjd
11602150,0,t3_65kyzu,Boxes will never give IV gear.    Save your crystals and use crystals and Bro Points in the shops to buy IV blue gear directly. Then blend in black box.,HAWKFreedomSquad,dgb42kt,2,t5_3ivjd
11791358,0,t3_688cn7,Yeah like DKzDK said you will need  gems to do upgrade in the plane... But after u do it you will use coins again to take the  until  lvl after this to do upgrade to rank A to S you will need to pay  gems again... this work with brobots too when u upgrade the rank of them.,HAWKFreedomSquad,dgwl97i,3,t5_3ivjd
11794338,0,t3_68aevo,Thats a very well made spreadsheet for us.I thank you kindly for making it and I will definitely screenshot it for future references. ,HAWKFreedomSquad,dgwxf6l,2,t5_3ivjd
