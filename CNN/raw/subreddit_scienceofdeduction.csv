199521,0,t3_1q06wr,Well heres my quick take on it.First on the door it seems to me like it should be a secondary entrance since the table is partially blocking the entryway door swings in but not an interior door due to the locks used doesnt lead to a hallway hidden by blinds but most likely directly facing the street. The blind use seems to be a cheap cloth properly draped over so they have yet to replace it with proper blinds. You mostly see these when new owners move in since the old ones usually leave with the nice furnishings. On the right seems to be a window casing letting in a very white light most likely due to the reflection of the sun on the extensive snow just outside so northern climatesee winter candle.Im going to guess the young lady recently moved in to a new home and her dad is there to commemorate something or other most likely the acquisition of said home by baking something on the stove notice the pan handle pancakes at pm? Seems highly unlikely...There is clearly a baby in the house see the bottle and the plug cover but there is no plug cover on the top outlet which seems baffling as there doesnt seem to be any short table to put any electronics that would be plugged in to that uncovered outlet.The toaster the stove all in pristine cleaning condition same with the counter still reinforcing the idea of a new acquisitionmove.The Frames in the upper right dont denote any family pictures but are seemingly handdrawn so it leads us to believe that there is at least another child in the household who can draw snowmen of the appropriate colors so maybe  yr old?Thats all Ive got.,scienceofdeduction,cf161ml,1,t5_2w0r1

It probably had a couple of owners before it found its way to you in California where your books depict. Also you didnt omit the vans license plate in front of you CA is the only state to have a license plate design like that so that was a freebie as California on your books could have been a textbook company if I were to play the Devils advocate.I was going to bat off some more probability observations.

2077223,0,t3_2inu37,Just to point out some easy things your friend Robbie asked if you wanted to hang out or go to a party on Tuesday the th but you only accepted after you received some money into your bank account from Bank SA so youre from South Australia. Your friend Luke couldnt go and you told him the next day it was boring it was probably something at a friends place since barsclubs are usually at least a little fun also there arent many clubs in Adelaide which are open and worth going to on a Tuesday.Im guessing youve recently sold a car to a scrapper based on the sms from U Pull It. Although it looks like the VIP program is only useful if youre buying something there so maybe you bought a car or some parts? U Pull It is in both the northern suburbs and down south but since theres more of a culture of rebuilding cars and the like in the northern suburbs its likely you live north of Adelaide. Ill take a random guess and say around Mobdury or Mawson Lakes or maybe even Elizabeth. Also you still live with your parents judging by the sms from your mother could be way off with that one and since you went out on a Tuesday itd be more likely youre studying at a university or TAFE as you wouldnt have school at am the next day.Im not sure what to make of the sms from Kath since the sentence is cut off but I suppose you were asking her if she could take your shift for Tuesday night?Howd I do?,scienceofdeduction,cl3uz9d,7,t5_2w0r1

You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You also pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others statements without satisfactory proof. But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others.

These are rather large targets as you can see and this is from a distance of  feet. The blue target was first and you can see the whole first magazine went lowleft. The second target when a little bit better. But not by much. I definitely am going to need some more practice with this gun if I want to be effective with it. ,scienceofdeduction,d90srca,1,t5_2w0r1

10569133,0,t3_5qdfrm,Right handed. A bit arty. dry hands ? Is that bottle hand cream or glue? Judging by the older iphone box ether a person who is ifitsnotbrokendontreplaceit or not all that well off. Perhaps it was a gift. Not an adult yet but sophomorejunior year. Perhaps you enjoy tinkering? Car freshener could mean you have a car. Medication bottles on the shelf could be any number of aliments but you have what looks like nose sprayeye drops by the car freshener so higher chance of allergy meds and as I cannot see the bottle text I cannot confirm this. There also appears to be a tube of medicated ointment with the  eye dropsnose spray and If my first one was right it could be egsima i cannot spell it and for dry skin. otherwise topical ointment can cover a very wide range of symptoms..,scienceofdeduction,dd64fij,1,t5_2w0r1

10911554,0,t1_de5essp,Being on a tight schedule I skimmed mostly. I could have given more specific info about stuff.By leftist  I say it in the context of present day left  sjw and feminists. I read one of your post which was about opening borders and you were on the side of keeping them close and having people face the consequences of violating the nations security. Which is against what most of the left believes.By self aware  I mean aware of your thoughts. It was in reference to the comment you made about mixing up Spanish and German words. At first I actually looked up Daytona  I guessed it was a specific event but turned out it was annual. Then I stumbled across the post which said you came home and TV singing about Dale Earnhardts death. In the post you mentioned you were twelve at the time so I looked up his death which was in  and then calculated your age from there. Similarly you had mentioned you developed an interest in Nascar  etc. In  so what why I said around years you got a taste for it.,scienceofdeduction,de5g6vy,2,t5_2w0r1
