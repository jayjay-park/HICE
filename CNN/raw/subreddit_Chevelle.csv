5210513,0,t1_cvdtisd,Ah thats sweet! Yes I do try to tune them similarly to those of the songs Ill be recording. I personally prefer the hi tom setup but dont mind a double one. However playing it this way I can make sure the covers are the most helpful to other drummers who might want to play this tune with any setup! Hehe. But its not always spot on accurate and I do sometimes bring out the nd hitom. The tomsection of this song should actually have been played with  up down but at least it works! Regarding double bass Id like to get into it more I do have one and rarely play it due to focus of time on other things. My hihat foot is indeed pretty strong which actually is causing some double bass problems haha! Theyre very different techniques and I tend to play ghost notes in between accents due to how I usually keep time. So its a challenge to change up! ,Chevelle,cve25hw,2,t5_2t6ov
