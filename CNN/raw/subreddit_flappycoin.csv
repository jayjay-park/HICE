669298,0,t3_21tfld,Good post!Some opinion from me on the matter of exchanges and exchange rate. Presence on exchanges gives visibility.  Its a tiny bit of free advertisement.. Presence on exchanges gives people a fast and easy place to get some FlappyCoin.  If your local pizza place starts accepting FlappyCoin at a discount an exchange is a good place to convert some of your hoarded DogeBTCLTC to flappy pizza money.  Mining until you can afford a pizza takes very long.. Exchanges drive the price down to market value which is currently less than  sat.  Thats super cheap!  I bought two million Flap yesterday.  If youre in Flappy for the long term the current low price is a thing to be praised not feared.When the infrastructure improves and the halvings start kicking in Flappys value will rise naturally.,flappycoin,cggcjqf,3,t5_30cf1

822443,0,t1_cgxj8kh,Sir thank you for your honesty but I completely disagree with your sir.  We do need as your describe talking a whole lot of talking.  The lack of communication was one among many primary causes of the unmitigated disaster last weekend and not the delay in the wallet client which by the way many members of the community believe is not the highest priority at this time.It is a conflict of interest for you sir to be deleting posts critical of the devs team behavior last weekend. Restore these posts now.Restore the posts as described here and any others that you ghostedOur strong community is not only comprised of devs and moderators who are free at anytime to delete comments which are an important element of restoring confidence and transparency and an incentive for accountability. Sir many people are investing not only their very valuable time as your describe we recognize that you have invested your time and talent but there are many people who have invested serious financial resources into this community.Please respond confirming you have restored these comments.,flappycoin,cgxri0a,0,t5_30cf1
844496,0,t1_ch062jm,They are certainly there for a reason.We increased version number from ... to ....There was a mistake before it was compiled pointed out and fixed.Sorry if you feel thats unacceptable for correcting a mistake before compiling.They are also there for a reason. We understand that. Sometimes something is missed and needs correcting.No one should of compiled that source or used that source as that was stated multiple times.We are dealing with fixing the issue caused by pool operators updating earlytrying to mitigate all damage.If you would like to help you may join us.,flappycoin,ch09u2h,1,t5_30cf1
