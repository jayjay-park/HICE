This kind of snobbery from collectors is disgusting. Theyre going to print more boxes? Great more power to them! The whole idea is to have a nice box with extras for awesome indie games which is a promise that they deliver upon month after month. I will agree that some of the collectibles are sometimes of lower quality but overall Indiebox provides a great product. If youre going to be a snob and unsub do it now so others can benefit from a great product. ,theindiebox,d65bx2k,12,t5_31e8p

The bug that caused this has been identified and fixed and we will be refunding the charges. Look for an email with more details soon ,theindiebox,d6ju1jj,2,t5_31e8p
8663731,0,t3_4ygvnc,I hope everybody here is using the Suggest A Game box at the bottom of the homepage too so it gets recorded Personally Id love to see an Oxenfree box. That game has been on my radar for a while and it would be a great excuse to finally play it. And yeah Stardew Valley would be dope.,theindiebox,d6ol1vu,1,t5_31e8p
9790994,0,t3_5feqbj,Not sure what youre asking for. Are you asking what the value of the boxes you have are? Are you looking to sell the boxes? Im sure there are more than a couple people on here that would be willing to buy youre copy of Teslagrad and probably any other boxes you have. eBay is probably going to be your best route for selling them. Check sold listings for Indieboxes not active listings.,theindiebox,dajybj1,2,t5_31e8p
