176252,0,t1_ceyg1zy,One thing I never understood about the laptop initiative is why give them to standard one pupils? If literacy rates are so low why not improve on those first and then give the laptops to the slightly older pupils so that they could make better use of this opportunity. The amount of cell phone owners in Kenya is amazing. The fact that MPesa was a service first used in Kenya shows that we are able to go much further in terms of technology. I think the reason we do not produce our own cellphones is because the cost can be too high only large volume production will lead to reduced costs and businesses are afraid of taking this venture as they are unsure whether the market would accept these products.I totally agree with you on your last point. A lot of our future relies heavily on our leaders. Until they fully look to improve the nation and not just improve their own lives then we will never see our vast potential turn into reality.,Kenya,ceyicki,2,t5_2rcjg

9166565,0,t3_55ncna,gt I dont talk about it simply because not being religious is seen as the worst atrocity after being gay. Probably because to most Kenyans interpretation non religious  devil worshipergt Why does anyone have to identify to any religion to be seen as normal.I think the primary reason for this is because of values.All religions make one identify with certain values which they aspire to. e.g Christians value lifehonestyfairnessforgivenessfamily e.t.c Dealing with someone who isnt religious to some extentmeans you have no marker for what they valuewhich makes most people uncomfortable.gtI mean the most religious of the lot seem to be the most sinful in the first placeALL Christians are sinners and sin is sin according to our religion.We all aspire to be Christ like daily and we all knowits not easy.Lastlywould it be better to be a christian and die and find that there is no afterlife or would it be better to be an atheist and after dying you find that theres an afterlife??,Kenya,d8dxgi0,1,t5_2rcjg
