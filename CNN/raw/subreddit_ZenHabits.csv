1283179,0,t1_cidwt4t,Nope Im legit. People just dont try hard they dont actually even believe the stuff they supposedly base their lives on so they only halfass it. It took too long they dont deem themselves worthy they doubt the messenger all manifestations of the ego maintaining old ways. They assume its all just metaphors and some of it is but then they dont really get the metaphors in the first place. Esoteric texts were difficult to understand when they were written. Now that everything has been added to and translated as well as the original context and culture disappearing the stories lose their connotations and subtleties leaving the first layer.Im extremely intelligent and these are all conclusions that took years of awareness and selfexperimentation with reality not drugs to verify. I find no surprise in the fact that my conclusions resonate with spiritual teachings because those teachers were in the same reality as I. What else would you expect?If you really feel anything I say necessitates further clarification just ask and I might be able to expand on what I said and fill in some blanks I left for the sake of brevity.

1599049,0,t3_2cl9ud,I like it. It emphasizes persistence. However I have devised my own method which takes into account the principle of resistance.Its just one attitude and three simple steps.The attitude The results dont matter what matters is that you take action and carve an appropriate amount of time every day thus enforcing a constant habit. Processorientation instead of resultorientation. Try to enjoy doing the process as much as you can.With that said the  steps are. Carve up time every day towards whatever you want to accomplish ie. one hour working on your work project one gym session etc... Make a list as thorough as possible of everything you have to do. For great advice on how to keep a good organizational system check out Getting Things Done. Make sure you keep it uptodate. This is also a habit you have to train.. Once you are in your commited time choose the item that you want to do the least from your list. Then do it.The beauty behind this is that the things that generate the most resistance to us are the ones that generally will yield the greatest gains teach us the most and are generally the cause of most of our procrastination. When you focus on these first and you adopt a processorientation then you are going to speed up your success with nitroglycerin.,ZenHabits,cjgq9c9,7,t5_2qlm4
1976665,0,t1_ckrdo3y,My guess is the causation goes both ways. I find a lot of depression to be a negative feedback loop too depressed to get out of bed and leave the house gt more depressed because didnt get out of bed or leave the house. So I bet its true that a lot of depressed people have a more difficult time thinking about their goals clearly and this in return makes them even more depressed. Depressed or not though its good advice for anyone to think of small concrete and achievable goals to work toward. Depression may make that process more difficult but its probably worth the effort.For me personally I derive a lot of enjoyment in working toward small goals. But there was a time where I always had my head in the clouds dreaming too big and abstractly. And that often led to more pain than pleasure.,ZenHabits,ckrdzgi,6,t5_2qlm4

3342852,0,t1_cp98urw,Actually Ive thought a lot about this type of thing. Time is finite when it is your time to go thats it. Sure you can look at eating well and exercising as buying more time but like the other commenter said that still wont change you getting killed accidentally due to outside forces. Im not just spewing what sounds good and I certainly dont live my life that way. My dreams and goals give me drive to continue moving forwards. The time we have is a gift from God or the universe or even by chance we have been given life and given time here in this world in this existence. The article here echoes that old phrase timemoney but money isnt the focus here time is. The article is trying to point out that each minute in every day we have is potential and opportunity. We wouldnt waste k so why waste the  thousand minutes. The point to what I said still remains. That time is the most precious resource a human has. It is completely and totally  finite and despite eating well and exercising you will never accrue more time and you cannot make more than what you have. ,ZenHabits,cp9b61s,3,t5_2qlm4

I already use Sunday as my weekend preparation day with food planning and a review of the week to come so this would be a nice addition I think.  I wanted to add that I think a nice addition to this system might be to set aside a few minutes at the end of the day before bed to write down three goals for the next day and to review yourself on how you performed on the goals you set the day before.  Also note anything you want to dive deeper into for your big journal entry at the end of the week.  This is a bit more productivity oriented but I have found focusing on my own performance has led to a lot of self reflection.   and helps guide my week.

4555894,0,t1_ct4oooi,Greetings Devil! College is an interesting example to talk about.First I have no doubt those around you would be encouraging but unfortunately this doesnt resolve the issue. In cases like this I think actions speak louder than words.If you ask folks if you should go to college and learn almost everyone will be supportive. Then again there may also be those who try to warn you from the sizable student debts but well leave that out of this.When we hear college in media and conversations what sort of imagery pops into our heads? If we compare the number of intellectuallyinspiring stories that are presented about college to the number of stories about college being a place for wild parties and poor decisions which do you think we have more of?How many folks do you think go to college and are legitimately excited for their futures in comparison to the number that go because they dont know what else to do and maybe they can make some friends?These answers arent set in stone and vary depending on where youre from but I definitely think these questions and their answers are worth considering. Im not condemning society just pointing out some things about us that we may prefer to ignore.P.S. Also think about peoples reactions to various degree choices. Do you notice a trend of positivity for those majors which are focused on production of servicesproducts or that pay well enough to allow the individual to become a larger consumer.,ZenHabits,ct4w30c,1,t5_2qlm4

In my case I consider having a pretty productive facebook front page I maintain my friend number to a considerably low level by doing regular cleanups. I Only keep people I know and only people I could recognize on picture they post without looking at their name. I have  friends approx also I likefollow only things I consider worth it. And always do regular thinning sessions of pages I consider that post too often and post stuff not worth it. Some I unfollow some I just delete completely.Also there is the option to block content from some page when one of your friend keep liking shitty stuff and you dont care about it but dont want to delete him so for exemple I got a friend I want to keep in my friend list but he always post shit about football and I really dont care about football so I just blocked the content from the page he always likes so no more football crap on mine.

5852244,0,t3_3varb3,gt  You really wanted to win but the fear of losing was greater than the excitement of winning.Stuff like this is such bull shit. Yes the chances Of You Succeeding Is Slim if you think the only way to win at life is by constantly pushing yourself to get more and do more. By definition youll never be satisfied. Isnt the real goal to learn how to be satisfied with what we have and with who we are right now? Isnt that the only path to true happiness? gt So next time youre on the crossroads of making a difficult decision always remember that taking risks is the only way you have a chance of actually achieving something worthwhile. I think we all agree that the only thing worthwhile is happiness. But all youll find at the end of a challenge after taking a risk is temporary shallow happiness. Chasing one challenge after another is like running on a mousewheel. True peace and happiness only comes from accepting yourself and accepting your life. It is not something you get from any external event but from an internal realization that youre on a mousewheel and the only way to be happy is to get off the wheel. ,ZenHabits,cxmr9t6,1,t5_2qlm4

We impact other people in ways that are good bad and everything in between  and those memories that stick will either be the heaven or hell we occupy in the hearts and minds of others. As an example bear with me Jesus lives today because of a written memory redacted edited forgotten invented retold in the minds of millions of people. This is an afterlife not necessarily the one the Christian church envisions but it is a set of beliefs and values a personality of sorts that goes on existing and propagates. But the limit of this afterlife exists as well. If the earth were struck tomorrow by a catastrophic disaster super volcano asteroid disease that wiped out every living human being then the current idea of Jesus would not exist until another sentient species came along and created its own messiah with similar values to reiterate.       It does not seem as rich an afterlife as the major religions promise but leaving a legacy worthy of remembering seems pretty important in its own right. This article reaffirms the idea that even though I dont believe in a classic heavenhell afterlife I can see why and how mythologies of every sort will inevitably create one to encourage good behaviours. If removed from the unknown we try to focus on doing things worth remembering we may be rewarded with an ongoing presence even after we fall back asleep in the state we were in before we were born. ,ZenHabits,d26ptv9,3,t5_2qlm4
