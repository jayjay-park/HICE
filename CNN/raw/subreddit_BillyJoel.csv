His cameo was nowhere near the level of Stings but it didnt detract from my experience.  Im a bit younger than you and enjoyed the wide age range at the show.  Id love to go again and again but that would get expensive fast.,BillyJoel,cmi92p4,2,t5_2sqkp
5891532,0,t3_3vyyjz,I cant choose a favorite at all  At least I know most of Storm Front is a favorite of mine and so is Glass Houses......and River of Dreams...Worst song is easier but imo Billy Joel does not sing any songs that are actually bad as I understand bad. More like he has some songs that arent so hot. I dont really like When in Rome...,BillyJoel,cxrwwxs,1,t5_2sqkp
