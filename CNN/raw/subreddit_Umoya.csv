2288760,0,t3_2lfg11,Umoya is a tribe with a long and checkered past but one whose origins can be traced to a canoe. Now of course this was no ordinary canoe. his canoe held certain powers. One of the powers was the ability to quickly transport humans to their destination. The story of how the canoe came to possess these mystic powers is a pretty fascinating tale but unfortunately not the one were here to tell.Today we tell the tale of the powerful warrior who traveled through the rivers of the jungle to protect his land. His name was Zachary. Zachary the powerful warrior had a gentle heart. Not one gentle heart but two. This gave him the strength to empathize with odd things  like for instance this mahogany teleportationcanoe.Thanks to his ability Zachary could always tell how the canoe was feeling. See Zachary was the only one who knew his mahogany colored canoe had absorbed the spirit of a young warrior who came before him. Zacharys knowledge of the mahogany canoe origins made him a little crazy at times. After all that canoewarrior had seen things... things that would scar a canoe for a lifetime. The canoe had many passages in its long history not all had survived. One of these passengers haunted him more than all the rest. The passenger seemed to have the spirit of an older angry gentleman. This voyage had happened shortly after the young warriors spirit had first been imbibed into the canoe which meant that the spirit was still instilled with rage at its unfair situation. The first passenger was attempting to get home to his family after a  year long war.This war had been fought over a very special piece of land. The land that was rich in soil and would provide ample living space for his people. The land was covered with beautiful silky green grass that lulled you to sleep. A sleep that only a baby could dream of having on a warm summer afternoon. There was a peacefulness to the land as the whistling wind blew. This only increased the desirability of the land which led the competing tribe intaba to try and seize the land from the peaceful umoya. Intaba began to forcefully fight Umoya for the land which was the beginning of the  year war. All thought the Intaba were formidable opponents they could not match the enthusiasm and resources of the Umoya tribe. As Umoya prevailed their tribe was more united and stronger than ever before. Unfortunately a sacrifice had to be made. That sacrifice came in the form of a tribe member named Chad. Chad was no normal human being. Chads blatant disloyalty cost him his life. ,Umoya,clulv86,1,t5_34cg8
