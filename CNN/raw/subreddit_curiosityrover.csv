The mosaic uses mostly full frame MAHLI images but due to an issue with the camera not all of the full frames are available so they have used the thumbnails which causes blurring of that area. However we can get to enjoy the image of Curiosity at its current work site at the Pahrump Hills.  Hopefully the full frames will become available soon and the mosaic can be updated.,curiosityrover,cnrf8tv,11,t5_2uov2

3968393,0,t1_cr8bom7,Thank you this is awesome information! Any word on exactly what minerals were found in the sedimentary layers? I would guess at least silicates.. and native elements? Active tectonics and flowing liquid water probably means life when ya get right down to it. Its quite possible that life as we know it could have come from Mars. I cant wait until we figure out the rest of this Planet. ,curiosityrover,cr8mplq,3,t5_2uov2

After its last drive the rover now sits at a record elevation above landing of . meters. After it completes its Dune campaign it will likely backtrack and rejoin the Lewis amp Clark Trail to resume its trek to the mountain via the Murray Buttes and the Clay amp Hematite Ridge... Going to be a heck of a journey...  ,curiosityrover,cygnm1p,5,t5_2uov2

The green could suggest Olivine deosits in the dune sand but more likely just post processing of the original image by the ASU as these are built from HiRISE images Ill try and find the original base image they have used and see what colours they actually are in this region. ,curiosityrover,d0bo80b,2,t5_2uov2
6887485,0,t3_4a36yi,Curiosity Mission Update from Ryan Anderson March th Sols  Climbing up onto Naukluft PlateauIts time to wrap up our investigation of the interesting nodules at the contact between the Murray and Stimson formations and resume driving!The weekend starts off focused mostly on contact science. On Sol  APXS will analyze two neighboring locations on a group of nodules collectively called Khomas and then on Sol  APXS will analyze a third location on Khomas. MAHLI will collect supporting images and will also take some pictures of the targets Etendeka and Maieberg.In the morning on Sol  the rover will make some atmospheric measurements using Navcam Mastcam and ChemCam followed by a spot ChemCam analysis of the target Marienfluss right across the MurrayStimson contact. Mastcam will take a support image of Marienfluss plus a small mosaic of a target called Kerpfenkliff.Then on Sol  we will get moving again with a  meter drive that should take us up onto the Naukluft plateau. During the drive MARDI will collect some images of the terrain underneath the rover. After the drive we have postdrive imaging and I added a request for some Navcam images of Mt. Sharp to help target potential long distance ChemCam RMI images next week. Full report ,curiosityrover,d0x0htd,1,t5_2uov2

I was just wondering if that could possibly have been the case given theyd previously made those observations.Heres a question if we cant be sure our rovers are uncontaminated how will we find out if there is any life within any liquid we do find if were not allowed to inspect it? Are we to just wait until such times we can be sure our rovers are sterile?,curiosityrover,d47t2bd,2,t5_2uov2

9110442,0,t3_552ggl,Each year student engineering teams from around the world immerse themselves in designing building and testing the next generation of Mars Rovers. Then they pack it up and head off to the annual University Rover Challenge competition at the Mars Desert Research Station in Hanksville Utah United States. In this grueling Marslike environment they test their rover and themselves in a series of events such as traversing remote scientific analysis and retrieval and manipulation. Now in its th year this challenging ordeal has proved to be extremely rewarding for the students as individuals but also benefits the entire field of space exploration by stimulating innovation and inspiring the next generation of talent who will take us forward.This documentary video was produced as a way to raise awareness of this entry point for space exploration for students in STEM Science Technology Engineering amp Mathematics education and to showcase the experience these university students receive as they create technology that may one day work alongside human explorers in the field.Thanks to everyone who continues to support the vision of STEM education and Space Exploration.,curiosityrover,d86xess,1,t5_2uov2

11538588,0,t3_64oxep,Sols  Keep on drivingCuriosity Rover Mission Update From Ken Herkenhoff th April MSL drove about  meters on Sol  and another drive is planned for Sol .  Before the drive lots of targeted remote sensing is planned  ChemCam and Right Mastcam will observe a bright rock named Peaks Island an exposure of bedding dubbed Great Wass Island a sand ripple called Baldpate Mountain and an interesting rock that was selected by AEGIS after the Sol  drive now named Chebeague Island.  Mastcam will also acquire a stereo mosaic of outcrops toward the south in the direction of the planned drive.  Planning is restricted this week so two sols were planned today.  Untargeted remote sensing planned for Sol  includes passive no laser ChemCam sky observations and two ground LIBS targets selected using the AEGIS software.  Navcam will then search for dust devils and clouds before the rover rests in preparation for Wednesdays plan.Dates of planned rover activities described in these reports are subject to change due to a variety of factors related to the Martian environment communication relays and rover status.
