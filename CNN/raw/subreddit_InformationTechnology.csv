1317818,0,t1_ciht1r5,I agree with the Certification route. Just gotta find out what you want to specialize in. Decide if you want to go more of an applications route or an engineerhardwarenetwork route. Thats how my department kind of separates us once we get into Level . Im just Level  right now but Im working on Cisco Certs specifically CCNA and then branch into Network SecurityCrypto. If you have an idea of what you sort of want to do it makes the task of sifting through hundreds of certs a lot easier.,InformationTechnology,cihvdqv,1,t5_2sg67

Once its cloned and used on the the Solid State Drive it will be inop on the HDD. Unless you use both drives. SSD as a boot device and the HDD as a storage. But thats a different story. TLDR You can clone your HDD info onto the new SSD. Im not sure if thats your question or not sorry. Let me know Ill help you out.,InformationTechnology,cjalmxt,2,t5_2sg67

The A certification has changed since I took it  years ago but from what I understand its still pretty easy. You have the option to specialize when taking the test.     There are many areas of IT. You can be a system admin exchange admin programmer network admin help desk tech hardware tech and any combination of these depending on the size of the company you get into. I do a little bit of all of these things. This is in no way a list of all IT areas the list is so extensive I couldnt begin to list even half of the professions blanked by the IT title. ,InformationTechnology,cpp8415,1,t5_2sg67

5355486,0,t3_3ob75u,If you want to be a programmer.  Do CS.  If you want to get into IT a  year degree isnt necessarily the way to go.  I started in IT with my A and Net about  years ago.  THAT BEING SAID its a bit of a grueling climb if you go the certification route and having a degree does give you more options.  Im actually going back now to finish a  year degree at WGU.  The main reason I went there is that while you are earning your degree you are also earning industry certifications.   And really any education be it Certification or Degree... gets trumped most times by experience.  except in instances where the degreecert gets you past HRNow if you want to sorta be in the tech world but want to go more the managerbusiness route that is what CIS is for.  note I also hate CIS it spits out people who think they understand technology when they really dont but I have a propensity to hate most modern approaches to management be it related to IT or notWhatever you do good luck.  The world of technology is a giant spaghetti highway of different ways to go.  ,InformationTechnology,cvw82md,1,t5_2sg67

The deeper you go the more differences youll find. Key database features are things like referential integrity journaling transactions a more robust API accessibility over a network internal optimizations faster retrieval faster insertion etc user access controls support for locking and concurrent actions and ability to support much large datasets with a significant number of concurrent users effectively. DBs are also MUCH more customizable and MUCH better at protecting the data. Theres a lot more in a database than just the data youre trying to store.

I got tired of working as a receiver at a hot warehouse especially after having a degree. I went over my warehouse manager to HR and she introduced me to the Corporate IT Manager. I told her my story and she decided to give me a chance for a couple of months with my warehouse salary. I learned many things including Citrix AS and the Network map that they have going on here. Now I got promoted officially to IT Administrator.
