470907,0,t3_1zhf3u,A Song for You  The intro especially stood out and it really hooked me in. The background has a nice sound. However the production isnt great crackling sounds not blending when they should. Overall I think this sounds pretty good!Some Girls Too  Basically the same thing. Good intro. Some not great sounds. Some odd lyrics haha.,independentmusic,cftslei,1,t5_2wlwg

2962707,0,t1_co4vats,Thank you for very much for watching and for your feedback! an minute bass solo is certainly not a very digestible format. I did it because it was really fun for me and it came about naturally. although its definitely not something I expect everyone to enjoy.,independentmusic,co4vhw8,1,t5_2wlwg
