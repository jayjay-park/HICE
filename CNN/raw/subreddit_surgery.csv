1010796,0,t1_chj6bxl,This is a salvage procedure.  Its not meant to get people back to running.  Its meant to get them to perform activities of daily living without excruciating pain.  The longevity of the implant itself is difficult to determine.  These tend to be replaced not because they wore out but because the other parts of the knee developed arthritis necessitating a total knee arthroplasty.  If that were to happen this easily pops off and the TKA can be performed with much difficulty.  In selected patients the pain relief is significant.  Its important to understand that this is not a firstline procedure most of the time.  This is reserved for people who have tried other operative interventions but have failed them.  Im beginning to move this up on my list of what to offer patients with significant patellofemoral disease.Age over  and Grade IV chondromalacia that has failed nonoperative management.  Or age less than  who has failed cartilage restoration and realignment procedures.So far so good though.  knocks on wood,surgery,chj6o8q,2,t5_2qkep

6262921,0,t3_40bqem,Have you talked to your docs about Neurostimulators or Drug Pumps.Neurostimulators provide pain relief by sending electrical pulses to an area near your spine to block pain.Drug Pumps deliver pain medication to the spinal cord instead of the blood stream. You can use a very small dose without other side effects.Ive spent way too much time in Physical Therapy and have some great friends who I meet there.  I havent done either personally but have seen the difference in relief they provide. I wish you the best and realize you are looking for non surgical relief.  For me controlled breathing and focusing on something else helps but realize that doesnt work for everyone. ,surgery,cz1iw50,1,t5_2qkep

Its all a matter of priorities.As a resident with a family my main priority was getting home to see my kids and wife so I would just go running at night after the kids were in bed.  Lifting would have been much harder  youll probably have to find a  hour gym if you want to lift consistently.

10943041,0,t3_5wadro,In general staples are used when there is an increased likelihood of a wound getting infected such as contamination with stool in a bowel operation. That way if it does get infected you can take out a few staples and allow the infection to drain. Staples can only be used on the skin.Sutures can be used on deep tissue as well as skin. You can do layers of sutures if a wound is under tension. Generally you can get a more cosmetic appearance with a sutured closure.,surgery,de8p493,10,t5_2qkep
