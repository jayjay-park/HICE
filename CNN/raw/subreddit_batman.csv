You could literally spend hours listing everything that is deeply wrong with BampR. Like what you like but it shouldnt be hard to understand why people dislike Batman amp Robin especially. As far as Forever is concerned really the only thing wrong with it is Tommy Lee Jones attempting to be Nic Cage in every scene.

255680,0,t1_cf78txl,That would be an amazing suit because they always change Batmans costume. Supermans general design doesnt change too much Man of Steel was the biggest film change yet! But Batman hasnt had a comic book accurate costume in any theatrical movie other than Mask of the Phantasm which was animated anyway. Its always either black rubber black armor or.. KILMERCLOOENY BAT NIPPLES. Why cant Batman just be a ninja detective genius who developed a material that is like cloth but bulletproof? Thats the least unbelievable thing in the established lore already! I hate it when people say Superman and invincible alien who can fly and has heat visor and is vulnerable to the atmosphere of a fake planet is more believable than a genius billionaire developing a special kind of clothe. I cant wait to see the new Batsuit and based on Kevin Smiths reaction its at least not all black and has some comic book qualities. And I heard Superman himself is getting a redesign for his suit I hope that they add some actually vibrant colors. Do you think Lex will be bald in this film and do you think theyll go after a BatmanWonder Woman relationship or a SupermanWonder Woman relationship?

Scarecrow might be able to bring Batmans biggest fears out dead center in his mind but they both cant beat the Jokers detirmination. Joker doesnt care who Batman is or does want to know anyway but him and Batman have came out of the same way by tragedy. Joker just wants him and Batman fighting forever until one just gives up which will never happen on account of Batmans detirmination or the Jokers insanity.

278598,0,t3_1x8jg8,Mr. Freeze or Victor Fries. I love him as a villain because he is a very human character. He devotes his efforts and resources to finding the cure for his wife. What could be more human than doing whatever is necessary to save the one you love. His story or at least the one popularized by the animated series is just touching to me. Heartache is a powerful thing. All Batman villains are great though. Many of them are examples of what Bruce Wayne could have been but Bruce used his personal loss and pain to become something else in order to prevent the same from happening to others. Many of the villains turned into something else trying to avenge their pains and losses. Either way its arguable that both Bruce Wayne and these villains transformed into monsters. ,batman,cf9n0u7,4,t5_2qqt8

The only differences are that it replaced the blue parts with black and replaced the underwear on the outside of the suit. I love that the took out the underwear I dont hate the underwear but I think the suit looks so much better without it it looks more like a suit rather than a costume to me. I also really like the black since blue can often stand out more than black.

569372,0,t1_cg4zaan,Yes but comic fans put an emphasis on look over story. This is why comic fans love Zack Snyder because despite his major lack of storytelling abilities his movies look amazing. I bet his Batman will look amazing but I would much prefer a good movie with good story over him looking like the comic.       You can make huge assumptions about what fans can understand but the idea that a human being can dodge bullets and defeat a god has to be told in a way people understand. And being just that good isnt acceptable.         ,batman,cg4zqy4,2,t5_2qqt8

580567,0,t1_cg64c4i,gt Detective abilities are not a measure of intelligence. Being a great detective means that you have great crime solving and although one does not go hand in hand with the other deductive reasoning skills. It does not make you the worlds smartest person.You are repeating your position not providing evidence or an explanation.  Denied.gt When he plays a major role in formulating attacks and has saved the world numerous times it does make you a master strategist.Go to the dictionary and look up strategy and tactics.  The two are distinctly different.  Cap may be a decent tactician but so far you have not shown any evidence that he is even a mediocre strategist.gt You do realize when the super soldier made him the peak of human perfection it wasnt just physical right? His capabilities for intelligence were majorly expanded by it too.If so he doesnt use them which is just sad.  You have not shown any example of him being all that smart.gt Id say that Cap and Bats are equals in that Cap is at the peak of human perfection where Bats is trained in more fighting styles.You are blind and insane.  Its completely the opposite.  You have stopped even providing arguments or evidence  instead you repeat your position over and over not saying anything new.My guess is that you are a Cap fanboy and associate your selfworth with that of Cap instead of looking at the situation objectively.  As such you take any perceived criticism on Cap as an attack on yourself and either lash out or react negatively in a different way.Also look up cognitive dissonance.  Then go look in the mirror.

The go to excuse is hes too powerful but while Batmans draw is that theoretically anyone can be him for a long time now its been very popular to say that Batman can win any fight ever against anyone simply because hes Batman and prep time is code for autowin no matter how strong or intelligent his opponent is.    I think its more of the way people think of Aquaman.

733103,0,t3_22jz1d,Its hard to recommend stuff to a Batman fan  they come from all walks of life. Some grew up with the Animated Series some grew up with Burtons Batman as their personal standard others didnt get into it until Nolans films etc. Ill recommend other stuff that I enjoy and attempt to list reasons as to why I feel someone that likes Batman may like it.First if youve enjoyed Snyders work in the Batman world Id check out some of his other stuff Severed A rural horror story set in  that follows a young boys journey to find his father by stowing away on trains. Heres what a review said that hit it spot on without ruining any plot points instead of focusing on cheap scares and tasteless gore Snyder and Tuft have made psychological horror the books most prominent trait. American Vampire Considered by some to be Snyders best work. I love the tone of this book. Heres what Wikipedia has to say The series imagines vampires as a population made up of many different secret species and charts moments of vampire evolution and interspecies conflict throughout history. I feel this one is a good series if you enjoyed The Black Mirror. The Walking Dead The TV show is pretty enjoyable though it does have its share of writing and pacing issues. The makeup effects are well done the actors are great and there are some very tense moments that make for great viewing. However Id recommend starting with the comics. The first  issues can be found in the first compendium for . The characters are well written and diverse with most of the plot driven by the characters. Id recommend this to any horror or comic fan not just a Batman fan. The Stand by Stephen King My favorite novel comparable only to It. Basically a virus wipes out  of the population and the story follows the survivors attempting to rebuild a semblance of society. This is King at his best. The characters are well written and really drive the plot along. If you can start with the original although the Uncut Edition is great the original offers a better introduction IMO. If you dont care to read a  page novel it was recently adopted into graphic novel format. Theres  volumes or an omnibus. The artwork is beautiful and stays  true to the source material.  Locke amp Key I feel everyone should read this. Its graphic novel series written by Joe Hill Stephen Kings son. Without giving too much away a family moves into a house and begin to find keys scattered throughout it. When the keys are used to open a door interesting things happen. It is a perfect blend of horror fantasy and great story telling. The plot is tightly woven the art is great and theres some genuinely creepy moments.Those are my top  recommendations. If you have any questions or would like some more suggestions feel free to ask!,batman,cgnlw1n,1,t5_2qqt8

And I get the son thing I consider all of them his children and he has cared more for Grayson and Todd than Damian anyways. The reason he didnt try to get help is because he is sick.  Bringing him back to life changed him a lot some of his mind is gone most of that was the pit and super punchnot in film but it can also just be blamed on natural human reaction if I thought my father let the person go who hurt me I would ve been short to forgive.  In fact in many issues Bruce actually gets him mental help and they do kind of come to terms. But Bruces biggest mistake the death of a son will always stick with him.

Hes a person idyllic maybe but real none the less with strength and weakness and success and tragedy. I like to think its that combination between our childlike wonder and mature respect that makes him so enduring for us and is something I wanted to try and capture in this image.,batman,ch52o37,1,t5_2qqt8

But in canon Batman has been outriched outrun outkungfufought outpunched outkicked outprettymucheverythinged but he has never really been outsmarted. Thats sort of his thing.  I take no issue with that. Wolverines got claws Iron Mans got a suit and Batmans got the wits. Its all good.  The issue I have with it is sometimes the pointless escalation. Its like a room of  smart people.  First one says  My IQ is measured to be .  Second guy  Impressive though mine is measured at .  And then in the good Batman stories Batman the third guy says  Mine is . Lets work togetherThus I have foiled your plans.  But in the ones that are just annoying Batman doesnt say that. He says  Mine measured on a scale specially designed with the unique set of skills that put me in this very room. On this scale your combined intellects would barely register so I have let you to believe that your IQ is what brought you here lulling you into a false sense of security. But here we use my scale. And on that scale I am the one who is the smartest. Im am the man who is the bat!  Its a bit much really.

No one else seems to have it though and everyone is saying its probably fake.I doubt it even exists Kevin Smith is working on like  movies right now aside from his dozen podcasts each week.

1725957,0,t1_cjwpk7d,I meant more in general that batman trusts alfred. Not necessarily in this context. Reason being that Alfred was practically Bruces father Dick had Bruces exact originsparents murdered by thug and was Bruces practical son and obviously bruce trusts himself. In regards to this context BatgirlStephanie? and Tim probably were just too young to trust them with such a crazy important secret and Jason was probably too much of a loose cannonnot exclusively loyal to Bruce for him to trust.

1781153,0,t3_2ew0kx, I honestly think he uses it as a boomerang a shuriken and many other things. If anything I think Batman has became more ingenuitive throughout time with his gadgets.  He never really started using his grapple gun until his earlier missions with Tim Drake too. Before that he had to use skill to throw it everywhere. Also Batman had to use raw detective work early on and now  and on we are ok with letting him use gadgets that are practically a  years ahead of normal people. Which why not? He has traveled all over the world all over space time limbo  and even other dimensions entirely on more than one occasion. In some comics he used a batarang with sonar to map out caves and other places he uses it for many other things too I just cant think of them at the moment. I hope I explained something....its still early. ,batman,ck3o2kx,3,t5_2qqt8

The movie bombed with critics though and Batman and Robin only did worse.  While Forever is considered the lesser of evils both are pointed to as killing the franchise.It doesnt matter if you want to put all of the blame on Batman and Robin though.

Traditions for numbering of article  Ten Commandments sfw gtDifferent religious traditions divide the seventeen verses of Exodus  and their parallels at Deuteronomy  into ten commandments or sayings in different ways shown in the table below. Some suggest that the number ten is a choice to aid memorization rather than a matter of theology.   This position is difficult to support inasmuch as the bible offers distinct contents for The Ten Commandments in Exodus and Deuteronomy and a set with  members is not automatically easier to memorize than sets of other or smaller sizes.gtInteresting Sicilian Mafia | Ten Commandments song | The Ten Commandments  film | Catholic doctrine regarding the Ten Commandments Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcljding oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecljding.

2477281,0,t3_2nvqqh,No way. Bats is his muse his straight man and his audience and in Jokers mind the only one who really understands whats so funny about this world. Im just thinking out loud but in a way I think that once Joker realised Batman had a limit to what hed do Joker imposed the same limit on himself towards Batman and he understood that to be the one golden rule of their game. The only win is a psychological victory and to completely break the other from the crazy persona that circumstance had moulded them into. Simple killing the other while they still retain their conviction and values makes you the loser.The only way I could see it would be if Joker planned on following straight after as a triumphant punchline ala Under the Red Hood.Fuck I forgot how much I love Batman.,batman,cmhx1ps,4,t5_2qqt8

2520454,0,t3_2oimcm,I liked that both suits were used practically and that their weaknesses are exploited. There are really well composed comic book moments in Batman Begins with the original. The stairwell descent surrounded by bats for instance is spectacular looking. The same goes for the opening of Dark Knight in the parking garage brawl and Scarecrow pursuit. The Dark Knight suit shines best during Laus kidnapping and the Japanese skyscraper jump. The cape looks better in my opinion on the second design as well as the cowl obviously. That said it suffers visually in TDKRises during the daylight scenes. It would have been cool if Batman returned from the pit to Gotham and modified the original suit with Lucius into an improvised DKR version. They could have padded the armor made a helmet and installed his joint enhancement bands all over the place.I guess Ill get my fix for Batman power armor in . Im happy with what leaked in the comiccon trailer and hope to see more in the upcoming teaser. If it was an extended and polished HD version of that conteaser that would be pretty great. ,batman,cmnk838,12,t5_2qqt8

And how fortunate we are that it does not occur to him. Its not about who would win in a fight. Superman would crush Batman. Even in DKR he only fought him off long enough to fake his own death while it looked like he was winning. And he had to have kryptonite the green arrow a nuclear blast a citys power grid and a superman who didnt even want to hurt him to do it. The point isnt winning the point is ideology and what each character stands for. Theres a reason they get called Worlds Finest. Theyre the best. Is batman cooler? Hell yeah.

3025944,0,t1_cobbj5c,I have to disagree with you slightly on both points...Heath Ledgers role was unique... He took the madness and exploded with it... He had plenty of fun with the role even if it lacked all the usual whimsical humor of the Joker you could see he derived his own deep and sick pleasure from everything he did and he showed it brilliantly and I dont think it would be easy for many actors to have played the Joker in such a way as Ledger did.Jacks role however was closer to the original comic book Joker whimsical and devious even if much less insane than he couldve been. I feel like this role could have easily been filled by many actors as he didnt really make it unique to him. As I rewatch the movies I feel that Jack Nicholson did well hes a great actor but he didnt make me see the Joker in a new and exciting light in fact I felt that he needed a little bit more depth... Whereas when I watch TDK every scene with the Joker inspired all of the feelings that came along with comic book Joker but in a terrifying and exciting new persona even if he dialed down the whimsy of the jokers humor.As far as Batman I liked Michael Keaton too. Christian Bale is a great actor and definitely did a great job as Batman but I didnt see him filling the Bruce Wayne role as well as someone else might have. That being said Im thinkinghoping Affleck will be the best. Hes got the grittiness of Batman hes got the stature hes got the potential to pull off a great Bruce Wayne and I think hes the closest to the Comic Book renditions as we have ever come.,batman,cobmx9g,3,t5_2qqt8

3414309,0,t1_cphg33x,I think it would have been pulled regardless but a bunch of death threats helped that out. This cover is offensive for a bunch of reasons. Ill bring up three.. The book is for a younger audience. Im glad you think thats cool to show younger readers something so awful but in the interest of DC... not so much. They screwed up on a big level. They are bush league next to MARVEL now with good reason if they cant figure out what their presentation is to the point where buttons like this are being pressed.. Rape is not the first thing to come to your mind because you read the Killing Joke wrong. Getting shot in a super hero comic is not something that scars you for life. Physically? Sure. It put her in a wheelchair. But just like Jason Todd in Under the Hood it was something deeper and psychological that made Killing Joke the terrible moment for Babs. Todd felt betrayed by Batman in that Joker was allowed to live after Jason was murdered. For Babs the look of horror in her eyes when she told Batman about what the Joker had done was not because of the shooting. The horror in Gordons eyes was also not because of the shooting. The main thing Joker does thats evil in the book is not shooting her. Thats why the cover is not about him shooting her. Are you becoming a little clearer now? The comics rarely mention the sexual assault but this cover definitely does. Its a callback to that which again is the central act of evil committed in the book. Its the point at which Joker goes from killer clown to something entirely different and decidedly worse. Its the point where he truly becomes the villain.. Women deserve a place in comic readership. That carries with it a responsibility that comic creators and comic fans need to tend to. Namely we cant fridge female characters anymore  Killing Joke is a masterpiece but only because Bolland amp Moore made it so. They took it seriously. They made it come to life. Im disappointed Moore hates it now. I think its a stellar story and amounts to tremendous risks with many established characters including Babs and Joker especially that work. The thing is that not everybody who touches on the events of this story is that talented. And if they arent then she is being fridged. Shes being maimed depowered and reduced to a plot device because thats what girl characters have always gotten in comics. Thats a terrible trope in comics and if women want to read comics then it has to go. Nobody disputes Killing Joke but if you handle that stuff badly you are going to burn progress down to the ground. And women will be right to hate comics.,batman,cphgf7m,-7,t5_2qqt8

3599945,0,t3_31l6n5,Yeah according to Scott Lobdell who was writing Teen Titans at the time Tim was Robin in every way but name. Out of respect for the recently deceased Jason he took the name Red Robin and kept it throughout. They hadnt really decided that for sure before starting the New  so there was a bit of miscommunication or selfretcon or whatever. I dont know why they had to be so specific like that... but whatever. If I had to suggest New  Red Robin stories the only one I can personally suggest Batman Eternal. It isnt exactly a Tim focused story but the whole Batfamily has arcs in it and Tim is written very well in it. Ive read some of Lobdells Teen Titans and its garbage. Im not sure how good Teen Titans has been since the new writer took over.Before the New  Red Robin had a short lived solo series from  written by Christopher Yost and then Fabian Nicieza. Its pretty great. Before that is your standard Tim Drake reading. He had his on solo series called Robin from . I cant personally speak for its quality.,batman,cq2mbkj,2,t5_2qqt8

Having said that in these games the norm is more challenges unlock the deeper you play into the game and Ive only played the first few hours darn adult life.  But Id still bet no since HQs story pack has a big  complete tag next to it and she plays louder than Batman since she makes a lot of noise during all her takedowns. As I guessed before release all the preorder bonuses like this wouldnt be worth the extreme fuss people made over it. The main game is meaty enough anyways. ,batman,csgyyeu,1,t5_2qqt8

4446898,1,t3_3c0olq,I know this topic has been run into the ground on this sub but I still havent heard a convincing case for why Batman shouldnt have white eyes in the movies. Eyes are the window to the soul and It allows the actor to express emotion are usually the argument and while youre not wrong about that were talking about Batman here. The dude is supposed to be mysterious he doesnt want you to know what hes thinking or feeling thats a huge part of his appeal. I would argue that dehumanizing the Batman is what helps make him the fearinducing mythical creature of the night that he is. When Batmans under the cowl his emotional range can be pretty limited and thats fine. Also this is a look that has existed in the comics for  years now. Like it or not the white eyes are a huge part of the Batman look. Im so glad were getting proper white triangular eyes in the mechsuit but I do wish we had them in his normal cape amp cowl. I just dont see any reason that it shouldnt work.rant,batman,csr7uau,1,t5_2qqt8

Im  sure there are plenty of people mad about it too.Anyway its interesting that you keep bringing up Batwoman since Batwoman wasnt originally written as a lesbian but actually as a love interest of Bruce Wayne.But they changed an established character.I dont see any issue with exploring new ways of approaching or portraying existing characters. Its done all the time and it leads to interesting stories. The stories and characters get stale otherwise. But make the change to race or gender or sexuality and everyone loses their minds.In any case this is just a what if type of idea Im proposing. Theres plenty of similar threads that pop up in this sub. Why should it be okay to entertain other what if scenarios but reject if the scenario involves a change to sexuality.

Shes physically capable educated and has had many adventures on her own and with other characters showing her to be a valid threat to Batman while still being a decent person for a criminal. Her sexuality also was usually linked to her innocence and cuteness which making her more sexualized removes. Why boil that down to something so shallow?

So yes the detective comics have always been a batman thing!A little fun fact is that the creators of the New  for the detective comics along with a few other of the batman series realized that the age of kids asking their parents for money to go buy a comic is over kids these days will just play the games and watch the movies. With that being said they knew a majority of readers would be an older group including lifelong batman fans.

Example Making Harley fall in love with him. But to do this he has to play different roles. You never know what he plans and even if you know that he only plays with your mind youll fall for him.

Thats why the military and police use them. But technically they only have one weapon their mouth. They arent like lion they have no claws. They dont out weight you either. They cant out climb you.They can only outrun you and bite. This may be terrifying but not actually all that effective unless they get the drop on you. Our natural fear of growling angry animals is what makes attack dogs so effective. We see one and our first instinct is to run away. Running just so happens to also be their best attribute so you allow them the advantage.They teach soldiers how to handle attack dogs because the enemy in Iraq liked to use them to guard militia compounds. Stand your ground time your attack guard yourself and hit hard. Put the dog down before it sinks its teeth into flesh.,batman,cuagjlj,5,t5_2qqt8

5344416,0,t1_cvusy2w,It shows the two characters stepping back from their usual roles. Its not Joker escapes mad plan foiled goes back to Asylum Joker escapes again its Batman trying to help Joker only to realise that theyve both gone too far now and it will only end with them killing each other. Some people see the fact that the laughter ends and Batman grabs J as Batman snapping his neck but I dont believe that mainly because the script doesnt mention it he grabs his shoulders not neck and the rest of the book is incontinuity but its an interesting thought.Batman and the Joker just spend one moment outside of their dangerous little game to laugh with each other before the police come. ,batman,cvut4qj,4,t5_2qqt8

I feel people only like him cuz he kills like how people like the Punisher. And now that hes kind of like a hero just kills it for me. I dunno thats just me but imo I dont feel its as good as people say. And I dont care what people say John Dimaggio Bender Jake the dog voicing Joker was lackluster.

As someone who was totally in love with Batman Begins I was kind of disappointed with the following two movies. Begins had this perfect moody darkness to it. It was so cinematic and Batman was presented perfectly. They really made me believe that people could be terrified of a man in a costume who can take out whole rooms of people like a ninja. And TDK just dropped all of that. He didnt do anything stealthy. They dropped the entire fear motif.  He doesnt appear behind people hunched over in the shadows as his cape billows around him. They just kinda stopped all the moody dramaticness and he became a guy who fights well and walks around in a cape. Anyway rant over. I just rewatched Begins and it reminded me how it was the perfect batman movie.,batman,czjdtpp,1,t5_2qqt8

6538778,0,t1_czvmmkx,Similar motivations but not the same. Frank Castle had an adult life he had a family Bruce lost his parents as a child. In that way Bruce Wayne was allowed to grow into Batman. He has relationships and a life though they are stunted and strange. Frank Castle essentially died with his family. The Punisher isnt a person. He has no friends or relationships. Both are isolated but unlike Batman I dont think the Punisher is lonely. I dont think it ever occurs to him that he might let someone in. So the difference isnt in motivation or method but in the actual substance of the characters. The separation between Batman the criminals he would kill would be their reasons for killing and the people being killed. The criminals kill innocents for gain. Batman would do it to protect those innocents from the criminals. The two are not moral equivalents. One is selfish and done to undeserving targets while the other is selfless and done to deserving targets. And heroes in every medium and genre kill all the time. Batman and Superman are the only ones the question of the line come up for. The question is also a slippery slope fallacy. But to answer it anyway the line goes where it reasonably does. Lethal force is applied to foes who demonstrate lethal intent. Otherwise you end up with a system where those who do evil are valued and protected above their victims. Because they will continue to kill no matter what. And every time that persons life is preserved is the guarantee that they will go on to kill more. And that sort of person simply isnt worth the price of their victims.,batman,czvnvft,1,t5_2qqt8

6900636,0,t3_4a9f2v,So read the main volumes in order as you would.Night of Owls I would read after City of Owls. Itll fill in whats happening with the other Batfamily members during the events of City but its not necessary for you to understand City. However there is an issue of Detective Comics in Night of Owls that shows Batman and the events at Arkham Asylum. Not necessary to understanding the whole narrative but there will be a jump in City of Owls and thats why.Id suggest the same for the Zero Year tiein collection and read it after youve read the two main Zero Year volumes. I havent read that one myself but I believe its the same and theres nothing major you need in it to understand the Batman volumes.With Endgame The Joker volume actually has all of the Batman issues plus more so its a more complete volume. However the Batman volume is better paced in terms of story. Its up to you whether you want to read the Batman volume first and then go back and fill in the supplemental stuff with the Joker volume or just get the complete story from the beginning.Also let me suggest getting Batman Eternal. Its really good and it takes place between Death of the Family and Endgame. It had multiple writers on it but Snyder was one of the big creative forces behind it.,batman,d0yi7pu,2,t5_2qqt8

7085658,0,t3_4cm73s,I believe Keven Smith has mentioned that Affleck is a particularly big fan of Batman The Animated Series. His portrayal of Batman in Batman v Superman certainly leads me to think this is true. Heres hoping that he can channel his love for that version of the character into his own scripts. While I think theres always room for fresh ideas and growth Ill politely say that I think some of Snyders decisions took the character back a couple of steps in the direction of the Burton films that may not have been the best choice. ,batman,d1jiyg0,28,t5_2qqt8

Any drama or character conflict can come from their relationship and Bruce keeping the fact that Dick was meant to be a Talon a secret from him.

7178196,0,t1_d1tlsuc,Well just look at the DC history for the past  years or so batman begins dark knight rises man of steel bvsdoj. Which of them would you define as fun? They are superhero movies that take themselves seriously but thats because the themes in the film are in fact serious and pretty sinister when you look at them. Now take marvel age of ultron antman guardians iron man  all have jokes and they are light hearted it works for them and I respect that fully but when I dont want that I go to DC as I know what to expect and I didnt come away dissapointed. Sure this film wasnt for everyone but it excites me to see whats coming next and did a damn good job of getting me to that point. What exactly is it trying to be? Well no not really firstly he hit the car not the guy on the machine gun or the driver car flipped and thats one. The guy with the flamethrower he shot the gas canister not the guy and it blew up. None of the bullets actually hit anybody so with that in mind it technically is a cause and effect of his actions and its not new to batman  ras begins Harvey knight talia  driver rises so I dont get why everyone is on there high horse regarding it. Its a change same with superman its what is nessasary to save the people they protect. Sorry I should of been more specific I actually really really enjoyed the film loved how it was done and embraced the change but its such a breath of fresh air to see something with a bit more depth than weve had recently. Thats not a stab at the marvel franchise at all just I dont rate their films as highly as I once did spiderman  iron man  since then I dont think theyve had a film thats really pulled me in as much as the dark knight did only because I think it brought new light and depth to the superhero movies. Winter soldier was the closest and a fucking good job they did with that film. Kinda threw it out of the window with age of ultron and a number of plotholes and stories left unfinished for the sake of an avengers film and having fully read civil war I think its gonna be a shame that they cant base it on the novel as that had depth. Ive seen the avengers fight its nothing new nobody substantial will die quicksilver meh thats what excites me about batman v superman and the DC roster theyve opened the gates to these new characters when the marvel characters are established and weve seen them in action nothing new dude. ,batman,d1u3gp7,3,t5_2qqt8

7181799,0,t1_d1ufcin,How many shovels have you gone through digging your grave?You clearly dont understand just fine. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE WITHOUT READING THE COMICS. Its NOT THAT COMPLICATED. I know plenty of people who would fit the under the umbrella of general audiences. They had absolutely no problem following what happened in the film and understanding what was going on. And last i checked millions and millions of people didnt have a problem following this. Sure there are a good number of people who didnt like this film but stop pulling numbers out of your asshole. Please provide proof if youre going to be that bold. Though yet again you dont know how intelligent banter works.There you going again definitely saying that its a bad film. Oh Lord Horkenlad please bless me with your devine knowledge of all that is good and bad. I understand that you didnt like it and that you think its bad but that doesnt make it objectively bad. Ive covered this so many times already. Here its worse though because you say  just because i dont like it doesnt make it a bad film and then go on to say Its a bad film because its horribly made. Stop pretending like you know what makes an objectively good film buddy because lets be honest here anyone whos read your comments could tell that you know next to nothing about basic storytelling let alone story structure and character building. Stop talking as if you could do better. These guys wouldnt have you on set to shine their shoes. You may not have liked parts about this movie and honestly at this point i really dont give a shit but for the th time just because you didnt like those things doesnt mean its an objectively bad film. Until you make a movie which i hope to GOD you never do stop pretending as if you know how to better make a film. And hell at least try to back up a single thing that you say man youre embarrassing yourself....On a side note i actually love talking comic books with people! I also love talking movies with people. Could recommend some fantastic IMO comic runs and films and i could explain competently why i like them. However judging by the way youve handled this conversation i wouldnt want to talk to you about the weather on any given day. You were condescending from the minute you called me son so you got what you deserved.Now please PLEASE move along. Like i said i prefer intelligent conversation with people who understand how talking works. Especially when it comes to comics i prefer conversations with people who actually understand these characters.Woe to all of the comic books that have seen those eyes of yours.

7224595,0,t3_4edkj8,I agree. I think also of how killing is portrayed in these movies so far. I agree that with the entrance of Superman this Batman did have to come to grips on some real shit. He even makes the argument to Alfred about this being Batman for  years was mounting to. This was this unseen pressure hed been dealing with for decades. Now it comes down to being one of the most powerful in the room. Not blur the lines here but is it asking too much to go back to With great power comes great responsibility? That was the final straw in MoS. He realized Zod was not going to stop until he killed everyone. Batman sees Superman and has to measure himself welp there goes that ideal. Its always the last straw the very last measure. I am also excluding the Knightmare sequence. I feel like you cant really judge that until we know what went wrong there. But even Luthors people he killed I mean he had to get the kryptonite before Luthor could. Yes he still made it weapon intending to kill Superman but I agree with OP where he realized something about himself with Save Martha. To me that was a powerful moment of acting man you saw Bens face completely reflect chaotically. No this Batman has inspired me to think and create new darker more brutal Batman. While I love Batman the Human my heart is with Batman the Spectre. ,batman,d1zds5g,7,t5_2qqt8

7235775,0,t1_d20n30d,If we want to be charitable then any human figure performing an action intended to harm or disable another COULD be called martial arts. Im of the mind set that if you cant find a person who can do it for real then its not in the realm of existence and thusly not really martial arts. Damn. I cant refute your statement in any way youre right. Although I did know the guys he way hitting were on wires I thought you meant Batman was when you originally said wire work. Also I thought the way he moved wasnt necessarily realistic but he did move like Batman in my opinion. I always felt like Batmans speed in certain situations is what made him seem not entirely human. Dude! You mentioned that scene at the end of Rises. I fucking love that scene and if anything that scene makes the movie easier to watch because I know its coming. Its also one of the best fight scenes that Ive ever witnessed. Ive been on both ends of that in a fight. I know the fear in Banes eyes as he realizes none of his punches will connect and I know the feeling of victory in Batmans ability to watch his opponent and wait for the perfect chance to end the fight. That sequence was exhilarating for me yet most people didnt think much of it. Damn man. You gave me goosebumps. And no offense taken. I dont know the things you do and with your knowledge you have not only a different view point but also different reasons to appreciate the fighting sequences. I have to respect that and I do.

7273992,0,t3_4eiubz,I think he understands both. The difference is that to most people Superman is the Christopher Reeve Superman in his ideals and power level not the  John Byrne Superman. The complaints about Superman feeling conflicted and moody seem to come from people unfamiliar with the past  years of Superman comics and definitely not from people whove been reading the New  version of the character.I also see people talk about AllStar Superman a lot. AllStar Superman is a direct throwback to the Silver Age an homage purposefully done. The idea that Snyder HAD to draw on that version of Superman is absurd.Honestly Batman has been reinterpreted on film three times before Burton Schumacher Nolan. Audiences are more accepting of change with Batman.This is the first real reinterpretation of Superman weve seen on film. The Brandon Routh Superman was just a continuation of the Christopher Reeve version.Whatever third interpretation eventually happens in  years or whatever no matter what it is will not be met with this level of criticism revolving simply around the tone of the character.,batman,d2505xl,1,t5_2qqt8

This is why I dont get why people get so angry or when people complain about rehashing Moores work or making movies of it and shit I get wanting it to be done right as a HUGE Moore fan... BUT Moore didnt come up with Jack the Ripper the main cast of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Chutulhu all the Charlton characters Watchmen are based on of course he did great things with them but he didnt get any of those original creators blessings either. So one could argue that Moore is creatively bankrupt basing most of his successes on previously created loreproperties. To be clear I personally think his writing is bad ass. My point being end of the day EVERYTHINGS derivative especially in mainstream superhero comics. Itll either be cool or itll suck. The creators just gotta keep trying new ideas.

And even if you werent talking about an actual rabid dog but one that has been deemed inherently violent and a safety risk its still different. You cant reason or treat a dog. You can with a human. Humans also have enumerated rights that dogs dont have.,batman,d5dd9re,3,t5_2qqt8
8286570,0,t1_d5d3zim,Some would say that this event turned him into Batman and did kill the young Bruce Wayne.And this is Batman vs Superman this is hard to write. With all the writers we had in comic books the only way to do this has been to have it be in a elseword or have the clearly not being themselves. They had to do it in the most  canon  way and I think they did a good use of Batman. Played on how he is a  safety freak  how he is a symbol of fear almost demon and his obsession with the death of his parents to create good conflictAnd about the killing well its not like he killed himself  except for Superman that didnt happened  he just didnt noticed it too focus on his mission.

8579867,0,t1_d6du7zi,I think to find Heaths Joker funny you have to have a dark sense of humor or get what he is pointing out as absurd or odd. He laughs when he mocks people by saying what he is doing without them realizing.He also makes a few references that are used in a context that is a mockery of the original source. Like You complete me! he is making the ying and yang analogy but that is something you say to someone you love with all your heart and soul and not someone you hate.He isnt trying to make you laugh but instead he is making himself laugh. He gets that you wont get the joke but he does and that is whats funny. He is having fun. His magic trick is an example of this. How about a magic trick?... Tadaa! He kills a guy and makes the pencil disappear. He could have killed him any number of ways but his magic trick was more fun for him.Another example is when Gordon talks to him before Bats comes in to talk to him. He asks for the time. Gordon questions that. He says Well depending on the time Dent could be in one place or several. He isnt saying that Dent is being moved around as anyone would assume from that. He is plainly stating how he is going to blow him up and when that happens is triggered by a timer. He is laughing at them because he just told them what his plan was and they dont know that and it is funny to him.He laughs at Bats hitting him because Bats could beat him to death and it would mean both Rachael and Dent die. You have nothing nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength. Bats has worked hard to be strong he is smart and nothing he can do with his brawn his brain and his gadgets can stop what Joker has done. That is hilarious to him how he has made Gothams strongest opponent to crime as weak and helpless as a child.He thinks he is sane and he thinks the world is insane. He isnt corny in his jokes like earlier ones were where the humor was obvious.His jokes require you to get inside his head and become a little insane and see his plan for the future to see the humor. The I want my phone call part is an example of that. He finds it funny that even he as bad as he has been still has the right to a phone call. He needed the phone call to further his plan and that is funny to him that he essentially has the right to trigger the bomb. When they dont comply and let him make his call he improvises and takes a hostage and his only demand to be met to free the cop? I just want my phone call. How he says it the tone the cadence it suddenly becomes reasonable where as before it was impossible to allow. He found it funny how that changed.The Ledger Jokers humor is finding being at ground zero on  funny because you crawled out of the rubble and said Does anyone see the quarter  expense reports? I have to get those upstairs before the end of the day or else Im out of a job. I just had them! Ok retrace your steps. I was at my desk I put them over here Becky screamed the building collapsed. Oh here they are! Its ok everybody I found them!While everybody else is in shock panicking or trying to help people you are having fun making light of it all by looking for paperwork that is entirely irrelevant in the circumstances and that makes everybody look at you like you have lost your fucking mind. You may very well have lost you mind in making a mockery of that tragedy but you are laughing at the insanity of the world around you.That is why Ledgers Joker is funny you laugh at him laughing at how insane the world is.,batman,d6e2gtx,8,t5_2qqt8

Its this odd sense of realism that they try to bring but just bring the wrong parts. It kinda ruins it for me.I mean I get it. Batman is jaded after years of fighting crime in Gotham and not really seeing a difference and now there are bigger and badder threats that threaten the world. But a fucking car used as a wrecking ball.I understand that golden age Batman killed people but it was a last resort kind of thing. Afflecks Batman does it all willy nilly. And thats not Afflecks fault thats whoever wrote this Batman. I have faith that Affleck and Johns can make a great Batman movie. They just need Kiss from a Rose.EDIT And I understand this Batman is based off TDKRs Batman but Batman killed one maybe two people.

8855886,0,t1_d7byjon,gtI do not understand why that game was so panned by critics and players.Ill keep my biases out of this as even though I did enjoy it Ill probably never play it again or include it in a future playthrough of the trilogy.It is the lesser of the bunch for many reasons. What would help the game immensely is removing Arkham from its name. It should have been a standalone title even if they did use Rocksteadys code. Deathstroke had Robins animations from Arkham Citys DLC with Ras Al Ghuls boss fight mechanics theres no defending that especially when he was the poster villain. Very sloppy. The game design was awful. Ive mentioned this before on this sub but they gave you shock gauntlets to punch through every enemy no matter if they had a shield or shock baton etc. They gave you equipment that was too OPredundant.  Also the cheap ice bomb replacement with glue is just lazy. Gotham was barren and boring. The game was buggy as fuck. On release you literally couldnt do some missions until weeks later because they took so long fixing it. The PC porters Iron Galaxy were allowed to do Arkham Knights port too fuck knows how It added nothing new except a story unlike City that expanded greatly on Asylum in gameplay environments and characters and Knight that expanded greatly on City mainly in terms of the environments and a long awaited batmobile with its own mechanics The inconsistencies with the other Arkham games are almost as if they didnt care. Art StyleTimeLineCharactersVoice ActorsPlot Joker being Black Mask was just silly and AGAIN cheap. As Clayface played Joker all throughout AC so they just rehashed ANOTHER thing from City.

9088468,0,t1_d849ft4,I disagree about the Holmes route being not his stylegtBill Finger recalled that Robin was an outgrowth of a conversation I had with Bob. As I said Batman was a combination of Douglas Fairbanks and Sherlock Holmes. Holmes had his Watson. The thing that bothered me was that Batman didnt have anyone to talk to and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking. I found that as I went along Batman needed a Watson to talk to. Thats how Robin came to be. Bob called me over and said he was going to put a boy in the strip to identify with Batman. I thought it was a great idea.Although I think most of my criticisms of The Dark Knight could also apply to Guy Ritchies Holmes who uses deduction like twice in the first movie both featured in the trailer and not at all in the second.And youre totally right about Riddler.  Hes one of my favorite fictional characters in theory but Ive never seen or read a story that really does what the character should be justice.  Before the third Dark Knight movie I fervently hoped that Riddler would be the villain instead of Bane.  I had an idea that Riddler is a cyber criminal a hacker who manages to hijacktake down Gothams stock exchange.  With the first two movies focusing on a physical existential threat to Gotham the third could focus on an immaterial existential threat forcing Batman to actually think.  The riddles too could be embedded in the hacks nothing as silly and directly riddley as the Jim Carrey ones but more like Moriarty in Sherlock when he leaves a pair of shoes in the middle of the room or produces a fake painting implied riddles instead of explicit ones.,batman,d84acjf,1,t5_2qqt8

I dont have mic stands yet so we are just holding them for the time being. Other guests have been better about this so far. I do actually provide links to the scripts and do have an episode  that explains all of this. This episode out of context does make it a little confusing. I will be posting two episodes a week a mini episode on mondays detailing what the movie is going to be and where you can get the script and then the episodes launch on monday are the ones where we actually discuss the script like you listened to so I give the listener almost week to read the script before the episode comes out. A hint to you is that tumblr is already up and the second episode script is already listed so you can get a sneak peak at the next episode www.shelvedfilmpodcast.tumblr.com. I am trying to nail down a structure but the hope is people will have read the script that I provide and it will be easier to follow along because I dont want it to become a rigid show I do like a little freeform conversation. The third episode is a lot better with trying to follow the plot of the screenplay. Thanks for the feedback its super useful.

In my head canon Batman hasnt seen Joker since he killed Jason which is when Batman sort of gave up and started killing so when we see Joker and Batman interact I think it will take everything Batman has not to kill him and Joker will do his very best to try and push him over the edge,batman,ddzle33,5,t5_2qqt8

11333246,0,t1_dfgll91,I think that this solitary moment made the Batman amp Robin review the first truly classic Nostalgia Critic episode.  Doug Walker has expressed numerous times his disappointment with the episode as a whole feeling that the Critic wasnt yet an adequately refined character.  I personally feel that even if some of the other gags werent as good they built up perfectly to the bat credit card moment.In case you havent seen it the Critic and Linkara finally drew a line under this running gag last year,batman,dfglqz1,11,t5_2qqt8

11358071,0,t3_623axc,In terms of Bruces early Batman career then definitely Year One by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli but The Man Who Falls by Dennis ONeil and Dick Giordano is a shorter issue length story that specifically explores Bruces training in good depth. Think that might be exactly up your street.Also the animated film Mask of the Phantasm has some great early career moments  including trying the suit on for the first time.

11447900,0,t1_dftavwi,Yeah Ill explain the guy two comments above me posted an image of the Batmobile from the famous  comic The Dark Knight Returns. The next guy said he now feels the need to revisit the animated film based on this comic. I told him to just read the comic because its so much more detailed.  When the Waynes die in BvS its taken directly from this version. Like almost every detail of that scene comes straight out of The Dark Knight Returns down to the look on the murderers face. Its brilliantly done and the animated version just ditches all of that detail.,batman,dftlyg9,1,t5_2qqt8

11493053,0,t1_dfyiyfs,To add to this I dont like how ignorantuninformed theyve made BruceBatman in the DCMU. The events of Man of Steel should not be the first time he finds out about metahumans and he definitely should not be getting his info on them from Amanda Waller. He should already know everything she does. Im also not big on Batman being the one to bring the team together. In every iteration I remember Batman is always super hesitant to join. That being said Batfleck was the best part of BvS for me.,batman,dfyqiwk,2,t5_2qqt8

11665740,0,t1_dgh6hxw,Completely agree with this. Its far easier for someone to make an interesting comic book story and stick to these kind of rules because the suspension of disbelief is higher in that format.In a movie however were up against the idea that here in front of us is a man an actor in a suit. What is he going to do without any super powers? What can he do when the bad guys are obviously aiming to kill. I dont think that Batman is the kind of guy who would choose to kill recklessly but I absolutely think that hes the kind of guy that would kill if he had to. Hell he may even feel bad about it afterwards but hed do it in a heartbeat if it was the only way.,batman,dgibrvm,3,t5_2qqt8

11665993,0,t1_dgickqp,Ill agree with you on that ya. The fight scenes in TDK trilogy were obviously a huge step up from the Burton and Schumacher films but they still felt robotic at times especially in Batman Begins. In Batman Vs Superman and what little we saw of him in Suicide Squad he looks like Batman during the fights.I dont have high hopes for the Justice League movie but the scenes with Batman that theyve shown look just as amazing.,batman,dgict26,2,t5_2qqt8

11687043,0,t3_66llvm,In my spare time I have been writing one for fun. Batman really deserves a T.V. show that fully fleshes out the Batman mythoscharacters villains.  hour long movies every  years dont do any justice. It would be a show that would highlight his career  episodes long each season. My pilot would show him traveling the world training and with the episode ending with him arriving back in Gotham. Season  would take influence from Zero YearYear One The Man Who Laughs. Ideally I would like it to be a dark gritty show focusing on his detective skills. ,batman,dgkqsg8,7,t5_2qqt8

11753384,0,t1_dgs9jps,I think he was the Best Bruce Wayne but that Batman voice kills it for me. All I hear is Cartman now ... thanks South Park. On looks alone I think Val was the closest look to Bruce until we got Bale. I never liked Kilmer otherwise as Batman though he just looked the part. I think Bales Batman is possibly the worst thing about the new movies but his Bruce might be the best thing as stupid as that might sound but also there isnt a lot wrong with them IMO either. I love pretty much every Batman movie that isnt Batman amp Robin honestly. ,batman,dgs9xit,4,t5_2qqt8
11792666,0,t1_dgwli51,I remember never hearing anyone say the word kill. It was always replaced with destroy. Made for lots of awkward dialogue since a lot was obviously changed after it was written. ,batman,dgwqlg1,7,t5_2qqt8
