150880,0,t1_cevk55l, The structured cable going through the building is very expensive to replace if there is any damage to it.  Patching allows you to repeatedly disconnect a port and move them around over the years and still expect the structured cable to remain serviceable. It allows you to stay organized even when cables are repurposed abandoned for a while reused etc. It provides a means to test the cable vs the port during diagnosis. It does in fact help with organization and labeling.,cableporn,cevm742,10,t5_2s9v2

1472690,0,t1_cj0tcbg,When you make steel you generally want it made into some specific shape continuous cast involves pouring liquid steel into a mold usually a few stories above the ground and letting gravity pull it down. This way molten steel is constantly being poured at the top and at the bottom the steel has a hot but solid shell while in the middle the steel is still liquid albeit cooler. In this fashion you are continuously casting without having to stop any process. The entire time the newly formed steel slab is moving away from the point of origin as more steel is poured into the mold.,cableporn,cj0vko6,2,t5_2s9v2
1499467,0,t1_cj3yuss,These are umbilical cables for subsea wellheads. They began designing these umbilical cables in  and the first prototype was constructed at Scanrope. This facility had the technology to put the final outer jacket on the cable.These umbilical cables were part of Norwegian Hydros Troll Oil development plan in the North Sea. The prototype was finalized as a product named Troll Oil Steel Umbilical and the production was later moved to Alabama USA. Concept artwork Here are some cross sections of various umbilical cables over the years Some interesting reading on the application of these umbilical cables on the King Field in the Gulf of Mexico gt Apart from low and highvoltage electrical power the umbilical also provides oil for the pump lubrication chemicals for injection to prohibit the formation of hydrates and fibreoptic communications. The part that looks like a giant RCA connector is probably a steel cone that holds electronics buffers signal converters amplifiers valves whatever needed to splice weld together each section of cable. Im no expert but this would be my educated guess as an exelectromechanic.In the background I think you can see a platform module being constructed. The neighbouring shipyard built a lot of really huge platform modules back then. Im unsure if these two projects are related.EDIT after looking at the the photo some more I think it might be a huge crane and perhaps not a platform module after all thats part of the barge the cable is positioned on.,cableporn,cj48df1,11,t5_2s9v2

2153263,0,t1_cldj1av,ampampampSection . Applications of article  Neon lamp sfw gtgtSmall neon lamps are most widely used as indicators in electronic equipment and appliances due to their low power consumption long life and ability to operate off mains power. Larger lamps are used in neon signage Most small neon indicatorsized lamps such as the common NE break down at between  and  voltsgtThe breakdown feature of neon lamps allows them to be used as very simple voltage regulators or overvoltage protection devices. In the s General Electric GE Signalite and other firms made special extrastable neon lamps for electronic uses.gtLike other gas discharge lamps  the neon bulb has negative resistance its voltage falls with increasing current after the bulb reaches its breakdown voltage.    Therefore the bulb has hysteresis its turnoff extinction voltage is lower than its turnon breakdown voltage.  This allows it to be used as an active switching element. Neon bulbs were used to make relaxation oscillator circuits    for low frequency applications such as flashing warning lights stroboscopes  tone generators in electronic organs  and as time bases and deflection oscillators in early cathode ray oscilloscopes  Neon bulbs can also be bistable and were even used to build digital logic circuits such as logic gates flipflop binary memories and digital counters   At least some of these lamps had a glow concentrated into a small spot on the cathode which made them unsuited to use as indicators. These were sometimes called circuitcomponent lamps the other variety being indicators. A variant of the NE type lamp the NE had three parallel wires in a plane instead of the usual two. It was also intended primarily to be a circuit component.gtNeon lamps have been historically used as microwave and millimeterwave detectors plasma diodes or GDDs Glow Discharge Detectors up to about GHz or so and in such service were said to exhibit comparable sensitivity of the order of a few s to perhaps  microvolts to the familiar Ntype catwhiskercontacted silicon diodes once ubiquitous in microwave equipment. More recently it has been found that these lamps work well as detectors even at submillimeter terahertz frequencies and they have been successfully used as pixels in several experimental imaging arrays at these wavelengths.gtIn these applications the lamps are operated either in starvation mode to reduce lampcurrent noise or in normal glow discharge mode some literature references their use as detectors of radiation up into the optical regime when operated in abnormal glow mode. Coupling of microwaves into the plasma may be in free space in waveguide by means of a parabolic concentrator e.g. Winston cone or via capacitive means via a loop or dipole antenna mounted directly to the lamp.gtIn s radio sets neon lamps were used as tuning indicators called tuneons and would give a brighter glow as the station was tuned in correctly. Because of their comparatively fast response time in the early development of television neon lamps were used as the light source in many mechanicalscan TV displays.gtAlthough most of these applications use ordinary offtheshelf dualelectrode lamps in one case it was found that special  or more electrode lamps with the extra electrode acting as the coupling antenna provided even better results lower noise and higher sensitivity. This discovery received an application patent Kopeika et al.gtNeon lamps with several shaped electrodes were used as alphanumerical displays known as Nixie tubes These have since been replaced by other display devices such as light emitting diodes vacuum fluorescent displays and liquid crystal displays Novelty glow lamps with shaped electrodes such as flowers and leaves often coated with phosphors have been made for artistic purposes. In some of these the glow that surrounds an electrode is part of the design.gtNeon indicator lamps are normally orange and are frequently used with a coloured filter over them to improve contrast and change their colour to red or a redder orange or less often green.gtThey can also be filled with argon krypton or xenon rather than neon or mixed with it. While the electrical operating characteristics remain similar the lamps which? light with a bluish glow including some ultraviolet rather than neons characteristic reddishorange glow. Ultraviolet radiation then can be used to excite a phosphor coating inside of the bulb and provide a wide range of various colors including white.  A mixture of neon and krypton can be used for green glow but nevertheless green neon lamps are more commonly phosphorbased.gtSince at least the s argon neon and phosphored glow thyratron latching indicators which would light up upon an impulse on their starter electrode and extinguish only after their anode voltage was cut were available for example as selfdisplaying shift registers in largeformat crawlingtext dotmatrix displays  or combined in a x fourcolor phosphoredthyratron matrix as a stackable color RGBA pixel for large video graphics arrays. gtMultiplecathode andor anode glow thyratrons called Dekatrons could count forwards and backwards while their count state was visible as a glow on one of the numbered cathodes.

2242814,0,t1_clowg9s,I do a lot of network cabling Im always paranoid about drilling or cutting into electrical work hidden in walls though Ive managed to avoid it with a little guesswork about how the electrical was run. Actually Ive only had one close call I was drilling through a block wall and hit the back of a metal junction box anchored to the other side. I have noticed a lot of greenfield being used in new construction here. Now that I think about it I dont remember the last time Ive seen electrical not run through metal conduit of some sort. ,cableporn,clowxtu,3,t5_2s9v2
2245729,0,t1_clowte9,Also a lot of TVs are made to stream TV signals not computer signals. The chips that run them have a latency of a few milliseconds. Enough to have a noticeable lag when moving the mouse. Hook your computer up to a big screen TV and see what im talking about. My friend had a  tv that i thought it would be fun to play starcraft on. Turns out the lag was bad enough i couldnt accurately select my units when they were moving. Another time i hooked my computer up to a  LCD TV. the lag was manageable for normal tasks but i was unable to play any kind of first person shooter because of the latency.,cableporn,clpa9sn,2,t5_2s9v2

We dont have any use for a bunch of cat or e because we dont sell prebuilt and connected racks. Well probably sell the power units that are in there as standalone items and send the copper to scrap.  We only get paid by the pound for scrap though and most of it is just motherboards bad hard drives ram empty towers or rack chassis which brings the price per pound down quite a bit compared to the price per pound for copper.

2453515,0,t1_cmewy03,gtThis allows for better coolingIt depends on the equipment. Especially with power amps. If they have active cooling then some are designed to be racked on top of each other with no space. Ex crown Macrotech. They bring in air from the front and blow out the sides. If space is left between it will cause turbulent air in the rack and actually reduce cooling. By racking with no spaces all the amps can actually work together. Thats not to say that the QSC amps pictured work that way. Just a fun fact and a reminder that when dealing with power amps always check the manufacturer specs. ,cableporn,cmeyha9,3,t5_2s9v2

It isnt difficult at all and the actual fusion part is completely automated when using a modern fusion splicer.
