487243,0,t3_1zgixd,You can get scrypt asics for roughly  a piece if you know the right place to look.  They hash at roughly  Khs and consume only  watts on average.  Compare this to a R x at  Khs  watts  roughly  and I wouldnt call it an all out win for the asic.  Where it will make a difference is the power consumption but I dont think this is the death of GPU scrypt mining at least until prices go down with other competing asics launching.Even so I think with scrypt coin falling other coins that use momentum keccak sha and multialgo will rise up and keep your GPU humming.,wafflepool,cfvniv4,1,t5_2zray
496599,0,t3_1zt5u3,The profits are a market issue. See PoolPicker.eu for a comparison of pools.We are nearing overload on the servers which has been causing minor instability but not likely affecting profits. PoolWaffle is spinning up additional servers as we speak,wafflepool,cfwptkf,6,t5_2zray
