848889,0,t1_ch0rpvt,Open carry IS NOT legal in NYS. There is no provision in the law that allows it. If you are up in bumfuck watertown or the Adirondacks there are towns so remote that no one bugs you during hunting season if your pistol is out and about. However most of NYS is not bumfuck northern NY. My pistol permit instructor even said NOT to open carry on your own property if your house is within view of other houses. Why take the risk of having the jackbooted thugs of the NYSP showing up and arresting you or confiscating your pistol?  You have to be EXTRA careful now since the unSAFE act allows for warrantless search of your home and seizure of ALL firearms if you are arrested for a firearms related offense. TLDR DO NOT OPEN CARRY be careful cover your ass FUAC.,NYguns,ch0rtyi,2,t5_31goy

1436976,0,t1_ciw6zrz,There is some confusion about that. Most NYS licenses are valid in the entire state but NYC is its own entity with home rule. According to PP you need a hunting endorsement to take it outside of NYC borders say to shoot it at a range on LI or in Westchester but even that is a grey area.NYC is a premise only license unless you are a celebrity or powerful figure and have a SPECIAL CARRY license whereas the rest of the state generally issues carry licenses in accordance with Penal Code Section  and then tries to administratively restrict them.If you try to leave NYC to goto a state you have a nonres CCW or dont require a CCW with you could potentially be in a world of trouble because you technically cannot leave your premises with the handgun unless you are going to the range.Its a really backwards ass state where the inmates are running the asylum. The whole Sullivan Act needs to be repealed.,NYguns,ciwegmt,1,t5_31goy

7585738,0,t1_d34fqef,For the longest time its just been the fact that the counties wouldnt allow it. But being a property owner in NY  but not a resident and applying for a permit has been valid for some time. Now its a matter of getting counties to start agreements like this and really open it up. ,NYguns,d34gmaq,3,t5_31goy
7896724,0,t3_4ne4ib,Theres no way around the ridiculously long and expensive NYC licensing process.  Its basically designed to discourage everyone and squeeze money out of those who are willing to part with it.  The good news is that it works they do issue the permits but it took me a year and a grand.  If youre in Manhattan you can check out West Side,NYguns,d43nyci,1,t5_31goy

10098577,0,t3_5kbrdv,Still waiting here for someone to answer the holster question rather than the tint issue that has been a law for years and no one follows no cop cares about unless your a dick and the town needs the  and isnt a fellony so... chill people.From what my instructor told me. It can be in your cup holder as long its covered. It can be in a bag as long as the lid is closed not zipped it can be tucked in between the seat and console but cannot be in direct line of sight of anyone at any point at any time. He said he does that in his truck with it holstered he tucks it holster and all between the seats of the bench in his pickup with just the grip in reach then puts a rag over it. Id just assume if you had doors off no tints shit an invisable car that if someone can tell its a gun that its considered a brandished firearm. I dont think the holsters illegal but i wouldnt leave it in there if you get pulled over. Id get it in your glove box ricky tick if you see those lights in your rear view.,NYguns,dbnuxf4,1,t5_31goy
