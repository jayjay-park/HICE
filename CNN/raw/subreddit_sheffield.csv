2487815,0,t1_cmj8a9a,Mmm. There is certainly a divide in Sheffield. I often think that those on the west side often seem quite sheltered. The most deprived parts of the city are in the old industrial areas beyond the east. However there is rarely any need to venture into these areas and so it largely goes ignored. Not that Im accusing anyone of ignorance but I think it would do the city some good if more people became aware of inequalities that lie within our boundaries and to be more pro active in resolving this problem. ,sheffield,cmjank2,8,t5_2rab3
2607055,0,t1_cmyruh3,Im inclined to agree with you. I quite enjoyed it but more as a way of idly killing a few hours than anything else! It wasnt a great film and unlike the LOTR I probably wont bother buying the trilogy itll be on Netflix anyway. I would imagine that some clever editing of all three could transform it into a more poignant tale which was always my interpretation of the book  it was never meant to be a LOTR equivalent in my mind. Then if they want to go crazy they could dramatize the Silmarilion properly and wed have a pretty awesome epic of the Second Age of Middle Earth! Lets hope Star Wars delivers...,sheffield,cmyvoaz,1,t5_2rab3
