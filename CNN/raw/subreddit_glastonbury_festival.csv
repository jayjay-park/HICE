If you miss out on that then around May time a few hundred extra tickets have been on sale in previous years for literally a  minute window  if you set up a page monitor and are very quick with your details then you could get another one then. Best to plan for the resaleor volunteer for a charity like Oxfam.,glastonbury_festival,ckziprc,1,t5_2shm6

6869256,0,t3_47rpmb,Avoid cheap supermarket tent unless your happy really rough it out if it fails. They are pretty weak structured all it takes is someone taking a bad trip over your guy lines and its done with. Go outdoors or Decathlon are good places to get tents and other gear Quechua tents from Decathlon are really good and are not too expensive. Also take the time to set up your tent properly guy lines and all. The rain can get pretty heavy and a saggy tent can quickly end up looking like a pond liner.Personally i much prefer walking boots and gaiters over wellies. You will be doing lots of walking so comfort is very important. Dont forget gaiters if your going down the walking boot route. Gaiters  Walking Boots  Happy feet whatever the weather.As for the rain i wear a decent waterproof coat that is light enough to easily put in my backpack once the sun comes out again light waterproof pants and my boots and gaiters as previously mentioned. Alternatively if your planning on getting really fucked up you can get away with wearing whatever you want as many people do. I prefer to stay dry and comfortable either way.,glastonbury_festival,d0uxw6c,1,t5_2shm6

7453634,0,t1_d2onltr,Great answer.As mentioned if it were me Id aim for the western car parks as it will be a lot easier to get to where youll probably camp. Parking a mile from PGC on the east then having to get across to where therell be space will be a nightmare and would negate any advantage youll get from driving over training it.If you do want to get into the western car parks and youre coming from the east then remember there are road closures so plan a route to skirt round well in advance and then come in as though you were travelling from the west.,glastonbury_festival,d2pfitk,1,t5_2shm6

9216693,0,t1_d8k9rw0,Its actually a group created to buy tickets together.They have built a webpage to organise it there are about  groups of up to five each each group nominates a card holder who takes all the deposits and adds their card details to the site. Everyone adds their details which are combined into a csv file that everyone then imports to the autofill extension. On the day you choose or are assigned to a group to help everyone tries to get tickets for their group as soon as someone in your group gets tickets for the group everyone is reassigned to the group with the least helpers so by the end there was over  people trying to get tickets for the last group. Everything is logged for security and boasting purposes its a very very good system. I had nothing to do with the setup of it and dont even need a ticket myself but Im very impressed with how well it worked. ,glastonbury_festival,d8ka8f9,4,t5_2shm6
