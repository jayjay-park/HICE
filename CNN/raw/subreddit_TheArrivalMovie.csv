However its weird we didnt see any other gifts.. also all of the different countries were experiencing different rates of progress yet when Louise prevented the war and her job was done all of the vessels left once potentially leaving before other sites figured out their gifts and how to use them. Suggesting unification was the only gift and Louise secured it first? And  will become one was quite and accurate translation on the chinsese side. ,TheArrivalMovie,d9vnesk,2,t5_3fwre

If they were time travelers coming back from Earth  years in the future they would already have evolved and had at least the start of a civilization on Earth right now. They dont so they cant be from Earth they must be from space. I was only mentioning the core concept of alien because you were asking multiple questions.  So are they alien?  Yes.  Are they from Earth? No.,TheArrivalMovie,ddsxh68,2,t5_3fwre
