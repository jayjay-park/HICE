10652967,0,t3_5gyks3,I actually had a very similar experience last summer during the height of the Pokmon go craze. This strange little girllittle as in physically small not young lached onto my room mate and I after he invited her into our apartment to take shelter from a rain storm. We always joke around that she was a vampire but part of me wants to believe it. ,vampires,dderse5,1,t5_2ql0l

11709406,0,t1_dgn3icv,Hi. When I watch a film on DVD I add a photo of the DVD which I consider fair use. If I watch a film at the cinema or on TV then I have no photo to add and I do not want to take some film poster from the internet because you never know what the copyright issue is like with these things....,vampires,dgnahbu,1,t5_2ql0l
