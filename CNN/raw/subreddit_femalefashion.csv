814831,0,t3_23g4hh,I would be really interested in a findfashion type thread whereas I dont really think theres much need for SQat least not if the questions are truly simple maybe a General Questions thread though? Ive always assumed that readers of this subreddit are a proper subset of readers of FFA I could be very wrong here... so whatever gets posted to SQ in FFA will eventually be read by everyone kind of like how I dont really understand the purpose of General Discussions in this sub....For posts in FFAs findfashion otoh its hard to discern whether someone is looking to invest how i loathe that word or would be satisfied with any mallbrand suggestions that meet given criteria or even worse whatever labelitem happens to be hyped at the time. Sometimes you can tell by their budget but its not always known whether this is a hard limit or whether theyre willing to wait for something thats good better? but pricier to go on sale...Also would be great to leverage this subs knowledge of designersboutiques etc.Id be fine if findfashion gets rolled up with another multiple other threads but dont think it should get rolled up with SQ because their scope is completely different. I think it would make more sense to combine w threads where users post about specific pieces of clothing like keepreturn or possibly a new should I shouldnt I buy thread?,femalefashion,cgwwekz,4,t5_2v01d

3303866,0,t3_2xzi3l,Honestly my personal wardrobe is a huge mix of brands. I dont really buy into the idea that if you buy a piece you have to cleave to the designers intentalthough I will buy things because I like a designers aesthetic. I think brand synergy matters more of you are going for a really specific look? Like uchadniks rural english schoolteacher style for instance probably benefits more from this than my does this work with black skinny jeans style. And traditionally the most cited examples of brand synergy would be the black and drapey designers like Ann D Rick old skool HL Damir Doma. That said part of what I like about fashion is to see how things are styled in lookbooks and runways and then seeing how people absorb different pieces into their own personal aesthetic.,femalefashion,cp4v8eg,5,t5_2v01d
