The time it takes to see the fees doesnt matter either because what other option do you have?Yeah keep excusing this shit until theres even less option to buy these things.And again why is Louis CK able to fight these scumbags.  Why is he fighting them in the first place by selling his own tickets if none of this was a problem?And it doesnt take  seconds to figure it out.  The full fees only appear when youre all the way at the end of the checkout process after their site locates your tickets after you enter all your info.  Do you always get to the very last step of the checkout to budget your ticket spending?  Or do you look at the face then figure in something reasonable for fees?I have seen a handling fee.  But this is the first time Ive seen two.,BillBurr,dcy4feq,1,t5_2trqi
