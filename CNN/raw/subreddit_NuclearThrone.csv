3313529,0,t3_2y3pqr,Its up to you to decide whether or not mutations accentuate a characters strengths or make them redundant. Sometimes its fun to create character builds that excel at some aspect of the game to absurd levels  I dont think theres any right answer to that! It also depends on the circumstances. Some examples off the top of my head... In your case it may depend on your weapon build. Melee Eyes doesnt really want Plutonium Hunger since hes mostly going to be within TK range of pickups. But if youre using ranged weapons or have a Rush Crown the double assurance of picking up pickups can be helpful. Rabbit Paw Open Mind Lucky Shot and Recycle Gland in some combination can lead to more ammo than you know what to do with as Fish if you dont have ammohungry weapons. But add in Back Muscle and you have a build that wants to take ammohungry weapons. Its similar with Rhino Skin and Crystal. If you have Rabbit Paw Second Stomach or Bloodlust you may find yourself capping at  in the early stages and want a buffer that you can extend to  for the later stages. Plant can run ridiculously fast with Extra Feet to the point that running becomes defensively viable. Good grief Extra Feet on Plant has saved me against a pouncing dog. Chicken and Eyes both have actives that help dodge bullets but neither one makes bulletdodging reliable in most circumstances Chicken still moves and clears bullets at regular speed without Throne Butt and Eyes cant reliably push bullets away without Throne Butt. Euphoria can make bullets noticeably easier to avoid with those two. Y.V. Stress and strong nonautomatic weapons. Fun abounds.,NuclearThrone,cp5yxy0,3,t5_2yrck

If you combine it with scarier face the enemy essentially has  less health which is simply incredible for bosses.Meltings Throne Butt is amazing because its so much fun. In some situations you can get a chain reaction that will take out every enemy on the screen which is just way too fun to give up. Also blood explosions destroy projectiles which can be really really useful especially on Big Dog.Heres another question Id like to see what people think about What are the worst Throne Butts?Id say its Fish and Crystal and I dont imagine many people disagree.,NuclearThrone,csi1rzv,1,t5_2yrck

I can give you a million suggestions but if you just play and watch other better players play Nuclear Throne you will get better in every aspect.But I can still suggest... You have  health and  bullet usually does  damage. This means even if you are full health you can die by  bullets. So play safe and always dodge incoming bullets. Most of the monsters have touch damage and they also sometimes explode upon dying. So dont really use melee weapons if you are not comfortable close combat and always try to keep your distance. One of my mistakes was being greedy going in just to grab that ammo or xp. If you are like me try to get Plutonium Hunger this mutations grabs ammoxphealth for you in higher distances and therefore you dont have to suicide.PS I looped for the first time when I was  hours in to the game some in  hours.

But imagine if you had an extra slot to attribute something else to maybe your pew pew weapon isnt a melee but you still want to keep it for the range and dps then you can have lets say a jackhammer in your rd slot.

Having a gameover timer tied to the entire duration of the run simply doesnt work and the additional time provided for loops doesnt change much since youre dealing with hundreds more enemies with increased health as well as damage sponge bosses every underworld level.Heres some suggestionsgt Passive Every   d seconds  minutes  difficulty seconds one point of damage maybe two? is dealt to the player. This timer is reset upon clearing a subarea X X etc. This timer is paused upon killing everything onstage so that you dont get damaged from scouring the stage after everythings dead.gt Additional Passive Reward players that dont take any damage via timer with free ammo at the end of every stage.Tie the timer to a persubarea basis make it deal minor damage rather than major and increase it by a small amount as you progress. Reward players for playing fast punish them for being slow but dont outright kill them for it unless theyre seriously dragging their feet. gt ActiveI dont care much for the active you chose but it would functionally be better if applied to this updated version of the Passive. gt Thronebutt Reduce the time cost for the Active ability. SelfExplanatorygt Ultra A Better perks for the Active abilityBasically a buff to a buff.

10063807,0,t1_dbjbrlu,Sorry I misunderstood.I didnt get the badge until today so I would think that a recent score caused my win. None of my scores from the past month are the  score though. So unless it takes Thronebutt more than a month to add a win theres no way I got the badge from an actual win. I also think that if I was somehow able to get the top score from more than a month ago I would also notice it.Edit Also from checking the archives. I dont have any  scores between now and when I started playing around earlymid September .,NuclearThrone,dbjc696,2,t5_2yrck

10341139,0,t3_5o2bpo,Try picking up weapons and choosing mutations that you wouldnt normally choose and see how well they work there are some mutations that look bad from their tooltips but are actually good.Use cover as much as possible. If you see rads or ammo in an open area that looks dangerous dont go for unless you are sure of your dodging skills.Keep playing the game you may be surprised at how much better you get the more you practice.Dont get hit.,NuclearThrone,dcg86nt,2,t5_2yrck
10342018,0,t1_dcfp6uh,I bought it during winter sale. But I suppose the bundle price is pretty fair too considering you get other games as well.To be honest? Id buy it full price if I knew it has SO much content.The difficulty curve is adjusted in a way that basically anyone can beat the whole game the way he feels like.Main game difficulty isnt too hard but you can also challenge yourself and collect all gold or even do the secret challenges later on. both are optional as steam achievements almost dont touch them at allSo yeah if you enjoy platformers a lot I would highly recommend it.,NuclearThrone,dcgbro2,2,t5_2yrck
