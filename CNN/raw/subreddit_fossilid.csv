570758,0,t1_cg4o7oj,It is related both of the pieces you have shown are metallicsiliceous smelting biproducts slag which can be distinguished from natural materials by the flashcooling patterns on the lateral margins of both pieces as well as the bubblesvoids found throughout them. Therefore your obsidianlike piece is probably also slag but is higher in silica than either of the pieces in your photo so it will have a slower cooling time than the pieces with more metal in them. This difference leads to the difference in characteristics flow patterns and flashcooling patterns in the metallic pieces and microcrystallizationvitrification of the high silica piece. So they likely came from the same source i.e. railroad fill or mining support operations. As for basalt the geology of your area appears to be almost entirely Pennsylvanian sedimentary formations so its likely not any sort of a volcanic. ,fossilid,cg55ex6,4,t5_2s711

1200303,0,t1_ci411iu,Thank you uaelendel and thank you all for your input. Yes it is difficult to hear the resounding chorus refuting my speculation on this specimen. You have all been quite kind in your responses. This rock has accompanied me through a number of years as I have sought to find a way to introduce it to people who knew more than I. Rockhounding is a common past time on the Oregon coast and there are many pretty rocks to find there. My friends were collectors of the pretty rocks and that was as far as the thought process went. I was more of a casual observer rather than a collector. When this rock caught my attention I was not looking for anything in the rocks. But the explicit detail seemed to demand explanation. From that first notice of its character it only took about  minutes on the Internet of  to find what seemed to be a very specific answer. For  or  years now I have suspected that reddit would be one of the better forums to address. I was going to approach rpaleontology and then rfossilid started up. That was three years ago but it took me until yesterday to finally make up a presentation to submit. uaelendel I respect your admonitions and your call to action for me try and prove myself wrong. But in this case I never really felt that I had to prove myself right. The details I saw are so specific and explicit that they seemed to exclude any other options.So now as I ponder your last paragraph I realize I skipped a basic academic step in my pursuit. But I see no easy explanations for such detail definition and variation of structure in this rock.  ,fossilid,ci4nhy3,1,t5_2s711

1656593,0,t1_cjnx2pl,I dont see anything convincing one way or another.  You could be looking at some ordinary sedimentary layers or a legitimate cross section of part of a stromatolite.  To recognize stromatolites correctly sometimes requires an understanding of the context at the site and a specimen divorced from that becomes pretty hard to verify. The folded dark layer certainly looks like it could an algal mat structure of some kind some synsedimentary folding of the mat? but it could be inorganic softsediment deformation too.  Ironically debates about the biogenic or nonbiogenic nature of structures found in the Archean are pretty common and some famous supposed biogenic structures have been found to be nonbiogenic upon more careful study.  Its not easy.That being said your specimen looks like many others sold online from that locality so in that respect it looks legit.  And as a banded iron formation these units are often thought to have a biogenic component to them although thats debated too.The relevant unit is the Marra Mamba Iron Formation if you want to look up more details about it.,fossilid,cjnz69d,6,t5_2s711

2492529,0,t3_2o123x,In addition to all the anatomical and preservation issues the rule of thumb is that if a fossil is large intact and striking like that and not in a museum or sold for s at a respectable specialised venue its definitely a fake. Even if it is sold for s ... it can still be a fake. Wellpreserved intact fossils like that are extremely rare. For some dinosaurs and also  especially  homonids even top notch museums often use casts just because the original is extremely valuable and exists in one copy. the human origins exhibit at the Smithsonian had only one real homonid skeleton and it was behind some impressively thick glass and obviously sophisticated security!Personally I like the cheap imperfect bits of fossils more  they tell a story of their own sort eg. riddled with parasites or mineral partially replaced by another can fantasise about how it broke and the really nice stuff should be in museums anyway. Also smaller  cheaper on the moving bill.,fossilid,cmjwtln,1,t5_2s711

2886303,0,t1_cnw6azt,ampampampSection . Dentition of article  Woolly mammoth sfw gtWoolly mammoths had very long tusks which were more curved than those of modern elephants. The largest known male tusk is .m ft long and weighs kg lb but ..m ..ft and kg lb was a more typical size. Female tusks averaged at ..m ..ft and weighed kg lb. About a quarter of the length was inside the sockets. The tusks grew spirally in opposite directions from the base and continued in a curve until the tips pointed towards each other. In this way most of the weight would have been close to the skull and there would be less torque than with straight tusks. The tusks were usually asymmetrical and showed considerable variation with some tusks curving down instead of outwards and some being shorter due to breakage. Calves developed small milk tusks a few centimetres long at six months old which were replaced by permanent tusks a year later. Tusk growth continued throughout life but became slower as the animal reached adulthood. The tusks grew by .cm ..in each year. Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths with small or no tusks but it is unknown whether this reflected reality or was artistic license. Female Asian elephants have no tusks but there is no fossil evidence that any adult woolly mammoths lacked them. gtInteresting Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company | Mammoth | Deextinction | Current Nobody Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcnwbrb oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecnwbrb.

Pic  also suggests a profile incompatible with a vertebra or other bone.
