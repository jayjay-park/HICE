2286709,0,t3_2lao1i,I did  years of medsci physpharm before switching into nursing and personally loved the change. I was pretty sure after first year that nursing is where I wanted to be but I stuck it out a bit longer because I felt like I didnt know enough about the science program and had heard really good things about the upper years. I think it was a path that if I had left if unexplored I would always be really uncertain about my decision. After making the change I realize that nursing is a much better fit for me personally.That being said I really appreciate having a strong science background going into nursing. Its made a lot of the courses easier and I enjoy having that background when facing some of the more clinical situations.If you dont decide this year its also really good to keep in mind that there are a lot of compressed programs offered at Canadian universities so if you take a couple more years to make your decision you can apply for programs where you can get your BScN in  years instead of  because you already have some courses done.

3200685,0,t3_2wpoc9,. Not at all. Theres no guarantee but if you put essex as your top choice theres a good chance youll get in. I live in medsyd and Im so happy with that choice. Im in engineering and I wouldnt say that my work is interfered with at all. Everyone else here is trying to do well too so you wont have problems working on weekdays. If I need to study on a friday or saturday night I just head on down to the library in the building which is always quiet. Ontario hall is definitely the nicest looking building and plenty of people really prefer the suite style. From my personal experience the social atmosphere in a traditonal res like medsyd or saugeen is quite a bit better people keep their doors open and hang out as a floor more often and the res parties are a hell of a lot better. Also I hear the eng floor is great for working together but personally I think its nice to be able to meet people outside your faculty especially girls . Maintaining a  average is easy so youll need a much higher average than that to guarantee your top choice. I plan on going into software next year and with an average over  Im very confident of getting in. If youre rocking a  average in high school you shouldnt have any trouble getting in as long as you keep working hard in uni. For my sake I hope so!In terms of electives theres not really such a thing as a bird course. Especially since courses and professors change every year. My suggestion is to take something your interested in as youll do much better. I have a few friends taking film and they say its pretty easy. If thats your interest I say go for it!

For other programs its a toss up just my  cents.

10047122,0,t3_5jjn56,Hey OP it happens. First year is a time for learning about what works for you and what doesnt. I feel like weve all messed something up badly in our first year. You know how everyone says Math  is a bird course? I screwed it up so bad that I had to retake it that summer.First of all I would make an appointment to visit your professor in person but I wouldnt present it as being an appeal necessarily. Ask if you can go over your exam with them to see where you went wrong. And you need to genuinely look over it and realize your mistakes. Bring your notes with you. Then you can have a chat with the professor about how you found it difficult to study for it and maybe ask for a few suggestions. Make sure you relay your understanding to your professor when theyre explaining where you went wrong Oh so you just do x and then y? I see where I went wrong Be genuine.I would really advise against saying that youd do better in Calc . It comes across as you saying your lack of success in the course was because of the course itself rather than your own study habits or understanding of the material. They arent going to take too kindly to it. Other students can succeed in Calc  so you should be able to as well. If you say that you want to just take the easier route then it reflects poorly on you.Maybe at the end of your conversation with your professor you could say something like Do you feel that Id have any success if I appealed this? I wanted to get into this course and I missed the cutoff by . I feel that I have a better understanding of things now and understand where I went wrong. Your prof will give you their honest feedback or best case scenario might bump your grade up if its not too late because you took the time to come in and learn.However you do need to accept that you might just need to retake it. Retake it online if you must in the summer. Its no big deal. But I just feel that if you submit an appeal where you blame the course itself for your low grade they might react very badly to it. ,uwo,dbh5zbn,3,t5_2rm2m

10715942,0,t3_5t8ohz,Honestly Western is just another school. London sucks but if you live in the western bubble you will be fine. London may have   people but honestly its one big urban sprawl.  public transit  garbage I found the profs in psych were pretty good compared to the sciences they actually spoke english and gave a damn The staff can be hit or miss depending on the department As for connections im not sure. Compared to places like U of T or McGill its probably second rate. London doesnt have that many large and international companies so depending on where you work you may want to take that into consideration.  western is known for its medical sciences and Ivey not so much Psychology. To me based on what youre looking for you want the best of everything. Western is not the best. That being said wherever you go it all depends on what you make of it. Compare WesternLondon to places like U of T McGill UBC. Those places are in large cities with lots of international and reputable companies i.e. great connections the night life is a given and academically they are recognized world wide. With Western it can really be hit or miss. My advice is to actually come here and check out the citycampus for yourself. ,uwo,ddl9q9y,-6,t5_2rm2m

11517406,0,t3_64ebsh,Timeline of thoughts June of graduating year  Yes! I made it and now everything will be easy with this degree. Ill find a great job and really start living. September of graduating year What in the everliving  is wrong with me?  Why can I not get a career job?  Ive applied for at least  jobs that are related to my field and still no hits. Im working the same job I did as an undergrad.  December of graduating year  Got my first interview after applying for job . Didnt get the job. The anxiety is crippling and I might be depressed. Should I even bother applying anymore? Maybe I should get another degree or a diploma in something more jobrelated. My degree was basically a waste of time and money. All that debt for nothing.  months after graduation  I started applying beyond a  km radius of my desired city and have  interviews next week. The jobs arent exactly what I pictured I would be doing and are only indirectly related to my degree but Im capable of doing these jobs and really need a better job than what Im doing now. Ive started taking courses through Coursera and Lynda to gain skills in areas Im trying to move into. Looking for work is a fulltime job. months after graduation  Finally got a job  they hired me for my degree and my unrelated job experience doing that crappy job plus my independent studying that shows initiative. It is a  month contract to cover a maternity leave but the pay is good and it will get my foot in the door. months after graduation I switched to a different role in the same company after my contract ended and it came with a small bump to pay. It feels like Ive learned more in  months at this job than I did in  years of university. I actually put more than the minimum payment down on my student loan this month....... years after graduation  I wish I knew then what I know now.  I didnt hustle quickly enough after graduating and didnt lean on my network enough. My job search was too narrow and I avoided even applying for jobs that I was not perfectly matched to.  I didnt see my degree for what it was it built a rocket and launch pad trained me to fly and gave me all the tools to take off. But I still need to launch myself take risks and explore areas far outside my comfort zone.  If anyone asks me should I get a degree at university? I will want to answer incredulously damn right of course but not without the warning that a degree is what you make of it and does not automatically grant you a good job. Graduating is the easy part.,uwo,dg1hzq9,29,t5_2rm2m
