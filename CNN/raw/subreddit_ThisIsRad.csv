6386410,0,t3_434tqu,Here are some of my suggestions from the suggestion thread.South Park Heavy Metal  Henry Rollins everything from the music to the spoken word to the books BMovies Punk Rock Bowling wChris Hardwick Long Shot I know Guillermo del Toro similar to the Linklater episode Robert Rodriguez again similar to the Linklater episode Podcasts Scooby Doo. In terms of stuff not on suggestion thread Id love to see an Always Sunny episode and a Documentary episode and a food episode. From the list of other stuff that has been tweetedemailed Id be super into a Architecture episode and Power Rangers Kevin Smith and Synth episodes. I hope this is helpful Edit I thought of another Writing. It could be about writing scripts shorts poems short stories etc. Could be a fun idea. ,ThisIsRad,czfkgjg,3,t5_38vtq
7081607,0,t3_4cksmx,My weekly rads are  Mr Robot  Im halfway through the first season and Im loving it. Having a CS degree helps knowing what they are talking about  of the time.  Wrestling  This week is Wrestlemania week which it happening about  minutes from my house. Wrestlemania is Sunday which will be alright but the real good show for the week will be NXT Takeover Dallas. NXT is WWEs developmental show and has a mix of WWEs homegrown talent and a bunch of indie stars. Takeover Dallas has a stacked card with some pretty great build especially compared to Wrestlemania.,ThisIsRad,d1j2d2s,2,t5_38vtq
