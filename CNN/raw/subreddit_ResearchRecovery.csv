8613245,0,t1_d5hw9if,Im not quite sure if my chest pains are anxiety vaping php or a combination of all three...and maybe the constant masturbation.It tends to go away when I stop obsessing over it with cold on the chest or inhaling lots of steam...but sometimes it kicks in as soon as I start vaping it. Even when I mix it for vaping in a ecig at something like mgml which is at least  or so hits I start feeling the chest tightness immediately. My heart ryhthym is always the same and my BP generally around  and HR at  these usually only go up after intense sex or masturbation.I Realize its probably anxiety in fact Im almost positive but how  seriously should I be worried that its actually my heart and Im coming up with a shit ton of dissonance tinged truths to convince myself its not?Edit I have an assload of heart data from various apps if thats of interest,ResearchRecovery,d6i93u0,1,t5_3chgl
