4616212,0,t1_ctbn12t,Yes I did check CUinvolved last night. Thank you for letting me know that I was on the right track!I have started an anime club before as has my husband but I am doubtful I will have time available to fully commit to a hatchling club. Starting a club is not that hard  nor is requesting permissions  its the promotion and recruitment that takes large chunks of time.,Creighton,ctcgaqt,1,t5_2t2qw
