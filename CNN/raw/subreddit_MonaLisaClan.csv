11429173,1,t1_dfrgulq,her chest is probably the least iconic thing in the picture modifing it wouldnt collide with the original idea of painting just the mona lisa. and for me more interesting means collaborations or significant changes to normal logos or artworks on the canvas. some of the flags like the european cluster already   get modified and although i dont necessarily like that many flags i like their interactions with the surroundings. the great parts of the canvas are the parts were multiple groups cooperate. the mona lisa sur looks nice but at the moment thats allalso im not interested in fucking up something complicated im spending most of my pixels on fully automated luxury gay space communism.,MonaLisaClan,dfrhgd4,0,t5_3jt1k
