7820322,0,t3_4mfey1,Really impressive considering the trouble her and Moore found themselves coming off the corner. Architecture ran a screamer too. Both of them were well clear of the rest of the field!,HorseRacingUK,d3v2igw,1,t5_3auq8

9230969,0,t3_56omdm,I just feel like he rushes back from his injuries. He would be better hanging back for a few months and getting himself stronger. No luck you say? Don Cossack with beg to differ. Gold Cup winner at age of ? Nothing wrong with his luck ha. ,HorseRacingUK,d8m3cr5,1,t5_3auq8

9913463,0,t3_5hez9e, Doncaster  BET December Novices ChaseA small field make up this race with O O Seven the oddson favourite after his success at Cheltenham last month but this is too tough of a step up in class to merit a bet at Ladbrokes. This  means that Potters Legend is preferred after winning both starts over fences and having more experience over  miles in some strong hurdling events last season. A case could be made for Bay Of Freedom who has also looked strong in his so far short chasing career but hasnt quite ran this far and may prefer slightly softer ground.pts Potters Legend  Ladbrokes,HorseRacingUK,dazqxen,3,t5_3auq8
10326314,0,t3_5nrlds,Why did I choose the Lanzarote? Because Im a fucking madman thats why. You can make the case for at least half the field not that I will. But lets start by eliminating a fewLittle Boy Boru is on a big losing streak and lost by about l on the last two iterations of this Old Guard probably doesnt have the stamina Will Othe West needs a career best Local Show was pulled up last time out and while form isnt all that bad I wouldnt back him Templeross looked poor on handicap debut and for me Modus hasnt shown the right form at all.So where does that leave us? Basically all the singlefigure players. Which makes sense as the last  winners have all come at  or shorter. Interestingly the last  have all come from riders with a claim which draws me to Jaleo  with Paddy Power. Alex Ferguson claims a very handy lb and hes been riding well of late. Hes relatively unexposed seasonal debut looked needed despite the win! and Ferguson won on him in that effort too. Not a bad start. Jumping might be an issue though.Itd be remiss though not to cover a few more though. Ill go back to discounting a couple Chesterfield hasnt raced beyond m so Im going to somewhat warily discount on stamina and Sam Red basically fits no criteria wed be looking for. Now for some more marginal shouts Fountains Windfall is marginal for me and his  with Betfair looks tempting each way given hes open to improvement. Hmm. Lord of the Island fell last time out and hopefully isnt feeling worse for wear for it but could be progressive and was running well until the fall. At s though Im not overly enthused.Now the big boys.Lets look at Doesyourdogbite F at most bookies. Mine doesnt. Then again I dont have a dog. Im chatting shit.  from  over hurdles and the second of those was particularly interesting  hes definitely got more to come. One for the shortlist.Venetia Williams won this with Yala Enki last time out and looks to have a goodun again in Bennys King  PP who has come on quietly and got off the mark last time out. The handicapper hasnt quite got his number I feel.Kalondra has Richard Johnson on board and is  with most. Yes were up lbs and this is better company than for the win last time out but more can come.So Ive covered all the horses and can narrow down to four Doesyourdogbite Jaleo Bennys King and Kalondra. For me  and I know its always a bit unimaginative to say  but Im having .pts win on Doesyourdogbite  Bet BetVictor  elsewhere. He looked awesome on Boxing Day and really good in his other hurdles wins so hes very much the one to beat. Its marginal but there you have it.,HorseRacingUK,dcejmu5,2,t5_3auq8

11157064,0,t1_dew3alr,On form I totally agree that Limini cant beat Vroum Vroum Mag but surely something is amiss with Vroum Vroum Mag if Walsh is ditching her for Limini. Cant back a horse at that price if it looks likely to run way below her best.,HorseRacingUK,dewn3mk,1,t5_3auq8
