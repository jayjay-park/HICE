2341543,0,t1_cm121d5,gt are your sex sessions too long? They vary but she hates quickies. She prefers longer.gt Is POV too long? Not suregt are you touching her the way she likes? According to her yes. She states that if we start it is great. But just zero interest in starting. Resist it. gt are you turning her on mentally? This is a huge thing for her I have worked on over the years. Mental is the biggest thing for her. She is a passion person. All the physical wonder wont do jack if its not there so I try to make a point. Sane thing though. She backs off before it leads to sex. Favorite excuse is Im tired now. That we shouldnt have took do much time during foreplay and resists. If no foreplay she says shes too tired and not feeling it. Sex is mental for me even though I am HL. It is even more connected to my emotional needs to reinforce them. Sad I know.gtIt is not clear what you mean by going out of your way but sounds like it is not just about your sex life. How long have you been married?Married  yrs together . There is more involved but not LL related,LowLibidoCommunity,cm14l99,1,t5_33b1b
3285834,0,t1_cmjab5n,It might clarify things a bit to realize that sexuality isnt a static quality.  Its dynamic fluid and subject to change over time while you change and grow as a person.  When I was a young teenager I was convinced that I was gay.  I lusted after all of my friends male and while I felt some of the girls I liked were cute sometimes Id be hanging out with a guyfriend and just have this nighuncontrollable urge to kiss him and grab his crotch.  I still feel like that but rather than being attracted to men in general Im attracted to a man once in a while maybe  of every  or so acquaintances I make.  Meanwhile once girls I knew started getting hips and tits my attraction to women exploded.  This was probably at least in part to the fact that girls I knew were starting to resemble women rather than children but I definitely felt that some of the change happened in me.  I was a lot more attracted to girls emotionally and platonically as well.People change.  With time our passions change our interests change and our priorities change.  A few years ago a major motivation in my life was to pick up move to an entirely new part of the country and hammer out a new career for myself.  After having done that for a bit and approaching  I have an overwhelming desire for a house I own a dog a nice used car and . children.  Life is change.  Why wouldnt we expect that our sexuality can change too?  We know some of the broader details dont change much you cant take a homosexual and turn himher straight but I dont see why it would seem odd to assume that the way your sexuality manifests as sexual attraction would change over time.  Thats just how the universe works in my mind.  It is what it is.,LowLibidoCommunity,cp2t7vg,1,t5_33b1b
3448791,0,t1_covz6hq,If making yourself have sex makes you cry at the very least it makes sense for you to understand why. Does havinfg sex when youre not horny hurt you physically or emotionally? What actually goes through your mind? Are there thoughts you could verbalize? You can either do what youve done to date which is avoid sex and or give in  resent having done so or you can choose to not to avoid understanding yourself amp work to change either his approach or your response or both.,LowLibidoCommunity,cpldzw6,0,t5_33b1b
4853795,0,t3_3hcck6,Just like you didnt get here quickly youre not going to fix it quickly. You need to deal with the other issues in your lives and the sex will follow. Spend more time together find a common interest that both of you can enjoy. Express your feelings honestly and frankly regarding his lack of contribution around the house. If theres no response then you have a clear path out. ,LowLibidoCommunity,cu6cv4o,1,t5_33b1b
4857812,0,t1_cu6tlje,I think its a bot.  I dont know for sure but if you look at its comment history none of it adds to any conversation.  And as a woman in the UK I agree with your comments.  I personally dont think its men who drive impossible standards that some women feel in my experience its much more likely for a woman to be critical of how other women lookbehave than men.  Im middle aged overweight very poor at hair removal gosh dont I sound like a keeper?! but I have a wonderful fulfilling marriage and even got hit on a couple of weeks ago.  Im very very far from the ideal OP discusses but I do understand other women feeling this pressure particularly younger women.  Just wish I had a clue what to do to reduce this pressure instead I see more and more young men feeling the same as OP.  Makes me sad.,LowLibidoCommunity,cu6v3pe,3,t5_33b1b

11340122,0,t1_dfcyffp,Im not trying to shame anyone  like I said I was a HL person long ago so I understand them and have been a LL person for a long time now so I understand our side as well   and I do apologize for letting my conversation with others derail your thread.  All relationships struggle for various reasons.  Its being open to each other and being able to acknowledge the pain you cause not just the pain they caused you for BOTH parties that will get you through it.  I truly do hope you can work this out.,LowLibidoCommunity,dfhdswi,1,t5_33b1b
