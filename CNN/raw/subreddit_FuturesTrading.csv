9919924,0,t3_5hhwzt,Link worked for me... just sent me to WTI futures chart. I trade CL on occasion. I normally lose a small amount of money but sometimes I make  ticks typically trade  contracts... I have been wanting to go long here ever since the pop but all my info leads me short for scalps.EditLook up how futures work on investopedia basically it is a leveraged derivative somewhat similar to options except instead of choosing your expiration date you choose your stop limit. Each tick is worth  per contract. Meaning if oil goes from  to  you gain  ticks  profit per contract. It works the same exact way if you sell short or lose money... very quick up and down. Would suggest having X cash in your account for what you are trading. ,FuturesTrading,db0lan9,1,t5_2ur7t

11264325,0,t1_df8s4ue,When I search about IB the most common points against IB I see are Sampledfiltered data feed. Minimums on commissions leading to high portion of fees unless you have a significant trading size.Do you have any opinions on these two points? The first point is the one I do not fully comprehend.,FuturesTrading,df8smil,1,t5_2ur7t
