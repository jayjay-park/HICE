3788683,0,t3_33t2r8,Problem with boycotting is that it doesnt change anything at least not on the internet unless its a massive scale. The last internet boycott  protest I remember that had any affect was the SOPA one and that was because major companies like google and wikipedia did it. People tweeting setting steam profiles commenting on reddit This doesnt get the word out to anyone whos not already aware of the issue.It doesnt stop Joe Gameplayer who only uses the steam workshop for mods from seeing some armor mod that was stolen from nexus and buying it for  bucks. And theres lots of people like Joe Gameplayer. And when they are STILL making money even on crap paywalled mods like  Gold! which literally just places a chest outside of whiterun that respawns said  gold even if its only a little money a part of the community even a BIG part saying to boycott them wont change a thing.Right now the damage is done. Valve and Bethesda have successfully ruined skyrim modding forever. Itll never be the same. Sure we have some people make free alternatives to mods like SkyUI We might have better free mods at the end of it. But the community is shattered. From now on on one side any recommendation of a paid mod will be followed up by curses and swearing on another side anyone who buys mods cant understand why people are mad at them and get mad in return on another free modders are greatly annoyed by paid modders as sellouts and paid modders are mad at free players for saying not to buy his  her mods and mad at free modders for joining in with the witch hunt.At the VERY least pirating shows that it doesnt matter if you paywall your stuff well get it anyways just to spite you for spiting us.And this is someone who used to mod for games Not skyrim admittedly but still.,modpiracy,cqo51sc,6,t5_37yil
3791293,0,t1_cqofg29,Oh I didnt mean to exactly clone it. Just each mod should have its own page with a description of it the download links a place to post imgur links and a spot for user comments.

3850825,0,t1_cqv41a8,gtOf course if everyone just went to work instead of modding we wouldnt exactly have mods then would we? This sentence was mostly sarcasm in response to the above post that was saying modders should get a job if they want money. I took it to the extreme of all modders doing just that. Of course thats not realistic but it was in the hopes of showing that modders having other jobs may hurt modding as well which progressed into a why not.Many modders are novices youre entirely correct. Modders due to basically being self employed and having such a largely competitive scene would very likely earn less but even more so it would be less stable. Working for a game dev firm would be considerably more so and so those aiming for stability would likely switch over continue on the modding gt game dev path.Though youre right if it was found that there was more money in paid modding I imagine quite a few would switch. Hell modding firms might even pop up which could solve the issue of stability. Though theyd likely be about as stable as an indie game company.,modpiracy,cqv89fb,1,t5_37yil
3994121,0,t3_34zadg,Seems like months ago I did a survey about paid mods I dont remember where it came from but I thought it came from steam. And  if it wasnt them it was from some steam community.

4149807,0,t3_3883le,Honestly I kind of doubt it. Bethesda seemed to recognize that it was a mistake. It was Valve that said they were going to try it again. gtEven though we had the best intentions the feedback has been clear  this is not a feature you want. Your support means everything to us and we hear you.  Bethesdavs.gtstepping into an established years old modding community in Skyrim was probably not the right place to start iterating. We think this made us miss the mark pretty badly even though we believe theres a useful feature somewhere here.

5401267,0,t3_3oxtvm,The only way paid mods are OK is if the mod is sent to Bethesda for quality control and testing and Bethesda releases it as a fully compatible paid downloadable content type deal. The problem with mods is that they have SO many issues working together creating bugs and issues that the modder doesnt realize or care about they can corrupt save games they wont work with other mods etc. Why would we pay for half assed content that is kinda cool made by people who arent pros? Just trying to get skyrim working without crashing with mods is a huge task in and of itself why would I pay to constantly have my game crash and have to bug fix the game myself. Paying for a large mod that has been gone over by the company who makes the game to make sure it works all the time with everything they approve is actually worth money. But that wont happen because its a logistical nightmare and creates more work for Bethesda which I doubt they want.  ,modpiracy,cw22l80,4,t5_37yil
