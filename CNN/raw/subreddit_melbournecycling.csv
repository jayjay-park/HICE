4062229,0,t3_3731tl,Popularity for popularitys sake while fixies are great in a velodrome they are pretty dangerous on the road. You need to apply pressure on the pedals and resist the rotation of the wheel to slow down and many people do not even have regular brakes on their fixie because of this. I think people ride them for the novelty and hipster factor over practicality or sensibility. If you like the simplicity get a onesie or single speed bike. Easy to ride real brakes and totally hipsteriffic. Most people cant see the difference between a single speed and a fixie. I recently got disc brakes for my bike after having too many almost doorings and other close calls and wouldnt want less stopping ability.,melbournecycling,crjbnn0,5,t5_38cev
