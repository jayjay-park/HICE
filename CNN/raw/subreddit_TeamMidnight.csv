6188910,0,t3_40bnjn,I also have overnight oats for breakfast. I use soy milk because I have trouble getting protein in and I also put cinnamon.  I use steel cut oats and add blueberries. For lunch I like soup because my office is really cold. Im going to make the African peanut soup and the vegan enchiladas from my Oh she Glows cookbook to have around for lunches and dinners. Ill probably do some eg stir fry a few times for dinner. For snacks I like the Fibre one granola bars and apples. I eat an apple every day because I think they are delicious,TeamMidnight,cyt447y,2,t5_3bqw5

6397130,0,t3_43ama6,Tonight I plan to go swimming. I havent been in a couple weeks and I need to exercise this weekend.Im going to work some running in there this weekend too!Im putting wine into old pop canisters and filling them with CO to make champagne for my wedding in September. Well have L of champagne on tap for a lovely afternoon wedding. I also have to figure out a circuit board before I try to teach my Girl Guides about it next week... Then on Sunday Im going to teach  year old girls how to build a fire and some first aid. Were going to do immobilizations and carries. The FUN stuff!! D,TeamMidnight,czgsdh2,3,t5_3bqw5
6713118,0,t3_47b0y8,Some good advice I got about running was that beginners should be able to hold a conversation while running. I have adamantly hated running my whole life but now I do a little every day based on the CK program but on my own time. I basically lightly jog .mph for about a minute or as long or short as I can go and then walk for  seconds. Its helped reduce my side aches and I like that I can decide how much I do. Not sure if that helps at all but the advice to just go slower has really helped me out since I can now jog while comfortable if only for a short time. Another tidbit plan out all of your food intake at the start of the day or even week what I do to help yourself have a plan and not feel overwhelmed. I usually just sit down for  minutes on Sunday and plan all my food through the next Saturday and also make a store list. That has reeeally helped me out with staying on track and only having good foods in the house! Then I dont stress about what to eat and go crazy with rationalizing bad foods. ,TeamMidnight,d0dozt1,2,t5_3bqw5
6816992,0,t3_47b0y8,I get very out of breath very quickly when I run but I kind of embrace it rather than worry about it and just settle into a steady rhythm and ignore the fact I sound like Im dying.Ive not died yet using this method. And today I ran k in  minutes  weeks after starting the ck programme!,TeamMidnight,d0p05gy,2,t5_3bqw5
