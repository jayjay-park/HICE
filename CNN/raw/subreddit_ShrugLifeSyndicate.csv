A race with collective conscious spanning time and dimensions that allows an outsider observer ability to any individual Q.  Or just gods but as in Asimovs story some areas of time are off limits by what must be considered to be God.  The Q would be new gods birthed by man in contrast to the old gods demons the fallen angels that God Himself chained up and has mostly limited to whispering to man.gtThough worshipped by deranged human and inhuman cults these beings are generally imprisoned or restricted in their ability to interact with most people beneath the sea inside the Earth in other dimensions and so on at least until the hapless protagonist is unwittingly exposed to them. And they want out.  What happens if man breathes life into an modern avatar of an old god?Q humor vs. PepeKek anything for the lolsPerhaps new and old gods could be backing Trump with very different purposes and possibilities in mind.  ,ShrugLifeSyndicate,d8kbhh0,1,t5_3fym9

10715818,0,t1_ddksl5r,My first experiences involved SSS JSA and The State all at the same time. While The State seems to play host to JSA and SSS the other two seem to be available without the visiospatial rendering and attention freeing qualities of Zustand.The locked in qualities of Zustand seem to manifest most strongly on LSD whereas mushrooms  mdma seem to require a fairly persistent attention and you can slip out of it if you get distracted.Regardless if you hyperfocus on a task Zustand will collapse gradually. I usually much prefer it as an experience to just tripping and so will typically get it back quickly. It usually persists until sleep with a significant vividness to the morning after  as opposed to the usual exhaustion that follows a night of tripping. If uEntideologisiere is correct it would actually explain this. If hes correct then I would posit that hes actually describing a linked feedback between these two systems that normally trade places in dominance  establishing a new network that utilizes both systems simultaneously.Super interesting! I havent studied in a while so I really havent worked on a neurological explanation of these experiences. Its quite an idea hes put forth!,ShrugLifeSyndicate,ddl99nc,3,t5_3fym9

It was a creative personal intervention from my Chinese traditions bind together with a series of emotionallypowerful dreams which eventually pulled me towards physics which ensured that I wouldnt go down my auntys route she got sucked into a relativelyinflexible belief system whilst alone at uni.So now its just my own lifepractice drawn from personalcultural history honouring that part of my existence with the motions of the SunMoonEarth system honouring physics tradition a different part of my existence.
