5883803,0,t3_3vszcc,It really depends on the type of applications you plan to build. Java today is more of a large platform and its probably best to target your learning objectives to specific areas within java.IMHO the best source for learning Java is the official tutorials along with the source code for the libraries. Google and youtube also probably contains multiple tutorials on various aspects of java and many of them are pretty good.Since you have  years of experience in C you dont really need to take most paid courses since they all make the implicit assumption that you are new to programming.I would just say pick a representative project  ie a web or mobile or desktop app  and just go for it  with the help of the online documentation and google for help anywhere you get struck. The redditrjava group should also be able to help out here.,java_programming,cxqwelv,3,t5_33mc2
