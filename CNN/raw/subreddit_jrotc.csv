2235036,0,t3_2ith5c,I verbally abused cadets and ran their dicks into the dirt during PT. Had my detractors but at the end of the day they were the best platoon in the unit trusted each other and trusted me because I took care of them and settled for nothing less than the best.Get into the real military and cry hazing every time youre yelled at or touched see how far you go.,jrotc,clnxdgd,4,t5_2ti48

7028884,0,t3_4bknzz,Ive been in a unit that had transfer students for JROTC. The students usually just got a ride from each other and drove to the school for that class period which was usually at the end of the day or the last company. If youre a senior it works out well because you probably have your own car and license so you can easily navigate from school to school without having to look around for a ride. As far as I know they were treated as if they attended the JROTC school and there wasnt any rivalry or anything. Its never too late to join and Im sure youll be accepted there.,jrotc,d1d2t12,2,t5_2ti48

7246824,0,t1_d21mbjt,Well you probably dont have a choice.  Most likely theres only one JROTC unit at your high school so whatever service they are...thats what youll be.Of course that has absolutely no impact on what service you can join in the actual military.,jrotc,d21wur9,1,t5_2ti48

Especially when you need to get DrillTeam perfect.Well in my opinion putting the damned arcs is the hardest challenge of all.

9735913,0,t1_d9ifho6,Bruh honestly it doesnt have to get all this serious. I understand youre trying to be professional and formal but the most professional and chill way to get over this is just to approach your colleague. Tell her bruh we are conflicting here and I dont like it. Is there something you see wrong that I can do better? You know along those lines. Shes not a  year senior NCO and youre not a commissioned officer. Serious documented counseling isnt necessary but tattling on her to the commander isnt gonna win her over either. Just be chill and hash things out thats real peer leadership. ,jrotc,dad5wfs,1,t5_2ti48

10333093,0,t3_5nviih,She needs to try to figure out WHY they dont take her seriously.  Is it because shes a girl?  Is it because they think she doesnt know what shes doing?  The WHY is very important if you want to correct the behavior.Aside from that if she takes a professional hardworking tone with them that should help to remotivate them.  Tell her to be all business in practices focusing on the things they need to work on.  Also she should remember that she can delegate  if she has other cadets who are sharp have them help those one or two cadets who are struggling while she works with the rest of the team.  She doesnt have to do everything.,jrotc,dcfbauj,2,t5_2ti48
