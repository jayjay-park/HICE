576973,0,t1_cg5szl7,well i took some maps had a goal riding down to nice and knew that northitaly switzerland and france have quiet good roads in alpine areas. if i had enough from riding for a day i just searched for the next camping spot and after setting up the camp i ate something and looked on the map for curvy mountain roads for the next day. i had nothing organized before just packed my stuff and took off. as a single motorcyclist you always find a spot to camp even in the main camping season. i would say that on this trip every km there are at least one campingplace and most of them are marked on a good map. nothing to worry about imo. if you have time dont use freeways. they are expensive boring and there are a ton of really good curvy broads with beautiful scenery in those countries.  personally i was not a big fan of lakeside campingplaces. they usally have a street around them and cars go by there at am so sleeping is not really good there. also they are more expensive. watch the specific speed limits for each country. italy  switzerland  france have ridiculous speeding fines! italians drive like crazy i still have no idea how they can afford this way of driving. dont worry about the kmh speed limit on broads in switzerland  there are very curvy roads there so  is most of the times just fine. in france youve got to have a yellow warning vest with you.  switzerland is expensive food fuel but extremly beautiful. campingsites on this trip were usally around   day for one person  one motorcycle  small tent.  most important words to know  italy passo .... france col .... austria ....pass  that means it is a pass and believe me... there are a looooooooot.quickly searched some places where i was too lazy to get out the maps and photograph itstart in linz aut  postalm aut  berchdesgaden ger  groglockner aut   plckenpass autita  tolmezzo ita  lago di cadorre ita  passo gardena ita  cavalese ita  lago di caldero ita  passo di mendola ita  lago del garda ita  overrated expensive kmh around the lake really hot in summer  lago d idro ita  ponte de legno ita  bormio ita  stelvio  times up  down  D  tirano ita  st.moritz ch  splgen ch  bellinzona ch  andermatt ch furkapass!!!  martigny ch  st. petite bernard chfra  search for street D fra switch to D barcelonette fra and just look for a brown sign with Route des Grandes Alpes on it... you cant miss it there are a lot of them. this will lead you down to nice. ,motocamping,cg5uu24,4,t5_2tko6

7180401,0,t3_4dssg5, You can also roll into most state parks after dark and leave before sunrise to avoid fees. In the south Baptist churches almost always have pavillions. Roll up turn off sleeping bag on picnic bench. No need for a tent and the worst thing that happens is a livein priest greets you with coffee. Most rural areas Hardwaresupply stores with sheds on display. Sheds are usually unlocked and dry. Roll up roll in turn off spread out. Get up before everyone comes in for work though. Farms are usually separated by patches of forest in the south and much of the midwest. Roll up pitch a tent. Watch out for the dogs barking though farmer might come to investigate. No bueno. Along the coasts Boat launches and public beaches usually have showers. Roll up park head off to the side of the beach and sleep under the stars. Showers are cold but if you get up early enough its dark enough to strip and wash. Bars Roll into a town around happy hour. Sit at the shittiest looking local bar and have a beer. Most small town folk will strike up a conversation. Explain you are on a crazy motorcycle trip one person will be a kindred spirit usually and either point you in the right direction for a nice place to camp or sometimes let you in their back yard or BONUS even a couch with a shower.,motocamping,d1ucj40,10,t5_2tko6

7710934,0,t1_d3ijzbb,From the other threadgt Not nearly as exciting as it sounds...I grew up in the suburbs and never had to do the whole parking meter parking only allowed Tuesday to Thursday from the left of this sign from am to am every other week unless blah blahWe were excited to be in Canada and found some special motorcycle parking spaces I read the sign wrong and we woke up the next morning to our bikes gone. We shrugged and said okay and hung out with those girls from the hostel and explored Granville Island figured wed just call it really expensive and safe parking and deal with it later.gtNext day comes we start walking to the impound lot thats about  or  miles away in the rain. We get there learn we have to pay the fine for impounding and also the ticket. Whatever I reach into my pocket and look for my debit card. Its not there. Fuck. I distinctly remember buying snacks on the way back from the club last night I was upset that Canada didnt have Flamin Hot Cheetos but they had fucking Poutine Cheetos?!. Anthony paid for his motorcycle drove back to the hostel couldnt find my card and drove back and was able to pay for mine for the time being.gtLuckily I had just dropped my card in the elevator of the hostel that morning and when we arrived back to our room we had a note on our packed up luggage reminding us that checkout time was at am it was about noon or so now and that my debit card was at the front desk.Lesson learned.

8966308,0,t3_533cch,Ill never buy a piece of MSR camping gear again if it can be avoided. I was using their Whisperlite International stove which had a pinsized hole in the fuel line. This caused an undetectable amount of fuel to leak which then eventually caught fire and the tank then exploded. When I spoke to Cascade Designs the owners of MSR they told me in no uncertain terms that they would never replace or reimburse me for the damaged equipment. So I went to a dealer in Santiago Chile I was on my way south from U.S.A. to Ushaia at the time who did swap out the stove for me. I felt bad leaving them a nice locally owned store who was trying to do the right thing with what could be a ripple in their relations with their vendor but my bet was that theyd get more traction than I was getting with MSR. rant,motocamping,d7pm5jz,13,t5_2tko6
