4180994,0,t1_crwtvo8,Pretty sure the user agreement indemnifies them from any legal action probably has some binding arbitration bullshit in there to cover their buns. After all theyre just facilitating the transaction between you and the vendorclient for services the most you could probably do is get your  back. You could try and go after the person that sold you the crap but if the vendorprovider is in some other country your legal options can be pretty damn limited. Plus people get banned and open new accounts all the time trying to pin down who screwed you over  months later can be impossible in some situations.,startup,crwu53p,1,t5_2qhyd

4582417,0,t3_3ds5uv,What is your marketing plan? Do you have a website ready to go? Do you have an email list or any sort of interested customer base?Regardless of what you do have you need to validate your product. Youve mentioned that you can produce a vast range of things at low price points? but that doesnt really solve anything. Just because you can PRODUCE anything doesnt mean you can sell anything. Do you have some sort of marketing or launch plan when you inevitably want to start selling things? My suggestion? As soon as possible like hopefully immediately begin with a small test run of something. Whatever product you want. A solid MVP offering to the market. Figure out some advertising get a site up and run with it. Manufacturing has a large initial cost and set up but you can still start small. Outsourcing little things like packaging or something at the start might be a good move. Create your product and sell it. If you get customers ramp up and begin scaling. If not switch markets or marketing strategy or something.,startup,ct87s1c,1,t5_2qhyd

5694916,0,t3_3t3cxk,Unless its really cutting edge stuff ideas are nothing and execution is everything.  Someone has almost certainly thought about or even tried what you are doing before.  Talking to the right person who will put you in touch with people you can grow with partnerships with other startups are amazing for this give you amazing feedback or share previous experience is invaluable.  Spending a ton of time getting a launch ready just to find its a poor fitshould have been built marketed or packaged differently is a huge waste of time and energy and often lethal to a startup.I wouldnt worry about well just build it threats.  First mover advantage is huge and they are taking a massive risk trying to build it and missing the magic sauce.  Fuck them.That said I dont go full spectrum blast to potential customers besides maybe a mostly ambiguous hype page  email signup to gauge interest sometimes without knowing what Im going forward with.  This is because you really start making promises with whatever you put out there and its easy to make people disinterested when you change something and no longer deliver.  This makes talking with everyone you can even more important.Huge companies like Apple can thrive off secrecy because people already care and know about them so it just gets them excited.  Who is going to be excited when you dont say anything.The top secret startup thing is fun but not optimal strategy in my experience and I tend to roll my eyes when an entrepreneur without a launch wants a signed NDA and a room without windows to discuss their ideas.  Shit is probably already someones abandoned weekend project on github.,startup,cx30ces,5,t5_2qhyd

7510676,0,t3_4i7l32, Dont go out looking for a cofounder. Go out looking for someone you get along with who just so happens to have the skill set you need. If you dont gel well your startup is dead before it even started Theres no set formula for these kinds of things youll need to work thst out on a case by case basis. Theres no way to prevent someone from taking over your company. Sure you can retain ownership legally but there are other ways to informally take over a company. You just need to assert yourself.a That being said you really dont need to worry about a take over until you have something worth taking over.

Developers do not give a lot of outside . They are mostly introverts . As a prime example  look at all presentations of Steve Jobs . He is always in a black sweater with no inscriptions .Each presentation is always the same . Now further . People think a lot of code and write. It requires great concentration.

But if the environment changed in the last  months  I would want to have a serious meeting with the VCs and layout the issues and changes. Find out in detail the path forward they see. They may be seeing something you do not. I would be open to continuing or reassessing the market. Also I would view your position more in the line of saving them the money from the potential bridge round rather than not giving your all. ,startup,d7t6cqr,2,t5_2qhyd
