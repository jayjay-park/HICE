2773590,0,t3_2omyqm,Hi I am IT minded with quicklearning technical skills. I have mainly worked with web design film and DTP softwares as a creative at heart but I am looking for work in anything within grasp of my strengths and this fits the bill seeing as I am nerdy to the max.The real question from me is I am moving to London as soon as work presents itself and will be looking to settle there permanently. Would this part time job be something that could afford me that? Even if coupled with evening bar work to help pay the bills. I dont mind roughing it and as an employee Im sure I will be of use to you as I am highly motivated to succeed.If I interest you please pop me a message with contact details so I may discuss my skill set and find out more about the position.,london_forhire,cnjchqr,1,t5_2sdbo

4896740,0,t1_cubk5aw,I second this. Dont say you lack the experience. Dont say youre ok with anything. Dont say youre looking for what most people would consider a very low salary. Dont say youre not good at something. Actually dont mention any negatives or any expected salary at all. Show passion enthusiasm willingness to take on a new role and a challenge to think outside the box! You can do it just try and be more specific about why you want to be an office assistant what excites you about it why you would be good at it what specific skills you have learned that would make you great at it where you have learned them and how. Drop me a PM if you would like some more specific advice.,london_forhire,cubru3q,4,t5_2sdbo
