1877636,0,t1_ckert1x,. It will make selection a bit trickier but not radically different.. Yeah I misunderstood you but always keep cheater detection in mind when thinking about signaling. Yes in basic situations where youve found a new food source or new technique its easy to catch cheaters. But in more complicated situations e.g. believing that youve figured out that the stars can predict personality or animal migration or weather cheaters will exist.. Beyond the quibble that no one is burning  calories walking  miles. Any loud expression will signal approach behavior no? Beyond when the expression is explicitly paired with an utterance of Run or somesuch anything out of the ordinary is going to cause folks to be inquisitive. Generally it isnt clear to me what distinguishes what youre calling joy from run of the mill happiness. To take some basic factors from Paul Ekman are expressions of joy cross culturally recognizable?  is there physiological pathways for the expression of joy that are unique and distinguishable? does voluntarily expressing the maybe specific facial expression of joy artificially stimulate the physiological response?I dont think anyone at least inside this subreddit is questioning whether emotions are social.,evopsych,ckfg5e2,1,t5_2qsg3

2277961,0,t1_clt9w1o,ampampamp Race human classification sfw gtRace is a social concept used to categorize humans into large and distinct populations or groups by anatomical cultural ethnic genetic geographical historical linguistic religious andor social affiliation. First used to refer to speakers of a common language and then to denote national affiliations in the th century people began to use the term to relate to observable physical traits. Such use promoted hierarchies favorable to differing ethnic groups. Starting from the th century the term was often used in a taxonomic sense to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype   gtgtImage iInteresting Racism | Race and health | Multiracial Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcltwb oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecltwb.

4963915,0,t1_cuk38wx,What is your evidence that it is a minority part? Genghis Khans offspring make up something like  of the population and are probably almost completely the product of rape.  Now lets multiply this across every other conquest in human history over the entire span of homosapiens or before that to earlier species and I think its probable that every single human being alive is a product of rape at some point in their ancestry.,evopsych,cuk8nr4,1,t5_2qsg3

6595172,0,t1_d017dry,. Yes of course they would eventually create a surplus. How else would anyone have raised kids???. I cant be bothered countering this.Youre trying to convince me that its a great cost to adopt a child i.e. its detrimental to the adopter which presumably counts against the adopters evolutionary fitness. But you must agree that the same cost exists regardless of whether the adopter and adoptee enter into any sexual relationship? To me this makes the idea of pedophilia irrelevant as it could just as easily been an altruistic urge to adopt rather than a pedophilic urge.And remember individual fitness trumps group fitness at least for humans no so for certain insects.,evopsych,d01htts,1,t5_2qsg3

7295450,0,t1_d279fth,This study basically says if I see a black dude and assume fast ecology but then learn that he is a successful engineer that has a nice family my racial stereotypical profile will be supplanted with the new information.It does not reject the idea that there is any merit to race being a cue for ecologically driven stereotypes. It merely suggests that its ultimately ecology not race that we are concerned with and we use whatever heuristics are available to us to make that judgment. Because it does not reject the ecology association it is racist. The standard progressive argument against race is there are no differences between race except for physical attributes. If you believe that there are possible behavior implications depending on ones race then you are racist.,evopsych,d27fyml,1,t5_2qsg3
