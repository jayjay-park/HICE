Im pretty glad he didnt get off work early and was sitting in his car when it happened. Semi truck guy was cited and the guy in the white truck stayed in shock for a bit.

They put you in with new guys since obviously you arent learning what youre supposed to be learning and youre basically just in basic training a lot longer. Also I went through USAF basic which was super weaksauce compared to some other branches and still nobody laughed. Theres this huge aura of fear and intimidation thats thick in the air from the moment you get off the bus it nips any wannabe jokers in the bud. Theres this sort of herd fear thats instantly instilled in everyone as the  or so dudes youre with are accosted by  screaming dudes for  hours straight as you get your hair cut get your uniforms make your beds eat your food and everything from the time you wake up to the time you go to sleep to the amount of carbs you consume to the amount of fluids you drink they make you drink and randomly ask everyone to upend their canteens. Anyone who has water pouring out wasnt hydrating enough gets to do shitloads of pushups and is then made to drink a shitton and everything is just scheduled and regimented and timed to a T. You have zero control over any aspect of your life and only  of a drawer to keep your nonissued possessions in. After about  days of this your mind has already kicked over into some base survival mode and thats when the clusterfuck gangbang of  dudes constantly in everyones shit stops all at once and youre down to one or two dudes shepherding their herd of turds until they manage to graduate. Its a transformative experience and Id highly recommend it to anyone. edit Stop downvoting the guy above me.

Its not some calculations. Its an observed event. So unless Ive been hallucinating for  years and only about really mundane shit like a ball moving and being stuck its possible.

10105095,0,t1_dbonk38,Food burning in the oven in the absence of spilled grease and other flammable crap wont ignite your house. Dishes cooked in the oven for long periods of time also tend to be the sort that arent quick to burn. If youre making stock and left it simmering unattended for literally hours it is unlikely to go up in flames unless you forgot something like adding water. Gas leaks can happen with or without the oven or stove being on and can likewise be ignited from other sources. In addition many folks dont even have a gas stove. Ive moved well over a dozen times and have never had one. And if you do have gas appliance unless you turn off your furnace and water heater when you sleep then ZOMG theres fire in your house while youre sleeping!Carbon monoxide is completely undetectable to human senses. Being in the same room as a source of CO isnt going to do you a damn bit of good without a detector. And it can come from noncooking gas appliances which again many people dont even have.

11352456,0,t1_dfifuns,Exactly.  Its not as common as you think but I do believe some events actually require the riders to wear helmets.  Some pro BMX riders that never wear helmets you will notice at some of these events they are wearing them like everyone else.  Personally I think if sponsors incentivized the use of helmets no helmets no sponsor that could possibly have a drastic change on these extreme sports.  A lot of younger guys eventually take a shot at getting a sponsor anyways with that incentive it could encourage more people to use them.,Wellthatsucks,dfis32u,1,t5_2xcv7

What you can establish is that he hit it farther than that.     Assuming that no magic happened the ball went into an area that the batter could reasonably forsee.  There was a vehicle in that area.

You are right about the colloquial term but it instills a false sense of uncontrollable chaos.The new usage idea is that every collision is thought to be preventable the word accident gives people the illusion of not being at fault while all parties could have practiced safer driving habits to properly limit the potential for any such debacles.
