652326,0,t1_cgddoao,I dont think any rule would need to be changed. These effects go off if the defending creatures are on those types of landscapes. They are essentially hate cards  sideboard cards if youve played MTG  which give you bonuses when playing against a specific type of deck. Confectionary Ring is almost a knockout when playing vs an unmodified Jakes Deck but useless vs the rest of the field. I imagine Blue Plains will get the most use of these effects being able to move your guys into the right lanes to trigger the bonuses. ,CardWars,cgef3qu,1,t5_2v5dg

1400824,0,t1_cirgsxk,I noticed the same thing but Im not sure if its just confirmation bias. I wonder if disabling the battle wheel would even out the odds of a card drop.,CardWars,cirvgq1,1,t5_2v5dg

1699540,0,t1_cjtdnsy,Yes. Youve never played against a human. You never wondered why only your spin always decided which player went first? Or why no player ever surrendered against you even when they were losing badly? Its pretty obvious by the way they play too. The computer makes mistakes that no human player ever would like playing brief power and then not following it up with anything or using a hero ability that adds magic points and then ending the turn.,CardWars,cjte1no,3,t5_2v5dg

2134042,0,t3_2jdoal,Sort of hack that shouldnt be used. Hopefully they fix this. While I think they need to up the Algebraic Chest ratio it still isnt right to cheat them of their gems. Say you do that  times until you get a Algebraic Rare card. Thats  potential gems but they only received . Seems unfair.,CardWars,clb30qc,0,t5_2v5dg
2134273,0,t1_clb30qc,This is tough for me. I think the issue is the ratio of drops. After obtaining three gems from the quests do I really want to open an algebraic chest and receive a Detective Bobby? He can be found in the cool chests as well as loot in a couple of quests. That is unfair to me. If it were only cards that could not be obtained any other way I would fully agree. ,CardWars,clb42rd,5,t5_2v5dg

Just for the initial sequence of loading the match and ending the matchPlus flooping your land and spinning It takes  seconds.

5725651,0,t3_3tjn0h,Daily gift roulette change is definitely intentional. There is a second gold card now.Also Brief Power doesnt reduce the cast cost from cards anymore visually.

6709458,0,t3_47irzg,I feel submitting tickets for bugs and emailing is a good way to notify them of things consumers dislike or notice is broken. Getting on the same page about what those less savory aspects are so that we can notify d is important so we can discuss exactly what we like our dont like.

8026049,0,t3_4p2vej,I have gotten many good cards out of it but it is expensive in terms of HP cost to get it. But without the Dungeon wins I wouldnt have these cards so to me it has been worth it.

But a heavily powerful play I promise you there are some other nasty combos out there.I think for  energy and  cards in your hand I can kill any monster with smelly belly and premade grave.That is more of what I thought you were suggesting.  ,CardWars,d5h3mdt,2,t5_2v5dg
