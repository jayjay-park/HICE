3262648,0,t1_cp03usc,Im hugely into music so I first noticed it when I was listening to tracks in my good ear only and they sounded lower than usual. Since then theyre even lower than before and Ive noticed that everything else that I hear including voices etc sounds lower than before.When I say Ive lost the lower frequencies I mean the nerves have  presumably been destroyed so I cant hear them. The upper frequencies the high pitched stuff thats a real mess too really distorted and painful to listen to. All of this together with a deafening tinnitus is making me borderline suicidal.,hearing,cp06o66,1,t5_2sb9h

9749378,0,t3_5eo81i,You have two options as I see it. Eighter audio shoes or a ComPilot. But with the audio shoes youll also need a wireless transmitter. If you have lots of money you should by Roger audio shoes and a Roger Pen. The Roger Pen can either get a signal via cable or via Bluetooth. So the ComPilot is the cheapest option. You wear it around your neck and connect via Bluetooth or a cable. ,hearing,daeto9i,1,t5_2sb9h

11374252,0,t3_62apls,I wear a hearing aid that is a behind the ear with dome. If youre looking for more domes because you have an issue with excessive wax buildup you can remove these domes and squeeze them to remove some wax and wipe them with a damp cloth just be sure to wait until completely dry to place back on the receiver or tube that you took it off of. You should not have to replace these often unless the dome rips or something like that! There are universal domes but they differ by manufacturer to best fit the hearing aid so as to not fall off the receiverthin tube or get stuck in your ear I believe! and to also provide optimal amplification believe it or not little differences in the slits of your domes might impact on the amplification of your hearing aid the ability for the aid to provide directionality and the feeling of being blocked up those are little differences but I think they can make an impact on some patients especially those a little more sensitive. My advice to you is to contact the person who fit you with your hearing aids. If you cannot reach the dispenser or audiologist find one in your area. They should be able to easily contact the manufacturer and provide you with some domes I know that oticon is very generous with sending extra domes to their hearing providers. However it is up to the discretion of the provider whether they will charge for domes. You should not really need so many!
