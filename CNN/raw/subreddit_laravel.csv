The problems I have seen with this on shared hosts is the php version available in the cli and the inability to use ssh in the jailshell. a seems to have a work around for this.  I am sure there are some other hosts that are available but I wouldnt recommend hostgator at all anymore. ,laravel,cenp7hp,1,t5_2uakt

429002,0,t1_cfp32hs,Its all about SOLID principles. Theres actually a lot of good stuff in this rlaravel thread that just happened...To be specific on where to put the hashing functions you can use the builtin Eloquent accessor for now thats totally ok IMO. Youre mixing concerns into the model that shouldnt really be there a models job should really be to contain data and nothing more but thats just fine for now. I personally feel that its more important to understand where youre making exceptions to SOLID practices e.g.  mixing concerns and why than to strictly adhere to them.Generally speaking I create a presenter to go along with my models. Heres an example of how you might do that...    lt?php        use App        class PastePresenter                 protected hasher                protected data                public function constructpasteData                    thisgthasher  Appmakehashids            thisgtdata  pasteData                        public function hash                    return thisgthashergtencryptintthisgtdataid                        public function getname                    ifmethodexiststhis name return thisgtname                            class Paste extends Eloquent                 public function presenter                    return new PastePresenterthisgttoArray                    The findByHash method is something youd normally define as part of PasteRepositoryInterface check the other thread I linked for more info on that.,laravel,cfp8bya,2,t5_2uakt

1448358,0,t3_2aqfuh,First I do a high level overview of all the components I want the app to have or that it will needed.I then wireframe the hell out of them to come up with a good structural design for the site.Once I have that structural design I start making target comps for both the overall design and for each component. I dont write any code until Im happy with the target comps why? Because I dont do it for clients either  nothing worse than writing code that you have to throw away because of designs that arent finalized yet.I dont believe in form over function OR function over form. I believe both are necessary and need to mesh well. A clean visual interface free of functional clutter is just as important as a functional website free of visual clutter. Both are necessary to help achieve one another.Clean focused components and a clean UI also help make your code clean. Less shit on a page means less data to swish around before spitting it out into a template. Cleaner template files cleaner data path from your database to your template etc. Funny how focused single responsibility code and focused single purpose UI compliment each other so well...One might say that its silly to try and design everything up front in so much detail because you have to use the system first to find out what you like and dont like. While theres some truth to that I prefer starting heavily with design for a few reasons. A sharp final design is one motherfucker of a motivational tool. You dont have a nebulous undefined target of what you want it to be  you have something VERY concrete that you want to hit.. Ever hear of measure twice cut once? Well thats what design and planning is  measuring. Cutting is doing the coding. The more you have to cut your code the more code rot you have  the more orphaned dangly bits are left floating around the more you cut corners because youre just trying it out to see how it feels and then proceed to leave prototype code in there once youre satisfied with your sandboxing.. Similar to the above design is cheap and disposable.  shitty design drafts of a design dont matter  they go away. They dont turn into an implementation swamp the way  iterations of code can.. Designing in detail first gives you an opportunity to really think through the user flows of your components. You can rapidly iterate different flows in your head. Draw them out on paper sketch out supporting UI. Again this planning and brainstorming and thinking is cheap and doesnt impact anything because nothing is built yet. Really this is an opportunity to simplify and prioritize as well as really assess in detail what will be involved in the implementation.Even something as basic as a US state field can have a pretty big impact on implementation. If its just a blank text field then you only have to worry about validation. If its a drop down select field now you have to figure out where youre going to get the data necessary to populate the field protip drop down state selectors are terrible UX  significantly slower than a text field for most users. So imagine that  taking the time to do detailed design work ahead of time and think about the UX leads you to a conclusion that is both better for UX AND easier to implement!So I invest heavily in design and planning first. As easy as it is to slap together a prototype in a framework like Laravel I find that I lose motivation more easily because I hate seeing some sickly bootstrapped skeleton sitting there with ambiguously defined functionality. And because I quickly prototype it Im inclined to keep my shitty prototype code rather than start over once Ive gotten it in place. For me detailed wellthoughtout comps are better than MVP prototypes.,laravel,cixtsux,13,t5_2uakt

1711292,0,t1_cjutopa,The easiest will be to just have the user input one at a time. The second easiest would be to use this method the user types multiple in with a delimiter.The last option is to find a way to integrate it with some kind of clientside tagging system. Such as this jQuery plugin  This is considerably much more work to do and you must know javascript for this method. It will require an AJAX call when a user creates or deletes a tag.Depending on the use I would just go with the second method Dont suggest its for multiple tags but offer the functionality. Maybe have the text box and then a add tag button next to it It would be  functional to add tags one at a time but yet also if a user decides to try to use commas to delimit the input it would work as well.EDIT For the third option There would be another AJAX call for the tag autocomplete feature.,laravel,cjuvcdg,1,t5_2uakt

4219880,0,t1_cs0iooe,Personally I think youre on the right path... You can save significant costs by rolling your own solutions like that you just have to program your resiliency into the infrastructure and start brushing up on moving from system administration to devops. Some tips  Set up a puppet ansible or chef server with automation scripts to build a new frontend web servers on demand Make sure your web servers are behind HAProxy or you use Cloudflare or some kind of reverse proxy like that Set up your automation scripts so when you deploy a new web server it adds it to your HAProxy or Cloudflare config to help with the load balancing Its OK to run MySQL as a slave on your frontend servers but you should keep your master on its own server.  Deployment server is a great idea. That way you can spin up a new web server and git clone the website to the server as part of the process For backups I would suggest setting up TarSnap. its inexpensive encrypted and takes one more thing off your plate to worry about. Plus it would let your backups reside offsite.  If you want to have even more resiliency migrate your web apps to use a mail provider like mailgun or sendgrid to send your email. When email sending fails it usually does so silently. Receiving email is a lot easier than sending. ,laravel,cs18ygu,2,t5_2uakt
4249849,0,t3_39kzeu,Ill throw this out there but Im sure Ill get some heat from others about it I prefer Fedora Server over CentOS or Ubuntu.Ive managed all three and CentOSUbuntu absolutely are better at being able to set and forget with minimal active administration.

4558595,0,t1_ct578cg,Sure. But the part of our application is not that smart or big but I can give you some insights. I simplified everything because our system is to complicated to explain in a single comment. Lets say we create Shops and have Product tables.We use this autogenerate a table thing when we have to start a new shop. We name this shop Max Shoes. Our system then generates a new table based on a given blueprint for his products. The table name also comes from a template. It will probably be something like shopsmaxshoesxhkh RandomString at the end. The tablename is stored in the Shopmodel. Then the user can add new products to his shop and all rows are stored in his specific database table Has like  columns or so. Lots of data here!.We do this to split everyones data into their own table and because we had some issues in an older version of the system where we just couldnt add a new column to the table because it went to big.Now comes the funny part. As you know you can specify the table name of a given model through the table property. We use this in our Eloquent calls like so        products  new Product        productsgtsetTableshopgttablename        productsgtwhereNameConversegtgetgt Note When I wrote this I just started using Laravel and getting the grasp of OOP. I think you could also do this through the constructor of your Model like so      In your Mode    function constructtableName  defaultproducts          thisgtsetTabletableName         In your Controller or somewhere else    products  new ProductshopgttablenameAs you see you can accomplish this in many ways. Maybe even with an Eloquent Relationship. If someone knows how this would work let me know But this maybe doesnt answer your question right? What you might want is Many to Many Polymorphic Relation Sounds a bit scary but is really powerful. Lets say we still have Shops and Products but now your Products table is much smaller. Your users could then add their own columns through this poly.relationship and an additional Columns table.Your tables could look like thisshops id name tablenameproducts id namecolumns id name label More readable name valuecolumable columnid columnabletype e.g. AppShop or AppProduct columnableid  e.g. product or shop id But keep in mind this system might sound awesome but you may run into MySQL performance problems if you would use to much of those poly.relations.Not everything is perfect but it might help you. ,laravel,ct589mj,3,t5_2uakt

4644660,0,t3_3ekr66,I think the problem is that each time you add an input rows it creates a new array element so the link and store are contained within successive array elements e.g.You wanted              link gt  store gt Store         link gt  store gt Store     But you get            link gt         store gt Store         link gt         store gt Store     One way to do it would be to use namelinks and namestores then loop through them both at once e.g.jQuery      ltinput typehidden namelinks value  link  gt     ltinput typehidden namestores value  store  gt Controller      foreachinputlinks as index gt value         model  new ModelName        modelgtuserid  Authid        modelgtstore  inputstoresindex        modelgtlink  value        modelgtsave    ,laravel,ctg0w0l,1,t5_2uakt

You could inadvertently return something from your methods that leaks that abstraction.If I return a User Eloquent model and then do something Eloquenty like usergtloadcomments in a controller or something Ive totally ruined the point of the abstraction and interface because now my controller is making a reference to something Eloquent despite whatever the contract the repository adheres to.You cant just inject an implementation of an interface and assume everything is ok.

8362884,0,t1_d5mvc0d,Interesting. I decided against implementing something like that in the package itself as it would be overkill for the majority of use cases and adds a significant level of complexity i.e. you would need to have a tag instance before you can attach anything. I dont think it would be too difficult for you to adapt it to your needs. You could change the tag column of the mediables table from a varchar to a foreign key to your tag table then it should work at a primitive level as long as you pass it IDs.    mediablegtattachMediamedia taggtgetKey    mediablegtattachMediamedia taggtgetKey taggtgetKeyIt would then be up to you to extend the mediables trait andor the media class to be able to convert that ID into a tag model instance when and where your use case needs it. Remember that the tag column is a pivot value of the relationship so you can access it with mediagtpivotgttag if loaded through the relationship. Also note if the same media record is attached to a model multiple times you will only see the first tag which was used to access it from the model this way. If you need to know all of the tags connecting a media to a model use the mediablegtgetTagsForMediamedia method.,laravel,d5mwulo,1,t5_2uakt

8811843,0,t1_d771oll,I would agree that the documentation does not cover applying a policy to an entire controller automagically.BOOM!  Knew it. I read amp googled around and found this    gtAnother neat gem in the authorization system is the authorizeResource method now available in controllers. This has the potential to considerably clean up your controllers. So what does this magical authorizeResource do?In short it replaces all your calls to authorize in the various controller methods with a single call in the constructor    use AppTask        class TaskController            public function construct                    thisgtauthorizeResourceTaskclass                     ... all resource methods ...    gt Thats all it takes! You can now skip all calls to authorize in the individual methods. Laravel will now automagically check the right abilities for any given action. Its pretty magical actually.,laravel,d772b47,3,t5_2uakt
8836538,0,t3_513hoe,Thanks for all the replies guys. First of all I think that our website and demo doesnt explain it easily enough and people get concerned what is it all about. We will prepare a demo video soon so you should get the point.In general the system is pretty advanced rather for companies to build standalone or SaaS applications. You can deploy it for your own purposes but also offer as a licensed software.It is not a simple admin panel nor CMS rather a whole backend application youd let endcustomers log in to to manage e.g. their account service invoices with RWD UI based on Material Design. ,laravel,d7a0zyi,1,t5_2uakt

9645537,0,t3_5d2nc2,Im still researching but I think theres sort of a spectrum of options from packages that do everything for you with limited to customization to the other extreme of packages that just generate some template code that you can use as needed to add to an existing project.I think this is a list of some of the better known options that do something along these linesScaffolding  Code Generators   Generates standard Laravel code scaffolding using Artisan commands.  No UI.   Use a UI to generate basic standard Laravel code scaffolding. Has an online version that you can use to generate your code without installing anything.Form Builder  Runtime libraries   No configuration UI just define your fields in PHP code and it helps generate the HTML dynamically. Complete BREAD  CRUD Functionality   UI to generate Laravel code scaffolding I think? and the code uses Backpacks own extended CrudController CrudRequest etc. to provide special functionality.    UIbased configuration highly opinionated limited customization I think?.There are probably many others.  Im still researching.,laravel,da20fqu,10,t5_2uakt
9651438,0,t3_5d8hmv,Curious why not just use a CMS for the whole site? You havent given any reason for pickingusing Laravel but mainly ask about CMS integration and features.

10385930,0,t3_5ok4xy,Do a multiobject delete so one request to delete an entire collection. This allows you to first verify all of the items are legitimate and then you can store the individual items as a collectionDELETE deleteThe payload could be as simple as a JSON string or even an XML document thats entirely up to you.

But I want to see if I can fix this.It is my understanding that php artisan queuework queuedownload would fire once ... and either run  job and quit or just quit if there were no jobs in that queue. When I run it manually it processes the  job and then sits there as if its waiting for another job. It doesnt return back to the prompt.I have it set up using a scheduled job in Laravel with the following    schedulegtcommandmydatadownloadgtwithoutOverlappinggteveryFiveMinutes    schedulegtcommandmydataimportgtwithoutOverlappinggteveryFiveMinutesThe commands for those look like this    Artisancallqueuework queue gt download timeout gt     Artisancallqueuework queue gt import timeout gt ,laravel,dd17mi4,1,t5_2uakt

10864770,0,t1_ddzzfai,Nope building on production which kinda negates the way I worded the original question now that I read it again.So lets say Im on Laravel . and have migrated from gulp to mix for the purposes of sass and CSS combining etc.  If I understand everything correctly that means running through the npm install process on the production server so that I can run npm run dev and generate the final files.  Similar requirements even if I still use gulp actually.  Anyway if thats correct thatll leave a lot of stuff on the server that is only required for the build but not required for the app to run.The guts of all the replies so far have been dont worry about removing them  Im cool with that and can understand why others are saying it but its just never been the way I operate servers.  Basically Im a if I dont need it it doesnt need to be there person.
