232413,0,t1_cf4nvf5,There is  maybe  people at the desk. And  maybe two at the doors. Do you want them to ask the possibly hundreds of people coming in for the event if they are using the gym? You as a gym goes may be one person but you might be walking in with  other event goers. You stop at the entrance as you should but now they stop and the desk person has to deal with confused event goers. There is also no magical RIT student detector. So there is no reasonable way to know if a person is a student. And now if they do know who the students are they have to be sure to let those students and only those students through. So now they have to be checked twice or leave the doors open. Also now because its a free for all and the doors are open you get lost HS students and Lost parents. Which staff will also have to deal with.So now we have confused event goers. RIT students coming in and out possibly and very likely among eventgoers and possibly lost event goers who dont realize how the building is set up. This of course can all be solved by having more staff. But it can also be solved by just putting up signs telling students to go around eliminating every single mentioned problem and just making students walk the same amount they were going to anyway just outside instead.The practical and best solution is just to do what they are doing.

Outdated maybe our apartment isnt one of the renovated ones so we have wood panelling and whatnot but its not bad. We have a fully functional kitchen and bedrooms which was really my criteria. And as you said you really cant beat the location and the price. Our apartment is actually cheaper than living in the houses on the other side of the river where a lot of my friends have ended up. Also another bonus is that housing doesnt really care that much during inspections they just check that the fire safety stuff is not obstructed no bothering otherwise.

747782,0,t1_cgp9pt3,I know I was leading back to my original point about some of the disgusting . comments on the article.At any rate my understanding is that the actual point of Deaf Culture is that it is shared culture among Deaf people. This primarily manifests itself in the form of artistic expression community events cultural icons things that any culture shares. What youre describing with Deaf people coming together to ask for accommodations isnt synonymous with DC. The culture exists on its own outside of the hearing world.The point of those accommodations are to allow nonhearing people to also exist in a hearing world. Deaf Culture has nothing to do with that. Is it hypocritical for someone fundamentally Deaf to be angry at a lack of accommodations? Possibly but I dont think that discredits their culture.,rit,cgpa29n,1,t5_2qh3x

That said... each department has to pay for a Dreamspark Premium license. The terms and conditions say that only students actively enrolled in the department or taking a class in the department are eligible. What your department does and what the terms and conditions say are two separate things. Your department can let anyone they want to enter. It violates their agreement but Microsoft leaves it up to the department to verify who is an eligible student. Again all of this relates to Dreamspark Premium. I have no idea what the MSDNAA terms were or how long of a subscription your department may have paid for but MSDNAA doesnt exist anymore.

If anyone in another housing renews aka does their paperwork for Phase I they are guaranteed their spot in that apartment the following year. If you dont mind buying a microwave shitty internet service thats comped by RIT and a few hot weeks per year which with a fan is pretty bearable then youll be just fine in RK. Just because its cheaper that doesnt mean housing operations is any less responsive to any maintenance tickets filed as well.

Considering these complexities its not as simple as enabling an API switch somewhere.From conversations with ITS we have learned that a lot of institute data is currently transferred in jobs that run daily. Its possible to hook into this process and create daily jobs for the purpose of opening up API access.I cant speak to any timelines regarding this work. We are currently in the process of identifying which types of institute data students are most interested in having access to. Tech Committee has made it a priority this year to open up API access and our ITS representative has been extremely valuable in exploring this task.Lastly I would recommend creating separate petitions for separate API feeds that way we can gauge interest in different data sources available.

2167141,0,t3_2jtwzc,Hey man I felt the need to reach out on this one.  years ago I was in in the same exact boat as you. I got out of the Navy in August of  and started at RIT in September. I was also  going on  and was really nervous about the whole idea of college. You will soon see that the last  years you sacrificed really start to pay their dividends. I also know the apartment search is really stressful. I was actually deployed until a couple weeks before I got out and trying to find an apartment was really difficult. I went to the blogs but everyone kept replying that I had to stay in the dorms. The dorms was just not an option for me. From going back and forth from barracks and the ship to finally getting a house I was not going back to that lifestyle. So I went back and forth between getting a spot off campus or at one of the RIT campus. Without knowing anyone and not wanting to chance getting a crappy living situation I decided to go off campus. There are down sides to it as other people are stating. It was hard finding a group of friends but as long as you get involved in clubs and what not you will make friends. I am now very involved on campus and have multiple groups of friends. As for anything else you might need Im willing to extend my hand to help you get situated. Shoot me a PM if you have any other questions about making the change or RIT in general. Ill do my best to make the transition easier.,rit,clfalmj,2,t5_2qh3x

4325219,0,t3_3afsgj,As someone whos entering their fourth year in the GDD program and has gotten a lot of experience through myself and peers I will say this about our major It has potential to be very broad and very deep.  For the first year or two its helpful to see all the aspects of what goes into making a game from art coding design and production.  This major does a very good job about letting someone explore the game design industry by getting your feet wet in  areas and hopefully in the future there will be a bit more emphasis on production of games.  The issue though is that for a fouryear program you easily become a jack of all trades but master in none and in the current philosophy of the job market where you hire people who are very specialized that can put you at a disadvantage.  Thats why going into the second half of your GDD curriculum and preferably before if you feel comfortable you have to start tailoring your curriculum into what you really enjoy about GDD and design your classes based on your interests.From my experience in the games industry which is not a whole lot just started a coop at i theres two things companies strive to look for in their potential hires Extreme passion for what you do and looking for candidates that have stealing this terminology from a presentation by Valve TSpecialization.  TSpecialization is defined as being very familiar in all aspects of Game Design and Development the  I mentioned earlier and also a very specialized passion and affinity for a specific area mine was physics coding.  If people who recognize this early in their college career focus on both demonstrating their extreme passion and love for what they do as well as having a correctly balanced TSpecialization companies eat that up and wont hesitate to find a position for you in their company.The GDD major provides the right setting to accomplish both of these goals but BE WARNED it is very easy for students to be stuck with either too broad of a curriculum that shows no specialization and cant compete with the more specialized candidates or be stuck with a too specialized curriculum that will suffer in the games market when you have to understand your teammates work and have a good understanding of their roles in order to work with them.  So if you enjoy the games industry and want to be a part of it RIT will provide you with the necessary tools to be successful and enter the industry but it will take some cunning curriculum planning as well as good interview skills in order to create the perfect candidate.,rit,csd6ixz,3,t5_2qh3x

And also since there is a GDD minor that gives you more classes to work with.Now Im not saying you have to take this route but it is an option.

6722556,0,t3_47pi8b,Depending on the age of the bike tuned gears can mean anything from adjusting the position of the derailer to replacing the chain and rear cassette. Also can you be a little more specific with what is broken on the breaks? is it the cable or housing? is it the arms? have the pads simply warn away? All of these questions can change the price of the repair regardless of where you take it. RIT offers some great classes on bike maintenance in the long term and they have a very active bike club that at least use to run maintenance tents every once and a while. The internet is also a great resource for all things bike repair.  might looks ganky and old but it is one of the best sites out there for bike info.  As far as shops go Full Moon Vista is my favorite place its further away from RIT than Berts but the staff is very knowledgeable and is more looking to get a returning customer than a quick buck. if you decide that the fix on your old bike is not worth it  is a great option it has a great selection of old donated bikes for well under  and its a charity. ,rit,d0eo53a,2,t5_2qh3x

8490083,0,t3_4v7ufk,GREETINGS! D Im actually just transferring into Film and Animation from Archaeology this Fall so assuming youre still going to go back to this thread and read this perchance I can give you some advice coming from somebody who transferred. xD If you are DEAD set on transferring into Film and Animation it is VERY possible to do so but youll need to place HEAVY emphasis on  things grades and an application essay.I was able to maintain a . during my entire freshman year but if you at least hit  a . you SHOULD be fine gradewise. Regarding which classes you should take I suggest getting EVERY perspective out of the way EXCEPT your math and artistic perspectives as math wont count once you get into Animation and the major has its own artistic perspective that you MUST take regardless of whether you took an artistic perspective or not. If possible I would suggest taking at least  photo class for nonphoto majors before the end of the year as Film and Animation majors are required to take  CIAS classes to graduate pluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuus the photos from the class if you take it seriously will do wonders for you in a portfolio. scratches head As for the essay portion eeeeeeeeeh...it varies from year to year but the essay that I was asked to write consisted of  parts. The first part was a short description of your skills while the second is about a real person that you respect. The entire thing cant be longer than  pages but if you ask for editing help in the writing commons and take a few weeks to edit it like a madman you should be fine.  In conclusion while its not IMPOSSIBLE to transfer it does take work and if youve considered transferring then perhaps the work will be worth it. The worst thing that you can do is second guess yourself all the way through as thatll make you miserable in your current major and might result in your grades slipping. As for the job market despite the competitive nature of the field youll have PLENTY of opportunities as an animation major if you work hard. RIT is one of the best animation schools in the country for a reason and its graduates have gone on to work for all sorts of companies many of which are the biggest names in the industry. shrugs Who knows perhaps one day well see your name in the credits of a Disney movie. ,rit,d62t3r1,1,t5_2qh3x

9468416,0,t1_d9g2yse,The only pure programming class in the major is a semester of MATLAB. Everyone Ive talked to about it either found it easy or hated it so its hard to comment on its difficulty. We had no strict deadlines on our assignments so I think that if you force yourself to not fall behind on the homework you can do fine in the class. We never learned much more than solving equations and importing and graphing data so I dont think its that bad. The workload keeps me busy but I never feel busier than my friends in other majors here. I tend to feel like there will be one or two slow weeks and then maybe a couple weeks with lots of assignments and exams so even though sometimes it does get a bit overwhelming the course load will usually start to lighten up before it gets to be too much. It seems very few people in the major took programming classes before coming here. Its a useful skill to have but it really doesnt make up much of the curriculum from what Ive seen. I dont think having a formal engineering background is super important either thats what youre here to learn. Engineering is all about problem solving so as long as youre coming in with creative ability of any sort and some ability to apply mathscience you should be fine.Physics is a pain in the ass at least the general physics classes are. Im in University Physics  now and was in University Physics  last semester. These classes cover a lot quickly and the exams can be challenging. That being said most people in the major only took a regular high school physics course before coming to RIT so few people are coming in with a particularly strong background in physics to begin with. This is a class where you will have to work hard but you probably wont be any less prepared than your peers.In general I dont think you need a very specialized background to get into the major. You will start off taking mostly math and general science courses and these will lay the foundation for the actual engineering classes you will be taking later on.

I come from a very conservative South East Asian family so this was a fun discussion with Mom especially.Im technically an Engineer but I think most of the RIT grads would look down their noses at me.What matters is that I make a very decent salary and enjoy what I do. Rarely does one end up working their field of core work.Yes you will be more likely end up in the field you studied in especially for specialized engineering but keep in mind that if you are not enjoying concepts and cores now these fundamentals will weigh heavily on you in industry.Also worth noting what jobs are in demand today may not be in demand when you graduate. That is something you should seriously keep in mind.What your parents think is best for you versus what you know is best for you may be polar opposites. Yes they raised you and they may be supporting you but if they trust you they will enable you to be your own person.,rit,da5lgje,3,t5_2qh3x

11541179,0,t1_df5swop,Currently finishing my nd year in Comp Engineering!During the career fairs there are many employers visiting from throughout the US. We definitely see some of the bigger ones from California  think Apple Google Microsoft etc  all looking for computer related majors. One think I found out while being here is that we are very hirable. There are lots of jobs out there and in this major you will learn all about both the math software and hardware behind computers. If you do well and stick with it the job prospects are pretty high. I know very few cases where people did not go on co op by their third year. Most employers who visit RIT have some kind of position for us. As for the program  its a challenge. If you love it you will be  ok. There are lots of late nights working on labs and classwork but its all worth it. If you stay on top of your assignments and visit with profs often things will work out just fine. Fortunately your first semester will consist of gen eds and an intro course so you will find out earlier on if its really for you. As for me I REALLY enjoy this program. Computers absolutely fascinate me. We have a very close knit community and our own wing in the engineering building which I really enjoy. Most of the older guys are willing to help out if you just ask. If you have any more specific questions feel free to PM me!,rit,dg470by,3,t5_2qh3x

11688037,0,t1_dgkn532,So Im actually a Web and Mobile Computing student. Although I know SE students use databases they dont go too in depth with them. It seems like you want a full stack developer that has experience with databases and building software that allows a user to interact with information stored in that database. Both Web and Mobile Computing and Computer Information Technologies majors have to take intro to database course and are the majors that generally have the most knowledge of databases and how to retrieve information from them. Although I agree with urcarz in that the major doesnt really matter as much as the skills necessary. I suggest that you create a more detailed job description that you post here andor on RITs jobzone if youre specifically interested in RIT students. Those students with the correct experiences would be able to tell you how they could potentially implement the solution you are looking for and would have the requisite skills for it on their resume.,rit,dgkuung,3,t5_2qh3x
