229242,0,t1_cek2n6q,These other posts make it seem like vaginal birth is a breeze and there isnt as much risk. There is just as much that can go wrong and be dangerous when it comes to vaginal birth. The way I see it is youre having a baby  if anything is going to happen that would cause you or your baby harm its just going to happen.,CsectionCentral,cf4ibrr,2,t5_2u7i6
477526,0,t1_cftr2n2,No problem!  You were very coherent not at all rambling.I totally see your concerns.  Again Im not trying to convince you to have a home birth but I just hope that every woman makes truly informed decisions especially when it comes to pregnancy and birth.Midwives are medically trained professionals.  They are more highly trained than nurses and are able to carry out every medical procedure for birth except for Csections.  Midwives and doulas dont exist and work in a perimeter that is completely naturey woowoo or any of that.  Doulas and midwives are trained to use techniques based on evidence from scientific studies.  Of EVERY SINGLE medical specialty obstetricians come DEAD LAST in the use of evidencebased scientifically sound medicine.  They are seriously behind the times.  Quick factsThe American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has recently released a study and statement emphasizing the importance of doulas during birth.Typical birthing positions recommended by doctors today have been proven in medical studies to slower more painful birth necessitating forceps vacuum episiotomy and other such interventions.Multiple studies have also confirmed the importance of a mother to eat and drink normally during labor if she has the desire to and have shown that hooking laboring women to IVs and forcing them to abstain from food is actually harmful and also makes for a slower more painful labor that is more likely to necessitate interventions.Obstetricians are trained surgeons.  They are not trained in the skills needed to support a healthy natural birth.Its true that women have died from childbirth and that complications that threaten the life of both mother and baby arise.  Where youre mistaken is that midwives and doulas are illprepared for such crises.  Thats it!  lt lt lt  I fully support your decision to get a csection but dont do it because of misconceptions about alternatives!  Again I highly recommend books by Ina May Gaskin theyll help you during your pregnancy labor and postpartum periods regardless of how your baby joins the world.  Sending you love. ,CsectionCentral,cfujq03,3,t5_2u7i6
550053,0,t1_cg2coh6,good point.  The nurses here seem to be trained on BF they help with positioning some better than others but a lactation consultant should be specialised I must be doing something wrong pain is very sharp and nipples are bleeding,CsectionCentral,cg2splt,1,t5_2u7i6
758719,0,t3_22r6bs,I understand. I dont know what slowed things down but as soon as I got the epidural the contractions lessened in intensity and frequency. The same thing happened with my first. I just wouldnt progress.,CsectionCentral,cgqiu5d,1,t5_2u7i6

1071007,0,t1_chpqmix,The spinal was seriously no big deal at all  the issues I had werefirst time around with an obnoxious anesthesiologist  I have a ridiculously tickly back.  If you touch my lower back especially I will jump.  Its completely involuntary.  My first anesthesiologist actually yelled at me for jumping when he was poking around my lower back to find the right spot to place the spinal.  I seriously dont remember anything else bad besides that...Second time around  Remembering the issue the first time around I asked the anesthesiologist to administer a local so that I didnt jump when he touched my back.  No problems during the placement.  This time I had some mild nausea during the surgery  I think this is due to BP dropping due to the meds they give you didnt happen the first time around because I had pree and my BP was high to start.  I just let the anesthesiologist know during the surgery that I was feeling weird and he adjusted the meds and I felt back to normal within literally seconds.  I think it happened twice during the second surgery.  Remember that in particular the anesthesiologist is there for  YOU to make sure that you are feeling comfortable the whole time.  Let them know how youre feeling so you have no issues.I had a cath both times.  I think its standard since with a spinal you wont be able to get up out of bed for  hrs or more.  For me both times the cath was placed after the spinal went in but before I was completely numb.  And since when they place it your legs are in a knees bent and slightly splayed position like if you sat down leaning back and placed your feet about a foot and a  half away from your butt then dropped your knees to the sides  both times in recovery I had the unnerving sensation of my legs still being in that position despite being able to see that they were straight out in front of me.  I would say that all told from me laying down after my spinal to me getting brought into recovery it took  minutes.  That was for my singleton delivery I think the twins took a bit longer.  ,CsectionCentral,chq10m6,2,t5_2u7i6
1260867,0,t3_28gwn2,The two things I was told to do to reduce my swelling were drink lots of water and move my muscles in the swollen area.  Breastfeeding gave me extreme thirst and I  had over  liters of water a day approx  oz per feeding  times a day.  I also kept my feet propped up when I sat and wiggled my toesfeetankles constantly.  I dont remember feeling swollen past  months like this. Based on your other comments in the thread I would caution you against taking anything other than your prenatal vitamins.  Water pills can easily dehydrate you which can reduce your milk supply.  As for the vitamins my doctor told me I did not need them and my diet was not nearly as healthy as yours. If you are walking around plenty I would guess this would go away on its own.  If you are still concerned I would recommend more water.  I had to pee before AND after nursing those first few months and I had cases of water in the car because my  ounce cup would run out while I was doing errands and I felt like I had swallowed cotton balls.  There just never seemed to be enough water and I was glad I had already mapped out the best bathrooms while I was pregnant.  ,CsectionCentral,cibgoiy,2,t5_2u7i6
