392838,0,t1_cflchjl,Yes Im planning on the same character being both DPS and Heals once I get the nd weapon hotbar.  From what I can tell making a pure healer or DPS might be a little much.  I think Ill be able to do both just fine with one character.  Regarding PvP I cant honestly say because I really dont know what Id be getting into either way lol.  Really it all depends on what my group of friendsguild will be doing as with PvP Ill do whats necessary to help the team goal.,ESOc,cflhfbq,1,t5_30azl
397245,0,t1_cflu6lp,True this. Its kind of disappointing but at least we dont have to worry about getting beat because of a better machine. Also it will be that much easier to claim emperorship!,ESOc,cflxv3u,2,t5_30azl
547577,0,t1_cg2i2s8,I think Im closing off this topic I wanted to close it off after the last but we needed a ps mod. I will keep you in mind as we gather more players especially on the ps side of things. Thanks for applying and sorry. stick around on the sub and that will only increase your odds.,ESOc,cg2il1k,1,t5_30azl

843836,0,t3_23snhi,I play FFXIV on the PS and previously on the PC and for the entire time Ive used a controller. FFXIV has at least  active hotbar buttons that can be used at any time and these are easily mapped onto the controller.Heres the best video Ive found about it but feel free to search YouTube for FFXIV cross hotbar. The video is in Japanese but has excellent subtitles and goes into great detail about how the controller can work well for an MMOThe point of sharing that is not to say that ESO will be just like that but to show that its definitely doable and shouldnt be any sort of obstacle for having a great experience on the PS.  I love playing FFXIV with a controller. Its far superior to the old mousekeyboard set up. Took some getting used to but I really really like it.,ESOc,ch074h2,2,t5_30azl
