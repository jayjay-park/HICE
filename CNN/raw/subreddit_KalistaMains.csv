8089364,0,t3_4pgfix,Mostly slows. The slows can really screw the animations on Martial Poise. Especially supports who have heavy damage and crowd control in their kits such as Zyra Nami and Karma. I do however believe that Kalista is probably one of the only ADs who can handle a Soraka lane quite well.,KalistaMains,d4pbh75,1,t5_34nfa
9548975,0,t3_5bi60f,I climbed to Plat V with Kalista only this season last season I was Silver I You still can get really fed and end the game in  minutes but its not as easy as before patch .. The nerfs make doing well with her even more satisfying like you mentioned,KalistaMains,d9q3x0t,1,t5_34nfa
9613359,0,t1_d9xln2v,Exactly did expected such kind of a reaction and instead of really trying this build as suggested retire to some silly presumptions gt Ok I have no idea why you would go CDR on Kalista when your damage is coming from your rend which resets cooldown when you kill a targetwhen you kill E only. This requires spearlodged minion nearby or rend only as a finisher and pry for a great estimate it would really kill the target. This way you lose opportunity use it midfight to reposition yourself get better estimate about fight progress and scare factor should be also taken into an account  from prey to hunter overturn. Not mention at prolonged trades enemy CDs for dangerous abilities like CC and gapclosers are refreshed. Too risky without Rends slow.And what about other abilities like Q or R ? Waiting for ultimate at L for  vs  secs is a big of a difference. Sparser use of abilities leads to a suboptimal play and missing full potential.gt Bork doesnt do shitty damage. Its dueling potential is hundreds of times better than runaans.This does not make any sense. Why do you compare BotRK with Runaans which you have also in your build ? Builds should be compared as a whole because of different synergies. Your build completed with Dominiks for example loses about  AD at L  .    x  and  CDR adds  AS and  CS. AD loss is compensated with BotRK passive only at targets with over  HP at AA full loss at abilities. And not only raw numbers but overall balance like damage consistency survivability risk factor etc. But that would require some empirical experience not only theorizing.gt Kalista shouldnt rely on AS and AA only She needs some burst damage and chasingretreat potential and a bit of sustain. Ok A There is nothing wrong with relying on AS and AA.lost important word  only resp. solely between linesgt Saying she needs burst is wrong firstly Kalista is not a burst champion she is a champion that excels at long trades due to her rend.Some burst like Q or E midfight with CD reduced. Q also allows reposition anytime even when enemy is in that fragment of second out of AArange. Also count chasingescaping over walls in.gt That exactly what building AS gives you with your build Runaans is your only attack speed item which means A LOT less mobility and hence less kiting from martial poise.it starts to get boring .. In my build are mentioned also Berserker Greaves if missed. But even if I choose Swiftness AS from Runaans find enough with  greater MS and slow effectiveness reduction Achilles heel of Kalista affecting AS from dash too. You may play against weak players or have some really great team with constant support and protection but in higher ELOs more experienced enemies wont let you dodge and pike them from Martial poise for ages. Usually two  three dashes at max then reposition. Thus AS is not of such a great importance as you may believe.gt Leaving Q and E at  secs cooldowns is just bad. No its not bad its perfectly fine. Your Q is not that useful its only really used for a long range shot which your not going to use that much at all and for the rend it might as well have a second cooldown and a good Kalista could still have the same potential. You should NEVER be using your rend as a slow unless you are chasing someone that will  not turn onto you or your going to back off as soon as you rend.It was already explained other uses of Q and E. Lack some background for that NEVER statement.gt repeating yourself wont do the same myselfp.s. Im Gold II only but started just this midseason.,KalistaMains,d9y1kyo,1,t5_34nfa

I think the best mix if your going to take them is  attackspeed glyphs and  magic resist glyphs. DO NOT take this page into the likes of brand  velkoz  zyra.

11546421,0,t3_64kp43,The standard page is AD reds Armor yellows  AS blues  MR blues and  AS quints. If you are running natural talent you might consider wanting to swap out  AS quint for a Lifesteal quint. You can also consider swapping your flat armor yellows for scaling health if you so desire.  ,KalistaMains,dg4sf6e,1,t5_34nfa
