3310602,0,t1_cp5gut8,Thank you for the response! Here is the game synopsisBasically the synopsis of the game is that all of historys crazy people have escaped the underworld and all the gods have to band together to killsend them back. It is somewhat going to be controversial in some senses since it is going to poke fun at the the villains and the use of gods. The game is going to be comedic and satirical. We are still working on the story but that synopsis is pretty much set the details is what we are working on currently.....a specific villian we have decided on is  Osama bin Lifin. A greenish and very very muscular version of Osama. Would you still be interested in working on such a game?Please let me knowThank you,INAT,cp5mwya,1,t5_2ui2u

9634042,0,t3_5cuu7t,i have to say the engaging part does not seem quite engaging. Watching the video made me bored. Then again I feel like the lack of cards moving or shaking somehow makes it dull to watch. Also the colors are not that eye popping unlike infinity wars or heartstone. Yet good luck with your progression with the game. Maybe I will change the view  of your game as you continue with it.,INAT,da0lecq,1,t5_2ui2u

10854215,0,t1_ddzgn07,In that case save yourself some work and use this as a creative exercise to come up with your own characters enemies and a basic plot of sorts. Feel free to just use the Metroid gameplay mechanics and slap your own ideas on top of them no one is expecting the next big thing but it feels good to finish a game project regardless. ,INAT,ddzjaa8,1,t5_2ui2u
10984140,0,t3_5vj1dx,Wouldnt a d MMORPG be more feasible? From the top of my head I know of  MMORPGs that have been made with teams consisting of  people runescape when it first started out and heaven and hearth. Now when I think about it I think rotmg was also made by just two guys its a skill based rouge like mmorpg with permanent death mechanics also d.Also how do you want the magic system to be? Mana based? Will there be healing magic?,INAT,ded0muh,1,t5_2ui2u
