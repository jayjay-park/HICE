37880,0,t3_1uhvsv,Do an internet search for source TP socket. You can find them for  USD each about the same price as the lamp. It is a fully contained unit the leads come attached to the socket. ETC has a pdf on their website   that will instruct you on how to replace them.As an aside make sure when you put new lamps in that the spring clip fits on top of the lamp base not around it. That is how you know the lamp is seated properly. If the clips are around the side of the lamp then it leaves a gap and arcing starts. Then you are right back to square one.One other note I am assuming that you have the later version of source four post . The earlier ones need a conversion kit to make them accept a w lamp. If yours have a handle on the endcap or have a w sticker on them then you have the later models.,techtheatre,ceiqsbl,2,t5_2r2ne
133221,0,t3_1vkvqc,First understand that some people around you are dropping those terms as a kind of dominance behavior. You have no reason to feel bad for already knowing them and NO REASON TO FEEL BAD ABOUT ASKING QUESTIONS. If someone makes fun of you for asking questions make fun of them for expecting you to be psychic.Here is a quick ELI for some of the terms you mentioned Disclaimer I stopped working as an electrician a while back so if any professionals still on the front lines correct any of these explanations listen to them.DMX A data protocol for sending control signals from the lighting console to lighting instruments. Instruments must be assigned an address from  to  This is why the protocol is often referred to as DMX. DMX addresses are often set on older fixtures using DIP switches and to set them youll need to know a bit of binary math. Look up charts online to explain. Many consoles are able to handle more than  addresses but tend to do so by having multiple sets of  or universes. Something could be at address  in the first universe and be controlled separately from address  in the second universe. Chances are you would refer to the second as address . Everything connected to a DMX universe gets the same signal but only responds to signals that are intended for the unit at its assigned address.Dimmers Conventional lighting fixtures regularass lights emit different lighting intensities based on how much power is sent to them. Dimmers take in raw power from the wall and output a portion of that power based on what the lighting console tells them to. Dimmers are assigned a DMX address which is how the dimmer knows what signals from the console are intended for it.Powerthru Didnt know this term I dont do much in electrics anymore but a quick look suggests that the Desire LEDs have the ability to run power from one unit to the next in the chain. Instead of each unit being powered separately they can be connected in chains back to a single power source. Every type of unit will have a limit on how many units can be chained and you should find out what it is.Daisychains When one device is connected to another similar device in a system instead of directly back to the power or signal source. In the case of LED systems there are usually a set of fixtures that connect to each other and one connects back to the brain box. In the case of the Desire units it appears that both power and control signal can be daisychained.LED fixtures LED fixtures evolved to work on conventional systems but they have some differences. Generally they need constant power so dimmers dont do them any favors. They need consistent power and DMX input usually multiple channels of it. If you look up the Desire LEDs online you can get to ETCs documentation that explains the various control modes of these units and understand how they work. As an electrician you need to know a how many DMX channels the unit needs this varies by the settings youre using and b how to address the unit to the first of those channels. Often the way LEDs are used is by controlling the intensity of Red Green and Blue diodes RGB mode. These primary lighting colors can mix into virtually any color which is why they can be used to replace scrollers. Many consoles have userfriendly ways of managing this control. For some you can input a gel color from your favorite manufacturer and it will tell the fixture what to do to produce that color.Any other questions?,techtheatre,cetlqjt,9,t5_2r2ne
194438,0,t3_1wbboh,Unfortunately summer stock jobs dont pay much. In theory they give you housing so a small stipend is fine. But man those stipends can be tiny.At the summer stock I worked at in Western MA artisans made  a week. As the Assistant Prop Master I think I made . Another company I worked for hired almost exclusively interns at  a week. It was crappy and illegal but it happened.Ive seen many ads looking for Masters for ish a week. Which is a crappy rate for a crew head but there are plenty of people willing to do it. Always ask for more money. Every time youre offered a job ask for more money. Even if youre happy with the number. Ask for a travel stipend too. Worst case they say no and you end up where you would be anyway. More often you get more money.Ask about a travel stipend when they ask if you have any questions at the end of the interview. Dont make it the first question but include it. That puts it in their head. They often dont discuss salary until they offer you the job. When you get the offer say something like Thats going to be hard for me. Can you do any better?

490704,0,t3_1zqjw8,As a knife collector it is my time to shine! Invest in a good plain edge knife. If you maintain it it will cut everything you need just fine. The only reason I would get a serrated knife is if you are cutting thick rope often. If that is the case go full serrated. Spyderco makes some good full serrated knives with a good serration pattern. If you want a multitool of course look at Leatherman or Victornox. If you just want a pocket knife Spyderco Kershaw and CRKT have good mid and low price options.

646307,0,t1_cgd6vns,That is a very good point however I think there are a lot of people who want someone to do the work but dont care enough about the quality to pay someone. They want someone who has a camera who can point it in the right direction and dont care much about the persons training. Perhaps because they dont know enough to recognize the difference in quality. I think there are a very large number of people like this and theyre the ones who are asking for work to be done for free. Unfortunately so long as they do not value the difference in quality those people are never going to be a source of income for artists.It seems to me that trying to persuade this group of people to pay artists for work is an uphill battle because they do not recognize the artist for their skills. I know this is much harder said than done but it is more reasonable for the artist to instead locate the people to work for who demand a higher quality that requires training. And unfortunately until theyre able to produce that higher quality artists cant very well distinguish themselves from and thus make more money than hobbyists.,techtheatre,cgdqhbd,1,t5_2r2ne

4118795,0,t3_37tfyb,I run lights at alternative music concerts on the side mostly rock and metal but Ive also done blues and jazz and whilst I think your drummer has made a great effort hes also made the mistake of doing too much to fast imho. Moving heads are great when theyre moving but they really really really shouldnt move for  of the concert. It gets old real fast. You dont have a great many of them but you can employ tricks like running a chase and moving the heads around when theyre off creating an illusion that theres much more lights out there than you actually have.I dont know at what point in the show this song is played but if its near the beginning of the show youre basically making the rest of the show a lot less interesting. You also run the risk that when youre too active during the verse you wont have anything to top that during the chorus.Pace it out a bit. Start slow keep some effects up your sleeve for later theyll be much more impressive when theyre special. Chill at the start of the song dont fade so fast. You want to create some mystery and anticipation and that can be achieved with second fades just as well.The chorus with the red green blue white strobes is what we call a funfair. Way too many blinking lights and total chaos. Less is more why not stick to two colors that complement eachother? Youll get a much more coherent show. Also speaking of colors where are they? All Im really seeing is red green and blue wheres the rest? Im talking about light blue orange yellow these all match very well.Also I feel like you could do something with lighting the band itself. This bedroom display is fun but how are you going to use them when youre playing live? Are you going for the contra look lights up high behind you are you going to use them as floor lights or are you going to use them as front lights?Keep in mind that this post is  experience and  opinionpersonal preference.

4345745,0,t3_3aqmfw,Well you need to think about a couple of things. One is that adding signal boosters or gain to antenna system is not what you are looking for.  Adding gain to your system will increase the radius that your antennas pick up. If the antennas are located off stage with the receivers its not necessary. It can actually be harmful because now you are picking up a bunch of crap that you dont want.  Also gain introduces more noise to the signal. Now when when would you want to add gain? The most common reason is to compensate for cable loss.  If you have  or more of wire between the paddles and antenna you should sit down and do the loss calculations and figure out if some amplifiers are what you need.  But in general most people dont need them and dont understand why they should or shouldnt use them.  Lower power mode is useful when you are running a lot of packs. The reason is that more powerful transmitters can drown out other packs that you have on stage but further away. It also reduces the amount of intermodulation among the transmitters.  Shure has some of the best information on how to properly set up a wireless system and can help you with some of the calculations. ,techtheatre,csfhx0n,6,t5_2r2ne

Its an extremely busy program the design and production had hands in  or  shows by midterms wether they were theatre operamusicals or dance shows. You really hit the ground running. All of the professors are down to earth and will take time to talk to you if you need it. Its a really tight knit family dynamic that has been created since theres never really any more than  tech majors at a time. Im majoring in lighting design and production myself and Spring semester of my freshman year I got to design a couple of things albeit they were childrens theater shows in a space the university has just for that.

We had w LED bulbs mounted behind when lit the color would come through the gray front.  for the single book to flash I has LED Strips mounted behind a single book.for the dream sequences the boy sat on a bench that had book shelve underneath it.  when the sled flashes red we used LED strips under the seat to flash down onto the books.Apple I took a plastic apple from hobby lobby.  I cut peeled the plastic covering carefully into halves.  The apple had a EPS foam and a rock core i guess the rock is for weight.I cut the EPS foam and put a remote controlled relay inside bought off eBay. The relay was ran off a small v battery. the EPS Foam was cut so the relay circuit board  and batteries could fit inside. We cut the foam a little on the outside and wrapped it with v RGB LED strip wired to the red LEDs the LED strip ran off a separate battery.  covered the circuit board batteries foam leds with the original plastic outer shell. light sprayed the outside with gray paint.When the apple was tossed a stagehand pressed the remote to flash the LEDs. make sure actor doesnt spin the apple when tossed it could make the relay trigger.,techtheatre,cugqf7i,2,t5_2r2ne

One day a conventional fixture backstage got replaced with an LED which was bright enough to reflect off a set piece very faintly.  In the IR shot the reflection looked like a creepy face and would wiggle around during that blackout while the scene change was happening.  The board op was so scared of what he saw that he tried to arrange a seance to put this spirit to rest.

He and a student were moving a genie not raised or anything from one space to another but did not notice that the locking pin that prevents the tilting from happening was not secure. On a slight incline the genie tilted and he pushed the student out of the way as it crashed down on him.He was rushed to the E.R. and had major surgery on his arm and knee.

7424828,0,t3_4gxy3c,Preface I went to a high school with an active theatre program in a town where the high school theatre was the primary performance venue. I was involved with school shows local community theatre and touring musical and theatre acts. I came out of high school with lighting rigging audio and scenic experience. I learned a lot in college.It is valuable. Many high schools tend to be somewhat isolated from the professional world  the theatre programs can definitely produce bright capable students but they may not have the same understanding of the process of putting up shows that professional companies do. College is a great place to learn how things work in the real world and to prepare for how professional companies work.Additionally your professors and fellow students will be a valuable resource in the future.I didnt finish my theatre degree but the time I spent in school taught me to collaborate the language of design and how a show goes together. I worked summer stocks in the same time period that further trained me to work in a professional environment and thats also something I recommend.Dont ever assume you have no more to learn  you may decide college isnt right for you but consider it as a very useful option.Also if I was in a hiring position Id probably be leery of someone straight out of high school even with a dozen productions under their belt. If they have a degree or some college Id feel it was more likely they had the language skills to work well in the team if that makes sense.,techtheatre,d2m5kud,4,t5_2r2ne

If OP ever shows up again and say runs a huge iMovie render that takes hours and heats up the machine Ill bet he sees much the same issue.  Then we fairly reliably say Its not the program.

If the console is already using shownet for control leave the consoles Ethernet port doing that. Then use one of the DMX ports for the keyboard emulator and the other DMX port to a node for artnet.  You wont be able to install drivers for any USB devices without a crap ton of hacking but it would not be worth it because you could just use another computer. There is nothing special about the palette processors other than custom metalwork and a powered USB hub. Open the lid of the console. Take all the USB cords and the USB channel key and plug them into a powered USB hub. Now take that hub and plug it into a computer running the palette offline editor. You now have a functional console that you can install Minecraft drivers on. Having said that however I am  sure the palette software will not let you specify what Ethernet port to use because it assumes you only have one and Im not sure how it would handle multiple Ethernet patch routes of different protocols but I imagine nothing happy as they recently released a new node and one of its features was being able to send and receive different Ethernet protocols at the same time.  Im not familiar with the Pandora server. What other control will it accept? Palette can also output serial commands if the server will listen to them.  Also mind giving more details on the DMX to keyboard converter? I dont think I have a use for one but it may be fun to play with.  ,techtheatre,ddba8fg,1,t5_2r2ne
