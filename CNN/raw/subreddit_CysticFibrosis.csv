674626,0,t1_cggvtxb,God bless everything about you and this post. I made some big decisions over the weekend in terms of my relationship to this disease which Ill be happy to share later in PM but Im in a daze right now for unrelated reasons something that just happened not drugs lol so I want to come back to it fresh and this spurs me on even more.Also awesome simple username. If you dont mind me asking have you found anyone to share in salinity with?  I am always of the mind that if I find someone and we love each other I will have to understand if it freaks them out and I would certainly still fall for someone knowing I could lose them but I cannot expect someone who hasnt been us to understand that to the degree that we do. Just wondered how thats worked out for someone that seems so close on paper certainly not in spirit.EDIT Decided to write here instead...I had a weird sort of epiphany where I realized that with almost undetectable daytoday increments I had gotten myself so scared of not just death but a life of everincreasing suffering that I hadnt quite given up but nevertheless lived the life of someone who had. The brick wall I feared hitting was just too believable as an inevitability based on my day to day experiences.I decided to be bigger than my circumstances and even if I felt like dying to choose to live. It sounds simplistic and clearly if youre not giving up you must have will enough to push on. But its larger than that. Feelings are convincing. Numbers are also very convincing. But strange things happen all the time. As a result I know it cannot be proven that I wont be around in say ten years versus the two Ive been given.That and Ive worked for years now on not worrying about things until they happen and while its to this day something I still work on the underlying message is the most important part If you dont know if you cant know and its  rather than being afraid of an imaginary future reality however much it seems fated to be...you choose hope. You choose it every time even if it seems like the most difficult option.Does it rewrite your existence? No. But Id rather be the guy that dies trying than the guy so consumed with fear that he goes out overcome by what surrounds him.,CysticFibrosis,cggyed1,2,t5_2r876

1683596,0,t1_cjrd9mr,I have discussed it with my CF docs a few different times.  Each time they have told me that the risks of the procedure outweigh the rewards.I am extremely interested to hear more about your experience though.  Off and on I have had ongoing troubles with bleeding since about .  I have had  times where I had massive amounts of blood come up and embolism was discussed but each time the bleeding seemed to clot itself and the docs were never convinced I needed it.  As Im sure you know the bleeds SUCK and I actually felt with some severe anxiety and depression directly related to them.  If you dont mind can I ask you some questions?  Were you actively having a bleed when the procedure was done?  My doc has told me it can be very difficult to find the source of the bleeding unless there is active bleeding going on.Assuming that the procedure was not done in an emergency situation did the doctors discuss risks with you before hand.  My doctor expressed concern over serious complications with the procedure that could involve losing use of a large part of my lungs leading to a big decrease in lung function.If you have time I would greatly appreciate to hear about your experience,CysticFibrosis,cjrdp4b,1,t5_2r876

2614895,0,t3_2ptgus,I think its going to depend on how much time you spend a day doing treatments and your general stability. I just had my first stint of working a  for two weeks and while my lung function isnt that low I found it very difficult. Things like cleaning the house and cooking fell behind but worst for me was the fact I couldnt exercise. I definitely feel it in my lungs but my health tends to be quite unstable. I have frequent infections and things like a change of weather or a slight change in environment can really throw me for a loop. Im sure the stale recirculated office air didnt help me either. But again I have wacky health that doesnt seem to correspond to earthly rules. Im still going to keep working Im giving it two months to see if I can eek out some kind of schedule that works for me. I think you should at least try especially if you havent before. The truth is you wont know until you do.

2727726,0,t1_cnd7av4,gtI went a bit through your post history and read a lot of what you have said to various people and despite a bit too much doctor worshiping  I am only using that term because I dont have a better one no offense please you have been very fortunate to have clearly been involved with some great doctors who have helped you tremendously. gtJust understand that some of us have a massive disdain for doctors and the systems surrounding medical that you may be more forgiving of if you have experienced it or have been fortunate enough not to experience it at all. While I certainly would prefer another term I get your point about doctor worshipping I am undoubtedly sometimes guilty of being overly enthusiastic or appreciative of doctors. But Ive not been spared my fair share of horrible experiences and met the whole gamut of that profession from the most professional and caring to the most reckless and inhumane. I have no doubt my opinion would be very different had I met only with the latter end of that spectrum. And while my local health care system is a beaurocratic monster and pretty expensive it is known to be rather good and Ive never lost my insurance either. That certainly makes a difference.So Im fully aware that Im biased by my own personal experience here. Ive often been lucky in these regards I dont expect you or others who havent been that lucky to share my level of appreciation as I said already.But still I think showing some level of appreciation is simply a matter of humility. You can take pride in your achievements without pretending that you had no help whatsoever. You can hate the system despise doctors and still acknowledge that without any medication and medical support at all few of us would be still be alive and even fewer would enjoy that life. Just like you can hate your government and resent most politicians without denying the fact that living in a democracy has many perks. No need to go all blackandwhite were not here to win a fight but to have a discussion.gtA lot of us myself included have found ways of battling and holding C.F. at bay without spending all of our time in P.T. on pulmozyne on I.V.s and lessening our quality of lives day to day. I dont want you to think I sit around at home thinking everything about my health is great I understand it isnt a lot of it is very very shitty. I work everyday between my wife and myself to figure out what I can do that wont make every day miserable for me and I have so far been really successful at it. I get the impression that doctors have very much been the answer for you for a ton of shit it just is not the case for all of us.I never doubted that you spend a great deal of effort and care on preserving your health and that youre not delusional about your health.But you almost make it sound as if people like me are eager doing all that P.T. inhalers I.V.s and stuff. As if we somehow choose the easier path just following doctors orders and passively getting cared for while you are bold and strong enough to think outside the box get proactive and take matters into your own hands...If it werent for our previous conversation I would be really tempted to go all sarcastic here. But I know this isnt your intention and Ill just state for the record that this isnt the correct impression someone have about me or my background. Doctors werent the answer. Hell I wish some doctors wouldve at least tried to make it sound like they were. In truth Ive never found that answer nor did my doctors. All that treatment medical intervention and heavy medication barely managed to slow my continuous decline a few more years. But while you seem to think that these efforts somehow lessened my quality of life usually the opposite was true. Most times IV antibiotics werent a burden I dreaded but a gift I awaited. One that could restore some of that quality of life infections and exacerbations kept taking away from me. Still just like a drug addict having a relapse having to resort to this kind of treatment felt like a defeat every time. Seeing a doctor wasnt just about getting a new prescription or being delivered bad news again. It was about not facing that battle alone about knowing that there was someone more experienced fighting alongside me. And doing P.T. and nebulizer treatments wasnt just a waste of time on the contrary. Without those treatments my entire day wouldve been spent coughing. And it was a way to do something at all even long after exercise had become impossible to put up some kind of fight still.I didnt want to rely on drugs and doctors. Perhaps I wouldve choosen a similiar path as you did but before I could try my condition had already reached a point where I was grateful for any help I could get and where I had no delusions left about how my life would turn out without medical support.,CysticFibrosis,cne4q32,2,t5_2r876

When I first heard it I just kinda shrugged it off I thought yeah I can have unprotected sex she doesnt have to take the pill and no baby! Now only  years later I do wish I could have the ability to have a child not that I want one yet though.My story sounds the same to yours very little liquid in comparison to what you see well on the internet... Then I had the test and yeah infertile unless I have treatment.I think I may hear a rather biased opinion by posting here however I have a question to the ladies..If you were with a guy who could not give you a child naturally how would that make you feel?

3151625,0,t1_conw0y4,Id say thats pretty fair. I do enjoy hanging out with my friends when I can. Were all very goofy together and have a lot of silly fun. Its hard to divide the time amongst everything but I manage it one way or another.As for scared... well no I guess Im not really that worried. I cant really say as to why Im not. Ive always been a go with the flow kind of guy and happy go lucky as others tend to say. I get down sometimes but its fairly rare. I think I look at it as another part of lifes experience. Theres not a whole lot I can do other than what I already am. So it seems better to just relax and see where everything leads. Every experience leads to new appreciations on the things I can do or the things I used to be able to do. Something I do tend to do is talk to myself about things though as I am laying in bed. Which probably sounds strange. haha But I lay there talking out loud thinking about the things that need done and what to do if such and such happens or when an appointment is etc. What medicines need reordered and what all needs cleaned soon. Id be lying if I said it wasnt a little depressing sometimes. And sometimes I can be mad and annoyed because its just not fair. But in the end feeling that way doesnt accomplish anything and it doesnt change anything. So I tend to let those feelings go as they arent going to help me any.I certainly hope your lungs keep going for a while! No lung collapses or any of that.  ,CysticFibrosis,coonw4f,2,t5_2r876

Keep unused ampules in the protective foil pouch. Pulmozyme should be kept refrigerated during transport. Combined lengths of exposure of the medication to room temperature should not exceed  hours.Ive heard good thing about Frio cooling pouches however its generally just to keep insulin from overheating as insulin can be good at room temperature for about a month. Will you have access to a fridge every day or ice? A lunchbox with freezable walls like this could be useful.

6297455,0,t1_cz4z3rb,Ive tried all three options. First before anyone jumps down my throat yes I understand the risks and that Im gambling with my health. Im not here for a lecture. So! Edibles are the safest way period. Theres no question about that. Youre not putting anything into your respiratory system so its a win win. My problem with edibles as previously mentioned is that its difficult to dose and can get quite expensive if youre making them yourself. I can really hungry when I ingest edibles and its a goof pain reliever. Side note you can save your already vaped weed and use that to make edibles with.Vaping has its risks again as mentioned mold fungus etc is inhaled. Its also important to consider what your vaporizer is made of. A vape with glass parts is going to be easier to clean without getting as many micro abrasions than say plastic. Another option is to use a vape through a bubbler or bong to further filter things it will never filter everything but it helps. Finally smoking. Smoking of any kind is not recommended for someone with CF but ultimately its a personal choice. Joints in my opinion are the worst. Not only are you inhaling all the carcinogens youre also inhaling whatever the papers are made from. If smoking is the prefered method and you really dont want anything else try to use a bong. A bit of filtering is better than  nothing.In conclusion I enjoy weed quite a bit. It helps me cough up junk I can otherwise and its keeping my weight steady via the muchies. Be responsible listen to your body and definitely listen to doctors and those close to yous concerns.,CysticFibrosis,cz5g6rc,3,t5_2r876

I wouldnt mind my husband explaining things honestly especially if I chose to stay in the room with everyone.,CysticFibrosis,d82cg2o,4,t5_2r876

9973091,0,t3_5ibbu1,I was speaking to the research wing at my clinic about this. Apparently the leukocytes are caustic and thus a negative cycle of inflammation in the lungs with little to no reversal. One research coordinator mentioned this study as well as an experimental concentrated nonpsychoactive thc molecule for reduced inflammation. I hope to get on the phase two trial. Its my next goal.,CysticFibrosis,db7irh7,2,t5_2r876
10486765,0,t3_5q4ja4,Totally understand what youre expressing. Although feeling like I have cf has always been a part of my life. I was diagnosed at  and have always been on nebulizers. Mypancreas has so far never been an issue. Hopefully it stays that way. I guess there are two ways to approach this my empathic side wants to hold your hand and say itll be alright...but my approach to cf has always been realistic. And I feel youll be better served if I speak plainly. As much as it sucks you need to get used to these new treatments. As much as it sucks there will be IVs weird lab results with uncertain meaning and youll lose lung function. How that impacts your life is entirely up to you. Obviously when you get bad news there is a period where you process it all. But after that point you can either keep feeling anxiety and sorrow over this or you can fight like hell to stay healthy for as long as you can. My lung function is in the s and I fight like hell everyday. In grade schoolhigh school I naturally rebelled like lots of kids some slacking off etc but luckily my parents simply didnt allow me to skip meds. Not a single one. Not a single pill. Not a single vest treatment. I dont know where Id be if they had not rode my ass all those years. and thanks to that experience I am  compliant and committed to doing everything in my power. So you can keep denying whats going on or just take some time to reflect and decide that maybe the road ahead will be a little bumpier but youre strong and ready to handle it. Handling it is a relative term because CF patients all have unique experiences with their disease. Im not saying this will be easy so I definitely echo what someone else said about seeking a professionals help. Think of himher like a life coach. Someone to talk to when youre feeling low. You dont need to do it all yourself and I hope family and friends will step in too. As for where you mentioned relationships dont let your cf ruin that. Ive known my husband for  years and weve been married for . Just like any other relationship there are good and bad times challenges etc. that is not a cf specific issue. Besides people get blindsided by disease and illness all the time. They have no warning and neither do their spouses. You actually have an advantage to already know your condition. It may not feel that way but having a serious illness gives you perspective. The only thing I will say is to simply be honest if you get involved with someone so they have the full story. Hopefully that didnt come off as too harsh that isnt my intention. But cf can be hard life can be hard and youre strong enough to take it on. But again you dont have to take it on alone. ,CysticFibrosis,dcws8m2,3,t5_2r876

Ive had a few surgeries in my life and coming out I felt like complete garbage. So something like a lung transplant is likely a million times more painful that heart surgery because at least my ribcage wasnt sawed. But at the same time IDK I take my meds seriously and lack of compliance rubs me the wrong way. So sorry if it came off rude or offensive.Thankfully my boyfriends sister is tough when it comes to meds so she pretty much tells them not taking their meds isnt an option.,CysticFibrosis,ddf39aa,1,t5_2r876

10708371,0,t3_5savf9,I got a transplant  weeks ago. I can walk and breathe now but my chest feels like someone is sitting on it and squeezing it really tightly because of the nerve damage from the surgery and its really depressing me.I can no longer sleep on my side because of the weird sensations from the nerve damage and every morning when I wake up it takes hours to get used to how gross it feels.Also when I take deep breaths it feels like my lungs arent expending very far because of the nerves but Im sure they are my saturation is ! and if I exert myself and my heart beats really fast it feels like Im having a heart attack because of how numb and weird everything is.So ya life is great but the nerve damage is really depressing me.

11054877,0,t1_del0844,gt I know its scary but can you describe what you mean by this? My interventional radiologist told me Youre just kind of lucky that you havent died so far this can kill you and will probably be your immediate cause of death.From the extensive research I have made which yielded little results it seems that an haemoptysis can be considered massive when the amount of blood spilled is around the ml. It also seems that this event is associated with a very high mortality not only at the moment of occurrence but there is also a significant gt mortality rate within two years from such one episode. These studies are however rather old and Id say they are outdated after all in the s life expectancy for us was dramatically lower than what it is today. Still this doesnt mean that this occurrence isnt extremely serious. Here are a couple of sourcesa shorter one a more comprehensive in depth study also about tranexamic acid usage gt One of my most recent ones wasnt the bloodiest but it took ten freaking minutes...real live minutes to quick. Twice it happened so violently that blood came out of my nose from the flow of it and when I reflexively inhaled from the coughing breathed in blood and started to pass out like I was drowning in it.gt I didnt even know it was a thing for us on that level till it started happening to me. Most stuff just says respiratory failure like you struggle for air a few times and claw at stuff and then ship out. Or you cant exhale and breathe in your own CO and breathe your own vomit when you puke from poisoning yourself.Ive had these episodes for well over five years now but until I had it happen in front of a pneumologist no one had been able to tell me what the hell was going on. Or rather I believe that until a doctor saw it with its own eyes and put it on paper no one ever believed me. It seems doctors dont believe that you can spend several minutes my record being about  continuously gushing out blood. But we do and indeed it is extremely gorey... my mom usually needs to just sit down or shell pass out just by looking at all the blood hahaha. Its a huge mess. When it happens I just get into survival mode I ask someone if there is someone around that is to pop open a couple of tranexamic acid vials drink them and then just cough it all out as hard as I can so I dont drown and also so that I dont have much blood left in the lungs when its over because it is an ideal habitat for bacterias. Every time I just hope that it will stop at some point but you never know. I guess weve been both very lucky so far. Ive never fainted but I did go semiblind a couple of times. One of the times I just had me taken to the hospital and by when I was there I had filled a large plastic shopping bag with blood. They went nuts and put me straight on the interventional radiologist for an emergency embolization. I also have CF related liver disease with a cirrhotic liver a spleen the size of three normal ones and very low platelet count basically I dont coagulate on my own. Hence all the tranexamic acid and K vitamin I take.But at the end of the day there isnt a proven  guaranteed solution to this problem. Tranexamic acid can help but its not guaranteed to and can have side issues. Selective embolizations should help in theory but Ive had four and they did nothing for me. Everyone knows its the bronchiectasises and scarring of the lungs that are just beyond recovery and unless stem cells or some other discovery leads to thorough lung tissue repair I doubt well see this solved. We are an extreme minority of people according to the study I linked before its just one in one hundred CF patients that ever has a massive haemoptysis and  of all massive haemoptysis are CF patients so yeah... not a big patient population.,CysticFibrosis,del1vdd,2,t5_2r876
11097896,0,t3_5yfyob,Sorry to hear about what you have been through we had something similar the ray of hope where by our daughter double df did not sweat so we ended up have sweat tests every  days for close to  weeks before they finally got one with enough sweat. Our consultant advised us that the sweat test was the official way to diagnose CF even though she has a double mutation as the genetics are still finding new things out such as other genes that counter the CF genes etc so although they were . that she had CF which she does they needed the sweat test. After so many visits we started to think perhaps maybe she did not have it... The call was expected but still a knock back as the ray of hope has crept in. However to add to this a condition like CF is nothing like it used to be our daughter is  is on th percentile for weight and th for height has only had one stay in hospital and is a little fighter yes it will affect her but most of what happens now adays is preventative and really is really good.I hope that your ray of hope actually turns out to be true ,CysticFibrosis,depxqkn,1,t5_2r876

11158544,0,t3_5y5akf,First of all cf shouldnt deter you from dating. Thats an excuse that a lot of people with cf use because its easier to not try. Sure it feels that way but there are lots of people with all sorts of ailments some more serious than ours who find a partner to share love with. We are social beings and anyone with or without an illness who denies themselves social contact andor intimate contact will not be too happy. We all need it. So try not to think that you have to hide behind cf and use it a shield against human contact.  I think about what Id be like if I didnt have cf. A lot! Mostly because I was only diagnosed at  years old so I do remember a life without cf. I was very different. I had goals I wanted to go to university I was ambitious I was a great person. After my diagnosis   years ago I thought I wouldnt live to see  so I went a totally different route in my life. I lived a lot and very fast and had a lot of fun but I also sacrificed my health in the process because I didnt know better. ,CysticFibrosis,dewt4ub,1,t5_2r876
