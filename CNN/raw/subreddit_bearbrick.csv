6864935,0,t1_czrapx0,Your collection is awesome. Could you give me the list of US and Canadian dealers you know of and use? Yea most of them are limited just cause they are not the easiest thing to get and keep in stock. I just dont like eBay cause I dont want to get stuck with a fake or something. I did find CJMart and liked their options. Mindzai was another but they have high prices.,bearbrick,d0ug8pi,1,t5_2x06b
