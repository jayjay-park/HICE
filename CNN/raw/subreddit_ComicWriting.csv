174839,0,t1_cexti03,That is so awesome! I think that so much of comic writing has to do with the Page as an increment. When you have a firm grasp on what youre able to do with it you become unstoppable! Taking control of time and space is something that a lot of people dream about and as a comic writer you have that ability!! Its exciting for me to think about it that way at least haha!,ComicWriting,ceycj6l,1,t5_2t6dd

Instead of this happened and this happened. ,ComicWriting,cfm5t3g,1,t5_2t6dd
572585,0,t1_cg4801i,Hey thank you so much for taking the time to give feedback. Its vital right now as were just starting out getting things figured out. I agree that the first pages work well without dialogue and more of the comic could function in the same way. The thing is Im just enjoying writing the dialogue so much and I think it will get better too. I will probably try to limit it though so that much of the story is told through the imagery. Thank you again and stay tuned! ,ComicWriting,cg5cw45,1,t5_2t6dd

2960075,0,t3_2tok3g,I think it really depends on the relationship with the artist. For example a movie script formatting style would suit a writerartist relationship with a strong collaborative vocal aspect. So lets say you speak and communicate consistently. your vaguely outlined script can become very detailed in person. It can leave the artist holding the buck on research and filling in writer gaps. It very much can depend. ,ComicWriting,co4kp2m,1,t5_2t6dd

3407905,0,t3_2yqske,So first I like it. There isnt a lot of stuff like this on this sub and I think this is pretty neat. Im not really sure if it necessitated two pages but all in all it was pretty fun. My only comment is that on the first page I think you could get the same beats with one less panel. That last panel isnt super necessary and I think the caption from it could just get pushed to the other panel and have a similar rhythm. I might be wrong though as I like the slow summer day kind of feeling. Also and this isnt so much a critique as a personal feeling. I kind of thought the ending was anti climactic. I like the bit about calling the wrong person I just felt the last line didnt strike me the right way. Is it supposed to be a pun? I feel like the stuff before it is a better ending place. Like ending with the phone hanging up or whatever. ,ComicWriting,cpgq5s7,1,t5_2t6dd
3805794,0,t3_33z94a,It sounds really interesting and I like uFyreFlus idea with heading above the ash clouds.I recommend that you read Pride of Baghdad by Brian K. Vaughn.

Maybe it is like this for everybody but I feel like we have a lot of fun and it feels natural for us to come up with concept plot ideas and arcs but where I really feel myself getting bogged down is in grind of pacing dialogue and those types of thing the actual writing part I guess haha.

6664528,0,t3_45sf3n,Id say too much direction but thats just me. I prefer to describe the scene off the bat and then write only dialogue so that the artist can choose the panelling and how to depict the characters as they speak as they choose. Giving the angling especially would really limit the artist. The dialogue doesnt feel like a real interaction between two people. I cant say if the character is likeable or not since we only meet him for about four pages.,ComicWriting,d08o4bm,2,t5_2t6dd

Theres a chart somewhere about different page rates but you cant put much stock in that. gt Am I using the right script format?It doesnt really matter. As long as its clearly defined whats in the panels and where the pages end. Make sure to communicate with your artist to make the process easy on both of you. gt Do I need to have my characters drawn out before I hire an artist?You can if you want but most people have the same artist design their character and draw the comic. ,ComicWriting,d18x2b2,3,t5_2t6dd
7107606,0,t1_d1gpnt7,I love this dont saturate your story with origin just present clues and let the reader connect the dots. More importantly dont force your characters to go into an origin without a really good reason for it dont make the reader feel like the character is explaining things to himher. Personally Im writing a scifi comedy action so as a way to avoid doing this I threw in some magazine ads such as Centari Spark soda pop or Department of Sentient Relief Reach Out for like a donation cause just funny little adverts peppered throughout the story so the reader can easily comprehend my universe without forcing it down their throat. ,ComicWriting,d1m0ty5,1,t5_2t6dd
7289720,0,t3_4f8j4p,I just finished my first script and sent it off to my artist on thursday so im no expert but Ill share some of my obstacles and failures.First off I only got into comics about  or  years ago. Ive had a few here or there mostly because they were the source material for movies I love like  Days of Night Watchmen and Hellboy. I started branching out a little bit reading more and more. Ive always considered myself to be a storyteller. Ive always had ideas for stories and started writing them in various mediums but I alaways gave up for one reason or another. As I grew to love comics it became clear to me that this aas another form of media I could use. I first came up with a story called The Fear Eaters a issue horror story. This one is my favorite but Im inexperienced with comics so it has been shelved until I feel capable to do it justice.So I started off small. I just wrote a short page comic a horror story called Monsters and Madmen. I started writing it a year ago and it was originally supposed to be much longer. There was originally  seperate tales that intertwined and culminated into a earthshattering ending. The concept was good but in the end it was too bland. Pacing was terrible and there seemed to be a lot of filler. After a few months of trying to improve it and make it work I scrapped it and took bits and peices for a smaller story and it flowed much MUCH better. I figured that condensing a story was the best thing you could do for it. Then when it came to scripting I realized I had too much action in some parts and not enough in others. There was a point when  out of  pages had  or  panels. While it was still fast and the story moved quickly for these action sequences it might be to difficult for the artist to pull off. So condensing isnt necessarily the best thing.You want the story snappy enough to keep the reader intrigued from panel to  panel but you also need to leave some breathing room. Dont let the action sequences drag on too long but dont have too many lulls between those sequences either.TLDR Pacing was my biggest enemy. ,ComicWriting,d26sivl,2,t5_2t6dd

8658465,0,t3_4yhra1,Outlines are generally independent of the medium. The story is the story.Only when you choose a medium do you need to edit down or flesh out the outline to meet the mediums requirementsrestrictions. pages is a fairly robust outline. If this is your first time out of the gate odds are its not written very efficiently. I dont know your work of course but newer writers tend to overwrite at the outline stage.Also  pt single spaced means its actually longer than  probably a lot longer. This is one of the reasons why you should always work in a standard pt courier double spaced format.  That said theres nothing to say  pages wont work out for a  page book.Now whether you want to be tackling a monster  page graphic novel hours a day  page pencils hours to pencil hour weeks or  months worth of work... is a whole other story.Id recommend going through your outline and breaking out a scene list. Scenes can be long or short but seeing how many scenes you have overall is tellingand you really need the scene list anyway when you start writing so...Keep us posted.Write on write often!

Overall I liked it clean easy to read and got a chuckle from me. I was actually pretty amazed that you managed to make something so readable considering how many panels you used. I have less of a criticism and more of a suggestion I would try getting rid of the panels   . I think they add to the chaotic nature of the comic in a good way but maybe with that space you could set up the little joke at the end better.
