151965,0,t3_1vtgvw,I guess my suggestions arent textbooks but I have been trying to branch out my leisure reading into books about the human body.  The story of the Human Body by D. Lieberman is what Im making my way through now. He touches on the evolution of the human body with a focus on anatomy and kinesiology changes. One I cant recommend enough is Born to Run by Chris McDougall Its about a guys journey into the world of supermarathon runners and also talks the philosophy behind running. ,Kinesiology,cevqnpl,1,t5_2vaa4

5624064,0,t1_cwu71m6,Cool thanks for the pointers. Yeah Im mostly concerned with whether or not the masters is worth it. Im sure it looks better to the employers but I also know you can be hired as a ex phys without going to grad school for it.  I also thought you had to get one of those ACSM or ASEP certifications even if going to grad school but I guess not after hearing your case.  Thanks again. Im looking into applying to LIU Brooklyns program which has an ex phys concentration within their M.S. Exercise Science program,Kinesiology,cwu7vty,1,t5_2vaa4

8333085,0,t3_4t6a6w,Hows the decision process going? I thought Id chip in my perspective as well since I am in a similar situation to you. Took a gap year after graduating with a degree in Kinesiology and have been planning on going to PT school since freshman year. Im one year out and my friends making good money with a Kin degree are working full time as personal trainers at high end health clubs. Its honestly a great job if you are truly passionate about training and working with the general population. They make session depending on how long theyve been at the club so there are opportunities to make good money in training. I got into PT school and Ill start in the fall. Ive definitely had some of the same reservations about going into school again. I have a background in personal training and did the PT aide thing too for a while. I decided to attend despite having to take on some debt because I do really want to be able to help with the injury rehab side. My personal training clients would usually have some sort of injury when I first met them and we couldnt get it to resolve so I needed to refer them to a PT before we could continue. Being able to fill that gap in the continuity of their care was really important to me and I know I will feel fulfilled doing that kind of work even though I do find it boring at times. The question I asked myself about getting a DPT was why do I really want it over any other healthcare or fitness profession? If you want it more for the background knowledge for training I dont think you would be happy at the end of it IMO. I dont think you will get as much information to use with your clients as you think since the goal of all PT schools is to graduate you as a generalist where you will only have a quarter or two doing classes related to outpatient orthopedics. There are tons of other avenues to get more continuing education that would be relevant for personal training which is also wayyy cheaper. There are membership sites run by PTs and chiros you could access for about yr who produce great content if you are into the injury rehab side. You could go do more certifications or attend clinics for experts in areas of training you are interested in. You could even go back and do a masters in exercise physiology which would definitely go way more in depth in the physiology of training and I bet it would still be cheaper than a DPT. One of the guys at my university was in the grad program but was also the strength and conditioning coach for some of the varsity sports teams. But if you do have a passion for injury rehab then you definitely need to go back to school because that is the only way you can practice in the US. There are ways to minimize the amount of debt you have to take on apply to local schools dont apply to a ton of schools the fees add up really quick I spent k applying to  schools working and saving money beforehand scholarships working in school some programs offer GATA positions with pay or a stipend living with a family memberfriend who will let you live there for cheap etc. What specifically are you interested in sales? My understanding of medicalfitness sales is that is a huge industry and there are probably a ton of very different jobs that could fit that description. Honestly I think most PT schools are pretty much the same in the sense you graduate with the same degree and have to pass the same test and you are considered a generalist. Its not like law school where youll make more money if you go to a top school. Things to consider might be professor research interests school teaching style access to cadaver lab student to teacher ratio PRICE cost of living in the town ability to work as a GA clinical affiliations. Anyways that was a pretty long ramble but hopefully it will be some food for thought for you. I definitely dont think your ideas are farfetched or at least I hope not because mine are similar!,Kinesiology,d5j6vws,2,t5_2vaa4
8406306,0,t3_4t6a6w,Any update from OP on your decision? Im in the exact same boat. Kinesiology degree . gpa have my CSCS and do small group training. Im looking in to corporate wellness as I have a lot of internship experience in the industry.,Kinesiology,d5sc0z1,1,t5_2vaa4
8977383,0,t1_d7qtb5f,Now that Im thinking more.... Is the Kin college creating a Masters program to compete with the Athletic Therapists? From what I remember from past discussion Might just be hearsay is that the Masters program is being created to specialize kins... for example have a on fieldemergency care specialization which would include more in depths taping and on field injury assessments and a more clinical side with a closer look at assessments and injury rehab...,Kinesiology,d7qy19r,1,t5_2vaa4
