327719,0,t3_1xuhfa,My message to Jagex I was made aware that I would get double keys upon purchasing keys for Treasure Hunter so purchased . I have since used the keys purchased but Im sure you will be able to see I actually made the purchase. Id just like to know why I didnt receive the extra keys?                                    Their response Hey Hoshigaki Thanks for getting in touch with us. Mod TeaBan here to help.  Its great to hear that you have grabbed some Keys Hoshigaki.  Ive taken a look at your account and I can see that you have grabbed Keys on the th of February . As for the Double Keys it seems that you havent received your extra keys this is due to some bugs on grabbing keys. However I have gone ahead and added the extra keys you were supposed to get.

It could be recast indefinitely in this manner resulting in quick experience however this spell no longer gives experience for missing.gtImage igtImage igtInteresting Curse | Magic | Enfeeble | Skeleton Mage Mage Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcreou oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecreou.
