576682,0,t3_20otau,Hey there Although HomeTreeMine doesnt have a whitelist to join we have almost everything youre looking for! Its a pvp survival minecraft server with extremely few plugins. Currently the only thing that makes this server semi vanilla is home tpa and land claims to protect against griefing. Some of the plugins are also customwritten by Erictron but most of the protection plugins should be familiar. All of the staff on this server are around  years old so were very easy to communicate with and fun to be around. The nether resets every month so players dont run out of resources and there are donation ranks although the server is completely playable without donating. HomeTreeMine is under a week old however we have about  players on during out peak times. The community is fairly closeknit and youll find that the people that play come from very diverse backgrounds. We have top of the line anticheat plugins and observant staff to keep the gameplay fair. I am seriously hoping that this server  will grow and continue in its success. Check us out if this server sounds appealing to you! mc.hometreemine.com I made a YouTube review here as well Thanks!,mcservers,cg5tn7s,1,t5_2s3kg

I personally like hcf which you can find on us.shotbow.net or the kohi version kohi.us the shotbow version has a longer deathban that can go up too three days but the kohi version has a smaller deathban and currently more players.

How long have you played Minecraft for  Since Octoboer th  How long do you play in a typical session  Depends on whats going on around away from the screen. Is my girlfriend around I put my attention on her when shes not around I usually spend a few hours from time to time during a day at Minecraft.  Do you play or have you played on other servers  Yes I have played on other server plenty. For now I am not playing on any server for a silly reason. If yes why did you leave the last server you played on  I didnt I got banned for killing the Ender Dragon by myself. Apparently its cheating and hacking even though you have maxed out OP armour after XP farming. He went crazy and blew up my base and everything Ive done. There was no way to reason with the kid so therefore I will never apply to a  age limit server. How many chickens is too many?!

3451128,0,t3_2z6a5u,Questions Would a YouTube Series be made from this? What is the general age demographic? I see  in the apps below. What kind of people are you looking for for this? If a YouTube series is to be made are videos mandatory?Heres my application anyway. Ghost. Im . Been in the game since Beta ... I usually play modded but thats because single player vanilla gets boring. Id like to play SMP vanilla with others.. One ban on a creative server. Griefing. I punched a few holes in the bed rock to see if I could in the area was all. Was banned for it. . If allowed I would plan to make a YouTube series out of it. Id like to get into the commentating part of YouTube. I would CoLab with other players on projects and with their consent record and post it.The most Ive done in Vanilla is home building on small scales and low level farms. Ive longed for a chance to build bigger better and greater though but Ive never had the time or patients. With others along my side it would be a lot more fun.,mcservers,cplnlvt,1,t5_2s3kg

3659849,0,t1_cq99u9i,Not to defend Adam because we all know how Gioboi turned out in the end and he made his mistakes. We all did on the staff but Relentless was made with new ideals and desires. The staff have worked very hard to keep Adam and the server in line this time around and have been it a point to keep donations to be as pure to the heart of one simple thing keep Relentless from being PW. This has gone on such a strict notice for the main staff that we have out right denied Adam doing anything that could even be considered pay to win. ask him about it if you like i think he still grits his teeth for it sometimes For that reason alone I will defend Relentless.Simple fact of the matter is that we founded Relentless as server completely different and separate from Gioboi because we knew the name had earned a reputation. Told you so Adam... We wanted players to know that we were going to found a new server with different standards than before which is why cast aside the old name and even set aside the past issues with people just to make that point. With that in mind I dont ask that you take you post down but make a point to let others know that yes we fucked up the first time around but we are doing so much better this time and while its true we even now make mistakes we are still working out the kinks seems there are always news around every fix but thats why we have such dedicated staff to keep on fixing the bugs and issues. I dont know who you are but there is no reason for you slander the name of this server because its owner made mistakes even you have made some mistakes I know that for a fact so what gives you the right to call anyone else out on theirs? Especially in such a public setting and worst of all anonymously...  ,mcservers,cq9g5aa,2,t5_2s3kg

11665091,0,t3_66eoqy,Hey there! You may like Sunflower Kingdom.Were a whitelisted community server with around  players currently whitelisted with around  online at once. Were a very tightknit community and love to interact and mess about!Our server has players from all around the world Australia Lebanon UK Sweden Croatia Moldova Canada Brazil etc. and we like to think of ourselves as a varied community. The age range of the server is  with a lot of players being in their twenties.We used to be completely vanilla but we now have one mod Realistic Terrain Generation. This mod changes how the terrain is generated so that it looks more appealing and realistic. Nothing else in the game is changed. However we understand that this is not for everyone. If you would like more information just ask or Google the mod name The server is intended to run as a democracy. This means that any decisions made on the server are voted and discussed by the community. If the majority of the server do not want to go ahead with an idea such as a map change then we do not do it. Myself and other staff members do not have more of a say than other players. We are all equal here.Weve got another server used for weekly events such as UHC Race for the Wool Capture the Flag Building Game etc. which a lot of the server community participates in.We also have a very active Discord server which most of the server uses for communication. In addition to this we also have a forum for applying discussions games...pretty much everything and anything.To apply head over to  and go to the application section. Applying should be fairly straightforward from there I hope to see you on the server but if this server is not for you then I hope you find the server you are looking for ,mcservers,dgi94hv,2,t5_2s3kg
