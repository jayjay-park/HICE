125732,0,t3_1vinit,Well someone just posted a link to a  dollar swimbait. You could try that one out haha. The only real experience Ive had with swimbaits are the super cheap storm ones. ,tacklebox,cesqz9v,6,t5_2zm7g
319660,0,t3_1xgcxa,Hey Perry! Post dem pics man! But yeah the FC Sniper is great Ive heard! Youve used my lb InvizX but its really stiff and full of memory let alone  or lb! You could always try out a different braid for a change if youre just looking for a change. Izorline is supposed to be great and so is Tufline XP and Sunline FX! ,tacklebox,cfdwhn2,2,t5_2zm7g

1876380,0,t1_ckf9m4k,With my set up absolutely. My Stradic is was rod broke heart broke. a  medium light fast action G Loomis GL spooled with lb Power Pro Super Slick. This set up could throw any inshore lure youd ever think useful. Im assuming youve spooled your Stradic with high quality line since youve spent the money on the reel. If you havent I highly recommend you do. I have no idea how light the Medium Light Mojo Inshore will be as Ive never held it. The G Loomis ML feels extremely light in comparison with my M Mojo inshore so perhaps its heavier than what Im expecting. If this is the case you may have a hard time throwing lures such as Spook Jrs into winds or over long distances. Do you have the FJ or CI?,tacklebox,ckfap5y,1,t5_2zm7g

4540241,0,t1_ct2w58h,So far its just one of those cheap china lures that Ive had to repaint. A cheap spoon that the paint chipped off of almost entirely after one single pike. Mind you Ive bought expensive wobblers from wellknown companies that are also in need of some touch up.Regarding those cheap China lures if you stay away from the absolute cheapest wobblers and any spinner youll be all right. I got these for example and they work perfectly fine. The joint might need some nail polish or glue to seal the hole where the small stick holding the parts together is put but other than that they work like a charm!,tacklebox,ct2xcx5,1,t5_2zm7g

6998878,0,t1_d192r65,I remember I used to get pumped for them. Especially for blackberries and other tech. Even  or  years ago if you got a spy shot of a product there was about a  chance that you could actually figure out what you were looking at. It was fun speculating and seeing some people get the product early and do an unboxing. Now if something leaks theres usually a library of pictures with perfect clarity and its already been perfectly reproduced by some company overseas. ,tacklebox,d19o04t,0,t5_2zm7g
