9901861,0,t1_day06wx,gt You can prevent crusade by using an inquisitor. I believe crusade also works for you attacking them I could be wrong please correct me if thats true.OK but if youre going to argue that  players should have a strong enough religious presence to negate crusade then shouldnt there be a benefit for  players all have a chance at religion? gt but there are modifiers all over that give bonuses and I dont think lowering these to lets say  is an improvement.I dont see a reason for it being in the game personally. I was interested in what the modders believe is the correct course of action. ,fruitymod,day8hkl,1,t5_3eq34
