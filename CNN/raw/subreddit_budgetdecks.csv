4721236,0,t1_ctpn96y,For myself as long as I played my deck the best I can if my opponent beats me it just means I have more room for improvement. I do agree these deck are too expensive to be called real budget decks trust me I would not build these decks because of how expensive they are they could be considered by some to be budget decks for tournament play. Although I think it is better to lose to a cheap jank deck because it allows me to see a new deck I may not of see before! ,budgetdecks,ctpngap,2,t5_34hmk
4899527,0,t1_cuc2hv8,I am not entirely sure how it works so I went with discard as it seamed more common place and can pretty much handle every other archetype out there. After all everyone relies on combinations and discarding throws a major spanner into those works ,budgetdecks,cuc4hcl,1,t5_34hmk

7378852,0,t1_d2gvuno,Psychosis Crawler is a good call definitely a sweet alternate win condition for the deck.  I actually wanted to avoid cards that gave me an infinite hand size because by discarding lands every turn I could rip through  extra cards every turn.And yeah Crop Rotation is a good call for sure.,budgetdecks,d2gxa8k,2,t5_34hmk

7764825,0,t3_4kdvn4,Know your card shop by this I mean know the staff and what their products are. My local store sells singles that are any rarity so some are really cheap but other stores only sell expensive singles so if you dont know ask your card shop. You could also spend like  dollars and get an intro pack which is preconstructed and has some pretty decent cards in it. What is your price range?,budgetdecks,d3ossp1,1,t5_34hmk
9726444,0,t3_5eelna,So because historically this deck has little to no carddraw you dont want lands. That said you should as quickly as possible trade into fetches. Faithless looting is a creative alternative until then.    Part of the reason the deck is consistent is because it cycles for free. Maxing out on street wraiths or adding more gitaxian probes will help. If you cant getfind those check this link for cheap cyclers  Also this is a spells matters deck. The valroz combo is cool ive always wanted to play it but because scavenge is only at sorcery speed and Valroz costs  its kinda too slow. Id switch to Become Immense Vines of Vastwood or Blossoming Defense might of old krosa or giant growth.    I think any combination of the changes above will help your deck run smoother. ,budgetdecks,dabzxb2,3,t5_34hmk

10654936,0,t1_dded1z8,I mean its not gonna win a Modern pro tour or something but that seems super solid IMO. Manabase could use a little work but after a few games youll get a feel for oh I need a little more green or oh my white is a little much,budgetdecks,ddez3mz,2,t5_34hmk

10941447,0,t3_5w95zq,hungry flames has no place in modern play searing blaze its just better.I dont see any reason to play shock either sawp it for Skullcrack spark elemental something that deals at least  damage same goes for wild slashTitans strength with only  creatures seems absolutely god awful swap it for a burn spell that deals at least  damage like perhaps shard volleywhen it comes to burn spells tha magic numbers are  damage for  or less cmc and at  cmc you want spells that deal  damage like flames of the blood hand If youre playing a deck full of shock effects you will have to cast  spells to win the game making your chances of even goldfishing a turn  win pretty low,budgetdecks,de8j7bg,1,t5_34hmk

11676882,0,t3_66lc2i,Definitely need more infectors Necropede isnt bad for budget lists.  If youre willing to have a few colorless lands that come in tapped Cathedral of War can be a good exalted enabler that isnt noble hierarch.  Also should really consider Blossoming Defense since spot removal is abundant and very scary for infect.   ,budgetdecks,dgjlacv,1,t5_34hmk
