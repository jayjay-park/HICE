285394,0,t3_1xdc7f, Byamaru  In the end it was in the hands of the murderer and it was destroyed. With the flavor text experiment leading to the conclusion that the flavor text of an item will affect the user. I guess this means everyone should keep an eye on what they use. Gotta say though Akatsukis HaganemushiTatara left a tear in my eye. Definitely a great weapon.  Another Tea Party  It is kind of funny how it is Akatsukis turn to have a tea party and grow as a person considering Shiroes past adventures. Overskill  In a way overskill is just the advance usage of previously existing skills which is kind of neat. Akatsuki now has her own Shadow Clones and we see some other uses such as flying through the air with the Kanagis barriers. In a way Shiroes contract which finally appears in the anime in the next episode is another kind of Overskill. Rather than calling it Overskill Id think it be better to refer to it as something like Original Skill.  Next Time  I cant wait until Volume  starts to get translated. Things to keep in mind include. Shiroes Death. Threats from other continents.. Western Threats. Akiba no longer has a defense system.. Shiroe is located in another city considering he doesnt respawn at Akiba..

1224918,0,t1_ci7dvsw,Well in the last volume if you remember the scene where they made up she also said she isnt really sure of what she wants. The main problem here is that man completely overlooked her feelings and opinions in both the confession and the student council elections. Yes maybe she was initially upset because he hurt Yui and also promoted superficial feelings during the fake confession but it became much worse later.After Isshiki Iroha was chosen as president some people commented on how great it would have been if Yukinoshita Yui and man would have all been together on the student council. My guess is that was her intention all along. So after both man and Yui campaigned against her she felt misunderstood and alone. Not even her close friends could tell her intentions and decided to act against her. In the end I guess the most important hint is Senseis foreshadowing. They all try to prevent the others from getting hurt but in the end fail due to their own clumsiness.By the way the last chapters were pretty interesting...

1483474,0,t1_cj1ti00,The world set up that you have is good it sounds interesting the only thing is that the first arc lacks something major it works well as a background story to understand who the characters are and how they began together but I dont think it would work as a full arc.It also depends on whether you want a more sliceoflife approach to the story or a more adventuring story or whatever other genre you want. If youre more for the sliceoflife approach you could expand on that story and do arcs for each bit like thisForming the band and winning the competition  Leaving the band and returning after a series of events.Also what are the ages of the characters? I feel as though they should be high school students because Seth still lives with his mother which means they started a band at the age of  or . Am I right with this?,LightNovels,cj2896e,2,t5_2sloz

2153906,0,t1_ckx4v9t,I know this is coming quite late but Gram Demolition doesnt require aiming either its just useful to do so. When Tatsuya trains the technique to be used spirits he doesnt use a directional point since hes targeting the realm of idea which doesnt correlate to the spacial information world. Also Tatsuya used Gram Demolition during the accident. Here is the relevant snipets of text. gtThat type of magic couldnt completely annihilate every Magic Sequence down to the last iota.gtIf Mayumis magic was synonymous to precision antiaircraft guns then the earlier magic if it was magic at all was something that would have carpet bombed the entire district. Not a single pillar would be left standing steel would turn molten the foundations and cement would scatter everywhere from the explosions rendering this entire area into complete rubble  that was how violent that attack was. That was during the accident you can see from Maris description shes describing a massive attack not a precise destruction like gram dispersion is.gtJust now... That was...gtWhen Tatsuya used Counter Magic no one was more astounded than Mari herself.gtMari was panting and unable to speak coherently. The surprising thing was that next to her Mayumi was able to reply blandly.gtGram Demolition... I had an inkling you were capable Tatsuyakun... And you didnt disappoint. gt................gtTo be able to say it like that youre quite calm about it Mari! However youre largely correct. During the match with Hanzoukun I thought Tatsuyakun was a more delicate finesse type... I never imagined that he was actually a front line bruiser.gtThen during the incident on the way here it was really...gtI believe thats what happened. I didnt see it at the time but didnt Mari witness it? There were at least ten overlapping Magic Sequences during the incident but they were all dispelled instantly... Exactly how high is his psion count...Your right that aiming it makes it easier but it makes it easier the same way using the targeting sights on a specialized cad does. You can cast magic without the sights or with them. Using them can take out  variable from the calculation step. However when using multitarget magic such as shooting down multiple objects at a time Tatsuya forgoes the aiming step. The training at Yakumo temple shows this as well as the fact hat Tatsuyas upper limit is  targets. The reason he couldnt take down  of Masaki shots all at once was due to how much Psion need to make up the cannon balls to shoot at his sequences so that they would be destroyed the technique is very inefficient so against someone of Masaki caliber even though he could target them all and use Gram Dispersion being stuck with only Gram Demolition made it so he couldnt take them all down,LightNovels,cldlz1g,3,t5_2sloz

3211038,0,t1_cout4vm,It should raise some serious flags. Getting to th rank without battle qi at their relatively young age is bizarre even for the Four Warrior clans. Its only because they are of Undying Warrior stock and furthermore even for Undying Warriors they are talented that they managed to get so far. Each stage is harder than the last. For them to get to th rank without battle qi in the  years or so between when Radiant Church captured them and now? Im not even sure getting to th rank is feasible for anyone without battle qi let alone getting there so fast. And its quite well known that Four Warrior clans essentially gain an extra rank when they transform so I think since Barkers are being proclaimed as th rank experts untransformed Radiant Church can connect the dots that they are Saints when transformed.,LightNovels,couto41,1,t5_2sloz

The person Linley freed by taking Bloodviolet was with them and they seemd quite friendly or at least not hostile. Ive been thinking Linley will end up fighting him since he first appeared I mean its the classic scenario isnt it? Hero accidently releases great evil from its sealed prison and has to defeat it. I thought it would end up being the final thing he did before he moved onto the the next plane which probably wont be for a while whatever happens but now weve seem him get along with the other Dieties Im starting to wonder if that will still be the case? He will obviously be important the story wouldnt have Linley unseal him if he wasnt but I assumed it would be in the form of a final gear check to take a term from mmos before Linley moved on. Now?

A lucky twist of fate one of the few in Nings life meant that Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals and monsters of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods a world where Dynasties lasted for millions of years. A world which is both greater...and yet also smaller...than he ever could imagine. He would have the opportunity to join them and in this life Ning swore to himself he would never let himself be weak again! The Era he was born into was a Desolate one but Ning would make it his era.

3564651,0,t3_315exb,I feel as though this is a repetition of the classic it wasnt made in Japan so it isnt mangaanime argument.  And just like the people that made those arguments youre technically correct but that doesnt mean that the content isnt relevant. For example every once in a while a mangainspiredmangastyle comic finds itself posted in rmanga and AFAIK this is permitted  provided that its properly labeled.I feel that is the only real observation I have about this sub  the only way for me to distinguish Wuxia Japanese LNs and English LNs here is to go and read them as the style usually gives it away in under a minute.  I would prefer that some proper labels get established so that people can avoid content they dont enjoy  rather than outright banning content because it doesnt fit perfectly.I dont really tend to enjoy Wuxia or English LNs btw.  English LNs in particular I dont enjoy because most of the time they dont go far enough in emulating the style of Japanese LNs  they feel instead like ordinary English creative writing with certain Japanese LN themes.  I get why that would turn people off as it doesnt appeal to me either but I dont think that trying to drive those people off is going to help unless you make a community specifically for them all hail rEnglishLightNovels?.  Right now it seems like theres simply not enough content out and people are going to seek out anything similar even if it doesnt strictly match the sub which seems to be the reason wuxias all over the place here.,LightNovels,cpylhss,5,t5_2sloz

Even some heavy implications that A and B end up together or maybe even A and B and C and D and the nearforgotten Y but it has to be heavily implied. As long as the ending fits the story progression and character development Im pretty much okay with either a true harem or single heroine end. But then again it has to fit the theme of the story for the ending to make proper storytelling sense. An MC who was pretty much dedicated to Girl A for the entire series and suddenly changes to a true harem ending in the last chapter of the last volume is a pretty crappy ending usually and vice versa for the opposite situation.

So I guess thats that we should keep the templates. I have  possible action items. I think maybe the wiki should be updated to add that reasoning. The community has agreed that a seriess relevant info should be included in the templated format because the links are very useful. Or something like that.. Im still of the opinion that doing what rTrueReddit does would be better using link posts and having this template info submitted as a comment. Well we can leave that for later.And maybe you have reliable internet but my connection is really spotty.

Controlled by Immortals who transcended the limits of mortality this world has mages and warriors as its elites all with the same goal of becoming an immortal. In the vast universe this world is an unremarkable one with no treasures but countless dangers where mortals are seen as nothing but cannon fodder for the strong.

He starts his journey with a small dream but will soon realise his destiny as the fate shows its cruelty.IMP NOTE  My work has no relation to Vin Diesels Riddick movie.

But Im terrible at being able to shorten things so this may be a bit long.  I may not do it justice and Im hoping I wont give too much away.Dream DriveWhat if you hated the world so much that you withdrew into virtual reality trying to find an escape only to realize how fake the virtual world is  nobody has a flaw everybody if beautiful and your friends only like you because youre constantly in the top players for multiple virtual reality games.  Then your favorite RPG developer comes out with a new game for the Dream Drive the device that lets you enter virtual reality. and after getting into the finalists position in a contest you drop out.  Since the finalists are guaranteed a copy of the game and if you drop out instead of playing it to the finish you get your copy that much faster.So then the day comes where you get your copy of the game.  Its a chip with an inverted pentagram on it.  So you plug the chip into your Dream Drive and lay on your bed.  A personal message pops up from the lead developer of the game and addresses you asking you to make your character like yourself.  Dont edit or change what you look like just play the game like you would as if you were living it.After confirming character creation you wake up naked on top of a tower over a giant black pit with NPCs telling you that youre a threat and knock you off into the blackness.  You then wake up in a dark damp tunnel underground and have to fight for survival against giant bipedal rats that have armor and daggers.  Ill skip the next bit that happens as I consider it incredibly important to the plot.yadda yadda you finally log out and go to the bathroom only to look in the mirror and see blood all over your cloths with that same inverted pentagram on your hand.Have you gone insanestarted hallucinating which is known to happen to people who delve too long into cyber reality or is there something else going on?And thats all Im going to say about it.  x  Sorry for the really long post.

But they cant get a better word for it because they keep using Machines to translate for them.Its actually read as Support like your Clerics and Enchanters.I cant emphasize enough the trouble with Machine Translated crap because it would lack the meaning the author mightve intended to. Our translations for this novel we research for terms. Author uses lots of German Nordic and among other references... Even we would flip around for a few hours checking dictionaries...But enough about that.Please dont come to a thread meant for people who views quality over speed.

But then halfway through they start building a harem and thats when I drop a series. The only series I didnt drop at that point was mushoku tensei. But that was because I really wanted to know what happened next. Im also sick of the super dense MC who just cant seem to figure out someone likes him.

Sure a weapon may come around that has higher base damage and other better stats but if he just kills some more players he could get like  bonus damage increase easily making this sword absolutely ridiculous. If you think about it he could just start putting every stat points into agility now since attack is useless now since the sword can just increase its damage to an unlimited amount he can just move like an assassin with a sword that hits like a truck and can only get better.Also forgot to mention it has unlimited durability so no worries about ever having to pay the repair fee again so thats a lot of gold and time saved.,LightNovels,crxvgvv,1,t5_2sloz

Another thing is that the whole werewolf supernatural thing takes away from the main plot of the VR story so it is confusing and slightly annoying.Wregards to BTTH  I like this story a lot more it is just all around betterimo and does not deviate from the main storyline and the MC is much more memorable.If you were to drop one I would have to say ZL but notifying your audience is very important to do and maybe drop some teasers of other series and gauge how your audience likes them and see if any of those series are ones you want to startor do more BTTH ples .In terms of pros and cons it really just depends what you as a translator wants to do but you should let audience know ahead of time and try to find a good stopping point or try to find someone else to pick it up.,LightNovels,cs1mqd3,1,t5_2sloz

4230524,0,t1_cs1vzfv,tldr Interesting needs work but could grow on you. pussy mcup to ch  tragic paths handle unneeded rapeStopped reading at chapter  reading the scene that was portrayed that chapter was hard enough. I dont really like that kinda thing but the way it was put into the story was something I couldnt care for. From the end of that chapter it did nothing to influence the story from what I can tell so the TBOATPs rape of the mother like figure was really unneeded as it didnt do anything for the story.Up to what I read The mc till that point is literally a weak little bitch who ran away but is hinted to have a kinda of power from long ago however when his new family is face with that kinda problem he doesnt try anything. It said before that he went to the library to read up on magic but he didnt even try to use it? On chapter  however he blames himself for not learning magic...Dont understand this could use some background building to explain how he couldnt use it or didnt decide to train it but it doesnt explain either In the prologue and some places in the story there after could use some polishing up on phrases and grammar uses. Take for example this in the prologue Among those races were the Celestials angelic beings of light and the Demons demonic beings of darkness repetitive explanations could give the same information with fewer words. The introductions of characters in chapter  was a little eh I couldnt make out the name between the eldest sister and the mother until later. Unless I missed something reading it The story up to chapter  mention something about dantian but up to what Ive read you could get the same out of just saying magic.only read till ch,LightNovels,cs2gp8t,1,t5_2sloz

4308659,0,t1_csb8egz,It was said in the chapter that he is just below sovereign which means that hes a Paragon fused all profound mysteries of a law. Also a necromancer. Anyway bullshit that hes stronger than Beirut that guy is near to being a paragon he said to Linley before he left that Linley should fuse profound truths  starting at demigod  something he himself regrets not doing iirc. So Beirut has probably fused five of six profound truths of darkness which is already quite OP. Add to that him being a God Eater rat that is inherently OP digesting countless highgod sparks getting stronger with each one digested plus him having at least several sovereign artifacts I am  sure that Beirut will be the strongest being below Sovereigns until Linley has become whatever IET is planning on him becoming. My guess is a mutated soul paragon who has fused the profound laws of Earth Wind Fire Water and Destruction carrying a soulprotecting sovereign artifact and having been supplied with the Atlas of Thousand Beasts by his mate Qin Yu who after having broken through the Universe stage of the Stellar Transformations can travel to other parallel universes at will and was searching for similar minds...,LightNovels,csbb8aw,2,t5_2sloz

If you havent realized this is exBaka Tsuki moderator and current Hatter Teh Ping typingWell the plan was to give . to a certain group which I did several months back before the volume was even released on March  this year. Due to certain issues I wont be publicly naming the group that is supposed to be translating this volume...which is about  pages short.Currently I still have no news of the translation progress but Im willing to give the team time...until I do finish my main translation series and I already have my time reduced to  due to RL work. Im in a pretty tight spot at the moment but this doesnt mean I wont be able to finish that series this year.Ill wait and see if theres any changes in situation come  and if nothing happens Ill eventually take over.On a side note the current going rate for a JPgtEN translation varies but the most common one is a per word pricing basis  cents USD at minimum. A  page LN with most of the  words x  lines filled will give around k words...so you can do the math,LightNovels,cssuuzo,5,t5_2sloz

He finds a hidden room with cultivation and swords techniques thought lost for thousands of years. He masters them over the course of  years but its already too late.  He started his training too late in life and humanity is wiped out. The demons come for him and after killing s he succumbs to his wounds. In an act of final defiance he activates the magic runes that once killed every man woman and child in the country. Instead of doing the same again however  the MC discovers he had been returned to the moment of his birth. He even still had the internal energy he had already cultivated.  He even finds himself with fragments of knowledge of other worlds.  This time  he promises himself  no running.  This time hell become a noble and beat them in their games.

So I cant help but think this is what the writer himself thinks rather than the opinion of a fictional character in a fictional world.Perhaps if she was described as pretty and black I wouldnt mind.

4876774,0,t1_cu8uman,The latest heroine I really like is from Generation of the Military Counselor The heroine is exSWAT police detective that gets transported to pseudo ancient China. I love how she ends up taming soldiers under her command. If were talking Japanese LNs I like the heroines from Saiunkoku Monogatari and Janshin Average though for different reasons. All the titles Ive just listed are more female oriented novels. Nothing to stop guys from enjoying them though. And with the exception of the last title they were also written for an older audience.

4994417,0,t1_cunzyxq,Another problem that sometimes come is too much localization. As a collector Ill buy Light Novels that Ive read before for the sake of rereading and collecting. However if the licensed release has too much localization such as replacing honorifics or other god awful changes Id sooner import the originals from Japan and just read the fantranslated version. At least this is what Im planning on doing depending on how Yen Press handles OreGairu.I can understand a publisher wanting to market to a wider audience but the problem is that they arent really bringing in the new audience correctly. Teaching what the terms are is better than white washing over them and pissing off the collectors. Including something like a glossary near the beginning or end would be better then ruining honorifics which are commonly used to establish relationships between characters. A new audience shouldnt be dependent on localizations from a single publisher when they end up going to watch something off of CR or read manga and suddenly see all these new terms and such that they werent taught before. Light Novels and Manga have a great position of being able to include TN Notes or Glossaries while anime is harder considering the amount of time it can remain on screen. Rant over.

For instance Splenda is a widely used artificial sweetenerPepsi just started using it in their Diet soda that is labeled safe and most people can costume it fine but my family is actually intolerant to it. Our bodies actually reject it giving us symptoms like diarrhea bloating etc. My point is you cant really label anything harmless but also not harmful as it completely depends on the situation and circumstances.

5403279,0,t3_3ozmgm,I think Raphtalia was the daughter of some nobleman and a commoner. He didnt want to succeed the family and ran off to elope with his beloved who was a commoner. Well nobleman might be too vague I guess royalty of some sorts? After all they had shrine maidens and what not to protect them Sadina Luka water dragon etc..If the general area Naofumi operated in is considered to be Europe Raphtalias homeland can be considered Japan as it was very Eastern themed. Sadinas loincloth tanuki killer etc.With Raphtalias father dead the next in line is Raphtalia so she can be considered royalty in a sense. Thats why if Naofumi chooses to marry her hed have to deal with her country moving against him which is why Sadina warned him.This is made clear in the Christmas special I believe in the first chapter when Naofumi went and crushed her homeland to claim Raphtalia completely.And no she isnt from another dimension but from the far east. If you recall Japans history they were pretty devout isolationists keeping to themselves and rejecting outside contact. Raphtalias homeland is similar to this so I can guess why someone might think she might be from another dimension.,LightNovels,cw2buil,5,t5_2sloz

Primarily because the home market is xenophobicproud as shit and wont risk pissing off their main customers by catering to smelly gaijins. And secondly because the release schedule of japanese media is way faster than the niche market overseas can support.  Its an empty promise.

6628997,0,t1_d04swpo,gtI didnt watch the second half of the second season You did yourself a favour the second half of Railgun S is awful.Though you should give the Lns and manga a shot if you get the chance. Theyre pretty awesome.gtbut considering how Endymion was a movie to both Railgun and Index and how Accels manga contains plenty magic I always assumed it had some in Railgun... well guess I was wrong then.I highly doubt that the author has read much of the source material for either series or theyd consider Index the oldest of the ones on the list instead of ZnT.gt After a quick look at the wiki Saten has a magical talisman in Railgun though that probably doesnt count right? DNope. In the Raildex universe every talisman cross or other religiously symbolic item has some kind of magical value its just unnoticeable small.gt Actually maybe the author of the list counted Kamijous power as magic? I mean it isnt an esper ability so naturally one would assume its magic.That and the series goes out of its way to say that his ability cant be explained by either side s With the exception of one or two people.. Either way the school itself doesnt teach or have any association with magic. Also the magicians in the series dont appear to even go to a proper school and were probably taught by the church.gtIts magic gained through science. I just learned the word recently but its called technomancy I think.gtFrom WiktionarygtgtA category of magical abilities that either affect technology or to magical powers that are gained through the use of technology.The problem is that magic by definition cant be understood by scientific means. This is clearly not the case in Mahouka as the series explains the mechanics behind the system and spells used in great detail. Also the abilities in Mahouka are inherent not gained through technology. At least thats what I could gather from the few Lns that I read.gtWell in Index and Railgun he probably meant the whole city with school which makes kind of sense as it is compromised by how many percent of students? ? Im sure you can generalize in that case especially when the city is named Academy City and the remaining  contain mostly teachers and researchers. I guess...It still feels odd having Index and Railgun put in the same category as ZnT.gtWhich makes me wonder now with how many people they need for shops how many students they actually have. Or whether the teachers run the shops Well there are about  nonstudents around so that probably covers a lot of jobs.I really shouldnt be nitpicking about an article like this but I really hate the way this ones been presented.,LightNovels,d04zuav,2,t5_2sloz

7243742,0,t3_4emdg3, Koutarou Changing  I really love that were seeing Koutarou striving to change himself bit by bit as an effect of what we saw last volume.  Maki  I really like her character a lot. She reminds me of Nisekoi Spoilerss Haru in that she genuinely is a match in terms of personality and character. The romance for most of the characters stem from different things Yurika  She fell in love with her caretaker so to speak. Being with him for such a long time allowed her feelings to mature. Sanae  Fell in love with him after growing close to him like he is family which eventually turned into love. Kiriha  Shes admired him since he was her savior and loved him for many years. Pretty much a childhood crush that can be fulfilled. Theia  Spent a lot of time with him and came to admire his noble heart eventually leading to love. Clan  Similar to Theia. She was beaten and essentially reformed by Koutarou.  Harumi  A target of admiration. She wants to support Koutarou honestly and sees him in a similar aspect as her knight in shining armor. Its pretty much the same with Alaia. Maki  With Maki I really like how she is a genuine friend with a similar character. Shes kind of like that person that is closer than your best friend. I really like how well she matches with Koutarou. Maki  Back on topic I really admired her conflict during this volume. Shes already come to a sense that she is in love with him and doesnt want to hurt him. However she was stuck in this position where couldnt outright leave to be with him. Adding onto that she was afraid of severing her connection with him and potentially falling out of love. Its a really hard psychological thing for her to have to deal with. Its along the lines of rejecting yourself to be happy in the moment. Overall Im really glad with how it turned out and that she was able to move past it. Alaia gt Harumi  Im super satisfied with how this foreshadowed plotline closed. Turns out that Harumi is something like the reincarnation of Alaia who unknowingly was acting as a medium to support Koutarous sword. It wasnt until Alaia decided to merge with Harumi that the sword has become super powerful once again. Overall this really brings a great sense of a slightly warmer closure to Alaias romance considering she was essentially the first rejection in the series and didnt really get her Happily Ever After. So now Harumi is going to stick to Koutarou enough for the both of them. Her stepping onto the stage was really a huge step forward for her romance. I mentioned in the last volumes discussion that she was likely at the worse position in terms of closeness to Koutarou. So stepping into his world is really a great leap forward that puts her on par with the rest of the Invaders.  Goddess of Love  She showed up again after Yurika and Harumi merged. It was mentioned that she had two orbs circling around her so I think were finally getting bits of explanation in regards to her existence. She is likely the culmination of all the heroines should they merge or something. There are two more orbs as well since the second chapter of the first volume in the illustration from last volume. The first volume describes  orbs on the pillars of her resting place while the previous volume showed  circling her. Potentially more behind her. This volume weve gotten a glimpse at who represents which orbs. If we do count all the orbs they match the number of heroines in love with Koutarou. Though some credit against this would be that we didnt start with  heroines in love with Koutarou but . Unless Alaia is counted in the beginning to make up that .  With the additional two making sense with the addition of Maki amp Clan.  Yellow  Yurika White  Harumi.  Yurikas Moment of Peace  One of my favorite moments this volume was just Yurikas moment of realization and calmness after waking up after her panic attack in the bath. Really was such a nice scene.  Cycles of Four  Something I think done well with this series is how the pacing is set around groups of four in this series. Volumes  were an introduction. Volumes  were character arcs for developing the heroines and bringing their conflicts to light. Volumes . were about revealing the hidden background. And with Volumes  weve had all the main heroines confess their love. Im really excited to see volumes  which I assume is where we start seeing more of the conflict for the heroines. Especially considering its revealed that the Darkness Rainbow is working with the Underground People. Also with Theias mother getting sick thats another really serious plot line. In fact the only heroine without a serious conflict surrounding her at the moment is Sanae. However Maki has entered in on Yurikas side of the Magical Girl conflict.  Theia Volume Incoming  Lastly Im really looking forward to the next volume considering were going to potentially be going back to Fortorthe this time in present day. With our MC as the Blue Knight I wonder how exactly he might end up revealed at long last to Theia. ,LightNovels,d21k7eg,2,t5_2sloz

8943767,0,t1_d7jxl2l,gt His stats are fucking ridiculous now as hes once again SS on everything but Agility being SSS and Magic being A.We also learned something interesting about his stats in this volume that wasnt mentioned previously and that I completely overlooked.After the minotaur fight at the end of Volume  his stats that the Loki familia crew read off his back and the stats listed on his character sheet graphic at the end of the book were the stats that he had BEFORE the minotaur fight. For reference they weregt Str S Def S Util S Agi SS Mag BBut apparently those grew even higher from the minotaur fight itself and those statupgrades were applied before leveling up. We were never shown those stats but when Hermes was pestering Hestia to tell him in this volume we learned that his final stats at LV before leveling up to LV weregt Hestia Everything but Agility was SS...with the reader left to infer that his Agility was SSS because even before the minotaur fight it was SSAnd now the final numbers we were shown weregt Str SS Def SS Util SS Agi SSS Mag ABut my question is Is this the same sleightofhand as with the end of Volume ? Basically are those prewargame numbers or postwargame numbers?Regardless even having a single stat of SS was enough to temporarily fry Riverias brain and send her into a fit of stupid laughter so those stats are literally off the charts.

10069244,0,t1_dbjy1un,No worries! I understand that many hardcore fans have very intense feelings about the works that they love. I do too!I just wanted to provide some perspective on the works and the language of the stories that we all love and why what some people assert is not always the whole picture. I think its only fair if an author is against fan translations and wants them taken down. Its their work after all. If the author is fine with it I see no problem with there being unofficial translations. But if an author is against it and most authors are unfortunately then ignoring that means that your wishes as a reader trumps the wishes of the author. I dont know if I could say I agree with that. At the same time I understand the desire to be able to read something thats out there already but not officially released in your language. I think most of the issues is that the most popular series that English readers are reading have been out for years and continue to come out. Its only natural that itll take official translators time to catch up. If it were up to me Id let fan translations stay up until the official releases caught up and then ask the fan TLs to take it down. But unfortunately Im not in charge of Japanese authors...As a side note I have all the Full Metal Panic manga and LNs because I love that series. Isnt Tokyo Pop defunct now? Im pretty sure their license is probably up. I dont actually know though. The speed issue is definitely about how little money there is in the English LN market right now. If there was more money thered be more staff and they would churn things out faster. Also Japanese publishers do a lot of takedowns of fan translations. They like to talk about it on twitter or blogs sometimes. So even if all the licenses were to magically end over night I dont think that would stop takedowns. But more back to point about honorifics its kind of difficult to talk about a natural sounding alternative to using Japanese honorifics when using Japanese honorifics is already unnatural. Its simply that certain readers have gotten used to them being there but theyre kind of the epitome of unnatural sounding terms of address in English. Usually no honorific  describing through prose is the best way as we often do not use honorifics in English. But there are many times that we do. School for example business meetings etc. Anyways I think we agree on many things. The challenges of the English LN industry are difficult to surmount for fan and publisher alike. My recommendation? Learn Japanese! It pretty much eliminates all the problems for a reader. Cheers!,LightNovels,dbk1myk,1,t5_2sloz

10163935,0,t3_5lj8fe,To start off one thing that kind of ticked me off at the very end Haruhime was a virgin. facepalmKind of a copout of a reveal. At the very least I really hope she propels the romance going forward considering how she is. On the topic of action damn was that as great as usual. Im kind of glad that Bell didnt win against the Toad Monster but that she got defeated by someone else. Disappointed that she wasnt actually killed considering shes a huge bitch. Freyas love is kind of scary. She mentioned back in volume  or  that she loves everyone in her guild but Im starting to wonder if she actually does love Bell even more than the others. My opinion of her did rise though as Im starting to like her myself as shes an interesting Goddess.Hermes while he may be after the raising of a hero will probably end up getting sent back up to Heaven at some point due to his continuously dangerous actions. I foresee that his defeat will probably come as hes still raving about heroes and such. Thats the only fitting kind of demise for him.The author has really been keeping away from revealing stats lately. Thank you Crazy Sex Goddess for showing us his back. XDBell CranellLevel ThreeStrength I    Defense H    Dexterity I Agility G    Magic I Luck H Immunity IMagicFirebolt SwiftStrike MagicSkillsLearis Freese rapid growth continued desire results in continued growth strong desire results in stronger growthArgonaut charges automatically with active actionThe kind of sad part knowing these stats now is that because of how little theyre shown I cant remember if theyre supposed to be good or not. I imagine they jumped again after the end of the volume since his stats are only applied on updates. With all the thrashing around and battling I imagine his Agility probably went all the way up to S again. XD Honestly though Im really looking forward to seeing if hell get a new nickname at the next God meeting.

10178343,0,t3_5lquul,Just finished it and its an interesting concept to say the least. Im not sure if Id highly rate the series yet considering how episodic it feels. I mean it almost feels like Goblin Slayer belongs in some kind of Collection of Stories series which would all take place in this fantasy world. Ill have to wait and see how the second volume is done but thatll be a while. It was kind of interesting how the perspective shifted throughout the story and only really fell directly upon the Goblin Slayer in the last story. We got perspectives from Priestess Farm Girl Guild Clerk Haremlt random adventurers and even a Goblin Lord. I think one of my favorite moments was the very end about how the Gods would play dice and everything. After reading the afterword it almost feels like the Gods are just playing DampD. XDIn the end I hope the Goblin Slayer is able to eventually retire and train new adventurers on how to fight Goblins. ,LightNovels,dbxrs1q,5,t5_2sloz
10181704,0,t1_dbxteu1,This is quite possible thank you for putting it into an easy to understand context. As a side note there is the fact that it was written in a way that Naofumi was going to open the door but it says that Raphtalia is the one does it.When I originally wrote the rant it was coming more from a place of feeling. In hindsight I shouldnt have said atrocious. I was just coming from a place of disappointment.In regards to the fan translation is there more than place that covers it?

11032907,0,t3_5xi69d, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu this is my recommendation for any one who loves silly comedy and school life. Its finished with  vols in total. Eromangasensei Its the same author as Oreimo and in my opinion its much better than Oreimo and funnier. There will be an anime adaption this April. Hataraku Maousama! another good comedy series with both serious and funny moment. The Circumstances Leading to Waltrautes Marriage even though its just a oneshot its still quite good with lots of great moments.Off topic but if you enjoy Baka Test I recommend checking out the Grand Blue manga. Same author so the jokes are really good and land every single time. This is literally the most hilarious manga Ive ever read in years.,LightNovels,deijzjq,7,t5_2sloz

11600405,0,t1_dgawm5a,Yeah I am happy you understood what I was trying to imply with the spoiler. That was something most people didnt expect which I did already from the beginning of the story so some people hated the LN for it.

11777754,0,t3_6819bv,From what Ive heard from translators a lot of Japanese web novels rely on the speech quirks of the character as an identifier to the reader. So often theres no context other than that making it hard to figure out whos speaking without it. A lot of the translators of Japanese web novels are amateurs without the skill needed to translate these speech quirks into English without making them annoying. So most just give up in translating the speech quirks and just add the names instead.,LightNovels,dgv1nqy,6,t5_2sloz

11794244,0,t3_688yeh,Hi! Translator of the LN here.Like all the other responses in this thread I would say that the LN is just as good  if not better  than the anime. Its a lot more detailed and since the story is so characterdriven youll see a lot more thoughts monologues and development coupled by the authors characterdriven writing style. Also consider that there are  volumes of the LN in total and the anime stopped at the end of the th volume.Regarding how LNs are different from your usual novel theres nothing you really need to know. Theyre simply shorter than your average novel usually around  pages and will read like young adult fiction with a Japanese flair. Youll understand when you start reading them.,LightNovels,dgwx1dc,16,t5_2sloz
