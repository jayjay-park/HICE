9841708,0,t1_dail9el,Hi guysI downloaded the episodes twice using torrent but the sound keeps skipping  imagine you keep pressing the mute button on your remote on and off. Its not something to do with the PC because its running just fine and the video track runs without problems. Wanted to see if anybody else had this problem and if so whether you know a fix for it. Cheers,torrentrequests,daqebme,1,t5_2wjos
