10181190,0,t1_dby1rpu,You can get skulls by backing your games. Basically as you play games you earn a sort of bronze circle currency. Once you earn enough of those by just playing games in the pre lobby you can use those bronze circles to back bet on your self. Once you have backed your game the higher position you come in that game the more skulls you earn. You can then use these skulls in the skull store to buy items. At the moment the items in the skull store are ugly and rubbish... so backing your game is pointless... which is why i suggested to change the items in the skull store weekly!

10253380,0,t1_dc64w39,Yeah I think the Assist should be scored as a percent of the damage you did where the person who gets the kill automatically gets say  percent of say  points for a kill for maths sake. Then the rest of the  points in this case  points is allocated as a percentage of how much damage you did. That way the person who gets the kill ALWAYS gets more points for it but if you did  percent of the damage you would still get a hefty prize in this case . x   ..edit Im bad at math so.... .? idk.,kotk,dc69z48,3,t5_317v1

The servers were terrible it was like the first few seconds after landing on EU but the whole time.

Restore points are good to have in case you install softwarehardware drivers that corrupts you computer and you can revert to a last know working state. This doesnt not affect your user profile documents ect. Windows has a build in program for this.

Barefoot  Slowest speed available and nd quietest option availableThere are tradeoffs so you cant just say one is a straight upgrade from the other.I prefer being quiet so unless I have to travel a long distance across a field while walking I keep stealth shoescrocs equipped. If Im in a neighborhood city cabins compound etc. I will always have stealth shoes on.Since they are not a straight upgrade it would not make sense for the fast shoes to overtake the quiet shoes.Notice if you are wearing LOUD shoes and I am wearing QUIET shoes you will not be able to hear me move while you are also moving but I can hear you.

10804487,0,t1_dduawip,This is a very common misconception about hacks. Most people seem to have this idea that if someone is using hacks they cant lose and rarely will. Thing is thats what we call blatant. Someone like him who is trying to be considered one of the best players in hz would quickly lose his credit if hes blatant as others would notice. There are cheats that are much more harder to spot. For example he could simply have a aim lock. Aim locks are semicomplicated essentially with an aimlock he doesnt necessarily need it to lock on to an enemy. Aim lock can be used simply for gathering info. An aim lock can have a smoothness effect where it will slowly move the cursor to a nearby player but not snap on to them. For example if he doesnt know which way a player turned down on a road. He taps the aim key and it moves slightly to the right telling him the player most likely went to the right.,kotk,dduenko,6,t5_317v1

In the last  months they fixed people using emotes to make their hitbox dodge they fixed snaking from cars they fixed silent cars and they added a ping indicator. Thats it from a development perspective. Is that really worth k for their devs? Come on. That office is just loaded with interns having no clue what to do and bad devs raking in the cash to come up with shit tweaks that they cant even implement.

10927924,0,t3_5w487v,From what I have experienced in this game my explanation would be that the network connection is two ways. So you have to consider the latency of your information to the server and for the server to receive and respond. When the server is congested or overworked the latter might be problematic. Hence which is why you may have a bloody good connection and the game just craps out on you.TLDR Server is crap on high loads.,kotk,de75088,3,t5_317v1

11171853,0,t3_5zi97i,Welcome to KOTK! Your love amp hate relationship will only intensify  over time. It has been said many times but thats for good reason force yourself into as many fights as you can to improve quickly and drastically.Land in a city pick up a helmet slick sneakers AR amp shotgun and go for it. Utilize the environment for cover dont over extend when your enemy does have cover! Peeking too wide will get you  tapped easily because you can line up shot from behind cover. The  spin with a car is easy but also requires practice to nail it down in every situation. I can post a video when I get home today unless someone can link the Stormen video where he explains it perfectly. The AR has no recoil instead it requires a tapping rhythm you need to learn and practice. Once you get the rhythm down the AR will love you and you will love the AR. Drop shotters are either incredibly noob or very skilled. If you die because of it moan real loud in the microphone. When you insta  tapped the fool cause his head is the only thing you can shoot moan really loud as well. They will be left in an aroused but confusing state of mind. Lastly control your emotions raging never did anyone any good. Recollect yourself and do better the next game. I will post videos later on today. If I ever get home. edit So I made it home! Here you can find the  degree car drift and here  you can find the AR shooting rhythm! Good luck and happy hunting!,kotk,deybfqt,8,t5_317v1

Easy af.Press F hold shift and a or d and roll the game awaySame with seat swapping  button press to switch seats plus W or S at the same time...A normal macro setup via mouse software will normally get stuckkeep starting over as they cant do a hold function.,kotk,df2u9nw,1,t5_317v1

Fights are more spaced but they are way more intense and fun.While kotk has one or two main weapons Battlegrounds has already  or  good weapons with scopes silencers grips muzzles etc...Technically Battlegrounds is already miles away from this garbage and its amazing how much the game improved in the last  weeks while kotk just stopped in time.

11544965,0,t3_64mv8s,Feel free to skip any questions Im just spouting my thoughts really. Is the current darkness and fogginess of the game intended? It really disrupts gameplay and reverts itself after a few games.  Is the k tournament available to view outside the US? Im interested in your thoughts on weapon balance. The shotgun is extremely inconsistent the AK is amazing close range and awful anywhere else and the AR is everyones goto weapon. The pistols are essentially useless spare the magnum and melee weapons  bows  special arrows are a meme at this point. There arent enough points of contest on the map leading to games where its difficult to find people. Are there any plans to improve crate drops e.g.  sniper Ive had  crates without snipers or add other points to battle over e.g. double xp zones.  The Skull system encourages teaming since you only get one chance per X games to get the bounty of  skulls. Have you considered adding skull rewards to crates  rare reward for kills or other methods that are more attainable?  The truck is basically useless and is everyones last resort. Are there plans to improve this or is it intended?  The glass on cars is way too dark to see bodys so you cant reliably hit people whilst they see your entire body. Are there any plans to improve this? A high ping player can hit players who have already moved behind cover. Half the games I die Im already behind cover and its really frustrating.  Hipfire is extremely accurate to the point where aiming in close range is pointless. Grenades are slightly overpowered  not due to their damage but the fact there is no indication of their arrival until it is way too late. Possible to make the initial priming louder?Thanks for your time and keep up the good work. The community here are very hostile sometimes and Im surprised you guys put up with it. ,kotk,dg4mgr3,2,t5_317v1

If all games had  players then the top kill games would be like . You would spend most of the entire game just trying to find people. Also there are certain places you can spawn with no vehicles that even if you loot for  minutes and then start running you still wont make it to the safe zone in time. Faster gas would mean more people choking on the gas and not dying to other players. ,kotk,dg53cm1,1,t5_317v1

11644382,0,t3_664tc6,My opinion on the subject is that the meta has rolled through by itself and some gun changes also had an impact on it. AK nerf made AR mainstream shotgun adjustments made players focus on shotguns as well. Back in Z the game was still relatively new and many people did not know how to play well yet. I myself have had  wins on Z despite having less than  hours on it. Now I cannot get any win in h of Z people just shoot and hide too well.    I also think that this is just a nostalgia thing. From one side I wish the game had less vehicles from the other imagine how much of an advantage a vehicle gives to the player. The graphics were also vastly improved. I think they really went in right direction. Here comes hope they will not push too many major changes to the game or we may expect another stall in games development. ,kotk,dgfwkhc,1,t5_317v1

11756860,0,t1_dgslnnt,surely you guys still have room to tighten up things considerably? as seen here this game has much larger delays for everything compared to othersalso have you guys considered to look into some more stricter integrity checking when it comes to how much lag is compensated?for example getting hit a whole ft behind cover is very excessive while many other games would simply reject hits if there is to large of a discrepancy between player locationsin pretty much every game ever the player with the higher ping feels the effect of his high ping and is at a disadvantage but in this game its feels quite the opposite since the server seems to basically green light and accept whatever the high ping player throws at it as reality even with a huge discrepancy in player location.,kotk,dgso4gm,1,t5_317v1

11777555,0,t1_dguzp4h,No problem bro. I myself had app center before and it didnt cause any issues but recently gigabyte sent out a easy tune engine service update that screwed up everything. I hope they fix it soon because its causing a lot of people to believe they have faulty hardware when its just a major screwup in their software department. ,kotk,dgv0uha,1,t5_317v1
11779011,0,t1_dgv5vye,I havent bought anything in this game cosmetics are not worth the money for me. I invested  hours in this game.. I see improvements on communication with community.. Bugs are still flowing around but I see less of them recently.. Game longevity  hard to say at the moment but they are working to keep it alive and relevant.. Game was optimized a lot in the latest  GB patch it improved FPS for me quite a lot so you cant say that they arent working on optimization.To be honest I cant tell you about any updates since I dont keep all this stuff in my memory. I just remember the last  gb patch being huge for me also the adding of extra EU server in January helped my gameplay a lot.Again the OUTRAGE is very subjective I dont have much to rage about since the game got much better for me personally. My point was that some people on here are here just to complain not actually help the game get better with quality feedback.,kotk,dgv6shp,5,t5_317v1
