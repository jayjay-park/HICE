3295463,0,t1_cp3ud8h,Im honestly confused what youre angry about. This is intended to be propaganda to boost morale and gain support. Are you upset they we stopped participating in Operation Arm Chop? I just realized that may be an unintended side effect of our strategy... SincerelyMe edit ive removed this from the sub so its just us here,FederalNavy,cp3wqzk,1,t5_371km
3395921,0,t3_2z0feu,Going to head over there and deploy at Hartsfield Market. Then I shall start intercepting some CSG ships and engage in combat zones over the next week.,FederalNavy,cpfd13f,3,t5_371km
3505053,0,t3_307658,Looks like the Khaka goal is over commanders. We have made it to tier  where I made it into the top  with about  hours of doing runs in my T. Sometimes even venturing for  LYs with my wing to secure a source of Battle Weapons and smuggling it back making roughly k profit on a round trip. Not amazing but for the CG it was worth it. Now lets put those weapons into use and take back Lugh!,FederalNavy,cprsu86,3,t5_371km
3628046,0,t1_cq599ix,Thanks for the info! Im not really sure what direction Im going to go in the game yet but I do think Ill spend some time ranking up Federation if for no other reason than to go ooo and ahhh at sol.Quick followup if ranking up with one faction doesnt decrease your standing with another does this mean you could rank up Federation then Empire without losing your fed rank?,FederalNavy,cq5tpi7,1,t5_371km

3779163,0,t1_cqn0xe1,I understand that. But does it mean that once I adhere to the PP system I wont be able to be independent? Theres a difference between switching sides and not having one... I think that we can only wait for further details and the beta coming out...,FederalNavy,cqn1vkf,1,t5_371km
3813926,0,t1_cqqv4ao,We pushed Bloodhawk to create and lead an awesome group and gave him lots of advice about how to go about it.Bloodhawk and our guys are good friends outofgame... and we really want to see a Federation group doing what were doing since we get so many people going I would join EIC if it wasnt Empire and weve been pushing Bloodhawk for ages to be the leader that the Federation needed in our opinion. We certainly dont take credit for Merchant Marines existing or any of its achievements... not saying that at all... but we certainly did peer pressure him into starting a group and offer a lot of help setting it up hed tell you that much.  Sorry I get all the H names confused... Hudson  Either way big deal. Congrats ,FederalNavy,cqr0ob6,1,t5_371km
