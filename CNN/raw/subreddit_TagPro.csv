Most of the times I do it without a rolling bomb.In honesty though the best way to deal with these situations is to play full d only if the score is tied. It may take five minutes but eventually one of those nubbies might score.Also another tactic is to try and allow their lesser skilled players to grab the flag while you have their flag. I do this by duel suiciding with the flag if their best player has the flag.Its a frustrating position though.,TagPro,cei4zpb,13,t5_2w7hh

And I have no problems with that  ball ready to grabandrun if theyre careful not to be too flacid with the grab. The enemy cant score if we have possession of the flag so  enemy flag possession is not a bad goal. ,TagPro,ceqg6he,-1,t5_2w7hh

193298,0,t3_1wbmz6,Well you basically try to capture more flags than the other team to win. You can play either defense stop them from getting away from your base with the flag by popping them once they grab or offense grab their flag and juke defenders all the way back to your flag. First team to  caps win unless time limit is reached. Usually we have a post explaining this but there is a video on tagpro.koalabeast.com that explains how to play in  seconds.

219404,0,t3_1wmiqn,I just felt an overwhelming wave of sentimentality.I remember playing this game back in May and I was instantly hooked. It was so basic yet so addicting. I immediately thought Have I played this game before? It seems so familiar. I mean Capture the Flag is such a standard game type and this game has only been around since February? Well shit its free too. This is awesome.In June and July I played ALL DAY LONG at work. Thats when I got the crown. Id come home and play even more after that. I remember logging on around noon at times and seeing no one online. Then Id log in during peak hours and see no more that  players. I always thought to myself This game should be MUCH MUCH MUCH more popular.I never really got mad while playing. Id get frustrated at times God damn it why are asdf and op never on my team?!?! but the game was fun enough that win or lose it always felt like a good time.I was OBSESSED with the stats early on. I loved how it tracked everything. I use to check the leaderboard and compare myself to other players constantly. Oh wow Mike wins all the time! christine has so many returns! Sal averages more than a cap a game! Should I try to cap more? Nah Ill go for the most returns instead.I think it was cat that suggested I should check out Mumble IRC and MLTP. He told me to sign up for Season . I was hesitant at first but I always saw updates about Season  in the subreddit and wished I had played.I logged onto Mumble after Dethos drafted me to Marble Madness but I didnt have a mic. That was probably a good thing because I was kinda nervous. I never really participated in a gaming community before so I didnt know what to expect. The team was super friendly. swerve and Some Ball didnt talk too much but they were cool. Guys like Dethos Low Ball The Abbot and Lambda were really kind and even MLTP was a lot of fun even though we lost all the time.Around this time I started to play PUGs as well. Guys like harry ball Dino Infinity raven JGibbs and PrivateMajor were usually on and a lot of fun to play with and just to hang out with in general. Guys like sidewalk and Swingman would occasionally barge in spouting nonsense about Centra but they seemed alright as well. The games were a lot harder with all these guys but way more fun.Around this time the cz push happened. There were a TON of new players most of which werent very good since they were so new. I started feeling like I was pretty damn good around this time. I got a few messages asking for tips on how to get better. I remember seeing the infographic and people throwing out some tips and tricks to the game and I really want to add something like that so I decided to write my guide to defense. It was everything I ever knew about TagPro at the time and a lot of fun to organize.Season  was about to start up. Dethos couldnt play and Low Ball was MIA so I got to be captain. I always worried about how well I played that I didnt really know enough about other players enough to know who to draft so I was nervous about that. I made sure to bring back swerve and Some Ball and then drafted based on familiar faces in public games  Hornets and good looking stats MKo. I was equally nervous trying to run the team since Im never considered myself much of a leader but it was cool writing up guides for the team and gameplanning against other teams. It was also cool to see guys like The Boulder Rambo Turbo and Stalin get better and play well in MLTP after just recently joining the game. Also TPTV went from being some sort of half ass way to watch MLTP to an organized and hilarious stream because of guys like drukqs Pigoon asdf BBQ and The Boulder.I think whats kept me around TagPro so long isnt so much the game anymore but the community. LuckySpammer always seems to consider the community anytime he makes a change. Its never a surprise when something gets included because its something hes usually discussed with the community to get feedback before its implemented. The amount of time other people put into troubleshooting servers making maps testing maps writing guides organizing tournaments organizing MLTP logging stats streaming matches commentating matches running teams organizing posts running the subreddit responding to questions comments and concerns and promoting the community is astounding to me. People are doing all this just for the betterment of the game and for others to enjoy it. Besides Lucky I dont think anyone else is making money off of TagPro and even he was in the red until the very recent success of the game. The mass donations at Christmas was one of the more generous things Ive ever been a part of. The bug prank was one of the more hilarious things Ive ever been a part of as well.I didnt expect this to be so long winded but allinall Ive gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this silly little game in the last year than I ever would have expected the day I was mindlessly browsing rWebGames. I can only hope that others share this feeling with me and that we can have more of that in year . Congratulations to TagPro on a successful year!tldr TagPro good,TagPro,cf3fp5t,26,t5_2w7hh

You will be able to change how you feel about a map anytime you play it. So when a map  first comes out maybe you hate it... but then it kind of grows on you so you change your rating. This will give us close to live feedback on how players feel about maps. Its not as susceptible to tampering as internet surveys For example we could only consider ratings from accounts with  hours. ,TagPro,cffyhfe,9,t5_2w7hh

604563,0,t3_212ji3,The first time I got on Mumble I was totally confused. Yes it is easy to ask for help but normally no one is actively in the root channel to help. Maybe I am being a bit OCD with it all but it irks me with all the congestion amp backup of channels and also when one person has their own aptly named dedicated channel. The Aussie and EU Mumbles are much simpler  I understand they have less users but the ratio of active users to Mumble channels in the US Mumble is very imbalanced. Most of the time  of the channels are unoccupied by active users and just overcrowd everything. I think a more simpler approach would especially help ease new users into PUGs amp Mumble in general.Edit Also I understand the Tournament Rooms are necessary and take up a decent amount of space. I have no problem with that at all as they are necessary with  man tournaments. There may be a few too many though but Id suppose ish tourny rooms would be adeqaute.,TagPro,cg8zq8j,1,t5_2w7hh

They would be even more likely to go that way if you added another boost just before the top layer of team tiles to make a quick boost route.  I can see how the bombs there might work for that but younger players in the rotation probably wont. The bomb in the base can only be used in one direction to get the flag up and that is with a high chance of death by spikes.  Maybe widen the gate and back it up or find a way to detonate the bomb without everyone flying away.In general the public do not like chasey maps Gloryhole was taken out the rotation just for this reason.  Maybe it is not as chasey s you said it was.

I never ever leave the enemy base if I dont know where the enemy FC is. Thats just asking to get capped on. Let your teammates yell about it all they want I simply dont trust them to stay between the FC and the flag tile. Ill do that and contain the FC long enough for them to get the return. If the FC gets the rolling bomb just try and line it up so he boosts you forward and you get a second chance to hit him or let him hit you into the flag. If theres a tagpro in their base youre gonna have a bad time. Leaving the base to chase when you dont know the opposing FCs position though isnt very conservative and safe play.,TagPro,chplx7r,1,t5_2w7hh

I liked it a lot and I think the other judges thought it had potential. DaEvil was still concerned about base size.

1417571,0,t1_citxak8,gt Im a strong believer in ping having little to do with skill in Tagpro. Thats the dumbest thing Ive ever heard.  Performance in TagPro is far more dependent on Ping than compared to a game like Starcraft. Tagpro turns to ass above  ping and it feels completely different with every  ping increment.  When OFM was exclusively on centra the west coast players were dominating and if Swingman hadnt played OFM they would have dominated even more.  I mean its less of a factor on chasey maps like Holy See or Colors but thats just because there isnt much interaction between players.The game could be made more tolerable at higher ping if player interaction was mediated through predictable elements so that raw ballonball juking was less of a factor.  This is why I have favored the suggestion of a fan that blows players around and why I put forth the suggestions of a flyswatter that could knock the flag out of a flag carrier as well as a cannon that shoots bombs.  I also think that the client side prediction percentage could be raised from  to .gt Many european players have done this exact thing. No they havent.  The only Euro who was good in America was orb and hes like the Christiano Ronaldo of ELTP.  Furthermore that was in S when the average player was mediocre compared to now.  In S Spiller drafted  Euros and howd that work out for him?  Id say about as well as Leeroys ELTP drafting strategy in the inaugural ELTP season.,TagPro,cityyvh,4,t5_2w7hh

1490551,0,t3_2b96mq,The NFLNBA have limitations like money and athletes physical ability declining with age that prevent you from just grabbing all of the good players and keeping them on the same team. You wont have enough money to sign them all and eventually players get old and you have to cycle though players anyway.In tagpro if you managed to get the top  players in the league to congregate on  team which admittedly would take some luck and skilled drafting then there would be nothing to ever break that team apart. In basketball if you have  major stars on your team and you draft a rookie who over the course of a couple season becomes a major star you probably wont be able to afford to keep all  big stars because you dont have the money or youre hitting the salary cap. One of them will leave to somewhere where they get compensated in accordance with their talent.There is no such incentive in tagpro so if you allow unlimited keepers its inevitable that stacked teams will form and never break apart. That along with the fact that there is a really random element of players disappearing or choosing to not play the next season makes tagpro somewhat different than basketball or football.The system we have right now isnt perfect by any means. Its been changing a lot every season.

There is an opposite teamgate in it with no button. Its only one tile wide it take sthe fc behind the enemy base and its not trivial to get trhough it with a lot of speed so hopefully its something that a defence can deal with in an otherwise pretty defensive base. The middle of the map has reasonably narrow chokepoints and there are a few options for an fc to switch paths but hopefully not so many that the map ends up being very chasey and hard to reset. There are a few boosts with only  pointed at the flag in each base and the rest more or less spaced out along the walls and not the middle.,TagPro,cjgpqpb,1,t5_2w7hh

Although I did win once as Captain .

1712754,0,t3_2e164x,This is Whitecaps strategy guide for Blast Off!This is a strategy guide for Blast Off!. However there is scant information online from the pros or the notsopros on it. So Ill post some stuff and you should feel free to add to it or debate what I write. Blast Off! is a great map to get people into the game because as the name implies theres a lot of blasting to be done as well as boostingand you can get across the entire map in a couple of seconds making recoveries pretty easy.BriefSpongeWalls nomenclature guide.Blast Off is a small and chasey map. Once the flag is obtained then holding it is pretty easy. I am sure that the team that has the most hold time in this game will win. OffenceSpongeWalls base bomb guide.For the bomb gtFirst just grab the flag and head to the bomb hit the wall and edge left while holding up to stay against the wall.gt Hold UP LEFT the entire time. This swings you through the middle where you can take the indicated boost.gt Hold UP LEFT and release after a second or two this swings you to the right of middle where you can also boost in as indicated.gt Hold DOWN LEFT and you can swing yourself to the bombs on bottom right where you can take the bombs as indicated and bounce in for a cap.A guide from Tagged of all of the boosts available in the map It has nearly every boost and then some. Some are stupidly obvious but a look at this map should hopefully generate some interesting boost ideas. We need basically  attacker on regrab all the time. Gnseng in the USContenders tournament was actually holding the button instead of being right on the flag. I dont know if it was worth it because you have to be careful from the boost in from either of the nearest corners. I didnt see anybody in the opposition get popped by it but maybe it made them a little wary? When our FC has the flag the best place to hang out is undoubtedly here There are three escape points so unless you are sniped there is no way for the opposing team to get you.Be liberal about grabbing the flag. Getting back into position is only a couple of seconds away and having the flag in this map is everything. Getting it is not easy but keeping it is dead simple...you can just run around the map forever! Again there are only  powerups so powerup management is super important.DefenceIm not really too picky about defensive positioning because the FC can come in from anywhere. Perhaps either side of the flag perpendicular to a line from the centre to the flag is best. The bomb in base must be diffused at all times! This is certainly the main avenue to either getting the flag or escaping with the flag for attackers. Be wary for the boost in from either corner. Attackers need to relay information about incoming opposition attackers re. rolling bombs bombs or boosts.Be prepared for some long chases and dont go in recklessly. Make sure you are flag side of an enemy FC if they are within range. Learn the boostsbombs as well because they will be used against you many times.,TagPro,cjv1zij,11,t5_2w7hh

Majority rule for default dates doesnt fuck anyone over as if a team isnt OK with the default date they can ask the other team to play at another time.. Yes I did. Read it.. No not really. Im asking to commissioners to change the structure of their current leagues. Much simpler.. No USContenders is very casual and badly managed not competitive. MLTP is competitive.Roster limits arent used by many larger more succesful leagues for the very reasons I stated. Read them. Anyway yes of course Im a troll.

1854905,0,t1_ckcpcya,Yea Pigoon suggested this too. My original point still stands. The committee I think has shown as a group multiple times that its struggled to differentiate between superior and inferior public rotation maps.I actually havent had issues with any of the maps theyve taken out so far except for Battery maybe but some of the maps in rotation now are strange to say the least and it seems based on evidence here that the committee wants them to stay. Im reluctant to state that the community doesnt want them in rotation because the dissenting voices including myself P  are always louder than those that approve. It just seems unlikely to me that the community wants something like Velocity to be removed over controversial maps but here the committee is discussing this very real possibility. ,TagPro,ckcpm3t,3,t5_2w7hh

1924360,0,t3_2gobtf,I wanted to share my thoughts on the maps I was able to help test sine I wasnt able to talk last night.Texas ShootoutI think this map is very good with one minor change. The base button should be o pointing into the base. This would make the one tile path easier but not very easy.DownforceI love the concept of the map but it defiantly needs cleaned up in the upper parts. The bombs are way to powerful and it feels crowded up top. One thing I didnt hear anyone mention is I think there should be a few more rows of team tiles in and around the entrances to the bases. Not completely filled but maybe  more rows.MonarchThis was my favorite map last night and other than the bottom portal being active its ready for rotation.IronThis is a great map that is very fun. How ever I think this would be very difficult to play in PUBs due to lack of communication for the gates. In groups however this map would be great. Also I feel that there should another row of team tiles as they require you to slow down to effectively use them and they only allow you to make the lost time slowing down to use them. Other than that its a very good map fit for PUGs.Overall I could see all of these maps in rotation with a few minor changes. I had a lot of fun and hope you continue to do this in the future.,TagPro,ckl2l7k,6,t5_2w7hh

Figured people would be more used to radio buttons not be uncheckable.

I only looked up the percentages because I had a major concern that this was the case. This conversation has evidently run its course because you are unable to rationally distil your love for the map into a coherent debate.

Really good powerup number and placement and rewards powerup battles. Offense has a lot of options to get around the map with basically one or two options for paths. All the boosts work as intended and you can pull off some pretty sick plays with them lookin at you Grail of Speed. Definitely can see why players would get frustrated if theyre not toplevel offense players or having to play it with mindless grabbing someballs.

2260508,0,t3_2l3kdr,I respectfully disagree. You are on the right path because there are  combinations of powerups ignoring order. However they can be organized in different orders so that you get  unique spawns.    For example on Boombox there are  different combinations of starting powerups. There are three combinations which are just one powerup spawned three times. There are six combinations which are one powerup spawned twice and one powerup spawned once. And there is one combination of each powerup one time.    In the case of one powerup spawned three times there is only one way to arrange them and that is to have that powerup on every spot. That comes to a total of  orders.    In the case of one powerup spawned twice and one powerup spawned once there are three ways to arrange them. For example if your two powerups are a rolling bomb and juke juice you can either have the juke juice on the left and the rolling bomb on the other two the juke juice in the middle and the rolling bomb on both sides or the juke juice on the right and the rolling bomb on the other two. So for each of these six cases there are three more cases. That makes  orders.    And with each powerup spawned once there are six ways to order them. That gives  more orders.    This comes to a total of  orders. Since there is only one way to receive three TagPros the odds are .,TagPro,clr4b4v,4,t5_2w7hh

I think that would look nice.  I dont have photoshop otherwise Id take my best stab at it.  All the circles could be cones.  and I bet you could make gates look niceish.  Too bad we cant have different gate textures based on the surrounding tiles.  You could make some really nice gates if we were able to do that.  Endzone tiles would be super cool polygon themed.  And team tiles.  The mars ball should be a big octagon.  Or decagon.  Or something with enough sides that it doesnt matter that its not completely pixel perfect.  Oh flags would be cool with like a line and a triangley thing on the end that looks fancy.  Spikes would be cool to make into like cones BUT with triangles in them!!  Also you should antialias your images so the edges arent as sharp and jagged and stuffWAIT NO mars ball should be like an ice cream cone or something that would be hilarious because everything else would be a cone and the mars ball would be an ICE CREAM cone not a geometrically one.,TagPro,cm2th0v,2,t5_2w7hh

2362106,0,t3_2mcwxs,I dislike it as far as pubs are concerned anyway. I dont think its just the chasieness I think Blast Off for example is still a lot of fun in pubs despite  being very chasey. In Holy See most flag carriers seem to head for either the bottom left or top right corners of the map once there they can just hide and wait. It usually takes around half a minute for two chasers to arrive and start pressuring the flag carrier until then the flag carrier can easily evade a single chaser by using a spike as barrier. On top of this there are so many powerups that rolling bombs and juke juices are pretty easy to come by further increasing the flag carriers longevity. In the end half the matches Ive played seem to be spent looking for a flag carrier waiting for another chaser hiding with the flag or waiting on regrab none of which is much fun.,TagPro,cm3o0i2,1,t5_2w7hh

2381679,0,t3_2mmd3u,There is no correlation and heres whyIn Three Body Problem your optimal strategy is to juke yourself.What?Yes its to juke yourself thats not a typo.  The bots anticipate your movements because your key inputs are instaneously known to the computer.  So by definition the bots go where you intend to go  they can calculate your range of possible positions better and faster than you can and intercept you.  The way you stay alive is to mislead the computer by selecting directional patterns that camouflage your actual destination.  In other words you have to go somewhere other than where you YOURSELF intend to go.Ive found that a fairly random series of key presses which slowly and somewhat unpredictably bring me closer to my target square work best.In tagpro on the other hand your objective is to juke your opponents who dont benefit from knowledge of your key presses.  You dont need to juke yourself you need to juke other humans who are operating with incomplete information.  To juke them you need to anticipate where theyll go and create pathways to avoid containment.In other words  juking a human opponent is about misdirection whereas juking the Three Body Problem bots is about confusion.,TagPro,cm630s6,1,t5_2w7hh

It is defined as wins divided by the total number of matches played i.e. wins plus losses. A draw counts as a  loss and a  win. Winning percentage is one way to compare the record of two teams however another standard method most frequently used in baseball and professional basketball standings is games behindgtFor example if a teams season record is  wins and  losses the winning percentage would be .. If a teams season record is  i.e. it has won twentyeight games lost sixteen and tied five times the team has participated in  matches. The five tie games represent  wins and  losses and so the team has an adjusted record of  wins and  losses resulting in a . winning percentage.gtIn baseball a pitcher is assessed wins and losses as an individual statistic and thus has his or her own winning percentage based on his or her winloss record A pitchers winning percentage is commonly expressed to three digits.gtInteresting Bob Caruthers | Player Winning Percentage | List of Philadelphia Phillies managers | List of Cleveland Spiders managers Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcmk oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecmk.

2557460,0,t1_cmscngx,Rightclick on and save each of these pictures so that you know what they are i.e. save them to an easilylocatable TagPro folder or just to your desktop if youre the cluttered type with the names StarWarsTiles.png StarWarsSpeedPad.png StarWarsSpeedPadRed.png StarWarsSpeedPadBlue.png StarWarsSplats.png and StarWarsPortals.png. PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE INCLUDED TWO TILES.PNG FILES because one of them has a glow around the lightsabers and the other does not. I prefer the glowing one because it makes the flags easier to see. You only need to save one of them whichever one you like best.Now go to your browsers extensions menu and search for TagPro Mod Manager and download it if you havent already. I use chrome. Then on your TagPro servers homepage look in your URL bar. You should now see a rainbowcolored flag to the far right. Right click that select Options. It should open a new tab with the different texture pack options  tiles speedpads splats portals. Ignore the flair option its virtually useless. Upload the photos you saved earlier to their respective Upload slots So click the upload button by tiles.png and upload the file you saved as StarWarsTiles.png then do the same for the other files. Click Submit and it should say Your mod has been installed! or something like that. Close out that tab hop into a game of TagPro and your tiles should look like mine now  Ive also been experimenting with a userscript that plays Dual of the Fates by John Williams during every game but Im encountering some roadblocks. Ill let you know if I get that ready to go some time.Edit I very much prefer this texture pack with NewComptes rotating balls script which can be added to TamperMonkey on chrome or GreaseMonkey on Firefox.,TagPro,cmsebth,2,t5_2w7hh

2652454,0,t3_2qbn84,Alright back to the grind. Heres Part II of my concerns. My only warning is that I might have forgotten a few big points by now its been like  hours or so. Lets get back to my problems with MLTP in its current state Lack of power separation In my opinion the current balance of powers and decisionmaking in MLTP is really messy for my liking. At its current state MLTP is some quasidemocratic institution that is built on way too many Half Measures. Its great that we have the public submit ideas every season but I honestly dislike what a lot of people have to say most of the time. However I cannot blame people for proposing the ideas that they propose. We dont properly communicate the problems that exist within the league and this hinders our suggestionmaking process. We should either give full communication of problems facing the league and take suggestions or do neither of these. Taking suggestions without telling anything isnt working. Lets be honest here there are some people who care a lot more about the rules rather than the organizational structure of the league. There are some who care more about the latter than the former. Id hope to see that the rules committee and the commissioners become separate branches with the player base being the third branch. From here we could try to balance out the power of these three groups. If we dislike having complicated power structures we could just move to having PrivateMajor be the clear ruler of the league Im fine with that I just want to know that hes doing that. Ill draw up some charts of what Im describing later. Its Christmas Eve and shit you know. I dont know why Im even doing this lol. Streaming Okay I said I would clarify what needed to be solved on streaming earlier now I will do that. Streaming for the most part has only a handful of quality streamers no offense. I just read the idea about teams having Flagship Streamers and honestly thatd be great. Heres how we can make it work we give teams an incentive to do this. We can give out tagcoins or waiver points or even money for the next auction draft based on streamer viewership so that a team committed to having a highlyviewed high quality stream each week will become better in the future.Our current system for streaming is weak for a couple of reasons. First off the MLTP streaming group too exclusive this is my fault since I created the original sub and this is being alleviated. Second off there is no definitive guide on how to get set up on streaming setting up basic slides like scoreboards should be on any MLTP stream. Third off the allocation of games was pretty much atwill at the end of Season . The only thing stopping people from taking a premier game was the fact that it was part of the unwritten rules to let the bigger streams have this. We need a better solution to allocate games. Here are the two ways in which the institution of at least MLTP streaming can branch off in the future. We organize streaming into a committee and seriously step up the way in which we allocate games.. We give streaming licenses to streamers to become flagship streamers of MLTP teams. This would be great for developing fans of certain teams.Both of these proposals should include a concentrated effort into promoting new streamers. Either way I think Streaming at least for MLTP should become its own department or section of MLTP organization.When it comes to competitive nonMLTP streaming Id like to see networks formed for the smaller leagues. Have a USC Network or an MLTP Network. Speaking of this maybe streaming should develop into a more formal institution like the MTC. Why not? Last point about streaming I strongly recommend people to start streaming pubs regularly at a decent hour. We need to have funwatchable streams of people playing TagPro Lets Plays etc. to get people into the game. There arent enough Lets Plays of TagPro right now. Minor League TagPro See my idea about the KeepSplit Solution The volunteer system This is one of the biggest things that irked me as a commissioner in Season . I was pretty much forced into doing this. Not only was this very slow and inefficient but most people who signed up quit their jobs anyways. The volunteer system is probably the biggest thing hindering all of the smaller aspects of MLTP from becoming efficient. It also kills our chance to create consistent hype. In my opinion we should take large swathes or sections of MLTP organization and create them into Departments or something similar. A person should be placed in charge here and they should run this since they would be skilled in that matter. i.e. Streaming Player Transfers Reddit Media etc. instead of having potentially unskilled volunteers run things that might just die out by the start of the season.Alright that was a huge huge part of my concerns. That however should cover everything in regards to MLTP. Let me wrap up the majority of this post by shifting my focus to the Dev Team.Out of all of the major institutions the Dev Team is far behind in development. Im sorry to say this but there is very little transparency in what is going on in the Dev Team. Although people like AnkhMorpork make great efforts to increase transparency the biggest problem is that there is a lack of active members of the DT. It would be best if the DT were to find a way to start picking up new members. Also maybe even pick up someone who isnt there to work as a Dev but rather to help with communication between the public and the DT. Right now I have no idea when TagPro will be released to Kongregate. If we want to keep people interestedexcited for the game we need to have consistent communication between the Devs and the public. Let me give you an example of a game that faltered due to poor DTPublic communications.The Story of Adevnture Capitalist Back in July when we were able to make pushes on rAskReddit I ran into a game called Adventure Capitalist in a thread. I ended up playing the game for about  or so months. At first the people were really excited about the game. People showered praise about how great the developers were at communicating to people. They always gave word about the upcoming updates and responded to peoples problems. However things started to get rocky when the developers announced the creation of version .. They announced that it would take about a month or so for the game to be developed and that they would port . to smartphones. At the time it was great. But soon enough the DT for AdCap stopped replying to people. Concerns were ignored. We were left in the dark about updates. By the time the game was supposed to be released we didnt hear anything from the DT. People got frustrated there were posts highlighting the massive lack of communication by the DT. Soon enough people started openly quitting. It took an extra month or so for . to be released but the game got boring at the end. Updates made to increase the endgame got sparser and sparser as people got stuck at certain levels of cash in the game. It took forever for people to progress. This is one of the reasons I quit the game got slow and I didnt hear much about new updates from the DT. Now this story can be applied to two different promises from the TagPro DT.. The promise of Open Sourcing TagPro in August . Never happened and no word on it.. The idea of pushing TagPro to Kongregate. I used a Kongregate game just to show how big DT communication will need to be if we ever have the game ported.At the same time we also might need some sweeping updates for the game to work better. People still have massive browserlagFPS issues with the game. Hopefully the rendering engine that is supposed to be released alleviates this problems. We might need to move to a ranked pub system to make sure new players arent destroyed when they first play. We might need to make the ingame moderator system stronger. But most importantly we need a Dev Team that is more active and communicative with the community. Im not sure if size would be better but Im also unsure if every member is contributing a lot right now.Alright that wraps up everything. One last point Id like to make we have waaaaay too many subreddits. The entire Reddit system is great but its way too decentralized right now. We might want to consider creating a website of some sorts. For every new subreddit we create for an ideaorganization the less interest itll probably get since we only have finite space on rTagPro to promote it. I might post a few old packets with some clear ideas about changing MLTP later but Im done for now. Ill reply to this post with any other concerns if I need to. Thanks for reading.Heres Adventure Capitalists number of plays as of December  . Thats right  million people. What do AdCap and TagPro have in common? Simple gameplay easy to get into. Its impossible to say that TagPro cannot succeed on Kongregate. Its also impossible to say that it cannot fail. We need to make sure the game is updated properly and has good institutions so the game can grow. I dont know about you guys but Id like this game to become big.,TagPro,cn4t1gj,3,t5_2w7hh

Ive always thought transparency is important when youre in a position of power  both before and after I was added to OLTP CommishMaptesting Committee.And yeah were talking about adding new members at the moment. There are a lot of people on the MTC right now who arent really consistently showing up to meetings so were trying to workout who still actually has the time to do it. Once we work out how many people weve got well probably start hiring more. And yeah MTC activity is definitely at its lowest.gt But I also think that you need to keep in mind that mapmakers spend a lot of voluntarily time on making maps as well.Yep. Theres nothing worse than spending  months on a map and having it shot down within a matter of minutes. Except maybe Rocketballs. Rocketballs is probably worse than that.I dont really think were biased though. But I do agree that MTC members do have a better chance. Its not because of our names or anything  its because we can hear absolutely all of the feedback and issues that the other MTC members have. I have stopped asking for feedback on other subreddits because I dont need it anymore when I can hear the feedback front and centre. I want to change this. Ive personally vowed to spend more time maptesting with people on Mumble and running through all the issues.If you have a map you want looked at try jumping on Oceanic Mumble and see if Im there.

Jelly makes a nice play to go through middle as his only hope to catch up to FC and makes a greatlucky play to hit bomb which goes directly into noob leaving base and bounces off his rolling bomb into the FC.

3214599,0,t1_cov5me3,The only thing to elaborate on is the technical details.I use the same VPN also at Hulzys recommendation and Ive since recommended it to other players.  Basically towards the early part of Season  my connection to Radius became downright awful  ping with packet loss after being pretty solid mid s for half a year or so.  The reason was that my ISP ATampT decided to route my connection west into Texas then into Arkansas then along the east coast and through several hops in New York City before finally making its way to Newark NJ.  I think at its worst it took me  hops total from where I live to Radius and for comparisons sake Ill note that it only took me  hops to get from here to Orbit.PrivateTunnel forces your connection through a different route that for some people happens to be more efficient than the route ones ISP uses typically because ISPs are cheap bastards and route data through lowestcost nodes rather than those with good infrastructure.  With my VPN I consistently connect to Radius in  hops max sometimes  or .  This means I have a smaller likelihood of dropping packets in addition to simply having lower latency between my location and the server.Ill also add that my ISP recently changed my routing again and now Radius is back to being playable without a VPN although still not as good as it once was.For anyone who has difficulty playing on a server due to abnormally high ping as in servers across the country are typically okay for you but one in particular is awful Id recommend looking into VPNs.  Before you commit to paying for such a service though look into where the VPN has exit nodes because thats where your connection will exit from and tends to dictate what route your signal will take.Also to see if your ISP is dicking you over with poor routing run the following command in Command Prompt or Terminal for MacLinux users then look up the various IPs youll see on a site like iplocation.com to get a rough estimate of where your signal is going.The command for Windows tracert tagproinsertserverhere.koalabeast.comThe command for MacLinux traceroute tagproinserserverhere.koalabeast.com,TagPro,cov70q7,3,t5_2w7hh

It doesnt have boosts it has team tiles for chasers and the bomb in the choke point make for a difficult entryexit. Obviously it can be the fastest route but only if used right.The powerup placement means that all areas of the map will be used and play can be pushed to the outside.Whilst its a fairly big map it wouldnt be particularly chasey as there are only so many routes.

4419566,0,t3_32qqgr,Hi Snaps I found your Macro extremely interesting. Thank you so much for sharing it.I was wondering if you would be willing to help me modify the script somewhat. I want to use your compound macro idea but change what the sentence is saying. I totally understand if you are unwilling. I have some coding experience but I do not know JS. However you might be able to point me in the right direction in terms of the part to changeI am trying to modify the macro so that it uses qweasd z as the numpad q  w   ... d   z  . Furthermore I only want to keep one potential sentence direction pup time.So in this language hitting wz would be translate to TOP pup . Is there a section of the code that I could use as a template to implement this? I have already experimented with   so I am aware of the key codes. The compound sentence part is what I am having trouble with.Thanks in advance if you are willing to give any advice and no worries if you do not want to. ,TagPro,csntiyt,1,t5_2w7hh

4516280,0,t1_cszv9y8,gt The problem is that the only qualifier to be on the MTC is to be cosy with the existing members of MTC. Thats it.There was some discussion on how members of the MTC are selected here How applicants get on with existing members may matter more than it should but according to the MTC that isnt the only factor.gt Take flame in which the MTC were shocked it was hated. The public do not care about how much you like the mapmaker only the quality of the map itself.Any evidence that they added Flame to rotation based purely on the mapmakers? As far as I can see they thought it was fun the public disagreed and they removed it from rotation pretty promptly.gt First weekend of each month the top ten voted maps of the new map thread are put in rotation no old maps. The public votes on those maps over the weekend top  get into full rotation. Whichever  are the lowest voted of the old maps get removed. easy.I dont think thats necessarily a great system. The top ten maps are going to be voted on almost completely based on how they look youre deluding yourself if you think the vast majority of players are going to try out each map which is what each member of the MTC apparently does. It would lead to maps that are immediately easy to play entering rotation anything that requires practice or requires players to adjust their playing style would almost certainly be dismissed there isnt time for that in a single weekend. Also your previous complaint was that the MTC is biased towards certain mapmakers do you seriously think the Tagpro community would be much better?gt And importantly make peoples map votes reset to ask again once a month else map voting is pointless on a kneejerk first impression.Id actually agree with this completely. Not only is it just based on first impressions but the ratings of people who stopped playing months back are still taken into account unless theres some sort of reset procedure I dont know about.,TagPro,cszx6jy,4,t5_2w7hh

4565653,1,t1_ct643br,II.He puts the bottle back in his pocket and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps he realizes that hes in trouble  hes not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding tottering steps he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks hes caught fire on the way down  like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth covers his face with his hands and waits to stop rolling.He stops at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadnt just imagined it.So seeing the large flat dark spot on the sand is still there he begins to crawl towards it. Hed get up and walk towards it but he doesnt seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesnt have water hell likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance.He gets closer and closer but still cant see whats in the middle of the dark area. His eyes wont quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling.Finally he reaches the area hed seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that hes no longer on sand  hes now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it  a pattern cut into the stone. Hes too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is  so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area.His mind detached in a strange way notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain or that this dark stone in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding punishing sun overhead doesnt seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface.Cool dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. Hes probably in the middle of a patch of sand already lying face down and dying and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then hell know hes gone.He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If hes going to die here in the middle of this hallucination he at least wants to see whats in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling.Its the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what hes hearing. He would swear that someone just said Greetings traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees but its too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different  he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds he catches his balance avoids falling on his face sits up and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time.Yep. He can see. Hes sitting in the middle of a large flat dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him about three feet away is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone at an angle.And wrapped around this white rod tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake looking directly at him.He stares at the snake in shock. He doesnt have the energy to get up and run away. He doesnt even have the energy to crawl away. This is it his final resting place. No matter what happens hes not going to be able to move from this spot.Well at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. Hell face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snakes direction feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment then goes back to watching the man looking into his eyes.Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadnt rattled yet  that was a good sign. Maybe he wasnt going to die of snake bite after all.He then remembers that hed looked up when hed reached the center here because he thought hed heard a voice. He was still very woozy  he was likely to pass out soon the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone. He still didnt have anything to drink. But maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didnt look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake was even their pet and thats why it wasnt biting.He tries to clear his throat to say Hello but his throat is too dry. All that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way hes going to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket and the bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isnt good. He doesnt have much time left by his reckoning before he passes out.He gets the lid off of the bottle manages to get the bottle to his lips and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around and then swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now.He tries again. Ignoring the snake he turns to look around him hoping to spot the owner of this place and croaks out Hello? Is there anyone here?He hears from his side Greetings. What is it that you want?He turns his head back towards the snake. Thats where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker hidden under the snake or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help.Please he croaks again suddenly feeling dizzy Id love to not be thirsty any more. Ive been a long time without water. Can you help me?Looking in the direction of the snake hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time he is shocked to see the snake rear back open its mouth and speak. He hears it say as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls forward face first on the stone Very well. Coming up.A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder wincing at the throbbing pain. Hes momentarily disoriented as he looks around and then he remembers  the crawl across the sand the dark area of stone the snake. He sees the snake still wrapped around the tilted white post still looking at him.He reaches up and feels his shoulder where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them  blood. He feels his shoulder again  his shirt has what feels like two holes in it  two puncture holes  they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake.Itll feel better in a minute. He looks up  its the snake talking. He hadnt dreamed it. Suddenly he notices  hes not dizzy any more. And more importantly hes not thirsty any more  at all!Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?Sorry about that but I had to bite you says the snake. Thats the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine.You bit me to help me? Why arent I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I havent had a drink for over two days. Well except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?No says the snake Im real. As real as you or anyone is anyway. I didnt give you a drink. I bit you. Thats how it works  its what I do. I bite. I dont have hands to give you a drink even if I had water just sitting around here.The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasnt talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great  he was still starving and exhausted but much better  he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again but only slightly. He felt hot in this sun but it was starting to get lower in the sky and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst.I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request continued the snake. I can guess why you drank it but Im not sure how much you drank or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. Itll make you go blind in a day or two if you drank enough of it.Ummm nnext request? said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.Thats the way it works. If you like that is explained the snake. You get three requests. Call them wishes if you wish. The snake grinned at his own joke and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.But there are rules the snake continued. The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility. The snake looks at the man seriously.,TagPro,ct645c0,-1,t5_2w7hh

4903159,0,t3_3i1b8u,Likes I think theres some as of yet undiscovered room for creativity.Dislikes It feels incredibly clunky to me. Another user mentioned that every boost route ends in spikes. I agree it seems to be spikes or walls almost anywhere I go. I have to forcefully adjust my routes mid boost to get something remotely close to where I wanted to go. Platypus is like the polar opposite  it tucks all boosts against walls and inconvenient structures forcing you one way and making you adjust before you take the boost while Rush seems to force you to adjust at some point during the boost. As my familiarity with it grows I anticipate these problems to dissipate to a degree. Regardless I still find it to be relatively boring and very chasey and its really nothing we havent seen before. Competitive viability is actually probably quite high. Better defenses can keep the flag in base longer reducing total time spent chasing. Once out of base though it could suffer from DZ syndrome to a lesser extent and its possible competitive games could result in lowscoring chase fests. It could realistically go either way.Its a decent map overall but its not innovative and I think Im mainly disappointed that a lot of better maps got overlooked in favor of this one.,TagPro,cuckxjg,5,t5_2w7hh

I suicide when I believe there is a good chance that someone on the enemy team will be able to tag me before I get to the center or if my teammates are ready for a hand off. Alternatively waiting for a pup or baiting the enemy team are reasons as well. Often times control is good in neutral flag but ground is also good. You have to decide based off the context whether you want ground or control. If you time it correctly you can get both. Thats why suicide is actually a great option.,TagPro,cuwh9vt,2,t5_2w7hh

5352110,0,t3_3obpgt,Im not sure I agree.  Good offensive D usually benefits from playing as closely to the flag as possible.  There are exceptions but as a general rule the further you are from the flag the less effective you become.  It is exactly for that reason that inbase defenders usually try to hold blocks as far from the flag as they realistically can to allow their FC plenty of room to get around the block.There are exceptions to this.  If the other team has a tagpro in base for example closetoflag offensive D is difficult since youll be quickly neutralized.  Or if youre being blocked  v  by competent defenders you may find it difficult to get close enough to the flag to be effective which might lead you to attempt to get an open field return instead.  Geo presents an obvious exception in the sense that there is a choke point below each base where its not unrealistic to expect to intercept a boost a large portion of the time.  But on an openfield map like Pilot for instance the main choke points mid bombsspikes are nowhere near the flag tile.Generally speaking your best bet is to play close to the flag  not because you expect to get the return but because you want to slow the FC down giving your teammates time to catch up and achieve the return.  In addition the closer you play to the flag tile the larger percentage of the perimeter of the flag tile you can obstruct.For instance if you are  tiles away from the flag youre only effectively blocking about  degrees of the perimeter.  In other words youre easy to get around.  But if youre playing one tile away you can effectively block  degrees of the flag tile making you really hard to get around which of course takes time which might enable your teammates to come help you.  And if you have two players on offensive D each covering a different side of the flag tile it becomes very difficult for your opposition to cap without a powerup or a forced flaccid.,TagPro,cvvsj9r,8,t5_2w7hh

5439962,0,t3_3phnpg,Obviously I dont dig the giant text box in the center bottom of the screen and I know that it will be addressed. But make sure that there is a way to turn off honking without turning the sound of the game off as I think some might get fairly annoyed with the constant honking especially after the new Dumb PucksSome Balls find the mechanic. Personally I think that the wind up or charge up of the boosts should be shortened slightly do about s or even half of the current time but i love that it spins up as you get closer. I agree that I also think that the acceleration is a little to high and should be brought down only slightly though. As for the popping sound if you decide to stick with pucks try dropping a hockey puck flat on the ground. Also the Go voice is a little to roboty and just doesnt sound clean. Also I think that when someone honks while you are still in the death screen you should still be able to hear it so long as you still have it on. I like the arrangement of the ping fps spswhats this? noobage and res up in the top corner but I think that the score should be moved back down towards the bottom like in Classic I liked that most of your information was centralized in one area and didnt have to look in  different places for all the information needed.

5860130,0,t3_3vhtlp,A few things I noticedquestions I have. You seem to completely stop moving and have your velocity go to  if you take hands off the keys. Is this true?. Players are darker when they just spawn. Is this some type of immunity when you first spawn?EDIT I read the words. Yes it is.. You are displaying different flairs as other players in game. What is the current plan for flairs? Will it be achievment based such as  caps in total play time gets you a lightening flair or how they currently are with total wins. Or something else entirely.. I see your velocity displayed in the corner. Will that be available? and it seems to max out at . when free moving. I believe movement is normalized now diagonal movement doesnt move you faster now is that still the case?. I see the three basic powerups in game still. Are there any plans to introduce more?. At the beginning of the first video there were two options. Play Game or Play Single Game. Is the second one to get put and kept in the joiner loop and the second to get put into one game then kicked to the main menu again?. How exactly does the chat work. It is always there in the background but you dont see the chat unless you manually pull up the chat menu?. It looks like the flag covers the entire tile now instead of a small circle within a tile. Are buttons the same way? they seem just a little smaller.. Also with boosts. Is it the entire tile or just the spinning yellow part?. Is there any plan to integrate a chat function within the game? Or are we going to stay with mumble or some other chat service.. At  in the geo video you and squrrily seem to get pushed as you spawn by something. Is this just a glitch?. There are now boost and bomb respawn animations are there plans to include a pup spawn animation?Thats all my questions now just some things I noticed and liked.. Honking!. The boostbomb path behind your ball to indicate speed. Bombs do not work though walls.. Bomb and Boost animations.. Flag grab animation where it kind of jumps to the center of your ball. How the background moves independently from the map you are on. I like the D Map is floating far above ground vibe it gives off.. The glass shattering and pop animation. The ball turning black after a grab for .? seconds to indicate immunity. The camera slowly moving  back after you dieBut whats with the gate glitch at the end of the geo video? Other than that it looks pretty good. I was a little nervous that Next would kind of ruin tagpro. But based on these videos I feel like I will like Next just as much as I do this game.

I think we can all agree this game amp community rocks but we all play with different levels of seriousness amp varying levels of skill.Unfortunately the community isnt quite large though to break into our own respective groups to enjoy the game the way we want it to be. There are noobs amp smurfs trash talking good guys and shit talking trolls. Some people play inebriated after a long day while others bleed for stats. When youre only communicating by chat amp playing such a frustrating game I can see how you could get carried away with the rage or typing too much in general. If you havent yet consider hopping on mumble to find players who like to type more amp will trash you right back without reports! For the record you dont have to have a mic to use it.

I usually hang around on Pi but make brief appearances on radius or origin depending on whos on where doing what and general serverping issues.  Ive been playing for quite a while now and have a good feel for whats okay and whats not okay and if you guys need people to enforce those things Im down.  I usually get around  hours in a week of tagpro although I do have small periods of a few days when I cant get on.  i.e. college gets really intense or real life issues come up but other than that Im your man!

Even if I was great at remembering power ups I still would be in favour of it being for everyone. Just my unpopular opinion. ,TagPro,czhow5b,6,t5_2w7hh

6502834,0,t1_czrxv99,Yeah overall Im pretty proud of how much the map rotation is improved.

6507295,0,t1_czse8sa,Well yeah of course and honestly this is something the MTC was proactive about. I went out of my way to schedule a meeting with Lucky because I was concerned and wanted to make sure we were hitting the goals that the developers had. We were concerned because we see both the incredibly vocal minority that doesnt like NF as well as the quiet but massive portion of the community that loves NF maps. And so we met with the developers to discuss the best way to balance that. Out of that meeting we came up with the  theory. From now on we will of course will continue to monitor map ratings and community feedback but you commenting on this post as one of the many doesnt really help me improve the map rotation. Where did you come up with a  number? I can tell you where we got the  number. Its easier to understand things and take feedback when there is some sort of reasoning behind them.  ,TagPro,czsejgq,3,t5_2w7hh

6572111,0,t3_45n6cy,There have been a lot of great responses so far but none have yet to cover what I think is the key element of juking which is rhythm and timing. Every player you come across will have a unique reaction time. Whenever a juke doesnt work you should ask yourself Do I think he reacted to quickly or did I make my second cut before he could properly react to the first? This is especially important in pubs where you will often face noobs and allstars over the course of the same hold. ALso people here are saying slow down. I have always had much more success going full speed and attacking the defender. It forces them to make a quick decision which generally results in them making a poor decision.,TagPro,czz3zzu,2,t5_2w7hh

6577734,0,t1_czz9sem,Wrong. If a defender is very aggressive faking a direction can cause them to fling moreso in that direction than you. Therefore giving you more space.They expect left but you want to go right. You fake left and they think yep just like I thought and fling left. Then suddenly you switch your direction right most likely by using diagonal movement to accelerate faster and then you have way more space to work with and likely youre out.,TagPro,czzowmi,3,t5_2w7hh

7187950,0,t1_d1v0i2n,Not to be a wiseass but basically everybody?Defenses can murder anybody coming ingoing out and regrabbers can murder fcs who have taken the team boost out of base. Because you can basically only boost into the spike tunnel. I dont think you necessarily have to remove the tunnel but as others have mentioned I do think only having one bomb in base might help. I think its great to have a high riskhigh reward path but I think having two bombs just tilts the scales too much towards risk. Because in pubs you may not know if the bombs are there or not until its too late.And Ive only played the map a few times but the thing that annoys me about the bombs is that it makes getting resets chaotic. I basically have to assume I cant return to base via bottom and as I try to go around top or through the boost the regrabber can just bomb me all over the place. To me its like if the bases on wormy were flipped with the two bombs facing the middle. Every time someone came back to get a reset the fcregrabber could just send them flying. I feel like thats happening a lot on this map. Maybe you could make the yellow boost a little easier to grab with and just have one bomb? That way there would be elements to help offenders grab but it wouldnt be quite as chaotic?All that being said Ive only played it a few times. Id never call for some massive overhaulremoval without playing it a lot more. So Im not trying to be overly critical.

7350118,0,t1_d2dl65c,The fact of the matter is that most of us joined during a push where like half the balls in the game or more were new like us. Its hard to relate to the new balls now as most come here at random and they are literally the only new ones around. While it is important to try to remember that new balls occur its also hard to get used to the idea for some players that not every ball in a game will have extensive experience. Besides I was never that bad when I first joined. sAlso it is just a game. A factor that many people forget. New balls often are not joining games with the sole intention of winning they are joining because they found a new ball game and wanted to have some fun. Sure winning is great but the key to things in the beginning is fun. Telling them strategy is not really all that helpful unless they want to make the effort to improve and not just have fun in an online game from time to time. But it can be hard to tell which of the new balls are willing to make the effort to increase their winning chances and which are just here to have a ball.,TagPro,d2dnpfd,2,t5_2w7hh

7501474,0,t3_4i3ovr,Awesome write up thanks for analyzing the data and putting out the survey to begin with! If you dont mind me giving the anthropological perspective and stepping on the anthropology soap box for a moment I might be able to shed some light on some of the cultural elements to the issue. I cant speak much for discovering new ways find new players but I can give you some of the casual observations Ive made that I think might speak to what youve presented here. Wall of text incoming I apologize in advance.Youve brought up some great points in your discussion and I think the results validate what a lot of players have been suspecting for a while now I just didnt realize the numbers were so extreme . Discovering some method of reaching out to new players is something that we can brainstorm and through trial and error come up with a solution but I think a potentially larger issue were facing here is retention simply because it requires changes in behavior within a well established community.I think youve done well with identifying the problem harassing new users is something the players are unfortunately well aware of through personal experience and the frequent reports here on the subreddit from frustrated new players whom I imagine represent a much larger portion of new player experience than we realize Im sure not every scrub is willing to make such a post to our community after repeated harassment from it. I know I wouldnt. Coupled with the albeit justified assumption of someballs as smurfs generally speaking theres a lot of hostility towards the few new players we have. My take on it is an issue of accountability that the new ingame moderators we were promised however long ago would have done a lot to alleviate. Although at least on sphere I dont play enough on other servers to attest to this players often call one another out on general douchebaggery it quite frankly shouldnt be on the players themselves to regulate or apologize for the behavior of the often repeat offenders. That being said if our more illtempered players received a lot of backlash every time they lashed out at a player perhaps they would be less inclined to do so. I would strongly encourage players to condemn that hostility whenever they see it. Public shaming goes a long way to discourage unwanted behavior as well as showing new players that type of harassment is not typical of the community as a whole. gtDont smurf as a Some Ball.Fucking thank you. I personally dont care in the slightest if you want to smurf but doing so as a some ball invalidates legitimately new players who dont understand the mechanics of the game much less the strategies weve developed over the years the reason for the hostility seeing as they likely assume you know theyre new as theyre automatically named some ball or even fucking know what a smurf is to begin with. A simple how long have you been playing? goes a long way to facilitate growth by giving an avenue for communication to more experienced players potentially extends a welcome and publicly identifies new players to everyone in the game. Perhaps a smurf option instead of the default some ball would help in this area either giving players a randomly generated name which could be fun or just a simple smurf. But I would definitely second this notion.I think what these numbers show is that this game as it is today is relatively unique our population is at a sweet spot where were large enough to still meet players you dont already know but small enough and more importantly well established enough to be very tightknit. When someone stops playing its more than losing a player its someone departing from our community someone weve gotten to know over months or years of playing and communicating with. We had our own secret santa exchange. Longterm romantic relationships have been established. We watch movies and shows together drink together and watch one another play a game that weve grown to love. We have a really fucking tightknit well established community here and as a side note I think we owe a lot to the developers and all of our moderators for facilitating such an amazing community. As an example look at the response from sphere after the April fools joke the solidarity and anger that came out of potentially losing the focal point of our community was very real. All of this to say it can be remarkably intimidating for a new player to try to find their place in such a close community. Especially on top of learning the game itself the frequent hostility and observing other players interact with one another ingame who clearly know each other past name recognition I think the closeness of the community itself can work against our retention of new players. Personally I was all but about to drop the game two years ago until a player made a point to reach out and say hi in game I dont think we should so readily dismiss the lengths such a small gesture can have for keeping a player coming back. The best thing we can do is show new players that were inviting that they have something to gain by participating. Although it can be obvious to see that were friendly towards one another if we dont make an effort to extend that attitude towards new players theyre going to feel excluded. The combination of this and the harassment from frustrated players can potentially comes across as we dont want new players.On a cultural level I dont think were going to convince many of the hostile players to stop harassing others for simple mistakes I think we need to empower other users to call that shit out and make every effort to invite new players to check out the server subs really encourage them to download mumble which is intimidating as shit at first for someone with social anxiety by the way!! and generally have a welcoming attitude.Mechanically we need those new ingame moderators. Something to identify smurfs rather than new users who already feel the spot light in a seemingly tightknit community. We need to make community building platforms outside the game more accessible and more importantly less intimidating. Our solidarity is amazing and if we can show that were equally as welcoming and inviting ingame it would encourage people to want to join the conversation outgame and make those social connections. And encourage players old and new to come visit those regional subreddits!I want to also give a shout out to sphere and encourage anyone and everyone to come join us over at rspheremasterrace and say hi and make a couple comments. We might be going a bit stircrazy from the lack of new people but I promise you wont find a more friendly and supportive group of people on the internet. Ill stop it there since its late as hell and Ive already written such a wall of text I dont think many people will read it to begin with. Might come up with something else after some thought just my initial reactions sorry if Ive rambled Ive been drinking  OP if youre interested Id love to look at the raw data and run it through AtlasTI when I have some more free time.

Point  is ok if there are no teammates in sight or the enemy is closer but if you clearly see that they can get there and take it then it is a great advantage for your team to do so. I agree that making this judgement isnt something that newer players will be great at but they need to try it to learn dont they?Point   maybe this is a Chord thing but most anyone will wait for a v and I would really like for it to stay that way!Anyway on top of all this I just want to say that its very reasonable to not expect new players to give a shit about what we tell them for the first  games or so.

The ingame tutorial is fine but possibly having an integrated voice chat would also be beneficial for improving the quality of PUBs but also add toxicity? where new players get their start to keep them hooked.  These things couldshould all be in the pipeline for development for Tagpro Next but that doesnt mean the Devs cant work on these things to deploy in Classic where they can refine and test before moving the base code to Next.  Supposedly the Devs started on Next because they knew the community would disagree with normalized movement but that doesnt mean that Classic cant use some of the new features intended for Next as well.I really love this game and I appreciate all the Devs have done for the almost  years Ive been playing but I cant keep myself from feeling frustrated over the lack of progress.  I had planned on making a  donation when Next was released but at the rate things have been going I may likely end up quitting well before then.

9783795,0,t1_daj17t3,rGames is a lot smaller and most people browsing it are looking for discussion on games news on games they already know about or if theyre looking for games to play it generally doesnt include browser games. I mean posting there and being within the rules doesnt hurt anyone and will probably help our numbers to some extent. But past posts there havent been anywhere close to the returns from askreddit.A potentially more fruitful approach tho its harder and with a lot more rejection would be to contact gaming journalists directly with a novel but honest approach since youd get coverage on gaming sites which could then be posted to rGames and other gaming subreddits anyway. A similar approach could probably be used to contact popular but not too popular youtubers and twitch personalities. Getting exposure on a default is almost always preferable simply due to numbers even if the peg is more square than preferred. Heck getting a successful post on rTwoXChromosomes would probably give TagPro a significant boost for months. If our peg doesnt fit into any of the most attractive holes its worth looking into if theres a way to adapt it a bit to get it trough a couple of those holes IMO.,TagPro,daj2e13,1,t5_2w7hh

9809158,0,t1_dalnfxl,ampgt Also look at buddhism and hinduism. Get on their asses and tell them to stop using swastikas. They arent even using them as satire theyre entirely serious about it.Ok I should assume youre trolling with this comment but Im responding as if youre not because there can be a lot of ignorance towards this by many people.The swastika was powerful hindu and buddhist symbol for many many years and only meant positive things. It was unfortunately appropriated by the Nazis and turned  degrees. Since then its been associated with hatred.While I understand a position that using it in proper context should not be vilified it is nevertheless accepted as antisemetic in its everyday use within western culture. This is inarguable.With that in mind its only appropriate to not use it. However implying eastern cultures should be told to stop using it is entirely disrespectful since its theirs.Now if you are trying to make the argument that youre using it entirely for your personal religious beliefs then I would have to concede a bit to that point  but in the same breath someone in western civilization who would consider using a symbol that denotes god positive energy or good luck  should also know that the chances to offend are much greater and would in fact cause the exact opposite of the meaning they should intend in using it.In other words its a dumb hill to die on and youre being consciously offensive in even trying to defend this.Show some respect to others and dont ever think that using a swastika in any context ESPECIALLY one that nods to nazis specifically is a light joke.

10080786,0,t1_dblium5,youre not giving yourself enough credit. man i wish we could just stop a moment and think for ourselves instead of joining the crowd.wormwood was great in my honest opinion. the thing is the playerbase wasnt ready for it. it required an entire meta change nobody was willing or patient enough for that to occur. its not even about being different or even innovative its a wellthoughtout idea that shouldve arrived way long ago. it looks simple on first glance but when you go deeper into it it turns into a really challenging and fun neutral flag experience.i myself was ready to spend hundreds of hours playing wormwood and i know for certain i wouldnt get tired of it. such concept deserves to be explored further youre guaranteed to find new things along the way. and i can only hope its revived for competitive leagues when they come around implementing neutral flag mode with the normal mode. ELTP is already looking into that for next season. im really looking forward to that and i hope they look into wormwood as one of the leading candidates.,TagPro,dbljojz,3,t5_2w7hh

Especially with the private vs public ones. I can predict most play public because thats where they have more chance to play. If you mostly play private you have to schedule playing with people which causes problems when people cant play. So what do they do as alternative? Pubs probably.

11356795,0,t1_dfj567q,gtOn the same note chasers have more freedom because the flag carrier has to avoid choke points i.e. getting contained. The only advantage the fc has is boosts and bombs but having those right next to the flag is more often something youd see on a bad map. Just because you cant fully commit into getting the return doesnt mean the regrab has to camp the flag tile. And like I said in the previous post just because the re sees less action doesnt mean its a bad mechanic. Ive already went through that so Im not gonna repeat it here.Thats only in certain situations. Most maps popular CTF maps in rotation does not have choke points that gives a significant advantage to a chaser in most cases. Iron arguably has a couple in the top middle and Scorpio sort of does at the portal. Outside of that you have Constriction and Smirk which both have chokepoints where generally a boost will be available to the fc if they reach it first to easily escape it but its also a very optional route anyway. Maps with a significant amount of chokepoints have traditionally not done well in rotation.Im not making an argument about what can be done on regrab. Im making an argument about what practically happens for most players. Leaving regrab is a risky proposition if youre not fully confident in what youre doing and able to follow through. Couple that with a rise in toxicity and competitiveness in PUBs and youll quickly learn that taking risks like that is not appreciated unless youre well known.I dont understand your comment about bad maps. Looking through the current rotation I struggle to find any map that doesnt have a boost or bomb close enough to the flag for an average player to get nubbed by a boost or bomb an average regrabber wouldnt fully account for when they start to stray off the flag tile.The only interaction you have with the game is through moving your ball. Re encourages you to do the opposite of that. I dont understand how a concept that goes straight against all of the interactive options the game gives you is not a problem.gtThe main reason why its not something that suits TagPro is because you make the flag and the bases a dynamic element while keeping all the others static. The games we played ended up a clusterfuck because  of the time people die near spikesboostsbombgates which creates a chaotic situation in which the map elements suddenly start being OP or straight up gamebreaking. TagPro maps are designed with the stability of all elements functioning the same way  of the time. Making the most important one the flag change place ruins that and makes it way too chaotic compared to the simplicity it had in mind when it was made. The games were run on mumble and the voice chat resorted to everyone shouting where the flag is because thats all the depth the game had. It was very similar to NF in that regard but with NF you at least have one flag to focus on not to mention the static map. With no coms in public games it would be even more confusing. Thats without even touching on obvious problems like spawn locations or flag carriers kissing. Its an interesting idea for sure. One that when better thought through can lead to a fun version of TagPro. However regrab isnt a problem that requires drastic changes to the game. Its not a problem at all actually.Nowhere did I claim this should be put in as is. Just that the games I hosted with the devs on NA mumble proved that this was a fun concept that showed a lot of potential that still feels like TagPro without the noninteractivity that regrab tends to bring to the game and if fleshed out could very well elevate the game beyond what it is now. In addition to that the point youre responding to explicitly addresses the main complaint you seem to have about the mode. Comms are not really an issue and can easily be countered by things like flag indicators and things like spawn location and fcs kissing would be very possible to find fair solutions to with some trial and error.gtIn your initial argument you say that you think people like regrab because they are used to it which adds nothing to the discussion because it doesnt say anything about whether or not its a good mechanic. Its just generalizing one side of the problem and assuming people opposed to you are not basing their belief on logical base. This is what people use when discussing timers and I just really dont care for that.I dont know why you take such an issue with the statement. Its literally just stating why regrab is a thing. If the game was designed to counter regrab from the start Id be extermely surprised if anyone would have ever missed regrab in the game simply because it would have never been a thing. Any snark in that comment is directed at the comment Im responding to if that offends you.gtAs for the actual point again your alternative with the flag walking back to base doesnt make it any more intuitive but rather even more confusing and chaotic which for a new player can be overwhelming. With TagPro mechanics already being hard to master adding difficulty to the actual gameplay wouldnt help people stick around. So were back to the point about lack of valid alternatives.The flag walking back to base is about as intuitive as it gets as the flag will visually and mechanically show the players what it does. I think the only real issue as far as TagPro mechanics goes is that TagPro maps are currently rigid which has forced the elite players to be very accurate and deliberate with how they move their balls and use the map elements since beyond balltoball interaction there is a limited amount of highleveldecisionmaking involved theres not a lot of surprising moves a player can do in a game that doesnt involve highlevel mechanical abilities. This is really only a problem to encounter if youre a new player against vets and should be alleviated by a healthy amount of new blood along with matchmaking. Considering how much untapped potential there was in TagPro mechanics when we first started playing and how chaotic and random games were it never seemed to be a problem as far as new players went as  of the growth in the TagPro userbase came from a period when noone had more than a basic clue of what to do so if changing how flag respawning works does that again and is coupled with a surge of new players for instance through a steam release Id be very surprised if that turned out to be a problem.gtI get your point about Melee but again what is your alternative? Its just what TagProSmash Bros is... a simple indie game. Fighting regrab wont change that. None of the points youve mentioned would change if youd make flags walk back to base. You cant expect it to be FIFACoDRocketLeague. And if you do youre gonna have a lot more than regrab to change.I certainly never indicated anything that would suggest I think remove regrab  CoD popularity. Im not sure who youre arguing against here.My original argument was about how regrab has essentially neutered a lot of avenues about mapmaking and thus turning the game stale. Is there an element to that argument about popularity? Sure but in a very limited way. TagPro has a lot to do if it is to get millions of players but I was never making that argument. The alternative that youre asking for is that we dont just cater to people who have played the game for  years if we want new blood. Veterans know what they like and what theyre used to but generally have little understanding for how a new player sees the game. If we want TagPro to be attractive to new players we have to consider the new players viewpoints. If not thats fair but thats also how you end up adding more nails to the coffin with this one which is what I originally responded to.gtIf the technical aspect of TagPro can be reworked to be more nbfriendly e.g. matchmaking and we can find a way to bring in a solid number of people too low and it wont work then theres nothing holding the game back from being relatively successfulWith a big enough pool of people to reach out to thats probably correct. I still think the game will keep being stale if the gameplay keeps being untouched giving maps little room to do anything about that but it wont surprise me if the current community prefers that.,TagPro,dfj9soq,1,t5_2w7hh
