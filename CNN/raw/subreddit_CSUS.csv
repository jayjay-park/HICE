296830,0,t3_1xi1sv,Thats quite the commute to make honestly. About  miles IIRC and getting over the causeway during rush hour will be hell.

1391211,0,t1_ciqhgt2,Well you need both of those for sure but paying cash for rent is something you should stop now. Use a cashiers check at least or get some checks. You need a record of that stuff. Anyway maybe if you could show that rent was very difficult to make like with paystubs or cash deposits why you should NOT pay rent in cash and then show your actual expenses you might have another reason to show. You have to also explain what youve done or are doing to clean up your act. Start with bank checks... b,CSUS,ciqo3vm,1,t5_2saj8

9167170,0,t1_d8dze4m,Well good job.I have some advice since it sounds like youre relatively new to college. The thing that will help you now and in the future is putting together a strategy for studying. The absolute best method that a friend shared with me is this Notes Study Groups Copy Review. NOTES Take notes during class of what might be on the exam. Ask the teacher what youre responsible for and what youre not. COPY After class copy down these notes into a cloud storage like Google Docs Google Drive. STUDY GROUPS Socialize with your fellow students and organize study groups. Share your GDocs files with these students and encourage them to contribute on fleshing the notes out. If any of you ever miss class you can always get the notes from the Gdocs drive. REVIEW Once every week review the notes. By reviewing them you reinforce and persist this information. Studies have found that periodic review of study notes cements them in your memory.,CSUS,d8e07z2,2,t5_2saj8
