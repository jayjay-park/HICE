I dont really want to see Batman turning people into gory chunks but we also all saw what happened when they brought the Mortal Kombat characters down.

They took something people regard as the token hand waving it away and actually made it a part of the narrative. Could have easily been okay they get the pills rly quick take them and then they never talk about them again but the pills have actually gotten a fair amt of focus on a couple of occasions including what they went through to get them in the first place.,INJUSTICE,dfb89ln,7,t5_2rkvc

I think Flash will still be a rush down type character and his accessibility makes him a good pick for newcomers so I would say give him a shot too. More than anything though if you havent played IGAU the combat system is different from MKX because of the character power button. This turns it into a  button fighter vs. a  button fighter like MKX. I think most of the unfamiliarity with IJ will come from this rather than actually getting to know the characters. ,INJUSTICE,dg65zu1,1,t5_2rkvc
