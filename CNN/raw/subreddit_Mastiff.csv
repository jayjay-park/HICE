1837743,0,t1_ck9lkoo,Hi! Thanks for your comment!Honey has super bad arthritis and hip dysplasia so she doesnt go outside except for to go potty we live on the second floor and I hadnt noticed how bad they had gotten. Its tough to get them short on carpet. Please dont think Im making excuses just explaining. I took the picture down because it was embarrassing! I dont want people to think we neglect our babies and shes got an appointment for a hair do and manicure tomorrow. Thanks for pointing that out. ,Mastiff,ckan7fl,1,t5_2tlyc

2684011,0,t3_2qohhy,Its actually our second mastiff. I cant believe how much they just want to be lap dogs its like a trait of the breed that and not going for a walk too far or youll regret it. Our first mastiff was the greatest had posted some photos of here but sadly he got the stomach flip and bloat just after his th birthday. theyre really like special need adults than a dog. Ive done training with and know I could do more with dazy but its hard with how loving she is. these rules Ive seen many places couldnt be more true The Mastiff is never allowed on the furniture.Okay the Mastiff can get on the old furniture but not the new furniture.Okay the Mastiff can get up on the new furniture until it looks like the old furniture and then well sell the whole damn works and buy new furnitureupon which the dog will most definitely not be allowed.The Mastiff never sleeps on the bed. Period.Okay the Mastiff can sleep at the foot of the bed.Okay the Mastiff can sleep alongside you but hes not allowed under the covers.Okay the Mastiff can sleep under the covers but not with his head on the pillow.Okay the Mastiff can sleep alongside you under the covers with his head on the pillow but if he snores hes got to leave the room.Okay the Mastiff can sleep and snore and have nightmares in bed but hes not to come in and sleep on the couch in the TV room where Im nowsleeping. Thats just not fair.The Mastiff never gets listed on the census questionnaire as primary resident even if its true. ,Mastiff,cn8x54h,3,t5_2tlyc
3293877,0,t3_2xtkk8,So freakin gorgeous! I have a  year old Presa and I love how majestic the two breeds are. Side note have you seen the Kanye Corso meme out there? I cant find it right now but my buddy has a Cane and he sent it to me. Its just a big ass Cane with Kanyes face superimposed but its hilarious if you can find it. ,Mastiff,cp3q8g5,2,t5_2tlyc
3420601,0,t3_2ze6bm,Hopefully someone has more experience with mastiffs and heart murmurs but I can say theyre pretty common in humans and often either resolve on their own or are benign. Id consult with a private vet of your choice though just to cover your bases. Good luck!,Mastiff,cpi6923,2,t5_2tlyc

5344675,0,t1_cvuq01j,Well usually do a lap around the block and then drop the mastiff out and then continue with the husky. Or Ill do a solo walk with the mastiff and a solo run with the husky. Luckily the mastiff mellowed the husky out significantly.,Mastiff,cvuubsw,2,t5_2tlyc

Heres another  If you were wondering or judging he is NOT suffering. Far from it. He gets a roast cooked every day. We would never let him suffer and when the time comes that he turns that corner we will make him as comfortable as possible when he crosses the rainbow bridge...,Mastiff,d1eypqj,9,t5_2tlyc

8541279,0,t3_4wr6nl,I take my English to the dog park when its cooler out. Shes great with other dogs. I raised her from  months to be social and easy going. If another dog gets aggressive she runs to me instead of picking a fight. Its pretty funny when a chihuahua is barking at her and being a dick and her  lbs ass is hiding behind me. The only thing Ive had a problem with are other dog owners being skittish around her because of her size. Yes shes big but shes also a baby and just wants to say hi. Shes not threatening in the least but some people are just scared when they see size.,Mastiff,d6988nn,5,t5_2tlyc
10042473,0,t3_5jeczf,that is a really interesting mix. have you had any issues with hips etc?does he have pointy ears like the GSD? oh man I need more pics!,Mastiff,dbgk6ib,2,t5_2tlyc
10698545,0,t1_ddjfmw9,Thats what the vets have always told us. Plus it keeps the weight off them as they get older which is also better for their joints.,Mastiff,ddjh4fg,1,t5_2tlyc
