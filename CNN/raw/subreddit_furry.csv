660428,0,t1_cgf82bd,Wow thanks for taking the time to write such an insightful post. While I agree with you for the most part that furries can be transparent. But there are people in the gay community that can be described as such as well? Plenty of websites have gays and applications that get right to the point. No fems no twinks etc.Also everyone has their own sexual fetishes. For example a straight dude can have an affinity for feet? But obviously that attraction is specific to female feet in this example. So people can have attractionsfetishes to certain thing but still in the limit of their sexuality.What I discovered about myself last night was that in fact that my sexual fantasies carry over into furrydom. Does that make me a furry?Honestly now that you raise an interesting question Im not sure about that anymore. ,furry,cgfc9md,1,t5_2qi2h

718071,0,t3_22bo3v,Draw? Make Blender models of in my caseAnd I started because I told myself to. I had no particular ideas other than imma make a warhammer And thats still how I come up with my ideas. Why do I do it? Because I feel that its a cool skill to learn and because Ill eventually be okay at character modeling. Then ill be able to create my sona. Which will be cool. I had recently heard of Blender through me getting into digital art in the form of fractals in Apophysis. God this was  years what th of my life ago? anyway while looking around for info on general digital computing I encountered Blender and Sintel which was under development. This phase of Blender felt really quite clunky and I never got much into it. But I paid attention to Sintelbecause dragons are the best species.I messed around with it once Sintel came out every now and again. But never got much beyond a few stupid Suzanne animations until my Junior year in High School. When I realized I had to take another art class to graduate with Honors. I decided to rather than spend my whole semester doing something becuase the teacher told me to I managed to convert it to an Independant Study of d modeling. So I spent an hour and a half every day usually utterly failing at the projects simply because they were too large to handle. I pumped out a Hydralisk that while impossible to rig and animate due to awful topology was still completely fucking awesome I wish I had kept onto it. That project brought my grade up to a C and the teachers note unproductive in class to an A with the teachers note takes on too big of projects.Once finished with the class I dropped Blender again. I only picked it up recently after I joined the fandom because now I have the goal of creating my sona in it.Ive had to relearn a bit of what I lost and now I have to learn character Topology which is an absolute disaster for me. Its often a painful process learning Blender. But im getting there. I kinda went off on a tangent here. But the whole Sony versus Sintel debacle got me thinking about the role that video played in my artistic career. And very very angry at Youtube. TLDR Im trying to learn Blender becuase I think itd be cool to do and ill get to create my sona in it eventually.,furry,cglwcg9,3,t5_2qi2h

Ive met intelligent socially welladjusted people who talk some of the kinkiest stuff you ever heard in private and Ive met some dim bulbs who think theyre superior for having transcended base and hedonistic desires... or something. My preferences are what they are... but any reasonable person knows when to bring them up and when to leave them alone. Ultimately furries are still people. People are people and labels are just labels. If youre truly not happy calling yourself a furry then dont  its just a label and the label only describes your interests. A group of skeevy people shouldnt change your interests I assure you after nearly  years being around the fandom my interests havent changed even though my outlook on the fandom has. I havent always wanted to call myself a furry but I dont have an issue with it now. I agree with Tobias Ive also noticed a shift in the fandom in recent years... but I still continue to meet great people here almost every single day.

I do enforce an anti Magic and Powers rule while in the bar so that no one is OP or too silly. I hope that answers your question and well see you soon. P.S.

1084681,0,t3_26iwuf,Shapeshifting when presented properly can be furry. I consider my WoW troll druid to be furry simply because I want him to be and theres a level of anthropomorphism in the feral form.Just as we have feral creatures in art all the time in the fandom. Hell the mascot at the top of our page is feral. Itd be difficult to say that only things that are bipedal are furry with how common feral art is. Now like everything here it can be presented in a way thats furry or not furry. depending on the attitude and the way the shapeshifting is treated. For example I wouldnt really place the classic werewolf that transforms into one on a full moon and wipes out a village to be furry. However after that the Skyrim werewolf attribute where the player has full control of hisher actions would be as theres a level of control and therefore anthropomorphism in it. Its not terribly furry but it is furry. ,furry,chrkwi2,3,t5_2qi2h

1541079,0,t3_2bvq91,The key to kickstarter success is reaching as many people as possible. If youre concerned with not leaving a Google trail then kickstarter is not going to work for you. That said you cant really use kickstarter for anything which would be very offensive anyway. Their policy prevents it.Your best bet for promoting a game is to have people play it. Go to conventions. If your game is furry related furry conventions and furmeets are probably a good choice! I created Kitsune of Foxes and Fools and succeeded at my kickstarter project by going to convention after convention. Since then Ive continued to go to  or  per month to keep building awareness of my game and brand. I actually started with anime gaming and general scififantasy cons and then later realized that with fox spirit main characters I would find a receptive audience in the furry community and boy did I!.Forget hiding your identity if youre going to promote a kickstarter. However consider that running a kickstarter project is going to look great on your resume even if you have to go look for some other job. Its a leadership credential and sets you apart from others. What you want to do is make sure your given name is more easily searchable with professional projects such as this kickstarter and not publicly easily associated with any fursonas you have commissioned lots of porn of or whatever.,furry,cj9g5lv,3,t5_2qi2h

Well update that accordingly.The deposit is on a casebycase basis depending on addons ordered because those materials cost extra. Its not always  like many fursuit makers charge.Our prices are low because as we state on the website we consider it a small service to the community. For example many contribute their time to community service with no payment at all but the reward of seeing people happy and enjoying themselves. As far as living goes we both dont have house payments and I have a job that pays enough to cover any foodcarliving expenses I have. These funds will go towards student loans for my mate and savings for me.  Were not cutting corners and if a suit takes so long were making less than minimum wage an hour so be it!

Ive had it about four years and its in excellent condition still and very supple.You can get a fair selection off eBay or in actual pet shops but theyll never have the charm or individuality of a custom one. I know a few BDSM sites which do bespoke leather work. DIY Bondage is one and Ive had quite a lot kit made by them over the years. Its not as gucci as something like Collar Factory but its hardwearing and really goddamn cheap for what youre getting. And theyll make anything for you that you can describe to them out of any material.

1624081,0,t1_cjjsp8y,I definitely agree. I had a couple friends who were like this and time and again I had to talk them out of doing some stupid shit. The important thing is to recognize a few key signs about depressionsuicide in others.Its relevant to me because a fur helped me through serious problems like these when my struggles with sexuality and religion came to a head in college. I came through a much better person afterwards and I am live a much more fun and fulfilling life. The difference is whether they actually get help and work on their problems. It takes real effort to fight depression and suicidal urges you have to research it change your environment create goals . Recognize real triggers not BS SJW ones learn to stop yourself before letting it crush you. If applicable this can mean medication as well. Lastly like they say in Alcoholics Anonymous you have a condition it doesnt just disappear. Be wary and you can control that problem. Its been about  years since my last incident and I havent had to seriously tax a friend with these problems since. So I guess my point is that depression can be beaten but you cant force someone to want to beat it.,furry,cjjvq40,4,t5_2qi2h

Some general caution due to the general publics view on it may be a good idea when letting it out to someone else may be a good idea depending on what you think.On the side of your opinions on Yiff i see nothing wrong with it.

2696870,0,t1_cna4qqn,Yes but you can pretend as much as you want but furries are a fetish community. This feels like someone in a rubber pup suit demanding its not a fetish. I dont want this to be family friendly I despise the fact underage kids go to cons. Just because like  of the community wants it to be a family friendly community doesnt mean its going to happen. In fact it harms to community as a whole. Because someone hears about it looks it up and finds an infinite amount of furry porn. Just embrace it like the BDSM community does. With them not everyone wants to be a hardcore slave others are there for the environment and people but it is still a fetish community. Like yes I do love the clean are and part of the community but its a small sample size there is just no way we will ever be taken as a nonsexual group unless people stop drawing the porn and start taking it down but that wont happen because thats what most people like. ,furry,cnallpd,1,t5_2qi2h

2729618,0,t1_cneayvn,Any geek fandom like ours is going to be rife with perverts and weirdos and just plain crazy or poorly adjusted individuals. It doesnt really bother me although I will grant that sometimes it would be nice if I could just casually identify as a furry without worrying about being ridiculed or getting the cold shoulder. In any case despite our abysmal reputation there are still plenty of furries who are amazing wonderful generous people who I hope to keep close for the rest of my life. By the way I can understand your rather bleak view but I dont really appreciate you lumping in everybody who likes furry porn as perverts and freaks. People who are attracted to peculiar things cant exactly help it after all. Beauty is to the eye of the beholder and societys ideals of beauty are constantly changing. Its how you act on those attractions that makes you as a person. Its why I have no problem with pedophiles but I loathe child molesters for instance. If some dude gets off to cubs piss shit or anything else that is gross or taboo and they let off steam by making art of it rather than repressing their urges until they manifest in a negative way then what on earth is the problem? More power to them if you ask me.,furry,cnecgt5,10,t5_2qi2h
2730171,0,t3_2rbty1,. I got into it due to having a dad who identifies as a Pagan. He isnt into it much nowadays but he was when I was younger. Had a lasting impact on me.. I practice alone I have another friend who is Wiccan and sometimes we meditate together. Its fun.. My friend and two others who I dont spend time with but enjoy the company of. My beliefs when it comes to Wicca are quite eclectic... Infact some wouldnt consider me to be Wiccan at all. I incorporate elements of other religions and philosophies such as Zen Buddhism Shinto and Hinduism. I dont worship gods because I feel no need to. I instead worship life force otherwise known as Prana. I feel as if every being atom and object in the universe has Prana  therefore everything is alive and everything is holy and beautiful regardless of how destructive or terrible. I practice rituals in order to alter my state of consciousness therefore bringing my end goal for things like movitation luck wealth love self acceptance into reality itself  or at least using ritual to put suggestions into my subconscious mind.. I dont really feel the need to share rituals but I do recommend meditation rhythmic breathing shamanic drumming chanting and dance. Theyre all very useful tools which can assist you in achieving the right state of mind to practice and feel the flow of magik or prana as I call it through you.. Make an athame of whatever draws or speaks to you. Be it quarts obsidian or even wood.. Its ok not my thing though. Im more of a fan of industrial and ambient music. ,furry,cneeqa7,2,t5_2qi2h

Fast forward a year to someone showing me the encyclopedia dramatica entry for Sonic the Hedgehog. I was already a horny teenager with no drive to find porn outside deviantart that didnt do me any favors.As my drive cooled off near the end of high school I started meeting local furries and discovering what most people were initially exposed to and fell in love with the tame social aspect of the fandom.Ive spent the last few years getting to know some really awesome people and helping with local events such as BLFC.Its a little embarrassing to admit my initial exposure was an outlet for my pent up teenage years but also awesome to realize that I could find people in the fandom that were growing up with me or had already done so.Ive gotten immense amounts of support of every kind from friends I met through the fandom.

I myself thought of furs as horrible sex crazed psychos same sense as the original post. Then developed an interest after developing an interest in Tails from Sonic the hedgehog and it turned out my friend was already one I then found out that you guys arent all sex crazed so they were the final push I needed to accept I was a furry.

3145514,0,t3_2w3wk9,Nah not weird.  Even outside furry circles its not uncommon to find things attractive in art that one isnt really down for in reality.  Im not really sure why that is maybe its because were already accustomed to treating cartoons as an exaggerated abstraction so our minds are more willing to just go with it even if the specific content isnt something that appeals in the flesh.  Maybe for some that makes it a safe way to experiment with taboo or personally challenging foci of attraction.  Whatever the reason I think its totes legitimate and you dont have to feel selfconscious about it at all.  Like the Wiccans say An ye harm none get your freak on.

3149500,0,t1_coodeih,I use acrylic yarn the Red Heart brand just cause its super cheap and Im not really going to be feeling it... Wouldnt use it in like a hat cause its a bit itchy but here I think its fine. Also with that I can get the colors I want without worrying. I use the magic loop for the tail itself so I start at the hook and work to the tip of the tail. For a hook I just to a standard  stitches for a little tab and make a hole for a button. The body of the tail is once I finish the tab I add a few stiches on the end maybe like  or  or something then just keep doubling the stitches until its the right diameter that I like then connect the ends and form the magic loop then I just keep going in circles making it longer. My issue is Narrowing stuffing and the tip. For narrowing I cant quite seem to get the sizing right like the shape of a tail. Ive looked at all kinds of pictures but cant quite seem to get it right without it looking derp. Like Ive made a purpleblack striped tail and a lightbluegreenpurple striped tail. For the purpleblk tail I made it too wide and then when I went to finish the tip it came out flat so it looked like a tube that just cut off with a boob at the end. For my other tail I tried to narrow it earlier and the narrowing just turned into one slant in the side of the tail so it looked like someone took a rectangle cropped off about  of it in the corner and is super wonky.For the stuffing I used just some stuffedanimal fluff but turned out really lumpy in some areas and squish in others.  |    | what happened.And for the tip It mostly came down to either a a boob or  a pencil tip. Ive only done this twice and they take a while to finish but i think the timing is just cause I worked on two or three other projects at the same time so I maybe put an hour or less in it a night. ,furry,coofxtl,1,t5_2qi2h

They made and still make some pretty neat stuff andlike any hormonedriven tweenage furryI wanted one. After college I was making a good bit of money but still living with my parents while I saved up to move out. Explaining why I had a rubber animal penis was not something I wanted to have to deal with so I went through a bunch of crazy steps to keep this sex toy a secret from them going so far as renting a P.O. box buying a lockable storage container and a number of other things that in hindsight were probably overkill.Typically whenever Id use this thing it was in the shower.  My privacy was assured and it made cleanup super easy.Fast forward a few months. My brothers girlfriend had gotten a puppy recently and needed someone to watch it for a few days while she and my brother went on a little weekend vacation. My mother agreed to keep it at our house.After taking a particularly invigorating shower I wrapped up my toy in my towel and set it on my bed as I was getting dressed.  The puppy was in my room at the time and began to sniff at it but I shooed him away he went bolting into the living room. I picked up the toy still wrapped in the towel and set it down beside my desk in an effort to prevent the little guy from trying to get it again. If he tried again Id surely notice.I was wrong.About  minutes later my parents get home. I was on my computer goofing off on IRC or something and didnt really pay any mind to it other than shouting out a hello. About a minute later though I hear my mother cough.I turned around and saw her there holding the toy upsidedown between her thumb and index finger with this really confused look on her face.Is this yours?I couldnt hold it together.  I busted out laughing. Yeah its mine. Just throw it on the bed. She did just that and walked out of my room. Apparently the puppy had managed to sneak back into the room and wiggle it out from inside of the towel. The entire length of the thing was covered in tiny teeth marks.To this day shes never said a word about it.,furry,cpee77a,9,t5_2qi2h

3417890,0,t1_cphun7t,I dont know if I ever really have had a fursona in so much. A character I used as my identity at that time yes but a fursona I think entails more. That being said if you want to take fursona to mean A character who is me but in the Furry fandom then my first And only character that would fit that definition would be Little Blue Bear.Little Blue Bear however has only recently really came out from Furry MUCK and the reasons behind that have been twofold . I always have come up with interesting characters and just pick one of those for a few years and . Because he is an  year old cub Who has the mind of a  year old there are some backstories about that but I disregard all of them I always feared gaining the label Cub fur. However one day I was talking to a young Furry I became friends with and he said to me You know how you always tell me to fuck them? Well take your own advice. I did and now LBB is my fursona.,furry,cphv431,1,t5_2qi2h

I had chosen uCatAndFoxs Strawberry Tiger Snow because of how adorable he was.After completing that drawing which was Snow doing a heart with his big cute paws I offered myself to do something else and well this drawing came to life I feel deeply proud of this one. Its officially my most detailed drawing to date and the one with the most color Ive done. I mean you really really dont know how accurate this image is in a few aspects. The only problem I overlooked was the perspective of the beds head table I dont remember the actual name for it which looks too narrow for the bed and a bit too tall.

It really does help if for nothing else than to be able to ask for critique from someone knowledgeable. You might have a decent amount of raw talent but you do have to focus it to make it count.Aside from all the tips on how to draw in this thread the one most important factor to cultivate for yourself is the motivation to keep doing it. Its a struggle sometimes. What got me going was to one day out of the blue commit to drawing something every day. No breaks. You take even as little as  minutes to put something on paper and youve met your quota. See how long you can keep up daily practice and then even after a few months you can look back on what else you made and see improvements you can take in for the next sketch.There will be some days where you look at other peoples really fantastic art and think maybe even start believing that you couldnt accomplish anything with the same amount of skill or imagination or depth. And that wont really stop anytime soon either. If it does I personally havent experienced it yet. You need to accept that judging yourself too harshly against other artists wont help you if it only leads to more frustration. What you should do instead is well what youre doing now learn from other peoples advice and work. Keep doing that and then find your own style that other people might envy later.But yeah you will experience ruts of hating your own work so youll need to develop ways of getting out of them. Like just take your fursona out for a spin and draw a bunch of goofy nonsensical faces that look dumb anyway. Or vent by drawing your character to be as frustrated as you are. Or simplify your style until you feel better. Alternatively just watch this videoSo if you want any other advice just ask it. Seems like youve got a lot on your plate here as it is but it all looks helpful. Keep going forward and dont forget to ask for critique once in awhile.,furry,cqtk406,1,t5_2qi2h

With socializing and conversation and relaxation and games. And not endless streams of alcohol and drugs and people acting like total idiots towards each other.I refuse to support such things in any form whatsoever.

4081041,0,t1_crlfrfn,Unfortunately not knowing any better isnt limited to just young kids. Theres been plenty of cases where people in their late teens or early s just simply havent given a shit and done it anyway. Why? Because they dont care about the artists who make the work or having something they madedesigned themselves.  Im actually slightly paranoid people will use my characters and sully their image as narcissistic as that sounds which is precisely what the negative effect listed for the art commissioner is. Misrepresenting characters may seem like a relatively small thing to some but it can totally ruin the integrity of a character or story. Theres a few pictures that I can think of that are used often and now every time I see them all I can think of is the people who use them rather than the character as intended. And needless to say my opinion of those people rarely raise above neutral which is pretty damaging to the characters and art involved.ampnbspSorry for the ranting and rambling.

A Skinwalker is like a RAKE but hides in its victims skin. It usally attacks campers in the US and Canada by mimicking a human in need of help. Once it has lured one camper away it brutaly rips them apart and takes there skin. A Wendigo is believed to have been human at one time but now its bits and pieces of whatever rotting carcass it finds. It wants to eat you...very very slowly. A RAKE is the Skinwalkers big bad brother. It wont steal your skin and might not even kill you. It will however mentally torture you until you bring it more victims or until you kill your entire family or worse. A dire badger is like Bigfoot on bathsalts. They are rare so thats good.

4145169,0,t1_crsrkxe,ampampamp Therapsida sfw gtTherapsida is a group of synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors.   Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids including having their four limbs extend vertically beneath the body as opposed to the sprawling posture of other reptiles The earliest fossil attributed to Therapsida is Tetraceratops insignis from the Lower Permian   Therapsids evolved from pelycosaurs specifically sphenacodonts  million years ago. They replaced the pelycosaurs as the dominant large land animals in the Middle Permian and were replaced in turn by the archosauromorphs in the Triassic although one group of therapsids the kannemeyeriiforms remained diverse in the Late Triassic The therapsids included the cynodonts the group that gave rise to mammals in the Late Triassic around  million years ago. Of the nonmammalian therapsids only cynodonts and dicynodonts survived the TriassicJurassic extinction event The last of the nonmammalian therapsids the tritylodontid cynodonts became extinct in the Early Cretaceous approximately  million years ago.gtgtImage iInteresting Sphenacodontoidea | Crapartinella | Kitchinganomodon | Vinceria Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcrsrlu oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecrsrlu.

4151011,0,t1_crsnync,We start by asking questions.   What would you do if you saw someone without a badge?The bad  Anything regarding touching manhandling harassing or calling supervisors or for backup.  This implies that they think they need to be more hands on  Especially if theyre thinking they need backup!    The answer to this question isnt usually a deal breaker either.  I will typically use a bad answer to this as a opportunity to tell them more about what we expect so they do better in following answers.   Ill say Well just so you know wed rather  people get in for free than for us to have one fur spend the rest of their con feeling pushed around by security nazis    The good  Any answer that talks about asking politely to see their badge or reminding people that they need to wear their badge    The more they talk about being nice  reminding or being polite the better.Excellent The one answer that sticks in my mind the person was saying Id politely inform them that this area of the hotel has been rented out by a convention and tell them how to get to registration. and to follow up he had something about Just because they look like a fur doesnt mean they know anything about how the con works and that they need a badge.     I was so happy with that answer! What would you do if you saw someone wearing inappropriate clothing?   The answers to this question basically are the same as the above question but this will sometimes give you a idea of how close to the letter of the law a person has a tendency to be.  In this one requesting backup in extreme situations is a perfectly acceptable answer. What would you do if you saw someone stumbling around drunk?    This question is actually a loaded question.   Answers to this one NEED to include talking about HELPING and not treating them like theyve done wrong. The last part of this is that i usually let our staff know that all of the signs of appearing drunk are representations of someone whos having a hypoglycemic attack. Convention staff are NEVER qualified to assume someone is drunk. We can ask them if theyre okay ask them if the need medication and help them back to their room. Even better if they have friends that can be with them in their room.  If theyre so gone that theyre unintelligible then we have little choice but to push it up the chain of command.  Which can vary wildly between cons anything such as calling paramedics hotel security the con security lead con medic or just another staffer for judgement.  What would you do if you saw someone with a knife?This one is another loaded or trick question.  It really tells me a lot about how the person thinks. Are they inclined to think the worst or not?   Are they going to escalate situations or not.   The BEST answer to this question is .. What kind of knife?    Remembering that were a costume and creative convention so its pretty common to see prop knives exacto knives utility tools and such.  These are not illegal and so a attendee should not expect to get roughed up because they have a innocuous knife even if it is against the con rules.  The best place to start is to politely inform.    Good answers should include determining if theres danger assessing if theres people uncomfortable and calling for help from whatever source is needed. The worst answers include tackling people or any kind of thing that would put ANYONE in danger if the situation were as serious as they can be imagining it to be.   Next StepThe last thing ill do is invite them to work the ops or gophers station. This will let me ultimately determine if they feel like other work is below them .. if they think that way then theyre not a lot of good to me.   Not everything is glamorous. ,furry,crtfgnh,4,t5_2qi2h

4185412,0,t1_crxbq1u,Strangely I think artists have it a bit easier but may also get typecast more as someone who draws porn.  Sure theres a gap between artistic nudity and actual porn but that particular stigma hovers over both.  With sexual content being largely a visual thing for people I think looking at NSFW images is much more widely accepted than even well written erotica.  Part of that may also be the ease with which you can filter or skip over art you dont like or you think is junk whereas prose requires some investment to read and find out how good or bad it is!I think that for myself personally the only way Im going against the current is that I focus on writing a good story first and including adult content second.  Even if the concept is write erotica with a sex scene per chapter Ill somehow find a way to make it as natural and believable as possible advance the story and build the relationship between the characters.  I suppose in a way sometimes I feel like people may not be interested in reading because itll be too much story and not enough sex ha!

Tais already heard this on FA but Ill say it anyways.WARNING WARNING MASSIVE RANT INCOMINGThis is probably my favourite piece of furry art ever.I was in a similar place not too long ago. I was in the depths of depression. Fortunately I didnt fall into the bottomless pit that is selfharm but that doesnt mean that I cant relate.The same feeling is there. Look in his face his eyes. Not only sadness but emotional emptyness. Hopelessness. Look at his posture. He looks relaxed. Unmoving. Unphased. Not angry not crying. Just... sad. Nothing but sad. No room for other emotions.This piece really resonates with me on a very personal level. It reminds me of where I was. It expresses what I felt almost perfectly even though I wasnt cutting myself. It makes me wonder how close I was to doing that.And if anybody is going through this  depression selfharm or anything like that  right now look at the picture again. But this time look past the blood. Past the sadness. Just the character.And you know what?This yellow husky is a really beautiful guy. Hes just going through a tough time. Depression or selfharm doesnt make you any lesser of a person. If anything it makes you stronger once you push through it. Youre still an awesome person deep down inside.,furry,cryupuj,14,t5_2qi2h

That was one of the very few games that made a real impression on me  Ill admit I dont even remember the storyline but I loved the graphics.I admittedly have no idea where to start though. It lines up nicely that I find D games so disorientating since D is basically all math and... yeah math and me dont get along at all so making something D would be a nightmare.

Despite the fact that people tout it as a reddit alternative the only groups on reddit that really advertise voat are fringe ideologues who dont like that the average person doesnt like hearing what they have to say and have become overly sensitive to criticism. Its basically become a haven for the conspiracy theorists the fph group red pill followers etc etc... so its really not surprising you havent heard of it haha.

4406929,0,t3_3bhld6,Not a real price or real listing. If you actually paid to order that they would cancel your order. There are seller accounts that use computer algorithms to generate sale listing across millions of titles. Amazon has last I checked  million titles that they rank and I think that means uncounted millions more they dont because they have never sold. These sellers use these listings for price manipulation with very low expectation to ever sell anything. However in  million listings if they sell  and they can source  of them by buying from someone else at a lower price they have made money just for a little time operating the bot that generates the listings. When they make a sale before they buy the product its called arbitrage. These sellers have high rates of cancellation and displeased customers and Id say should always be avoided. They are easy to recognize if you look at old books a lot. They likely do make a few successes among buyers who arent that diligent about seeking out items that are obscure and not easy to find.  There is no end to those because  of books ever made are out of print. I checked closer and there is actually a real copy or two for sale there. They may be pricing off the robo lister and should price way down because they may sit on it til kingdom come.There are rumors that these prices are also used for money laundering but I have never seen evidence of that happening. However there have been some pretty big cases of toolow prices indicating crime.  Some are theft operations from libraries. A big case that ended in court this year was an entire ring of bribery to school distribution a guy was paying thousands to employees to steal textbooks and sell them underpriced to move them fast. The notable part was how many people took bribes and he managed to even sell some of them back to schools he stole them from.Fun fact the dude who ran the Silk Road drug website started as manager of an Amazon book operation but that was legit.,furry,csme8t1,1,t5_2qi2h

Red turned his radio down and ordered a steak extra rare. Taking a sip from his glass he suddenly felt a gentle tug on his trousers. Looking down he saw a human child sniffling eyes red and puffy from a recent bout of intense crying.Hey there little one! What can I do to help you?The child sniffled again as she wiped her nose on a sleeve again. I wanna go home. Im lost and wanted to find Mommy in the city where she worked.Red smiled warmly being careful to not show too many teeth. Of course!

Mommy let me do the ticket machine before and I remembered how to work it! The girl smiled proudly holding up her swipe card for the subway. The feline got up then downed his steak in two bites.

He glances at the boxreadbribe that he is to present to the king.  Looking back at the shackles he asks in a submissive tone What do you need from me?During the process of donning the shackles Dusk makes every effort that his lantern is always on hand and is able to be lit at a moments notice.  In the event that they attempt to take the lantern insist on keeping it.  Going as far as calling into question the reliability of their lighthouse system.OOC Good to know and I do like this version of events better.

4547836,0,t3_3dch85,Its funny that Ive always felt this way and when I speak to people of success I always tend to posit that I would rather feel successful and content with what Im doing that chasing monetary gain as a measure of success.Very few people will accept this mindset though...  To the point where most people I encounter directly belittle me or attempt to insult me for not believing in the idea that money  success.  Ive even had people become irate over the fact that I refuse to accept the idea that ones earning potential is the sole measure of how successful you are in life. or more of people I meet tend to be chasing monetary gain at the cost of their own state of mind.  Pushing themselves to do meaningless work In expectation of some monetary reward yet never having time to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  Most of them are angered if youre not doing exactly the same as them it seems.I wish it was easier for more people to realize that money isnt just everything I feel like there would be so much less hate in this world in general if people werent constantly chasing empty promises of fulfillment through monetary gain and dealing with the feeling of emptiness and depression that pursuit creates then taking it out on everyone around them...

I know a lot of people but in reality only four others are best friends. My small group which I hang out with during summer. And I dont even try to be cool. Its not cool to be cool. Really if you are yourself and others like you for that then they are true friends.So basically be yourself and the rest will follow.,furry,cuboax4,1,t5_2qi2h

With only a few chinks in his otherwise impenetrable armor Aiden can easily fend off any attack be that from another Kaiju or some sort of furryhuman military force. Stamina .

We dont want to have a tuckeredout Kaiju lying in the middle of all the wreckage he just caused now do we? Mental . The poor dumb bastard. His motives are as follows EAT CRUSH KILL SLEEP. In that exact order. Any thinking is on a very low intelligence tier.Technique . Adapting to all that mass means that not only can your enemies not use that to their advantage but you could use it to your own.

5178182,0,t3_3lxl7w,To expand a little on uMonoDragons comment  There are only two generally agreed on requirements to be a Furry. And believe it or not you dont have to be one to hang out with us. If people dont judge us we have no problems with them hanging around and chatting. An interest in Anthropomorphic Animals. This means animals that have been given noteworthy human traits. This can be the ability to speak human intelligence or more often human anatomy which is often what you will see in furry art work. This could be an interest in them in any way whether it be in art literature or anything else. Call yourself a Furry. Because of how broad the first criteria is this one kinda has to exist or an obscene amount of people would technically be furries. If you want to call yourself one? Congrats you are one of us. Thats all there really is to it ,furry,cva5smt,16,t5_2qi2h
5179165,0,t1_cva9kwf,I played world of warcraft and my gnome rogues name was Kurfluffin in reference to the family guy episode where Peters dad comes to live with them and Lois tells him to sit his kurfluffin down. During raids people would tell me what to do and instead of saying Kurfluffin they would say Kurf. And when we really got to know each other they started calling me Kurfy.My sonas orginal name was going to be Kika but it didnt sound like me. So I went with the name I was known by for years.

5191608,0,t3_3m3roj,What defines a furry A fan of animals with human traits. Yes this is incredibly broad we are a broad group.Do all furries like the porn Nope. Youll find people who are in no way in it for the porn only in it for the porn and everything inbetween personally I have no interest in it.Character questions Everything regarding your own character is completely optionalmatters of personal taste. Nobody will think you to be less of a furry if you dont have a costume or drawings of your character or you made it a mix of animals X Y and Z and potentially even ABCD etc.. You dont even need a character if you dont want to make one its all up to you.Hope this answers your questions.

5558356,0,t3_3r90h6,To be perfectly honest I find the best way to survive this fandom is to get your little circle and just stick with them. Not strictly of course but by doing so Ive bypassed so much drama. The fact is that the furry fandom is a community theres a huge variety of people and it just so happens that furries are really good at selfsegregating and getting into confrontation over really stupid shit pardon my french. I mean of course this is coming from a cynic and a pessimist. And dont get me wrong there are really cool and nice furries that Ive even had the pleasure to meet on and offline. Im just saying from experience its a lot easier to find a crowd and stick with em. If people think youre a douche for not wanting to hug fuck em. Thats childish. And dont let people make you think that you have to be hyper sexual and wanting to bang peoples characters all the time. It comes with a lot of the fandom sure but its not necessary and youre not any worse for not wanting to partake.TLDR The fandom tends to attract drama but theres plenty of cool people wholl like and accept you for who you are. My advice is to stick with them.,furry,cwm2coe,1,t5_2qi2h

People wont notice if they in particular smell like ass since a bunch of other people at the con follow the same level of hygiene as they do Unfortunately this also stacks the nastiness and reach of the stench similar to the stacking effect of time spent wearing the clothes in point .,furry,cx4vb83,2,t5_2qi2h

Laptops were never designed with component upgrades in mind beyond the modular RAM Drivebay and sometimes rarely CPU. everything else is a miniaturized version custom built by the OEM to fit in the package.

5837328,0,t1_cxksmod,gt Or even how long the fandom has been around. Because youre in the wrong decade there. According to fandom historian Fred Patten the concept of furry originated at a science fiction convention in  when a character drawing from Steve Gallaccis Albedo Anthropomorphics started a discussion of anthropomorphic characters in science fiction novels. This led to the formation of a discussion group that met at science fiction conventions and comics conventions.If youre going to try and correct someone make sure youre right about it yourself. In fact the first furrcon happened in . It was confurence.Bronies arent furry. Theyre literally brightly colored fanart of a little girls TV show. Theres no overlapping. There may be people that are into both but that does not make them over lap.Unless youre standing upright youre not anthropomorphic. The broad definition does not fit in the fandom.,furry,cxksu7d,1,t5_2qi2h

5998123,0,t3_3xmb29,Let me show you a nicer videoIts similar to working on a cosplay some people like movies some people like comics some people like anthropomorphic animals. However unlike characters from mainstream media these characters are created by yourself. There is a nice thing about creating your own character and build it from scratch until you have a physical representation of himher. For some including myself its a hobby. I enjoy making the costumes and wearing them it is a lot of fun to act in character and interact with people. Its pretty rewarding when you see stuff like photos or videos that showing this character you came up fully fleshed out.,furry,cy5vuz6,1,t5_2qi2h

No fursona fursuit art or anything else is needed to be considered a furry. The word furry is simply a label. Similar to metalhead or TV junkie. So we exist in society as your average everyday people.Many furries have fursonas a representation of oneself as an anthropomorphic animal that they like to create art of or role play with. Many also like to draw write fiction perform music and talk about movies TV shows and video games.People are in the fandom for different reasons but most are in just cuz they like the art style. Like me for example. I joined the fandom simply because I havent outgrown cartoon animals yet and probably never will.  ,furry,cymkqbn,9,t5_2qi2h

Something similar happened to me only in my case it was just some random internet browsing. I was looking for some pictures came across furries got involved in the fandom and through the course of a few years I was doing extensive research and decided to call myself a furry. Thats basically the very short version of how I became a furry. Well before that I did love anthros in everything from stories to cartoons and games so yeah I guess it was kind of inevitable for me.Im glad you found something you like and decided to call yourself a furry. Dont worry about your friends or other people knowing about it if the topic comes to it let them know if not they dont have to know. Its all up to you in the end though so thats just a suggestion. Its pretty much how I go about it.Well anyway hope you enjoy your stay in the fandom. Have fun and I hope you have a great day!,furry,cz1gop2,3,t5_2qi2h

6321150,0,t3_424e6l,I have a problem of not being straight and not being gay either. I think the only way I could ever meet someone if I moved to another country since Im from the baltic and there arent many furs here preferably somewhere that speaks EnglishSince its my second language  where no one knows me and where there are other furs I could meet which is sadly very unlikely unless I get some job in the USUKCanadaAUS etc which would allow me to move there with not anything over  I am trying to be a programmerdeveloper though so I might be able to get a job like that in the future. I also really want to go to some convention like Anthrocon if I could get a temporary job in the US it would be perfect! Unless I have to work on those days But moving would be pretty hard for me as well since I have  connections or friends anywhere other than my own country and its pretty hard to leave your regular life behind you with no clue what couldwill happen when I move to an unknown place hell Ive never even gone any other countries than Latvia Finland and Sweden nor have I ever traveled via a plane. Any tips here would help as well.I am pretty picky as well since a lot of furs arent in the best shape To my knowledge maybe Im brainwashed by stereotypes Im somewhat fitokay looking I suppose myself. If you are wondering what the hell even floats my boat then well mostly yiff preference is male but I would say I am bi in that regard. Although I cant lie kurfy fursuit videos are interesting as well.I wonder if someone has the same types of problemsexperience with problems like these.On a happy sidenote Im still young not even  yet so I still have  a lot of time to find someone!,furry,cz858nl,2,t5_2qi2h

Hes not so terrible that he cant sleep he just cant get sleep like how society wants him to. Getting up at  every morning is torture as him falling asleep before midnight is unheard of. And all before  is rare as well. For a more practical answer to the question how he covers his eyes with the way too short blanket and thus gives in to cold feet. He lies all stretched out on his stomach with one arm under the pillow.

6639017,0,t3_46kz4y,gt Do you wear something unusual?Not really. I like not to draw attention to myself when Im in public.gt Favourite school subject?Id say my art classes were pretty bearable. I was bullied a lot in school and my art teacher used to let me sit in another empty class room so I could draw what I wanted to. Half of the time I used to just go to sleep during those classes so I didnt really do any actual learning with the time.gt Do you like cartoons?TV? In general no. Comics? Kinda depends on what its about. Art? The art style decides it for me.gt What you think about Yiff side of Furry?Ive been drawing it for quite a while now and I do find it interesting at times too but it depends on so many different factors like how its drawnanimated or what the contents of the imagesvideostories are. Needless to say there are certain subject matters that I refuse to touch even with someone elses  foot barge pole..Ive also found that some people in this fandom do take it upon themselves to force that sexual interest into peoples faces with sexual images in their profile pictures random unprovoked sexual comments on sites like Twitter Tony the Tiger fiasco anyone? or the ways some people behave at Furmeets and conventions. Unfortunately though theres nothing that we can possibly do to completely stop that sort of thing from happening.The sexual side of the fandom is there and people that dont understand the fandom will always focus on that because its the weirdest part of the entire fandom. At the end of the day people will always focus on negatives rather than positives. gt Have you ever hurt someone feelings?Everybody has at some point or another hurt someone elses feelings. At this point Ive stopped walking on egg shells and trying to be incredibly inoffensive. I just be myself. I dont actively try to upset people and if they find something to be upset about then thats their problem.gt Your sona is captain of biggest and most famous spaceship.

I didnt keep him in my mind for long though being a kid with other things on my mind.gt Has it gone through any design changes over time?His initial design was a feral lion and he was inexplicably blue for some reason. When I went around to redesign him I ditched the weird blue colour scheme for something more normal and made him anthro instead. His name also changed but I dont remember the original name any more just that it was different to what it is now.gt What does it represent to you?When redesigning my sona to be how he is now I aimed to make him as accurate to the real me as possible even going so far as to take photos of myself to use as reference for how Id design his body type. The only difference between me and my sona is the fact hes well a lion. Other than that hes just me. No epic backstory just me.,furry,d06ibxx,2,t5_2qi2h

Theyre gonna list off their favorite franchises they love to draw and contribute to your with art and etc. Theres no real big company in regards to furry and thats the thing. The closest off hand is probably Pokemon and at that point we could dive into semantics on the crossover from furry fan and Pokemon fan.  You ask someone whos a furry and theyll probably go I got into it because Zootopia but now I watch this dude on Picarto draw.  Compare that to someone whos into Scifi and the average fan will probably go Yeah I saw Star Wars and then got into Battlestar Galactica or The Expanse. Maybe theyll seek more independent artists and thats awesome but from my experience where I was talking from its not for your average fan course. ,furry,d0ci72u,1,t5_2qi2h

6716275,0,t3_47ma7c,that con in particular? cant tell right now because their website is down.HOWEVER I can give you a rough guess as to costs.You will need to register for a badge. This will probably come to you in a few different packages. For your first con the basic registration will serve you fine. Anywhere from  bucks for a weekend badge  for a day badge. If you are under  you will need a guardian with you as well.youll want to have a bit of money set aside to donate to a charity or to buy some artwork or prints or something at the Dealers Den or Artist Alley. There are all sorts of amazingly cool things there price ranges from  bucks to hundreds. I recommend for your first con to visit the dealers den or artist alley or both  and gather their business cards and watch them on their FA DA or wherevery they post things. You may want to commission a reference sheet before the con and have a couple prints of it with you if you intend to get art of your character done at the con. I presume that you mentioned Furpocalypse because its local so I wont mention hotel room split which is probably around  a night if split with  people.I budget cons with  people at  bucks for travel badge charity donations purchases hotel share and food. If you assume a similar budget youd probably still walk home with  bucks left over. HOWEVER bigger cons mean higher badge prices Even though its still  bucks for basic at AC. ,furry,d0e0rl3,2,t5_2qi2h

For now you might want to try to hone your drawing skills and draw up a couple of ref sheets just so youre prepared in case you do find what you want.

Anthro is love i say Anthro is life. My dad hears me and says Your too old to be watching that!. I knew he was just jealous of my lucario plushie. I call him an ignorant asshole he slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. Im crying now. And my face hurts. I lay in bed its really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touching me. Its Uncle Kage. I am so happy. He whispers in my ear. This is my life. He grabs me with his powerful fur hands and puts me on my hands and knees. I am ready. I give the rest of my sanity to uncle kage. He penetrates it with his claws. It hurts so much but i do it for uncle kage. I can feel my soul tearing as uncle kage  converts me into a Furry. I push against his force i want to please uncle kage. He roars a mighty roar as he empties my soul. My dad walks in. Uncle kage looks him straight into his eyes and says.....Hes a furfag now. Uncle kage leaves through the window. Furry is love Furry is life. On a serious note Basically i watched a furry video and its grown on me ever since. Its amazing what a single video on the internet can do. ,furry,d0p1zzx,4,t5_2qi2h

6831135,0,t3_499lla,Hugging other furs used to be a lot more open in the fandom back in the day think s ugh showing my age and got more politically correct when the whole hug gate  cosplay is not consent bit started taking shape in recent years. A lot of that stemmed from outside of furry animescifi where it is a more serious of a problem in my opinion. I think a lot of that has to do with how disconnected the fandom is generally speaking at least. Furs keep in touch over the Internet meet up from everywhere at cons after being so disconnected in real life and then its almost natural at that point to WANT to give your friends a hug whom you havent seen in forever. Literally theres some friends I may go years without seeing in real life and when I see them you better believe I want to make them feel lovedwelcomedcherished. That kind of behavior becomes more integrated into your personality over time. Its addictive.Fursuits are typically big and fluffy but its always best to ask since fursuits usually come with a pricetag of  for the good ones at least. Asking at that point is essentially just being respectful of other peoples property. That being said as long as you arent creepin most fursuiters will be happy to hug someone and I can speak first hand that I love to giveget hugs in fursuits. Literally some of the best feels in your life right there. Fursuit hugs can be a mixed bag too because sometimes you will have that hardcore suiter who goes nonstop and totally wreaks of BO so just be forewarned that everyones definition of acceptable hygiene kinda varies or the suiter may be oblivious. Vice versa some congoers also are unaware of their own stench. Look dude if Im in suit and you smell zero fucks given I will not hug you and go tell you to take a shower.Anyways for the most part its a great thing. Maybe you are a more reserved person than most? Maybe you just not the touchy feely type? Its completely okay to be that and have others respect that space. Above all you should always feel comfortable with who you are. When you are wanting to take that next step then go for it on your own terms when you are ready to.MirageTwitter miirage,furry,d0qlyin,1,t5_2qi2h

6838048,0,t1_d0rdmd4,While credit is always nice it doesnt mean jack shit if it means that the reuploader gets more exposure because of your work. It also means that my work isnt directly protected under my copyrights on that site and if someone takes it from there then it just gets spread around more possibly without any credit that leads to edits and then people just assume its free game for whatever. Ive had this done to a render I made as well as a few NSFW pieces. This is why I require that people ask if they can repost my art because the answer is almost always no. People dont read descriptions or sidebars most of the time they see the image. It brings more traffic to the reposter more often then not and Im left having to reverse google image search my own art on google because someone saw that repost and then uploaded it to their instagram and then someone saw that and now its on their google page and then someone uploads it to DA under the title Funny google ImageI cannot feed myself with that exposure and commissioners certainly dont like having their paid for art reuploaded by strangers onto some site somewhere.EDIT Reuploading can be especially dangerous for me with NSFW pieces while I can regulate that my adult art is behind a wall so only other adults can see it but if someone decides to upload it somewhere where there isnt  content wall then it could possibly become my problem.,furry,d0re98d,1,t5_2qi2h

The office didnt tell us about the damage and now we can see it. The mold and water damage is spreading. The office obviously didnt take the proper steps to fix the water damage. Plus there are other units in the complex with water damage we are learning about. When I went to the office about the mold they came in while I wasnt home and bleached the ceiling last week. No notice or anything. Now the mold is coming back and worse. I know that bleach cant fix black mold but for some reason the managment seems to think Im dumb enough to think it does.Edit I work at a big fancy like if you can imagine how rich people go to the grocery sip wine while shopping and have luncheons family owned grocery making fancy food for people.

That being said it can be just as exciting and adventurous a time of selfdiscovery and innovation as you already seem to be realising! Its important that you discover something that makes you fulfilled in the long run and if you need to take the time to find out what that something is then do so. That being said be sure that you can sustain yourself financially etc. as you do so before you pursue whatever it is that winds up making you passionate. Additionally try not to isolate yourself from newer people try to get their unique perspectives on things and build bridges. If it comes down to it you might need to rely on some of them to help you figure yourself out and it never hurts to have friends anyway. Thats easier said than done but it could really prove beneficial to you.Sorry that got a bit rambly I hope I understood at least some of what youre getting at if not please do correct me and I hope things work out for you!

7162815,0,t1_d1sac46,gt I still prefer driving all the time here because theres just not enough coverage for mass transit to make it useful enough unless youre lucky with stationbus stop placement. Again San Francisco is kindof the exception since things are packed together more but SJ is a huge sprawl  the only thing that covers many areas is buses which are meh and even if youre lucky enough to be near light rail or BART its still fairly limited.Right but its probably close enough from experience that you can bribe a local or hail Uber to get you tofrom the station to where youre going.gt Ill agree that parking costs and time spent driving are also concerns but Id also note that public transit isnt going to be so free or quick either... but there is the convenience factor of not having to drive yourself. Call it a wash.Well cheaper than driving Amtraks usually around  or  each way very predictably your average sedans going to use at least that much and takes about as long.  But you can nap on the train Im pretty sure CHP frowns on sleeping while driving.gt So I suppose in the end I do take your point and Im perhaps a bit biased against our public transport infrastructure and so used to driving everywhere.This is why I didnt recommend it for transfer trips.  Tulsa Transit runs twice an hour at best and if you miss one you really missed one I know people who use it exclusively when theyre not lucky enough to get offered a ride a big pride factor being they wont ask and we dont have HOV lanes so no slugging culture going on their strategy is to stack up on extra batteries and pray to God they get a bus that has wifi.  I dont recommend taking Tulsa Transit unless its a notransfer trip for you because of that and even then due to the infrequency you really have to plan around that trip though this should change for the better with the passage of Prop  yesterday.,furry,d1scdb6,1,t5_2qi2h

7285343,0,t3_4f3v2r,I had the same problem with coming up with a fursona. I couldnt decide on an animal I liked. I didnt really want to do a fox a cat a bat or an owl or any other bird so I decided to go another route. If you cant narrow it down in the way that Keeshu said of ones you like that are outside of yourself you could try looking at traits you share with certain animals.I took a look at certain things I did the way I am and traits people said I had and took a look at animals that also had those traits. I narrowed it down to an Ox because of my Zodiac sign and believing in it or not I fit it pretty well especially being stubborn. A honey badger because I can have a very bad temper to say the least. And a bear for more reasons I can list. And you can see which ended up becoming my fursona. At the time I didnt like bears too much so I was sort of in denial of the fact Id end up picking that as my fursona at the start of my journey but now theyre my favorite animal. And I ended up picking a North American Black Bear because at the time my fursona was going to just be an avatar for me and theyre more anxious than grizzly bears and I have generalized anxiety disorder and I didnt see any black bear sonas at the time.If you dont want it to be close to you you can just think of what you want in a character and then follow those steps. As for colors you can match them to their personality or make it a contrast so its ironic. Like a character that doesnt like attention having bright colors. Or you can go with the animals natural colors which is what I do. But thats because I prefer the natural colors and showing off neat natural patterns and the sort that I see on photos of real animals. So I cant really give advice on other colors. But there can be creative fun in natural too. So thats my advice. It took me months to finally decide on a bear even though part of it was denial it is another way a lot of furs pick their fursona. ,furry,d26amc1,1,t5_2qi2h

7564815,0,t1_d31i7lw,I thought it was worth the price of admission. Without giving it all away it started out as kind of a general furry documentary going into how a variety of people joined the fandom from gay to straight and to people who use it as a weekend release to lifestylers and what all they do in the fandom. In the last  it kind of went off on a tangent about Uncle Kage and commented on how the fandom can be hypocritical about how accepting they are. I will say that while personally I did not fully agree with the message they were trying to push they did include clips of some of the people they featured disagreeing with their message. So while I wouldnt say this was some fully neutral impartial documentary they didnt whitewash anything and let the people who disagreed disagree.Ultimately it was a very good documentary that was very well made and while it tried to push a message it didnt seem to openly antagonize someone being filmed or the viewer of the film just because they disagreed with what they tried to push. Worth the price of admission in my eyes.Also I personally bought it on vimeo and it was just a normal mp file with no extras.,furry,d322zwg,2,t5_2qi2h

I just thought it was a game about animal people no different than any other fantasy type game I didnt know about furry.An older friend told me about it but it wasnt for a little while that I brought it up again and he started talking about furries and explained them as people who dress up as animals and have sex and want to have sex with animals ironic as he was the one who introduced me. I believed him obviously no reason not to.For years I just sorta ignored furries when people made jokes I laughed I made jokes. I happily subscribed to furry artists on DeviantArt without a second thought. I was furry in denial.Then one day I was watching some youtube and I saw a video somehow about fursuits and I realised that I really wanted one.As Ive said before its kind of hard to deny being a furry when you want a fursuit!

I know it can be difficult working such long hours but I commend you for putting such effort forth to further yourself. I can understand why you would be a bit distressed about this though. But while eighty hours may not be a lot of time for romantic endeavors there is still time for other things. Perhaps you can grow more comfortable with living alone in the mean time and do some searching within yourself. I know we already talked about this but getting used to your own company is not a bad thing at all! In fact I would argue that being self sustaining while alone is a quality of being a great candidate for a relationship. Thats not to say you should avoid people though. Making friends is a great way to get through any troubles you may be facing and if you find a relationship in the meantime then all the better! I appologize if what I said sounds rambly but I suppose what Im saying is that perhaps you can see this as a time for self reflection. Good luck with everything man and if you ever need somebody to talk to Ill always be up to listen.,furry,d3ntk5x,1,t5_2qi2h

With the catch being that genders poses colours clothes body types not sure about facial expressions cant change. Not sure if this or another one of the same artist but he had one where he locked the specie down to only caninefeline as well.So basically he drew a whole pic and then a bunch of people dropped heavy cash just so he slaps the minuscule details on top of it.

7886010,0,t3_4naz27,Hey welcome. Random scenario for you an international organisation is starting to colonise planets but the humans of today arent quite good at surviving in the wild. Around the same time some mad scientist discovers a way to turn people into anthros by altering a process normally used to cure some diseases.The organisation picks up the research and uses it to create colonists that are better at surviving in the wild. People that volunteer to colonise a new planet have to go through the process but they get to choose which species of anthro theyd want to be. Its irreversible.The question is would you accept to turn into an anthro forever and colonise a new planet with  other people? If you manage to survive  years other people will join the colony and youll be able to go back to earth on that ship. ,furry,d42gl24,2,t5_2qi2h

Find some styles or pictures you like and figure out why you like them. Take the things you like and combine them. Its okay to take little things from people so long as you dont copy every thing over. Id say thats how most of the fandom starts.Once you have a written description you could try to get a commission or free request keep looking around the subreddit there are plenty of artists who draw for free.If you are really intent on drawing your character you could head over to rfurryartschool for help.

If anyone has a problem with you the best thing to do is try to ignore it. I have had my fair share of jerks in life and i know how it may feel. Just know is that there is nothing to me ashamed about here! What i say is that as long as you are not hurting anyone i support you. Its just too bad the whole world doesnt seem to think like that. If you are ever feeling depressed because of what someone may be thinking about you. Find someone like me to talk to! Yes people may call you out and call you weird and different.

You cannot control that you have high functioning autism. While you can control how you cope with it all that matters is that you try your best. Beyond that people just bloom in different stages of their lives.  years old is still very young. You have plenty of time to make things how you want them to be! Do not let the darkness of yesterday cloud your perceptions of tomorrow. You said your depression has slowly gotten better and that is wonderful. It can continue to do so! Sometimes it may be slow but you should not let those slow times discourage you. If I may ask have you seen a doctor or therapist about your autism and depression? Visiting one can really help with both.And hey Im sorry if I was a bit cluttered in my response but if you take anything away from it please take this.You are not a failure and you are not a dork. Your value as a person is not determined on how much money you make. You are great and you are trying your best and I appreciate that you are here. Good luck with everything dude.

8285152,0,t3_4sy9wb,gtHe was born without hearinggtHe never speaks to anyoneDeaf people dont usually talk to begin with since talking requires you to be able to hear and understand what youre saying. Especially more so when he is born deaf. He wouldnt even know what talking sounds like since he has never experienced the sense of hearing so it would be difficult for him to read lips as well as he would need to have a basic understanding of what sounds particular lip movements make in order to accurately interpret them. He wouldnt speak at all really just make random noises which even he himself can neither hear nor understand. So yeah saying that he doesnt speak when we already know that he was born deaf is an unnecessary detail as its quite obvious. ,furry,d5d7b5x,1,t5_2qi2h

Partially because I already saw it in preview clips for Zootopia and because it goes on a little long. Nick Wildes smirk is awesome but thats not enough to stop the cringe I have from watching that particular scene. Then if youve watched a lot of Disney stuff youll see some setups that are similar to certain scenes in previous Disney movies. For better or worse depending on if it annoys you or not. Also if you look too deep into the story itll seem a rather cheesy too. However I dont give a darn about what the story is usually anymore it depends more on how it is done.Id recommend watching it.

8468922,0,t3_4vnz6n,Im really discouraged by the comments on imgur. A ton of people confused why she has image issues while at the same time lavishing about her beauty. Sometimes having issues about how you look has nothing to do with whether you think you look nice or not but it has to do with the simple fact of people staring at you and making their own judgments to begin with.Imagine if a much larger person made an album like this? The trolls would be flooding with yup makes sense comments.I can totally relate. I didnt learn about furry until late in high school and even then I thought full on fursuits was a bit much but this was back in  before the much more appealing designer fursuits hit the stage. But all the same I wore incredibly dull clothes. I hated drawing attention to myself. I hated people staring and commenting. I hated being anyones business. I hated people drawing assumptions just on how I looked saying I should be happy I should be this do that. Especially for a young person it can be overwhelming.Ive also suited much much later as an adult a couple years ago and I can totally get that feeling too. Its just pure fun. Youre not anyone but a fluffy character acting goofy and making people smile. If youre at a con theres tons of other people taking a break from life and acting goofy and having fun and making everyone else smile. Youre fully in control of  how you wish to be perceived people hating on costumers aside. Youre not your gender youre not your age youre not your skin color youre not your clothing choices youre only whatever you want people to see through the costume you put on.A lot of people want to jump to the conclusion that people who do this are mentally disturbed that this is escapism for people who cant cope with reality. I cant speak for every single individual who does this but taking small breaks from life in costume is no different from taking small breaks from life through video games or grabbing a drink with friends after work or going through a hike in the woods far away from society. Its just a break. I still hold down a job I still pay my taxes I still have friends completely uninvolved in the fandom and yes I do sometimes enjoy dressing nicely and turning heads when I hit the town.Its all about balance and finding what makes you happy. Theres no need for serious analysis about furries or costuming. If someone spent too much time in costume and had problems being out of costume Id view them the same as I would someone who spent all day in their basement playing video games and was afraid to go outside or someone who drank all the time. Mild escapism is necessary. Connecting with other people over a fun hobby and taking a break from life is crucial. But either way its all about balance and loving yourself in costume and out.,furry,d605kk2,53,t5_2qi2h

Inuniverse they are actully Sarrs cousins. The reason for this is that each of them is named after a kind of plant using the latin name specifically and those plants are in the same taxonomic family hence the characters named after them which includes my sona are cousins! Theres also another character Archie who is their ancestor from the distant past hes named after an extinct species from this family of plants known only by its fossils. Originally it was just Sarr but then I had the idea to have my sonas extended family in his universe correspond to the extended family of his namesake plant. In case you were wondering the particular family of plants that their names come from is Sarraceniaceae Each one of their names correspond to a single genus in the family.So enough rambling on about that specific group of characters because there are others too they just arent as significant.

This has lead to Trewari mostly being a species of rich oral tradition unlike the Phoenixes which have developed a form of writing. If she were trying to read what the phoenixes wrote shed probably need glasses or otherwise suffer from it looking rather blurry. They dont exist on Strathis though and her vision is normal for the species so she does not consider this a flaw.Fun fact like most foxes and wolves she is dichromatic and lacks the ability to see green which causes her to think her fur is yellow and brown.,furry,d6swe8v,1,t5_2qi2h

For instance his fur turns a ghostly white when hes afraid and his eyes will turn violet when hes enamored with someone.. His full name is Clayton James Tucker.. Clayton ALWAYS has at least one tooth missing from his face. This is because he is prone to getting them knocked out.. Clayton will go feral from time to time. Fortunately no one except for nearby foliage is in danger as a result of this.. Clayton used to have near perfect vision when he was a calf but around age  or so an accident left him with very poor vision needing glasses that he cant see without.,furry,d80p0or,3,t5_2qi2h

They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs. Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are harmonious and pleasing to the eye. Make sure you have enough contrast when choosing an analogous color scheme.  Why is purple a royal color  associated with royalty?gtThe color purple has been associated with royalty power and wealth for centuries. In fact Queen Elizabeth I forbad anyone except close members of the royal family to wear it. Purples elite status stems from the rarity and cost of the dye originally used to produce As for color in this respect  every culture looks at color differently.  In China white is for death and mourning but in America black is used.  So color meanings can vary greatly among cultures and among people.  Take some time do some google searches and maybe hit up your local library or bookstore and read the color theory books there.  They can do a lot better job explaining what you want to know then a bunch of randoms on the internet.,furry,d91u9ay,3,t5_2qi2h

Mental health is a serious issue and we dont need to muddy the water by asking the question Well are they REALLY depressed?And just like you said somebody who has never had depression might not correctly label thier feelings. But just because they arent informed about depression doesnt mean that they were acting out for attention and wouldnt benifit from the help.It really goes to what you stated about giving the benefit of the doubt. Sure it may be frustrating to help someone out only to later figure out they may have been faking it however not only is it difficult to find out if their disorder or sadness was illigetimate or not but the alternative of accusing someone of faking when they do need comfort is infinitely worse.,furry,d9c3mqv,3,t5_2qi2h

9809193,0,t1_dalxnx5,They dont care.  I think this whole trend of bashing people who treat it as anything more than lol its just a hobby who cares is an attempt by some people to draw a line between themselves and those cringy furries.The same reason we often dont tell people about being a furry openly  that it has a negative connotation to those outside the fandom  makes them want to distance themselves from the rest of us weirdos.  Honestly i think its a bunch of virtue signaling garbage used to prop themselves up over other furries because they feel uncomfortable with being part of a fandomsubculturewhatever that a lot of people look down upon.  If a significant part of who you are is something weird or looked down upon youre going to naturally keep that away from people so they dont get a negative impression of you.  But it feels bad to keep such a big part of yourself a secret from the people in your life that you care about  to feel like you cant talk about it for fear that their impression of you will change negatively.  So its normal to want to relieve all that mental pressure by coming out about it. But thats hard and puts you at considerable social risk  what if the friend you tell is weirded out and doesnt want to associate with you anymore?  People are naturally risk averse.   So instead of telling anyone you bottle up all that resentment inside and try to convince yourself you dont need to do it.  And then you make threads  on the Internet putting down people who have the same problem because it makes you feel better and try to pretend the problem doesnt exist because thats so much easier and safer than trying to solve it.Its toxic.   ,furry,dam6yqp,1,t5_2qi2h

10020865,0,t1_dbdpjm3,As far as Zootopia goes or any disney show really theyve been doing it for a long time. Donald Duck Mickey Mouse even Tales Spin though I think theyve evolved into what would be much more Furry and less just animals in clothes.Kemonomimi stems from Japan and animemanga where cat ears and tails were considered very cute. It is still a big thing in that area as well. If we really look at ourselves Playboy bunnies fall into that category imo. But I think the inclusion of Kemonomimi into the furrydom is because of a couple of things. We are trying to categorize two very different cultures variations.. Some variations of kemonomimi are more indepth than just ears and a tail.But I agree human characteristics to animals is the stronger definition of Furry. We may have to look at Kemonomimi animal characterisitcs given to humans as a bridge between two worlds and a bit of a copout.,furry,dbdqvx2,3,t5_2qi2h

10117054,0,t1_dbo7rel,I kind of understand your frustration a bit. Im into the sexual side as well and whenever I come to this subreddit its not all the time but I occasionally feel like we try to downplay it too much. I get that there are some plenty? of us who arent interested in it but trying to wave our hands and go Look! Its not all about the sex! isnt necessarily going to be the best approach. It tootransparently tries to compensate for our expectation that whoever is listening holds the belief that were  about sexfetishes and I think that wed come off as more genuine and in my experience with people in the fandom wed be more accurate if we gave a more direct nod to the role of sex and sexuality here.This problem in my experience is a bit more prevalent in the rfurry venue. Id suggest that this is due partly to the fact that this subreddit serves a statistically younger audience than say a convention and partly to the fact that the things we say here are pretty publicly visible as compared to say a Telegram group so we make a greater effort to split the SFW and NSFW themes.Regarding your other comment about the alienation of fursuit sex I think it just suffers from the same problem taken to a greater extent. This community has both sexual and social aspects to it and the line blurs sometimes when for example you get porn of the same character you use as an icon online or something. But thats just pictures  a fursuit is a real physical thing so discussion around it can be a hell of a lot more polarizing.Personally over my time spent with people in the community Ive developed a more sexpositive mindset than I used to have and I feel wed all be way better off if that was more commonplace. But I know that its not so I have tended towards figuring out what aspect each expression of furry represents to me on a casebycase basis. Yeah my fursuit is nice and expensive and I dont want to mess it up but you can just be careful and not get stuff on it  I think the bigger reason I dont think I want to have sex in it is that I feel it to be a social item first. If I later decide that I want to get around that and really want to have sex in a suit Ill get a second cheaper one for fucking in. Its not really true to the entanglement between furry as both a socialsexual subject and I dont feel its how the subject should necessarily be tackled in the general sense seriously its just sex but I think itd be more compatible with the average person which I prioritize for some reason.     ,furry,dbq9d9s,1,t5_2qi2h

10176496,0,t3_5loqee,In my world all of its inhabitants would be more like what you see in furry art such as being of similar height and build so not like Zootopia in that sense. The species distribution would be more like the real world instead of everyone and their dog being some sort canine as a third of the fandom seems to be. However not all animals would be anthropomorphic specifically avians insectoids and aquatic creatures.If an animal is digitigrade in real life their digitigrade in my fantasy. This makes shoes very rare in most cultures only being used in specific circumstances but footwraps do exist and are considered an optional accessory. Most creatures would also have five fingers and four toes.Taurs most hybrids and fantasy creatures wouldnt exist mainly for scientific reasons. Interspecies relationships do exist but are uncommon and considered taboo by some similar to samesex relationships today.Creatures would follow similar color patterns to real life animals and would retain other speciesspecific features such as a good sense of smell color blindness or coldbloodedness.As far as food goes I havent really thought about it but there are some feral animals that could still be eaten such as fish.Racism or speciesism would exist to a point but doesnt carry as much weight compared to real world racism as there are major differences between species. Because of this creatures tend to live with and marry within their own species and more rural towns can sometimes be of a single species but most cities are fairly progressive and have a wide variety of species. The world in general is a lot more progressive than ours being sexpositive and accepting of samesex marriages. The more modernized western world is very peaceful and mostly irreligious with religion that does exist being common in smaller more isolated communities.,furry,dbxk8op,1,t5_2qi2h

Take peoples advice in terms of design if you like but it all comes down to what you find appealingcomfortable in the end. Maybe that means you want something showy and flamboyant or maybe you just want something more downtoearth regularlooking. Maybe you dont want one in the first place. All are fine options.There is something to be said for how other people will react to your fursona and maybe not having something completely ridiculous but it all comes down to how much you think that matters to you.

10453879,0,t3_5ppvwc,Basically its a very small community despite its widespread notoreity where people enjoy extremely freeform creative play that is childlike yet adult and unbound by any rule except that everybody is here to have a good time. People create all sorts of really weird stuff that you would never expect even after being a part of it for years and a lot of them are really passionate about it and it makes for just plain weird and interesting and fun experiences. If you just plain love weird stuff as I do youll never run out here.I think the main reason for the hate is people view the really childlike innocence of play as immature or inappropriate for adults to do. Myself I think everybody has an innocent kid inside them somewhere. If you know the famous song Puff the Magic Dragon its about how kids invent fantastic beasts and imaginary creatures when they are little but eventually forget all that and grow up. Some people like to just reserve a special little place for those fantastic beasts.That said due to these aspects it does end up containing a lot of very odd people in the form of very clinically anxious or transgendered or those genuinely mentally underdeveloped or autistic types and thats fine I think those people deserve a place to rest as we all do but they remain odd.The best part about it I agree with uPropMaster abovegtIts a community that is selfgenerating content without outside media relianceIts a truly non corporate yet content rich community basically to participate at all you create stuff and I think thats awesome. Other communities that are desperately dependent upon large corporations to dole out content have a very different often much more unfriendly feeling.That also creates a natural community defense as well. The community is the people and it naturally ebbs and flows among venues and communication tools. It cannot be harmed or destroyed because it arose naturally and flows naturally as people come up with new content and ideas naturally. Its not super active and it never has big announcements but it has a nice slow pace and people flow in and out as inspiration and free time are less or more.EDIT A lot of people say its a safe space or a hugbox. Thats not the case. Its more of an office type environment or smalltown environment. If you troll be useless and negative or cause drama or just complain a lot people are going to hate and ostracize you even if you have amazing creative skills. Even if all you do is make your artscraftswriting and try to be polite and nice sooner or later you will get roped into some of the most excruitiatingly awkward situations that you cant even imagine right now and youll have to find a way to escape out of them.That said all the stuff I said above is still true.,furry,dct1tlb,5,t5_2qi2h

10538593,0,t3_5qwnam,Do not be afraid to seek help in the form of a psychologist or counselor. There should never be any shame in this. Even if it is just a school counselor.I am assuming since you said kids you are in high school or middle school? Kids can be awful. Your age group may be playing a role? A good rule of thumb is to not be too open with furry stuff around teenagers and pre teens. I felt like this throughout high school because I too was bullied all the time for being a nerd plus a horrible home life. Usually it gets somewhat better. Although adults can be petulant bullies as well. Some people just suck.Furry is a huge community because it is such a broad interest. There will be plenty of awful people as well because of this. It sounds like you found some really bad people in this fandom. Honestly it is better to remove yourself from toxic people. I spent so many years with a friend who was toxic and toxic exes because they manipulated me into staying by their side. Life has been so much better since we went our seperate ways. You really need to cut people out of your life as much as possible who always try to bring you down if at all possible. Try to ignore the haters as hard as that seems. ,furry,dd2nzzx,1,t5_2qi2h

I have an explosive mood that feels like it does not end and sometimes I feel like I do dumb things because of it. Like a pressure that even if it built up only when I was young I thought it would have disappeared and been let out by now but its like a balloon with endless helium.I also feel like a narcissist cant avoid talking about myself even in this thread so I try to help people but then I tire myself out. I guess I just dunno how to take care of myself properly. I lack the motivation to go exercise for some reason which is not good for my health and I should try and find a job or passions but I am so restless that it is hard to focus and also afraid of trying to pursue my dreams. And then all this worrying tires me out.I dunno I mostly needed to vent anyone can give advice or just attention or support if they wanna.. Or even take out anger or frustration at me.

10567411,0,t1_dd5vydk,Oh no its fine! DWell what actually happened was that I discovered it was shutting down on Dec th and promptly spent all of December trying to figure out how to solve this. There was a false start that wasted a week but after that I basically sat down and figured out how to make my own crawler.That went quite well  until around the start of . Unfortunately between either an unidentified disruption of one or more of the things I take for mental clarity or just plain simple burnout my outputcapacity diminished by a lot. I basically slowed down in spite of myself and I cant figure out how to get back to the speed I was going at before.So its like one of those dreams where youre screaming or trying to move and nothings coming out and youre stuck  the data I want to archive is right there imagine you were a rabbit and you were staring at a planetsized carrot and yet Im not actually downloading it. A friend has even prepared an Amazon Cloud Drive account to store up to TB of the data on this website theres PB of data there so Id have to be careful and prioritize thats assuming I make it that far and I havent even gotten that far yet.Its mostly just the ability to focusthink clearly which is kind of a prerequisite to figuring out software architecture. For the past  days or so Ive been fussing around with what to name the functions in my program instead of the overall functionality its like I have writers block or something. But I think Im getting there Im not as bad as I was a couple days ago today actually my Mum  who manages what I take D  made some adjustments which I think has helped so Ill see how I go today.My main problem now is the fact that Web browsers arent ADHDproof. To Chrome theres no difference between looking up PHP function documentation or spending  hours on HN or visiting Imgur.

I keep getting confused with this other sergal just because our patterns are similar but its cool since both characters are different and I am not claiming to be him.Just make a simple search in FA or so just to make sure your design is not identical to someone elses but do it after you finish your design so you can keep it original. If its too similar in your opinion you can add some accessories like a scarf or glasses or such or make the character itself different e.g grumpy instead of happy or stuff like thatNot many people worry about copying characters unless you are outright copying some unique features of someone that can be easily identified,furry,ddif2fm,2,t5_2qi2h

While rather more adaptable than their feral ancestors anthros still have bodies and features that are to some degree specially adapted to the climate of their area of origin. A polar bears thick fur will make them overheat in a desert while a fennec foxs heatradiating ears will freeze them in the tundra. Granted those are extreme examples but for a long time most species couldnt comfortably live in a climate very different from their own.In the age of imperialism while Canis laid waste to the temperate northern territories of Miranda several times the tropical southern territories were out of the reach of the temperateadapted Caniseans who couldnt fight effectively or live comfortably there. Species stayed in weather similar to what they were adapted to wars between differentclimate nations were mostly limited to border skirmishes and countries that had different climate areas in their territory were by nature very decentralized.That started to change with the coming of the industrial age when effective heating and cooling systems started showing up in buildings vehicular warfare was introduced and living outside ones climate became possible. Nowadays backmounted electric heating and cooling packs along with other specialized clothes let anthros walk around comfortably in a climate theyre not adapted to immigration and tourism are quickly becoming more popular and wars can truly be fought worldwide.

I wanted to program but didnt think I would be any good at it so I didnt even try until I was in college. My advice would be to get a part time job at a gas station or convenience store and attend some classes at a local community college. Any part time work you get is going to suck but youll probably have to just deal with that for the time being. If your family is okay with you staying with them for a while perhaps you could just take several varying classes. See what you enjoy out of all of them and pursue that. Nobody really knows what theyre going to like until they get a taste of it and it sounds like you just havent found what you want yet.As for being awkward around people it just takes practice. I was awful at small talk until I had a job at a cash register. Throwing yourself out there and getting through it could be just what you need but who knows?

11509721,0,t3_64agaz,Im not a regular of this place just got asked to post my cents here since this is a question I handle a lot elsewhere but hopefully I can still offer something of interest. When tackling any question relating to disorders you first must define what you mean by disorder. Using the DSMV the handbook used by many psych professionals a disorder is defined as gtA mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individuals cognition emotion regulation or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social occupational or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss such as the death of a loved one is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior e.g. political religious or sexual and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual as described above.Emphases mine. Basically in order for something to be a disorder it cant simply be deviant aka not in line with whats considered normal. It must also cause on a clinically significant level at least one of the following distress dysfunction or danger. Under this definition being a furry in itself is not a disorder no more than being gay or liking Star Wars is. Fun fact being gay was once classed as a mental disorder some decades back. Theres also still strife w.r.t. diagnoses related to being transgender. Unfortunately psychiatry is no more immune to social biases than most other humanmade institutionsthis is something that is of utmost importance to keep in mind when discussing disorders. AnywaygtI guess the basis of my question is thus is there a correlation with being a furry and with having an identity disorder and if there is is it necessarily a negative to not have a concrete identity? Thanks thoughts and musings appreciated.Im having trouble answering your question directly because I cant tell what you consider a disorder or not. The way youve phrased your question almost makes it sound like you consider LGBT identities disordered but Im pretty sure thats not the actual case. Theres a lot of directions to take with it. I do think the furry communitys more open about alternate expressions of identity than most other fandoms. Its got a reputation for being accepting and you also have fursonas which a big part of the fandom revolves aroundhaving your fursona drawn roleplay stories fursuiting etc. With that all in mind I wouldnt be surprised if the fandom attracts people who are exploring their identities or who otherwise have nonstandard identities disordered or not. But without the exact numbers Im not comfortable giving exact answers. My suspicion is that its all more complicated than anyone knows. Is it a negative to not have a concrete identity? Its entirely what you make of it. Can go either way. Mine is certainly less concrete than the norm but its been adaptive overall despite some unique griefs that come with it. I personally dont think having a fluid identity is in itself a disorder. ,furry,dg0mmt7,4,t5_2qi2h
