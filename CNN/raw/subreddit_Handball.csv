183716,0,t1_cezcvg9,Luka Karabatic never played in a big tourney before this one. Anic and Dumoulin are in the same position. Nyokas also. Thats a lot of players for us we fielded almost the same team for  years.,Handball,cezd1vy,2,t5_2rr72
420345,0,t1_cfnrjg1,We do a pretty thorough warmup at training  some running and stretches etc. Then after that we do some light passing etc for  minutes before warming up the goalkeepers. Its usually during the last bit that the elbow starts hurting then subsides a bit toward the end of the session.,Handball,cfoc1pm,1,t5_2rr72
834074,0,t1_cgyhgup,Great defense  hardly but he was in a fine position and in my opinion Uwe did not have it easy.,Handball,cgz34gf,1,t5_2rr72
2409498,0,t1_cm9chqd,You may be right. Considering that no TV station has bought the rights to broadcast the tournament yet we might all have to watch the matches through an illegal alJazeera stream with Arabic commentators.I also wonder how many spectators will show up to the matches...,Handball,cm9iu67,2,t5_2rr72

2913555,0,t3_2ti0bk,I cant watch any of the games because Ive got to play a game myself even though I was sick the last three days. Wish me luck guys. France  Sweden and Danemark  Poland should be two pretty exciting games. Also Russia  Argentina and Egypt  Iceland are gonna be close calls. Great gameday!,Handball,cnza1re,2,t5_2rr72
2971631,0,t1_co5vvh6,Maybe they were the better team on the field today. But something needs to be done to the rules otherwise every country with money can start assembling a team of foreigners to play for them. The  year rule is ridiculous. ,Handball,co5w1j3,6,t5_2rr72

3885102,0,t1_cqny053,Had nothing to do with hansen he was terrible in the finale at parken and he was a huge liability for a while playing for ag kbenhavn hence why he was often played on the righteventually started scoring more goals but never really knew how to assist or defend back then would maybe score  goals against a poor team and  against kiel not exactly figures that attract attendances.Id say even the foreigners brought more fans than mikkel. The danish fans would have been there regardless of mikkel or not but when kasi proved they could spend on real world class talent then obviously people took the sport more seriously something nobody does anymore.,Handball,cqz4vm8,2,t5_2rr72
4024111,0,t3_32h12x,I dont know if it will work on floors. But Ill give you a tip that I have been doin for years. To remove resin from your hands use babyoil. It works far better than expensive resinremovers is a lot cheaper and leaves your hands soft instead of drying them out like resin removers do. Baby oil dissolves resin quickly but if you want to use it on floors i suggest using a normal fatdissolving detergent after to prevent the floors becoming slippery,Handball,crez8sy,1,t5_2rr72

6286916,0,t1_cz48rjv,Mayor changes inside the squad. There is potential for the future but we are not that good atm. Honestly i think Poland has a good chance to get in the semifinals. No team in group B showed much.,Handball,cz4928a,3,t5_2rr72

10010170,0,t3_5fkt9u,This bronze match is unwatchable so far to me. Denmarks players seem to be having a contest in ineptness with the referees. I dont think Ive ever seen a team get away with as many instances of blatant travelling as France are this game. Its ridiculous. I counted at least  separate instances of travelling on ONE series which is almost as many times as Denmark have shot directly at Leynauds midriff.KBJ is rightfully furious about it too and quite frankly I wouldnt be surprised if he got himself ejected in the second half. Lord knows its bad for my blood pressure  I wont even begin to imagine what its like for him.Edit With the match now concluded my assessment of the refereeing performance stands  it was an outright fucking disgrace to the sport. Props to Denmark for making a game of it despite being so many goals down at half time but they win this game comfortably if the referees would just fucking open their eyes and call travelling.,Handball,dbccraf,2,t5_2rr72
10381517,0,t3_5n201g,I saw a discord post somewhere. I was wondering if some like the idea of a handball discord or IRC channel. I know it wouldnt see much use outside the big tournaments. But maybe people like the idea and want to talk about handball.,Handball,dckt539,1,t5_2rr72
10451622,0,t3_5ppfvu,Im in the sweden camp if they win then Icelandic coaches will hold all  major titles. Which is something to celebrate while our national team is going through a rough period of switching out the olympic silver medal team for the new young blood.,Handball,dcsshu2,6,t5_2rr72
10469002,0,t3_5py6wm,Sloppy last  minutes from Sweden which may have cost them the game. But its hard to defend against Narcisse in beast mode.,Handball,dcurodp,2,t5_2rr72
10519431,0,t1_dd08cfv,You guys played great. O god anyone who says that should stop watching sports. We had a lead at the end of the second half. We had a penalty for finals. Also we played like garbage. How did they play then lol. But yea i am . Comfort yourself with that thought. Cant wait for sunday.  goal difference atleast,Handball,dd0hp0f,-5,t5_2rr72
10525137,0,t3_5qpy8y,Good lord what a game. But seriously commiserations to Croatia. I just feel bad for you.
