2006706,0,t3_2hoyky,I hate to say it but its pretty common. Being a girl on voice chat is an invitation to be criticized for stupid things or hit on or both. My advice is to find a cool stack and then use an external voice client with them like Mumble or Teamspeak or whatever. And this subreddit and rGirlGamers are good places to find people to play with!,GGDota2,ckv080e,2,t5_326do
