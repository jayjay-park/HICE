These products are on par or better than products in the same price bracket manufactured under sweatshoprd world conditions.  If you want  pairs of boxers for  bucks by all means purchase Hanes.

It seems the formula for keeping American manufacturing strong is as follows Workforce education Trade school apprenticeships free community college as in Tennessee Exports We are the rd or nd largest exporter in the world yet only  of manufacturers exports.  Simply doubling this would have a great economic effect.  Market Penetration We need the Department of Commerce and other agencies to aggressively promote our wares overseas.

6723783,0,t3_47pje9,Define what water proof means in this context. Most plastic parts are dense and uniform enough as opposed to something like foam that they will prevent water from getting to one side to the other. Thats not to say they are completely impervious to water since some plastics have a tendency to absorb moisture which distorts their size. This property is known as water absorption and is typically found on the data sheet of the resin you are molding. This usually comes into play if you are worried about say the size of  gear changing in a submerged gearbox as opposed to a housing keeping water out of an area. If you are asking how to make an assembly of plastic parts water resistant such as the case around a digital camera than that is an entirely different ball of wax. In that case you have to design the assembly to be water resistant not just the parts themselves. This typically involves gaskets seals tortorus paths etc... to prevent water from getting into your device. There are entire books written on this subject you could start by researching IPX ratings gasket design weatherproofing etc... ,manufacturing,d0espyn,1,t5_2qz70

10388854,0,t3_5orwc6,Interesting.  I hadnt heard of it.I read this... gt A simple application of the blockchain paradigm to the supply chain would be to register the transfer of goods on the ledger as transactions that would identify the parties involved as well as the price date location quality and state of the product and any other information that would be relevant to managing the supply chain.gt The public availability of the ledger would make it possible to trace back every product to the very origin of the raw material used.At first I was thinking we already have invoices and EDI has been nothing but a turd for everyone but the highest moving industries.  But the public availability is the difference.  And the reason it wont catch on.  There is a lot of value in developing a reliable supply chain.  Many companies are not going to be too fond of letting their competitors know all the vendors they use.Some specialized industries such as pharma may find this to be acceptable to get the immutable chain of transactions but I think many are going to balk at the cost complexity and openness.,manufacturing,dcln3yu,5,t5_2qz70
