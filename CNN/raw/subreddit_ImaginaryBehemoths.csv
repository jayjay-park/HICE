3309883,0,t1_cp5h8wo,In order for these kinds of things to be possible our understanding of physics and biology would be rendered obsolete and the reality we live in would change fundamentally. Being on another planet isnt going to change how the universe functions.Energy isnt created by lifeforms it is absorbed from other sources. Efficiency of energy absorption is only going to be able to do so much and wont change the fact that massive creatures would need a great deal of energy to operate. The possibility of other fundamentally different universes in which such creatures could exist is irrelevant to the topic because the initial post explicitly said that these types of creatures do exist which is an unsubstantiated claim that is incompatible with our understanding of how the universe works.Finally making assumptions isnt necessarily a bad thing especially if they are backed with reasoning. When you get right down to it the only thing that isnt an assumption is cogito ergo sum or I think therefore I am and even that is debatable. So saying who knows is just unnecessarily muddying the waters.,ImaginaryBehemoths,cp5jyha,-1,t5_2y6nh
