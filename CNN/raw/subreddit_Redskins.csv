He didnt seem to have a problem benching him.gt It says you promised me youd let me start the season if you dont then ....then what? If he didnt start he was going to quit the team?

80389,0,t1_cenksjn,gt eligible for the practice squad.I didnt realize that.  Until I googled it I never realized there were so many rules.Still the point standing is hes an upgrade from Grossman and he seems to have enough all around skill to be useful to the team in other ways.  Everyone whos worked with him has said that hes nothing but a positive energizing influence SOMEBODY has to be the holder and you dont want to make it your starting QB.  Hed be an interesting dual threat out of a fake kick he seems like hed be a good all around guy to have for what hes charging.  Lets look at it this way. Lets assume that a rd QB is necessary which is a reasonable assumption with the state of the team.  You can either have Grossman back take Tebow or draft a rookie.  Which one do you take?  To me theres no question there but Im sure the redskins will do something nuts like get Vick drop Grossman trade cousins and end up with two injured QBs sitting the bench by week ,Redskins,cenkxmj,1,t5_2r4wc

154155,0,t1_cevz3mm,Its no problem with the offseason Im sure we will discuss it a few times. Since I wrote this post Ive had a change of heart on a few things anyways so its worth starting a new thread.I wrote OT as a need. I should have said OG. Polumbus has really stepped up and I think we are set at tackle. I think we need a new starting Right Guard. We could frankly do better at Center too in fact a few of our problems stemmed from poor blocking assignments that starts with good leadership at the Center position.Wide receiver has become more important to me. Fact is our defense is mediocre across the board with the exception of like  players and we arent going to fix it in free agency. We will only have a good to great unit with smart drafting and time and thats not even a guarantee. What we have now is a QB with unlimited potential one of the best running backs in the NFC an exciting young TE a top  WR and a solid offensive line. Lets do what we can with the defense to make them averageatbest and then lets give RG some more weapons to win it with our offense. Depending on best talent available I definitely wouldnt mind our first pick being at WR.,Redskins,cevzmzo,10,t5_2r4wc

There are people who will be bothered by anything and just because there are a few people that raise issue with something does not mean they need to be catered to. There are in fact problems in the world so minor that the solution is not to fix them but to simply get over it and this is one of them.What I think is interesting though is that nobody has any issue with the New York Yankees. It was coined as a disparaging term for Americans by the British and also by the South during the bloodiest war America has ever fought in. The negative connotation of the words origin isnt even debated. We do have a professional sports team named after a racial slur a slur that is still used today in the south with actual hate behind it. We just accept it as the name of a Sports team and not something that is meant to support racism.,Redskins,cic43p0,0,t5_2r4wc

He almost got  at the half. He was more poised and was more controlled than RGIII has been in the past. Im a fan of RGIII and I have been defending him for a long time but he is inconsistent at times and a lot of times doesnt look comfortable. Hes accurate and can run. Those are his advantages. Kirk Cousins advantages is hes a better quarterback and makes better game decisions. He doesnt allow momentum to dictate his performance as much. On top of all of that Im never scared that hes going to get hurt.This was only one game so we shouldnt run with the numbers too much but I think Cousins has the ability to develop into a solid quarterback.,Redskins,ckib57e,6,t5_2r4wc

In the current version of the rules on the NFL website you will notice that the rules no longer simply state that the QB is defenseless at any time after a change of possession as you cited on the contrary the rules direct you to the paragraph I referenced in my comment for more information on how the QB can be contacted after a change of possession note that it specifically references a conventional block against the QB.

He didnt play very many snaps last year and hes only getting older.  He played  of the snaps he was active for. Baker only played  and Jenkins only played . He actually played the most out of all of our defensive lineman. Those are low numbers when compared with JJ Watt or like Sheldon Richardson but maybe HaslettDline coach just liked to keep our guys fresh? No idea.   gt I think we may need to resign Jarvis Jenkins simply because well need the bodies and hes youngcheap no?  Seeing as the above is the case we need more bodies to supplement the rotations. Jenkins is typically a good run stopper but he was god awful this season. If we sign him to something small and dirt cheap we can keep him as a rotational player but Im fine letting him walk and replacing him via the draft. We need multiple DEs.

4029974,0,t1_crfloud,gtIve said this they have similarities in the way they run. Youre being intentionally vague. Saying someone has an attribute is different than a running style. Is cam Newton the same as flacco because theyre both tall?gtClone was the incorrect term because I was thinking of physicality which I did not specify. So you have an argument on that. Yet youre so infatuated with being right because youre better than everyone that you are not willing to discuss the politics of word usage and how that relates to what I was trying to convey.No you replied to me and said I was wrong. I said they werent the same back and both would be worth keeping because they are different styles. You said they were the same thus no reason to support keeping both. gtI also pointed out several scouting quotes that compared Alfred to Jones I provided three instances in which they were determined to be similar. But again youre too ignorant to acknowledge that because you just NEED to be right.I provided scouting reports and such that specifically compare the two. You are picking an attribute like being hard to tackle and are inferring they are clones from that. No scouting report says Jones has a style like Morris because he doesnt. gtYou immediately set out to prove someone wrong because you COMPLETELY misinterpreted what I said. That makes you a complete douche bag.I said these two players can and should both on the roster and they serve different roles. ParaphraseYou said no thats not right because Jones is a morris clone. Should only keep one paraphrasegtTheir style of running. A typical ideal third down back will be shifter pass catch better and be able to block. Roy Helu was a much better candidate for that position. Matt Jones is a clone of Alfred but has better attributes in other areas. That doesnt mean they are compliments because he can do other things. He just offers more on other areas.Was your argument. I showed that they do not have a similar style of running. One relies on power the other on patience and vision. Theres more than one way to skin a cat and a small fast back isnt the only type of third down back. Being able to block on an obvious passing situation third and long is more important than being shifty in that scenario. Being able to pound it for short yard and goal line runs is something a small back cant do. He has the potential to be a great third down back especially if he can catch decently enough to be a reliable check down. ,Redskins,crfnbxw,2,t5_2r4wc

You dont leave a ProBowl level running back in the backfield without using him even in critical times. That breeds failure. No high level team strays away from the run.

Remember the ravens game when Kirk tossed an embarrassing pick and then almost fumbled the ball the next possession. But then had time to get in rhythm and perform. RG never got that chance because gruden lied about it being roberts team and played him sparingly as you would a starter in the preseason. He really never gave him a short to win the job. The way Gruden handled picking a QB whether you like RG or not was disgraceful. Gruden got his way and went about it with the subtelty of a gorilla.,Redskins,cv3n53r,3,t5_2r4wc

5436588,0,t1_cw6j6gi,gt There are teams with mediocrebad QBs that can still win games look at the Broncos. Peyton is statistically one of the worst in the league this year but his defense and special teams have bailed him out.Oh absolutely.  The Broncos have a ridiculously talented defense.  Its stacked with probowl talent.  There are tons of teams that have gone far in the playoffs behind a poor QB and a great defense and a great run game.  Mark Sanchez was the QB for two Jets teams that went to the AFCCG.  Rex Grossman was a QB in the Super Bowl.gtTeams that are complete all the way around can support a QB when hes having a rough day enough to get by.Yes but you mentioned almost.  For most circumstances with most teams that do not also have a great run game and a great defense that does not apply.  For the  Bears Broncosetc sure they can be the exception.gtI think when healthy our team was almost there.Im curious when we began this season how well did you think we would do?  What did you project our winloss record to be?  My memory for the general consensus was about .  Were you considerably more optimistic?Our run defense has given up almost  yards combined for the past  games.  Weve had a few injuries but our front  is relatively healthy.  Our own rushing offense has been terrible the past  games.

So if you get rid of Gruden you need to be at a point where you have no issue starting over at quarterback as well.  Personally I am not at that point.  I think that both Cousins and Gruden are average at their respective jobs but have shown improvement this year.  Let them each continue to grow assuming there isnt a regression and hit their ceilings and then make the decision.  Likewise I wouldnt feel comfortable throwing more draft picks at the QB position while Gruden is still coach.,Redskins,cxu7egg,1,t5_2r4wc

6131103,1,t1_cymihay,dont have it right in front of me but I remember reading something about Scherff being one of the worst rated Olineman through the first X number of games in the season.  Its good that he is rated better for whatever PFF is worth but still you dont want to draft the th best guard with a top  pick that is not value. People even debate on value of a top  guard with a top  pick but I would be OK with that.  If he is going to play guard the standard is Pro Bowl or bust. If he is just middle of the road then you had a huge opportunity cost with that pick even if he is a nice solid contributor. Maybe he becomes that maybe not we dont really have signs either way right now if he has that elite level within him.Murphy is an OK player who we reached on and hasnt exactly lived all the way up to his draft position but has slightly surpassed what I expected of him too and Preston Smith has not blown him out of the water. He was another one where it seemed a little early and to me at the time didnt seem like a super great fit for our needs hence why we still felt it was worth it to sign Junior Gallette. And yes there is no denying his sack numbers they are higher than I would have thought they could have been.  But other than the sacks themselves he isnt having huge impacts on the game. When you watch him in a game he doesnt look like a dominant pass rusher so its hard to tell if these numbers will keep up but the numbers themselves are undeniable and are worthy of the draft position for an OLB.  But I would have preferred a few less sacks and a more visible presence where teams have to account for him and where he establishes himself as a clear upgrade from Murphy.Yes Jones has done well as a pass catcher on screen plays and he is a good down hill runner but Jones in the third doesnt seem like value to me when Karlos Williams went in the th they are pretty similar to me.Crowder has had a bigger impact than most th rounders but that is just in the nature of taking a player in that mold. Cole Beasly Julian Eddleman Wes Welker these are th round to undrafted types for whatever reason you can just get players like this any time you want. Thats why I would have liked Lockett in the rd because he is more of an elite athlete or someone like Stefon Diggs in the th who is more of a D Jax replacement and then Grant can keep on doing his thing establishing his niche in the offense.Arie Koundjiao is not playing over Spencer Long who is nothing special.  We took him over Kwon Alexander who would have been a better pick than Spaight in my opinion.Yes I meant Reiter before really could have benefited with that pick working people loved the trade back but with the pick we gave up Seattle took Pro Bowler Tyler Lockett and the next two picks werent too bad in Strong and Grasu.

6166166,0,t3_3zxxs6,Anyone remember the  Seahawks hosting and beating the  Saints back in .  That to me was a travesty but we have one less win than the Pack literally the smallest margin not counting ties here.  Its more common than youd think for a division winner to host the top wildcard team with a better record.  Last year the  Panthers hosted the  Cardinals.  In  the  Eagles hosted the  Saints and the  Packers hosted the  ers.  In  The  Ravens hosted the  Colts and the  Redskins hosted the  Seahawks.  In  The  Giants hosted the  Falcons  Broncos hosted the  Steelers. In  there was of course the previously referenced Seahawks Saints matchup but also a  Colts team hosting the  Jets  Chiefs hosted the  Ravens.  That makes  out of  Wild Card games where the wild card team had a better record.  In this current playoff format  of the time the Divison winner in the first round of the playoffs has a worse record than the away team.  CBS its time to start watching your own shitty NFL broadcasts...oh now I get it they dont.  Division winners with a worse record than their opponents are  in the Wild Card round.

Also you can find something that offends anyone. Thats a slippery slope. You change your name because a few people dont like it then whats next? Will the state of Oklahoma need to change its name? Oklahoma was the final destination of the trail of tears. The name of the state translates to Red People in Chocktow. Will husky hairy homosexual men decide that Bears offends them?Will the religious decide that saints offends them? Or people who are agnostic or atheists? Whatever happened to separation of church and stadium anyway? Yankees is a slur in the exact same way as Redskins in fact Yankee is still very much used in the south. Redskin is an outdated term that is not used by anyone that isnt talking football. If you bow to pressure for something so meaningless you let people pat themselves on the back and act like theyve done a good thing for native Americans when in fact native Americans have actual real problems that need fixing much more than the name of a football team. Poverty the employment rate and drug use are real problems that reservations need real help with. If the name is forced to change people will say we did a good thing and turn their attention to the next crusade.Ultimately its not up to me. If it were I wouldnt change the name. If I were forced to change it. By the league or whomever? Id go with Hogs. But personally I dont see a problem with the name. Let people be offended if theyre offended.

When kicking or sprinting large amounts of stress are applied to the hip flexor. This stress can result in a hip flexor strain. A hip flexor strain is the tearing or stretching of a muscle or a tendon according to KapiOlani Orthopaedic Associates. The hip flexor may become inflamed and painful. A hip flexor strain requires treatment.Hip Flexor Strain TreatmentStep Visit your family doctor. If you suspect you have a hip flexor strain a trip to your family doctor can help to determine exactly what is wrong. An examination of your hip and thigh will allow your doctor to come to a diagnosis. Further testing may be required if your doctor suspects a severe strain or further injury.Step Ice your hip flexor muscles. Place ice packs on your injury for  minutes at a time. You should ice your hip flexor every three to four hours. Continue this treatment for the next two to three days or until you are painfree.,Redskins,d7q35lj,2,t5_2r4wc

They promote him going up for fades all week on Twitter.... and then put him in play  the redzone. I called the play before it happened because I saw them running it with him on twitter. It just seemed so dumb.I have always been a Kirk defender but unlike the Pitt game that loss was almost exclusively on him. Not only did he throw that HORRIBLE interception in the redzone but he missed a couple open throws that would have been .He overthrew Jackson TWICE on what would have been TDs and then underthrew Docston and made a TD into just a large gain.Kirk needs to wake up here because he is starting to lose the locker room.

Dont go credit Barry for those because his scheme didnt make them happen the players should be credited.When I talk about coaching I see a failure in regards to putting players into positions to make plays. Yes we lack talent but thats not an excuse for the same mistakes like I mentioned in my first comment every week. Barry is failing to correct these mistakes by not changing his scheme and adapting to the guys we have on our roster. Hes running the same stuff every week and we are getting thrashed.What would have him do? Well our D Line is weak and ineffective in both pressuring the passer and stopping the run. Solution? Blitz more. Secondly Bruton is absolute trash. Ihenacho should be given a shot. Also your comment about Compton is unwarranted. Watch the film he shedsfills pretty well. Hes been a bright spot in the defense so far.,Redskins,d8bprus,2,t5_2r4wc

9171213,0,t1_d8ehyfm,There are so many reasons I dont want Jay to leave. The biggest reason is because he takes the stereotype of an NFL coach and pisses on it. Its not like Spurrier where he just slacked off. Its just that Jay doesnt seem to believe he has to be a god to the players. He just needs to be someone they respect and want to play for.It actually reminds me of how players described Gibbs. The main difference is Gruden likes to swear and Gibbs never did. Players didnt give their all for Gibbs because they were scared of him. They gave their all for Gibbs because they respected that man too much to give any less.Every year with Jay I see more growth from him as a coach. Im convinced hell be a damn fine head coach who wins meaningful games in January and possibly February some day. It just remains to be seen if thats in Washington or elsewhere.

9708060,0,t3_5e4u4d,. Rodgers is not underperforming. He has every single TD for the pack this year and has been playing like his usual self over their  game losing streak.. Kirk Cousins just threw for  TDs ints and put up the most points all year against the Vikings. Best defense in the NFL. Youre delusional if youre going to disrespect his performance last night by claiming that he was just taking advantage of a beaten up defense. . Did you watch the first fucking game against the Cowboys this year? It was a miracle that they won the game when we were going in to extend the lead late in the fourth. . You are vastly overrating what a few hours difference between a Sunday night game and a Sunday day game is going to do as far as having an affect on the two teams performances on Sunday..

9725329,0,t3_5eek3f,I was a bit surprised by how little we saw Foster but my guess is just due to the matchup. Rodgers can move a bit and their running game has been trash so having the more athletic Cravens makes a bit of sense. Well probably see more Foster this week due to Zeke but Daks mobility leads me to think well still see plenty of Cravens. A lot of that might depend on how the game is going. I think a lot of what Compton does is tough for us to gauge. A lot of people talk about his football IQ and him being the QB of the defense. If thats true I dont think hell be coming off the field often even if the other two guys are making more plays. For me Im happy when all three of those guys are on the field. There is definitely room for improvement but I dont think were really vulnerable with any of them which is something we couldnt say last year. ,Redskins,dabuyyf,1,t5_2r4wc

In fact more than scheme playcalling and adjustments my argument for getting rid of Barry is that our guys are consistently unable to execute the defense called rather than getting individually beat which does sometimes happen because we dont have great talent on defense. Yes the position coaches have something to do with that but when its the whole defense rather than a single position group you have to put at least some of the blame on the guy in charge of the unit. The offense and special teams do not seem to have this trouble so Im not going all the way up to Jay so it looks to stop at Joe Barry.,Redskins,dbr3gta,1,t5_2r4wc

Theres not a single NFC team that can reliably make the playoffs in the last  decades outside of the Reed  McNabb Eagles the Rodgers led Packers who have been bailed out by bad division play multiple times and very recently the Hawks who are starting to struggle now that they had to pay all their superstars.I always feel like people forget that there are  teams that spend the exact same amount of money and go through the exact same draft and FA process. The only reason a team like the Patriots can even exist is because they have an all time great head coach  QB partnership. Outside of that teams are only consistently good because other teams are consistently dysfunctional. If all teams had their shit figured out the teams that makes the playoffs vs. not would continually cycle every year and you would expect anything from  to  win seasons with occasional outliers.,Redskins,dbztoql,7,t5_2r4wc

Your graph actually shows a downward trajectory as the more positive outcome. Also the chart projects time passing from right to left and most folks would see time passing left to right.

I live in DC and all I hear is people who have no ties to the Patriots saying Nobody here is rooting for the Patriots or that The Patriots cheat or The Patriots win all the time.  The Patriots and Redskins did a joint preseason practice before one of the preseason games a few years ago. The Patriots are our ally and friend and Gruden seems to have a lot of respect for that organization lately Kornheiser has taken to lambasting Grudens insistence on defering calling him an unofficial Belichick wannabe.

10701725,0,t1_ddjrz1m,gt This is less about Bellicheat and more about Joe. Gibbs retired the first time around prematurely and only  years removed from coaching one of the greatest teams of all time. If he coached from  who knows what outcome wouldve resulted but its safe to say his teams wouldve at least continued making the playoffs.This is too much of a whatif scenario for me to really say anything further and I think youll agree.gt Agreed regarding this being chickenoregg scenario however you fail to point out Bellicheats lackluster Bradyless coaching stint with the Browns and the Pats  record in  with Drew Bledsoe. Aside from the Cassel season and the  season when things turned around  out of the  years he didnt have Brady starting things didnt go well for him.He went  with the Browns and had a playoff appearance. Lackluster? Sure you could say that but lets not pretend its as though he just did absolutely awful. was his first season with the Patriots and the only poor season he has had with the team.gt Also there is a long history of coaches only winning SBs with  QB e.g. LombardiStarr LandryStaubauch EliCoughlin etc. There are only a few QBs to win SBs with multiple coaches Manning Aikman Big Ben and Montana. This lends to argument that success is moreso attributed to QBs which is obviously compounded by Bradys greatness. This also adds to just how amazing Gibbs was being able to win with  different QBs none of which are in the HOF. Other than JG I think only Seifert was able to win with multiple QBs both made the HOF though.gt But you have to wonder though what if Gibbs had Brady or a top  QB from the s e.g. Marino Elway etc. Also what if Bellicheat didnt have Brady? Its fair to say he wouldnt have as many SBs.gt Regardless its an uphill battle for Gibbs simply because he doesnt have as many rings.The base fact is that Belichick has had more success than any head coach ever. To me that is the only argument needed. He has more impact over the team than any player can ever have. Nobody matches him in regards to being able to adjust the gameplan and play to the rosters strengths. Yes he has obviously benefited from having Brady but look at all the Superbowlwinning teams in the past  years. Nearly all of them had great QB play and quite a few wereare HOFquality players. Gibbs is a HOFer for a reason but again there just isnt an argument that could possibly convince me to pick him over Bill. For any one season with any team I would pick Bill to be my coach.,Redskins,ddjsxon,0,t5_2r4wc

So you make him prove it another year. The problem now is  he did that. And while I can see using the Tag to keep him on the team while you negotiate a new contract the notion that Kirk doesnt have all the leverage here is insane.  Franchise QBs always have the leverage. There are too many teams that have spent a decade looking for one that would be more than happy to overpay for these guys to not have leverage. Thats why they always have the highest contracts and take up the highest  of cap space. It isnt even a debate that the Skins need Kirk more than he needs the Skins.  The nd consectuvie Franchise Tag has raised the bottom line of an acceptable contract from what it was last year. Whatever the minimum yr he would have accepted last season its now raised by  millionyr. I dont see how any rational person could think that Kirk doesnt hold the leverage here.

I thibj being clutch is vastly overrated and maybe not even real but if you want to know what it means it means performing well under pressure. Again on Kirks scoring drive it was clutch. It doesnt matter whether or not stafford scored after that Kirk performed under pressure. On the final possession he was not clutch. I know thats an almost impossible situation to score from and Im not saying I blame him for not scoring or saying that it is bad that he didnt score there. But youre not going to say that any possession where you dont score is clutch. If he had scored that would be the epitome of Aaron Rodgers clutch play.I dont think its necessarily a fluke that quarterbacks like Matt Stafford Aaron Rodgers Tom Brady and Andrew Luck have an incredible ability to score at the end of games to win it I think they may be  clutch quarterbacks. Thats not the defining definition of whether or not they are good quarterbacks I think its just  trait of many that they have. Again hard to tell if its just luck or not but I think you cant write off the possibility of there being a clutch aspect that these quarterbacks have.

11785478,0,t1_dgvth01,Couldnt agree more. Mixon might be the only offensive player I actually want at  Cook is overrated. Id like Godwin or Zay Jones in the third but only if we went defense in the second and selected someone like Zach Cunningham Tyus Bowser Jordan Willis or Marcus Williams. ,Redskins,dgvx8ij,1,t5_2r4wc
11787079,0,t1_dgw364d,Yeah I hope so as well...I actually like the Smith pick ok as I think Preston could play inside even due to his length. This pick is hard sell for me though theres a lot of edge talent in the back of this draft. It is not a position of immediate need and the value or upside just isnt there at this spot. Andersons a good dude but its just a low ceiling pick no matter which way you slice it.,Redskins,dgw3s1v,3,t5_2r4wc
11788692,0,t1_dgw6t1w,I get your point but you know who else put up great Combine numbers?  Mike fucking Mamula.  So lets not automatically call him a bust before he play a single snap.,Redskins,dgwad96,8,t5_2r4wc
11789313,0,t1_dgwcq6e,Yeah its a bad pick. As long as hes on the roster I will keep reminding people hes a bad pick and people will tell me I need to give him a chance that it takes time to develop and blah blah blah. Then at some point he will get cut and I will win my beer bet. ,Redskins,dgwcwqf,1,t5_2r4wc
11794300,0,t1_dgwx0ee,Very polarizing guy. Some love him some as a Day  talent some think hes a th rounder. Great measureables workout warriors timid on the field. Clearly Coach Gray loved him and wants to coach him up think Obi Melifonwu lite. My concerns are hes a strong safety and not a free centerfielder and hes coming off of a shoulder surgery. ,Redskins,dgwx9ld,9,t5_2r4wc
11802823,0,t1_dgxhy82,Compared to those guys.  In two of the plays he was chased down by a lineman.  Let that sink in. Hes definitely got determination and keeps his legs moving.  Hes got some nasty cuts.  But in the nfl players wont miss all those tackles. Theyll be faster and hit much harder.  He wont be able to bounce off as much  and he doesnt seem to have the mass to keep pulling off his trucking in the nfl.Overall i think hes a solid situational runner but a backup for sure. ,Redskins,dgxw33z,3,t5_2r4wc
11809856,0,t1_dgynown,Fuck it. Just put stickem on his hands like that kid in Little Giants and make him a TE. Swear to God the defense will never see it coming. I can imagine Garretts face when he sees a  lb TE waving his arm in the back of the End Zone. Fuck yeah...,Redskins,dgyos8t,2,t5_2r4wc
