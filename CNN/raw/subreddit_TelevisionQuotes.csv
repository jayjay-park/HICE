257398,0,t3_1wzq9m,I hate to be the first one to comment this and ill probably be downvoted but it needs to be said.I can take a joke and all but every time I see or hear Meg make references about self harm it makes me feel ill because believe it or not this kind of publicity influences young selfharmers and offends those who suffer from it such as myself.Awareness about depression and selfharm is fine as long as it doesnt encourage or offend people. Lastly I have cut both across and longways it makes no difference. Suicide is rarely done and even more rarely successful when its done by cutting.Sorry to be the downer here but it needs to be said because jokes like these really affect people.,TelevisionQuotes,cf7forl,8,t5_2w18x

7397161,0,t1_d2j072q,Thats not what Im saying because thats a black and white statement. Its really not hard to have a more nuanced and fluid idea of what is and isnt ok. It all depends. E.g. If you used to be bulimic and youre making a cathartic joke about it to a friend thats fine. If youre making a meanspirited joke about bulimics infront of someone who is thats not fine.,TelevisionQuotes,d2j0bl3,10,t5_2w18x
