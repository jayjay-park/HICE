8108556,0,t3_4q2sbj,This is a really interesting survey and Im definitely curious about the outcome. I do think there is a large source of error in it. I personally dont play my games online or with other people. Its more a solitary thing for me. That reflects in my answers when asked about playing with other players and I believe it can misrepresent my life and playing style. This doesnt mean that I dislike the interaction or that Im lonely this is just one hobby that I like to do by myself. I believe including questions like Do you play online? remedy help this.,videogamescience,d4rh3e3,4,t5_3f13l

8213673,0,t3_4qvgel,I dont really believe Nintendo would reboot Pokemon so soon. One of the argument they gave for the pokemon bank having a fee was We wish to offer this service over the long term which means management and maintenance will be necessary to ensure that everyone can store their Pokmon online and that the service will be compatible with future Pokmon games. The annual fee will support this maintenance.A reboot would certainly means most if not every pokemons wouldnt be transferable to the new game which would defeat the purpose of the pokemon bank.,videogamescience,d549i0k,1,t5_3f13l

8724670,0,t3_4zcxnw,Something I found interesting was how Nintendo reused things to speed development time.They reused the engine and models from OOT but they also reused a lot of things in the game too. When youre flipping the dungeon upside down its like youre doubling the size of the dungeon  getting twice the gameplay out of the same number of models.Also traveling back in time with additional knowledge and items forces you to retrack through the same areas multiple times  again reusing previous models. But with those additional skills and items each area takes on a whole new context.This is a really interesting example of how a shortened development cycle can produce a very different but still high quality gaming experience.,videogamescience,d6w84mo,3,t5_3f13l

But then you either make your whole game based on a cookie clickerlike progression system or develop a real interesting mechanic and use that to make the people feel like theyve accomplished something.,videogamescience,d8zy7fz,2,t5_3f13l
9341396,0,t3_58fakc,It would be impossible if the FEV replaced large amounts of DNA you couldnt turn them back to exactly how they were. However if it simply turned off some original sections and injected new ones that would be relatively easy to perfectly fix. Youd just use a similar DNAediting virus and that technology must exist because the FEV uses it.I think the worst expected case is a number of isolated identifiable direct modifications overwriting old DNA code. Extremely large amounts of rewriting isnt very probable because the subjects still look almost entirely human really. Possible solutions Maybe the FEV cant achieve  saturation  for example a persons own immune system cannot access the inside of their eyeballs. Find untouched DNA and proceed with genetic rollback. For many subjects it may be possible to dig around in the original vaults they were kidnapped from and lift some old DNA from the beds brushes whatever. Alternatively use donated DNA  hopefully someone that was at least like their original appearance. They wouldnt be the same but at least theyd be human again.,videogamescience,d90388a,2,t5_3f13l
9944971,0,t1_db3tgoa,Ill answer your questions but bear with me because I am on my phone haha Trion is not the developer just a publisher. The game had great potential but they fucked up the release by not having the server capacity to handle the amount of players. The servers were very unstable at launch and they had a few rollbacks I believe. The player base was generally unhappy with how Trion was handling consumer complaints and their apparent lack of PR. They must see a drop in active players because they keep having to do things to keep people coming back. One of my main problems with the Archeage economy is that there is no shortage of gold. And that issue is increased when they release sellable items in their cash shop. The RNG boxes in the cash shop along with the ability to sell almost things bought with real money in the auction house helped the economy to become the mess that it was. I understand in the new servers released  days ago that they removed about  pages of pay to win items from the shop though. The game has elements of fighting trading and farming. It doesnt do any of these in a noteworthy fashion but it does have them and they work together well. You farm the materials and then trade them and can be attacked while trading them. Or you can do any of the  individually sell the mats buy the mats offer protection for payment.  I remember a lot of people working on set schedules for things like halcy runs and stuff. I guess it did kind of routinize you pretty heavily but so do most MMOs.  You didnt put a ... For this question Im going to tell you my favourite thing that ever happened while playing archeage. I was in a very large guild that headed a council of other very large guilds. We all shared one team speak channel to allow for fast communication. We had organized a large trade run to freedich isle and when we arrived there we were attacked by an opposing alliance. The amount of coordination that got done in that instant was so much fun. Myself and the other officers immediately started jumping to the other guilds channels and got a secondary attack force together. The second force was huge and it was ready to go and attacking the enemy in minutes. The fight lasted at least an hour probably closer to  or . We lost a lot of trade packs and a few ships but it was so much fun we talked about it for days after. So I would say thats where the fun was for me not the actual fight the camaraderie of the guilds and their members. But thats just me and Im kind of weird about games lol I cant answer this truthfully I havent played in in about a year. But the game definitely seemed like a cash grab when it was released in America originally. There was no communication from Trion and there was so much pay to win that it almost seemed like if you werent dumping money there was no reason to play. I cant speak on the state of the actual game right now but I can say for sure that they just keep releasing fresh start servers and that looks like they dont know how to manage what they already have when it comes to the late game. It feels like they just keep restarting and hoping no one notices that they cant maintain the economies or whatever. if I remember correctly its very exponential. But again I dont know what theyve changed since I played last. You cant remove it. There is a PW aspect to the game that is basically built in. But Trion looks like they are trying to. There are better ways to put a catchup mechanic in place than charging for them many other games have done it successfully. I hope this has helped.,videogamescience,db3urnh,2,t5_3f13l

11399687,0,t1_dfo3t53,Im honestly not a huge fan of Zelda as a franchise. Theyre good games but they dont really stand out to me. Ocarina is actually one of my least favorite egoraptor is spot on about how its combat is waitingcentric.I actually think its nice to have enemies that do more than a half of a heart of damage for once  ALL previous Zeldas are cakewalks and this one at least tries to challenge you. You can tell its the first challenging Zelda by how scattered the developers attempts are at balancing it. Shield parry counter rush absurd amount of healing items food that makes you do more damage food that makes you take less damage food that gives you temporary hearts over your max and tons of environmentalelemental factors all attempt to mitigate the oneshot aspect of about half the games combat. The thing that drives me nuts is how this game tries to work against its own challenge. Stronger enemies require you to break weapons which discourages you from engaging. Beating bosses weakens Gannon. That sort of thing. There is one power that helps with climbing but again it comes from one of the main dungeons so if you get it Ganon loses a form and a chunk of his health. Even that is not a substitute for a hookshot. I think it would have been better if the map was much less mountainous and you were on a timer. Make it  ingame days or something. Say that Zeldas seal on Ganon is weakening and after the two months are up he will be at full power. As the days pass his HP increases and he gains a form or two. Now theres kind of a balance between rushing in with weaker gear and spending time to help the people of Hyrule while gearing up for an epic battle. Have the ending reflect what you did in those  days. Kakariko village is saveddestroyed certain characters might aid you in the final battle etc. It would feel much more focused and dynamic and it would be worth playing through multiple times to try different strategies. Much better than hunting down recipes for mushroom souffl or whatever. ,videogamescience,dfo51va,1,t5_3f13l
