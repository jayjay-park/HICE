3354171,0,t3_2ylcvi,This is a project I did with a couple of my friends one weekend actually over new years eve. We threw together some stuff to see what would happen just for fun really. I know these songs are hardly professional quality and these will probably never get an official release. Making these songs were more about the process. My friend had the house to himself one weekend so he invited all of us to come over and bring all our instruments to hang out and play music. For those interested in gear these songs were recorded completely with analog equipment using a tape machine my friend had and an analog sound board he borrowed from his job. Working with tape is way different from recording as we know it now it shaped how our whole process went. Instead of having control of pretty much everything in post you pretty much cant edit tape. If we wanted to remix anything we had to record the entire song over again. In the second song the intro is a lot longer than planned because I the bass player started playing a riff we were jamming over earlier instead of the riff to the entire song and once I figured out what happened I awkwardly transitioned to the right riff. The rest of the take was fine and we really didnt want to play it again so we just kept it. Thanks for giving this a listen to be honest I dont know how enjoyable these songs will be to other people. It was a great time making them though I think sometimes thats what matters.,letmehear,cpalm88,2,t5_37ckg
