204788,0,t3_1wg6xm,Have you listened to any WuTang? They make some of the best and most accessible hip hop out there. Theyre a great starting point for a hiphop novice. Check these outEnter the WuTang  Chambers   This is their first album as a group. Its a classic that any aspiring head should check out. Its a little dated nowadays but it still sounds incredible to me. They made this album with pretty much no money RZA produced the whole thing and he did it right. Liquid Swords  This is a solo album from GZA but the rest of the clan makes appearances. If youre into lyrics this is the one for you. GZA is super thoughtful on this record. RZAs production is a lot more refined than on their debut you can tell he learned a lot and really knew how to make beats that showed off GZAs particular style. Only Built  Cuban Linx...  This is Raekwons solo album. If you like mafia rap and story telling in your hip hop youll love this. The whole thing is one long gangster movie delivered in Raekwons exceptionally smooth and honed style. ,hiphop101,cf1rp6m,4,t5_2t014

While Im sure they smoked on occasion these  were extremely focused on their craft so theyre not exactly huge potheads like we might think at least about Dre. Dre especially had a real old school mentality at first coming from a fairly clean funk heavy group just before meeting Eazy.It really wasnt the cool thing for rappers to praise weed smoking so much until The Chronic,hiphop101,cu5f5tw,12,t5_2t014

In any event even if you say N.W.A was the start of gangsta rap with  and Straight Outta Compton that wasnt that mainstream it didnt go platinum until  Even their real debut N.W.A. and the Posse only went gold in .

10001024,0,t3_5imfhi,This is hard to answer. Rap is diverse and deeeeeep! Ive been a fan from the start. I used to record cassette tapes off late night public radio djs spinning rap and take them to school in the s. I love rap of all styles and eras. I also really loved metal growing up since it also found its stride in the s. Love the classics. I love Pink Floyd and Zeppelin. Having said all that.. what style rap would I suggest? Who knows lol. I grew up on the west coast so for me gangsta rap and the gfunk era really speak to me and my experiences growing up but to some they cant get passed the violence to enjoy it.Rap was born in NY and didnt find its own identity on the west coast right away. One of the groups that changed that was NWA Specifically for me I was always impressed with Ice Cube. He is a masterful story teller. He eventually split from the group and went to the east coast to work with the Bomb Squad which were the production crew for Public Enemy. I remember my  year old self thinking he had the biggest balls ever for going to the east coast on his first solo album. He did and its one of hip hops most respected albums whether you like gangsta rap or not. Ice Cubes solo album was AmeriKKKas Most Wanted I also remember my  year old self having to rewind my cassette walkman over and over to fully hear the knowledge Ice Cube was dropping.So here is an example.  Take the song What They Hittin Foe Ice Cube takes you front row to a dice game in the hood. The song is one minute and  seconds long and when you read the lyrics and hear what he is dropping I feel his skills are undeniable even if you dont like what he is saying. gtFucking around in a crap gamegtNiggas think Im soft cause now Im in the rap gamegtAnd I dont hang out as much bang out dope cutsgtStanding on stage and Im grabbing my nutsgtBut when it comes to getting in a circlegtIm hitting sevens turning broke niggas purplegtLooking for Little Joe and the dough nigga scream and chokegtWhen deucedeuce hit the floor yogtNow which of ya wanna fade the twenty?gtIm turning your fat pockets skinnygtAh yeah Im shaking the ivorygtAnd boom its like they die for megtFool you can get loud get mad hit the jointgtBut dont forget my pointgtThere it is yogtI put my Nike on the bet so it wont slidegtMoney gone cause Im never hitting deucefivegtIm never hitting fourtrey no waygtYou wanna leave but come on ho staygtNigga fever thatll workgtPoppa need brandnew shoes and a sweatshirtgtFool you cant even fuck with thatgtAnd now that Im winning I gots to get my gatgtCause I see your homies starting to lookgtAnd broke motherfuckers they make the best crooksgtAnd Im feeling like a ballergtBucking fools now the circles getting smallergtNow you wanna go and schemegtPunk niggas like you just love to tripleteamgtSo I pick up my money and start walkinggtCause now I let the gat start talkinggtNow since yall lost you wanna go out like a suckergtTake that motherfuckersAs far as rap that I feel is must hear to fully appreciate the genre.East coast artists  KRSONE Rakim Big Daddy Kane Kool G Rap Gangstarr Wu Tang Clan EPMD Mos Def Black Star Notorious BIG Nas Big L A Tribe Called Quest Busta Rhymes Redman and Method Man RunDMC . I could go on for days and I missed a ton.West coast artists  Ice Cube The DOC he was from Dallas but Dre!

So much rap in  and beyond. Inspectah Deck of Wu Tang Clan dropped a new album this year at  years old with the group Czarface and he slays. Even if our tastes differ I hope the info and examples get you started on your hiphop journey! gl hfSome clips that showcase rap. Oddly this first clip is a commercial but it has  of the GOATs DJ Premier Rakim Nas and KRSONE in one track and its a classic! Busta Rhymes busting raps on a morning radio show. You can see how infectious his joy becomes.   GOATs inspiring each other Nas raps .. Im not telling you. Just watch it P The most respected song in rap. Even the GOATs go dayyummm. Skillz The song is edited but the video makes up for it. Honest Expression Mos Def slays Blast Master KRSONE The Teacha The Rap GodI apologize if my grammar is horrible if Im honest I was always ditching English to listen to rap with friends PTLDR  KRSONE is masterful. Rap comes in many flavors just like rock so you might need to try some stuff to find what speaks to you. Also real rap is alive and thriving in  dont listen to those regurgitating ass fronting rap fans that just dont know heheEDIT Format thangs,hiphop101,dbb5ubn,3,t5_2t014
