When the leather gets a dusty or dont look its  always a good idea to condition with something there is no way to repair leather once its cracked and dry leather will crack.  Also cleaning it even with an approved cleanser will remove some of the oils from the leather. ,Birkenstocks,dei7hgn,2,t5_2uf7o
