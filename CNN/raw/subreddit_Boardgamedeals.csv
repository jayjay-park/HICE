I picked up a copy of Sheriff of Nottingham and the register wasnt reducing the discounted price. I asked about the discount because it did have the sticker. The manager was behind all of the cashiers and looked surprised and asked me where I got the game. I said the board game section duh. He left to go look at the section after entering the  discount. I went to BampN on December  and all the  stickers were gone. I dont think any of it was meant to go on sale,Boardgamedeals,cye1cef,1,t5_2yq92
