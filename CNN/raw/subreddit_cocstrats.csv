1200593,0,t3_27s5s1,Thanks for the article I have added it to my reading list.As a TH also I am using BARCH almost exclusively albeit with  wb and  giants.I find I can get to Gold  easily and even touched into crystal for the gem bonus a season ago. However staying there and trying to find bases to attack was more difficult.As my clan is on a push again and I am sitting at G I will see if I can reach into midcrystal with this guide and keep you posted,cocstrats,ci4oo4q,1,t5_324a9
