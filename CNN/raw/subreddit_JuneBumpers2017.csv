9845400,0,t3_5gb8rs,I dont have any advice because Im not someone who is bothered by blood tests sorry! But in terms of the gender blood test that is a separate optional test known as NIPT noninvasive prenatal testing where they take a sample of your blood which has tiny amounts of the babys DNA circulating in it. So they can test parts of the babys genome by looking for chromosomal problems. Looking at chromosomes by definition means knowing the gender so the blood work tells you if the babe has a Y chromosome aka is a boy or not! ,JuneBumpers2017,daqvn0t,1,t5_3gtu0

10008735,0,t3_5iqh3i,Honestly Ive distanced myself. Pregnancy has turned me into an introvert and I just want to be home most of the time.

In my first trimester I was sick most of the time and we hadnt told anyone our news yet. Now Im  weeks and have more energy but am still perfectly happy to spend my evenings and days off at home or running errands on my own. Its weird. My advice is for you to reach out to them if youre feeling up to hanging out. They probably assumed you were wanting to be taking it easy and also life gets distracting and people tend to be focused on their own stuff so dont take it personally. Reach out to the and schedule something or at least get back in touch. ,JuneBumpers2017,dbc60n1,2,t5_3gtu0

10457575,0,t1_dctg927,Yes. We would terminate the pregnancy. My husband and I had discussed this and we were in total  agreement. I work in education and so have actually seen people with developmental disabilities and worked with them on a day to day basis and let me tell you there was nothing more depressing to me than a life skills classroom. My husband and I are both intellectually gifted and so we are just not the right parents for that kind of child. Additionally there are many people with DS who never learn to walk always use diapers etc etc. One thing people dont tell you is that the vast majority of marriages among people with disabled children end in divorce. It is too stressful on the marriage. Additionally you are raising that child for the rest of your life. When you die what happens? It is a huge burden on the rest of the family. There is no escape from the financial health costs which are astronomical and in this climate where we are eliminating the ACA we would likely be paying out of pocket for the vast majority of expenses. One other thing to think about  people with DS have dramatically shorter life spans and about half get alzheimers in their s if they live that long. Overall we just could not bring ourselves to parent in that way. I had heard that deciding whether to terminate a DS pregnancy would be like being asked to cut off your right hand or your left. Obviously you choose the non dominant hand. But you still lose a hand. It sucks but the only blessing was that we werent lost we had a plan of action. It was just coming to terms with the results if they were truly positive that was a problem. Before the pregnancy we had said of course well terminate and during the pregnancy we were still set on that course of action. But then thinking through what a late term abortion was going to entail what it would be like to bury our son to put him in a box wrapped in his blankie in the ground so he wouldnt be cold and he would know that mommy and daddy love him... bringing him flowers on his due date..... it was heartbreaking. But to us a more imaginable future than raising him that way. I never thought I would be confronted with those thoughts either. But we were. Pregnancy is a hope not a promise. ,JuneBumpers2017,dctgyqo,4,t5_3gtu0
