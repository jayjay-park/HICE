5254010,0,t1_cvit8rp,According to Wargaming they have removed all modifiers from account ave exp calculations except premium time. That is daily bonuses flags and possibly any other bonuses that I cant think of right now no longer factor into the calculations on the official website stat page only premium time bonus does.Now Im not sure why the API wasnt changed to reflect this since Warshipstats is still using the previous formula. Wasnt there a sudden jump in ave exp a month or so ago when they moved to the allinclusive formula? So now theres a sudden drop when they move back... Except Warshipstats isnt reflecting that drop.,Warshipstats,cvjaojs,2,t5_393fi
