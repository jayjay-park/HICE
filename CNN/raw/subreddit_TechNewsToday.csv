It is named after Ian Betteridge a British technology journalist  although the general concept is much older.  The observation has also been called Davis law   or just the journalistic principle. gtBetteridge explained the concept in a February  article regarding a TechCrunch article with the headline Did Last.fm Just Hand Over User Listening Data To the RIAA?gtgtThis story is a great demonstration of my maxim that any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no. The reason why journalists use that style of headline is that they know the story is probably bullshit and dont actually have the sources and facts to back it up but still want to run it. gtInteresting Sensationalism | List of eponymous laws | Sport in Birmingham Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcguqcfw oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecguqcfw.

School districts are independent government entities so if you fail to pay your property taxes either the county or the school district can sue you. Zynga has an office here in north Austin that falls within the Round Rock Independent School District so does Dell.  We have two kinds of property taxes businesses must pay  one is on the actual property  not applicable because Zynga just rents.  However there is also Business Personal Property  computers chairs coffee machines etc  that is taxable.  ,TechNewsToday,chbi6bc,3,t5_2sjnq
