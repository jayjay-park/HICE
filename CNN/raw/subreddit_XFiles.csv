417477,0,t3_1yu0xj,the first season is solid tv. The pilot is great and episodes like Squeeze and Tooms are also really good. Beyond the Sea from season  is phenominal. I like the first season but it also has some flaws it imo gets a little repetitive in the second half and the episodes Ghost in the Machine and Space are truly awful episodes with no redeemable moments. Seriously I almost quit watching after Space. The first season at times can be a little slow.Season  is good the mythology episodes this season are great and the episode Humbug introduces a comedy element into the show.Season  is really great and is when I think the show really starts to hit its stride Clyde Bruckmans Final Repose is one of the best episodes of tv. I have ever seen.seasons  are generally amazing great episode after great episode and some of the most memorable stories in tv history.season  is really good too it has a different feel than the first  seasons its pretty light hearted and is filmed in CA But it has some of my favorite episodes of Tv.season  is tired its not terrible and there are a handful of good episodes yet it seems kind of worn out. Like their phoning it in. Overall pretty mehseason  is very weird its like a different show. There are some good episodes but theres something not right about it and its just not that good.season  is pretty bad only a few episodes I liked and they werent that good anyway BUT it is still worth a watching the show seasons  are some of the best seasons of television.,XFiles,cfo1cu8,3,t5_2rtyt

The kid from Conduit plays another more ambiguously evil black haired kid in I think its a season  episode has amish people or something in it.One of the detectives who harshes on Mulder in Squeeze plays Tony Shaloubs colleague in Soft Light.

3982074,0,t1_cr966bf,Me too. Except that Im nowhere near that week so I cant even blame hormones. Im just overly emotional where this is all concerned. When I first fell in love with the show I used to wish it was a person so I could marry it because I loved it so much. I eventually realized how popular the show was and that if it was a person it could choose from any number of people and probably wouldnt want me and I would turn into a crazy stalker and The XFiles would have to get a restraining order against me and then Id end up in jail because I wouldnt be able to leave it alone...I really like this show.,XFiles,cra6wgc,3,t5_2rtyt

4726106,0,t1_ctoztxa,Dont blame the Internet its just the expectation for modern shows and is perhaps confusing to people watching a s show for the first time. XFiles did a mix of mytharcMOTW. Shortly after the show Lost started and it also sort of did the mix but it tended more heavily towards the mytharc episodes especially as the show progressed with fewer that were standalones. And if you consider some of the most popular and acclaimed shows of the recent years  Breaking Bad True Detective Hannibal Game of Thrones House of Cards and others  they tend to tell a single large story or a story per season and have few episodes that dont affect that story. So the structure of the XFiles might seem unusual to someone whos watched mainly shows from the last decade or so.,XFiles,ctq9kvj,3,t5_2rtyt

4775731,0,t3_3gabie,When she does get a good scene for example the bit with the lawyer in John Doe  Please dont speak Spanish anymore shes a great character but she didnt get enough good scenes and she was extremely lacking in character development which was really noticeable because she was sharing a season with Doggett and Scully and a show with Mulder. The whole psychic thing felt like something that would be given to a oneshot character not a main character and was then ignored anyway.Honestly I find it more sad then anything because the character had potential and didnt live up to it.,XFiles,ctwiune,6,t5_2rtyt
4795326,0,t3_3gabie,Im a complete loner in that I was an original fan yet completely loved Doggett and Reyes from very early on. Reyes was a little difficult at first because I think even though the whole psychic thing is a bit of a joke she came off a bit serious and stiff as did Doggett. As time went on I think they became a brilliant and fun pairing Sunshine Days is a great example of this. As others have said I think you need to think of them as their own characters and not as replacements but I appreciate it is very difficult. Of all the series Ive been into with big character changes ER for example D amp R are the only ones Ive really taken to so I do know its not always easy to warm to new characters. ,XFiles,ctyzn8e,3,t5_2rtyt

The genie story is the same as every fairytale theres a genie or three wishes in the first wish not carefully worded the second one that you use to revert the first the third that becomes so dangerous. In a lot of episodes the scenarists used old stories and made them a bit different. For example the plot in the Big Blue story is pretty simple unknown monster in lake. But there is an ambiguity the whole episode is it real or not and its both in a way and we have a very memorable moment on the desert island. Here in Je souhaite we have an old story where the place and time and names are changed and voila. I found it at the same time annoying and infuriating I felt I had been robbed of a good episode by lazy fuckers.

6310145,0,t3_41wztn,Number Favorite episode PostModern Prometheus. Theres so many great works in this series yet without fail I always circle back to this episode as my personal favorite. Whats not to love? the film noir reminiscence the great MulderScully chemistry the bizarre MOTW its all beautifully done and then the ending just hits you with pure elation. I dont know if its because Walking in Memphis was such a treasured song of my youth or because it was simply a fitting addition to the Cherthemed episode but watching a gleeful sheltered Frankensteinlike Cher Fanboy get his ultimate wish while Mulder and Scully share a dance... its a moment Ill never forget. ,XFiles,cz6w5j0,1,t5_2rtyt

Chris needs this alot more than either GA or DD doalso btw DDs net worth is more than double GAs and more than  higher than CCs not because he found it on the ground but because hes been in more successful projects. IF he was offered more its because he has a better track record of delivering hits to the network or studio he works for. ,XFiles,cz8cv4z,-2,t5_2rtyt

6550218,0,t3_45b5hj,... I actually thought that Scully looked TOO good in the current episodes because I doubt a female FBI agent out in the field dresses like this. Anderson was already hot during the s but she was dressed formal and not exposing her body by tight clothing like now. This makes the current episodes more artificial looking because Scully appears more like a poster girl and not like a real agent. It hurts the credibility of the show.,XFiles,czwuhdc,-4,t5_2rtyt

One of the most crushing entertainment disappointments in my entire life down there with Phantom Menace Crystal Skull and the remake of The Prisoner.The problem isnt that its not much different than it was o years ago its that its doing it LESS WELL. The dialog is clunky the editing REALLY choppy and the performances selfregarding and tongue in cheek though props to Anderson who does at least seem to be trying at times. People who think its any good I wish I could fool myself as you are. I would LOVE to be enjoying it. But I cant. Its terrible. ,XFiles,d02ea7m,15,t5_2rtyt

6606447,0,t1_d02n8qe,Honestly I cant name five episodes I absolutely hate. I mean even First Person Shooter or X Cops has its funny moments. A show that ran for  episodes spawned  feature films and is now returning to TV after a long absence might have a few clunkers. I mean to expect greatness with every scene is being selfish and unrealistic. The one thing Im kinda bummed about is people bashing Chris Carter if an episode doesnt live up to their expectations.  Like I  remember after Mulder and Scully Meet the Weremonster people in the subreddit and other places were like  What a shit episode. Chris Carter cant write for shit The guy brought our show back for us. I mean he didnt need to and after the last movie I half expected it to never come back. But it did and so what if it isnt blowing your socks off like Bad Blood or the mythology isnt Gethsemane.  Its still the XFiles its still amazing.

I think season  was quite horror heavy  and dont get me wrong Fire was pretty creepy and tense as were all the episodes  but I think Fire made for a nice style break midway through the season. A lot of the other episodes relied on typical nighttime dark sets whereas Fire was almost entirely out in the open daylight. This kinda detracted from the horror effect but at the same time it was a reminder that no one is safe in Xfiles daytime or night time! Great episode. ,XFiles,d79p4cr,3,t5_2rtyt

8901509,0,t3_524sen,I am . The XFiles still remains my all time favorite show ever since I was . I still remember begging my mom to take me to the video store to rent out all the VHS tapes they had with  episodes it. Ice was one of them and to this day its probably my favorite MOTW episode. I think I wore that tape out from watching it so much. This was after I caught Roadrunners on late night TNT when browsing through the channels. I was hooked and spent that entire summer recording every episode I could and watching them. Thanks to TNT and them showing like hrs of eps every night I was able to watch the whole show over the summer by recording them on blank VHSes going to sleep and waking up to binge watch them. I even had a tape I recorded with a run of great episodes from season  and I used to fall asleep with this playing on my TV in the background like every night... Crazy that this was over  years ago. I can vividly remember myself staying up past my bedtime and watching my recorded tapes on my small little TV under a blanket. Even crazier when I remember that this show is nearly as old as me. I watch a lot of TV and I consider XF my first TV show obsession. And even now a decade later I still consider it my  show. Sorry for the tangent. But thinking on the show really gives me a nostalgia rush and brings back good memories. Love this show dearly. Even today I cant think of a another show that even holds a candle to the chemistry and on screen presence that Gillian and David had. ,XFiles,d7hu0qr,12,t5_2rtyt
8991830,0,t1_d7qctfx,I like to think that the series ended shortly before the Closure parter in season . End the show there and Ill accept things. The show massively collapsed in seasons  and  but it actually had started even before then.,XFiles,d7sogtw,-1,t5_2rtyt

9089370,0,t3_54rk53,Well there are many who are grounded  in science just like Scully. So if she sees anything that defies science she always figures out a way to explain it scientifically in her mind. Even if that explanation is thin. She also loses her memory quite a few times in the series especially times where she has seen a UFO up close. But I agree she drives me nuts sometimes too. But that is what makes the show you have one skeptic and one believer. If they were both skeptics andor believers it wouldnt be the same show.,XFiles,d84e948,7,t5_2rtyt

10194710,0,t1_dbzfomg,interesting thanks for posting this.. Im a pretty big x files fan and have seen every episode countless times but I have always been kind of lost and confused on the mythology episodes. Part of it is because I mainly like the monster of the week episodes and although Ive seen them all quite a few times Ive never really paid tons of attention to the mythology ones.. That gives me an idea Im going to go binge all the mythology episodes this weekend lol I love thinking of new reasons to keep watching x files ,XFiles,dbzmk6w,1,t5_2rtyt
10220052,0,t1_dbwqkt2,Shes also pretty happy when they found the invisible body  tho it got lost later.VanBlunt also made her a bit happy. Can we make a list of things that made Scully smile? Probably just a few episode. The pilot may be one of them when Mulder tells her they will go to Oregon early in the morning.,XFiles,dc2i0we,1,t5_2rtyt

10720951,0,t1_ddlciro,While I do think XCops is pretty funny Id definitely cast my vote for Bad Blood. Thats the one I always put on if someone wants to watch an episode without any commitment and it always gets laughs.Actually sort of lends itself to rewatches too. Something I only just noticed on a recent rewatch was when Mulder to the Sheriff explains how vampires have to pick up seeds he drops some in the car and the Sheriff proceeds to pick themspoilers. Im sure other people spotted that right away but I only just noticed.,XFiles,ddlsc43,1,t5_2rtyt

11196463,0,t3_5zoe9j,Its not so much that it doesnt make sense but more like certain aspects are never resolved andor are replaced by other stuff.Take the black oil for example. The centerpiece of the mythology from seasons to. After Fight the Future it feels like things are about to kick into even higher gear regarding the black oil... but we never hear or see anything about it until Vienen. A fun romp of an episode in season  but despite the presence of the Black Oil it truly is more of a standalone episode than a mythology episode. They grey aliens are kinda shoved aside after season  and replaced by the replicantssupersoldiers. Its never  clear if the replicants are supposed to be a different race of aliens or one of several human experiments like the alienhuman hybrids to combat the aliens. In one episode theyd be one thing and in the following episode theyd be the opposite. Same goes for their goal and motivations.I dont even want to delve into what was Mulder and Scullys baby supposed to be. One episode it was a threat to the aliens another episode it was a threat for humanity another episode he was the key to save humanity in some other episode he was human but also alien then neither. Then the writers gave up so they had Scully give it up. Then theres the thing that Carter and Spotnitz had to play with the hand they had been dealt with. After season  the original plan apparently was to have Krycek and Covarrubias spearhead a new Syndicate of sorts but they couldnt lock Laurie Holden to return that season so they had to come up with something else. Fox kept renewing the show even when the original intention was for it to last only  years. Duchovny wanting out. I love to blame Carter and Spotnitz for not planning ahead but they also had to deal with a few things that were out of their control.There are no excuses for how poorly thought out the event series was. Okay lets accept for a second that UFOs and the grey aliens are a fabrication by the very human conspirators to confuse people... but what about the black oil? The shapeshifting bounty hunters? Those stupid super soldiers? How are those lies too?I just wonder if Chris Carter knows what will happen in the first episode of a theoretical season  after such a cliffhanger. ,XFiles,df13t8n,1,t5_2rtyt
11245069,0,t1_df46ts8,Mulders arm was injured so she probably offered packing to help him avoid the pain and further injure. Scully is nice like that.,XFiles,df6m1bb,3,t5_2rtyt
11291730,0,t1_dfag3gg,I also always forget about Phoebe. Maybe because the chemistry between Mulder and her was not convincing. What I liked was the fact that she gave us an insight on Mulders feelings. The episode showed that he had an issue with letting go and that also his heart was broken. Opposite to Scully who seemed to be the one who breaks hearts  possibly also her own who knows. What I also liked was the analogy between the guy who makes things burn and playing with fire in a sexual way. Mulder plays with the fire impersonated by Phoebe. Thats also why we all hate her including Mulder who is having a phobia against fire we only discover it in that episode and not in the pilot when the motel was burning but never mind but tho he play with it slash her. So he is drawn to people that actually scare him.I like how he lets Scully know about his feelings. I think their deep friendship is shown in such a nice way in that episode.I saw some parallels too towards Bambi. She had a thing for bug and Mulder tells Scully on the phone that he hates bugs. So as much as he is fascinated by Bambi he just cant be into her as much because he doesnt share her passion.Thats what draws him to Scully they share their passion or lets say they are able to relate to the others passion. ,XFiles,dfbwgis,2,t5_2rtyt
