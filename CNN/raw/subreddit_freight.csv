10948498,0,t3_5wdodt,Im applying for a job with a tech company to run their shipping department. A friend of mine helped start this company and when the position opened he approached me about applying for it. He knows Im responsible and a hard worker and he thinks my personality would fit with the people there. The guy in charge of hiring is reluctant because I dont have experience shipping freight. I do manage shipping at my current job but its small packages that I process through UPS. Anyone have any advice for me about what I should know going in for the interview? I would love to land this job because its a good company the hours are normal it pays well and offers decent benefits which I havent had in  years. Any advice tips knowledge etc. would be greatly appreciated.,freight,de99dey,1,t5_2qzgi
