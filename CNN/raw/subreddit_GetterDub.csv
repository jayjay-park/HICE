6485749,0,t1_czq6a1w,gtAphex Twin  Mt Saint Michel  Saint Michaels Mount p HDHQ gtgtDrukqs is the fifth studio album released by Richard D. James under his Aphex Twin alias. While being a great album it is also an odd mixture of piano compositions mixed in with complex acid covered Breakcore and DnB. Its always been rumored that Richard intended this album to be a contract breaker with Warp Records. Either way it has some great tracks so enjoy  gt YarbTheLegend in Musicgt views since Jul bot info,GetterDub,czq6an5,1,t5_3ayu7
