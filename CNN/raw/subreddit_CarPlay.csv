7209143,0,t1_d1wj20v,CarPlay IS prime time now. Walk into an Audi or VW dealership. They have posters all over the place advertising CarPlay and Android Auto. IMHO . everything works great but there are still some loose ends. We should do our best to complain if we do spot bugs because Apple is pushing CarPlay pretty hard with a number of newer cars. Its no longer a novelty that is only available to early adopters with aftermarket desks. Its being marketed as a completed experience.  ,CarPlay,d1xmfr1,1,t5_30p7d

9306424,0,t3_5726uk,I found out that there is a bug with the Recents list. You must navigate back to the Home screen then reselect the Recent list to refresh it. Otherwise if you just stop a stream and pick another from the list you will get a station that was in that position on the list previously.,CarPlay,d8vnn4e,1,t5_30p7d

9931111,0,t1_db1xg8b,Really great unit. The CarPlay part is fantastic compared to any previous car  phone  media interface I have experienced.   The Sony part at the root of the unit is good visually unoffensive and works. I will only really use this part for the settings and the tuner. Visually they could of done better with the tuner but at least it is not one of these Panasonic displays that feels like it is left over from the s.   Very responsive CarPlay interface. Siri works great. There is something a little weird about having a unit that has two interfaces. So youve got three main buttons that you are dealing with the Sony home button which takes you back to the root Sony display with access to the settings and tuner  plus USB and backup camera the volume knob that works as both a Siri activator and a peek window for some Sony options  like the control panel in iOS and then there is the virtual home button on screen that acts like the home button on your phone.  This three button interface where they all do similar things is the kind of thing you know Apple avoids. In a week it wont matter as I will stop pushing the home button thinking that it will take me back to the root home screen of CarPlay etc but you wish there was a Apple aftermarket unit. I had mine installed in a  Honda Fit. I replaced the factory speakers as well. The sound is very good and an improvement on the factory set up.  If it was a bigger car Id install an amp and a sub but this car is too small. There was some mild buggy behavior when I was rearranging the icons which you have to do on the phone in the settings but beyond that nothing. The interface is surprisingly quick and Siri has been solid. Its not cheap but it has massively improved my commute. ,CarPlay,db21roc,3,t5_30p7d
