It would have the time remaining text in red in the center of the icon until it was safe to recast without losing ticks and then the text would change to Yellow.The other thing would be an icon for Shards of nothing that showed the remaining time while the buff was active text in yellow please then swapped to the internal cooldown when the buff faded text in red please.My last one would be a demonic fury bar with just text for the current Fury in it.

For instance Natures Vigil for first add spawn trinket using shard of nothing atm. for nd add spawn and tree of lifeNatures Vigil for rd add spawn. Tranq during transition when you stack to AoE adds.The fight is so long and there is pretty long between meaningful mechanics that require cooldown usage so you should be able to get at least  cycles off maybe except tranq.Also make sure to track Harmony and make it priority number one.

3167264,0,t3_2wf7pu,Well as a DPs player myself more specifically a Demo Warlock I find it very frustrating when my RL and other members of the raid critique me having no knowledge of the class at all. Its not always as easy as just comparing numbers to other logs or guilds. You want to ensure your DPS are doing effective DPS and not just padding meters. Check pot usage to ensure that they are prepotting and then potting during the fight. Thats a quick tell tale of slack or poor DPS. We have a few in our raid and its frustrating.your warlock looks to be pretty good. Granted he has a high ilvl his DPS will drop from next week when Demonbolt nerfs come in he might actually have to spend a week readjusting to what will most likely be a new rotation again. I think you could be taking on too much work trying to understand every class and then fine picking each player they should be doing this self critique themselves. Id say its better served addressing obviously low DPS. Your rogue Leeks your Balance Druid energeticand your frost DK Sarkast stand out to me as being a bit low but that might be ilvl related?  I know in our raid rogues mages and balance druids are battling out for top spot every fight with Rogue and balance druids doing really well on the aoecleave fights.

3348828,0,t1_cp9hdid,Those are excellent points with regard to the solid colors rather than icons. I have a couple spells wild growth and wild mushroom but there was really no reason for choosing icons other than I thought having a bunch of colors would get confusing. Definitely something I should look into because theres definitely room to improve in that area. Answering your questions. The borders around my frames are status borders. Blue  dispellable debuff Red  Aggro. I dont track Tranq or Tree of Life. The reason being is as follows. One of the first things I do when approaching a new fight is map out exactly where to use those cooldowns. Its easy when theyre needed at a particular point but it gets interesting when theyre not needed and I instead need to find the optimal spots for mana theyre stupid efficient heals even if theyre not needed or convenience purposes. In either case I try to maximize the number of uses of each cd I can get in a fight while using them at optimal times. Then I always cast those spells at those times like if they were part of the mechanics of a fight. In essence I dont really need to track those cooldowns because theyre planned out and shouldnt be used outside of my plan. This of course only works when the raid has figured out a fight and emergencies are very unlikelyshould no longer happen. They just show a countdown on the icon.. Yes Lifebloom wild mushroom and harmony all play a sound on expiration. Its a  british female  because I like feeling like James Bond voice that says the name of the spell that expired. I need to figure out the best way to share those sounds along with explanation for installation.

3434858,0,t3_2zijvf,I know you came for Holy Paladin guidance and sometimes it feels like as a healer you can fix things  but your raid leader is to blame for some things as well.  Including allowing an Affliction Warlock to be at .k DPS for a  minute fight.  Dude could be easily doing k if he swapped to Demonology.   seconds of research would show this dude is holding your group back hard.  Also there are mechanical mistakes your raid is making that you just cant compensate from.  If you look at damage taken by ability youll see Rend and Tear at the top so logically youll want to figure out if you are taking too much damage from it.  This chart shows the application and falling of the debuff.  If players are properly spread out only one ranged member gets the debuff they can even dodge it! and the tank.  All you have to do is look for players who took the debuff at the exact same time.   Notice at . Basucks and Healths both got the debuff.  This is bad.  Worse is  seconds later when Darmac jumped back into melee your DK tank Brewmaster Enhancement Shaman and both Ret Paladins got affected by it  that is now  players bleeding out instead of .  This is putting a HUGE drain on healers mana early.  Im not going to go through the entire log and point out every mistake but Ill tell you one thing  your group sucks at avoiding Rend and Tear.Make the small change with making players avoiding more damage than they are and you wont feel so pressured to increase your healing.  Your healers logs are more than adequate to kill Mythic Darmac with ease.  Your DPS and tanks need to have better situational awareness.,CompetitiveWoW,cpjssbr,2,t5_35p2p
3597477,0,t1_cpyyohc,Its not just time with the target dummy its also new gear.A rogue for instance who has two slow axes will need to get better daggers and change his secondaries before he can outdps his Combat singletarget in Subtlety or Assassination. Sometimes its not an option not enough DKP weapons reserved etc.Same goes for many other classes. A hastemastery Affliction warlock cannot simply switch to Destruction and start pumping the meters on Blackhand hed need a lot of crit on his gear first and probably different set of trinkets  or his switch will not give the needed bump. His theoretical DPS might be  higher but the time he spends learning new rotation and specspecific tricks cooldown usage per fight talent choice for each fight and stuff like Havoc targets his DPS will go down not up.So no its not some time with dummy.

When possible I leave a couple of loose cooldowns that healers can use on their own if theres an emergency. But HFC has a few fights that very strongly favor fixed rotations like Iron Reaver and most favor a nonrotational order to avoid overlapping my goto assignment is to just go alphabetically.,CompetitiveWoW,csxbxjr,2,t5_35p2p

4628606,0,t3_3edtx0,I used the ring for  raid night and can confirm the aftershield only applies based on the amount you make the health bars of your raid go up. I stood in the middle of  mobs using CoW and pws and got  after shield. The active healingabsorb increase is very good and I THINK it should double dip in the following way numbers arent accurate just using some to show the intent of my point. Your halo heals for k but with buff heals for k. The aegis provided from the crit also then goes from k to k bazed on the HEALING increase. Since the ring explicitly states absorbs are also increased the aegis ABSORB is then increased from k to k. I believe it should double dip in the sense that your heal will increase and the aegis will also increase.  aegis on the heal then  aegis on the absorb.I have not tested this yet and Im aware my numbers are dreadfully wrong. Im basing this only on my intuition but also the way disc has double dipped in the past. It wouldnt surprise me to learn that aegis is indeed inflated during the active ring buff.What this means if correct is that during the ring buff you may want to utilize aegis generating spells a bit more as well as using any crit mechanics you can find. Using EAA to double dip will make that PoH aegis huge. Using intuitions gift active with a halo during the ring will make that halos aegis huge as well. One final note Id like to do some more research on as well is if there is a cap or not. Multiple times I noticed the end shield value at k. Im not sure if I was just healing the same amount each time or if I was hitting the cap each time. On mythic felt lord I had  uses for k . of my overall healing.On mythic iskar I had  uses for k . of my overall healing.,CompetitiveWoW,cte09ip,3,t5_35p2p
4641125,0,t3_3ejnqm,I have little experience with analyzing logs but on the Gorefiend kill for example his Healing Stream Totem Uptime was terrible.. he casted it  times in a  minute fight. He should also probably be using the Rushing Streams talent instead of Conductivity. HST is such an awesome ability and only needs one gcd every  seconds..I would also use High Tide on a fight like Gorefiend or pretty much always.. Chain Heal is still your bread and butter and with High Tide its so much better.. especially once you get the pc T.Theres also a pretty decent amount of time spent doing nothing.. Id suggest going for the Elemental Blast talent use that as much as possible and use all the mana you get from that to just Chain Heal and Riptide. From my experience on Gorefiend Heroic theres always something to heal unless youre in his stomach. Casting Healing Wave during the Feast of Soul phase also seems odd.. thats a period of sustained raid damage.. it might be just spot healing while other peoples cooldowns are running but generally thats a phase where Chain Heal shines. Though his healing during that phase is pretty decent in terms of meters but in the other phases hes pretty terrible dead last among your healers. For our healers they usually do twice the HPS during the feasts phase compared to the normal phase with Wolfwrath its almost  times as much.. and that is not because hes especially awesome during the feats phase.tldruse Rushing Streams Elemental Blast and High Tide as your default talents the rest is fine though I would definitely also use Totemic Projectionuse Healing Stream Totem much morecast Chain Heal more often use Elemental Blast to generate enough mana to be able to do thatwhy is there only one major glyph in the armory?cast more heals if you can afford if not use Elemental Blast more use potions etcuse Spirit Link more especially when youre using Echo of the Elements which you should.. also get Totemic Projection and use a macro for convenient repositioningfor example showtooltip Spirit Link Totemcastsequence reset Spirit Link Totem Totemic Projection,CompetitiveWoW,ctfkwod,5,t5_35p2p

ALSO FUCK ME FOR NOT USING ND POT. Seriously how did I miss that. Thanks for pointing that out really. I feel like an idiot now.Regarding usage of Displacer Beast. As I mentioned in my other comment I have a habit of panicking everytime a dangerous ability is cast Barrage in this case. Most of the time I would just blink out of the affected radius to be completely sure that I would not get hit by it only to realize that I just need to step a bit and not losing a few seconds of DPS. This is more of an ability to keep calm issue and I need to work on that.Also about Cenarion Ward I personally thinks its way more useful to me than Yseras Gift because of its proactive nature. Im aware of the global loss for this talents but tbh it have saved my ass a lot of times. I used this talent pretty regularly Artillery on Reaver stacking for hands on Korndog Kormrok Reap on Council Heartseeker on Kilrogg Doomwell on Gorefiend etc. Sometimes I used it on my guildmates before a big hit as well.

Healers and tanks generally have less to do the less damage thats going out. Aside from some outliers like Hellfire Assault there isnt really an analogous situation for damage dealers.  of the time there is going to be something to damage during a boss fight. Even on the easiest farm boss I can still go hard and try to improve my numbers more and more.Its really no more stressful than healing or tanking other than the multispec thing which I like because it adds variety. I love having  totally different specs that I can use as needed. Competition on the meters is fun but good players recognize that its not the beallendall. Just like healing the things you look for in a good DPS are proper planning an understanding of the spec and good handling of mechanics. Meters alone give a very shallow view of a players skill of course there are an unfortunate number of players out there who fail to realize this.It is easy to fall into the mindset of an individual DPS not mattering as much due to how many of them there are in a raid but really a good DPS is just as valuable as a good healer or tank. Like you acknowledged yourself higher DPS is the best way to make an encounter easier. The tankhealer core may be the heart of your raid but DPS are the lifeblood. Theres a reason most Mythic progression guilds prioritize gearing their damage dealers.,CompetitiveWoW,cv8mspe,12,t5_35p2p

I made a focus macro for the trinket with conditions written into it and I managed to keep pretty high trinket  uptime with some pug groups I did earlier today for practice.It allows me to target other targets phased add on archi etc but defaults to focus target when hes around.  It seems to have made a helpful change on my dps but Im still pretty low.Regarding the iskar fight specifically that fight felt like hell for me.  We were using a couple of pugs and to put it simply shit was all messed up.  The fire was put in bad places chakrams werent getting put in the proper places and for some reason our tanks werent aggregating the adds properly as well as moving iskar around more than is ideal.

Helpful to have purity from the pally while the priest does the other one. Its ok to use lust in phase one with a  doomfire strat while you learn phase  and  but longer term you should be planning on dropping it and using it for one of the last  infernal waves.  desecreate    wrought    wrought    wrought      infernal mark  secs before    infernal mark  secs before    infernal mark  secs before    infernal mark  secs before  are the general timings although it depends how fast you are pushing him. Dont need a CD for descrate but you may as well use one that you are saving for later in the fight. Each of the wroughts and infernals should have a CD.

Our MR and ML are close enough together that PC hits them both but the infernals dont heal. So Im hitting  infernals  the boss during the ring with my CDs up.Even if you have a different strat or too far away you should at least pop AP to nuke the infernals with the ring and then just PC on the boss. Or use PCAP on an infernal then when that infernal dies just leave the PC alone and swap to other infernals with the remainder of the duration of your AP. Infernals are very key and everyone needs to switch to them. Even Melee and if you lose your PC during that time thats okay because its progression your DPS doesnt matter.

Looks like youre ringing  lusting s in when akkelion has spawned. People need to be syncing their DPS cds to this since its ring and lust. Note this is not the only place where DPS can improve. This was just the easiest for me to check.Players who arent doing thisIrrvala. Use first pillar with ring. I also dont think hes using his level  talent at all which is dumb as hell. If youre going to play NP use unholy blight.Arrinis hoggerr. Rapid fire should always be synced with ring. Using rapid fire at the start of the fight when youre ringing s in actually makes  sense since youll be under careful aim anyway at the start of the fight. Get TMW or something to tell you when your raid rings. When you see ring pop up use your CDs. This is like day one legendary ring stuff for a class that has a  minute cd.Bubble. hes using his first avenging wrath too late so that by the time it wears off ring is finished and he wont have wings of liberty up during ring. If he uses avenging wrath immediately on the pull he can use the second charge as ring goes off to have Wings of Liberty during ring.The rogues could also be doing a better job of lining up red guile amp adrenaline rush with the ring.

7742808,0,t3_4lbfbi,Can your resto druid go boomkin and play at a decent level? You should be  healing and they are the obvious choice to also help your imp problem. In the big dumb guild strat you should ignore the last set of infernals and push boss and imps. Save priest bubble and devo for that first combo you will get with imps and hellstorm. Also grip on the tanks this phase. The extra boomkin with your warriors will really help control them. Also note in the BDG strat they dont really go over the final phase transition very well imo. What we do is when the ranged bait the nd felseeker in p we all stay out and move the boss away from the pillar. This stops the pillar lightning from zapping people. Once we move the boss a little away basically tanked on the box of markers we pop hero and all cool downs melee who get Wrath pop all cool downs and when they end and hero ends they suicide off. The ranged that get it suicide off after shadow force because they do not join the group for the slime. Mages are the only ones I have seen that survive this with blink into altered time.

The good news is that weve seen Blizzard make hotfixes to talent trees even so far as removing items and making others baseline so that seems to be on the table.  Also I do strongly believe that Destruction could be great with some numbers changes and perhaps some more Soul Shard generation.  I dont think Havoc should ever be permanent as it greatly reduces the design space for the class and encounters.Affliction Im not sure about.  The idea of having instant cast dots doing most of your damage just opens it up to multitarget abuse.  Haunt is a test of a compromise by having a cooldown but it does such poor damage that its hard to say whether we can see Affliction get some performance tweaks without making it too strong on what its already good at.  I think if Drain Soul had its damage greatly increased as well as Haunt wed see Affliction continue to do well in what it does nicely already without opening up the room for more abuse.

9315215,0,t3_581jxd,Hello  M fire mage here killed Ursoc  hours ago in  attempts. My dps on each pull was around k and k on the kill I did die sec before the fight was over. Im on phone right now so I just quickly compared your logs to mine. First off I would recommend Kindling instead of Cinderstorm. Yes even with Sinew. What you can do is use Sinew prepull as normal then use it on cd once meaning min in then delay it for around sec depending on your remaining Combusition cd and when the boss hits  and Hero is popped.I also have to say that I didnt use Scorch once this tier. Its not needed on any fight imo. I hope you know the Ice Floes trick or bug or whatever you want to call it where you use Ice Floes at  of a casting spell which means you can cast  spells while moving if pulled of correctly not that you would really need that but still good to know sometimes. When soaking Momentum while casting a Fireball for instance use Ice Floes and turn to Ursoc when he runs through you so you dont waste a second of dps  time.Another thing I noticed is that on average you cast way more Fireballs than me while I cast Pyro way more. That is probably a little bit of luck because of crit with food buff Im at  but also some good skill in managing your conversions of Heating Up.One more key thing is Rune of Power positioning. For the first  Roars you honestly dont even have to stand in meele range to soak them as a mage they dont do that much damage. Rather focus on positioning your Rune forward enough so you wont have to move from it because of Miasma.Ok I think thats all I can think of at  am while laying in bed. If you have any more questions I will check back later.,CompetitiveWoW,d8wrt5e,5,t5_35p2p

9500435,0,t1_d9k3wly,I understand. So essentially you go to the timepoint where people die and you look at what caused it to happen. I.E. Did the dragon on cenarius live too long? Did they step on brambles? Etc. Our tanks died a few times even on the second platform without raking talons. We ended up clearing the fight but it seemed our tanks died a lot for no reason during that fight. And we have H EN on farm so this  wipes on elerethe was rather alarming.I didnt think of looking at the damage like that the DKs dmg then the defensives so thanks for showing me that line of thinking.In general on progression does there need to be a cooldown on the tanking tank at all times? Either healer external or Tank cooldown On elerethe theres tons of downtime so tons of time for CDs to come back up. Is it necessary to rotate cooldowns over Discord This is ending im using this im taunting off and cooldown etc?Edit Also i dont understand how the boss did  mil dmg PER HIT! How didnt that just  shot the tank? How did them melee hits do so much? it says m dmg in the timeline but then the avg hit section is .mil.

10069186,0,t3_5jxlqu,Hello multiple Keystone Master here.As our guild requires multiple alts I am obligated to run s on several characters every week for weekly chest since thats the source of  of gear on atls. From the top of my head I can think of these few tips that you may hopefully find useful. Always ask for nick of their main and check wowprogress and warcraftlogs. Did they finish only once  in time on SangOver of course but note one since? How many mythic bosses did they kill? Frankly if theyre doing only  bosses in Mythic EN they can easily get  gear but there is a really big chance theyre just not good enough for doing more than that. Bring the player not an ilvl e.g. recently weve cleared  Nelt RVT with  DH tank  MW monk myself and a  ish random altdps squad in time of course even with  wipe. The only sing of problem was the last boss since it was oneshotting the tank so we had to kite the last . Im not implying that player from a casual guild cant be capable enough for harder content Im saying that player from a more hardcore guild is much more likely to be. Be patient. Do not hesitate to wait up to  minutes to find the peoplesetup you are comfortable with it is your key anyway. If other already joined members are not willing to take that long good you do not want impatient people. Also if you complete the run and youre satisfied with the group ask others if they want to run it more often and perhaps add them on real id. Assemble your team accordingly to weekly affixes. BolsteringSkittish? Bring Balance Druid spread aoe dmghigh armor rdd MM Hunter misdirectFD RShammyHpally spiky healing. Eye of Azshara with Tyrranical? Shadow priest and an Arms warrior are wise choices for their execute damage.In general affixes and team composition are more of a deal breaker than a keystone level. However if youre careful while forming your group up until  you should be able to at least  chest anything even with pug.  chests require either good afiixes or incredible overgear and not making bigger mistakes. TLDR My opinion? lt  feel free to pug  be careful require at least one achievement or some proof of worth still puggable though.  be extremely wise and pick ppl with raiding backstorymultiple  kills on various affixes definetly consider using voice com. It is doable but requires ppl with patience and experience which is rather rare thing nowadays. If u intend to push  more often definetly consider joining progression guildstable group it will save you so much pain.Hope I helped u at least a little bit if u were to have any further or other questions feel free to ask.,CompetitiveWoW,dbk1d6p,12,t5_35p2p

10224185,0,t3_5mdt4f,Damage on Odyn is relatively constant with the main bursts coming from Hyrja and Hymdalls big abilities in P Unerring Blasts and Storm Spears. Have timers for all those abilities. Odyn is one of our weaker fights just because people are spread out often for P but we do great on P and our CDs are good enough to carry us through P.Big thing thats impacting your healing You have  healers in a m raid? Youre definitely not going to heal much of anything. Mastery will suck and too much competition on healing that people are likely trying to pad.With that said theres some errors Ive noticed mostly in spell and talent usage.. I dont see any Spiritwalkers Grace casted. Treat SWG as a miniCD you use whether its maximizing a Cloudburst for particular mechanics or making sure you can top people off while moving around spears but you shouldnt have used it zero times on your kill.. Mana Usage You had  mana at the end of the kill so you can definitely afford to use more. I imagine thats why you didnt use a mana pot but in that case you couldve used Prolonged Power or something. Its nice to have a resource of mana in case of emergencies but you definitely can afford to spend more than  of your mana.. Since it looks like you have mana you can definitely cast more Chain Heals.  casts is awfully low. If youre running a CH build cast more CH and less Healing Wave and Healing Surge. You have a Holy Priest in your raid they can handle the spot healing while you CH. Should be casting more RTs as well.. CD usage One use of Ancestral Guidance. One use of Healing Tide Totem. One use of Spirit Link Totem. You can definitely cast more of them. If they want you to hold it for a specific point use it earlier so that it comes off CD by the time you need it. This applies to your Gift of the Queen and other spells as well. Youre not casting nearly as much as you should.. Talent Choices If youre consistently running a small raid size then High Tide might not be that good for Odyn. I dont really have any personal experience with heroics with that small of a raid group but I would imagine the benefits of High Tide are probably going to be wasted. I would run High Tide in Mythic Odyn or in larger groups though.. Talent Choices  I see you use the Unleash Life buff on other spells. If youre using Unleash Life you need to use them for Chain Heal not for other spells otherwise its not worth taking. If you want a talent to help with the constant moving run Torrent instead.,CompetitiveWoW,dc2yvrj,3,t5_35p2p

10355375,0,t3_5oaco6,Only took a quick glance as i am not a main druid palyer. I only took a loog at your dragons kill so everythign i say is only for that.Your other druid moondude has maxed out his artefact wepon so it will be normal that he would take less dmg if they both palyed the same.He has very low number of casts of ironfur  the logs show  cast of ironfur on your dragons kill.That is way to little he should work on maintaining a high uptime on this.He could also probably repalce a few of his items that have a lot of crit on them. The ursoc trinket he ahs is not very good  unless you plan to use it for a specific mechanic but for voerall use he can probably find somethign better.Also it looks like he used no potions during the fight.He used a lot of maul casts  costs  rage  you should only maul if you have to much rage and need to get rid of some or if you are doing easy content and just want to push dmg to get it done faster but since he has a very bad uptime on his ironfur he should have spend his rage for that.He only used his artifact ability  twice during the fight he could probably get more uses out of that.He also got hit by sleeping fog  times he should try to avoid getting hit by that if at all possible.It also looks like he has a lot of downtime he is not using his skills as often as he should not quite sure what he is doing during that time but that is a reason why he is taking more dmg than your other tank.

10606132,0,t3_5rqxbm,Didnt check all the logs but something general firstAffliction warlock logs are somewhat iffy when it comes to ranking. If you did trash shortly before the boss and then proceed to kill it directly after meaning no wipe the affliction lock can start the fight with stacks of Reap Souls he got from the trash before the boss. However if you wipe you start with  stacks. This poses a problem for the logs because most of the really good logs have been created by locks who had the opportunity to carry their Reap Soul stacks from trash to the boss thus greatly enhancing their dps.That being said His trinkets are dogshit even a mediocre statstick intmastery would be better. The neck enchant is wrong too by now Trained Soldier is better than both Claw or Hidden Satyr.Im guessing he went for pure ilvl increase on the relics which isnt the worst offence but he should be looking into trading them in for some better traits like Perdition.What really grinds my gears is that hes missing an enchant on his ring  secondary stat and on his cloak  int is huge no excuse not getting it also hes missing a gem too on the ring again.Going by his armory profile his secondary stats arent well balanced. He should go for way more mastery up until   and then balance out crithaste to around . As of now he has too much haste not enough mastery and a very low amount of crit which would bite him in the ass even more if he had better relics  those with the Perdition trait.Last but not least he seems to forget about the second potion a lot. Since affliction locks benefit greatly from Prolonged Power because int is so strong he should really aim for getting a second one of those in preferably about a minute before the kill. In this phase his doomguard will do more damage due to being in execute range. An addon like time to die helps predicting when to best use the second potion if the raid lead doesnt decide when its needed most.Now when it comes to rotation theres one major fuckup he usually uses Reap Souls BEFORE casting Unstable Affliction. This is a big nono. The basic rotation is as follows Wait for at least  stacks of reap souls then UAUAReapDrain Soul. The first tick from UA doesnt do damage until about  after its been cast so you can cast a second UA and immediatly Reap Souls thus enhancing both UAs fully for all their ticks with Reap Souls. After that Drain Souls with Malefic Grasp will enhance the damage even more.As a general rule he shouldnt use Reap Souls without chaining it to UA casts since those are most important to be enhanced by it. But as seen here Triliax fight timeline he just mixes them in basically whenever he feels like it. That reduces his damage greatly. Basically you always want to follow the rotation I outlined above with some exemptions possible for the bloodlust phase where you can actually get away with casting  UAs before Reap Souls and Drain soul or for when stuff proccs that gives lots of Haste like the Guldan trinket or Chronoshard or something like that.But honestly the affliction rotation outside of that is simple Keep Agony up all the time keep Corruption up really easy if hes speccing into Absolute Corruption which he did and then always be trying to get off the combo UAUAReap SoulDrain Soul when you have at least  stacks of Reap Souls. Thats pretty much it.TLDR tell him to fix his gear get better trinkets and teach him how to do a proper rotation.Edit Didnt see this the first time because theres so much else thats wrong but one more really important thing he needs to use Drain Soul as much as possible. With the talents he took it increases the damage of his dots by a massive   but hes using is so rarely he might as well take another talent. Thats a really glaring problem and he needs to fix this ASAP or his damage will be shit. Just to put this into perspective The damage he did on Trilliax is about what my warlock did with  ilvls less and before the patch. And Im a pretty shit warlock myself. So yeah...this is bad. The good news is if he fixes those rotational problems hell do a shitload of damage in no time. ,CompetitiveWoW,dd9xwdc,3,t5_35p2p

10660435,0,t3_5sj9mt,Hey! So being that Aluriel seems to be Frost Phase The Boss it is very important to have an understanding of the frost mark mechanic. I will lay out the mechanics of the ability the best I can.Aluriel will apply the frost mark to  random ranged characters. It will pulse every second or two and cause you to gain a stack that increases damage taken by the damage and pulse I believe. To remove the debuff two players with the mark must collide with each other. This much I am sure you already know. The ability has a few restrictions and nuances. When two players touch the two marks will go to the two nearest players causing them to take on the debuff and start gaining frostbitten stacks. However the ability will not jump to any player that already has the frostbitten debuff regardless of how close they are to the people who touch which will punish groups that touch to remove the debuff at low stacks and will eventually cause the marks to spread to melee if they are being passed too often. When my group killed it on heroic we actually just have the players touch at  and we just separate and touch with our partner and we dealt with the spread of the debuff until it expired. That said a controlled way to deal with the ability is difficult to explain.sorry this is a bit of a rambleThe mythic strategy is a very good controlled way to handle the mechanic. Setup a group of  players and  backup for each pair who will handle the debuffs. When the first set of them goes out the two players who got it go off to the side with one pair of the assigned soakers or a backup if one of the assigned players is chosen Those players will form a square and the two players with the debuff will touch at  passing it to the people on the other side of the square. these players will continue to pass the mark back and forth until it expires. importantly the people two remove the debuff from themselves cannot return to the ranged stack because they have to be there to receive the debuff when the assigned players need to drop theirs. Same goes for the replicated marks the nd set the boss puts on players. Two more random people are chosen. They go off to the other side of the ranged stack group and form another square with the other pair of assigned players. They touch at  for the first go around and  every time thereafter. After the first touch from both players they can move into the middle of the encounter area for detonate to drop the frost pools.If this explanation was hard to grasp I know. It is a very difficult boss to learn for those not mechanically inclined. However learning it this way will help on progression in mythic if you aspire to reach that. Also methods video is very very good at showing how they deal with the mark of frost. you can watch how they juggle it back and forth between the two pairs of players on either side of the ranged group.any more questions let me know!,CompetitiveWoW,ddfjju0,9,t5_35p2p

I will also tell you that I have never simd BoS build and get near top parses. Current raid tier is SO MUCH more than just standing still on the boss and doing your rotationability priority. If you want to get better parses get better at the mechanics of each fight. With that practice you will start making decisions that no sim can do. Thats where the best players excell. Not in their end all be all sims.Other factors like your raids strats and Tanking habits will play a big role in how you dps. The last and most important note I will say here. When youre trying to parse well shoot for between th and th percentiles. Those players are doing mechanics and not being catered to by their raid for higher parses. When youre doing mechanics correctly you will start seeing those Orange ranking numbers appear in your logs.,CompetitiveWoW,ddjomhp,1,t5_35p2p

Wiping early because healers dont want to heal people who fuck up to save mana is a pretty poor reason and I say this as a healer.  Wiping at  mana because youre saving it is a worse situation than wiping at  mana because people were screwing up but you were able to keep it going for a while.Early pulls on any boss healers are likely to run out of mana because people are learning timings spell effects etc but its in an effort to learn the encounter.

The marks will time out on their own shortly after the charge.We pop rally there to help carry us there and people need to be prepared for personals.,CompetitiveWoW,dekq6c8,3,t5_35p2p
11063925,0,t3_5xw8k9,As has already been stated Resto Druid Resto Sham and HPaladin are the trinity. However this fight is as much about your raid doing the strat properly as it is your healing team... fuck up the soaking and youre screwed. Personally in hindsight Id take who ever your most competent healers are... though Im not sure Id fancy doing it without a hpala.,CompetitiveWoW,dem2wp2,1,t5_35p2p
11125600,0,t3_5yrea4,Honestly you should basically be afk dpsing until p as a disc priest and then be given all the innervates to heal through at least  Harvests. Guilds use Disc priest wrong they arnt like regular healers. Giving you an innervate basically makes you a Raid CD at any time. You just need prep.,CompetitiveWoW,det2smp,2,t5_35p2p
11135298,0,t1_deu3gss,gt When looking for a guild check its ageThis this holy shit this! Go to wowprogress and check its previous tiers progress. If it full cleared tiers going back several tiers  expansions you should be ok. Theres always going to be exceptions but having been around this game for awhile and made a few mistakes the guilds that implode are far more likely to have a track record of calling tiers early or just being brand new.,CompetitiveWoW,deu6bfm,9,t5_35p2p

11193319,0,t1_dezd103,I really like this idea. I think its a matter of figuring out how to implement it properly that will be the small hurdle there that fortunately I dont have to deal with because Im just the artist!. Muffinator suggested something below but our site isnt written in Python and Im not sure whether that would make a difference. ,CompetitiveWoW,df0qzpi,1,t5_35p2p
11259456,0,t1_df878yp,Sera is definitely a survivability loss no question about it. With M trash you basically just have to kill it before it kills you. With bosses damage is predictable again and you can be ready with SotR when you need it. Pay attention to your DBM timers theyre there for a reason. If youve got . changes of SotR and Dark Slash is coming up in  seconds go ahead and use Sera. Ive used Sera on everything except Skorp Im adds so I use Last Defender until Mythic Botanist. I needed to take Righteous Protector so I could survive as long as possible in P and Sera wasnt cutting it. I probably wont be use it going forward not because I cant survive but simply because our healers are being taxed and running RP makes me less of a burden as well as allowing me to toss out some spare HotPs on my cotank or the rest of the raid. edit Forgot about the Annihilates. Annihilate is on around a s timer so you have plenty of time to bank up the SotRs for your next Sera as well as having one up for Annihilate. Do make sure you use SotR right before the damage starts not in the middle of the cast she does a cast before it starts then channels the damage and you want to SotR right as the channel starts because then one SotR covers the full duration and you dont need a second. On a similar note Trilliax likes to juke when he changes phases hell start casting and then interrupt himself. Since I dont have an SotR charge to waste I make sure to use SotR at the very last second before Arcane Slash hits. ,CompetitiveWoW,df88qr4,1,t5_35p2p
11268321,1,t3_60tzdf,I RL in a casual  nights a week allmsot  mythic guild and since the first  bosses arent really a dps check at all i dont worry about it too much. unless ur a top end guild ur never going to get really really high parses because u dont kill the boss fast enough. u simply have less bloodlust uptime etc. if someones consistently underperforming u might want to look to help them out for the later bosses where dps is more of a factor though.,CompetitiveWoW,df98x2r,0,t5_35p2p
11276395,0,t1_dfa2d9c,But he also has bis legendaries which is part of the issue we are discussing what if he didnt have those? Hed probably be parsing purples in that case and stupid people would overlook his skill and contribution to the raid mechanically and say hes not as good a player.,CompetitiveWoW,dfa5vph,3,t5_35p2p
11281753,0,t3_610eri,Im confused. You want something to tell you when youre your CDs but isnt that what  DBMbigwigs are for? Some things bosses do are health based like Skorp shedding his armor but most are timer based and will show on DBMBW. For example icy ejections on star Augur will always happen a certain time after he reaches enters ice phase and botanist will cast controlled chaosplasma spheres a certain time after one of the bosses dies new phase new timers,CompetitiveWoW,dfarqdj,0,t5_35p2p

11337339,0,t3_61t6i0,I think it is smarter to wait until there are some wacraftlogs statistics or smililar things to compare specs.These simulationcraft rankings are to my knowledge often rushed with not yet optimized APLs and dont get updated very often. In addition to that they dont really represent the strength of a spec as a whole and only small sometimes irrelevant parts of a boss fight.If it is taking to long for you a thing you could do is invest a little time and create such a list yourself. ,CompetitiveWoW,dfh2g3u,2,t5_35p2p
11352619,0,t3_61zpoz,Its definitely not going to be OP.For my character it might not even be better than the  haste or mast. Its the same ratio as Sabers Eye vs a regular gem and I recently replaced my Sabers for a gain. ,CompetitiveWoW,dfisr0m,4,t5_35p2p
11361394,0,t3_624ngr,Draught is miserably bad for ret its in the bottom  for AoE and hardly worth using on single given it interferes greatly with CrusadeThat being said Mark is very poor on single and youd probably not take it unless the fight had a lot of cleave Id use Mark for cleave but check the Silverhand chart in the other comment willing to bet if you have those two trinkets you probably have an  thats better in your bag somewhere,CompetitiveWoW,dfjsjy5,3,t5_35p2p

11476282,0,t3_63taz5,Personally Id run druid druid priest shaman. I think doubling on the druid is your best bet. We regularly run with two druids and theres no problem. Their healing outside of tranq is very predictable and the throughput is high. Try to recruit a pally since their passive tank heals and large bursts are useful but skip on the monk its already very similar to what you have in abundance. Between the holy priest and druid hots on the tanks they should be fine.,CompetitiveWoW,dfwtz12,3,t5_35p2p
11527751,0,t1_dg2lats,I mean k HPS is such a low bar that theres no way someone would have passed trial for a mythic guild if they were struggling to hit that mark. Its one thing if theres absolutely no damage going out or you have too many healers but even on mythic Trilliax our lowest healer is usually pulling at least k.All of that being said healing is a zerosum game and any officer for a mythic guild that is using only HPS to judge the worth of a healer is doing it wrong.,CompetitiveWoW,dg2o7wk,9,t5_35p2p

11533855,0,t1_dg340tr,That isnt the total value of hymn though. You need to look at the pom jumps renews holy mending procs and the echo left by all of that. Also dont forget the  extra healing that all targets effected by hymn recieve for its duration. ,CompetitiveWoW,dg3d51v,6,t5_35p2p
11562726,0,t3_651b0a,First and main thing your prayer of mending casts are basically non existant.  casts on a  minute plus fight? You should be casting this on cooldown with  exceptions you are dead you are moving in order to avoid being dead you are in emergency heal mode in order to prevent someone else from being dead.I am on mobile so i cant dig through everything but PoM needs to be a super high priority spell and i woild suggest getting a weakaura thay tracks its timer. ,CompetitiveWoW,dg6n1mq,3,t5_35p2p
11628434,0,t3_65x933,Fury is fine and Demon Hunters are a dime a dozen. I would just recruit another DH to be honest. Start spamming trade chat and the server forums.If youre deadset on rerolling Havoc I would say that Havoc is a lot more legendary dependent than Fury and that there is far more RNG and inconsistency built into the spec. You have more clearly defined burst windows every  minutes during which bad RNG will ruin your dps and good RNG will make you feel like a god.,CompetitiveWoW,dge3g40,3,t5_35p2p
11628445,0,t1_dgdwp3b,gt  I dont wanna play a Rettype class where they rely on burst and hit like a wet noodle without.From what I understand all current Havoc subspecs rely on heavy frontloaded burst with moderategood sustained.  IIRC the top meterpadding right now is  investment into the burst and the other spec is just  frontloaded burst with shorter burst cycles.Im not really sure what youre talking about with regards to Fury though  Furys also rather skewed towards burst with the Draught at the moment.  Although Battle Cry isnt a base m cooldown or we Meta is so I guess its not as bad D.  Honestly Id say theyre fairly similar with the burst gt sustained patterns and the seamless target switching.  Havoc does have some procs though so its not as predictable as Fury.,CompetitiveWoW,dge3hq7,6,t5_35p2p
