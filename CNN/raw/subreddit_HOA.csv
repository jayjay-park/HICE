11736376,0,t1_dgqbc0y,HOA  Your HOA is actually you and your neighbors coming together to share common responsibilities.  Youve also agreed on certain rules like no dogs in elevators.  In order to facilitate the management of the organization and to handle enforcement of the rules a few volunteers from your neighbors have stepped up to serve on the board of directors.  The owners voted to approve those members.  The board in turn has delegated certain day to day tasks to a rd party service company.  That company does whatever the board tells it to do.  The board cant do anything outside the authority granted by the owners.Your management company is the central point where bills letters etc reach the legal entity that is your incorporated HOA.  Sending the letter to them will require it to be forwarded to the board for discussion.What you ran into was one idiot being an idiot.  People are people and a lot of them are actually idiots.  Your request needs to be formalized and a certified letter is as formal as it gets.  Do that before the meeting well in advance if possible.  In your request include reference to the fair housing act and the relevant sections that apply to you.  It is possible youll get your reasoned approval before the meeting.  If not you can also make the same request at the meeting.Were we to get some similar request our first response would be to either approve it or hand it to our lawyer.  We wouldnt say no out of hand to something that references federal law.  We also might not be prepared to say yes at a board meeting.  ,HOA,dgqcjav,2,t5_2vzym
