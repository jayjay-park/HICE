5269020,0,t3_3n2z9a,I think many people have a special place in their heart for this conceptRealistically speaking when Im in a fire I dont want a whole lot of stuff crowding up my face. Simplicity is important. Indication of how much air I have remaining is important temperaturehazards would be important and maybe other alertswhere people areetc might be useful. Mappingtracking exits might be interesting. Built in thermal imaging capability especially as it becomes costefficient could be nice but that is the kind of thing that I would want to be able to toggle.My biggest struggle now is being heard  I have a very small voice. Were limited on the type of radios we can use so I think my biggest wishlist tool is a radio mic hook up that goes into my mask. This from the description of your project may be outside of the scope.I dont know much about how firefighting is done outside of the US but most companies here are volunteer and have limited budget and technological ability if you have an officer that can take on complex technology its more likely to be used. We recently looked at the new MSA packs but are unlikely to invest timemoney in much of the fun capabilities because we just dont have people that can configure them or officers on the fire ground that can use them and computers with ease. So  with whatever you make how can it be affordable enough for a city department or simple enough for a country department?Please do this project. I think there is a lot of interest but figuring out a scope that will be helpful and satisfying to you will be difficult. One of the firefighting industry forums might be another good place to pose this question.,firefighter,cvl6cyl,2,t5_2svis
