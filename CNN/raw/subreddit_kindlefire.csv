I downloaded one of the multitude of APK Extractor apps from the Play Store on my phone converted the emulator to an APK which I then uploaded to Dropbox.

7934573,0,t3_4nx8ip, is a steal IMO. We have three one for each kid and they work awesome for them. Yes theyre not the best. But theyre way better than what youd expect for  in a sea of tablets that climbs into the hundreds. Youll definitely want a micro SD card to expand the storage the onboard gig more like . will go quickly.,kindlefire,d47x5kx,4,t5_2sx68

9539094,0,t1_d9on0xz,Agree with above but Ill add  Get the gb version.Kids use games.  Games take up a ton of memory.  They have a fire but also a couple of phones with gb and I am constantly being asked to help them load a game because theyve run out of space.  The phone itself will use up gb .. load  games and suddenly youre running out of room.Spend the extra  for gb.,kindlefire,d9ow494,3,t5_2sx68

11755667,0,t1_dgsizef,Hm I would ask over on rtablets rAndroid or rAndroidTablets to see if they can recommend an alternative.I would speculate that part of the reason the Amazon tablets are so cheap is that they really want you to buy one with the intention of buying apps and content from their ecosystem so they subsidize the initial cost to get you locked in. Given that vanilla Android is more open as far as where and how you buy apps and content there is probably less incentive for manufacturers like Samsung or Sony to beat Amazons price  they want to make their money from the hardware itself unlike Amazon who wants you to buy the tablet so you buy other stuff from them. They also make shopping Amazon really easy to do from the tablet for obvious reasons.,kindlefire,dgsj915,2,t5_2sx68
