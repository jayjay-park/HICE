2084336,0,t1_cl4rcza,gtI do wonder if the relationship between Graham Hancock and hallucinogens and my having stopped any kind of contact with drugs in the past few years is whats going on here  that maybe I am being guided by not only myself but a higher force represented by my father who passed away to do away with it completely and move on and the pod of dolphins represents all of the different incredible ways to interact with the spiritualotherworldly side of life.You just touched it. Dolphins are the most social and playful creatures possibly on earth considering how advanced their frontal cortex is. Maybe this represents breaking free of a certain circle of friends that were keeping you stuck in a negative vortex? Have you made any significant changes in the friends that you hangout with?P.S. I think mushrooms are incredibly powerful if used with the right intent.,Lausari,cl4rjly,2,t5_32v92
