8809132,0,t3_50sn8h,Have you been working out at all? One thing that really helps me is even if I am not seeing results on the scale or tape measure is to see how I am doing physically. Can I do more pushups or actually do a push up... I got noodle arms or hold a plank longer than before? Is jogging or walking a lot easier and am I less out of breath afterwards?Another thing is to look at how your lifestyle has changed for the better. Do you no longer crave certain junk foods or maybe now you actually enjoy random vegetables and eating healthy? ,TeamTwister,d76qk8f,1,t5_3f9mm
9170486,0,t3_5579hl,Well Im pretty disappointed because I only ended up  pounds lighter than I was at the beginning of the challenge . lbs heavier than my lowest weight during the challenge.  I was doing really well until school started in late August and I started struggling with binge eating on a fairly regular basis.Im most proud of myself for not giving up when things got difficult. This goes for my diet and my exercise.With my diet there were so many times I felt discouraged by my binge eating episodes and felt like giving up but I kept logging and doing my best to get right back on track after each time it happened.With my exercise I injured my IT bands on week  of CK and had to stop running kist when I was really starting to enjoy it!. But instead of giving up all exercise I kept going to the gym and just did what I was able to do upper body with weights bodyweight routine for lower body and cycling for cardio. I still cant get back into running yet but Im consistently lifting including weighted lower body lifts x per week and doing  minutes of cardio cycling andor elliptical x per week.What I still need to work on  I do really well with planning and portioning my meals and snacks but I need to reel in my binge eating so it will stop inhibiting my progress with weight loss. Im working on it with my therapist so I anticipate that problem will eventually be solved with a lot of hard work on my part.Even with my recent weight loss stagnation I feel like I am well on my way to reaching my long term goals of getting stronger and reducing my body fat percentage to around  Im at around  right now. Ive been building some muscle and now Im gearing up to lose that last  pounds or so and kick binge eating in the ass.I do plan to participate in the next challenge and I cant wait! I found the community and the weekly checkins and interteam challenges helped keep my goals in the forefront of my mind.,TeamTwister,d8efe4p,1,t5_3f9mm
