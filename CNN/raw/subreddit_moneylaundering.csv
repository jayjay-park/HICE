8202281,0,t3_4rori4,Currently in the process of preparing for the exam. My company did pay for it but I was more than willing to shell out the k or so for the materials. Im sure you can find some free resources online to prepare for the exam before taking the test if needed. I would highly suggest getting the CAMS yourself if your company does not pay for it. Its really the main certification for any AML role youll have in your career. Plus if during the job hunt it came down to two candidates between you and another person and you win out cause you have the CAMS cert it would have paid for it self a hundred times over. ,moneylaundering,d52u7mu,5,t5_2sd7n
