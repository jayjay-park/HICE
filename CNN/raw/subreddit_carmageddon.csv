6685598,0,t1_d0au978,I have still have issues running it smoothly and my system isnt exactly on the cheap side. And even disregarding that Reincarnation hasnt been ported to OS X or Linux as promised. If they were a big studio with different teams I would understand but they dont have a lot of resources and its not fair for them to ignore the people on those platforms who were promised a port and may have even contributed to the Kickstarter. ,carmageddon,d0aul1z,1,t5_2sj98
