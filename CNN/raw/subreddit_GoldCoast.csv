230474,0,t3_1wqn5q,It really just depends on the type of places youre hanging at and the type of crowds and people those places encourage. The mentality of men in Australia is as nice or even better than men in other countries. The mentality of guys you meet at night on a weekend around surfers can be atrociousness. The throwaway account that first responded is absolutely right Surfers and places like Bryon Bay is known for being a meatmarket with lots of international students and backpackers visiting.,GoldCoast,cf4mxbn,5,t5_2shzr

Creating a fb group for GC reddit meets might also be a good idea...easier to organise stuff on there and can get to know everyone a little easier. ,GoldCoast,cmjeoko,1,t5_2shzr
2726959,0,t3_2ralil,Check the Translink website out it has a destination planner which is decent. On the coast its easy to get around not  how you would get from the hotel to the theme parks but most likely get a bus to Helensvale train station then a bus from there. ,GoldCoast,cne1l5x,2,t5_2shzr

3701713,0,t1_cqe5f29,Is it going to hook up with Helensvale QR station? That would make plenty of sense. Westfield for shopping but hooking up train to lightrail will take plenty of cars off the road and make the existing bus routes redundant while offering a more reliable service to get tofrom Brisbane.Im just looking forward to eventually being remembered down south and having that airport to airport connection going we were supposed to get some  years ago.,GoldCoast,cqe7xds,4,t5_2shzr

5830334,0,t1_cxjrd86,Usually I always swim at the beach but some friends recommended this lake.  It was really nice for a change to swim in water that was calm and still without having huge waves trying to kill you.I was a bit apprehensive about swimming across the lake as it was a bit murky and I get the fear in deep water but it was liberating and quite refreshing.   I just trusted that there were no sharks in there.  Or big bitey fish.,GoldCoast,cxjvsa0,1,t5_2shzr

Also say he is being unreasonable by saying you cant cook food on your property. Just dont cause a huge uproar. Then again.

Then we want to talk about what you think the causes and solutions are. One of the key points of the doco is also to do with sex education.  ,GoldCoast,d39jx4b,1,t5_2shzr

Hopefully theyll just let it roll over and wont check credentials especially if youre paying  weeks upfront.Without a job though and no income I would suggest biting the bullet and house sharing and renting a room to minimise costs til you get a steady income.Sorry for your loss.

8356692,0,t3_4u1fai,It happens. Not every path is going to be perfectly smooth and this looks like the kind of path that wouldnt be. Its not like its concrete. Its stone. Its probably not going to be even. If you see surfaces like these when youre with a toddler you should perhaps hold their hand or put them in a pram so they dont trip over. I wouldnt dream of picking a fight with the council if my toddler tripped over on a path. Thats ridiculous. If I feel like my toddler is at risk I pick her up. I dont demand the council to change things. Not every place has to be toddler friendly. ,GoldCoast,d5m50bt,8,t5_2shzr
