757618,0,t1_cgpvenr,Syntax only is similar. JavaScript is a form of ECMAScript a weakly typed prototype based language. Java is a strongly typed Object Oriented language. Learning pure JavaScript is actually harder in many ways than Java. Prototypes will bend your mind Java especially in the implementation that Android has is really quite straight forward.,learnandroid,cgqec46,1,t5_2shcl

7271791,0,t1_d24o50p,Yeah Im the same boat. The lack of documentation is a bit frustrating and unfortunately I dont believe it will see any significant improvements until Android Wear kicks it off a bit more than it already has. As it stands now Id say to do whatever works. Fortunately the UI seems pretty straight forward so if you construct the Wear app in a modular manor you can easily revisit the data transferstorage situation in the future. I am emulating the wear device too... that comes with its own collection of issues lol. Does Android Wear occasionally drop its connection and refuses to connect until you check on the status? Its like I have to catch it in the act... ,learnandroid,d24r523,1,t5_2shcl
7966888,0,t3_4ob5tn,Id roughly say there is nothing you need but there are several things you can do for a better experience. Question is what your wallet allows. Its already been mentioned that Intel CPUs are nice if you use virtual devices. AMD is falling so far behind these days you are likely going with an Intel CPU anyways A decent CPU is always a musthave. If going with Intel see if you can ditch the U CPUs. They are lowvoltage cheap and found in slim laptops for a reason. Thats not to say you cant get by with one. See if you can get a SSD instead of a regular HDD. To be honest I would sacrifice the CPU before ever getting a HDD again. The SSD will shave many seconds off launching Android Studio and compiling your software. It might seem trivial but when you compile many many times in a day it makes a difference. RAM is pretty trivial. Unless you are going for a really lowend computer most newer laptops come with at least  GB RAM which is sufficient. Whether it is DDR or DDR will not make a major difference for you. Being stuck with  GB RAM is however not preferable.,learnandroid,d4bjy2c,1,t5_2shcl
