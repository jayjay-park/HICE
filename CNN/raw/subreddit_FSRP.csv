Achilles stated as she looked over her shoulder at her master as she once again began chanting. Once finished Achilles raised an eyebrow in surprise as the familiar weight of her armor seemed to drop away. It felt almost disconcerting like she was naked but with a quick glance down at herself she confirmed that her armor was still there and intact. She summoned her spear into her right hand and once again the familiar weight of her trusted partner was almost nonexistent. She spun it around at her side a few times before suddenly springing into action against a force of imaginary enemies. The ground cracked from where her feet pushed off from and only the barest of afterimages could be discerned from the masters eyes. A thrust there a wide slash there...soon enough the ground was cracked in numerous places and the grass flattened completely as Achilles reappeared where she had been standing a few moments before with a satisfied smile on her face. It took a second to get used to but that definitely helps. Even I almost lost my spear on the first spin there. She said with a slight chuckle as she faced her master. Since she prided herself on being the fastest hero these spells that simply increased that were perfect for her. She rested the bottom of her spear into the ground as she looked on curiously as her master began chanting once again. This time the light seemed brighter and Achilles could feel the mana welling up as the spell continued on. Finally as it finished and the spell activated Achilles eyes widened at the sudden surge of power. It was difficult to even stay still since she could tell that even the most minute of moves would send her streaking away. She readied herself and touched off lightly against the ground while leaning forwards and before she knew it the wall on the opposite side of the yard loomed directly in front of her. Even Achilles used to quick movement as she was was startled slightly and quickly jumped before she rammed into the wall. Suddenly she was alone in the air and looking down her master was but a speck on the ground and the house wasnt much larger. She let out a laugh as her upwards momentum lessened and she eventually began falling back to the ground with her hair snapping in the wind around her. Her trip down took longer than her trip upwards but after a few seconds of free fall she landed lightly on the top of the wall with bent knees. From there she propelled herself forwards and down slightly to pass by where her spear was still stuck in the ground where she had left it. Reaching out with her left hand and grabbed it as she rocketed by and dug her heels into the ground to slow her movement. Before she even came to a complete stop she once again imagine the enemy army before her and streaked through their ranks while felling them one by one. Just as she cut down the last one the light faded and Achilles began breathing heavily somewhat. She could feel her body return to normal and she cast a quick glance at her master to confirm that the spell was done. All of the spells youve shown me thus far would be more than helpful in battle. Maybe try to limit it to the first two as much as possible and only use the last if its necessary. The first rule of war that I learned is to conserve energy as much as possible. If you use everything to defeat the first enemy the second will cut you down that much easier.,FSRP,d2gu4ye,1,t5_3e301
