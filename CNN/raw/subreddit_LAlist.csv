Also be aware that just clamping a camera to the tail of a plane will shift its COG a lot. One ounce is a lot to a plane that only ways  or  pounds.  It may be better to hang it under the center of the wing and crop out the plane from the field of view.

11233735,0,t1_dezgdqr,Healthcare should be accessible to all.  The question is how to pay for it.  Insurance companies profit from a centralized health care system where choice is taken away from the people.  People should not be forced by law to pay into into a onesizefitsall system. Insurance companies lobby Congress to pass laws that favor the insurance companies.  Someone has to stand up in Congress and demand that the people are protected from abuse of insurance companies. A robust health care insurance system requires competition across state lines.Insurance companies should be forced to provide for the indigent and for those with preexisting conditions.,LAlist,df5bu78,1,t5_2thka
