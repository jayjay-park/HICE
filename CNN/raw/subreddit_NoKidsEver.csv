1381512,0,t3_290o6y,Its how our economy is set up. It requires a growing consumer base and a growing labor pool. Therefore its in the interest of business and government to encourage the next generation to be larger than the previous one.This is at odds with two realities that are only getting more harsh as time goes on scarcity. The planet is finite. In order to feed the people we have now we basically have to rape the planet. Billions of livestock animals never see the light of day we have to poison the planet in order to coax enough food out and despite doing all that millions still go hungry.The other is the need for labor is decreasing. Automation is moving toward a point where work will be obsolete. We no longer need the gigantic labor forces we did just  years ago. Its only going to get worse and we are already suffering for it.With those two big problems looming I think its a little insane to doubledown on population growth.,NoKidsEver,cipgg6g,3,t5_2wtw4
