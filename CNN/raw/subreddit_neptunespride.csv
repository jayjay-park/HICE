2973604,0,t3_2u74sm,Should i get the first or second installment?    Second. See         Is it pay to win?    Nope but premium players can join more than  games at once can rename stars and have more race options.        What is the best noob race?    The races have no impact whatsoever its more of a roleplaying thing.        Does it end up being busywork like travian?    On the contrary it can quickly become an obsession if youre not careful.        Does anyone want to play it with me?    Probably.        Can i join anyone game?    If they send you a link. Otherwise just visit the join screen to pick one.        Will i suck at the game for a long period of time?    The basic rules are pretty easy to grasp. The strategy is up to you however.        If i get NP should i pay for subscription?     Play some for free first to see if you like it. If you do becoming a premium player is a great way to support Neptunes Pride.,neptunespride,co644gt,5,t5_2sd1f

4294714,0,t1_cs9o8yg,Ok thanks.In my opinion banking is better than terraforming early game because you downright gain money while terraforming depends kinda on how many planets you have and you have more planets in the end sooo.... ,neptunespride,cs9qj0r,3,t5_2sd1f
