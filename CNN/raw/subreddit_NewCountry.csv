This means posts that either have a lot of upvotescomments or are rising in both. Therefore if you post something that has quick involvement upvotes and comments shortly after its posted it will show up in the frontpage of the subscribers. If you post it but the comments and upvotes comme after a while it wont show up in the frontpage.,NewCountry,cfyoq1d,1,t5_2vro3

615708,0,t3_216ugo,I like Florida Georgia Line but I understand why some people dont. Theyre conforming to what the new country fans like to hear. Kind of like what Luke Bryan and Tim McGraw are doing.,NewCountry,cga99ti,3,t5_2vro3
652924,0,t3_21mjid,I prefer the Riser version some of the stuff going on in the background on the EP version just sounds off to me. The two versions are pretty similar though,NewCountry,cgehjqt,1,t5_2vro3

925793,0,t3_24p650,I like it the song Im a huge fan of Brad Paisley and this is typical of his style so thats not surprising. But these textbased videos are really overdone.,NewCountry,ch9inbk,1,t5_2vro3
952587,0,t3_24zcnj,Cool vid. My group has been in the RV resort the last  years but Im thinking we should try the rented house scene next year. Ive just never wanted to deal with coming and going from the venue. ,NewCountry,chckfjk,1,t5_2vro3
1034404,0,t1_chlu6jb,Eric gave in to pop radio? Check out some of his interviews where he talks about the album and you will think otherwise. Eric is one country artist that has never written anything that he didnt believe in. ,NewCountry,chlv7fd,1,t5_2vro3

1259033,0,t1_cib8t9m,I just started listening to his album this week and its been almost the only thing Ive listened to. I dont know why I never gave him a chance other than his radio hits. He has some great songs!,NewCountry,cib98r7,2,t5_2vro3
2083859,0,t1_cl409k9,Try out some early Gary Allan. Maybe pick up his greatest hits album since it covers his transition to a more edgy sound. I dont care for his newer albums but his early stuff might take you somewhere.  If Songs About Rain doesnt move you than pass on it.  The TXOK suggestions are correct. Also look into Jamey Johnson if you want to hear something close to real country.,NewCountry,cl4pcxy,1,t5_2vro3
2211190,0,t1_clkw3a1,Would you say most of the other songs would outdo Ex To See? I loved most of the preorder songs Raised On It House Party and Leave The Night On but that and to a lesser extent Break Up In A Small Town just made me shudder.Ninjaedit AND ITS MY CAKEDAY LOL,NewCountry,clkw9cv,1,t5_2vro3

3318795,0,t1_cp6j1zz,Youre probably right.  But every time I hear him sing about drinking whiskey out of the bottle around the bonfire I just envision hes sitting on the tailgate with a good looking woman with her arms round him down a dirt road next to a creek.  On a Friday night.So yeah Im likely stretching Homegrown as brocountry.  But Country Fried is quintessential bro.,NewCountry,cp6kkcz,1,t5_2vro3
3324810,0,t3_2y3v4j,Also going on tour again September rd in Toronto!Saw them last year and HOLY CRAP they are the best live band ever.

5414465,0,t3_3p3zhu,A little surprised it isnt his collab with Thomas Rhett so they can end with it on their tour and it make sense plus its a kick ass song.This song is probably my second favourite on the album so Im happy to hear this.,NewCountry,cw3r93y,3,t5_2vro3

5662939,0,t1_cwyzxbh,Right. And even if I do think its shit I dont go around saying it because thats pretty insulting to people who do like it. Im not one to get offended over much but for some reason I get personally insulted when people insult country music. It makes me feel like they are telling me my tastes are shit.,NewCountry,cwz1jlu,-1,t5_2vro3

9506822,0,t1_d9kot9a,I find the majority of them to sound horrible live. So no not vocally talented. Most of them dont even sound good on the damn radio. Just pretty faces that have rhythm on stage. ,NewCountry,d9kx2si,1,t5_2vro3
