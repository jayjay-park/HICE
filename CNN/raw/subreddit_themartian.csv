4226433,0,t3_39ajy1,Seveneves by Stephenson is hard scifi that goes speculative for its cause and its third act.  The world is insanely massive in size cast and time.  Its epic along the lines of Lord of the Rings.I enjoyed it but I made the mistake of getting it on audio book.  This is one of those Id rather have read on paper or eInk it requires focus as the names and situations come flying at you.,themartian,cs1znwk,9,t5_3467f
4263225,0,t1_cs5wxlt,The RTG hot tub was one of my favorite parts of the book not because it was dramatic just because thats a hilarious image. Especially your commentary about how NASA would shit its pants. ,themartian,cs66mf5,8,t5_3467f

It is a humorous look at life death and immortality in the near future. It is a semifinalist in the  Kindle Book Awards. Totally worth checking out. ,themartian,csw72nr,1,t5_3467f
4488369,0,t3_3cjscm,The HAB is a lot bigger than Id pictured it to be.  Same for the rovers.  In the books he mentions how cramped the rovers are a couple times and how he had a hard time putting the batteries in there.  The rovers in the movie seem massive.,themartian,cswf620,4,t5_3467f

5255450,0,t3_3mzitt,Im going to mark my post as a spoiler just incase but its not really a spoiler Im just answering your question based on seeing the film.It definitely does dumb things down there is no better way to say that. Theres probably less than  of the mathsscience stuff that was in the book. I knew they wouldnt keep all of it but I was hoping for a little more than what we saw. Still though the film was excellent and in the grand scheme of things a pretty faithful adaptation. spoiler,themartian,cvjgx8v,3,t5_3467f

5287065,0,t1_cvmmtqi,Yep. Which is exactly why I feel they went with the badass duct tape helmet job instead of the glove. Established and kept the suspense up. ,themartian,cvnhglc,1,t5_3467f

5321424,0,t1_cvqhgqo,gtHas Hollywood ever produced a properly cramped spaceship outside of Apollo ?The interior of Interstellars Endurance wasnt too bad.

5344099,0,t1_cvupful,Come to think of it maybe it would make more sense to land the next missions MAV as the last thing you do before returning to Earth rather than the first thing you do when you show up just in case you need the MAV as a rescue ship for an abort or even to replace a damaged MAV at the mission site. Though I guess its use as a rescue ship depends on how many weeksmonthsyears it takes for it to make enough fuel for launch.,themartian,cvuro0i,3,t5_3467f
5368142,0,t1_cvxcbz8,The Ares  MAV would have landed autonomously. Plenty of probes have done powered soft landings of one form or another.The Hermesintheloop landings that the subsequent MAVs did would be the preferred method once they became available able to put modules closer together on the surface and less likely to lose a vehicle but every MAV would have the autonomouslanding software in case something went wrong or Hermes had to abort before the MAV landing.,themartian,cvxu9ma,2,t5_3467f

5749476,0,t1_cx9klt2,They did a very bad job at making it seem like Watney was in any danger and I pretty much knew how the movie was gonna end from the start. If he died at the end that wouldve been really interesting.Favorite scene? Right before he launched off at the end and was tearing up. That was actually really well done compared to everything else.,themartian,cx9s13v,-13,t5_3467f

6093132,0,t1_cy9mpsm,You know you just made me realize something. If Mark made it the  years someone was going to have to be scrubbed from the Ares  crew technically they all did in the end but still makes you wonder if that crew would have argued over who got dropped.,themartian,cyi85mt,1,t5_3467f

6611607,0,t3_46803g,Since Mark obviously didnt die when his suit was breached its probably safe to say the suit never fully depressurized. And even if the air in the suit and hab is scrubbed for bacteria Mark and his crew mates are still covered in all sorts of microbial life. Id imagine the interior of an EVA suit can get pretty ripe so if any fabric got pulled into the wound by the antenna antibiotics seem like a smart move. Same goes for anything living on the surface of Marks skin that got pulled into the wound. In the end it also comes down to why wouldnt he take antibiotics if theyre available? If youre in his situation the last thing you need is a massive internal infection or something. He had all the medical supplies for the rest of the crew so sparing some antibiotics was probably the pertinent thing to do. Good question though!,themartian,d0372i8,16,t5_3467f

7713413,0,t3_4ji7xf,Adam Savage got ahold of the one of the original prop suits from the movies. Hes in the process if replicating one for himself and he posted a video of them disassembling it. You can clearly see that the helmet was enclosed by the chest and back pieces which would have been the life support. Unlike the current Eva suits which are fully pressurized and have a self contained environment throughout the suit this suit looks like its just the Helmet that has the artificial atmosphere and the rest of the suit is just a barrier.
