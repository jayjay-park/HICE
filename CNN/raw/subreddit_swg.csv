Anyway   the quote from Freeh was in relation to Operation Cyber Loss which focused on fraud schemes targeted are those involving online auction fraud systemic nondelivery of merchandise purchased over the Internet creditdebit card fraud bank fraud investment fraud multilevel marketing and PonziPyramid schemes.

The issue with Reborn is it is using the code the was taken off the SOE servers. But in all reality it comes down to the version of the game you want to play. I never played live but before I started playing I researched the game and figured out the the precunge version was the one I wanted to play because it gives the most freedom to the class system that I wanted.

5606836,0,t3_3rwsk8,If I were you Id try both Basilisk SWGEmu for a little while and Test Center  SWG Reborn for a little while and get an idea of what type of game is more up your ally. The latter of which is a test server which means there are testing tools available and the server will be wiped someday for a permanent server but its the most complete option to play similar to the game when it shut down.The two main camps for the game are preCU before a patch called the Combat Upgrade and the game as it was close to when it closed after a patch called New Game Enhancements or NGE. Theres tons and tons of differences both in how you build your characters the amount and types of content and how player interdependence is handled. Basically the preCU version is very sandboxy in good ways and bad ways and the postNGE is more streamlined in my opinion also in good ways or bad ways.Take some time try out both for yourself try to hear from some other people although try not to let both sides biases overwhelm you and see what is more appealing to you in the long run.,swg,cws2yuw,3,t5_2srtt
