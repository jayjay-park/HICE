133722,0,t3_1vlg0h,My list in no particular order Make it so the tomahawk explosion is the same one that the BLP makes. This means its only a finisher or you need a direct hit to kill. Buff the CR. Its still really weak. Either improve the recoil or make its firerate the same as the Heavy Pistol. Make it so people hit by the AMR can get revived then add explosive elemental ammo to the AMR which would prevent reviving but reduce damage to   of its regular . Make it so incendiary ammo cannot take a weapon beyond the normal damage cap. Buff electric ammo. Make it do double or more to electronics. New Siege maps. Fix team balance. Far too often I find that its one really good player being forced to carry a mediocre team against a team of decent players. This almost always ends the same way. Add a new silenced damage muzzle. We have the Copperhead already but its the only one. A silencer that has at least the normal damage would be great.,Blacklight,cetnshn,3,t5_2t21j

After all these years its still inherently the same game. I think the fact that CS has remained so unchanged in all of these years yet retains a huge player population is testament to CS being a true classic. Blacklight on the other hand could have been a classic. More love from the developers and a better publisher could have changed its fate. For now though Blacklight is doomed to fade into obscurity.

The best way to get more exp is to simply be better at the game more kills headshots and killing sprees means more exp per game.Of course thats not really helpful advice. The only feasible way to get more xp per game is to play game modes that reward extra CP. Personally I recommend domination  xp for hacking a node and  bonus xp per kill against enemies standing next to their node or if youre standing next to a friendly node. If camping is feasible you could just hunker down and defend a node getting double xp for every kill. Just beware of nades.,Blacklight,cuz0kxx,5,t5_2t21j

I will add my two cents here since you cant remove my post here I think. I would spend money in the old game to have a private server to remove the HRV and tweak some things that Ifriends did not like. Granted it was  a month but there were a lot of us that did that. Now private matches are a joke can only invite people in and if you miss the invite there is no chat to say hey resend it.  I used to play nightly with Kat Lt Guts Dildo and about  other friends nightly! I go on now once a week or so just to try to catch people and now instead of  friends on I see . So is the game tanking in my opinion YEP. So you can just keep ignoring us and think we are the minority of people that play your game. But there are more people in this forum than playing right now.  So dont worry I am sure that pretty soon most of us who keep holding in there waiting for you to hear us will eventually fade away just like the game.,Blacklight,czodty6,4,t5_2t21j

It will still be  shots to kill both the Rhino k start HP and Gunman k start HP hardsuits but even WITH the repair tool itd make the rhino  shots at full health which is OK if you consider the repairtool users are giving up their tac gear to heal up hardsuits.On the other hand the Stinger rocket deals k damage on hardsuits...

Even if someone was serious what good does it do by complaining on a subreddit? what do you want us to do about it? ban him? chop his head off and put it on a dish for you? Realizing that the internet is a privileged taken for granted by many that may or may not be very well educated.

Just go to the directoryCProgram FilessteamsteamappscommonblacklightretributionFoxGameConfigPCConsoleCookedAnd open the FoxSystemSettings.ini file. Then look for AllowDDTrue and change it to AllowDDFalse. It should be the tenth line down. Save it and relaunch Blacklight Retribution and never go DirectX I guess...I just tried coming back to this game since I havent played it in a long time and...
