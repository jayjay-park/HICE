11724001,0,t1_dgoxko6,I kinda wouldnt mind seeing the darkness only be restricted by the damage instead of long rest. d dmg without restriction might not be enough but Im not sure. Maybe either can do it again after a short or long rest OR maybe damage the first time and then exhaustion level each additional until you take a long rest?I like the idea that you use blood magic in an emergency and have that riskreward element so you continue to drain yourself but could suffer consequences if you do it too much.Though if you did that it might be a tradition all to itself where you keep adding spells to that mechanic as you level up so that you start with say... darkness then at th you can do a stronger spell then at th another etc. But after the first time you stack exhaustion or something.Anyway dont want to confuse the issue just musings.,TheLunarSanctum,dgoy256,2,t5_3k4sb
