8017891,0,t1_d4h8smo,Well I would probably want to run a ton of simulations in parallel or at least have different parameters to tune that could produce interesting results. If you look at a game like say Binding of Isaac each new game is in a random and unique universe. This universe is procedurally generated based on a randomly generated seed value. In fact you can copy that seed value send it to a friend and have them play the same world as you. Similarly I think itd be interesting if the fine structure constant sorry I was distracted in my earlier reply and talked about the cosmological constant instead what I meant was this   were the seed value for our particular universe. In ours it happens to be . but tweaking that number would lead to vastly different universes.,AWLIAS,d4haa9c,2,t5_2vmwn

8721007,0,t1_d6vnm3q,Allow me to abbreviate your answers so I save others from the pain of trying to understand you. Take the effort I made my own pain and the time I lost as a sign of respect.gtDo you feel like you live in a loop? YesgtDo you face the same challenges over and over? YesgtAre the challenges easy enough so you dont kill yourself out of unbearable pain but hard enough so you dont kill yourself out of boredom and emptiness?YesgtHow has your life experience changed after considering the fact of this being a simulation? It hasnt changed anything. Youve been skeptical of your own life and life experience thats why you were attracted to the SH idea just to reject the idea of the SH having an impact in your life experience immediately after I asked you. You believe incongruities in your inner mental process are irrelevant but published physics papers are relevant to the simulation. Youve come to a point where you arent sure of anything you say and yet you blindly believe your own reasonings I believe you believe them like a religion at the same time you accuse me of following a religious pattern just because I talk about the importance of being aware. I only have a question for you if everything you said may or may not be like you say it is wouldnt be arrogant to assume that if you dont know something no one else does?,AWLIAS,d6vrlyt,1,t5_2vmwn
10062020,0,t1_dbj3f57,haha my fellow sim theory enthusiast we can go deeper! What if in just the same way we can skip through a youtube video to get to the good part the higher powers are able to fast forward through the eons of history that precedes the human race? As for the billions of light years that continue to expand and are seemingly wasted What if they dont use processing power until we get theresee it. Im not sure if my last point is going across but what if its just empty space? dark matter anti matter we. until we get there that is and it renders...Alas you are correct my perspective is an optimistic human one one where I like to think we are more important that it seems.As for trolling.. Im not sure how I will go about it but Elons a good role model imo. Hes bringing awareness to the masses,AWLIAS,dbj3t0n,1,t5_2vmwn
10238270,0,t3_5mlge8,if  is the case then the device thats simulating our universe must be incredibly powerful. however the purpose of the simulation would be relatively simple what does physics X in a space of size Y do over time? within this option there are variations.  a the programmers only know the physics not what it can lead to unlikely.  b the programmers know about matter and stars and chemistry to some extent.  c the programmers know about biological life or some other form perhaps and want it to emerge so they can see what happens.  d the programmers know specifically about biological life and want it to evolve to a level of sentience whatever the species may be.  e the programmers already know about human sentient life as well as how to set up a quantum level simulation to generate it from scratch all for the purpose of observing humans.  f the programmers already know about this exact timeline of humanity and how to generate it from quantum physics and a big bang. for what purpose? fun? this option would be much more easily achieved from a recording of the particular history in question. meaning wed be a rerun of some first run of our universe. of course the programmers also could have put a time travel option into the simulation in some form and were another instance of the originally running universe from some point in its past connected now as a parallel universe! if  is the case then our apparent galactic and stellar and geological and evolutionary histories would have to have been fabricated. in fact any light from anywhere not being consciously observed in the universe could never reach us because it could never be created in the first place since the source wouldnt exist until observed. far away things would simply not be there making light until looked at and then the light would take time to reach us. still how would the thing even know to start being simulated? for anything to happen in the simulation then a conscious presence would always have to be somewhere some sort of conscious monitoring program or perhaps at least one user logged in since it started simultaneously looking at most of the universe somehow. otherwise unconscious simulated matter could never evolve into conscious life since nothing would have been around to observe it so that it could exist and evolve consciousness. the very material that moment to moment generates consciousness in the simulation would first have to be consciously observed before it could exist and so behave consciously. the source of the consciousness is in question here. is it emerging from interactions within the simulated materials? or is it based somewhere deeper than the simulation and is merely logged in like the matrix? a simulation by conscious observance seems like a possible option for logging in though still not too great and less so for evolving life. if  is the case then everything is definitely a lie. this could be in the form of experiment or entertainment but our reality would not be like what it seems. the degree to which this lie is centered on you is also variable. are you just another conscious NPC of sorts? are you part of some entitys plans somehow? are you the main character?! this is at least a less lonely option than the  suboptions. the possibilities span from being unthinkably alone to being infinitely lied to.also how does the universe simulating us fit into the universe simulating it? on and on... deeper and deeper older and older. thats an even harder situation to imagine.,AWLIAS,dc4kcqp,7,t5_2vmwn
