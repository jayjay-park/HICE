8237733,0,t1_d5708bp,It was really memorable especially Kaena Point a bumpy experience riding the Leeward side my first time! and the wonderful food at the end so much tasty pizza pasta salad. Lots of friendly people too. My new role model is the guy who rode all the way on his pennyfarthing even took it around Kaena Pt. He arrived very late but after arriving did pushups to prove hes still fit!,bicyclehawaii,d579te5,1,t5_38tgs
