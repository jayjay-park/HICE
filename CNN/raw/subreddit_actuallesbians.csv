164280,0,t1_cewlu7r,gt its not until they are making me uncomfortable that I have no idea how to stop it.I can relate to this so much and all I can say is that you need to learn how to establish boundaries. For me this meant setting hard rules for myself prior to situations so that I wouldnt be swayed into an uncomfortable one. Basically just think of all the situations youve been in where a guy crossed the line and try to figure out what exactly happened that made you feel uncomfortable. My problem is always that I ignore my gut feeling and think that to express my actual UGH GROSS GET AWAY feelings would be too harsh. And sure if I actually said that it would be. But the fact that I feel that way is not something that should be ignored. Our feelings matter ya know? So dont just try and ignore them to protect some guys ego or whatever. Its a hard lesson to learn but believe me Ive put myself in some super shitty situations because I didnt give myself enough credit. Some of my hard rules Never give out my phone number even if they pretend they just want it as a friend never allow guys to sleep on my couch once again even if they mask it as being a friend never go anywhere privateenclosed with a guy I dont know never accept a drink from a guy etc... They sound so stupidly simple but in application with someone trying really hard to influence you when you have boundary issues it gets sort of muddled. ,actuallesbians,cex56ww,2,t5_2rch0

Remind yourself of the reasons why you are in a relationship. Does your girl make you happy? Do you get that smile when shes around? Remember that although commitment might be scary this relationship isnt scary. Dont freak out and dump her just to get away from it.Secondly you have got to sit down and communicate with her that you are just not ready for anything like engagement or that type of longterm planning. That you like her you love her fine if you wanna say it and mean it and she makes you happy but you arent ready to sign up for anything yet. You can tell her commitment like engagement is a big serious step and that frankly it makes you nervous. That you want to spend time in the relationship and feel it deepen and evolve before you see if you are ready for commitment.best of luck.,actuallesbians,cfuga1e,2,t5_2rch0

621351,0,t1_cgatwip,Of course! I myself am currently very out and proud but I understand that thats not everyones cup of tea. Honestly its hard to say because I dont know your situation but if your parents are super homophobic I would advise to wait until youre financially independent to come out to them which sucks. If you do decide to come out to them with parents all you can really do is sit them down and confidently tell them. You may have to answer their questions but if you do so patiently and maturely you should be fine. I always just tell myself that I need to be brave for like  seconds and then its done. As for friends Ive found that its typically easier to come out to them because you can mention more offhand that you like a girl or are gay and they will typically be more chill Again just my experience. On the flip side some high schoolers can be weird about things. Coming out is super nerve wracking at first but the more you do it the easier it gets I promise! Just take a deep breath and take the plunge. Unfortunately there isnt always another way I personally find letters to impersonal for things like this but some people prefer them.

I didnt read it. I put her phone back. Calmly rubbed her back to wake her up and mentioned that while checking the time I saw a text from her ex but hadnt read anything. Is there anything to be worried about? She laughed and said no way baby We were drunk texting each other last night about stupid stuff. Not anything to be worried about. She showed me. And honestly it was a very boring thread of texts about stuff I dont care about. I learned that girls can be friends with girls without being into them. And it was way better to just be real and ask her. At the end of the day were in the same bed. Shes spending her life with me for a reason. tldr Just ask her about her concerns in a non confrontational way.

720808,0,t1_cgm1vdy,Im sorry but that argument seems so dumb to me. People who think that way seem insecure to me. If I leave the relationship and then date a guy afterwards it should be sad but only because the relationship is over. That doesnt somehow invalidate my sexuality because I date a guy next. I know that you cant control your feelings or whatever but that just seems really icky to me. Just because I like guys doesnt mean that I wont like you.Sorry if it seems like Im attacking you Im not. Im just done with this queererthanthou biphobic bullshit that I see getting spewed in a lot of circles. If you fall for me and I fall for you and we work together in a practical sense who cares what each persons sexuality is? If our relationship is on the rocks because of something so trivial as the genitals of the person I last dated then this relationship simply isnt worth my time. And of course Im not saying that past relationships arent important thats not true. If a person is a shitty abusive asshole in past relationships you should probably be wary of them. And you could also make the argument that its not like a shared experience or whatever but I also dont buy that. Youre not going to be able to connect on every layer on everything in a relationship.

746990,0,t3_22p01u,I think she was done with the relationship before you guys even broke up. Thats why she is in love with that guy in what looks to you like she did it in a heartbeat. I take it This is ur first youremyfirstlesbian girl youve been with...dont take it too hard it happens most of them arent even sure what they want. When youre dating someone you shouldnt be their little experiment and if you are gonna be it then remember to keep your feelings safe guarded. Im not hating on bisexual or bi curious people cause to each its own but they are just not reliable dating material. Maybe Im little biased about this because I kinda went thru the same shit.   If someone is no longer good to your sanity and love experience cut them off keep track if you want just dont engage with her. There a plenty of women out there. And believe me she wont be the last girl you talk bout marriage and kids with. Also next time dont rush things women are emotional so emotions tend to run wild..almost every longterm lesbian relationship theres talks bout marriage and kidsdogs. Seriously dont rush things..get to know someone for a good   yrs before talking about making huge decisions as marriage. Gaystraightbi and anything else you gotta know the person for a long time to make a long commitment like that. Im guessing youre not anywhere near your s or s take your time. I was with my ex for  yrs we even had domestic partnership and well now she my ex and my new gf I wouldnt dare rush things imma just enjoy my time with her.Edit if youre downvoting something I wrote based on my opinion youre stupid.

From what i gather he dates petit asian women while my princess prefers tall girls. If there is anything bad to having a raptor twin sister people automatically assume he is gay. When i told my sister about him the first question she asked was about his sexuality. And most of my friends were curious about his orientation.

1024725,0,t3_25t1k9,I may not give the best advice but I was in your situation months ago. I tried to make it work but I just couldnt feel it anymore. I did A LOT of extra hours at work we didnt had sex for months. I felt like I was just a robot. We were in a rut. She said she loves me everyday but I was just not in it anymore. We were together for almost  years when I finally broke it off.    This may sound selfish but if youve tried everything you could but it is just not there then it would be best to just let go. She deserves someone to love her back as much. If you think youre not the one for her someone else is. Shes gonna get hurt of course but you just have to woman up for it.    It wasnt easy for me at first. There are times I wanted to get back with her and I knew she would take me back in a heartbeat but I didnt. Loneliness kicks in once in a while but that is exactly what I need now. Been single for more than  months now and Im happy.    I hope it works out for you.

Would she introduce you as her menstruating daughter? Her vaccinated daughter? Its not like bragging about an accomplishment. I can see my A daughter or my trophywinning daughter but being gay is just something you are. Id probably let the tshirt go though.

1080475,0,t3_26hhlc,I think this might be a case of differing visibility in outcomes and possibly a touch of confirmation bias.  When a couple displays the outward signs of healthy and happy love they tend to be much subtler than the outward signs of toxic insincere love.  You can hear a spirited argument from a distance but you have to listen carefully to see the kind of banter I generally associate with the best relationships.  As for whether I believe in love or not I do.  Ive never been in love but I had the privilege of watching my parents and the privilege of having parents who were very much in love.  I think its much rarer than the media would tell you it is and that its much more work than anyone wants to admit but I think it exists surely.,actuallesbians,chr3pqw,9,t5_2rch0

I have had no burgeoning sexuality phase because nothing has changed so we go to the same places and parties full of straight people and for some reason my school seems to only have gay guys I cannot find the lesbians.  But I agree with you on wanting to test out your attraction to women on your own time without having to report to your friends about it.  If I wanted them to my friends would love to go out with me and try to help me pick up a girl but thats an insane amount of pressure and I would be embarrassed.  And they would want to hear all about it afterwards.If youre in a good place for it urban area or whatever maybe just try to go to a couple gay bars by yourself?  Thats pretty low pressure its clear youre not there in a group of straight girls looking to have fun without getting hit on and even if nothing happens theres no loss.  Buy a girl a drink or go dance and no one will judge you if it doesnt work out.  That seems like the best place to go where there will be a decent number of other lesbians which makes it a lot easier to test out the waters for a beginner as opposed to say approaching a random cute girl on the street.  You could always do that too I just personally dont have the balls for it  ,actuallesbians,ci8l03y,2,t5_2rch0

They were the boy crazy types the asexual types and then there were the lesbians.I think I knew when I was about  and I say  cos thats when my earliest memories were. I fell in love with a girl from my class who was a minor celebrity and had been on some educational TV shows. She was smart and pretty and sweet. Id think about her all the time and wanted to spend all my time with her. I got jealous when other girls tried to get close to her. I didnt know it at that time because I didnt even know what lesbians were at that time or that girl loving girls was possible. That and I grew up in a country where being gay was illegal so I tried to suppress it all.I moved onto a mixed school discovered boys spent lots of time in denial and started dating them almost exclusively for the next  years. It didnt work out with guys something was just off and I would bore of them really quickly or small things about them would put me off.

1396691,0,t1_cirbigo,Im not sure what churches youve been to or if you ever have been to any but thats not everybodys experience with religions. It being in spite of religion is bs. With the exception of the Baptist church I have never been a target for hatred based on my sexuality. Actual practicing Christians are taught to LOVE all equally and to treat each other with kindness. I have never been taught in the church I attend that everybody else is wrong about anything. I realize not all of us have been fortunate enough to have supporting communities that I have. However you making such a blanket statement is socially irresponsible to me so I choose to address it. I dont disagree with the fact that a lot of followers of the Abrahmic have a lot of growing to do because we certainly do. But to sit there and pass judgment against whole groups of people for passing judgment is kind of silly.Religion plays a lot bigger role in some peoples lives than the issue of sexuality. For some people it can lead to a feeling of purpose or feeling like it enriches their lives. To bash a whole group of people based on the actions of ignorance is just as ignorant. The way I interpreted your original statement was perhaps misguided and I see your point but I also think its a little black and white. Peoples religious and spiritual beliefs are generally a lot more complicated than it simply being us vs. Everybody else. In my opinion its exactly that attitude on both sides that cause most of the tension. As a Christian and one who has seen actual fellowship without any judgment on either side...I guess I just want to see it like that everywhere. I know that is naive and Im in no way a bible thumperI just believe theres more to religion than the whole homosexuality debate and want others to see that too.Time for bed though.

We are different in how we define the human experience.  Telling us that we should accept each other because were the same only erases our diversity and panders both to the socially ingrained fear of otherness and desire to sort people into ingroups and outgroups in order to make ourselves feel more comfortable with our own experiences and choices. Being told to accept others in spite of and because of their differences is initially scary because it forces us to acknowledge that a experiences and identities are NOT uniform and b others deserve equal treatment and have inherent worth even though their identitiesexperiences are incredibly different and oftentimes contradictory to our own.

Saying that you only like women while being married to a man is certainly not the way you express a gender and sexual identity that is selfadmittedly so complicated. It just invites criticism and the pansexualbisexual crowd as well as the trans crowd has enough on its plate trying to explain itself to people on both sides of the sexuality spectrum. ,actuallesbians,cjdk1dc,5,t5_2rch0
1574008,0,t3_2c61iz,I was  and I had a friend a year above me who i was going to go to her prom with. Just as friends but then a boy in her grade asked her just like  or  days before prom itself. I already had my dress picked out and everything and I was really upset. Not because I liked her because she really was just my best friend but because I felt like a second choice and that sucked. I totally understand why she said yes to him and I dont blame her for it at all. Anyway so she had just told me this and it took a bit to hit me but eventually I ended up in a practice room during lunch playing piano by myself and the song I was playing was really emotional and I had a full fledged breakdown and starting sobbing and just all out ugly crying. It was about prom but it was also just the built up stress of having to hide such a big secret from my parents so I called them and asked if I could go home early. I never ask to do that so they let me and I spent the rest of the day crying in bed. My mom came home and asked what was wrong with me and I knew I had to tell her. I was crying so so so so so so so so hard but I knew I needed to tell her. She started getting frustrated because it looked like I was going to start saying something but I kept chickening out. Eventually I calmed down and we were talking about one of my teachers who just got married and we were talking about keeping your name when you get married and she asked me if I would keep my last name. I said I didnt think I would get married and she asked why not and I said because I didnt like boys. And then I started crying again and she just hugged me and said that I would still be able to get married some day. All and all it went well. I guess I just came out when I knew I couldnt keep it in any more. ,actuallesbians,cjdkrc4,3,t5_2rch0

Go here for chatting with other people  theyre generally friendly. It gets pretty packed on the weekends so try to go on the earlier side.As far as lesbian clubs go they dont really exist.

In the small town my university is in Im  out my grandmother lives here and she doesnt know and its amazing. It makes going back home to the city Im from difficult only one parent knows and no one else.Being out at school makes this town feel like mine and Ive been able to grow and experience things I would have missed out on had I decided to treat every new situation like I was back home monitored by political bullshit related to parents and others opinions.College is the perfect place to be you. I hope you have a great time. College is amazing and the most difficult thing ever but Ive never loved an experience as much as this. Everyone Ive made a part of my life is so supportive and Im not sure Ive met anyone to not be cool with the gay thing. And my school is in the middle of Kansas! So youll find people trust me.Good luck and work hard. ,actuallesbians,cjyvhsm,2,t5_2rch0

1780734,0,t3_2eufxk,Okay my confession time  My previous relationship was poly. my ex and her partner were poly and they were fairly open about it. My exs partner had some social issue so we went to extract her and all of us spent the evening together. There were lot of cuddling involved with my ex laying down on my lap while her other partner caressed her thighs. After my ex fell into a slumber her partner approached me alone and asked how i was feeling. She sensed my silence during their conversation and explained to me that she isnt my enemy. At which point i cried in her arms and told her how i felt unwanted  inadequate and not being paid any attention. nevertheless after all the long efforts the relationship had to break in the end. Developed selfesteem issue in the end and need a few months of therapy and medication. These days I cheer people who are succesfull with poly relationships  in the lgbt scenario but personally learnt its not my cup of tea. ,actuallesbians,ck3m69m,2,t5_2rch0

1795006,0,t3_2f1y5b,The feeling goes away when you actively try to accept yourself because thats what you want right? Your post really resonates with me because for over two years I struggled with the same and guilt and worry over being a lesbian. Why me? Why do I have to be weird. But here I am today still lesbian and I love it. I started out feeling so unexperienced never really even seeing a girl that way and even if I did I brushed it off as well just that one girl is really pretty and cool. But you know that deep down you wish you could kiss her. Hold her hand. Stroke her arm to comfort her. Youll never move on from denying your feelings and youll never get past the shame until you actively try and accept who you are. You cant run from it trust me Ive tried. Its too ingrained in your psyche and youll only end up miserable. These are the steps I took that Im going to generalize a little bit to maybe help you better. You dont have to do these in this order but this is the order I did them in.. This is cheesy but necessary Look yourself in the mirror and say I am a lesbian. Over and over. And over again until it sticks. This is apart of your identity. It doesnt define you but you avoiding your association to this word has an impact. You may feel silly but trust me. You need to see the person in the mirror as a lesbian.. Surround yourself with the community. It sounds like youve already done this and have gay friends. But its also different being out with them and still being their friend. And I hope you try and stay friends with them because when I came out I flirted with EVERYBODY and now that Ive got a girl over the summer and I came back to a school where all the other lesbians avoid me. Im working on that personally but trust me. Only flirt with a few you really like.. Remember that the end goal is to be in a fun loving relationship. It sounds like youre at a great start by having loads of gay friends. Awesome! Id encourage you to try and be in a relationship whether friendly friends with benefits open relationship whatever your style and ifwhen it ends badly find the courage to pick yourself back up and start again. And you have to not punish new people in your life because of someone that hurt you in the past. Set it into your mind that if you like a girl its ok to go after her. You have to allow yourself this. You have to allow yourself to love another girl. It cant be something you lock up anymore. Its time to share it with another special girl. And keep trying. If down the road you find youve been dating this girl and its just not working allow yourself time to get over her and move on. . This is all a learning process and you have to be patient and respectful of that. I feel like discovering youre a lesbian is like seeing a painting. You can obviously see it the colors and shapes that it has on it but you have no idea how to interpret it because its an abstract painting. There will be people that will come into your life point at it and tell you this is what this painting means to me. And another person will come into your life and say this is what it means to me. And when I say come into your life and telling you what it means thats a metaphor for being in a relationship with them. Maybe you understand some bits of what theyre telling you and some parts dont resinate with you so you keep what makes sense and move on. Slowly over time youll come to understand what that painting means. What a healthy fun loving relationship means. From your experiences and your personal values and goals. And youll finally meet that one person who points at it and tells you what it means and you shout Thats exactly what it means to me too!! But you have to be patient.  Learn. Grow. Repeat. And sometimes you learn more from the mistakes you make than the successes you have. I hope this all makes sense and I really hope this helps you. Good luck out there girl ,actuallesbians,ck5erdc,6,t5_2rch0
1795395,0,t3_2f1y5b,This is why I think a lot of queer folk gravitated to anime in their youth. Stay with me. For many of us seeing gay characters in yaoi and yuri helped us to identify with something and feel more normal and less perverted. Thats how it worked for me. As I got older I was able to seek out more and more gay media such as TV shows movies books even youtube channels. This sort of exposure to a gay friendly version of all the forces that usually tell you that gayness is a perversion I find to be super healthy for my self esteem. I suggest you read lesbian fiction written by lesbians preferably or go watch some of the youtube channels that were suggested in a thread a few days ago. The more often you see it the more normal it will become to you. You will like the characters and identify with them and as a result begin to like your self more. Additionally you have to actively tell your self that you are normal and not perverted. Like you must make a conscious effort to identify the self harming thoughts you have and stop them. To do this I created a little imaginary persona who would slash through my bad thoughts with a dramatic bladed weapon of some sort. In order to remember to use her I dawned an accessory that I physically wore every day to remind me shes here to protect my psyhci. I chose a thick leather bracelet as my accessory but chose anything you like. Just be sure that what ever it is its new. You must buy or make something whos entire meaning is the physical representation of your choice to oppose your self loathing thoughts. I hope this helps. ,actuallesbians,ck5giu9,2,t5_2rch0

1846043,0,t1_ckbjmhh,gtMaybe those women just left you because they found somebody they liked better. And that somebody happened to be a man.No they didnt. All three of them explicitly said that they either amissed men  or b found it too difficult to be in a same sex relationship. They said so. This is the blind spot that you guys dont want to see past. Like it or not plenty of bi women do leave because theyd rather take the easier more socially acceptable privileged road. That happens. It happened to me. The women were very honest about why they were leaving. Sorry but after three women doing that I feel that I have every right to be wary of getting serious with bi women. You dont want to admit that this happens and I understand why but it does happen. It happened to me and it has happened to other lesbians.My aim isnt to make you feel guilty about your sexuality. It is to make you understand why there is this divide between lesbians and bisexual women. As for saying you are less gay? Well you arent gay at all. Youre bi. I dont see the relevance in that statement. They are two totally different sexualities. My statement isnt about making you feel guilty for being with a man. It is about the women who use lesbians for sex and fun and a window into the queer world when it is convenient but never have any intention of being a real crusading member of this oppressed community and have no intention of ever being in a real bona fide out and proud same sex relationship. If that is not you then I am not talking about you.I am not disappointed in bi women who wind up with men. Its not my business who anyone dates or sleeps with unless they are sleeping with me. And I never said that all bisexual women are part time queers. Just the ones who frequent lesbian or LGBT areas when it suits them then acts like they arent even a part of this community the ones who use lesbians for sex but only have relationships with men. Those are the ones I am talking about. Again if that isnt you then I am not talking about you.And for the record? I had absolutely no issue with bi women until those experiences. I viewed the first woman as a fluke and wrote her off as a flaky chic who didnt know what she wants and that I was better off without her. Second one raised a bit of a yellow light but I tried to keep an open mind. Third one? HUGE RED FLAG. It was when I realized that I was being a fool and that Id better make damn sure next time that if the girl is bi that she isnt just using me for fun sex or whatever else between men.,actuallesbians,ckbn6wh,-1,t5_2rch0

1902420,0,t3_2geowu,I also get really anxious if something in my relationship doesnt feel right. Im someone who easily gets overwhelmed if I move too fast in the relationship that Im not ready for and I get panic attacks and my body starts to make me cry without my control. Ive learned this is my body telling me that what Im in isnt right for me or what I want. Im too much of a people pleaser to realize it myself so Ive just learned to listen to my body although Im getting better at recognizing what I want. Like I dated someone who was being too focused on every little thing I did and said and theyd hold it against me ifwhen I changed my mind and never let me forget it. I didnt realize that that was all going on until I ended it and looked back and thought to myself whoh. What kind of person needs that much control in the relationship? It definitely was not for me. Wed try to be intimate but with her personality I didnt feel safe or secure enough to go through with it and I felt overwhelmed and freaked shit. And thats just something I learned about myself. I felt like I was in love with her and getting over her was really rough but I am so thankful now that she didnt want to be friends because...now I wouldnt want to be friends with her. She treated me like shit. After I got over that other girl I started talking to this other girl at the end of the summer. She lived an hour away and went to a completely different university but she was cute so I said to myself well fuck it summers almost over anyway and I lost this other girl so what more do I have to lose. I was in a mind set of no expectations and I went to see her drag show and we talked after she preformed and instantly hit it off. She asked to hang out again and soon we got super close. I dont feel under a microscope with her I dont have to worry about what Im saying because shes got a great sense of humor and understands mine I dont have to worry about what I do and even if I do something embarrassing we both laugh about it because neither of us have any flirting skills shes not clingy quite the opposite as she wants me to pursue what I want and encourages me to do my own thing I dont have to worry about being pressured into going too far in bed or because were both at the same level of experience and were both super respectful of each other. Im someone who is VERY EASILY overwhelmed by moving too fast or if one little thing is wrong in the relationship it gives me a panic attack and it makes me cry and freak shit. This is the most amazing relationship Ive ever come across since coming out. Trust me OP its worth it to wait for someone special. Someone who is patient and understanding and someone you cant wait to be with. You shouldnt feel nervous at all or stressed. With this girl Ive found we can be a hideaway from stressful school days and workouts and work for each other. Its an amazing and loving relationship. That is something you deserve to have.My point is. If she still pushes for you two to have a facebook official title after knowing how you feel about it she cares more about her status of being not single than being in a relationship with you. Youll know youre in a great relationship when it feels easy. When joking around is easy when you understand when the other person needs you to be more understanding careful etc and vise versa and respecting boundaries. And you both naturally want to. It may be because shes younger inexperienced newly out or whatever but she doesnt care or respect your wishes. Trust commitment issues aside if what you need is a relationship that unfolds slowly then you need it slower. If you arent ready to come out you arent ready. End of story. Youll get there at your own pace and she needs to understand that. If she cant you both are just incompatible. . If youre in a panic its your body telling you something is wrong. Unless you two talk it out and she starts to be more accommodating of what you need it sounds like a relationship not worth sticking it out for. ,actuallesbians,ckifi2d,3,t5_2rch0

2012526,0,t3_2hstx2,Okay Im gonna assume that when he told you about his feelings he was generally polite and stuff or you wouldnt need to ask us about this in the first place. Nobody can tell you whether or not to be friends with this guy. Thats your call based on how nice he is as a friend and how awkward you feel. I would say however that just confessing his feelings  whilst inappropriate and dumb  doesnt inherently mean you should write him off as a terrible person. Skim some of this subreddit. Look at the amount of girls wondering if they should tell their straightcommitted friend their feelings. Its a pretty regular question here and among people in general. The fact is that yes it is stupid to do for the exact reasons youve outlined in your post it puts the other person in an awkward position and doesnt resolve anything. But these girls and this guy do it for reasons they think are good generally that itll bring them closure or something. Side note if anyone reading this has a crush on a straight or taken person read the OP and understand why fessing up to your friend is a terrible idea. It might give you closure but itll make them feel shitty and awkwardIf you decide to be friends with him thats fine but you need to have an honest talk where you set hard boundaries. Essentially read codesloths bullet points to him. Explain that youre willing to pretend this never happened but he must get over the crush must not flirt or anything like that you will categorically never return the crush. If he fails to respect those boundaries then its definitely time to ditch him.,actuallesbians,ckvpfq3,21,t5_2rch0

2050878,0,t1_cl0hp4v,Thanks! I wouldnt say Im safe Id say I try to be realistic. Chances of catching anything as a lesbian? Slim yeah but not impossible. Still Im not a fan of dental dams so that increases my risk  best to therefore avoid situations which are riskier for ff sex. That means no oral sex if Im feeling paranoid no touching with any open wounds no touching anything which makes me feel like Im more at risk. It also means regular STI testing because I do not want to have to call up old partners and tell them that my assumption that lesbian sex is safe was wrong. If I catch something I want to be able to pinpoint exactly where I got it as much as I can.STIs are  generally  not the end of the world. HIV is awful yes but were at a very very low risk of that. Herpes is for life yes and the thought of getting it is scary but its still manageable its the social stigma which makes it tough. Chlamydia and all that? Regular STI testing and youll sort it out early with the appropriate antibiotics. Its society which makes these things sound damn terrifying. You can get tonsilitus from kissing just like you can get STIs from sex but nobody treats that like a horrible shameful thing. If you try to treat STIs like any other illness most of them seem a lot less scary and a lot more manageable.,actuallesbians,cl0ifwb,1,t5_2rch0

But then because of that it seems a little off to me to then post in this particular place with a comic that is about women liking men or their butts P. Having said that though I get that this is just one silly cartoon which I liked when I saw it elsewhere and that the actually relevant subreddits   simply arent as active e.g. rbiwomen I get too that the bipan women who call ractuallesbians their subreddithome probably dont really want to have to compartmentalise their conversations into different subreddits.

2089068,0,t3_2itbd9,I was in a similar situation when my partner and I moved into together. I didnt have a car had a lesser paying job and I had student loan debt. I felt horrible for all of those reasons. But we loved each other and wanted to make it work. We rented for many years and she covered the majority of the rent while I paid off my student loans. I still felt guilty but we were in it for the longterm and she never made me feel bad about it. It sounds like your girlfriend wont either.  I tend to overcompensate so I just took on more cleaning and cooking to make myself feel better about not contributing as much financially. She didnt expect that from me but it made me feel better. I still make half of what my partner makes but never do I feel like the lesser half. We each contribute to our family in different ways. Definitely get the living wills done. It is the most important piece if youre going to be on the title and are worried about her family. If you want to make the relationship work stop feeling bad about not being your girlfriends financial equal. Clearly she loves you.

2208722,0,t3_2ke19a,I am a feminist and I swear this is probably one of the few threads Ive seen where feminism is embraced and not bashed ignorantly and mercilessly.  Its refreshing really.  I can see why people might be offput by feminism in general. Because feminism is an umbrella term that applies to countless social efforts it seems that a majority of people only really pick up on the radical movements unfortunately.  Feminism essentially is a movement for gender equality. And its so disheartening that people reject feminism as if to say that the genders are unequal. Boys cant wear pink bruh. shudders  Yet I am optimistic because I believe anyone who rejects feminism hasnt been educated about it. To realize how prevalent misogyny is in daily life is sad yet its an opportunity for people to understand why social progress in our society is practically nonexistent. To gain education on feminism is the first step to bettering this damn world.  I used to dismiss feminism and then I went to university and I was relieved from my own ignorance. Sheesh education is so important.  Personally I take great interest in promoting feminism as a combatant to social acceptance of rape and domestic violence. Women are victimblamed much more often than the perpetrator is blamed. A thief broke into your house and stole all of your stuff? Well maybe you shouldnt have enticed the public with such a nice front door. Da fuck..And Male survivors are pariahs and not taken seriously for the heinousness done unto them. Its all so fucked up all so real and yet its one of the most taboo topics to bring up in conversation.,actuallesbians,clkkzdm,9,t5_2rch0

It is not acceptable that your therapist is not the one you would express this to. You should get a new one.

2323948,0,t1_clxzbxf,Honestly write a budget. See whats actually viable and whats not. Also remember that if you want that kitten then pets are expensive. It seems like you just need some food and maybe a couple of toys but vet bills will rack up so fast you wont know what hit you and you guys will need plenty of savings just in case something awful happens and the kitty needs emergency treatment. Or if it damages the rented place or furniture and your landlord suddenly demands a load of money to fix it  if you can have a pet at all in a rented place. A lot of landlords who let to young people will explicitly forbid any pets in my experience.The way I see it if you dont move in together it might take you longer to save money but youll both be financially secure and not doubt it being too early.If you move in together now you guys could probably save a lot more money yeah but would you actually save it or would it be frittered away? Im a nightmare fritterer so I wont judge! Likewise work out that budget and see whether you could afford finding a new place and breaking the lease if you need to. If you think you could absorb that cost  go for it!Dont be a pessimist but nobody ever regretted making sure their choices were informed before rushing into things. Best case scenario you guys stay together and now you have a load of savings for building your life.

Go spend time with those people and those authors immerse yourself in those worlds get to know those characters. Let yourself love those people they will not betray you or hurt you.Learn a language and soak up its culture. If you decide to learn french watch french movies go to Museums with French art and artefacts join the Alliance Francaise in your area. Whichever language you choose get involved.Take up a new pursuit and get involved in the community. While you cant do a physical activity get into artistic pursuits. Someone else suggested knitting. I like ceramics. Learning the basics of painting is easy with youtube. Gardening is also great. Even if you dont have a big garden you can buy pots and seeds and thats not a huge expense and plants are pretty forgiving. Maybe your area has an allotment or a community garden.

Girls at gay bars will ask me if Im a lesbian and Ill just stare at them and sip my drink. If I dont have a drink I just smirk. No point in answering a question you dont know the answer to.

2389286,0,t1_cm6xmf2,How does me indicating my strong disagreement by saying bullshit and then explaining why prohibit discussion?Feminism doesnt blame every male for the patriarchy. Which is the kind of thing I was talking about. That is a disingenuous straw argument andor oversimplification. The fact that some small percentage of people claiming to be feminists doesnt understand what theyre talking about doesnt really have any bearing on the validity of feminism as a whole. It certainly doesnt help that so many people would rather talk about how bad this mythical radical feminism is than vocally support womens issues and gender equality. But it sure helps people who wants the status quo to continue and who doesnt want more agency for women since this actively helping them divert the debate. Instead of addressing actual issues we now instead constantly have to go on the defensive against hearsay nonsense about the comparatively trivial radical problem.And another big problem is that people arent willing to see that they might be more or less unwilling contributors to the problem. Deep societal problems like sexism and misogyny doesnt go away just because you intellectually know that it exists and disagrees with it. Its too pervasive for that. With things like this we might actually have to make real changes and open some uncomfortable doors regarding how we behave and view the world. I think that creates a lot of kneejerk contrary reactions in people. Hell several time Ive caught myself reacting in sexist ways to women in my daily life. Its very insidious and unsettling but Ive forced myself to dig deeper and look at my behaviour.,actuallesbians,cm70u34,7,t5_2rch0

2439063,0,t3_2nfanl,I stayed closeted for  years  just in case your couple of years starts to seem a bit long.    Mostly I just kept my private life very private.  I was in a relationship but the only people who knew about it were my SOs friends not my friends.  I never talked about my private life with anyone.  To my parents I just lied.  My SO was a good friend when I was out with my SO I was studying alone in the library there were no lesbian books or materials at my house.  To my parents I was an asexual nerd who chose to focus on my studies and who was just too awkward and immature to be interested in boys.  In reality I was in a longterm monogamous relationship with my SO and really good at hiding it.The important thing is dont let the hate and homophobia get to you  and the way to do that is just to NEVER talk about gay stuff with your parents.  If you do youll just get hate and homophobia and why do you need that? And just for the record I came out to my parents at age  when I finally met the girl who was worth that risk.  They will be attending our wedding next year.  They said theyd even pay for our honeymoon.  It does get better.,actuallesbians,cmd69jl,5,t5_2rch0

2564239,0,t1_cmt9s1b,Youre basically saying since shes in a lesbian relationship her effective behavior how she selfidentifies excluded is practically indistinguishable from that of a lesbian and that her orientation becomes a nonissue. Isnt this exactly what bi people say shouldnt happen? How a bi person being with a person of the same sex isnt suddenly gay and shouldnt be treated as such bi erasure? I would like to be in a relationship where both partners are free and glad to express sexual desire and attractions they also experience with other people which will certainly happen now whether or not they can act on it is a different subject of open relationships I wont be getting into and I would simply not be able to entertain a whole part of her sexual identity. This to me seems like a very large gaping pool of potential problems for both of us one being her repressing a part of herself because she feels I wouldnt understand which I probably wouldnt. From what Ive been reading in bi oriented spaces a lot of people say their attractions fluctuate over time even when they are in mono relationships. Im not gonna lie the thought of a bi girl expressing trouble because shes been having strong sexual feelings for men lately would feel very disheartening because there would be absolutely nothing I could do about it. It wouldnt be about something I could improve on or something that we could reach a middle ground on no one would be in the wrong it would just universally suck. ,actuallesbians,cmta8mf,2,t5_2rch0

So we went back to my place after making out for a bit  I took her pants off and she said she was on her period and didnt want to have anything done to her... Which was awkward but fine.  Then she asked where there was a key so she could get out in case I fell asleep. I told her I wasnt going to just fall asleep and would let her out whenever she wanted but she insisted so I showed her.

A positive attitude is the best place to start.Being  gets me nowhere lt is what you should title this thread. My big sister was straight and crushed on guys that rejected her or fucked her for fun she wasis gorgeous but men have this shes too pretty for me insecurity. As dark and isolated as your life seems the same is true for a third of your classmates all for different reasons.As you get older youre gaydar will improve and your ability to navigate the available girls from the nevergonnahappen will improve. Be damn sure you go to college! A lot of straight girls experiment there and theres a bigger lesbian community. You have a lot to look forward to.Best of luck!

2841097,0,t3_2smrdk,They work together work out together carpool to work togetheramp they even hang out on top of that.That list seems pretty positive to me. Those are all great things to do with a positive influence. This is a similar description of my best guy friend and I. Only were in our early s. So Ill tell you about why himand I are so close and maybe that will help you gain an understanding. My best friend is a really positive guy he sees the good in everyone. He also sees the good in me. His actions and who he is in life and work serves as a model of how I want to be perceived. Good friends make you feel like it is okay to be who you are no matter what and great friends influence you to want to change on your own.They dont point out the bad and say do better. They point out the good they listen they provide their perception to all you talk about.My best friend does this for me and vice versa. We talk about our troubles we talk about how to handle it he makes me want to do better in those aspects. He knows me through and through the same as I know him. We smoke weed and we talk. Not about girlfriends but about life goals. We tell each other of our dreams and aspirations. We challenge each other to go for it. To others he too could be labeled as very irresponsible but they dont know him. They dont know how hard he works what hes doing how smart he is. People like to villianize the people they dont know or dont care to know. It is dehumanizing. We are multifaceted. It is normal for some girls to have friends regardless of gender and being a lesbian takes a lot of the pressure off. A lesbro provides all the awesome friendship that guys do plus the emotional aspect that guys dont get to express very often. Its a winning friendship.She seems like she hasnt changed rather the way you treat her is changing. My best friend brings out my inner self too. The more playful positive side. And I feel like I have to tame it down in front of my girl too. So I dont freak her out. It isnt healthy for her to tame it down. She needs to be who she is and you need to accept her for it and encourage her to follow her path. It seems as if youre relying heavily on societal expectations of what you should do when settling down rather than living your life. Families fall into place. Yes there has to be responsibility but she shouldnt have to sacrifice her friendship.You recognize you are jealous. You recognize insecurities. It seems you are only focusing on the negative and these are in your head poisoning your interaction with others. if you want love and commitment you have to be love and commitment. And by being those things she will want those things. But you are being jealous and paranoid so all she feels is jealousy and paranoia. ,actuallesbians,cnr13bf,2,t5_2rch0
2849314,0,t3_2sotja,Its a bit odd for me in this regard. Im unsure about children. When I was younger  I did absolutely want children but I got into a relationship with someone that  did NOT want kids. I got used to that idea and decided that I can do without kids. We got dogs instead. And then about  years ago my baby brother came into the picture and I learned a ton about raising a child. This enlightened me a lot about what I want in my life. So now I am unsure about kids and my partner has started to warm up to the idea of kids. Its like I do want children but then I get afraid. Im terrified of failing at being a parent and thats my biggest issue. I see how much patience my mother has and how my lil bro can stress me out so easily. But then again Im only  and she is . So we shall see what the future entails in regards to having my own babies. Maybe in my s Ill be ready if the person that Im with is also ready.

I can get someone having a footinmouth moment and implying the former when they mean the latter. Also does she know shes hit an insecurity of yours here?If it is the former you could try adding more fruit and fruit juice to your diet and see if that helps. Or try tasting yourself to work out if you think its normal or what. I know how bad it sucks to be insecure but if you know that you taste normal it means that you shouldnt stress yourself out trying to improve what cant be improved. If its the latter Id probably sit down and explain that although you appreciate she was just being honest it made you feel like going down on you is something she grits her teeth through rather than enjoys it. Granted not everyone loves the taste I cant say I do but I dont hate it either just indifferent but unless theres something off with the taste something which could be improved with diet or whatever I wouldnt comment on it personally.

2933761,0,t3_2tr1v0,I can say that I wasnt really raised in a family that condemned being gay becuase my mom was best friends with a gay guy although when it came to her children that was not accepted. my mom found out I was dating my girlfriend at the time in high school and freaked out on me. Her mom and my mom forbidded us to see each other but that didnt stop us. Although when I was ready to come out to everyone and stop hiding it was a lot harder to come out to my mom because of that memory but she is more accepting of it now. Like your parents though she hopes one day ill marry a guy and give her grand kids. I keep telling her that wont happen but she still hopefull yet is also accepting of my girlfriends when I bring them home.I know family is very important to people and the acceptance from their parents. I would try having a talk with your parents again and letting them know that youre happy and that you want them to be happy for you. I know its hard to break away from your upbringing but you shouldnt let that make you feel guilting for be happy with the person you are with. You have to realize this is your life and nobody elses you make the decisions on what makes you happy and most comfortable. I hope im making sense... if you have any questions you are more than welcome to PM ,actuallesbians,co1kwyw,1,t5_2rch0

This is a really hard situation and I am having a hard time deciding what to advise because I myself am so passive that I would probably let it go but ideally what I would do was add her on whatever social media you are currently stalking her on and then try to message her when you feel comfortable and maybe see about asking if she wanted to hang out some time then go from there.

2940764,0,t3_2tu6uy,You really had to do that she was stringing you along. I see a lot of posts around these parts about situations which are similar to yours except the situation drags on. We always give advice to cut it loose because thats a can of drama that isnt even about you but about the bigger picture for the other person. She probably cares about you at least as a friend not to say more obvs but she was being selfish here. She told you she was straight and then acted in a totally opposite direction without ever talking to you about what it all might mean. She thought she could have you on stand by while she figures her shit out. Well no and good for you for standing up against that. ,actuallesbians,co2dltr,23,t5_2rch0

2961604,0,t3_2tybhj,I think that part of the reason you think you cant come out is because you have emphatically denied it so many times. This sort of happened to me. I said Not gay but Im an ally so I had the excuse to be around all the pretty ladies. The best thing I did when I was fully aware of myself was to be honest with the people around me. When they said But you always said you were straight! or But you dated that guy or you made fun of that lesbian at Starbucks I would say I was scared of what you would think so I kept it a secret. This made me extremely vulnerable but it also left the ball in their court to show me that that was not the case. I always got positive responses because no one wanted to seem like a jerk or they genuinely were supportive.Good luck. Try not to care about what other people think. In the end it is only you living your life not them.,actuallesbians,co4qz0h,2,t5_2rch0

Whether this one is the right one I dont know. Usually when people dont reply it means theyre not interested. She seemed unsure to start with mainly because of the age difference. The date didnt help your cause as you came of a little young so it might have scared her off. I always think its worth trying if youre into someone until you get a firm no. Maybe you can call her? Invite her to do something that doesnt involve drinking perhaps? If she doesnt reply or says no then youve got your answer and you can move on.,actuallesbians,cohf6a7,8,t5_2rch0

It was a combination of me being in step programs and her developing Parkinsons Disease and both of us realizing life was short.The thing is a relationship takes  people  there is only so much you can do on your side.

Also i got my fwb who has a guy as well her subpet whom i know longer then we know our respective guys we very much love each other but know a real relationship would be doomed we tried for a whileIts always because of some shitty bi girls the ones that can very well live without the d get flak anyways as if we are all cheating whores note the relationships i do have are more because im polygamous in nature and can love many indifferently this had been for a long while exclusively woman not because i didnt like men but because im picky,actuallesbians,cotc4t1,4,t5_2rch0

This can be very empowering e.g a label for an illness can reaffirm that youre not imagining your symptoms a label for your sexuality lets you know youre not the only one etc.  Theyre shithouse for saying anything meaningful about an individual specifically e.g knowing that I sleep with women because I identify as a lesbian doesnt give you any insight into my character at all.IMHO its the second aspect of labels that generates the antipathy for a lot of people label  stereotype.,actuallesbians,coucewc,1,t5_2rch0

Its not about being bipanphobic its that most women are looking for someone they can commit to and have a future with and you already have that person. In their eyes youre taken. Even people who are attracted to you arent usually going to be attracted to the idea of having this other person in the picture who you are always going to be more committed to than them.

Sometimes I feel I guess dirty or like somethings wrong with me because I am who I am. I wish I could release every ounce of anxiety and stress I have and enjoy life more. Watching videos on Youtube and things like that have helped me to accept myself. I make sure I use discrete usernames on social networking sites so no one knows its actually me whos running the accounts.  When I come out later on hopefully right after graduation Ill be able to ignore those who reject me and spend time with those who accept me.    Until then Ill keep talking to those who are loving. Tumblr has been really great so far for both the atheist and Lesbian community. Sometimes I wonder which reaction would be worse from my parents. ,actuallesbians,cpvp1qk,1,t5_2rch0

3542759,0,t3_30v0q2,Bi girl checking in. You might be a part of my club! In fact some studies estimate that about  of the LGBTQ community is bi or pansexual so youre not really alone in feeling a bit confused.So heres the dealio from someone whos been where you are in some respects I always knew I liked the idea of women but because of familial pressures religious pressures and cultural pressures yay growing up in uberRepublican land I always kinda tucked it away as something I would never act on until I met the right girl. Well call her Kat. Kat and I formed a really intense relationship that was just... amazing. It never felt wrong to me. I was told it should. And when I was younger and I pictured being with a woman in theory my brain said its wrong its wrong its wrong. As it was happening it felt really right. I think you might be feeling that surprisedcomfort too.So do you come out is the question? With Kat I didnt. I kept her as my friend. Brought her home met the folks but as my friend. I was  at the time and figured Id still find a nice man to settle down with later if this didnt work. I did date men after and some women. I was out to all my friends and out to all my coworkers just not my parents. They were the only people who didnt know and I didnt come out to them until I ended a three year relationship with a man and said If Im back on the market I want to be honest with my parents about what market that is. So I came out preemptively. It took me  years. I cant make a decision for you and no one can. But I can tell you being out is the most liberating feeling in the world. I actually wanted to spin around in a field like Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music. I wanted to dance and jump up and down and scream I LIKE BOTH!!! BOTH!!!! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTH! My parents took it... okay. My dad better than my mom. My mom refuses to talk about it and gets silent if I ever mention a girl even if shes just a friend. But when were not talking about women everything is as it was before. My dad cracks inappropriate jokes. But he doesnt ignore it. Your parents wont react like mine. Theyre going to react in some new unique way. But for me it was so totally worth it to be out in my own time. TLDR You need to feel comfortable with you. If coming out helps and  times out of  it does do it. If it hinders dont. But you do you. ,actuallesbians,cpw3ich,7,t5_2rch0

3573298,0,t3_319exs,Hi! Im a writer thats attempting to write a book about lesbians that takes place in the s. As a result Ive done a good bit of research on lesbian history. For some interestinglighter reading Autostraddle has a series of articles about lesbians in history. Heres a link to them.This website has some pretty interesting stuff about queer women in history too.Ive enjoyed reading both Boots of Leather Slippers of Gold by Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy and Madeline Davis and Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers by Lillian Faderman. Theyre both very informative and I like them because they both have pictures and commentary from lesbians that actually lived during the periods they talk about. Both of these books can be fairly expensive if youre trying to buy them so I suggest checking out digital copies of them for free on openlibrary.org.I dont know if youre interested in historical fiction but if you are you HAVE to read Stone Butch Blues by Leslie Feinberg. Its not the most elegantly written book but damn will it tear you apart. It also gives you a great perspective on queer womens culture in the s and s. As for films I dont have any nonfiction but some great historical fiction movies with lesbians in them are If These Walls Could Talk  this one is all about lesbians and Common Ground a third of this one is about lesbians. But its a pretty enjoyable third. The BBC also did a miniseries called Tipping the Velvet which is based on a book by Sarah Waters. You can find all of these for free on Youtube. Theres also Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe which is both a book and a movie. I find the movie to be disappointing because the lesbian relationship from the book is just turned into a special friendship but its still pretty good if you ignore that part. I mostly know about the s but I know a bit about the s as well. Here are some things you might want to research s working class butch femme bar culture lesbian pulp fiction Cherry Grove the Daughters of Bilitis and the class and racial divides amongst lesbians during this times Second wave feminisms affect on lesbianism the Lavender Menace Rita May Brown and her book Rubyfruit Jungle and the Stonewall riots Hope I could help! ,actuallesbians,cpzl0x9,8,t5_2rch0

Its really way more casual peer run discussion and social outings restaurants gay bar potlucks parks random activities than anything. After Id been going for about a year just to meet people and be more social a new lady came to a meeting. She was really pretty and I tried not to look at her. It mostly worked. We exchanged numbers at the end of group since she was new to the area eventually started texting hung out a couple of times on our own I thought she liked me and had might have been flirting a bit so I interjected a text convo withOh I had pea soup for lunch its really good I put cheese on it. What did you have? Btw do you like me romantically?She called me and said she was going to ask me out at the next group but shed just do it over the phone. I of course accepted. We really hit the ground running and I love her a ton. Weve only been going out a relatively short while but I see good things for us and no reason to rush anything. P.S.From my perspective I met a nice new lady after doing something for a year for fun and not getting much headway with online dating which I was pretty ambivalent about in the first place. From her perspective she meets a lady who she was attracted to from the moment our eyeballs touched after the first meeting of a group she attends after moving across country to start a life change.

A lot of people like to use it in a reclaiming sense but a lot of people use it when they first come out as a defense mechanism to their own internalized homophobia.  You really never know how someone might feel about that word so while you are totally within your rights to use it be careful as it can be highly triggering to a lot of folks.  Be you!  Dress however feels good to you and fits the dressiness or casual vibe of the place youre visiting. Introduce yourself to women and let people know youre visiting and would love to get to know people and the place.  Ask for suggestions for attractions you shouldnt miss.  Make your goal to have fun stay safe and meet new people and you likely will.

The modern laymans meaning of top and bottom with regard to sex is related to positioning in some contexts. Hence why I said it can be construed as whos on top of whom.You asked since when has topbottom been about directions.

I dont wear many dresses skirts floral or whatever things but all the clothes I wear are definitely aimed and marketed at women and I always wear makeup. My hair is pretty medium length and shaggy not long or short. Im very skinny but my figure is feminine enough that I can be boyish or very feminine depending on what I wear.Over the course of my short dating life Ive been with plenty of different girls. Some so feminine that they were rarely out of a dress with very long hair and lots of girly makeup others more athletic with short hair and a more tomboyish dress sense. And you know what? People decide Im the man if Im with a feminine woman and the woman if Im with a more tomboyish one.

Yeah it sounds like the mature thing to do and sounds like openness and honesty and all sorts of good things  but if you tell her she will always wonder just a little about why you told her.  Did you mean that she was inadequate?  Did you mean that your relationship wasnt good enough for you?  Are you thinking of leaving her?  That sort of thing.Now if you do want to end your relationship then yes you need to talk to your girlfriend break up in a mature way and move on  but it sounds like you dont want to do that so dont tell her.  Its OK to not tell your partner everything thats on your mind.  Theres really nothing that she can do with that information and theres no way this information will do anything other than hurt.  People develop crushes its normal.  Youll lust after Callie for a while and then youll get over it.  If it all stays inside your head no harm done.  ,actuallesbians,cqe2eue,1,t5_2rch0

3767376,0,t3_33jhaa,It sounds like she has some serious issues around relationships and commitment which she needs to talk out with a professional preferable or work them out in her own way however that is.  While having other people motivate you might work for you some people are entirely selfmotivated and having someone constantly telling them that things can be better etc has no impact on how they feel about the issue at hand and can in fact be annoying.Id say that before pressing on the issue of your relationship you need to help your girlfriend deal with whatever her issues with relationships commitment and selfesteem that she has.  How?  Ask her. Dont make it about your relationship make it about her.   Scarily she might ask for timespace away from you and the relationship.  Give it to her.  Its entirely possible to be in love with someone and not feel like youre in a place to be in a relationship with them for whatever reasons.   You cant force it.

3810748,0,t1_cqqmsy0,Well in my experiences trans people seem to be ready to get offended at the drop of a hat. Or carry way too much baggage for way too long and let it affect them and their relationships way too much. Some people are ignorant to trans issues etc. and actually arent trying to offend. Educate dont argue. But not many trans people do that.   I dont get trans men that request male pronouns prior to putting in any effort in assuming their male identiy likewise for trans women.  I dont get how upset people get over innocent misgendering. Sometimes its actually NOT easy to gender someone.   I dont understand someone thats proud to be trans. Be proud of what youve overcome not proud of your affliction. Ive never heard of someone being proud to have cancer it just makes no sense.  And I dont understand a trans person that didnt realise until they were older lets say late s or older. Being trans doesnt just happen one day.  I know not many in my shoes share my opinions and I realize it doesnt paint me in a good light but its how I feel. ,actuallesbians,cqqnma0,-3,t5_2rch0

I mean one huge thing she always said was that she wondered what the parents of trans people had done to fuck them up so much. It wasnt until I had a relationship with somebody who identifies as nonbinary that she realised its not strange at all. Sometimes its a knee jerk reaction people have because theyre seeing something theyre not used to. Your sister was probably just embarrassed about seeing  girls kiss and I have friends who feel they same even though they arent homophobic. Its just a little odd for them and so she said something without thinking. Remember people do change. Most homophobia is just ignorance.

Weve got very open lines of communication so we talk about things and work it out peacefully.  Thats what Id recommend to you both before and after moving in together.  Talk about things.  If her habit of leaving her socks on the dinner table drives you nuts dont just seethe in private  tell her whats bothering you and work out a solution.

4218550,0,t3_39699b,INFJTgtThe INFJ personality type is very rare making up less than one percent of the population but they nonetheless leave their mark on the world.I feel special.cgtAs Diplomats NF they have an inborn sense of idealism and morality but what sets them apart is the accompanying Judging J trait.I dont wanna be all judgy though.gtINFJs are not idle dreamers but people capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting positive impact.Are you sure though? Doesnt really sound like me.gtINFJs indeed share a very unique combination of traits though softspoken they have very strong opinions and will fight tirelessly for an idea they believe in. That sounds much more like me.gtTo INFJs the world is a place full of inequity  but it doesnt have to be. No other personality type is better suited to create a movement to right a wrong no matter how big or small. INFJs just need to remember that while theyre busy taking care of the world they need to take care of themselves too.Sounds about right yeah.gtFamous INFJs Martin Luther King Nelson Mandela Mother Teresa Nicole Kidman Jimmy Carter Mel Gibson Goethe and James Wilson from House M.D.Aw sweet. gtStrength include Creative Insightful Inspiring and Convincing Decisive Determined and Passionate and Altruistic.Aside from decisive yeah. gtWeaknesses include Sensitive Extremely Private Perfectionistic Always Need to Have a Cause and Can Burn Out Easily.Ouch but yeah. gtINFJs often have the advantage of desirability  they are warm friendly caring and insightful seeing past facades and the obvious to understand others thoughts and emotions.This sounds positive right? gtINFJs are enthusiastic in their relationships and there is a sense of wisdom behind their spontaneity allowing them to pleasantly surprise their partners again and again. INFJs arent afraid to show their love and they feel it unconditionally creating a depth to the relationship that can hardly be described in conventional terms. Relationships with INFJs are not for the uncommitted or the shallow.This is very very true. gtWhen it comes to intimacy INFJs look for a connection that goes beyond the physical embracing the emotional and even spiritual connection they have with their partner. People with the INFJ personality type are passionate partners and see intimacy as a way to express their love and to make their partners happy. INFJs cherish not just the act of being in a relationship but what it means to become one with another person in mind body and soul.Ah I feel all warm and fuzzy now woo! At first I was kind of worried about being rare. Although now it sounds a lot less negative. ,actuallesbians,cs13isq,1,t5_2rch0

If your pride event is anything like ours was there will be checks at the entrance to make sure that bottles are unopened and still have their factory seal so folks dont sneak alcohol in. Expect silliness. Lots of folks walking around with signs or body paint saying free hugs. At our booth we had a prize wheel and  of the prizes were hugs and highfives the rest were lifesavers pins tshirts and stickers. Lots of folks wanted a hug in addition to what they won. If you plan to go topless be familiar with your states laws on public nudity. Some states allow women to go topless in public some dont. Some states are OK with bodypaint instead of upper clothing other states want pastiessomething to hide nipples. Last year there were a lot of women with a bikini top that looked like she was topless presume that this link is NSFW. This year lots of tape covering the nips. For some reason there is a new fashionfad with furry tails. No one I chatted with knew why. If you can get one of those Homo Estas Chipotle tshirts in small I would like to buy it. One of the women who volunteered at our booth wanted one but I was unable to get one for her.

4368425,0,t3_3b1rnb,Me and you were in the exact same position. My parents are traditional Somali Muslims. I tried waiting till I moved out but unlike you I still dated secretly. Anyways just as Im heading off to uni is when I told my mum Im not Muslim and also gay. She took it really hard and didnt talk to me for like a year but has started asking my siblings if Im okay. Now we only talk if I initiate. She feels like she doesnt and never knew me. My dad on the other hand wont accept it. This guy disowned me for taking off the hijab. So when he found out I left Islam and was gay he was livid. He got some friends of his from his mosque and tried to find me. And he did twice. So Im kinda on the run from him even though we text sometimes. Weird? I know. Im just scared hes gonna beat me up or send me to Somalia or something.This isnt a reflection on Somali people. Generally Somalis are a live your life but keep it hush hush type. But my Dad is old and traditional straight from the motherland lol. Honestly though  psycho dad aside  Im so happy. I get to live my life openly. Date who I want and the saner members of my family just have to suck it because I take care of myself. So its not like they can manipulate me. I work two jobs though and am saving up just in case I cant get a job after uni. So I can still live by myself. I went off on one. But let me get to the point. Its a perfectly good strategy. Its not ideal but people like me and you were dealt a shitty hand. I would say that you should date privately from your parents. Why should you be celibate? What they dont know wont hurt them. Im here to talk if you want to swap stories. Just drop me a message and Im there. Edited just to add that I told all my siblings and was out to friends and in school. Just my parents were in the dark. So being semi out is my advice. It will help lift your spirits.,actuallesbians,csi21g6,12,t5_2rch0

I dont expect an apology they havent done anything wrong.Im honestly surprised at how overwhelming the responses have been that people are fine with being called girls as a couple or not.

4468308,0,t3_3c9b24,Be more up front. I find its easier to comunicate with people when you just tell them what you want. If they want the same thing they will say so. You also get more infromation from thier nonverbal responses in body language. Saying I would really like to kiss you right now or I would really like to sleep with you tonight or How would you feel about going on a romantic date things like that where everything is clearly laid out on the table will get a straight forward response even if she says nothing. She most likely will say Maybe or I dont know However she will either seem excited or scared. You then ask what would you like to do. She will likely respond with I just want to do what we are doing now.If she is from Ecuador then I can personally tell you the homophobia and lesbian phobia is supper fucking strong in that culture. Once my Ecuadorian friends mother took me aside to yell at me for hurting my mother by being a lesbian. We had never spoken before but by friend told her that I was gay. If she felt comfortable yelling at a random child for being gay I can only imagine what growing up in that culture would be like for a girl who thinks she might be a lesbian. Argentina is also married to gender roles they make southerners look liberal. My  year old friend Argentinian is not allowed to drive the family car because she is a woman and might get hurt. Her  year old brother who has crashed twice can take the car when ever he likes. She has a full time job to which she must take public transport. He does not. So it may very well be cultural. Talk straight with her. good luck. ,actuallesbians,cstwm5u,1,t5_2rch0
4468984,0,t3_3cbggv,Going through something similar right now. I identified as bi for a while hence the username but have recently seen my attraction to men fade away and had only dated one girl in those three years. A website that has helped me was autostraddle as well as youtube check LesbianAnswers GirlfriendsTV BriaandChrissy ElloSteph and the other channels that these promote or collab with. If you have a religious background then LesbianAnswers is the best. If you just need some interaction with the lgbt community and a place where you can be yourself until youre ready to come out tumblr can be good if you search for people who commonly post the type of content you need. Warning too much time on tumblr can make you forget that straight people are actually common. ,actuallesbians,cstzo2v,29,t5_2rch0
4473393,0,t3_3cd1fd,There is not much you can do to stop yourself from feeling shitty. And maybe it will be good in the long run to feel shitty abou it for a while right now. Maybe write yourself a letter to your future self reminding you why you made this choice.  I noticed that when my room mate broke up with her bf for similar reasons as you she looked at the past through rose tinted glasses. She talks about how she is missing the summer doing fun things with him. We have to remind her that in reality if she had dated him over the summer he would always be cancelling plans and she would spend her time home alone and sad. So dont let yourself forget how unhappy you are right now! Break up sadness will be temporary  and in the long run you are opening your heart to better future lovers. ,actuallesbians,csujkmz,3,t5_2rch0

4630796,0,t1_ctckxki,gt  she said verbatim no this isnt about any lack of understanding on my part but about the bullshit coming from the poly community and from you so Im cutting this line of discussion off.Verbatim means word for word and what you wrote is not what I actually wrote. This is what I actually wrotegtIn other news Im going to drop the poly discussion you and I are having.  You wrotegtgtI think all in all the disconnect here comes from one place that this is a community that likely you cant fully understand whether you kind of wound up sort of falling into that dynamic briefly or not.gtNo actually where Im coming from is not due to a lack of understanding on my part per your description here. But to get into that in this conversation with you would require me calling out not only poly bullshit possibly but also and more importantly some stuff that is specific to you  and doing that in a very harsh mode that I think would do little to assist our overall dialogue. So instead of doing that Ill drop this topic in the discussion.This was your replygtIm glad youre ending the poly conversation. I was about to do the same. We have as weve discussed before very different approaches to relationships and I feel like we were wading into unhelpful and potentially hurtful territory.gtOne thing its important for you to know though is that more and more each day I am feeling more connected a sort of kinship with the community. Ive realized that this is where I have belonged all along. I didnt embrace it before because I dont agree with many things that go on in the community. However the same is true of the LGBTQ community the black community etc....and I definitely identify with those communities. Anyway its important for me to tell you this because I doubt we can discuss our lives without delving into relationships and for me that will mean poly relationships.And my reply wasgtI support you having multiple polynonmo relationships in your life. In fact to be even more specific I especially support you in having multiple HEALTHY polynonmo relationships in your life. On the flip side What I am not going to do well with would be ideology and rhetoric. Meaning If our discussions about your relationships are about what they actually are in actual complex lived reality  your grounded experiences and actions  that should be fine. But if you veer into the ideologyrhetoric in ways that I dont see as being reflected in your actual grounded specific actions and experiences then well hit some tension. I hope that distinction makes sense.And you repliedgtAnd no problem re relationship emails. Were totally on the same page here. You sent me a couple more emails after that about your personal life without further discussion on any of that and then I stumbled across this reddit post this morning.To give a concrete example of what I meant bygtWhat I am not going to do well with would be ideology and rhetoric. Meaning If our discussions about your relationships are about what they actually are in actual complex lived reality  your grounded experiences and actions  that should be fine. But if you veer into the ideologyrhetoric in ways that I dont see as being reflected in your actual grounded specific actions and experiences then well hit some tension. Writing to me recently about poly people you said gtWe poly people are all about emotional health consideration communication etc.Yet your actions with the woman you were most recently involved with displayed really poor communication skills on your part as you yourself seemed to see. This is what I mean by ideology on one side not matching action on the other and that being a possible source of tension between you and me in discussing your relationships. In the email right before I decided to drop the poly discussion you wrote thisgtThey people like the woman you were involved with recently who are married and what you call situationally monogamous dont care about how other people feel how their antics affect the third people they bring in. They are selfish creatures who just want to do what they want to do how it affects other people be damned. Poly people are the opposite of that. We are all about emotional health consideration communication etc.And yet your own actions in how you communicated with her from the beginning and even as you described them to me yourself showed really poor communication practices on your part. As did your approach to ending this friendship with me. Privately over email assuring me it was okay while at the same time planning to cut things off with this distorted description here and hiding the whole thing behind the issue of poly as a stand alone because it appears simpler and doesnt require the kind of communication skills skills that you from our discussions I know you realize you dont have that can work with the reality of complicated human connection.The reality and at some level I am certain you know this somewhere inside yourself is that the tension between you and me has been rather more complicated than your story in the OP describes. For example in the exact same time span and email chains as our poly discussion I quoted above I had also started to set a relatively strong boundary around elements of my own life relationships and thinking that I was no longer willing to discuss with you. Choosing not to discuss aspects of my own life with you and clearly communicating that to you as a boundary and choice is not controlling you. It is setting a boundary related to my own life and what I will and will not share.Your poly ideology statement We poly people are all about emotional health consideration communication etc.versusYour actual communication practice in personal connections. That wordsversuspractice disconnect is precisely the kind of specifictoyou bullshit I didnt want to call out in a continued discussion with you about polyamory and I didnt feel okay didnt feel it would be honest on my part to continue the discussion about poly with you and stay silent about things like that. And that kind of wordaction disconnect was something that I trusted you would figure out for yourself over time.   ,actuallesbians,ctea6c3,2,t5_2rch0

The important thing to do is understand those emotions even if theyre sad so that you can properly move on when the time comes.  Introspection and meditation are beautiful things during times like this.  Sometimes we lose ourselves in long relationships... Focus on yourself.  Everyday.  Your goal should be to become the best you can be.  Build improve change.  Youll get better.  This time is good for you even if it doesnt seem so.  These things take time so be patient with yourself and learn to love yourself.  Three years doesnt just heal itself over night.

The amount of times Ive been made to feel like shit for my sexuality by folks in the LGBT community is unacceptable. And I totally feel the whole but look here bisexual girls are often simply awful to lesbians but I read this every single time this issue comes up and every single time it encourages me to further internalize personal biphobia to remind myself to find reasons why Im one of the good ones and consistently makes me scared for the possibility of my relationship going awry not just because it would be heartbreaking but because many folks in the queer community will be quick to point at my sexuality as the cause for the breakup especially if the next person I date happens to have a penis.Fucking hell I love my girl to pieces.

Were both old enough that shes found her balance with them so it doesnt emotionally drain her particularly to keep me a secret.   We dont have kids either so thats another complication out of the way.Honestly the only time it bothers me is at Christmas.  Weve never spent a Christmas day together.

I listed some of the things she said that were offensive and I made sure to tell her that I also knew she didnt mean to be hurtful and told her that was also why people werent saying anything either were canadian and thus very nonconfrontational as a rule.I also directed the conversation to make sure she had opportunity to tell me about anything in specific that was making her uncomfortable.  There was nothing in particular in our case but had there been I was prepared to discuss it at length to make sure it wasnt just a case of a lack of education on gay issues but also to ensure we werent being insensitive too.Really communication is the only that will properly solve this.  However it will be up to the lesbians of the group to power through the awkwardness that will come after because you guys are the majority.   Accept her again with open arms.There were some slips here and there that we tactfully ignored  or warmly accepted her apologies if she caught herself and overall it was really successful.

If someone doesnt want to date me because Im short because I wear glasses because I like to go to the gym because Im a bookworm because Im always online for work whatever that is just fine with me.

Which means that the options are . she was a straight girl having platonic fun with someone whose orientation is irrelevant . Shes a straight girl of the teasing kind they exist or . Youre on to a winner!Lets hope for option ! So if you think it would be awkward to ask her sister a more subtle way might be to contact Amy and say I had great fun the other night we should totally do it again sometime. A group of friends and I are going to gay bar would you be cool with joining us?

I dont want philosophical proof because its not proof of anything other than the ability of humanity to twist words and coincidences to their own ends which we are very very good at. You can philosophically prove almost anything. I want proof that actually means something. Real world physical reproducible and above all UNBIASED proof. Anything less is a dire insult to the very concept of proof. Thinking logically about an inherently illogical concept will not lead to a logical outcome. One more addition I personally am biased TOWARDS religion. I think most religions are very comforting concepts. Ive temporarily practiced several different religions.

5029530,0,t3_3jt12k,I joined mine while in the second year of uni and Im really sad to say that it didnt work out. I dont know I felt super awkward. I wasnt out yet I was only just starting to realise that I definitely wasnt straight and wanted a safe place with friendly people who could help me figure everything out. The club in comparison was very political and most of the members were aggressive activists. That isnt to say I wouldnt be perfectly willing to attend a rally NOW  but I was a baby dyke shy and insecure and I was spooked hardcore by their expectation that I put myself out there and join a cause I didnt know anything about.With that said I wont hesitate in saying its worth a try. You never know until you go there what the group dynamic is. I know that our competing university had a super chill hangout club and a separate political activism group which would have been really ideal for me. Others had VERY strict rules about behaviour that specified harassment and demands of activism were completely out of line. My advice is that you know exactly what your boundaries are but you dont let bad feelings or even other peoples bad experiences like mine get in your way. Chances are itll change your life completely and you will make lifelong friends. ,actuallesbians,cus90qr,3,t5_2rch0

5030208,0,t3_3ju4xw,Honestly I can relate to the quote. When I was about  I was already questioning my sexuality but I never met any lesbians before. I was and still am girly and I have assumed so are other lesbians. Then came the huge shock after I went to a lesbian party All I saw was tons of masculine looking women. it was creepy it didnt feel right for me. I told myself if those are lesbians Im not one of them. I found out later that this whole butch thing washt just a matter of personal taste and style preference it was mostly politically motivated which disturbed me even more. I was also criticized for being girly and supporting teh patriarchyTM. And to make matters worse people tried to manipulate me into giving the butches a chance. Im sorry but as much as I like women a masculine lady wont turn me on ever. I had enough norms and dogma from the straight world so I certainly didnt need more of that from the gay community. As a result I denied my orientation for another  years and was in a relationship with a guy in the meantime. Otherwise Id have come out much earlier. ,actuallesbians,cusbyhg,3,t5_2rch0

5049561,0,t3_3k0lir,Im probably gonna get some hate for this but whatever.I used to smoke up to two packs a day. Dont judge me I was young and impressionable and thought I was cool. Enjoyed it for a while. A few years later I just... stopped. My gf had stopped a while ago the same way. How you may ask?We. Just. Stopped.I think theres a huge conspiracy to make you think they are more addictive than they really are just to keep you hooked. Or something. But regardless the point is you can just stop. One day I woke up and noticed that I didnt enjoy my morning cigarette anymore. It was just drying my mouth and making me scratchy in my throat. I grabbed my ciggie pack and threw it away. I just had decided to stop.I still smoke very occasionally  times a month socially if I feel like one andthese ladies right here and I do share a hobby but otherwise it just stopped being relevant.I dont have tips because I believe every person has their own way of doing things and what worked for me might not work for you. But as general tips I can give you thisHonestly ask yourself. Do you really want to stop? Or are you stopping because you should? If its the former youll be alright without anyone to slap your wrist. If its the latter then you should know it probably wont work. I had to be disgusted with it in order to throw it away. My gf stopped because a lung infection mixed with pneumonia shut down one of her lungs and she almost died not being able to suck in any air so she was traumatized. My brother stopped because he realized it made him stink and hes a neatcleanliness freak. So you see find the reason you want to stop and just push it to the forefront of your mind at all times.

How little selfawareness do you have to have to upvote a cis person who thinks its okay to tell a trans person what is and isnt transphobia and then downvoting a trans person who tries to say hey cis people do not define what transphobia is. Also Im not condemning this Tinder person as some kind of disgusting pos or whatever but they are transphobic. I am trans and I still catch myself thinking and reacting to things in transphobic ways. Its a process of unlearning things that society has been drilling into us the minute we come into the world. Something I would have added onto my original comment  being a lesbian or a samegender loving person does not give you insight into being trans. Your opinion about trans issues does not have more weight because youre lesbianpanbi. If you are cis  you need to shut your mouth and stop talking over trans people ABOUT TRANSPHOBIA.edit okay im still going. how can someone be so ignorant to think that transphobia only presents itself as violence and calling people slurs?? like PEOPLE are transphobic. acting on your transphobia in violent and cruel ways is definitely transphobic but that is not the only way transphobia exists.,actuallesbians,cv1yyk7,2,t5_2rch0

5174831,0,t3_3lvbwb,Youre not alone at all! I was a late bloomer too. Sometimes it just takes you a while to understand who you are. We all go at our own pace. Be kind to yourself. As women were socialized heavily from birth to desire and seek validation from men and while that may be okay for the straight women and bisexuals it does a mind job on us lesbians. For me it was key to realize the difference between wanting male approval because thats where youre told you get your worth as a woman and actual attraction. I wanted their approval because Ive been conditioned to want it and in a mans world they hold all the cards so my life is better if I have them on my side in theory but I never actually truly desired them. I never truly loved them not in the romantic sense. It was more that I admired certain aspects of who they were as people and wanted to emulate them and as women were often led to conflate admiration and respect with sexual desire. So that was a big wakeup call for me when I realized I was forcing myself to be attracted to people I really had no desire for otherwise outside of a script of things I was supposed to do. The older I get the more I live the more I think life is really all about unlearning. If you can join lesbian groups on Meet up or network with your local gay scene in your new country. You need a friend who gets it and thats the best place to start. Good luck on your journey! ,actuallesbians,cv9r9tf,9,t5_2rch0

5207644,0,t3_3mbp2v,Your situation will turn off some women but not all. Whats important is to be upfront definitely use a dating profile where you can have the relevant things there from the start. One thing to keep in mind be clear about what youre looking for. Plenty of women arent interested in threesomes and its common enough on dating sites that people will likely assume its what youre after if you arent clear youre looking for side flings without your boyfriend youre far from the only one of those too.In my own experience having dated bisexual women and would happily do so again the only thing thats really different is that I dont share their experienceperspective of being interested in all genders and they dont share my experienceperspective of only being interested in one.Mostly its just an interesting kinda philosophical thing but there have been two bisexual women Ive met who didnt quite get the whole gay thing just didnt really accept that I had no interest in guys and they werent after threesomes. Still its an individual issue rather than a bisexual one not everyone is going to understand where everyone else is coming from. It shouldnt even be an issue mostly it was just annoying and they said some things I didnt appreciate but I figured its worth mentioning anyway.Anyway have fun having fun!

I have only dated femme women since thats the type that is drawn to me and I am super bad at pursuing crushesflirting.

Just because someone may lose an attracted when they find out someone is bi doesnt automatically make them biphobic.

5312001,0,t1_cvqnhod,gtI am trying to phrase this politely but If your crush is or identifies as male than you might have to consider that you arent a six on the Kinsey scale  . Does the gender of a person really matter more than what you feel for them?  ...I crushed on them before I was told they were possibly a guy. Im not interested in guys I just thought they were incredibly butch. The thought of them transitioning and getting facial hair and other dude stuff isnt attractive at all. gtWhy would it be rude to just approach that person ...I figured it would be inappropriate and somewhat insulting. Im really butch myself and Ive had people ask if I was trans and Ive been taken aback when they ask. Its probably stupid to be insulted by it considering its not that unreasonable to think if you saw me but I know how it feels to be confused for another gender and sometimes it kinda hurts. I just didnt want them to feel that way too. ,actuallesbians,cvqo4xg,6,t5_2rch0

God so much time being scared and sad and those feelings were buried so deep. Anyone who knew me would have said I was out and proud. I ran my high schools GSA I go to queer events in my city I never apologized for my sexuality... But part of me always wondered if I was really bi? I spent a lot of time hoping I was straight or hoping I was gay. I felt ashamed because I couldnt imagine settling down with either a man or a woman... It seemed like I would be betraying my gay side or my straight side to pick one so I figured I would be alone or unsatisfied forever. Then this year I met the best person ever and it all changed. My partner is genderqueer. Suddenly everything seems to make sense and I am SO happy that Im queer. It doesnt feel like a curse anymore.

I had my fair share of girlfriends and then when I turned  I got kinda sick of people telling me I couldnt be sure I was a lesbian if I never had sex with a guy this is offcource total bullshit. So after a few weeks just thinking about it I thought what do I got to lose? So there was this really sweet guy I knew for quite a while and I knew he had a crush on me. After a weird breakup with my ex girlfriend I went to his place and we talked. We were very honest with eachother and I told him I wanted to try having sex with him if he wanted it too and if it didnt change anything between us. I made it clear I was still a lesbian and I would probably still be one after we had sex. He told me he could handle it and wouldnt think more of it then an experiment. He was actually really flatterd that hed probably be the only guy Id ever sleep with.So we did it. He kept asking if I was alright and if it was hurting going really slow. I honestly was bored out of my mind. I didnt get any pleasure out of it and even though he tried to be sweet I was just sooo over it allready. Hahaha After we had sex we talked for a while about other things and my recent breakup. I was glad things werent awkward after this until he tried to force my ex girlfriend into having sex with him the very next day offcource. So.. To answer your questions I allready knew I was a lesbian. I didnt really had to have sex with a guy to find that out but I dont regret doing it. As far as how it effected my emotions.. After he tried to have sex with my ex I felt kinda.. Guilty? Maybe I made him think he could get any lesbian in the world now or something idk. But apart from that no emotional damages. I wasnt repulsed but to be honest I didnt even see nor touched his Dick we kept it under the covers haha but I was very bored for those  seconds.The thing is If you want to try having sex with a guy and you know a guy who wouldnt take advantage of you and knows the deal about you being a lesbian then theres nothing wrong with that. Go experiment! Just do it because you wnt to do it and not for any other reason.,actuallesbians,cwfurnb,4,t5_2rch0

5528794,0,t1_cwic4ct,Lol I hear you. I think its the commentary that can be offputting. Thats why I said decent but not great. But I know even in a quieter social setting this is what is happening with people. Its the eyes and the body language. If I thought there were some fun lesbian social gatherings around here I would enjoy I readily admit this is the stuff I do naturally because I like people. But where I live Id rather hang out with my cat and my roommate who likes to talk about hand cream and candle scents and who I secretly want to believe who could turn into a gay bff.Flirting in my head translates to how well one wants to connect to another person. The main theme and I tell people this all the time griping about dating the main takeaway from the video confidence eyes and body language. Not necessarily how one looks. It helps but your nonverbal language is signaling to others who you are long before they see what you look like. Ya dig?Sometimes I post these videos because I know it will appeal to less experienced babydykes who are more forgiving of the delivery of the message. I notice I get less responses when I share more scholarly big worded from the expert type videos. Hahaha go figure! ,actuallesbians,cwicots,2,t5_2rch0

Its like they think that theyre exempt from being held accountable for sexism because theyre gay. Just the other day I watched a buzzfeed video called Gay men ask lesbians questions we all want the answers to or something which . goes to show how much more visible and normalized gay men are and . had some really gross content like one man asking a woman why lesbians are so grumpy.

Even my friends whom Im out to will question which of us is the guy in the relationship.  And somehow because Im taller they tend to think of me as the protector despite the fact that Im really feminine.  Its also incredibly difficult to spot the gay girls with long hair.  Some of my femme friends have adopted a more androgynous or butch style in order to be seen by other girls.  Its just easier to be a butch apparently.

Cant stand people who have to insert their pet peeve everywhere it comes up its like mens rights activists showing up on womens boards with their usual objections. Some people like reading well written long posts and hers is so please back off.ampnbspThread starter my take is that youre dead right about her needing constant attention  especially romantic. Ive known a bunch of really cockfocused straight chicks who made allowances for pussy because they needed and got attention and emotional reinforcement from a gay woman. They were totally into the sex or relationships in the moment because right then and there it was giving them the affection they needed but youd better believe that when it comes along in male form they perk up like a dog thats sniffed its dinner.I would give off polite but cool vibes and try to distance myself. You need to find a way to stop her from tagging along at your business lunches.  Next time she makes a lesbian joke politely but firmly shut that shit down.  ,actuallesbians,cwmuiag,9,t5_2rch0

The existence of this petition further reinforces the need for the queer community at large to include the trans community in their activism as this attempt to hinder and exclude trans experiences furthers discrimination and disharmony within the queer community and mainstream society.

Most people around here know very little about nonbinary identities so I only say that when its relevant andor I am willing to explain that sex gendergender expressionsexual orientation arent all linked like most people think and that sex gender and sexuality are spectrums. When Im hanging out with more progressive people then I start off with that Im attracted to individuals not any particular group except for hot awesome and smart people if that counts.

5684165,0,t1_cx1nl1i,Youve been together for over  years  that is a long time. Are you both in it for the long haul? Have you talked about that sort of ultimate commitment? If so it would be best to address this out in the open now than to let it fester any more.   My first girlfriend was similar to yours in the sense that she was not the type to be making romantic gestures and was also not very susceptible to my attempts to discuss our sex life. She would always act offended or try to twist my words to make it seem like I was accusing her of something. It was not a healthy way for her to respond to my attempts at mature relevant discussion and in the end I couldnt stay with someone who wasnt willing to put forth as much effort in the relationship as I was.   Relationships just dont work when you cant be open and honest with your partner. You really need to bring up the topic in a sensitive way and start getting out your thoughts. It might get uncomfortable at times but that awkwardness will be worthwhile if it means getting past this rut for lack of a better word in your life together. ,actuallesbians,cx1oceu,1,t5_2rch0

5801063,0,t3_3umxto,I think the premise of the video is interesting and can be explored but the execution is lacking direction or identity. Whats the opinion of the creators concerning the topic? Briefly Id assume that its by having youtube and other social media outlets the LGTBQ community has had even more options to express themselves and connect.      You touch briefly on the downsides of such openness but dont commit one way or the other as the only assembled commentary and editorial are three short form interviews.      The topic could be pushed further and recognized through longer form interviews that are more than observations by the interviewee but empathetic responses to their own comingout stories  or even the narratorcontent creator. Its a very personal topic and more weight could be given to it if it had its own story rather than a bystanders.      Thats probably an unhelpful way of phrasing it. Hmmm. Is this an educational video or an emotional one? And it can have elements of both but I feel it fails to really connect on either for the majority. Id ask what is the point of this video? What should the final product say? Because right now to me it just says that youtube is a place to share stories and sharing stories makes you feel good.      How many comingout videos are there? How has this changed with the times with it being more accepted to come out? Or is youtube special in that despite all our progress are there still people who need a resource like this to connect and feel accepted? The dark side of opening yourself up to comments section because the release of admitting who you are is worth the pain. What do you as the creator think of all these questions? Do you have more to ask? Thats what I want to know.      And the video just left me wondering. ,actuallesbians,cxg6dtg,4,t5_2rch0

Gotta be honest that most of those non black call dudes would not be into marrying or even dating black women and some of the black ones had shady pasts but..the reality didnt matter cause those women wanted their whole checklist damn it!!  so they never gave anyone who only had one side a try.Its not so sad for some of them.

5937969,0,t1_cxx0sst,gtwhat the fuck is wrong with me that my partner fucking and having feelings for someone else makes me happyI think you need to look at it from a nonmonogamous point if view. You like seeing your partner happy with other people. Theres nothing wrong with that it just means youre secure with yourself and your relationship. It takes a long time to let go of the bullshit monogamous culture tells us is right or wrong in relationships because it doesnt apply to being poly. Also no offense but your mom sounds like an asshole and youd probably be better off not giving a fuck. If youre happy and your partners are happy why give a shit what she thinks? Instead of submitting to her emotional terrorism you can stand up to it. If she doesnt respect you and your choices then she doesnt have to be part of your life if you let her know that your presence in her life depends on her treating you like an adult. You dont even have to come out to give her that ultimatum.I got lucky with my mom. She isnt necessarily on board with my sexuality  but she understands that she cant do anything about it. She knows if she wants to maintain a healthy relationship with me she has to accept that I am who I am and Ill date who I date. ,actuallesbians,cxxzxyq,2,t5_2rch0

So she just straight up asked me if I was gay. I had been dropping hints for like a year at the point so I was really revealed she asked me and I told her yes. I got the Are you sure? How do you know? type questions. Nothing I couldnt handle. BUT THEN she tries to explain to me that I will miss out on the joys of having sex with men and tries to explain to me that I will have to use a strap on which could obviously just never possibly compare to the real thing. So I was basically like mom wtf and then she realized she was being weird and stopped. Thats basically the only remotely negative thing shes ever said to me about being a lesbian. She has said before that she fears for my safety since we live in Alabama. This was  years ago when I was  now Im  and my mom tries to point out girls in public that she thinks are cute.

6042602,0,t3_3y9k35,Hmmm yeah I can definitely imagine being jealous then. And even if I couldnt that you feel that way isnt terrible. Its all about what you do with the feeling imo. Jealousy is normal and human and kinda sucks but acting on it unwisely is what screws things up.As to what to do with it? My suggestions are these look at yourself and YOUR relationship with your girlfriend and get to know her best friend a bit more. I throw that first one out there because I notice that if Im jealous its usually more about something that I think Im lacking than about the actual relationship between the other two. If you and the girlfriend are in a solid place and you know it then youll perhaps be moved less by this other persons involvement in her life. And the second idea thats because knowing the friend will I suspect make them less of an unknown entity to you and therefore seem like less of a threatand if you happen to like the friend thatll set itself up opposite your tinges of jealousy.,actuallesbians,cybp07p,4,t5_2rch0

6103463,0,t3_3z3vv5,Thank you for the perspective to have it out of my head and actually see the damage lustcrush can do to my real life has shaken me up a bit. Her and her husband practice threesomes with men only and have done so happily for ten years. They have it worked out in quite a way that they are both happy with it. So it isnt really that I think my crush would lead to anything with her more so I want to get unstuck from obsessing about it. I know that requires talking to my partner first.That also means giving up the fantasy. My husband and I have been in therapy before and have made many attempts to deepen our emotional connection. It is improving. I tend to put too much pressure on him to fulfill my needs to talk so last year we talked about me trying to make more friends with women and broaden my network. So I made this one friend and other low level friends. And Ive felt happier and more balanced in what I need from him. Not as codependent. Then these other sexual feelings started coming in. I could go on and on but enough said. I will hold back.Someone asked about her she is hard to read because of her masculine energy and not being American but based on conversations she is totally hetero. And I think it is beside the point. I dont want to risk my relationship. Just need courage to talk to my partner. Thank you all! ,actuallesbians,cyjegs5,2,t5_2rch0
6110742,0,t1_cyjxx06,It would be pure luck to answer correctly without taking the test. Context is MBTI type these are not just simple questions about how you view yourself or something. So youd either have to know Carl Jungs theories about cognitive functions or have been typed by someone like me after long conversation. And frankly the easiest way to know your type is to kindly take that test. It is a bit more complicated thing than just simple are you feeling you are extroverted kind of question.But yes I think it would be better actually to reformat that question to only include types instead of individual letters words in this case of type. That way it would prolly be obvious for people that they actually cannot just pick what they feel they are but they must do the test and know their type before answering. So I think we agree here after all.,actuallesbians,cyk892k,1,t5_2rch0

Maybe kids is where the disconnect is happening as not having biological grandchildren is the only logical big deal reason I can think of for being so afraid of this.

I recently ended things with a new girl because although she was hot fit and seemingly intellectual she was horrible at texting. Every single text has multiple typos like she was texting with peanut butter on her fingers. It got to a point where I was like yeah no.... And another girl she was great... Had the whole Hannah HartCameron Esposito look total crush material.... and the conversation was good.... when she responded. Turns out she didnt like to read.... You want what you want so dont feel like a jerk for sparing others of trying to live up to your expectations.

6470806,0,t1_czom9do,If I may offer my view as a mathematician I see the word bisexual as similar in this to the adjective bijective. In math a bijective function is one that is both injective and exhaustive. But that doesnt mean we cant say they are only one of those. Like if a theorem has as conditions that the function is injective you can also just use a bijective one mentioning only its injectivity or its bijectivity as it implies the injectivity. Similarly I see the word Bisexual to mean a person is homosexual and heterosexual. So being homosexual and not heterosexual excludes you from being bi but being bi doesnt exclude you from being either homosexual or heterosexual. ,actuallesbians,czoml6q,1,t5_2rch0

That being said you need to make friends. Build some different connections. When you see a new show you like or think of something funny maybe text those friends and focus on building those friendships. I absolutely think you should consider signing up on okcupid or whatever app is best where you live if you see her profile just immediately hide it. Youre not there to think of her. See whats out there consider going on some dates and meeting people. As they say the best way to get over someone is to get under someone. Think of two achievable hobbies and devote yourself to them. Consider going back to school learning a language creating or building something you like or have an interest in. Set a lot of free time aside to work toward those hobbies. And at least one day each weekend meet up with a friend who isnt her andor go to a social event to meet people. It takes time but thats how you get your mind off her and refocus.

6508838,0,t1_czsfqpu,This is actually a big sticking point for me with Bernie supporters.  So many of them are so vocal and spit a lot of vitriol at Hillarybut how many of them are going to come back and vote in the mid terms?  If history is any precedent probably very very few of them. And thats what bothers me because that counts just as much as the presidency does.Look at what happened to Obama.  Hillary was the favorite going in and Obama managed to win on populist enthusiasm same as Bernie is trying to do.  But only two years later where were the same voters for mid terms? Republicans murdered Democrats in the midterms and theyve held the House ever since.  This was especially disasterous because every  years in the US we have a census which allows the districts to be redrawn. The tea party House then proceeded to gerrymander away and ensure theyd hold the House for the next decade ensuring they can obstruct a Democratic Senate amp President.  To make matters worse Senators that voted for the ACA in centristconservative states were voted out because their constituents arent very liberal.If Bernie is elected the same thing will happen except that he wont have  years of a Democratic congress like Obama did.  And as mentioned before he attacks the Democratic party so often hell have no one on his side.  One man cannot change a whole system our system was designed that way to protect so that one person doesnt have all the power. Because dictatorship and monarchy is bad  Its designed so that things are arrived at a consensus and Bernies not capable of comprimising only shouting platitudes at people hes supposed to work with.  Hell literally get nothing done and all the people all hot for him now are going to lose interest within a few months and say things like he sold out or something and not vote for awhile. ,actuallesbians,czskasl,3,t5_2rch0

Now that Im transitioning that hasnt really changed for me I do whatever the fuck I want and Im bristling at any suggestion that I have to fill some kind of gender role or be feminine to be a woman. I despise the very way society divides up things into masculine or feminine and would like it abolished altogether. Trying to fit into either box does not make sense to me personally.,actuallesbians,czt88q1,5,t5_2rch0
6515393,0,t1_czt64em,Im a trans woman and I wanted to be a drag queenor at least a very effeminate manback in the day because I didnt know anything about trans women or how much hormones could change ones body. Maybe people think I became transgender but I always felt the same of my body since before I knew anything about gender. Since I was a little kid in the late s early s. I dont think I was socially influenced to be this way its just a part of my being just like being attracted to women is or the fact Im Chinese and Irish. I really dont think gender is socially constructed because I would have wanted to be female even if I was born in  B.C. I put that in quotes because I do believe there is a biological basis for gender identity and having a female brainwhere my consciousness originatesmakes me yes biologically female on some level even without hormones. When people tell me genders just socially constructed theyre implying that Ive just decided to be a girl instead of taking into account my lifetime of fighting my own body because my brain kept believing there was something different there. Its a real mindfuck to keep thinking youve got a vagina each and every time before you look down only to not just not find a vagina but a penis there instead. Gender expression is socially constructed gender identity is innate.Case in point David Reimer a man whose botched circumcision led him to be constructed a vagina during infancy and raised as a girl with estrogen given to him to incite female puberty. He couldnt live as female and when he discovered what had happened he opted for testosterone treatments mastectomies and phalloplasty. He later killed himself. If gender was only a social construct he would have just recognized himself as female because he was raised female instead of always possessing his maleness despite his forced early transition. Even estrogen didnt change his identity.Im sorry for being so longwinded but I was raised religious and to be very masculine and Ive spent my entire life trying to get rid of the knowledge of my femaleness. My whole life after puberty has been willing myself not to commit suicide from my life spiraling ever downward due to my selfdenial. I feel I survived because of transition and just by the skin of my teeth so when I hear people might think I chose this or that I was socially influenced into this I get depressed at how no one will understand me no matter how much Ive suffered.As for the topic of this thread I see quite a lot of butch lesbians where I live which is East Tennessee. But maybe things are different elsewhere. I present sort of halfbutch with occasional boys clothes and not usually too much makeup if at all. A drag queen said I was a stemme girl half stud half femme. Sometimes I wear no makeup all guys clothes and my leather jacket to just fully butch it. I get very positive responses from gay girls about my looks. Im still not successful because most girls here quit talking to me or go into full platonic mode as soon as I mention Im trans. But at least with the butch or butch lite looks I have seen quite a lot of positivity that I think would have carried onward if I were cis. Again though Im in the Bible belt and Southern gays might have different standards of attractiveness.,actuallesbians,czt8qs0,25,t5_2rch0

6535883,0,t1_czukfkd,I ended up falling away from feminism actually once I began to come to terms with being a lesbian. The mainstream feminist movement was historically rather exclusive of lesbians and it was only in recent years that gay rights as a woman began to come into the picture. Even in modern times I began to see more and more how mainstream feminism was focused on the struggles of the heterosexual woman at the expense of ever considering homophobic misogyny. When I hear about feminism nowadays its mostly reproductive rights body positivity a rant for another time and rapesexual assault. Lesbians dont have to worry about birth control and abortion but when was the last time you heard about safe sex for lesbians? As far as rapesexual assault is concerned corrective rapesexual assault is a huge problem but it was never mentioned again perhaps it was my location but nearly all of the queer women I have known were victims of it at one point in life but still there was never any voice on these issues. When it came to anything off the straight and narrow again feminism seemed to be dominated by people with privilege. This is more an inflammatory subject where queer womens issues are concerned but all the most vocal feminists I came across IRL back when I was active as a feminist were not lesbians or trans women they identified as queerbipansexual but commonly had boyfriends or exclusively dated men. It was kind of alienating once I realized it. In my idealism as a feminist who hadnt accepted her sexuality I imagined feminism as being inclusive of all women focusing on all womens issues united under the common banner of providing a more equal world to live in but once I left the most privileged idea of being a straight woman I realized how untrue it was. So I left feminism and with it any TERF tendencies of course since that was connected to feminism for me.  ,actuallesbians,czvd2ih,6,t5_2rch0

6676172,0,t1_d09u2ei,I dont think the clothes are really the issue but I could be wrong.  I think the issue is that the identity this person feels comfortable with doesnt fall squarely into the traditional female role or the male role but is instead somewhere inconveniently between the two.  Society has trouble understanding that because its easier for the human brain to simplify things into a binary system or some other system of fixed categories  goodbad malefemale gaystraight.  Most traits exist on a spectrum.  I think its definitely possible to have some gender dysphoria without it being enough that you feel like you need to live as the opposite of your birth gender or take hormones or have surgery or whatever.  The line is different for different people.   So the problem really is societys rigid gender roles that are arbitrarily imposed on us and humanitys natural tendency to over simplify things.  Plus if youre already built up an identity as a lesbian it seems like it would be very difficult and possibly damaging to destroy that identity to become a straight man.  I dont see any need to try to force that on someone.,actuallesbians,d09vhbc,6,t5_2rch0

6849993,1,t3_49k14x,Wtf guys. This actually makes me really sad. Why are all of these activitiestendencies you are listing considered butch? If Im correct I take butch to mean masculine. So basically what we are listing here are traditionally associated with masculinity. However lets not perpetuate the belief that these things are only for men or that theyre masculine by default. Doing computer work buying hardware working out working on cars doing badass stuff like carrying heavy objects  that stuff shouldnt be considered masculine! Heck one person even listed fixing a watch as their butch activity of the day. Lets not associate being feminine with being incapable of fixing things! I get butch as applied to style. Masculine style is a thing deemed so by society. It doesnt really matter so much its more just a way to categorize what clothes most men and women will want to buy. But being strong and smart and interested in computers? Thats not masculine! So it surely isnt butch!endrant,actuallesbians,d0sr5oq,5,t5_2rch0

6908435,0,t3_4ad2wg,I think its very shortsighted when we ladies of the gay spectrum start talking about who has it worse. I think we end up talking over and at each other instead talking to each other and listening to one and other myself included. I do it too sometimes. There are some struggles that are unique or worse for lesbians some that are unique and worse for bi women and struggles unique and worse for trans lesbians and bis. But one doesnt have to be worse than another to warrant attention or being listened to. I feel like sometimes when we talk about something being hard for one group somebody from the other has to pipe in and say how their group has it worse or the person starting the discussion makes it an oppression olympics thing. I dont think it helps anybody and certainly doesnt bring us closer together. Also our communities vary from place to place. I spend a lot of time in the three different cities. Two are within two hours of each other and the third is six hours away in another state. The gay community is vastly different in all three and so is the acceptance we receive from the hetero community. In the main city I live in which is the smallest and a college city the L B and T is one big gay girl family and everybody knows everybody and frequents the same places and the general population is very gay tolerant. The city to my south is bigger but there is still a lot of overlap of gay women and its a somewhat gay friendly city. The third city which is a major city and very blue collar there is not as much overlap between LB women and T women and there are gay places and social groups where the Ts are not welcome and there is a lot of open homophobia and transphobia among the hetero population. So you know the women in each of those places will all have different experiences with acceptance and community. Being bi and trans I feel pretty good and like any other gay chick in my home city and for the most part in my second city but when I visit my sister and navigate the gay scene there I sometimes feel like a second class gay citizen even among other gays. In my home city its NOT expected that a lesbian date trans women but if she cant coexist and share space with the trans community shes gonna have a bad time and not have a lot of friends or a big support circle. So what she will have to say about acceptance and community will be much different.For you it is definitely harder navigating your world as a gay woman. For me? It depends on where I am. Whether or not its worse doesnt matter. Your struggles are just as real as mine and deserve just as much attention. I think thats the real problem here. I dont think lesbian struggles get the attention they deserve. I could care less if they are harder or easier. I know what its like to struggle so I dont want any of my sisters to struggle either.,actuallesbians,d0ze2v7,54,t5_2rch0

When women are in control they always know who their children are but determining a father is impossible without that overarching control over womens lives.Thats why virginity became a big deal the only way you could be sure a woman was having a certain mans child was if she never had sex before. This kept expanding till all aspects of womens lives were under control.Even in ancient societies where women had more control and we had birth control women shared higher status. As birth control and control over pregnancy wanes women have less power. Also we have genetic testing now so you always can find out who biological parents are so continuing to push virginity as a virtue is dicey at best.,actuallesbians,d1i1mwc,12,t5_2rch0

7184614,0,t1_d1ut8j9,I think I live in a different community than you do. Im in a queer volunteering organisation where any sexualgender identity is accepted included and fighting with and for each other. In a way that might mean that the family got bigger. Also the internet connects queer people all around the world which even if you dont know anyone in real life manages to convey the sense of community you need to come to terms with your identity. Yes there are people that just find their identity and then go on living their lives not bothering to become part of the community but even that is not a new thing its just easier today because being queer well gay mainly doesnt have to be a big thing anymore.What is sad however and something many of us are fighting is how split up the community is getting within itself. And I dont mean the diversity I mean stuff like transphobic homosexuals gay people treating bisexuality as just a phase nonbinary people being regarded as special tumblr snowflakes and so on. So yes the community is getting a bit split up because its really easy to just be gay and live a normal life than start sticking up for everyone else in the community as well but be aware that there are enough of us trying to combat this mindset. ,actuallesbians,d1uttbk,22,t5_2rch0

Anxiety is something that can get worse with time and its harder to break out of the thought patterns the longer it goes on. A therapist can help to tackle underlying problems such as a low self esteem cognitive behavioral therapy to look at your thought processes objectively and rewire them medication to help with an chemical imbalance and give you an aid to start your journey along with mindfulness meditation and stress management. Good sleep habits and diet are important too.Your anxiety will not be cured by avoiding things anxiety requires exposure to stand a chance of being free of it. My anxiety became a lot better once I started ignoring my panicky feelings and just done things and forgave myself if I fucked up. Its so easy to get caught up in Oh Im so panicky and worried this is bad! I shouldnt do this because I feel awful! And then fleeing from the uncomfortable situation. I got bad news for you it just reinforces the anxiety. We end up getting so caught up in a cycle of panicking about panicking that it can shut our lives down. I was quite ruthless in pushing myself and yeah I fucked up made a tit of myself and wish I wasnt such an idiot but  years on Im a lot better and Im amazed at my growth. Even in the last  months my friends new ones Ive made because Im braver! are amazed at my progress and they havent seen the whole transformation. Dont get me wrong I still chicken out and worry but not to the same degree or as often. Nice people will always give you more than one chance.Its heart breaking watching my loved ones lives slip by due to  anxiety theres little joy now and its a drain on me. Do yourself and your loved ones a favour be brave and make steps to overcoming your anxiety. Itll be the most frightening and courageous thing you can do but I promise you its worth it.

7276817,0,t3_4f280t,Im in a similar situation.... the person Im with doesnt necessarily want to see other people and doesnt want me to either. From what shes told me she just wants to take it sloooowww.I feel you  on this one... Ive basically told her that if she was dating other people it would hurt me and cause me to pull away from what we have. She has assured me she doesnt want to hurt me and were going to be completely honest with each other.  She sees us on a path but needs more time to get there. Maybe you want to clarify if this is your situation she needs more time takes things slow is slower to open up emotionally or if its something else. So yah focus on HONESTY. Being honest and asking her for the same. If the honesty involvs her saying I dont know or I just need more time or whatever then you need to decide how to either stick around for that and see if it will work out or decide to jump ship. I maybe like you tend to jump into things when I feel that connection... In the past that hasnt fully worked out for me so Im trying to be open minded about this new patient and slow method that the girl Im seeing is proposing. The only reason Im sticking around for this is because she tells me things like youre fucking awesome and is clearly really into me we have a connection and similar goals etc same things you described and because my gut feeling that says dont give up on this just yet. For my own sanity Im trying to like continue to focus on living my life. Honestly... its a bit refreshing to date someone who wants to take it slow. That may be your situation. I would definitely ask her about the Tinder thing though. Maybe shes just confused and needs some time to figure out how she feels. Either way... I feel your struggle. Im trying to take the viewpoint that maybe getting fully swept up in something is not necessarily healthy and that is may be better for like a healthier long term thing to develop if you take it easy. Different people have different experiencesideas of relationships too so its not fair to assume what others are thinking.Hope this ramble helps!,actuallesbians,d25bq5j,4,t5_2rch0
7277813,0,t3_4f2z3z,This kinda seems like looking for something to be offended about honestly. Lesbians complain all the time about women using them for experimentation purposes. So why is it an issue to give straight women a way to experiment with each other without hurting anyone. Frankly that quote seems perfectly fine to me. They say queer women are welcome. Awesome. They say its not usually their scene. Thats true I dont know any lesbians who would be into that. ,actuallesbians,d25ft1w,14,t5_2rch0
7277861,0,t3_4f2z3z,I think they mean that women who are already confident in their sexuality usually arent interested in being involved in experimenting.

7314538,0,t3_4fkdup,The love of my life lied to me for a month about something huge. She was talking to a girl online and developed strong feelings for her and she keep the whole thing from me. She looked me in the eyes and told me she loved me even while keeping this secret.I didnt mind that shed developed feelings since were both poly but the lie was very difficult to get over.Despite that I came to understand why she lied and I forgave her. I know that one lie doesnt mean shes a dishonest person.My point is that if you really love someone you will forgive them their screw ups if they are truly sorry and humble about it. We had to talk about it a lot before I was ready to start forgiving her. But I forgive her completely its not an issue at all and I dont trust her any less.You should say to your girlfriend something like Sorry for lying about my test. I dont know why I did that. Its not something I usually do. Please forgive me. I never want to lie to you.You can make up your own words of course but thats what I might say.What you are doing is showing you are regretful and feel bad about it and it gives her an opportunity to say anything shes been thinking. You may feel awkward but just show you are genuinely sorry and be humble about it. Its communication and its very important.This one little lie is not that big of a thing by itself but its possible shes now thinking what else has she lied about?The only way to fix that is by being transparent and communicating about it. It is definitely something you should talk about. Trust is so so important in a relationship and any threat to it no matter how small is serious. Thats what I think anyway.,actuallesbians,d29m3da,5,t5_2rch0

7350534,0,t3_4g0542,Im not on social media and this is a BIG reason why.  According to my gf who witnessed an absolute shit show last year when gay marriage became legal I was right to do it.  Now I get to avoid all this stupid political shit like antiLGBT memes and Sanders supporters repeating Fox News antihillary talking points amp conspiracy theories.You could also point out that even Donald fuckign TRUMP said HB was a bad idea and he didnt see the point in it. TRUMP. The guy who thinks we should deport all mexicans and keep muslums from entering the country.  He took the stance that they stand to lose a lot of business and have their economy suffer from the boycotts AGAINST HB.    These idiots you mention that want to boycott proLGBT businesses are fucking stupid because they dont realize that the number of people who either dont care or are proLGBT are far greater in number then they are.  They are just a very loud minority of usually religious bigots.  Its like that time the Million Moms tried boycotting Robinsons or Macys or something because they used Ellen in their commercials.  It backfired and Macys ended up making MORE money because of the controversy it generated and the backlash in which proLGBT ppl spent more in support of Macys.And this is a lesbian related thing too.  There was a link on here just a few hours ago about a more MOC or butchish lesbian getting physically thrown out of the womens bathroom by a male cop I might add because she didnt have any ID on her so therefore couldnt prove she was female.  This is a cis woman born female treated and talked to as a male using male pronouns just because she has the fucking audacity to wear mens clothes and have shorter hair.  Also IIRC HB not only included the bathroom portion but also a law stating that any business could legally refuse service to any LGBT individual.  So yeah that literally means if youre in NC and they see you and your girlfriend holding hands or being too close they can smell the gay and kick your ass out making a huge public shaming scene of you while doing it too.  It also means the poor lesbian who got kicked out of the bathroom cant do shit because they can just as easily say they were throwing her out because they dont serve lesbians where she was at.  It is a fucking LGBT witch hunt and its disgusting.,actuallesbians,d2dpepr,4,t5_2rch0

7476986,0,t1_d2s2utv,Hmm thats a horse of a different color. Dog has separation anxiety is far more difficult than to fix than basic training issues. On the upside there a little things you can do right now that may help his anxiety. You can give him a Kong or some other food puzzle toy to distract him when shes away. He will associate her absence will play time if you do it consistently enough. One way to convince her that therapy would benefit her dog not change his personality is if you set up a camera to watch his behavior when she isnt home. If she sees him being panicked and distressed when shes not there the comfort him then she may be more eager to find a way to treat the anxiety. Again you are going to have to make the argument for the dogs well being and comfort not your won. If she thinks you only want to do this for your convince she wont even try to compromise. If she thinks you want to improve her dogs quality of life then she may get on board. First step is convincing her that the dogs anxiety gives him a poor quality of life. Then convince her that you can repair his anxiety. Finally take it home with the theme that you just want him to be happy more often and that he shouldnt suffer like this when she goes out to be an adult.,actuallesbians,d2s39pm,3,t5_2rch0

It was then followed by the two girl emojis and hella gay since I was running into girls saying they almost didnt swipe on me because they thought I was a straight girl. Bios that worked well for meI cant say Id date you but Id probably fuck your sister.I want to tattoo the name of my one true love on my shoulder but I lost the barcode to my vibrator.I want to be witty but Im really just awkward.No crazy stories.

Youre not sure of things although I say that is a legit answer right there... doesnt need to be black and white.You love this man arent interested in exploring within boundaries of a threesome.ok. Whats the problem again?My wife is bisexual. I told her if she wants a play friend without me to go ahead. Disclaimer I know she doesnt ever want relationships with women so this was less complicated because its less likely to affect our relationship  status. And she has stayed out overnight width a woman.By extension Im free to go alone with guys if thats something I want to explore. I mostly like girls but Ive had serious gym crushes on guys. I can would and will find a FWB who understands.Why dont you feel comfortable showing him your post? Dont assume he would reject you. I mean if you want to break it off then that isnt negotiable but it seems like you want both worlds and so my whole point is you can but it doesnt have a chance if you dont take it and ASK.So if you want to find lady company then tell him and if you still want to maintain a relationship with him tell him THAT also!

Instead its a search or quest for a puzzle piece or pieces that fit yours. Turns out the you and the current one werent quite the right fit?

I dont always come back to the person I leave but the ones I really care about I do go back.  Its not fair to expect yall to continue to work with us and try with us after we leave.  Yall dont know were coming back and trust is so fragile.  Its too late for my relationship  but Im going back to therapy Monday.  She has to recognize her problem and want to fix herself and this realization needs to happen before she hurts you and loses you for good.  Her agreeing and actually commiting to therapy is part of the actionsgt words part.  Also what helped me some was talking my emotions through with my ex. She was able to talk me through my irrational thinking and logic me back into reality.  But Im sure that can get strenuous.

I feel that I dont really have a choice  I cant change my romantic or sexual orientation just because I might feel desperate. You have to ask yourself if this is something you really are or if your desperation is just making you into an existential masochist.I met my girlfriend because I asked her if she was interested. You cant just try to rely on passivelyacquired attention. Sure cismen are basically trained to fill the role of initiator and ciswomen are trained to wait for that attention. But if youre a lesbian you dont have to follow heteronormative rules at all. Ask friends try online dating. Theres a whole world out there. What you do in it is up to you I guess.,actuallesbians,d3whh9h,5,t5_2rch0

There are amazing hiking trails literally all over the country ranging from short to long easy to advanced. I can recommend the Tongariro Alpine Crossing or if youre feeling brave the Tongariro Northern Circuit which includes the Alpine Crossing. I can also recommend Rotorua its a pretty big tourist destination although it smells like ass no haterino.Thats in the North Island. In the South Island I can recommend heading to Queenstown another big tourist destination and the West Coast. The west coast is as beautiful as it is remote . Personally Ive been to the Punakaiki pancake rocks quite a few times.Also if you like Lord of the Rings you can go see a whole bunch of landmarks from the movies. Ive been to Mt. Doom Weathertop the rock where they CGId Minas Tirith Hobbiton and a couple of other places.ACTUALLY JUST GO EVERYWHERE. ITS ALL GOOD.Hmm I dont know much about the gay scene here though because I dont go clubbing. Apparently there is one though. I find gay people in NZ are pretty hypersexualized though which sucks edit Oh yeah I didnt talk about skiingsnowboarding. In the winter time Mt. Ruapehu and the Cardrona ski field are really good for that.edit Reading back it seems like Im trying to sell a trip to NZ to you or something XD.

7885924,1,t1_d427crw,Well I think you prove my posts overall point  do you define lesbian as being attracted to females the sex or to women the gender? If its the former then of course your response makes sense and youre right  if someones body isnt a match for what sex youre attracted to of course youre not being discriminatory. If its the latter as is often stated then it absolutely is transphobic  a woman is a woman no matter what genitalia or other features she has. When your preferences for the subset of women you are attracted to doesnt include those who happened to have been born with say nonwhite skin or a penis or any other uncontrollable feature then it is discriminatory. Socially acceptable discrimination? Maybe depending on which circles you run in but still discriminatory. Of course however if we drop the pretense that lesbians are into women and instead define it as being into females as the dictionary suggests then the cognitive dissonance of being into women just not those women goes away. I dont ask people to go against their preferences I just ask that preferences are defined accurately so that there is some logical consistency to them. Its hard to tell if you actually read my post but thats all I was trying to say. I will say however that the assumption that dating a trans woman who happens to have a penis would involve you enjoying or fucking their birth defect definitely seems like a transphobic one to me. Chances are neither party wants anything to do with it. Also I have known plenty of very gay men who have no problem dating vagina owning trans men so Im not sure what point you were trying to make. ,actuallesbians,d42g8jk,-1,t5_2rch0

7955316,0,t1_d49v9au,At risk of sounding insensitive I disagree completely.  Reactions after a tragedy are almost always from the most primal part of the brain.  After a massive tragedy society goes into reaction mode.  Politicians especially want to be seen doing SOMETHING.  They want to be SEEN and pushing legislation and soundbites and theories gets them into the news.  Theres an emphasis on speed as opposed to facts which leads to poorly crafted legislation which leads to partisan fights which leads to nothing happening.  Take it out of a gun control situation.  When a senior citizen causes mass injury by driving the initial impulse is to say Well they shouldnt drive! and try to get legislation passed to strip driving licences after a certain age.  The AARP objects people point out their Nana is  and drives every day people fight and nothing happens. If we discussed things like gun control outside of national tragedies I bet wed get a lot more accomplished with a lot more buyin from both gun owners and the gun lobby.,actuallesbians,d4a93bf,5,t5_2rch0

Sex therapy might even be a waste if shes not willing to try on her end. Im also wondering if she just needs to let the ticklish sensation pass? Just give it a moment and see if continuing with oral makes her ticklish the whole time? It could be an initial sensation...but not being the one in that situation I cant really say. She may also have to give up on getting oral from you. It may just not work out for her. Sounds like youre just fine at oral its not you.

8098089,0,t1_d4pw1jj,Thanks for the reply  Im always so happy on the rare occasion that I talk about my worries and get some understanding back. I can see why its appealing but I think Id prefer to not date someone with similar issues. I think maybe because I dont want to have to think or talk about it that much and want to be able to focus on something that hasnt consumed most of my life in such a painful and destructive way. I get really sick of focusing inwardly. On the other hand someone with similar issues is much more likely to understand in the first place so there would probably be much less explanation needed.,actuallesbians,d4qaqq2,3,t5_2rch0

8115196,0,t3_4qdp09,I think I can relate personally to what youre describing. I sincerely think that if you can take the time to seek out a good therapist who is  a right match for you and take the initiative to think and rethink about things in that context. Theres definitely more to feelings of shame embarrassment guilt etc. that are deeper rooted connections that you may not see at first. Its empowering I think to redefine and work through your own psyche to get to be who you want to be to take the reins. If thats not an option for you I guess Id suggest putting serious thought into the introspective and questioning whether you have a strong sense of self identity and why you allow other peoples perceptions to define who you areyour experiences. You have internet resources at least. Its also important to be patient and gentle with yourself. Chances are you wont feel completely different tomorrow and even though people tend to reference the s and longgone days when talking about gay acceptance you cant expect people to be completely unaffected by homophobia. That does NOT reflect any kind of shortcoming about you. Id say allow yourself a right to feel your own feelings because theyre there for a reason and the only way to make them go away is to work through them. Youre not a child for having these feelingsproblems  youre a human being with your own personal experiences and your own personal lessons to learn in your life.Also if you continue in a certain way of living thinking or a certain environment you will reap the same results. Youre not going to be able to keep doing one thing forever and just magically get the change you want. So if you can in whatever living situation youre in Id say try finding what you think will affect you positively. Look at what you can do in your own life and try to assess if the way youre looking at something is irrational. For example personally if a girl is very friendly with me I dont assume that shes gay. I might think that shes just very outgoing and I would even admire that. If thats my personal outlook theres probably a lot of other people who share that opinion. Usually other people arent seeing what we think they are because were already looking for that were in that paranoid mindset of thinking someone is staring at your zit thinking youre ugly that youre gay whatever it may be. And if someone does think that you are gay what then  what does that do? And from there what does a positive or negative reaction do? If someone is homophobic thats their problem not yours so how does the way that this person lives their life define you? Hopefully you might find that what youre so scared of isnt so scary and big at all if you face it. Good luck OP!,actuallesbians,d4s7zil,10,t5_2rch0

8157883,0,t3_4qx11d,So I was  just transitioning to public school from being homeschooled for grades . I was earnest shy and awkward. My th grade Latin teacher was this enthusiastic twentysomething ball of fire and I fell hard. She was also really cute but I didnt pay any attention to that. I just like really looked up to her you know? Snort.So obviously because I respected her teaching skills and subject knowledge so much I wrote her a gushing letter two weeks into the school year full of admiration for what a great teacher she was and how nice she was and how pretty she was !!!.She was very sweet about it it probably helped that I was an excellent student and she wrote me back. She wrote me a fullpage letter in which she informed me that she had just found out she was pregnant and asked me to keep it secret for a while because she hadnt told any other students yet. Unsurprisingly I was over the moon. I treasured my secret knowledge jealously. But I also treasured the letter. To the point where I kept it in the front pocket of my threering binder and read it religiously EVERY MORNING FOR THE WHOLE SCHOOL YEAR. You know like a normal heterosexual child. O.oLater on I wrote her awful flowery poetry full of really obvious classical mythology allusions and went back to my middle school several times to visit her. Oh and I also decided to keep taking Latin because of her instead of switching to French as I had originally planned. And I begged to be her student assistant for my second semester of th grade instead of someone elses. ALSO also I had several sensual and interesting dreams about her that were definitely intriguing only because I so rarely had dreams about real people. Not because she came to my house to see me while my parents were gone. Or because she was wearing a lowcut shirt. Or because it seemed like we might kiss at one point. I had a similarly overthetop crush on my high school Latin teacher which involved casually riding my bike past her house for at least an hour solid before she noticed me and invited me in to have coffee with her and her husband. Plus more terrible poetry. Plus more interesting dreams. facepalm,actuallesbians,d4xa7wl,9,t5_2rch0

8185669,0,t3_4rfmmz,I have zero patience for that Im shy too but when it comes to dating and meeting someone new I can ignore the nervousness and at least carry a conversation. There was one girl I went on a date with who is a really cool girl weve become friends and talk on facebook occasionally now but  minutes into the date of mainly me talking and trying to think of topics with her short responses I already decided I was done and how much longer this had to go on before I could go home without being impolite. I think people with a strongdominant personality could probably keep that kind of date going but a shy person with a really shy person makes for a pretty lame first date at least it is based on my experiences. Im lucky my girlfriend made all the first moves which I am so grateful for like I would hate to date someone like me nothing would happen! So yeah absolutely nothing wrong with shy girls but I think the other person needs to not be shy for it to work. Im sure there are exceptions but generally I think thats how it is. ,actuallesbians,d50rcic,2,t5_2rch0

Were friends again after being out of touch for a while. Im helping her with her wedding invitations. She slept w a few girls after me but has only seriously dated men since then.

I hate seeing someone lead with hey or whats up so I always look for something intriguing in their profile a favorite book or movie or something we have in common and  of the time start with a question about it. Sometimes that works usually it doesnt but the effort is there.The last few conversations Ive had that werent complete busts were because I gave them my number same day or the next day but it hasnt progressed very far beyond that. I like to think of myself as engaging and witty but it can be like pulling teeth sometimes. I was talking to someone who only answered my questions never asked any in return that gets old quick you know?I realize Tinder is not optimal and I am looking for genuine connections but I figured leave no stone unturned or whatever that phrase is.

She played with my emotions made out with me when we were drinking only to deny it ever happened when we were sober... I watched her obsess over boys that treated her like shit lose her virginity to and sleep with assholes.  Meanwhile I was there for her every step of the way.  She completely flipped out with jealousy when I came out to her and had my first girlfriend.  She couldnt handle it.  Not because she wanted to BE with me but because she wanted me there as her trusty faithful sidekick.  Maybe a part of her was in love with me too but she couldve never given me what I need in a relationship because her mother is too overbearing and pressurey about her being with menmarried to a man.We rarely talk anymore and I have since moved on... many times and am in a happy relationship now.  In my opinion it isnt healthy to wait around for unrequited love for someone to change their mind because it likely will never happen.Move on and meet new people.

8471333,0,t1_d60frx0,I dont know about soccer so I cant comment on that. But I dont think the roles in a soccer team really relate to a subreddit moderation team.I think the community is likely to vote for A known trusted community members and B people who answer the application questions in a pleasing way.What is most important is who is the top mod. Because that person can remove a mod if they start displaying TERF tendencies. It could easily be set that the top mod is a known community member and is a nonTERF.It may be true that it is difficult to objectively say who is a TERF and who is not but were leaving that judgement up to the modsobservers anyway. They can still make that judgement on who the community chooses.In terms of having a good team well are neutral observers any more likely to choose a good team? They cant determine personalities either actually I think the community will be far better at choosing a good team because people will have a better knowledge of who they are and what they are like.The issue is that this subreddit has long term chronic issues with community dissatisfaction with moderation. Every other time existing mods have chosen the new mods. That approach clearly hasnt worked. This new alternative idea of having outsiders help choose mods is to me very risky.Another advantage of having the community vote is it makes the community accountable for who is elected. If the community has issues with new moderators its the communitys own fault we cant blame neutral observers or old mods or whatever. We can take ownership over our communal decision.,actuallesbians,d60ggpo,1,t5_2rch0

I went on tinder with the intention of looking for casual dating so like someone I could go on dates with do cool stuff with but I didnt want a relationship because I thought the dynamic wouldnt be right. Started talking to this girl within my first  hours on the app clicked so well with her that I asked her to be my girlfriend at the end of our first date a week and a half later  massive massive uturn on my part but basically she made me realise that I was bullshitting myself about not having relationships with women and the idea of not being with her felt so wrong.

Suddenly Alyssa is bisexual and was sexually promiscuous and has a past and doesnt seem to know what she wants and Im like so she doesnt know who she is? And thats something many girls deal with that they dont know who they are but its too much for the movie.

8778270,0,t1_d72wexp,Here I copied and pasted my main response of why I hated the moviegtwhy would you expect that of the movie in the first place? Its a movie by a straight man whos never billed himself as any kind of queer voice. Its a movie from  which was at the start of the modern gayrights movement and well before gay marriage was legal anywhere.The date at which it was made is irrelevant as to whether or not it fits my subjective tastes of being a good movie or not. Could a movie be good for its time? Maybe. But that does not give it enough leverage for me to like it nor find it relevant for modern times.gtI dont believe that its fair to call it a shit of a movie or that being disturbed and disgusted to the core is a fair reaction to it.Let me ask you a question do you think it was a coincidence that the fluid person in question was a lesbian who was entranced and seduced by an average straight men? Do you really think it was coincidental that the director didnt employ a gay man in the role of the seducer of a straight man? I dont think it is. This is where we are reentering this territory of negative messages being spout about the community. Why must it always be a fluid lesbian as the seduced and a straight man as the seducer? Sure it happens but in this case I genuinely feel that it was intentionally made to appease the straight male viewers while throwing lesbians under the bus.Let me ask you this think of the likeliood of this a woman born and raised in a heternormative environment that praises encourages and indoctrinates her from her birth that she must marry a man to be a productive member of society ..who has to then come out as interested in women after realizing that she is not what she is supposed to be...and then decides after all this that she should sleep with this one average straight man who happens to be the main character of the movie. This to me really seems like the story plot.vs.the likelihood of a girl who did what was good and and tried to be straight then realized that she was actually a lesbian.Which story is really more representative and relateable to our community? Which can be somewhat damaging to our community? Which would lesbians on average relate to more?I dont know about you but this constant message that lesbians just need the right dick is so nauseating to me it got me kicked out it got me isolated it got me in danger. So you better believe that it would bother me when out of all the possible movies supposed to represent me I have one thats going to reinforce these negative messages.Finally the characters are bland. The dialogue is boring. The realism of the whole representation of the lesbian community is weak.,actuallesbians,d72yb7y,-1,t5_2rch0
8782042,0,t3_50eegy,Im for both cats and dogs personally.But to answer your question without being in the gutter sometimes I think its because cats are fiercely independant and strongwilled which are two qualities that resonate within our community. Theres a connection to cats in the sense that they too get discriminated against for being the way Mother Nature made them  my cat doesnt harm wildlife but if he sees a mouse its on.

8782422,0,t1_d7319z7,I kinda disagree that the fact that you work with people of color should be your selling point. The selling point is that what she said was racist and you prefer not to associate with racists posts. Taking away from that pretty much shifts the focus to pocyour liberal friends in this example as being too sensitive ie. saying maybe the post isnt racist but people might be hurt from it. I think its fine to draw a hard line here and add the job stuff in as a compounding part of your issue with the post. gtI also think its a racist term that a lot of white people use disparagingly to describe typically black neighborhoodsYou pretty much summed up there. If shes unwilling to listen to this it kind of comes across as her being deliberately obtuse. Or racist. Either way its definitely an issue that shes unwilling to be empathetic to things that affect you. Good luck with everything!EDIT  gtMy friends are racists and were being racist on social mediaId also reflect on why youre willing to call your friends racist but not your girlfriend.

Everyones preferences are different. Everyone is different. Even the way people communicate is different. People who have had sex a thousand times can be just as anxious as someone whos never had sex.My advice chill the heck out.

8875227,0,t1_d7el4kw,There are trans women who while female still prefer to behave sexually as a male i.e when having sex with their partner they derive pleasure from associating themselves as masculine. This does not mean that all lesbians with female genitalia who use toys for penetration are associating with a masculine identity sexually although some do.  In some cases of sexual identity a person uses these binaries anonymously with dominant and submissive and in some cases they invert them and in other cases they are fluid and shift or do not apply altogether.  Again it is a matter of preference and not something that I am saying is defined either by biological association or by preferred gender identity.  It is merely a question to ask a sexual partner without judgment or expectation to discover how best to relate to them sexually.While I realize that male and female and masculine and feminine can be offensive to some individuals who find them binary or restrictive we still use them in sex education because there those who associate sexual pleasure and sexual identity with a certain gender or binary despite having a socially separate or distinct sexual identity. But in no case did I imply a totality.  Gender is how we view ourselves.  It is not restrictive to our biology.  But there are cis striaght men and women cis gay mean and women and trans men and women who will occasionally have one gender with which they approach the world and want the world to view them and a separate gender with which they associate with sexually. In that regard it is perfectly normal for a trans woman to be female but in having sex to view herself in western masculine terms to associate the penis as a part of herself and to form a sexual identity from that perspective which does not extend past sexual experiences. And again that is not the experience of all trans women but it is an important question especially in establishing what in the OPs case would make her partner most comfortable sexually. female male masculine feminine heteronormative  these are all social constructs which can be fluid and which can shift but it does not mean that they are inherently negative and there are people who in some or all areas of their life enjoy defining themselves by their traditional definitions and others who enjoy discarding them altogether all of which is completely fine. ,actuallesbians,d7eodzu,1,t5_2rch0

She might switch a bit to fresh fruit and more fresh vegetables and drinking water and tea instead of high sugar drinks .Taste and smell of the vagina are influenced by nutrition and by ph value etc.It is possible to use probiotic pessaries like intrafresh or femina flora they install healthy bacteria which help keeping infections out and can make for a good taste ... also eating organic unsweetened yoghurt from time to time ...and nutrition has an influence ... eating pineapple or drinking pineapple juice a day or two before can make a big difference ...also cutting  a bit down on coffee smoking and fast foods ... they also have an influence on body odor ...maybe you can talk about this in a way suggesting a few positive changes and for example having fruit juice and fresh fruit etc available  ...hugs,actuallesbians,d7h5a19,11,t5_2rch0

8936053,0,t3_52g2vv,Just my perspective. I cut all my hair off this year. I am a very feminine lesbian and I held a lot of my identity in my hair. I had never had short hair  so the thought definitely frightened me. But at some point I had this earth shattering realization that I didnt want anything to have so much control over me that I couldnt feel like myself without it. I needed to be able to love my identity no matter how my hair looked. Because who knows what the future holds. As an actor I one day could be offered an amazing role that would require me to shave my head. Would I be able to live with the person I saw in the mirror everyday after that? I would never want that to keep me from taking the part. Or maybe not to be morbid one day I could get sick and lose my hair. Point is I just decided that I wanted to be able to be myself no matter what my hair looked like. So I said fuck it. I wanted short hair in that moment and I wanted to be more recognizably gay to other women so I shopped it ALL OFF. From below my boobs to pixie Mohawk. And damn it was liberating. I totally recommend it. It is scary not going to lie but it does grow back. Promise. And you could find out that you look fiercer than ever with short hair! Also I have a super lesbian cut now. Still get hit on by guys and have people surprised that Im gay. Youll be fine I promise. ,actuallesbians,d7lzcfh,2,t5_2rch0

8996821,0,t1_d7t01ce,I guess I am kind of selfish you are right but the reason why I insisted is because it really isnt clear if she wants it or not. I wouldnt press on it if it was clear she doesnt. Some people dont do too much talking and its hard to figure them out especially her because she tends to play games. Sometimes it honestly feels like she is waiting for me to try it again. Yesterday confused me even more just as I was starting to accept that she might not be interested I was eating her out and she asked me to slide in a finger then she asked me for two then she came. Im even slightly embarrassed I made this topic in the first place if anything it proves how desperate I am. I think its funny that when we post personal questions on the Internet people instantly judge you as if they had a clear picture of the situation which they obviously dont. My girlfriend is a very complex person with tons of insecurities many of the comments here made me think about the way I am dealing with this but I dont think I am wrong by trying to talk to her about it.

9093378,0,t1_d84r8ta,Sounds like you have a lot of resentment towards your high school teachers for not standing by your side and supporting you. Its unfortunate that you werent given that support and Im incredibly sorry that was the case but that does not make it okay for you to lash out at me and take your built up resentment for your teachers out on me. I had a talk with my kids today about human rights regarding all minority statuses and spent a good amount of time talking about LGBT kids. We discussed my policy on bullying and discrimination and that I will not tolerate any of it. I was fortunate enough to graduate from a high school that was  Latino  Asian  black and  white. I exposed to so many cultural differences sexual orientation differences and religious differences and I told my kids today that it was a true privilege. gtEither make a difference or dont just dont put lipstick on a pig so you can sleep better at night. This hurts. Teachers especially first year teachers are under an incredible amount of stress and pressure to fit in and mingle among other teachers and thats hard to do when all of your colleagues are married and you cant even mention that youre in a serious relationship because its with someone of the same sex. Its not my choice to stay in the closet and keep my mouth shut as much as possible. Its my reality because I want to hold on to my job for next year. Its self preservation. Try not to be so judgmental of a world you may or may not understand. Education is all politics unfortunately. ,actuallesbians,d84vmdm,1,t5_2rch0

9230438,0,t1_d8lzk7o,Gee you really spent a long time on this. I feel bad now. Since youve devolved into personal attacks I think our conversation is over. Im going to ahead and admit that after the first paragraph of your rant I stopped reading I  assume you never got around to saying anything of actual substance. Next time you argue with someone if you want to actually have a chance of changing their opinions try not to attack them like a child. They might actually listen to you then. Dont forget that people constantly attacking Trump is exactly what made him so popular. This strategy only works against you and its amazing that after a solid year people still dont realize that. Of course I doubt your goal was ever to try to convince me of anything anyway. You want to feel like you won in an attempt to validate your own political beliefs to yourself. Well feel free to take the last word on this you can claim that victory all you want. I never believed I had even the slightest glimmer of hope that I would convince a single person in one of the most hardcore liberal spaces on the internet my goal here was just to show the anonymous Trump supporters of this subreddit that they are not alone. They might be afraid to admit it because of people like you but they certainly exist. Isnt it ironic? I have no problem telling everyone I meet that Im gay but I am terrified of the social backlash of admitting I am a Trump supporter. Its like being in the closet all over again except this time its my lesbian sisters attacking me for not being a part of their hive mind. Funny how quickly people can devolve into being just like those they despise. God forbid someone have a different opinion than you or different political beliefs than you.

9296342,0,t1_d8u16a1,I never said it doesnt happen. I said its not the norm among the actual poly community. It happens a lot with people who are very inexperienced and   dont make an effort to be a part of the larger community. Im not saying theyre not really poly. Im saying theyre not part of the poly community because once they get plugged in the more experienced ones usually set the baby polys straight after a while. We are annoyed by unicorn hunters just as much as you are. And most of us dont date them. Im sorry you did it  times. They usually have to go outside of the community to find someone who will date them because people within the community know better. Im also not trying to sweep it under the rug. I said its inexcusable.But all of that misses the point of my response to you. Im none of the things you had a bad experience with. Im not a unicorn hunter. Im not trying to break anyone up. Im not trying to date a mono person so I wouldnt even be interested in trying to date someone like you in the first place. I said I filter out to only even see people who are already poly on my profile. My post was about a specific gender expression and not even about poly at all. I said Im having a hard time getting attention from butch women. Some butch women are poly and those are the ones Im having trouble with because I dont even see the mono ones. Of course its anyones right not to date me lol. What an odd comment btw I was just trying to get some perspective on reasons for that. And the reasons are unfortunately pretty biphobic. Someone who has ever had sex with a man is a major turn off? And you with the whole unicorn hunter thing thats completely irrelevant to my situation?

I responded to your post because I know that people tend to answer posts that they relate to and I knew there were going to be many people answering to the affirmative in your post. I wanted to provide a difference of opinion while still remaining true to my own personality. I didnt respond how you think I shouldve because I dont respond to people like that in real life.

Rather than spend a bunch of time getting to know someone and slowly approaching the subject of commitment rule out the party girls early by bringing it up early on. Theres nothing wrong with telling someone thats what youre looking for just like theres nothing wrong with only looking for short term relationships.I know it doesnt sound convectional. A lot of people prefer to try to seduce someone into a long term relationship get to know each other and see if your compatible and all that and then sort of organically fall into a relationship.

A lot of the people I know who are tired of the just eat right and exercise! advice are tired of it because eating right is pretty expensive and so are a lot of forms of exercise. Itll work for some people but it certainly isnt for everyone. ,actuallesbians,d92kns9,9,t5_2rch0

9364862,0,t3_58qjg1,You know Im going to be that girl and say that I probably wouldnt immediately join a fitness club for gay ladies just because Im not in any fitness clubs in general and it would be hard to schedule. I have weight and health issues going back to childhood and my adopted family are my biggest supporters in trying to make changes todayI dont really feel the need for much more than that. Plus I dont know if I would have anything in common with these people other than an interest in other women! What I would be curious about is WHY American lesbians have this issue assuming its accurate that they do I saw another comment saying the findings were highly disputed but I dont know any details. Are we so sensitive to being judged by homophobes that were especially inclined not to listen to mainstream advice about our health? Are we more inclined to distrust medical professionals? Are we even less comfortable than the rest of the population in making uncomfortable lifestyle changes which require us to act counterintuitively because of how society has urged us to do the same thing regarding the people we love?Im really curious and Im the type of person that views more knowledge as more power so... thats probably what I would be most interested in seeing. ,actuallesbians,d932ahd,4,t5_2rch0

9672738,0,t3_5dkr4x,Its so hard being in that situation. I dont pity you I simply understand you. When I was rejected by the person I thought I was head over heels in love for I developed major depression and had suicidal thoughts. I too have terrible selfesteem and figured they rejected me because of how ugly I am. What else could it possibly be? Were friends they should like everything else about me!Well if you think about it its not fair to assume that of another person. They can have any reason they want. What you assume is just your insecurity.You may feel worthless but that doesnt mean you are. You have worth among your friends and coworkers and what you produce through your hobbies. Sorry to repeat things youve probably heard before but its important be okay with being alone. Just dont continue thinking its your destiny to be alone the rest of your life. All that means is put less of your worth on being in a romantic relationship.I hope Im not too forward with all my advice its just I used to really identify with a lot of the thoughts youre having. Our lives are different I wont pretend were the same. But I hope I can give you a little perspective from someone whos been there personally. I never had a relationship until I was  and it totally blindsided me when it happened. It may sound cliche but the future is never decided. No one can tell you your future with  certainty not even yourself. Even something as innocuous as Im going to work tomorrow can turn into a different plan entirely when life throws a curveball at you.And please dont give up on counseling maybe its not working for you in terms of how you feel about relationships but if youre struggling with anxiety or depression at all you deserve some support.,actuallesbians,da5d91o,7,t5_2rch0

9680629,0,t3_5dpjyx,Well I slowly came out to a few select gay friends. Just before graduating there was a party. Long story short a bunch of horny teenagers all making out on a bed five girls and one guy. Me and one other girl were basically in threesome mode with this guy who was also a close friend of mine. She was the first girl I kissed. That was my first encounter but I wasnt out. It was just experimenting. Soon after I began talking to this girl I met in powderpuff senior football we realized each others sexualities and she wanted to kiss me right off the bat. I was scared and it was in a fairly public place my car in a parking lot in the middle of the day at the gym EVERYONE goes to and I chickened out. We started talking I took her on a date over the summer but I generally acted cold towards her. I made out with her at a party in front of her now girlfriend and I was pretty salty when I missed out on her when they became official. I deserved it though I was hot and cold with her. After that happened I slowly came out to some other friends... almost none of them were particularly close. A few had known since I was like  but most of my friends did not know. I had quite a few friend groups in HS so it was hard to have told more than the select few who knew. I joined GSA senior year and I was out to those kids but it was hard keeping it a secret from my parents and other friends.Anyways in my first year of college I established my schools first GSA with a friend from HS. One day I was feeling brave and tweeted its funny how everyone thinks im straight. Flood of texts from friends mostly supportive. Some of my male friends thought it would be funny to convince me to come back but it was all in good fun. Coming out that way was easy. and I felt sooo much better. My mom didnt know until two years later four months into my relationship. I was at lunch with her and we never go out to lunch together. She had brought up a man I used to date and I finally told her I wasnt dating him anymore because I was dating a girl. I told her I was bisexual and had been in a relationship for over four months. She was supportive. I didnt tell my father until a month later he lives a state away for work and I chickened out when he came to visit.

The secret to working with acrylics is use a retarder that will slow down the drying time and let you blend more easily. Id recommend gouache for beginners.

Yeah you can know of some people who are queer but I have not seen the first PDA that doesnt involve drunk people. There are a few LGBTQ spaces that have been vandalized.This year an Ambassador was attacked relentlessly just because he went to a school to talk about his job accompanied by his husband. He recently said he was quitting and Im positive the peer pressure was one of the main reasons.Funny thing is though although any kind of homosexuality is frowned upon and judged I feel that lesbians and bisexual girls are more likely to be attacked in any form than gay guys. Kind of they are more accepted than wlw. I mean its easier to see a guy out than a girl they have steady jobs even on television and I have personally heard dozens of people say that some gay men are born that way but girls cannot really be like that.

Little puberty ridden teens are wishing so hard upon a star to grow up and be able to do all the things you have the potential to do now.Knowing you like girls in HS doesnt really change much except youve recognized all those straight girl crushes as theyre happening which are even more agonizing at that age youre much more angsty about everything youre way more terrified of the fact youre different when all you want to do is fit it and youve kissed a few more girls maybe.,actuallesbians,db7c1xr,4,t5_2rch0

The vast majority of people have no idea what their chromosomes are the primary way it is assigned is a brief inspection of the genitals at birth and outside of humans sex loses even more meaning. Its just a way of using outdated jargon to other trans women.

They were originally used by straight people to shame gay people or to talk down to them good examples are in those weird s PSA videos they used to make.But then the LGBT community reclaimed the word so if a gay person uses the word queer to refer to themselves it removes it from being a derogatory term. Think back to the s Riot Grrrl movement when a couple singers would write derogatory names on themselves like slut Its a way of owning the word. So yeah a gay person can use those words but a straight person saying shit like ew thats gay well they need to gtfo.Edit please correct me if Ive said anything wrong here guys its been a million years since Ive read anything on these topics. ,actuallesbians,dblrb91,2,t5_2rch0

10148381,0,t1_dbu6ylm,Why isnt Fallon Fox dominating her weight class then?I guess when she wins itd cause shes trans and when she loses its because she isnt that skilled...?   How do you even keep that cognitive dissonance from driving you nuts?The fact is that any athlete is going to have innate advantages owing to their unique physiology.  The potential advantages a trans woman might have are going to be par for the course when youre talking about elite athletes.  There are mutations that allow for people to carry more oxygen in their blood.  Thats a HUGE advanatage certainly bigger than any variation youll find in trans women.  Should people with that mutation be banned?   What about tall cis female basketball players the kind who are like .    That is a MAJOR deviation from the norm and Ill bet money it was a result of puberty just like a trans woman with the same height.  Both are sample sizes of  as literally everyone is different.   What makes the functional difference between the two?    The only answer is that one is trans.  That its ok for this woman to be tall because she was AFAB its natural variation at work but that woman is too much of an outlier because she was AMAB. Once on HRT for a certain amount of time the advantages a trans woman might have are no more significant than natural variation youd find within cis womenESPECIALLY if that woman is a pro athlete.  Dont take my word for it look up the IOCs rules and the research behind them.   Its not like there arent fighting events at the Olympics you know.  Hell my old Taekwondo instructor was on Koreas team when it was a demonstration sport and I remember him wanting to hide video of him aciddentally delivering a knockout spinning hook kick to an opponent since he was afraid it would scare off children and parents.,actuallesbians,dbuc4m9,14,t5_2rch0

10203198,0,t3_5m3q1x,I think about it less as an age thing and more like a power dynamic thing. Five years can mean very little if youre both at the same stage in your life but quite a bit if one has for example been out of college for a year or two and the other is just beginning college. Everyone hits these stages at different points so its hard to say what the maximum difference is. I was in a relationship with someone who was only two years older than me we were both over  to be clear and her friends gave her a hard time about it whereas I was in a relationship with someone four years younger than me and all of my friends supported it. I think a lot of beliefs surrounding this have to do with your culture experience social systems etc. In general queer people seem to be a bit more flexible about it possibly because we dont feel the need to stick to social norms?,actuallesbians,dc0l8i6,10,t5_2rch0

10338374,0,t3_5nys3a,Its totally common to feel insecure about dating and sex its more personal and emotional than most things in life so of course people worry about it. Youre hardly the only one.If I had any advice its that you dont need a pass for inexperience because theres nothing youd need forgiveness for. Dating and sex dont need a lot of technical skills to have a good time and the other person genuinely wants you to enjoy yourself and is probably feeling insecure themselves too. It can be anxietyladen to decide when to open up about doing something more intimate when you start dating but if youre in doubt its usually less awkward to ask in context than you might imagine. The good news is that theres not a lot of things that inexperience would make you screw up during basic sex anal and BDSM do need advice about safety tho. People tend to like sex with people theyre into and they usually like experimenting showing new things talking about it being asked for things etc. They wont get impatient with you if youre still participating and communicating its not like being stuck in line behind a really slow customer at the store.,actuallesbians,dcfwvse,2,t5_2rch0
10340449,0,t1_dcets8b,I hadnt really considered it as experimentation. It wasnt a thing I experienced so I never thought about it.  We have talked about the fact that it is hard to get girls to take her seriously when she says she likes them or want to go out with them. She laughs about it but I know its frustrating.  The idea of this girl only experimenting would crush her I think. It is still too fresh. It concerns me a little the way she has held onto it. She still talks like they might get back together some day.  Her dad and I dont see that happening.  The thing is I still think the girl is great just young and they are now  states away form each other.  The thing is they are both young. We are trying to keep her focused on getting into the college program she picked. She has visited more than once and it is open and awesome. I told her when she passes her upcoming early entrance exam I will take her for another visit. A few years seems like a long time when you are young and lonely though...I worry my husband and I wont be enough.,actuallesbians,dcg5d84,3,t5_2rch0

10387563,0,t3_5ord5j,Im not a doctor but Im thinking there could be various reasons for this. Apologies if any of this is too indepth no pun intended lol!It might be that youre just still new to it and youre still quite smalltight. That could depend on age or even just how youre made! Ive been with girls who only like one finger one didnt want any penetration at all another who needed warming up from one to two or even three and someone else who liked just going straight in with . Everyone is built and wired differently none of those mean anythings wrong with them of course It could also be that the other personpeople were a bit rough as you say. Especially for your first few times I personally think its important to start off slowly and gently. But thats just me.The other thing could be that youre just not relaxed enough. Are you clenching up? Clenching up feels like when you stop pee halfway through. See if you can practise clenching up and letting gorelaxing those muscles Kegel muscles I think theyre called?. Clenching up too much when somethings inside you can be painful so when you get to know how to relax those muscles that may help.Dont let it put you off. Id actually recommend masturbating aside from the obvious nice things about it it gets you learning what you like what you dont like and where the nicenot so nice places are on yourself. Obviously you wont have access to the same angles that a partner would fingerwise but it might help you relax into it.Then again I could be completely wrong! If youre really concerned and you feel the above doesnt apply Id probably discuss it a doctor and see what they say. I hope you manage to get it sorted because its not meant to be painful its meant to be a reeeally nice experience! Good luck Also as for the oral it could be someone going too hard with their tongue or even teeth. Direct contact with the clit can be very sensitivepainful depending on how turned on you areif you even LIKE direct contact! Some people dont because its too much. Could also be that your partner wasnt very experienced or was just like a bull in a china shop lol! Slowly and gently wins the race. Always feel free to communicate with the other person if its not feeling good. Edit Added the bit in brackets.,actuallesbians,dclhu0c,6,t5_2rch0

10425503,0,t3_5papso,So Im similar to you I considered myself bisexual before realising I was gay Im also a bigger girl but with a face that doesnt match my body. I found the biggest source of my rejection wasnt that I was big its that Id been bisexual and not long come out of a relationship with a man. Lesbians were particularly uncertain about that because it made them feel like I might be looking for an experiment. I found this especially on Her and Plenty of fish. As soon as I swapped to tinder where there were more girls who were still looking for their first ever relationships with a woman more bisexuals and so on the story completely changed. I talked to far more girls had much less rejection etc. And I met my girlfriend pretty much instantly who was a lesbian but had never been with anyone before for more than a kiss. Im sure my body put off some people but those people wouldnt have matched with me but I still got plenty of matches on tinder. Most importantly try not to take things personally. If someone isnt completely interested in you then they arent the right person for you anyway. Waiting for someone who is worthy is worth the wait! ,actuallesbians,dcpssn5,13,t5_2rch0

So I would end up giving myself these pep talks but since it was for a friend I had to really mean it if that makes sense.

Really there is more to life. Yes you are gay but that shouldnt stop you from being who you are and living a full life. Do you have any hobbies or interests? Try taking up something new meet new people and work on yourself. Build positivity there.If you feel negative watching things on TV then dont watch it. Like other people said watch LGBT related shows. You say you havent dated anyone yet well there is another reason for your feelings of envybitterness. Try doing something about it. Such as joining an lgbt clubonline dating etc. Find out whats going on in your city and try making queer friends. Hope this helps good luck. ,actuallesbians,ddc5vi4,7,t5_2rch0

10662281,0,t1_ddfpy02,I see where youre coming from. There are definitely physical and emotional and sexual differences between dating men and women and being bi I can recognize and acknowledge this but those differences dont matter as much hence the hair color analogy when youre with someone you like. And I think bicycles typically work the same way we have phases where we might be superficially more attracted to a gender for that time period but that doesnt stop us from being genuinely attracted to or connected to the other gender as well. I dont think the hair color analogy is meant to prove we dont feel like were missing out rather to draw attention to the fact that gender is about as relevant to attraction for us as hair color.,actuallesbians,ddfqeey,3,t5_2rch0

Larger areas cost more of course but its still not THAT expensive when you factor in how much youre paying for razors and the cutsrashesetc. you gotta deal with on top of it.

But it was all very surreal. It was a Pentecostal church so very crazy people talking in tongues people falling over and rolling around on the ground.The pastor guy is super wealthy and a total scumbag. I updated the churchs Wiki page to put all his scummy info in. For example our government was having a vote on allowing same sex marriage. Each electorate MP had a vote and the guy for my electorate put up a little voting button on his website keep in mind this is a conservative guy who has been the electorate MP since  so he was trying to be open minded. The church pastor told his congregation to go to the MPs page and keep voting no to skew the results. The IT guys for the website figured it out anyway and deleted all the multiple votes.  ,actuallesbians,ddo5kfs,2,t5_2rch0

She said shed love you the same whether you were gay or straight and she means that.  If she said it completely randomly that means she was thinking about it.  You dont make statements like that out of the blue if you dont believe them.  If anything youll be closer after talking to her.  Shes more likely to be happy that you trust her enough to come out to her.And once you come out to your mom youll have somebody to sympathize with or bounce ideas off of.  You cant overestimate how good that feels.My other advice is to come out in any way you feel comfortable.  Personally I shut down when Im emotional.

But I really want to know... Are you really worried about the stretch marks or are you worried she will gain weight again? Either way if youre worrying about it now and youre not even dating I would say walk away. She isnt right for you.Edit And if it is you that lost all the weight and have stretch marks and loose skin fucking own that shit girl!! It is your journey and what an amazing story it tells!!

10963913,0,t3_5w8e60,It definitely sucks. I was very youngnaive when a lot of my family found out. I somehow thought there was no way it would go badly despite some very clear homophobia being aired at family gatherings. I took it personally for so long kept my romantic life so separate. I thought I was over it years later after having grown up and moved  miles. But my gf now fiance pointed out that wven if they visit our home I shy from her touch how ever innocent. I realised then how much I was still affected by their words and actions from years ago. And it was exactly then that I got peeved enough to stop caring. I forced myself past it and slowly but surely started being myself around my partner when they were present. Now I literally couldnt care. If they turned around and said the same things it would sting Im sure. But Im also old enough to know that if theyre upset that Im happy healthy and marrying my best friend  thats their messed up issue. ,actuallesbians,deaumio,1,t5_2rch0

It might just be a case where its easier to talk to her because you knew she was interested.

By the end of therapy I realised what was going on and basically stopped reacting and started to gently challenge the control. She didnt like that and started to out and out call me delusional. And I still worry that maybe I did destroy her and owe her this huge debt of something for the good things she did do. I thought it was just me being crazy again.

11344690,0,t1_dfhtl89,Have you talked with your husband about your lack of sexual attraction to him? I imagine its been an issue for the two of you over time. Even in relationships where the sexual orientation of both partners is compatible a mismatch in sex drives can be enough to slowly destroy a marriage over time. If hes straight and you are not that takes that issue up a notch even further. I am not advocating for you to upend your life instantly or make an impulsive decision but you should really evaluate a if your husband is able to meet your needs either directly or by letting you experiment outside of your marriage and b if you are capable of meeting his needs too. Some people make it work through open marriages usually but that is a hard road for its own reasons. Its not fair to either of you in the long run if you feel like you are forcing yourself to give up your ability to love romantically and sexually and he feels unfulfilled in the same way. As difficult and traumatic as ending a marriage is a lifetime of bitterness and resentment is worse. ,actuallesbians,dfhwfm8,3,t5_2rch0

Im exactly like you too the whole liking girls more than guys bc I technically am bi but have thought about it and really dont ever see myself with a guy. Thats also been a factor in not coming out the thought that maybe I will like a guy and Ill have to face arent you gay questions. I did date a guy that I really liked v recently and I could see a future with him but as bad as it sounds it feels like that would be my last option. Thanks for replying though! I know you said i could message you but Im new to reddit so dont know how that works lmao but you can definitely message me and Ill figure it out bc we literally sound the same and Im always down to talk to someone  ,actuallesbians,dflvmww,2,t5_2rch0
11384428,0,t1_dflsc9k,I had an idiot kid like me on HER. The profile was sketch as hell but there are zero queer women on any dating app within a  mi radius of my town so I liked Will back. So I casually exchanged messages with the dude most of which I screenshotted and sent to one of my friends because this guy was mildly insane. He was one step away from being a prepper and very obviously a dude even if he didnt outright say it.Eventually he decided that he had to come clean and sent me a long rambling message that he just wanted to see if anyone was on the app like was he planning on going on a lesbian safari?? and only liked my profile cuz I looked interesting and I listed myself as bisexual so thought he had a chance. He then legit wanted to date me and I killed myself laughing. Ignoring the fact that I dont date men he listed his age as . That is way too young for me and what  year old guy wants to get with a  year old woman??So yes five minutes of convo  A CHANCE TO GET IN HER PANTS is exactly what that other dude was hoping for.For the record I look boring. Every picture is of me jamming in a derby bout gotta show off that star and the only text on my profile is lol I really like derby or something stupid like that.

They range from sprays and collars to pills the animal takes with its food. I have yet to come across a pet to whom all products fail if they dont do well with medication try a spray type product or a collar. Other than that they obviously need plenty of water maybe a little treat though you might want to be careful with that if youre unsure whether or not theyre going to throw up again and a comfortable safe carrier box. It sometimes helps to have their favourite toy  with them too provided said toy isnt made of plastic or anything that may hurt them along the way.Whenever possible I move my own pets on a leash and in my arms. Id literally rather use public transport at calm moments of the day and have them snuggled away in my arms while they maintain a sense of freedom than having to put them in a box knowing it stresses them out like crazy.

11423837,0,t3_631gxv,Not really the same situation but the closest thing I can think of my grandfather died  years ago before I was born. My grandmother is in her mids now. They were married when she was  and he was .One day I asked her how she managed to cope all these years without him and she told me that she still cries for him. She said it doesnt just go away you cope one day at a time. Each day is harder than the next but you somehow manage and then it starts to get easier. You find ways to full some of that void small things that bring you some happiness again. And then you suddenly realize its been  years and you have lived a full life without them. And that is Ok. Part of life is loving and letting go but I know that love doesnt just die. Ive never met my grandfather but I feel like I knew him because he lives on in the memories of my grandmother who talks about him often. Although I dont have personal experience and cant even imagine what youre going through I do know  things  You will be Ok. It will take time to grief and come to grips your loss and  no two people grieve the same way. You are allowed to feel however you need to feel. There isnt a right or wrong way to survive a loss like this. But one way or another you will make it through.I am so sorry for your loss.

11750629,0,t3_67musv,Its not a huge part of my identity but thats influenced by how me being trans often invalidates my sexuality in a lot of peoples eyes so its harder for me to own it when Im around people who dont accept that part of me since no one really ever treats me like Im gay.. I mean I do a lot to embrace that part of me I involve myself in communities that accept that part of me however few they are I help with education and activism and it guides most of the media I consume and interact with but theres always limits. Nearly all accept that Im trans even if they may not treat me well because of it so it permeates my entire life. When Im one of the few that accepts that i can be and am a real lesbian that means it doesnt really impact my life at all in an external sense. ,actuallesbians,dgryorx,2,t5_2rch0

11761264,0,t3_67oyum,Im in a  year relationship with another woman that is the forever kind but if that were to suddenly change and I found myself single Id probably do a bit of bed hopping including multiple partner situations.  So I have nothing against people wanting to sleep with multiple people at once regardless of the sex of the people involved BUT that shit only works when its upfront and respectful seriously even if I was looking for that kind of hook up the situation you described would put me off straight away.,actuallesbians,dgt637u,7,t5_2rch0

11779785,0,t3_682pkg,My take? She is afraid. She is afraid of getting attached and then trying to maintain a long distance romance. I dont think she is playing you. Based on the texts and what you have described she seems afraid insecure and uncertain.,actuallesbians,dgv9yaj,4,t5_2rch0

11809148,0,t3_68hogt,I saw this posted somewhere else recently and a commenter called it straightguilt clickbait which I think is pretty accurate. I get that its hard to read people but like...
