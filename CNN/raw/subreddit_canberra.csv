1448893,0,t1_cixqr2p,Light rail is part of a broader plan to increase density along the CivicGungahlin corridor. Light rail increases property value near the line drawing development to the area. Widening Northbourne into an  lane road would have the opposite effect. It would be a noisy unsightly freeway carving through the heart of the city. Massive roads also decrease walkability. Costperpassenger is a pretty narrow analysis of public transport infrastructure you also have to consider how the line will effect liveability and development. For example Above ground rail is much much cheaper than underground rail and it moves the same amount of passengers but one is obviously much more desirable than the other.,canberra,cixw7hc,4,t5_2r584

2370167,0,t3_2mg86m,Whats the event? Fancier than normal but can tolerate screaming kids...    IMO having had one  and  month old kids really dont flow with places that are small have no ambiance few customers and slow service. IMO this is pretty tricky in Canberra because places are either empty so you can hear a pin drop and  screaming baby is SOOOOO annoying service is too slow so kids get boredagitated and the clientele are tools who are bossyfull of selfimportance and cant handle real things like screaming babies i.e. they make you feel bad instead of ignoring this stuff and moving on with their boring unimportant lives.    None of my suggestions are classy but I think they all have a bit of a vibeambiance which look... to me is what makes a good restaurant. Forget white table cloths fancy BS on the menu and overpriced wines. I have nothing personally against Manuka and have suggested Legends but IMO just stay away from that area. Tough to find parking lots of snobby tools and most of the restaurants arent designed for kids to sit around screaming their heads off. Especially some of the places listed... youll get asked to leave if a baby makes a small sound.      I reckon you could get away with   The Dickson Dumpling house always packed and lots of people so nobody will hearcare if theres a kid crying... also its mostly dumplings and REALLY fast so the kids wont get too boredtired waiting around.   Pho Hub in Belco... its very new so looks alright and in my experience they use a LOT of staff so are really fast. Id say Can Tho instead but I guess its your call with presentation maybe a bit too casual? In their defence they are arguably Canberras best Vietnamese restaurant are FAST FAST FAST foodout before you sit down kinda thing HUGE always packed and very much used to catering for loud families.   Harem in Kingston... its MASSIVE and has the pillow area where you can sit down with your babies feed them let them roll around...etc. They do banquets so again you can save time by just ordering a banquet and eating as the food comes out.   Kashmir House Narrabundah... deceptively large and really fast because they also do lots of takeaway.   Legends Manuka... really big and a LOT of noiseambience... one of those places where a screaming kidss not going to get heard. Sometimes a little slow but thats life.   Any of those taco houses around civic... IMO Beach Burrito Company is really fast and kid friendly. Honkytonks to an extent although its more of a bar and gets packed with youngsters... Id almost say Elk and Pea but they are sooooo farking slow! Your kids will die waiting...   Oh... and whatchamacallit? Chong Co in Woden. I went there recently. Huge lots of parking nearby and has a vibe about it so kids blend in. We literally had a kid standing on one of the tables... the staff were cool about it helped out and didnt make us feel embarrassed about taking our kids there. It looks really nicenew too!    A lot of Asian restaurants? Maybe Im biased but I find Asian restaurants do families really well. For example while something like Caphs in Manuka is a nice family restaurant... a lot of old people go there and service isnt all that fast. I think youd feel a bit awkward having young kids in there. Anything more fancy I dont think Manuka does fancy... just wnky? IMO Youll feel like youre being forced outjudged the whole time whereas you SHOULD be treated like a top customer because youre bringing in a few hundred bucks for them.  ,canberra,cm4nt4o,-4,t5_2r584

There are walking tracks to the peak. While there is no public road access to the peak there is a fire trail up the mountain from the end of Waldock St Chifley where there is also a car park and picnic tables. The fire trail also known as the management trail is normally closed to public vehicular access by locked gates but the gates contain access points for walkers. The trail is especially popular with families and older walkers as it provides the easiest and most leisurely access to the peak. Originally a dirt road it was partially sealed in  on the steeper grades to make it safer for walkers and mountain bike riders.gtgtImage iRelevant Australia | Canberra | History of the Australian Capital Territory Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcsmx oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecsmx.

11704525,0,t1_dgmq2a7,Governments take time to approve maintenance. The article did state fairly explicitly that some were fixed in a timely manner some were not. If the government needs a prod then the article was the right way to do it. even if the title is editorialised Having said that I have  problems with borrowing money on Mr Fluffy and Light Rail. Interest rates are fuck all at the moment anyway one is a public safety issue another is infrastructure with a decades long shelf life. A single convention centre or sports stadium would not generate as much productivity or revenue in terms of urban renewal and community benefit many new projects along the northbourne corridor for example are springing up and infrastructure projects like these while far more costly are more beneficial on a wider scale than a single stadium or otherwise.,canberra,dgmq79a,4,t5_2r584
