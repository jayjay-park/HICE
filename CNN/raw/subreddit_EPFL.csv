3499445,0,t3_309c3o,You have to ask yourself  You have a chance to fail again but was it because of your health problems or more because you didnt work enough ? Second question  Do you already have failed courses or can you pull everything up again if you work hard enough ?If there is a chance to pass by working really hard do it. For every credit you should work around  hours each week. Some can do with less but a lot of students need more to get good grades. During my studies I pulled quite good grades and spent am  pm during the week and a lot the number depending on the projects and homeworks during the weekends.If you take into account that french is not your mother tongue you should add some hours to that. I dont know how well you speak it or what your mother tongue is but a lot of professors and their staff speak english and usually a number of diverse languages from around the globe. Try to identify someone that speak the same language as you and go ask them a number of questions. They will quite probably help you a number of them are also students from other years and want to help you  I was one of them and our team got out of our way to help students that worked hard.. It would probably also helps that they will know you as a hard worker when they will correct your exam.Also if you know a number of people in you classes try to work with your classmates it will be a lot easier to stay motivated and get explanations if you have questions. People always say that you have to work at the RLC but for me the RLC was the worse place to work. During my studies we were a bunch of people working in some classrooms around the EPFL depending on the availability discussing homeworks throwing projects around when needed ...As for the administrative side of the things there can be some things that could perhaps allow you to retake some exams. If you have medical certificates that explains that you skipped a lot of classes and could not succeed the exams you can go to your studies advisor look it up for your section shehe is usually very nice and can pull off a large number of things for you if you are nice to them. They were able to swap coursescredits in my options group and mandatory courses so that the number of credits was ok and I did not have to spend one additional year for  credits.Again on the administrative side after the exams there is a discussion about students that are just under the passing grade to give what is missing if they think that they are worth it so to speak. Do not depend on this but know that even if you fail one course because of some very bad grade you got in the first semester some fluke can always happen and did a superb grade at the end of the year they could make you pass.TLDR Work really hard and some more it is better than hoping to get a third chance.,EPFL,cpr5udc,1,t5_2svyx
