2392825,0,t1_cm7crtn,I agree with a lot of this.  This sub is definitely an interesting idea.  It could be really cool if people actually use it.  We could potentially do like ukoehlerr and use our school username to make it easier or we could just do like you said and just use something associated with our real life.  Either way seems rad enough.Kristin,msmsdiscussions,cm7gl6z,3,t5_34om0
