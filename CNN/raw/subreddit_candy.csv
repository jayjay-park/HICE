2547368,0,t3_2bjx8f,Theres some subscription based services like this. Honestly though Id just pick a country and find an online store that sells that stuff. My latest candy obsession is Scandinavian candy  amazing Gummies sours licorice and chocolate stuff. Sockerbit.com has  flat rate shipping regardless of how much you get so its a great deal. Good luck. ,candy,cmr2tc7,1,t5_2qmpx

4794403,0,t3_3ghzb6,omg i had something that looked just like this but it was a sort of chewy type taffy or something. I got it from my friend when he went there.

11112601,0,t3_5yl7hk,I wonder if its especially hard to do a candy recall  vs a car recall?  Candy is everywhere and thus requires many more vendors and people to be aware of the recall.  Grocery stores gas stations vending machines charities.    Or maybe Im overthinking it. ,candy,derlr4i,1,t5_2qmpx
