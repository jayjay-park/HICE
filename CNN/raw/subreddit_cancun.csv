Without any evidence its really hard to tell what happened.I know a number of foreigners that have been living in Quintana Roo for years and other than a mordida for a speed limit they have never experienced something like this.,cancun,dd0r7o7,1,t5_2srnn

11660371,0,t1_dghn0no,We did go to Aventuras Mayas We purchased a package that included snorkeling in the Cenote ATV ride and Ziplining. It was about a half day. Not sure why we picked this place over Xplor. Xplor was closer. Maybe this was cheaper or because of the ATVs GF parents paid for it as a Birthday gift. If you do decide to do this I would take about  cash so you can buy the pictures.Xplor Park Xcaret Park I used the GoPro Hero  Silver. The LCD screen on the back is great to have. The Hero  Black doesnt have that option. I believe the Hero  does have an LCD screen. Even though the Hero  is waterproof without a housing its not a direct replacement in some situations. The old Standard Housing was rated down to  feet m which is plenty deep enough to cover most recreational Scuba diving with an optional extra diving housing if you planned to go deeper. The new cameras are rated down to  feet m without a separate housing.I will PM you a link to some gopro accessories I used as well as the gopros. ,cancun,dghpuo7,2,t5_2srnn
