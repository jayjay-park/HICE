5218449,0,t3_3me6hl,My question is...maybe its the actual girl whos face is photoshopped onto the other girls body that doesnt have that actual exciting life...but is a fan or something of Paul. And she probably has a completely different body. Skype doesnt have the best quality. Shes lying about her body not her face? I dont know. Its odd. ,catfish,cvf0ka8,1,t5_2uo4e

7409006,0,t3_4gsd35,Interesting how the psychic mentioned he first appeared to her when she was writing at her laptop. So weve established shes an author..so what does she write about? ,catfish,d2kctgs,4,t5_2uo4e
7426463,0,t1_d2lvp5r,BoyfriendHusband  not son.  But I think the sons age could also determine when the episode was shot. ,catfish,d2mcaby,1,t5_2uo4e
7427394,0,t1_d2mfued,Cold reading is quite clearly not the mechanism at play here. It would not explain Courtneys initial contact and the flood of details that she provided. Its also very rare for cold reading to achieve so many veryspecific hits. Plus charlatans are usually too afraid to expose themselves on international television unless they know beforehand what theyre going to say.,catfish,d2mg3re,12,t5_2uo4e
7460773,0,t1_d2q4mzy,Still cant believe they even aired this tripe. What would be really interesting is to find out who contacted them for this episode. I read that its mostly the catfisher who makes contact with the show. In this case it was probably whoever orchestrated this obvious media coverage for new found businesses.Not sure how they can feel ok about endorsing something that is obviously scamming people who are vulnerable. ,catfish,d2q8rxy,5,t5_2uo4e
7491806,0,t3_4gsd35,Maybe shes actually a medium and channeling is real and everyone is just a skeptic looking to back up their biased disbeliefs. ,catfish,d2ts0cf,4,t5_2uo4e

8455280,0,t1_d5y3xse,Yes she is definitely catfishing you. However her reaction seems sketchy. If you were to find out I was catfishing you I would just tell you everything. I think she is just scared. I recommend just dropping it there is a chance she will come back one day and try speak to you again. Or at least give her time before trying to message her if you can still message her. As shitty as catfishing is it also seriously fucks up the person doing the lying.,catfish,d5yg17k,1,t5_2uo4e

9341486,0,t3_4gugzc,Sorry for posting  months after your post but I wanted to say thank you. I just saw this episode and I was really bothered by it I assumed something was up and I was disappointed they wouldnt dig deeper once they found out that a lot of the info the medium had was easily obtainable via googlefacebook.So reading this post now gave me closure. Thank you uAlexaaaa and umadquirk for investigating further and sharing it! Great work with finding out the truth about the Aunt and everything. I wish the Catfish crew wouldve done it too tho. But I guess the way the episode aired made for a better story.,catfish,d903mz3,3,t5_2uo4e
10008642,0,t1_dbbygdh,The chances of her forgiving you is low indeed. You have nothing to gain if you tell her the truth. There is only risk. But you care for her and she deserves the truth at last and the chance to move on.In fact this is what you have to gain too the chance to form a relationship with someone in the future as the real you. A relationship with real risk to yourself. A relationship where you give and not just get. A relationship not based on your entitlement. Believe me the reward is worth the risk.,catfish,dbc5kwr,1,t5_2uo4e
10041885,0,t3_5jhmv5,I used to enjoy the show and Max in particular but after the psychic episode and Maxs gullibility or pretend acceptance on display there the show has jumped the shark for me... Too bad.,catfish,dbghfhg,1,t5_2uo4e

11466690,0,t1_dfvgl5m,You may see this as shallow but that is certainly a factor. The fact that she lied comfortably to me for a week is the deal breaker though. ,catfish,dfvqqyw,1,t5_2uo4e
11556747,0,t3_64xihd,I met this really fine girl on Chinas Tinder. I thought at first I must be getting catfished. I solved it by telling her write my name on your hand and take a picture holding it up to your face. Before that I also had her send videos. I met up with her in Beijing and she was legit. Man everyone has a phone with a camera. There is literally no excuse in this day and age. Ask for a specific type of photo or video and if they dont do it youre being catfished. Just let go. ,catfish,dg5ym4h,5,t5_2uo4e
