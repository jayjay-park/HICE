For example in my physics class this year we spent septemberapril on IB stuff and then spent the end of april and early may learning the additional concepts for the AP exam. This year i took apush us history and we spent septembermay th doing apush stuff which will count for paper  on the history hl test next year.

How hard you find it will really depend on your previous math experience overall intellectual capacity and ingenuity inclination to work hard and quality of teachers. For reference our school is a fairly good school with an average IBDP grade way above the world average even though our school is not selective about who it takes on to the diploma. We have not had a single candidate score a  in HL math even though we had some very intelligent people come through. I think this is largely due to gcse maths being the only preparation prior to HL which is not at all adequate.

Maybe someone will have a better way to answer a particular question than the way it is answered in the mark scheme. I also have another option which we can do along the past papers. We find the Math HL textbook in PDF so that every person can download it. And the task for the week is to complete a set of problems from the textbook. The whole idea is for us to do the same paper or problems so we can discuss it in a post this way we will feel obliged to complete it. I am also very keen on doing this with all the subjects.

I wrote mine on The Secret History and The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt.,IBO,ctma1y1,2,t5_2s05l

4867142,0,t1_cu7gsa2,gtwhy is it hard to write a Psych EE without the course?Mostly it is a question of methodology and an understanding of the subject as a whole. How do you know you are making valid criticisms for example? Can you imagine writing a physics EE if you hadnt taken the subject in IB?  A lot of what we cover on the course is at a first year university level you would need to get up to speed on a general understanding before you could really properly tackle the essay.gt Do you think PTSD would fall under that category?Yes it does and it is horribly complex. Part of the issue is that even simple diagnosis is very hard to do and is a huge debate in itself. If you are determined to do this you really need to link your understanding of another IB subject to psych. Something like business or biology might be plausible.,IBO,cu81gsz,2,t5_2s05l
4875248,0,t1_cu8ysoq,Tips for chemistry? I rewrote a lot of my notes did a lot of practice questions and watched Richard Thornley if I couldnt understand something he makes videos on YouTube for IB chem.Fundamentally Id say focus on the why of the topics just as much as if not more than the how. Ask questions like why is a salt bridge needed in a voltaic cell instead of just memorizing that voltaic cells need a salt bridge. I think thats part of the reason chem is way more detailed than other subjects.Good luck fellow chemE! ,IBO,cu92aqp,1,t5_2s05l

Just make sure that you equip yourself with the tools you need to continue in the direction you want once you have finished with IB.Many of my psych students barred entry to their first uni choice because they didnt take HL maths though they did get in to decent uni with SL and MS.,IBO,cu9e1mc,3,t5_2s05l

5072419,0,t3_3kfw9n,For me school starts at am and ends at pm. I have extracurriculars between pm to pm and get home at pm. Shower  food  pm before I can actually do anything substantial. Just use the free time throughout your day it feels as if there isnt much but passing time lunch prep periods are all extremely valuable time periods. If I know I have a lot of homework and no time Ill occasionally sacrifice a lunch to get things done. Otherwise just prioritise your homework. Say you have a worksheet on Biology on DNA Transcript vs a worksheet in Chem for EnthalpyEntropy calculations. Do you really need to do that worksheet for Bio that you already understand well or should you do the Chem homework instead? Probably not the best example but its important to remember that homework is often a review of what you learnt in class that day and if theres a concept that you dont understand its probably best that you prioritize the homework for that class instead. Also honestly? If you can do homework in class. Some of my classes have homework posted on the boardinternet at the beginning and if its textbook readingnote taking or such Ill just listen to the teacher talk and do the homework. This is generally how I deal with it  I guess Ive become used to it since Ive had this schedule since Freshmen year. Remember time management comes from practice!

Thus I believe it doesnt hurt to put some more pressure on the IB to lower the grades and provide collective feedback. Furthermore the petition is to tell the examiners that the test was too difficult and demands of the tests not properly introduced. I for example got around  on every mock without revising at all. I have revised for the exams and I was only able to answer  of the questions.

Once you feel fine presenting in front of them. Ask a few more friends maybe people who youre not as comfortable around. And repeat the process until youre practicing in front of an audience the size of the class youre supposed to presenting to. If its a serious fear it will take a serious amount of work to overcome. But thats what your education is about personal growth. If you dont have enough time to devout to overcoming this fear. I suggest speaking to your TOK teacher or Ibo coordinator about this and asking if you can present after class in front of a smaller audience as I understand the minimum is three other students and it can be your close friends that way it will feel a lot less like public speaking and a lot more like talking to your friends about something cool that your researched. ,IBO,d6gpch8,6,t5_2s05l

8897113,0,t1_d7geppg,EDIT Talked to my mentor said i should change my RQ from industry changing from a monopoly to oligopoly..This comment made me realize that I might not really have been answering my RQ the whole time...The exact RQ i have right now is To what extent has Uber dismantled the GTA taxi industry oligopoly and moved it towards perfect competition? So what I was doing before was focusing on just Uber but now I have to connect it to the taxi industry including Uber as a whole and Im not sure how to do that!Barriers to entryexit The taxicab regulation still exists obviously but Uber has simply been able to bypass the regulation by just making an app? Would I have to talk about stuff like this somehow  Or do I have to talk about requirements for becoming a driver or is that not even relevant??So if Uber has low barriers to entry but the high barriers still exist what does that mean to the overall barriers to entry of the taxi industry? How do I identify the balance? Number of sellers How do I determine the number of taxi firms and their market shares? Doesnt Uber really only add  more major firm but how do I determine its market share? Do I have to also focus on how Uber has also led to other firms like Lyft being apart of the market?I am quite a but more confused now D,IBO,d7hb0kv,1,t5_2s05l

I understand that I could have volunteered to help at the elderly home earlier but just because I didnt help them before September  does not mean that I did not or do not care about the elderly. You quoted Hated chore where did you quote this from? I never used anything close to those words. Or did you use those words in quotations because you assumed thats how I felt about this CAS activity?She replied back saying please just do for CAS what you were supposed to do since September  and all will be fine.

But you have to use IBDPC to upload through eCourseWork not directly. It has a antiplagiarism software builtin called CACTUS when it reaches IBIS it has already went through that scan. And the coord. can see that and other things and approve the submission to IB.,IBO,dfjr5j0,1,t5_2s05l

11560900,0,t3_64yp8e,Math HL is the only class that really matters for CS. You absolutely should take it. Getting a  puts you in the pool for top UK unis. IB CS is an okay course but it is very not demanding at all. Not a bad idea to take HL.  Physics is a good choice. Im assuming youre good at mathy stuff in which case you should have a fairly easy time with it even at HL. History is a tough course with a high worklosd thats difficult without a good teacher. If you like it take it but keep that in mind. You wont need chemistry and you cant even take cs physics and chem. I applied for a similar engineering program in the UK but seriously considered taking CS so if you have any question feel free to ask me. ,IBO,dg6fkwx,3,t5_2s05l

11648030,0,t3_65zs4e,The school year in Australia starts in February and you apply around SeptemberOctober since you get offers based on your final grades. Im applying to Australia and my brother studies in Australia as well. I wouldnt stress over it its just an Australian thing to start in February esp. bc theyre in the Southern Hemisphere so the seasons are the other way around and yadda yadda.Since youre Australian you could totally apply for the July intake but its not recommended bc theres a very small gap between when the IB results come out and when you actually have to start school. So like the uni could start but you still dont have a confirmed admission or something along those lines. Also July intake means Sem  so youd also have to go through the Sem  course and whatevers happening in Sem  and its just not recommended for IB students.Just think of it as a break from IB to clear your head and get your shit together. You could also do some small jobs like working at a caf or get an internship if possible since thatd look good on a CV. Goodluck for your exams!,IBO,dggbgvv,1,t5_2s05l
